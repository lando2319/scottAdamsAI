good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization yeah it's the best thing
that's ever happened to you and probably
it's going to get better and all you
need to make that happen is a copper M
Glass a tanker Cher Stein a canteen suer
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
it's the dopamine to the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
a simultaneous Sip and all you sipsters
better get on it
go I'm thinking of making a merchandise
for the simultaneous beyond beyond the
uh coffee cup uh bedroom slippers
bedroom slippers and they would they
would be
labeled the simultaneous
slippers yeah that's my
idea well I saw a post today that I can
add to the list of reasons people don't
have
children reasons people don't have
children so you know it's expensive and
you know that um well it's expensive and
there about a million reasons not to
have children and of course that's going
to have a big impact on the population
going
forward but on top of that I saw a uh a
post by somebody called newa newa
peasant who said has anyone else
concluded that the typical K through 12
school schedule is Impractical unnatural
and
exhausting does anyone else find it odd
that everyone just goes along with it
and acts like it's normal to spend hours
a day in your car slepping tired
children to and fro how many of you have
had this
experience that this is my experience in
you know two separate families in my
my life and and the entire time I'm
doing it I'm saying to myself oh this
this system can't
be this can't be something that people
agree with there's no way that people
think this is
okay from from the moment the kid wakes
up at least in the school system where I
the kid you know has to do everything
they can to get to
school immediately after school they
might have like a sport or an activity
or a thing you got to pick them up and
drive them to but here's the thing if
you've got two kids there's a good
chance they're going to two separate
schools because you know you got your
grade school and your middle school and
your high school if you have three kids
they might be in three separate schools
and you might have to drive them each to
each and you'd have to take them to all
their activities afterwards which would
be impossible because they're all at the
same
time somebody raised seven kids yeah the
the system for raising children is so
impractical that going from one kid to
three kids is it becomes almost
impractical so if you want to have more
natural reproduction and not have to
depend on immigration you need to fix
all of that stuff in fact one of the
strongest Arguments for
homeschooling is to get rid of that
forced driving it in my opinion there
are years of a family's life that are
destroyed by the inefficiency of the
school system the school system that
says you got to take a sport after
school or you go don't go to college you
know stuff like that um yeah I think the
whole thing is so poorly designed it
guarantees lower reproduction and lower
happiness it's really hard to be it's
really hard to be a happy family with
two or three kids in the middle of the
week
it's just really hard to find you know
carve out any happiness in that
situation it's just a forced March so
you should
write well the most important news is
that there's a video of John Cary at a
big climate event and as he's talking
there's the alleged sound of a big
fart now some say it's John Carrey
farting some say it's just a sound may
not be a fart at all but what I like to
think is that
um I like to think that the chef who is
doing all the meals for this
event I like to think he's a Blazing
Saddles fan and kind of a practical
joker and he thought it'd be really
funny to serve them all baked beans and
have it turn into a scene for Blazing
Saddles so so I just have this picture
if you remember the Blazing Saddle scene
where they they all eat beans the
Cowboys and they sit around
the campfire and they just have
outrageous gas and that's a whole
joke I remember I'm just picturing this
entire scene except instead of the
Cowboys it it's all the climate people
so it's John Cary it's Greta you know
it's Bill
Gates and and they're just coming from
lunch well do do I have to complete the
picture can can I depend on you to f
finish the picture in your heads so I
don't have to get into the details but
it would be very funny very funny and uh
if AI were sufficiently Advanced I would
go to my text to image Ai and I'd say uh
do a scene that's like the Blazing
settles uh Bean scene except put in the
climate people John Cary make sure you
throw in Greta and uh make sure that the
farts are really loud and funny
sounding it would take me like 5 minutes
to type that in and I'd have the
greatest meme of all
time well another news did you all see
the video of the house that exploded in
Arlington so I guess police had some
suspicion about a per and they surround
the house and the and the whole thing
just goes B bam you know it didn't just
blow up a little bit like it blew up
completely now here are the things we're
hearing today none of this makes
sense the entire house exploded because
of a flare gun so they're thinking that
the flare gun might have ignited some
gas from an oven or something and blew
up the whole house maybe but then here's
the funniest thing they're saying that
nobody died and the perpetrator might
still be
inside inside what the entire house is
gone
how could he be inside the house that's
gone and he what what did he did he blow
up the whole house and he didn't die
he's in the middle like laying under a
couch somewhere and saying this is the
best plan I ever had once they they'll
never know that I'm under this
Rubble was that his
plan and then and then apparently some
people say he's posting on social media
could that be
true and uh I guess he's a cyber
security expert so that makes it
interesting he's a big anti-us
intelligence person his his last name is
you and he looks like he's Chinese
American so people are saying is he a
spy of some kind because you're racists
you're all
racists that's your
problem well the funniest part of the
story is that his last name is U it's
James U
Yoo
and if your last name is
you wouldn't you change your name just
to make things
easier
so who wants to pick up the
garbage you no I don't I didn't no not
you not not you
you all day long all day long everywhere
he would be like excuse me no oh you oh
not you but you okay got it what a mess
what a mess yeah change that name but
the part of the story that was not
reported but I I very much suspect is
that I don't think James U was in that
house I think
James I think John Cary might have
been I'll wait I'll wait for you to
connect the dots I'm here all day I'll
just be all
day I'll just use my phone I'll wait all
right everybody catch up every
everybody's up to speed all right all
right I don't want to have to explain
that
joke all right so we'll find out what's
going on with the exploding
house but that's fun all right um let's
talk about UFOs so here's the score so
far we have 10
whistleblowers who have strikingly
similar stories 10 10 whistleblowers
they're on they're on record they seem
like credible
people and they say that there are two
secret programs one for reverse
engineering the uh captured or downed
crafts and one to uh analyze the remains
of the
aliens oh and we're told that there's
not just
one oh not two
not two or three but it turns out we
might have a warehouse just full of down
spacecraft but wait it gets more
interesting apparently say the
whistleblowers the spacecraft are not
totally in the control of the US
government they've actually hired
contractors who have taken possession of
them apparently to study them on behalf
of the
government that's right
we're we're actually doing out uh
UFOs to private
citizens because they might want a
reverse engineering for the government
does any of this sound
real how many of you think any of this
is
real okay I I'd like to go on record as
saying none of this sounds real to me
not not a single bit but but it gets
more interesting gets more interesting
if it's not
real why would anybody object to more
transparency unless it's real but
apparently so uh Chuck Schumer I guess
he and others want some legislation that
would create more transparency and a
controlled release of what the
government
knows here's the fun
part there are at least two people in
the government who are vigorously
opposing that uh one of them is Mike
Turner Republican he's the chairman of
the house intelligence
committee uh
oh uh what does the chairman of the
house intelligence committee
know about these
UFOs that makes him not want to release
it to the
public but he's not the only one you've
also got uh Mike Rogers it's the two
miks Mike Turner and Mike Rogers also a
Republican and uh but he probably
doesn't have an important job in the
Senate he's the he's just the chairman
oh of the house armed services
committee okay that's not
good the chairman of the
house uh armed services committee and
the chairman of the intelligence
committee the people who are most likely
to know the real the real
story don't want the public to know the
real
story what do you
think why would they not tell you unless
there was something to it can you think
of any reason they wouldn't tell you
unless there was something to it yes I
can I can yeah they they don't want you
to know that there's nothing
there they don't want you to know that
there's nothing
there because if you don't know then
China doesn't
know what would be better than having a
nuclear
weapon there's only one thing better
than a nuclear
weapon well two things there are two
things better than a nuclear weapon one
is Advanced alien technology the likes
of which no human could ever understand
that would be put into our Arsenal and
make it impossible to even have a war
with the United States so that's you
know that's one
possibility the other
possibility is that we just want them to
think we have it or think we might have
it so they don't mess with us that seems
far more likely to me it's also probable
that our intelligence agencies have been
lying to the public for 50
years and maybe maybe we don't want want
to tell the public that the intelligence
Community has lied to us for 50 years
about UFOs for the same
reason so I think it's all and
I think that uh the reason is not being
released is not because it would be
secrets that would shock us to our car
but rather the secret would be there's
nothing
there does anybody think there's really
a warehouse full of captured UFOs and we
don't know about
it really really yeah well something do
all right well you might you know I hope
you're
right I really do hope you're
right well three College presidents are
being uh asked to talk to Congress and
answer for their alleged racism it's the
presidents of Harvard uh MIT and the
University of Pennsylvania
now I'm old enough to remember when uh
this kind this type of college was
considered uh a
prestigious and now and now they just
look like racist
idiots now clearly that would be an
exaggeration of what's going on many
qualified people coming in at these fine
institutions but boy I've never seen a
brand reputation drop as quickly as this
except Bud Light I guess uh and yes I
would say that all available information
suggests that they have turned into
massively racist
institutions like
unambiguously massively
racist like just
massively well now here's the
interesting part of the conversation to
me I'm seeing people complaining on
social media that uh
that nobody was complaining about white
people being discriminated against until
it happened to
Jews does that match with your
experience that nobody was complaining
about the mass discrimination against
white people in colleges and
corporations until it happened to Jewish
people I I I'd like to say I've been
saying it for 20 years in
public for 20 years I've been saying it
in public that white people are white
men especially massively discriminated
against in corporations and colleges and
do you know what usually happens when I
said it people would tell me I'm
lying they would actually say you're
lying that didn't happen I'll bet you
were just fired Scott because you were
not a good
employee and then uh I had a number of
black people tell me what's do they have
some insulting word for white
people it's like average white people or
something like that there some word that
is like demeaning that suggests that if
you're an average white person you'll do
great in life but if you're
uh there's there's a specific insult
that they have real racist
insult
anyway but uh no jokes on you it's been
the case for 40 years and uh as Adam
towns and said on X first they came from
Mega and I said
nothing because that's exactly what
happened they came from Mega and a lot
of were silent about
it and here you go it just got worse
just like you would
expect well if there's anything I've
told you over and over again in politics
you know how people are always reading
minds they're like if Trump does this
what he's really thinking is this no you
can't read minds uh What uh somebody
somebody said is this and I say okay
that's what they said but you're
interpreting what they're thinking
that's different and you can't read mins
so can we all agree there's no such
thing as mind reading everybody on the
same
page have I finally convince you finally
all right my next story is uh there's
some new technology to read
minds damn it damn
it I thought I was just getting ahead of
this thing and I lose again yeah so they
use AI Brian rell's talking about this
um there's a new discovery AI was able
to reconstruct images from your
brain with 75%
accuracy that's right they could put
some kind of sensors on your head and
they could reproduce what you're
thinking with 75% accuracy now you've
seen this before it's not the first time
you've seen a story like this but they
seem to have increased the accuracy from
about 50% you basically a coin flip to
75% but the 50% was not a coin flip I
should let me clarify that I don't mean
there's a 50% chance of guessing and a
50% chance of got it
wrong is not a coin flip I'm talking
about they can look in your head and the
and the Machine will draw a picture of
the
beach and then they'll ask why you're
thinking about you go I was thinking
about the beach now that's not
50% because you could have been thinking
about an infinite number of things and
50% of the time half of the time it
could pick out your exact thought from
an infinite selection so that's not a
coin flip that's like the most
remarkable thing you've ever heard in
your life
that 50% just went to
75 do you think it's going to stop at
75
nope nope it's not so mind reading is
real how many of you saw uh Jake Tapo
CNN interviewing members of the
Atlantic uh a disreputable disgraced
publication uh Jeffrey Goldberg is
editor there he's another one of those
disgraced
journalists um now if you didn't know
and I always I always tell you that you
can't understand the news until you know
the players right if I just said there's
a big publication called the Atlantic
and they wrote a story you wouldn't know
anything because you'd have to know who
they are before you understood the
story who they are are basically a
hitpiece Organization for Democrats and
who Jeffrey Goldberg is is someone that
at least Republicans say is one of the
most famous journalist
Liars uh in the business right so this
is the lowest level of credibility
there's
probably I don't think there's a
publication operating today that has a
lower reputation than the Atlantic now
how many viewers would know
that how how many CNN viewers would know
that the Atlantic is a gigantic red flag
for a no doubt about it it's
just a a biased publication right you
wouldn't know that you might think oh
I've heard of the Atlantic that's
probably a serious publication nothing
like that is the case I'm not sure they
try there there's no indication that
they're trying to be legitimate it looks
like they're trying to be exactly what
they look like a Democrat
political
organ
anyway so the Atlantic is leading the
charge to get the public brainwashed
into thinking that uh they can determine
what's in Trump's brain and that this
time will be different than the first
time so after several years of nonstop
telling us that Trump was going to
become a dictator and nothing like that
happened and all he did was remove
regulations and remove government
interference and didn't start any wars
and it was the the literal opposite of
everything they
said so instead of saying okay we better
try something new they're doubling down
on the thing that we observed didn't
happen but this time oh this time they
can read his mind it's going to happen
but this time they have evidence for
example they will they will point to
January
6 as a clear indication of his Criminal
Intent and his his desire to ignore the
Constitution and more than that they now
have a quote from Trump saying that he
wants to destroy the
Constitution so I guess that's that's a
dictator am I right if he wants to
destroy the Constitution I mean that's
what that's all
about so let me tell you what's really
happening here so the Atlantic is just a
Democrat tool and they're s they're
basically sending out the message to all
the other Democrats that the message
that they want to push is that even
though it didn't happen before unless we
can sell you that January 6 was was a
dictator kind of a thing if we can sell
you on that then we can sell you that
that's what he really plans he's never
going to leave office he's going to
round up his his enemies and put him in
prison and stuff like
that so watching CNN interview them as
if they are legitimate sources of news
or opinion tells you a lot tells you CNN
is not credible tells you Jake Tapper
should not be listen to and now you know
that the Atlantic is not a publication
you should pay attention to now am I in
the bag for republicans and
conservatives and would I ever say such
a thing about a right leading
publication yeah of course I would yeah
there there are plenty of completely
unreliable right leaning Publications
yeah that's the thing so nobody and
nobody's right all the time but I don't
know I don't know which Republican ones
are just wrong sometimes and which ones
are running an
OP I'm I'm name
one no I'm not going to name one you
know
why because anything I name will have a
bunch of people who think it's
real and it's it's not my day to you
know break your hearts
some people are saying the National
Review Etc um I'm not going to name
names but let's just say it's not unique
to the
left um so let's look at some of the
evidence
here uh you know that one thing we know
for sure and let me let me check your
understanding of the news one thing we
know for sure is that it's illegal to
interfere with the government uh process
as in trying to stop an election
certification and that uh Trump is being
accused uh quite
credibly with being one of
the oh I just lost my
locals that's
funny the locals just went there let me
see if I can bring them
back will they come back
no it's G to make me log in again
huh huh I'm not sure this is real but
let's see if it lets
me
uh all right nothing's working
H I'm going to have to fix
this
give me one
minute uh why do autofill always
autofill with the wrong
stuff that
uh it's hard to put it in passwords when
you're being watched on live stream not
that you know not that you can see it
there there's something about the
processing in the
brain
all right if that doesn't work this is
all I'm going to
try yeah looks like locals is just
down de is a door now okay we will uh
persevere we shall
persevere I think uh I think a number of
the locals people will jump over here to
YouTube in a
[Music]
second all right uh they signed you out
all right so locals is dead some of the
locals peoples are coming over here all
right let me finish my point that was a
great point the one thing you all know
for sure is that there's a law against
interfering with a um a political or a
government process to get the in this
case to get the election certified you
all know that right everybody's aware of
that that's what Trump and the J Sixers
are being accused
of all right did you know this there is
no such
law I found that out
today
today today I found out that the whole
brewhaha about the January Sixers uh
being accused of delaying a government
process there's no law about that do you
know how I know that because three of
the January 6ers uh have something that
the Supreme Court is considering so it
doesn't mean they've taken the case but
they're looking at it and their their
argument is this there is no law like
that there has never been a law like
that and what the uh prosecutors did was
they took a completely different law and
they tried to to stretch it over here's
what the law was that they stretched and
you don't have to be in the Supreme
Court to know that this isn't going to
work there was a law that was passed
because of Enron and Enron destroyed
some
records now apparently it's it was
illegal to uh to ask somebody to destroy
records that would be part of a legal
case but there was a a problem with that
law it didn't it didn't
it didn't say it was illegal for you to
destroy them yourself just weirdly it
was illegal to tell somebody else to do
it but you could do it yourself so they
wanted to close that loophole and they
made it illegal to destroy Rec
Department of Justice
process and they took that law about
destroying records yourself for a
criminal case about a corporation and
they stretched that to the January 6
people can't delay for one day the
certification of the uh the Electoral
people now do you need to be a Supreme
Court Justice to know that if the
Supreme Court takes that case they're
going to say uh pretty obviously this
law was not intended to cover this
situation there's actually no
law that Trump or the January Sixers
have
violated and there never
was Ju Just hold that in your head not
only the fact that the insane amount of
Injustice and obviously there's these
are political prosecutions but the fact
this is worse or maybe not worse
but why didn't I know this until
today why did it take a supreme court
action you know that they haven't taken
the case but they're considering it why
did it take that to raise ra this point
to my
attention what would be a more important
thing for me to know in politics than
whether it was even illegal to protest
and try to get a change made to the
official process it was never illegal
and it's still not
illegal and and people are in jail for
it I think or maybe they're in jail for
related charges I'm not sure how that
works exactly but to imagine that the
most basic thing that Democrats believe
that it was illegal and that Trump was
behind it he wasn't behind it and it
wasn't
illegal he he's innocent twice he wasn't
behind it and it wasn't illegal if he
had
been
amazing
so
um and you people like Glenn greenal are
warning
that it looks like the Democrats are
creating a narrative for assassinating
Trump or jailing him without charges and
the way they're doing that is by telling
you he's so dangerous that the regular
rules probably shouldn't
apply and they're saying it directly
yeah that he's so dangerous blah blah
blah now I don't know any way to
interpret this other than they're
they're uh they're inciting violence are
they not inciting violence it looks
exact like it to
me
so um Jeff Clark um who's an attorney uh
he has a great uh take on on a post he
says the worst of The Atlantics
anti-trump Fest shrift I'm going to have
to look that up but it sounds like a a
really good insulting word I want to use
it a Fest
shrift I don't know what that means
anyway uh the article in the Atlantic is
called if Trump wins has to be this
piece arguing that uh oh they also argue
that President she of China wants Trump
to return as
president is is that the most insane
thing you've ever heard that that he
wants Trump to
return um for years the left has been a
nuclear meltdown that Trump uh had too
many anti-china hawks around him
remember Bannon
Navaro so Trump was surrounded by
anti-china hawks and that's what they
were complaining about
before so they have complained that he
was too anti-china and too pro-china and
they didn't even stop a beat between
going from one to the
other hey pick a pick a
complaint I just lost the connection
here
too is that a coincidence
if if we know for sure that the problem
on locals was not on my what are the
odds that two separate platforms would
die on the same
topic it's never happened
before so I'm going to I'm going to
repeat the whole topic
again
Trump is part of a political prosecution
which is now completely clear by the
fact
that there are three January Sixers who
are taking who are trying to take their
case to the Supreme Court because we're
only learning today that that there was
never a law against delaying a
government process there was only a
completely unrelated law that the
prosecutors stretched so far to the
level of absurdity that there's no
there's no serious way that if the
Supreme Court takes the case they might
not but if they take it there's no
serious way that they could um allow it
to go forward it it would clearly be
overturned you don't have to be a
Justice to know
that I'm just testing to see if YouTube
you know blocks me again but we'll see
and then on top of that um comr who's uh
investigating the Biden crime family as
he calls it um now they have a direct
evidence in writing you know they have
the documents showing that Hunter
Biden's comp
was paying Joe Biden on a regular basis
from the company so if Joe Biden had
given money to his father that might
look like just a father helping out his
or you know just a family member helping
out that's not illegal but if it's
coming from the company you you kind of
lose all you lose any uh Illusions you
had that Joe Biden didn't know about
what was happening that he wasn't part
of the operation that it wasn't an
influence pedaling scheme
and that China is is a key part of it
money from China now now that we know
that how ridiculous does it look to see
that the Democrats are saying that China
doesn't want that China really really
wants Trum
Trump don't you think they'd prefer the
guy they're
bribing and have been bribing for
years I think they'd prefer
that don't know well Conor McGregor is
actually looking kind of serious about
running for uh I guess to be president
of
Ireland uh and the people he'd be
running against are you know these old
fossils he might actually win uh even
Elon Musk commented about his odds of
winning you know saying he win with one
hand behind his back um I don't know if
that was just a joke or if he was
showing support but then Conor McGregor
answered back and actually sounded
completely serious
about running for president now how much
would you like to see Conor McGregor if
you don't know he's a you know UFC kind
of fighting
champion I kind of would like
it I hate to say he seems like exactly
the right person for the
job doesn't that sound weird that he
sounds like exactly the right person for
the
job do you know who one of his uh bigger
influences is on the topic of personal
success does anybody know
that no I I can only tell you that um uh
my book had a failed almost everything
and still went big was influential on
his uh
coach and so probably influential on him
but I don't know that for sure I just
know that his coach liked the book all
right coach
Kavanaugh who might be watching if
you're watching
hi all right um do you believe it's true
or a hoax that President Trump once said
that he would be willing to throw out
the
Constitution does that sound like a true
statement because everybody I hear is
saying is true
the Democrats are all quoting it and
they're saying no he wants to throw the
Constitution do you think he said
something like
it because I kept seeing it and it was I
was just ignoring it because it looked
obviously
false but then it seemed like there was
something he said in that domain so I
had to go look for
it so I guess he did post something on
Truth
um and I guess this is what he said so
you tell me how you interp this okay so
this see how you interpret it quote now
this is from Trump and apparently he did
say this do you throw the uh
presidential election results of 2020
out and declare the rightful winner or
do you have a new
election and then he says a massive
fraud of this type in magnitude allows
for the termination of all rules
regulations and articles even those
found in the Constitution Trump wrote in
a post on social um and accus big Tech
of working closely with them blah blah
blah um and then that got quoted as uh
Trump saying he wanted to terminate the
Constitution he wanted to terminate the
Constitution do you see the part that
they left
out so I read the part that they leave
out when they talk about it so he
started with this
hypothetical it starts with a
hypothetical do you throw the
presidential election of 2020 out or do
you have a new
election so he's talking about two
completely constitutional
possibilities which would be triggered
if for example the Supreme Court said oh
this election is too is too sketchy so
you're either going to they're either
going to change the result or say just
run the election again would that be a
process that you would find outside of
the Constitutional Realm would it be
outside the Constitution to have a
conflict about the process to take the
conflict to the Supreme Court and have
the Supreme Court either reverse what
happened or propose a solution such as
another election now that was the
context but if you take that context out
that the two solutions he was talking
about very specifically was a new
election or the Supreme Court reverses
it if you take that out it says he wants
to suspend the Constitution it's a rupar
yeah it's a rupar so I'm going to add
this to the hoax The hoax
list he very clearly is talking about
doing it within the context of the
Constitution uh but he's also saying
it's it's worded terribly but uh he says
a massive fraud of this type in
magnitude allows for the termination of
all rules regulations and articles even
those found in the Constitution now he
says it allows for it is he saying that
he wants to do it as
dictator or does he saying Al uh allows
for as in the system itself allows for
us to um dispute these things and the
system itself allows a resolution within
the Constitutional framework which is he
saying well he's saying it terribly but
it's quite obviously he means it within
the Constitutional
framework now let me ask you
this the re the one and only way you
would disagree with them uh if you
really did a good job of understanding
it is if you thought there was some
question about whether the election was
sketchy or not you know maybe there's a
little doubt that's not good enough
would you agree a little bit of Doubt
shouldn't be enough to overthrow an
election cuz have that every election
but suppose suppose that you had proof
that it was massively
fraudulent under th under those
conditions what American citizen would
be in favor of keeping the
result now that's not the case it's not
my opinion that there is massive
evidence or even any that would be
enough to change the outcome I'm not
aware of any evidence that would change
the outcome but
hypothetically because he's talking
hypothetically
hypothetically if the entire country
could see massive obvious rigging that
did change the outcome that's not the
case but hypothetically if they did what
would be the correct solution the
correct solution would be to rerun the
election or to change the
result but you would do it within
constitutional bounds so Trump did step
in it he did not do a elegant job of
saying what he wanted in a context that
would keep him from this happening so
that's a little bit on him but it's fake
news it's fake news exactly like it look
like so there's a good chance those j6
uh charges against Trump will be dropped
if the three people taking their case to
the Supreme Court if it's found that the
law doesn't apply to them then the
argument should be would be extended to
Trump uh before it even went to trial so
there's a
possibility that the whole thing gets
thrown out now what would happen if the
remember the banking trial that's a
separate one so his banking thing uh he
was already found guilty of exaggerating
his assets but when the bank the deuts
bank Executives um testified they said
oh that's just normal that's normal
customers always exaggerate so we don't
trust them so there was never there was
never any risk that his exaggeration
would have any real world effect the the
process guarantees that he could lie as
much as he wants and it doesn't affect
the outcome it's designed that way that
the bank does their own checking on the
asset values and they made money and
they would do business with them again
they said everything was fine from the
bank's perspective that even after they
know about all the facts they still say
that was no problem on our end because
we're actually a good bank do you know
why it was no problem on their end CU
they know how to make a loan they
understand their own business that's all
it took for them to have no problem at
all so you've got this big old banking
thing that the Democrats were positive
was going to be the crime of the century
not only not the crime of the century it
wasn't
anything it literally wasn't anything at
least of a legal consequence and I'm
guessing that this January 6 thing at
least the part about delaying the uh the
the official process I think that's
actually
nothing actually
nothing and these are the biggest things
that the Democrats have been saying for
years does it surprise you that they're
they have to roll out this dictator
thing
now they they've got to go for the
dictator thing because all the other
things they said didn't pan out do you
remember them he's a clown so he came
can't he can't get anything done they
can't really say that because there is a
body of accomplishment to compare to
Biden and no nobody's questioning
whether he did things you know he did a
better job on the border
Etc so yeah there there's a real
desperation on the Democrat part at this
point to uh to to sell this to
herd all right um Simon Rosenberg
tweeted that the uh economy is actually
amazing and you just don't know it so
I'm going to give you his list he gives
several uh
facts Simon does why the economy is
amazing and doing great actually and you
just you just think it's not good
now going back to my earlier theme do
you remember I told you that if you
don't know the
players then nothing they say makes
sense you got to know the players so who
is Simon
Rosenberg would he be an objective
Observer of fact would he be an
economist because that's what I'd look
to i' look for an economist who is an
objective Observer of fact to tell me
the economy is either good or bad so
let's see what he is I look at his
profile he's a political strategist uhoh
that's a red flag he's a
commentator uh
that's a red flag he's a he calls
himself a hopium purveyor which he means
an
optimist and he's going to say something
optimistic so that that fits um he's
been part of the ndn DNC uhoh Democrat
National Committee the DCCC whatever
that
is he's been part of the Clinton War
Room uh part of ABC News uh oh and then
he says Slava Ukraine oh God oh
God so how do you like his credibility
so
far that's pretty low it's not low
because he's associated with Democrats
it's low because he's he's such a team
player if if this were If This Were a
conservative or Republican and they had
the the opposite but equivalent
profile I'm not sure you should take
them seriously right if they say I am a
team player for my team oh and my team
did great you can ignore that but here
are these signs that the US
economy is doing
well and this will be your test for fake
news all right now I don't know that
these are true so the first question is
are these even true but there's a better
question after that so here are the
claims from Simon Rosenberg Slava
Ukraine uh the US economy the GDP growth
was
5.2% inflation zero last
month
zero uh wage inflation growth remains
robust strongest recovery in the
G7 so we beat those other countries
lowest uninsured rate in US history
lowest I guess that's uninsured um for
healthcare um medium wealth is up
37% since
2020 and the Dow is nearing an all-time
high
now how many of those things are even
true are you telling me the GDP is
5.2% it's not even close to that is it I
thought it was like
three can somebody give me a fact check
on that the GDP is not over 5% % over 5%
would be blazing like no time in my life
right I don't think anytime in my entire
life the GDP has been over five has it
do me a fact check even once in my life
in my entire life has a GDP ever been
over five yeah it's like 3.1 it's around
three so the very first thing is not
even
true how about the second thing
inflation was Zero last
month do you think inflation was Zero
last
month
what
no no it's like he reversed inflation in
GDP did he reverse inflation in GDP or
something I don't know where'd that come
from then he says uh uh wage growth
remains
robust so wages are going up but
inflation is
not okay are there any economists in the
house so wages are going up meaning the
cost to produce things is going up but
the inflation is
not that's the
claim and oh oh is it inflation that's
5'2 and not GDP did he did he literally
reverse inflation in
GDP is that what happened it might
I don't know um strongest recovery in
the
G7 H maybe uh but who who uh has the
biggest
debt can't you have the strongest
recovery if you borrowed the most and is
that a good thing is it a good thing to
be the one that borrowed the
most because that's how you get a fast
recovery you borrow a lot and then the
government spends and that boosts the
economy that's the worst way to to boost
an economy that's bad news not good news
if it's because of borrowing uh lowest
uninsured rate in US history well if
that's talking about Healthcare that
might be true I'll give them that
one the Republicans would say they have
bad healthcare
insurance but probably a lot of uh up
uptick he says the median wealth is up
37% between 2020 and
2022 is that even slightly possible
that's not even slightly possible is
it like I'm not even going to research
that I know medium wealth didn't go up
37% that's insane at no at no time in
history did a number like that ever
happen at no time in
history am I right literally no time in
history including now did wealth ever go
up 37 median wealth up 37 7% in 2
years no not in the 60s you tell me in
the' 60s there was a 2-year period where
median wealth went up
37%
no how about uh the Dow nearing all-time
highs is the Dow nearing all-time
highs I I don't think it
is what all right but here's the funnier
part let's see if you caught it
uh he's saying that infla uh that
there's no
inflation but I would argue that the GDP
is partly an inflation number in other
words whatever that number is everything
costs more so it makes the GDP look like
it's going up the GDP is a fake number
now because of inflation if inflation
were constant and low then the GDP
number is like that's sort of a solid
number you could look at but if
inflation is going up it means the price
of everything is going up so when you
add together the all the things you sold
all you're catching is the inflation
you're not catching any productivity
you're just catching inflation so he's
he's tting the GDP but really it's just
a mark of inflation which is bad at the
moment he says the wage growth remains
robust do you know why wages are
growing because of
inflation w Wes grow because people
can't afford to buy food so the union
says look you're going to have to give
us more money cuz our you know
everything's too expensive now we can't
buy food with this this level of pay how
about
uh uh the median wealth up 37% which of
course didn't happen but let's say the
median wealth did go up do you know why
inflation the the value of my house is
up I don't I don't know 20% in the last
few years but is that because I have
more money now no I have less money I
have way less money way less money than
I did two years ago but my house on
paper is worth more but it's actually
worth
less but on paper it looks like it's
worth more because of inflation so
here's somebody who couldn't sort out
the inflation from the real numbers and
the real numbers from the fake numbers
and if you're a Democrat you're going to
read this and you're going to say wow he
he made a good point
there all right
um you know uh Douglas Mackey you got
convicted for making a meme that uh
mocked Hillary Clinton voters by saying
that the that they could vote by txting
so basically was mocking them for being
dumb thinking they could vote by taxing
but he got convicted because it was
election
misinformation and if somebody believed
it well if they believed it they would
have not voted and that would be bad um
but he got a
motion for an
appeal so it looks like a a higher Court
thought he had enough of a case that
they're going to look at
it I think that here's a conviction will
be thrown
out I'm going to I'm going to predict
that uh he will not be convicted of a
joke but just to give him a little bit
of support uh I showed him the Dilbert
reborn comic that normally is available
only to subscribers but it was about
Dilbert being arrested for a
meme so it was supportive of uh of
Douglas Macky uh he saw it this morning
and thought it was funny I'm glad he can
still
laugh all right uh the next debate
coming up president itial debate on the
Republican side is down to four people
who had enough good polling numbers to
qualify so Chris
Christie made the top
four I did not see that coming I did not
see Chris Christy making the final four
I thought he'd be one of the first first
down but he's there uh so it's DeSantis
Nikki Hy V ramaswami and Chris
Christi now
um I thought that when the Lesser
candidates dropped out that V would get
more of a
bump but to me I think I think V's um
best strategy is the one he's doing
which is the more you see of him the
more he
like now that doesn't mean every one of
you so if if you have the uh if you have
the opposite opinion you know I respect
that but I would say that V was sort of
an unknown you know christe is unknown
the more you know about V the more you
like him so now if you can get him down
to a group of four people in a debate
his power
increases I don't think this see more of
Chris Christie makes you like him more
am I wrong I don't believe extra
exposure makes him extra good um that
might be the case for Nikki Haley but I
don't think it's the case for to santis
so what we might see is both Nikki hilly
and
V make a make a little move here and
then if we see V for example doing well
in one of the first two
primaries could get interesting could
get
interesting all right we'll keep an eye
on
that um apparently a number of big
companies such as meta and Intel and uh
IBM
are launched a coalition of more than 50
uh AI companies and research companies
and they want to make AI more of an open
model they want to make it open so that
whatever happens in AI is available to
the industry in general now do you know
why they want to do
that because they all lost these are all
the losers these are the people who do
not have or in their own minds
apparently they don't have a shot at
being the AI company so they can't
compete with Gro they can't compete with
open AI they probably can't compete with
ever whatever Apple's going to come up
with apple is notably missing in
this uh Amazon Amazon is notably
missing probably because those are two
companies that will have their own
proprietary AI so all the losers are
pretty scared and they're like um we
were in a lot of trouble if we don't
have ai so oh I've got an idea uh AI
should be open yeah that's it everybody
should have access to
it so we'll see what happens with that
um do you think that Trump wants a
revenge and to punish his
critics do you think that's true CU he's
he says it directly he wants revenge so
should you be afraid of him because he
wants revenge
do you think that Trump will weaponize
government if he's elected will he
weaponize government to go after
Democrats yes he will yes he
will will will those Democrats be people
who did real crimes and should really
pay probably probably so how you feel
about this has more to do with whether
you think that is Justified if you think
he's just going after political iCal
enemies well it's the worst thing in the
world I'm not in favor of that at all if
you think that he's going after using a
legal process people who did flagrantly
illegal things to him and tried to end
the Republic as we know it well then it
sounds a little better because
Revenge here's how I hear it when Trump
says Revenge I don't really hear it like
Revenge you know I'm too close to it I
I'm I'm too to uh involved here's how I
hear it I hear that you tried to
illegally us for years and we're
going to make sure you pay for it I'm
totally in favor of that if you want to
call it Revenge that's just short hand
but there there there is a body of
people who have been very much trying to
jail and ruin people like
me and they did it for a political game
they they didn't do it for moral reasons
nothing like that it was for political
gain if somebody you for political
gain revenge is completely
appropriate completely yeah now it has
to be within the legal the legal
framework you know I'm not talking about
death
squads don't want that uh but within the
legal framework yes there should be
there should be held to pay for this the
the amount of paid that they've created
for their own personal gain is I mean
it's not Hamas level but it's whatever
is the uh lesser violent version of that
I would say it's violent because jailing
people on Trump tub charges is violence
would you agree putting people in jail
is
violence putting innocent people in jail
is
violence yeah talk to Derek
Chauvin yeah putting innocent people in
jail is violence there's no way around
that so all right so I did a little uh
poll in which I asked people uh would
they favor Trump becoming a dictator in
America how do you think that
went 78% of respondents said yeah yeah
we want Trump to be a
dictator you
idiots now I know you're joking all
right I I get I get that it's a joke I
get that you're trolling and I get that
the way people interpreted it was uh
you'd rather have a trump dictator than
a current version of a Biden dictator
because if you think Biden's already a
dictator because he's jailing his
political opponents and and stifling
Free Speech which is pretty much the
that's kind of the definition of a
dictator uh if so if you think Biden's a
dictator then the way you're answering
the question is you know i' take Trump
as a dictator over that but here's what
you should have done you should have had
zero response to yes we want a dictator
you know why right you just handed the
Democrats the win all they have to do is
publish my
poll even unscientific as it is it's
just a Twitter poll but as unscientific
as it is that's going to be a
headline
tomorrow do you know that right
somebody's going to publish that as part
of a story that says yes Republican
voters do want a
dictator you don't want a
dictator you were supposed to say no
because that's your actual opinion you
know I'm not not asking you to lie your
actual opinion is you don't want to
dictator if you had said that then it
would have really worked in your favor
because you could say look there's no
Republican there's not even one
Republican who wants a dictator even
their own person they don't want as a
dictator I I could not have made this
easier for you it should have been easy
oh that's their biggest their biggest
weapon is the belief that Republicans
would support a dictator and then you
 voted for it by 80 like uh
80% 80% of you thought it'd be funny to
say yeah we like a dictator that is the
worst practice iCal joke
ever you just gave away the
country the reason I published it is I
didn't really imagine anybody would be
dumb enough to say yes even as a joke I
I I couldn't process it so you're right
probably is my own damn fault but
somebody was going to ask the question
right if I didn't ask that question
somebody would have but it's going to be
taken as people being serious and then
it's a problem so if I could give you
any
advice you should be honest about that
question I mean if you really want a
dictator I'd like to know that so I
could oppose you because I don't want a
dictator but if you want to
win don't joke about that don't joke
about that if you want to win play the
win play the
win so that's my lesson for you today uh
and some of you are saying I was honest
I do want a trump dictator all
right if if you want to lose just keep
saying
that Free Speech well I don't think you
believe it
so but then we mock the media mocking
the media doesn't work because only your
own teams sees it the Democrats will
just see that a bunch of Republicans
want to conquer the country and have a
dictatorship yeah it's like the right it
it does almost feel like
Republicans are trying to lose sometimes
it does actually feel that way I don't
think they are but they they act in a
way that from the outside you
think I
know would Trump want to be king you
know here's the
thing anybody who had an opportunity to
be king would probably take it you know
except the Duke of whoever Duke of
Wellington I guess
um but it's not really an option and I
think Trump would far I think Trump's
best bet for his family and everything
else in his legacy is to just be a
really good president
by far that's what he could do for his
kids um that's what he could do for the
country just be a good president that's
all anybody
wants all right
um better dictator
Trump trump is a grandiose
narcissist
um your show buffers at 30 34 minutes
after an hour on almost every show oh
that's interesting I'll keep an eye on
that he has no clue how to be a good
president was it just luck the first
time all
right
um reum over breaking War
stuff they used to love him
yeah did he win already in my mind
no it's just seems like it's heading in
that
direction could crime be solved by
fixing the prison
system well not solved but you know
there's nothing you couldn't make better
75% on your poll it was several thousand
the the Twitter polls you don't really
need to give the number because I
wouldn't have told you to the number if
10 people responded but on a big account
I'll get I'll probably get 2 to 10,000
respondents well thank you
colon
uh repatriation
maybe all right did we hit all the big
stories I still say that uh Trump's best
play is to get the Democrats fully
invested in the dictator um narrative
and then uh humorously mock it out of
existence what you don't want to do is I
will not be a dictator
cuz you're talking like a
dictator so simply saying it's not true
or you won't do that doesn't work at all
but if you laugh at it and and you're
laughing at it with genuine Amusement it
would be hard for people not to feel
that right because when you mock
somebody and you laugh at them they kind
of feel it more than they feel just
political
talk so I think he could do and this is
the way I do it what exactly did he
think I was going to do on January
6 did you think the Army was going to uh
obey me and take over the
country yeah did it did I have any
contact with the military except to ask
for the uh the what was it the uh Coast
Guard or he asked for some kind of
forces to protect the capital that's the
only conversation he had with anybody
military here's what else you should say
I'd like you to talk to my
generals talk to the generals talk to
all of the
generals ask them which one I talked to
about conquering the country and ask
them which one of them would have gone
along with it if I said if I said oh
National Guard I'm sorry National Guard
not the Coast
Guard but don't you think that would
work you're Trump just
say talk to the generals do you think
there was you know do you think I was
trying to overthrow the country without
talking to the military how would that
even work talk to the Supreme Court ask
them how many would have backed me to
take over the country if the election
the way it was counted that I don't
agree with but the way it was counted
who would have backed it as ask why my
son which you can see in the emails that
happened at the time ask why my son
didn't know I had this plan to take over
the country has anybody even stopped to
think that there was wasn't any
mechanism in play nor had any been
contemplated other than publicly
protesting and and badgering the
government to try to take a closer look
at the the
process you you show me any any
mechanism that would have looked as if
we were trying to take over a country or
how that could have even
happened and the other thing that is
most interesting how many thing how many
people do you think it would take to be
on this the same team for anybody to
become a
dictator if you didn't do it militarily
and nobody's even suggested that was on
the table you couldn't do it by
persuasion there are just too many
people involved in anything so if you
said all right I'm the dictator now so
you people go do this dictator thing
there would be like half of them would
be
Democrats because the the permanent
bureaucracy is not all just his people
so the people who actually have to do
things would have to be on board with it
or nothing could happen and there's no
way that the Democrats who make up a big
portion of the government are going to
be on board so nothing would happen it
would just be too hard to get anything
done so no it couldn't happen there
there was no reasonable way that could
have
happened all right um it's happening
now all right that's all for today I'm
going to go do something else
uh maybe the locals platform will get
fixed tomorrow and I will talk to you
tomorrow bye for now
