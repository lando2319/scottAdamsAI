and welcome to
coffee with scott adams the highlight of
civilization
and today we're going to put the
positive spin on all the terrible things
does that mean we're bad people
well some of us are
frankly but
no not necessarily not necessarily
you could take a day off from the
tragedies
you can unless you're
personally involved but if you'd like to
just take a little mental oh let's say
uh floss
this would be the place to come and all
you need to kick it off right is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker chelsea
stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
the thing that's already giving you a
little bit of a tingle
admit it a little bit of a tingle
go
all right i have a provocative
thought what if the supreme court never
rules on roe versus wade after all
you know we saw the
we saw the leak
but we also know that the leak
could be in the form of a document that
was passed around to see if people would
support it or
you know what the best argument would
look like
but what if
what if
instead of just waiting for the right
time to release it because apparently
these big decisions
they wait for a certain time of the year
which is not now
so somebody can fact check me on this
but is it at the end of the session or
something
sometime in the summer is it august i
forget august october whatever it is so
there's a time when they do the
releasing of the big decisions and this
is not yet the time
so it could be that we haven't seen it
because it's just not the right time
on the other hand
what if they floated this thing just to
see what the public reaction would be
what if
oh somebody says june
no i think
really june
oh about june 30 at the end of june
somebody's saying okay well i'm sure
you're smarter than i am about supreme
court stuff
so let's say end of june
well let's say that that's right just
because i read it in a comment and
how could that be wrong
so
maybe
they floated it and they thought no it
will tear the country apart so let's
back off
do you think there's any chance
that that's going to happen
or that the decision is substantially
rewritten
i don't think that's going to happen but
do you think there's any chance any
chance that you just won't see it and
there'll never be an explanation why
very very low chance
very very low but not zero
not
zero it could actually happen
and it could be that the public opinion
is something they factor in now here's
why i think the supreme court should
factor in public opinion
because they're the last credible
institution and
and they're under assault
their credibility
if you lose the supreme court
your whole system is in
a lot of trouble right
so could could have a cascading effect
so i do think that the supreme court
would take the health of the republic
and the credibility of the court itself
as a higher priority
than the technical rightness of a
decision
what do you think
let me let me forget about this question
you know just forget about roe versus
wait for a moment
do you think in general this statement
holds
that the supreme court justices
would favor the integrity and
credibility of the court in the system
over any specific
ruling
i'd say yes
and can you think of anything that would
be more of a shock to the system
than the roe vs wade
um ruling
let's say
let's say that the majority court are
republican-leaning
or conservative
do you think that the justices who would
who would be presumably the ones
overruling it
do you think those justices
would be happy to have a democrat
elected president again or do you think
that they would prefer
getting a republican president
because think about think about the
human beings who have to
sign that thing on one hand it would be
you know
a feather in their cap i guess forever
something maybe they've always wanted to
do
they'd be at the center of history
there'd be lots of reasons to do it
from their perspective
but
there'd also be a good reason not to do
it
if they thought it was going to rip the
system apart
because as the justices have pointed out
the states will just make their own
rules anyway
so whatever happens is going to be at
least more localized it's not like the
biggest deal in the world
in some sense right it'll take a while
for state laws to
become whatever they were going to
become but they don't really have to
rule on this do they
they they could just punt
they could just kick that can down the
road forever
so
if i were to predict i will predict that
it'll be exactly what it looks like
i'll predict that there will be a ruling
and it looks just like the draft
but today is
uh
let's say good news day i know some of
you want it to be overturned but the
good news would be that it protects the
system
that's what i think
it protects the system so
you might argue that you'd rather uh put
the system at risk to save that many of
what you think are babies
that wouldn't be a ridiculous opinion
yeah the one thing about
the whole abortion debate
is that am i the only one i'm sure i'm
not
right i would imagine this is closer to
universal
that you have some respect for the other
side
would you say maybe far more than other
topics
i would say that's true no matter which
side you come down on you have to
respect the other side i i think in this
topic
you have to respect it
especially if they show their work i'll
tell you who i don't respect
someone who won't show their work
you know this is why i believe it
i know it has some costs
here are the benefits i prefer these
benefits to these costs
you know if you can say it outright
then i'm going to respect that opinion
even if i disagree with it but as i've
often said
i have a penis
for those of you who are not aware of
that
and
i don't think that my opinion on
abortion should be in any way persuasive
so it's better if i don't give it to you
just stay out of it and whatever women
want to decide
or the public in general who wants to
get involved i will back it
you know whatever gets decided i'm okay
with it
all right um because that means the
majority yeah i'm gonna go with the
majority on this one because when you
have a question that just can't be
settled
um
do i think the outrage was enough to
pressure a change that's a good question
i don't believe
that the risk of violence in the streets
would prompt the change
because i don't think there's that much
risk of that i mean there would be some
but it wouldn't be out of control
i think that the supreme court would
know that making this ruling would be
interfering in a presidential election
because it could change the result of
the presidential election
do you think they might wait until
after the presidential election
think about it now
somebody who's smart give me a
give me a historical
ruling on this
can the supreme court
or do they
as a
as a president do they take into
consideration that what they're doing
might affect how people vote
especially in a presidential election
do they take that into account
because i would i would think
that the supreme court would time any
decisions
to have the smallest impact on politics
which would suggest that they would make
this kind of a decision
right after an election cycle not right
before
a two-year cycle with both a
congressional race and a presidential
race
right
so events always change elections but
not something this big and not directly
coming from the supreme court i think i
think that might matter we'll see
so i went to watch top gun last night
how many of you have seen the movie top
gun
it's the first time i've been excited to
see a movie
in i don't know years
and so here's my review
totally delivered
it totally delivered
if you say to me scott there were many
cliches
in that movie i will say to you
yes there were
but
they did all the good ones
those are the ones you go to movies for
it's not that there are cliches
they all have cliches
it's just that some are good ones
like the you know the noble person who
sacrifices well that's a good cliche
i'll watch that all day long you know
the person who was uh afraid but then
they became brave i'll watch that all
day long yeah it makes me happy
i don't like it when somebody's tied to
a chair to be tortured
that's just bad writing
really you can't get through an entire
movie script without somebody tied to a
chair
like every other movie
top gun
nobody's tied to a chair and top gun
now
i think that tom cruise is the one who
gets the credit for the quality of his
movies he's obviously working with the
best producers and writers and
everything so you know his staff is you
know super talented
but i feel like he must be looking at
the script and saying you know take out
this tied to a chair apart
unless he has those
mission impossible maybe he has some of
those i don't know
but i feel like
because he's has so much control over
his movies he's the one who's getting
rid of the bad cliches and keeping the
good ones that are the reason you pay
for the movie in the first place
it was a good thing i would i would have
said half an hour shorter
it was a little too long
now i have to tell you this since i've
been uninterested in movies and i don't
really go to music festivals and stuff
like that
that this i think this is the first time
that i can remember
since the beginning of the pandemic and
even longer
that i was in a crowd
an unmasked crowd
and i didn't realize how long it had
been
and i have to admit
there was some part of me that thought
uh oh
am i going to get covered
from being in an unmasked crowd for the
first time in
two and a half years or whatever
it turns out i did not have to worry
about that
now the other people had to worry about
it because it turns out i have covert
but i didn't know that at the time
and so as i was watching the movie and
toward the end of the movie i was
thinking
why does my body hurt so much
why does every muscle in my body
hurt while i'm just sitting here
watching the movie
and then it started to grow it was like
i think my fingernails hurt
i don't have much hair but
what i have is hurting
why does everything hurt
and a little bit of a dry cough starting
to form
so i immediately went home and tested
and yep
i got the covet
so the irony is i did not have to worry
about catching covet at the movie
theater but the people next to me they
should be worried so
if you happen to be next to me
if you have to happen to be watching the
3 45 345 showing
in dublin
on the imax theater
and you're sort of toward the right and
the middle
now i
i feel really bad about this but the
people that sat you know directly to the
left
were masked
oh maybe you're saving them who knows
so let me tell you what last night was
like
because you're going to ask i did have
the initial to
the initial to vaccinations so i'm not
boosted
because i thought well i'll just get
that pfizer pill or whatever it is if
anything comes up
so i go home last night and i'm thinking
man i got to get me that pfizer pill
or whatever it is the one you get
and you know so first of all you're on
the phone for an hour to get your health
care provider
and then they say they'll book something
so i've got to have a
zoom call with a doctor after i'm done
with this
and
and then i'll get a prescription then i
don't know how to i'm going to get it
because i'm basically quarantined not
basically i'm quarantined
so
so this is giant pain in the ass now
wouldn't you think
that at this point
i should make a phone call and say
i just tested positive
and and some of that pfizer pill
would just show up on my doorstep
is there a reason there isn't somebody
literally driving that to my house
because i gotta wait 24 hours to get the
pill that you need to take right away
what
what
really i have to wait all that time
to get a pill that they're definitely
going to give me you know it's not like
they're going to say what you have this
certain condition you can't have this
pill
there's nothing like that right i mean i
don't have any weird conditions that
would fit into that
so i would say the system's kind of
broken
if it takes you a day to get the thing
that you need to get right away
now last night i would say that i was uh
the best phrase would be writhing in
pain
so if you're wondering what it's like to
get omicron
after you've had a couple of
vaccinations
writhing in pain for
i don't know 10 hours or so
um
my temperature was dysregulated so i had
the the chills so hard that it hurts
your muscles like you're chattering and
then you immediately sweat
and then you immediately go to chills
so i couldn't have a blanket on because
it'd be too hot
and i couldn't take it off because it
was too cold
and there are only two conditions black
and on blank it off so all that all
night long i would take it on take it
off take it off now
and i don't think i
slept more than a couple hours last
night
so it was a horrible horrible night
uh however
it turns out that uh four bonds and two
cups of coffee
largely cured
largely
you know i'm still quarantined so i'm
gonna take it easy but i feel fine
so
you know i'm not
um
i'm not exaggerating what i said i was
really sick last night
like i was really sick i you know
stomach head
throbbing everything
ah next day
i'm fine
so
that happened
gavin newsom has covered he's more
vaccinated than i am so maybe he'll do
better
or maybe not maybe not
all right here's some economic optimism
does anybody want some economic optimism
anybody
economic optimism number one
employment rates
still very good
and this will be the ultimate test
of the adams economic theory
that i'm naming at the moment that as
long as your employment rate is good
you can kind of figure out everything
else
you know it won't be comfortable
but you're not going to be
you know in desperate starvation streets
as long as everybody is working for the
most part and that's our current
condition
but we have unprecedented kinds of
you know inflation and
supply chain problems and maybe nuclear
wars energy shocks and you name it
there is reason to be optimistic today
number one the
shanghai china lockdowns they're
starting to ease them
which is good news if they ease them
more than china gets back online so that
that puts the
supply chain at least that part of the
supply chain a little bit stronger basis
um
there seems to be a slowdown in the
housing market
for the purchase of new homes which
apparently is what the fed wanted so
they raised interest rates to slow down
that market and doesn't get too head too
far ahead of itself too bubbly it's
pretty bubbly
so that's good news i mean it sounds on
paper if you don't study economics on
paper that sounds like bad news it's
like wait the value of my house will be
less or something
but
in the current situation you don't want
any big bubbles
right you want things to be predictable
so it's better that the housing market
cools off that's all positive
very positive
so now we've got the supply chains which
haven't starved us yet seem to be
kicking into place now there is
there is we get warning noises about
uh beef might have less beef
etc
but don't you think that the alternative
protein markets are going nuts right now
if you're in the business of making any
kind of alternative protein
i'll bet you're doing okay
so i think there's going to be a whole
resurgence in how we eat
the whole thing has it ever bugged you
how many times
food has to change hands before it goes
into your mouth
like you get that the farmer has to grow
it right
but then it you know gets washed and
puts in containers and it's shipped and
it puts on a shelf and then you take it
off the shelf and you put it in a cart
you take it out of your cart you put it
on a conveyor you take it out of the
conveyor you put in a bag you put it in
the bag you put it in your thing you
take your thing you put it in the car
you create the car but now you put it on
the counter take it out of the bag put
it in the
and then then you got to take it out of
the container when you eat it that is
all
that
that is also inefficient
something tells me that we're going to
figure out how to make food local
maybe 3d printers
maybe
yeah maybe everybody will just get a big
pile of protein and carbs and put it in
their printer and have a perfect meal
every time maybe who knows now you might
say to yourself scott's got scott
i will never eat a food that comes out
of a printer
to which i say
how's that different than soup
it's no different than soup it's just a
bunch of stuff put in a bowl that tastes
good so just put it in a printer and it
just spits out the food a different way
so yes you can you can make
a 3d printed food
extraordinarily
tasty
so
that's the good news
are you
are you thinking what i'm thinking that
the supply chain is getting solved we
just don't know about it
or is it getting worse and worse and
there's going to be some gigantic
catastrophe because i feel like the news
likes to report
impending disasters
so i've got a feeling that reporters are
looking into the impending disasters and
not finding them
or
or
do they have some kind of orders from
the government to not report on it
because it would cause a run on certain
things and it's better if you didn't
know
don't you wonder why there's no
reporting on on the cataclysmic supply
chain effects that are right ahead of us
because these should be
these alleged cataclysmic things should
be happening
over the summer maybe by the winter it's
pretty soon
so doesn't it make you think that we've
already figured out workarounds
or am i wrong
maybe we're just getting by with fewer
choices and it didn't really make much
difference at all just some companies
can't deliver their product but others
deliver more so you're fine
i don't know
so i've got a feeling that the supply
chain thing
maybe isn't that big a problem
you know in the end we'll see and not
that it isn't a big problem but that
we're so good at making adjustments
in a in a trillion different ways and
everywhere in the system i think we'll
just get past it
all right
does everybody like the optimism yet
so um
i've been talking about these small
homes that you can put up for thirty
forty thousand dollars you know a little
home that's got a bathroom and a kitchen
and a bedroom and you could just ship it
to the site and assemble it
well one of them is called boxable and
uh dave rubin
was informing me by tweet today that
elon musk has an investment in boxable
so he's one of the investors so even
elon musk is in this
this growing field
of the
homes that you can just slap together
from kits basically
so you know i've been telling you that
this is this is going to be the big
thing
they won't look exactly like these
version 1.0 you know in the same way
that your automobile today does not look
like a model t
but
but when you see how popular these are
poorly made now when i say poorly made
i only mean compared to what what they
will will evolve to
they're not poorly made for you know
today's technology and stuff but what
they will evolve too will be amazing
they'll be way better than what you're
living in now
if i haven't mentioned this before
there's a
planned community a neighborhood that's
built to be free from
cars so you can walk everywhere so if
they design it so that all the stuff you
need is in walking distance and they
have like
i guess electric scooters and electric
bikes and stuff you can you can just
grab and go
free public transportation
um
so it's cul-de-sac tempe tempe arizona
and the the organization is called
cul-de-sac.com
so they're actually designing
communities to make them more livable
car free
but is that enough
i mean that's i love the fact that it's
a car free community sort of like
college that was kind of a car free
community
but
i feel like that's just one variable
like what about making us less lonely
what about making us safer i mean it
might do those too but they don't talk
about that stuff because those are all
the things that make you know what about
being cheaper
you know what about being affordable
what about being you know more green it
sounds like it's pretty green so we'll
give them that
anyway i think these are the big trends
um
on axios
writer erica pandy
tells us that one in three americans
adults don't get enough sleep
and enough sleep is defined as seven or
more hours a night
is there anybody who gets more than
seven hours a night of sleep
in the comments how many of you get
seven or more hours per night
wow
wow
a lot of you do
i'll be darned i don't even know it was
possible
i mean
like
by the time you wake up at 7 00 am
you know i've already worked on two
careers
so i don't know what you guys you're
missing a lot
but on the other hand
apparently you will live longer than i
will
and you'll be happier and healthier
so good for you so keep up that sleep
um but apparently americans are getting
less and less here was a tip that i've
seen before but this is so useful
i thought i'd share it with you
here's a simple tip to improve your
sleeping that's one interesting
characteristic
well two
it's super easy to do and number two
you're not gonna do it
you're not gonna do it neither am i
here's that good advice
stop looking at your screens 30 minutes
before you try to go to sleep
really you think i'm gonna not look at
my phone 30 minutes before i get hit the
bed
what kind of
little house on the prairie world do you
live in that you can go more than 30
minutes without looking at a screen
a book
get away from me with your paper books
yeah
i guess listening to music's okay but
the way i do it i usually have to look
at a screen to select the music
so
there's your tip of the day turn off
your screens now you won't do it
let me ask you this
are mass shootings a big problem or a
small problem
here's here's why i ask
the news business
needs to put
faces and names on stories
because you wouldn't you would not read
a story about a concept
you would only read a story about oh
this farmer
you know lost their farm because of this
or this person was the victim of this
that
so the news
needs to
put names and faces on stories
and what what is the predictable effect
of having to put names and faces on all
your stories
well the predictable effect
is that the more easily you can put a
sympathetic
name on it the more attention it will
get
what what would
you know what wouldn't you know excite
our senses in the worst possible way
uh more than
murder of children
nothing right that's like that's it
that's that's the highest one
so given that you know they will have
names and faces which is already
happening
um it's inevitable
that we would look at things with names
and faces as the important things
but are they
now let me be clear
if you or somebody you knew were a
victim of some tragedy this one or any
other that's the most important thing in
your world for sure but
but
the world is full of tragedies
do we not get to rank them
so that we know which ones we should
focus on because right now the news is
ranking them by how easily you can put a
face on it
that's it
the stories you see are based on how
easily you can put a face on it
do you know how many times um given that
i'm in this business
do you know how many times i've uh
been asked to put a face on something or
a name
it's just the most common thing that
people in this business ask for okay but
i need a face in the name to make this
story
so
if there are
a whole bunch of victims
in the story there's going to be lots of
faces and names
but if you were to measure the size of
this problem
gun gun murders
versus the size of our other problems
where would it be
now remember
20 kids
if you were to multiply it by the number
of you know years each of them has left
left on average
that's robbing the most
human spark i guess
so that would be worse than you know 20
senior citizens in terms of number of
you know living years that were lost
so
it makes sense that you know anything
with kids is a tragedy
nothing affects us more emotionally
but
i'm trying to put it in context and i'm
not sure i can
because as much as i value you know i
like to think i can rationalize things
and try to take my emotion out of it i
don't know if i can
because
how do you rank like
death of children
compared to anything i mean it's just
always going to be worse even if it's
just one
it just will feel that way so be
be aware that you are being let's say
unknowingly manipulated
to care most about topics of the most
faces
and once you realize that
you can say to yourself okay is this
something to really
we need to get on this and change it
or is it not that big of a deal i don't
know it'll help you figure that out
and i don't really know i
uh
so if you look at even the stories on
gun control they've got to put ted
cruz's name on it right his name and
face got to put trump's name and face on
it so everything's got to be a name in
the face
um i was challenged
yesterday well actually a number of
times for not knowing enough about klaus
schwab
of the world economic forum in davos
and so i said to myself well i i've got
some idea what he's about
but i'll go to wikipedia
and see if there's anything
like
big that i'm not aware of
and
i have to think that when somebody else
is being described
that the third party doesn't always do a
good job
but
if the way he's being described in
wikipedia is accurate in terms of his
ideas
that would be interesting let me we'll
tell you what it is in a minute
uh
so
he argues that governments are no longer
the overwhelmingly dominant actors on
the world stage
and that quote the time has come for a
new stakeholder paradigm of
international governance okay
so he's for some new way
that
the governments will operate
and it's something beyond governance so
there'd be governments plus something
else i guess you'll describe it here
and he says the time has come for a new
stakeholder paradigm of international
governance so international meaning
across borders
so there'd be some kind of governing
entity
that wouldn't be limited to your country
red alert red alert all right
and then the
vision includes a public private un
in which certain specialized units would
operate under joint
and non-state
governance systems
so in other words the private enterprise
would be
part of government so you say yourself
wait a minute what what what part of
private enterprise like a company
should be making government decisions
like how do you decide
what company you trust enough to make
decisions like a government
and he has an answer to that here's how
you choose them
they would be self-selected
[Laughter]
what
what
a self-selected coalition of
multinational corporations
and governments through the un system
and they would select a civil society
organization so basically he's saying
that uh big companies they would
self-select they would have to volunteer
to be this
uh would work with
the governments
such as they are which would be weakened
across
across country lines
to create some kind of separate
organizations
that run everything
and
according to this wikipedia article
which i can't believe is true
i can't believe this is true
honestly it looks like something is left
out doesn't it
yeah
i think there's something like
majorly left out of the story
because i can't believe anybody would
say with a straight face
that we want to get rid of the
democratic systems and replace them with
private corporations
multinational corporations so not not
just
corporations in one country but
multinational corporations
that would self-select
so they decide they wanted to be in
charge and then they'd put themselves in
charge
how in the world
could that be serious
how in the world could that be serious
what am i missing
is there a whole part of the story that
they just don't mention here on
wikipedia
because this doesn't even look a little
bit like it's going to happen
why would you even worry about this
is it because a lot of people go to
davos so therefore it looks like it
might actually happen
i don't see any uh i don't say the
scenario in which the united states
gives up control to corporations that
self-select they want to be in control
i
you're saying is serious
i've got a real question about it
i feel as if there's something more to
the explanation
that if you heard it would not sound so
bad crazy
because remember klaus schwab
is
he's not only an engineer he's an
economist
so do you think somebody who's an
engineer and an economist
would come up with an idea that's so
obviously bad
i feel like there's something left out
unless it really is just totally crazy
talk
maybe
aoc is not an economist i wouldn't say
that
she just studied economics well maybe
okay if you want to say somebody who
studied economics as an economist
all right his father was a full-blown
nazi somebody says
yeah you know i'm not i'm not gonna
judge any
uh
germans by what their parents did in
world war ii is that fair
but let's
yeah can we can we let go of that
if somebody's parents did something in
world war ii
i'm gonna let go of that
it's time time to let go
all right
what else is going on
um and there's uh some hoax updates
so this one not only i think even the
hoax update might be a hoax i don't know
but there's some lesser publication
lesser known publication i don't know if
they're lesser quality but they're a
lesser known publication
saying that fbi documents reveal the us
may have funded charlottesville riders
through ukrainian neo-nazi groups
documents show the ties between the azov
battalion and the u.s rioters
now i don't doubt that there's some
connection
between peoples
but i've got a feeling that nobody
i don't think the fbi or anybody was
knowingly
funding that but i ask you this
provocative question
where are they now
where are all those people who marched
without masks
in the age of facial recognition
all those people marched without masks
and we never really hear from them do we
i feel i feel like
you would expect that the news would
have
you know found a few a few few years
later and say you participated in that
march how do you feel about it
but
i don't think you can find them
i don't think you can find them
i'm not so sure
they were all totally organic i mean i'm
not denying the existence of people just
like that in the united states but the
events specifically might had
might had a little bit of theater
involved that we don't know about
not to say that we're not real racists
there clearly they were which we disavow
um
a few more hoax updates there was a
rupaur edit of biden snubbing modi
you know india's prime minister modi but
apparently that's just a
misleading edit
so if you see a video that looks like
biden is snubbing moti
that didn't happen
uh here's another one
let's see oh there's two fake stories so
cnn is debunking fake stories about
ted cruz and governor abbott of texas
that feels like something
because i feel like they would have just
ignored it before
but fairly prominently
they debunked
two claims against cruz and abbott
and so it doesn't matter what they are i
think they're just
well
it matters
one is uh alleges to show that ted cruz
always says the same thing after every
mass shooting
but that's fake
so simply just you know fake some tweets
uh and the other one
showing uh abbott
did something bad that didn't really
happen
now
here's some more good news
um it turns out that if the russians
have to compete with the iranians to
sell illegal oil
because there are sanctions on iran and
russia
this is really bad news for iran
so iran at least had an ability to sell
to sketchy markets you know they could
sell to china but they could sell to you
know sketchier countries
but as soon as russia can only also sell
to those same sketchy countries
including china
it makes the price of iranian oil go way
down
because apparently the iranian oil is
just crap compared to the russian oil if
you had a choice you want the russian
oil it's easier to refine so
apparently the
iranian
revenue from oil is down like 25 already
since the sanctions on russia
and iran was not that
doing that well
so there's actually a thought
that weirdly
the war in ukraine
might lead to a tightening of the
economic
woes in iran which would lead them to be
flexible to negotiate something with a
nuclear deal that made sense
so maybe
maybe
the war in ukraine
is going to cause
iran to make a peace deal
in the middle east
maybe
could happen
so that
is the good news for the day
yeah and of course china wins because
they're getting
cheap oil
all right
did i leave anything out
um somebody just got here so i'd like to
repeat
uh blah
that's all you missed not much
oh your gas is up to 549 a gallon in
chicago oh boohoo
it's over seven dollars here i pay seven
dollars for a gallon of gas
all right
um
oh iran is moving closer to russia
i choose to live in california you know
strangely enough i'm not sure i did
choose
um
at least pleasanton chose me
long story there
all right
voting for schillenberger
um
holy 875 a gallon of vancouver but
that's that's canadian money
which is pretty close right canadian
dollar us dollar kind of close at the
moment
414 where do you live
all right
uh by crypto not gas you say
electric bikes
are going to be everywhere
all right well i'm going to go
get ready to uh
talk to my doctor and
get some covered pills and
i will uh
be back
in the real world in
nine and a half
days so
i might do some extra uh live streams
because i'll be locked in
so i might need some like social outlet
so that's on you
you're gonna have to put up with me a
little bit extra i think
all right but the good news is
if that's the worst that omicron has to
to throw at me it was a really really
bad night but at the moment zero pain
no discomfort at all
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
