over to do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
it gets better every time and I know
that seems impossible but it does it's
physics
and if you'd like to take this up to the
next level
to be one of the first who has ever
achieved this level of Awesomeness
well all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tanker jealous was dying a
kimteen jungle flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being here today thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip but it happens now
is there any way I could do the
simultaneous sip
um in a wrap
what would it sound like in rap
a cup or mug or a glass is that good no
can't do it can't do it
apparently I do not have the hip-hop
Gene
I am
Soul free all right
let's put that away
we have so much news
so there's more on the Twitter files and
Matt taibi
um you summarized it this way on Tucker
Carlson show you said that uh
that Twitter took suggestions from a
wide variety of government entities on
who to who to ban and who to uh
will basically would have been
now
is that a censorship
apparently it wasn't just the federal
government it was like all kinds of
agencies
they all had access to Twitter one way
or another and they all had given them
lists not all of them but you know many
different agencies including local
police
probably CIA mataibi speculates
um
now now here's the context lots of
different entities suggested
censorship for certain accounts
but did any of them demand it and does
that matter
my understanding is that nobody demanded
that because there was no law that
required it and also that Twitter was in
some cases accepting very little
of a large list so they might have you
know they might have had a large list
please ban these people or look into
them and Twitter would look into them
and say well a few of these maybe but
mostly not
is that censorship
to me it just looks like a really bad
system
yeah to me it looks like a bad system it
looks like something that transparency
could fix
and if transparency could fix it I don't
know if it's censorship
because here's what I'd like to know
I'd like to know what did the government
ask
and who did they ask it about
if I only knew that
and then I saw what Twitter actually did
and then if I saw the Twitter
held to their standards if Twitter just
held to their own standards but the
government was asking there for for
bands but we could see them
it's just transparent they say why they
want a band
and then Twitter looks into it and makes
a decision would that be would that be
censorship
or would that just be your government uh
helping private Enterprise do what
private Enterprise wanted to do anyway
because remember if if all they do in my
hypothetical this this is not what
happened so I'm not claiming this is
what happened
I'm saying in a hypothetical
if it were all transparent and if
Twitter only only stayed to its own
rules
I don't know
I'm not entirely positive I'd have a
problem with that
I understand the argument
and I don't disagree with it right I
don't disagree I don't disagree at all
if you define that as censorship it's
pretty close
would you all agree it's sort of in the
neighborhood so if you want to call that
censorship I'll give you that I will
stipulate that
but would it bother you
would it bother you
if it were all transparent
it would
now you realize that Twitter takes uh it
takes recommendations from everybody
does it
'll take recognition from you won't it
might ignore it but now it could be that
because the government has more uh let's
say power
the more organized they have a whole
system for doing it
certainly the government would have more
impact than any individual
so that's all censorshipy I'm not sure
that I care that much though
I'm not sure that I care
because
the the public is not powerless they are
just sometimes information free
when you arm the public with actual
information that's reliable that's the
problem less times our information is
bad but if the government if the people
had actual good information
they pretty much always get what they
want
it's it's the information problem that's
the problem
yeah I don't know uh I think I can agree
with you totally
if you say uh it's too close to
government censorship so don't take a
chance
that feels reasonable
do you accept that do you accept that
opinion
it's a gray area but you don't want a
gray area how about that
it's a little bit of a gray area but I
would say how about no gray areas
everybody okay no gray areas when it
comes to free speech just get rid of all
the gray yeah that seems like a good
standard doesn't it
so we'll see if that happens
but at the other hand the government
also has freedom of speech too don't
they
don't all the people in the government
and
I guess it's just the people right but
the people in the government have
freedom of speech
so what would stop them from exercising
it and talking to Twitter
yeah nothing
so basically if Twitter doesn't stop it
or do something it'll just keep
happening right
hmm all right let's talk about the uh
speaker of the house and McCarthy's
fighting to get those last votes if he
can and uh ex-president Trump as
endorsed McCarthy and Matt Gates and his
band of Rogues is trying to stop it
and so you know all that's happening and
there's still that a deadlock here's my
opinion on that I don't care who is
speaker of the house because so far no
nobody has a plan for Fentanyl or for
Banning tick tock
and without that I don't really care who
does it it's all just moving chairs if
you're not going to do the work
so
I made I made my point a little bit more
provocatively
a little bit more provocatively on
Twitter and I said this if Matt Gates
the one who's holding you know one of
the ones who's holding up the whole
business or if Matt Gates comes up with
a reasonable looking
fentanyl plan
and a tick tock band
I would back him for a Speaker of the
House
I bet you didn't see that coming
yeah that's all it would take that's all
it would take now do you have any other
problems with Matt Gates probably
but I wouldn't care
all right because in this hypothetical
situation he'd be the only one doing the
work
so if one of them wants to work I would
consider rewarding them with the
speakership it obviously has nothing to
do with me
but
but if any of them does the work I say
maybe we should consider the person who
actually works
as their leader not the ones who are
doing what I don't know collecting money
doing speeches do some work
take you know put yourself out there now
that's also what I like about Matt Gates
lately
so Matt Gates was pushed into a nothing
to lose situation you know by all the
allegations he had to fight recently and
also by the fact that he was so close to
Trump and Trump had a bad January 6. so
a bad case is basically you know the
the the up-and-comer who got totally
smacked down nothing to lose nothing to
lose
so when you have nothing to lose it
really frees you up to do the things
that need to be done that other people
wouldn't risk
so if somebody could come up with a
fentanyl plan in a tick tock band plan
it would be somebody like him
somebody who didn't have anything to
lose and was willing to you know take a
take more of a long shot approach to
things
who is Ben Garrison it sounds like
sticks and Hammer was talking about uh
idiot Ben Garrison
so Ben Garrison is a low IQ
um low low character kind of a person
who also draw across cartoons
so he's he's I can't tell if he's dumb
or just low character but it's one of
those things one of those things
anyway
um
so we don't care about that anyway uh I
was listening to a Twitter spaces
conversation uh by Mario narwhal is that
his name and I gotta I gotta recommend
it it is so entertaining I didn't think
the spaces thing
would actually be anything I would ever
spend much time with because I've
sampled lots of them and they're usually
just
the usual dumb people talking instead of
tweeting
and I just don't need that like taking
people who are already not saying
anything useful on tweets and then
allowing them to speak in an audio
setting doesn't really upgrade my my
situation but what did is uh Mario
apparently has organized
you know a let's say a sort of a
business within the technology that's
really entertaining like I couldn't I
couldn't stop listening I had other
things to do and I just couldn't stop it
was just too interesting but he was
talking about uh
uh
yeah he was talking about
um the entertain situation
So I listened to this conversation for I
don't know maybe an hour or so and
there's one really big thing
context-wise
there's there's one really uh big thing
that I tried to raise my hand to be a
speaker but there were too many speakers
or or they weren't interested I don't
know but I didn't get to add my contacts
so if there's anybody there who ends up
being the speaker at some point here's a
context that you need to know about the
Romanian
Andrew Tate accusations
for famous people only and he would be a
famous person for famous people only
stories like this and I'll say like this
where there's accusations and complexity
and it's a fog of War right so for
situations like this what percentage of
the total things you hear are true
and in the proper context
what would you say what's your
experience tell you
of all the things you've heard what
percent is true
yeah 25 is my guess yeah 20 25 that's
right
and so it was a very long
um conversation
with very smart well-informed people
who I thought was failed in a really big
way because they didn't acknowledge
or maybe often enough
that the the quality of the information
is closer to 80 wrong than 80 percent
right and I think these sort of common
this is me doing mind reading but I feel
as if the
common feeling of the participants is
that there would be some surprises you
know maybe 20 percent
but that eighty percent of the stuff
they they had a bead on for example they
know
that the prosecutors are holding Andrew
Tate for the purpose of looking into the
allegations
do you think that's true
it's the most basic part of the story
that the authorities are dictating
Andrew Tate while they're looking for
the crime
I'm not even sure that's true
it might be I mean I'm not ruling it out
but I would say I wouldn't even put
credibility in that the most basic part
of the story
because you know what the other
possibilities are
the other possibility is he's being held
for his protection
it could be that a member of the mafia
dropped the dime on him
right because it could be
that you know the mafia
you know was after him and maybe his
friends picked him up because he'd
bragged at one point that he was bribing
the local police
if the local police knew the mafia was
after him
they might stage an intervention to
protect him he could easily be in police
protective custody and they're all on
the take
now I'm not saying that's the case
there's there's no evidence of that
right I'm just saying that in a case
like this
the the reality is going to be so far
from whatever it is you think you know
now
it won't be recognizable
it won't even be recognizable
now
one of the other uh debates
that I heard online is somebody said
that most of what we know about Andrew
Tate's alleged crimes
are things that he admitted himself on
video
he admitted them clearly and then there
was somebody else who said I talked to
him personally and he admitted these
things to me personally he said this to
me in person
is that persuasive
is it persuasive that somebody quite
believable
says he told me in person and now I'm
telling you
and then
yeah and and then what about the stuff
he said in public because we all heard
that we don't have to wonder if he said
it's on video
what about that is that persuasive
not even a little not even a little
because the videos you can pretty much
count on being out of context right do
you think any of those videos are in
context
of course not
the the thing that's happening to Andrew
Tate is happening to me on Twitter every
day every day literally just a moment
ago I had to correct some person who had
one of my tweets out of context that's
all it is it's just out of context stuff
so there's nothing you know about the
state situation
you don't know anything about it nothing
and that's the way you should treat it
you know could it turn out that it's
largely like it was reported maybe but
the odds are low
odds are pretty low
all the clot trolls are over here
I'm going to let the clutch rolls go
because you all just look like idiots at
this point
uh cognitive dissonance examples
dingleberries
flying around my ass that sort of thing
so go nuts today the the clutters
the the
clock idiots Club idiots make yourself
known all right
so of course this will be interpreted as
me supporting Andrew Tate
uh which is not happening because I
think he's a bad person
just based on my own personal
interactions
so
my opinion is
I hate him
but it is also true that information
about anybody who is a celebrity is just
terrible you shouldn't believe any of it
all right but let me say that there's
you shouldn't put any credibility in
anything you said in public
he's literally somebody
who uses hyperbole in public
for benefit you don't think he uses
hyperbole in private
do you think he only exaggerates in
public
maybe but I've got a feeling he that he
brags and exaggerates to everybody in
private as well it feels like that would
be a reasonable assumption
so if you've got somebody
whose primary now correct me if I'm
wrong
I think all of the allegations a bit
about him
are based on
what he said himself which can't be
trusted at all
and while somebody said he said to
somebody which can't be trusted at all
I know
we'll see what happens
CNN announced that he has hired a new
a new member a new senior political
commentator
huh
who would be the worst possible Choice
let's say I'm a executive of CNN and I
want to make sure
that if any conservative accidentally
was switching through the channels and
saw this face I'd want to make sure that
they never wanted to watch my show again
who would that be who would it be to
guarantee that you never increased
the reach of your show because you had
insulted conservatives so badly with
your choice of people who would be good
for that
well they announced that their new CNN
senior political commentator will be
Adam kinziger
Adam kinziger
no really I didn't make that up
no I swear I didn't make it up that's
real
that's an actual real thing that's
happening
now correct me if I'm wrong
he might be good for their base you know
the the Democrats who like to watch CNN
but do they have no interest whatsoever
in attracting a republican for a few
minutes
like no interest at all
uh or or let me ask you this do you
think CNN doesn't really know what they
just did
because that's possible isn't it
it's very possible that CNN has no idea
how bad this is I I can't think of
anything worse
it absolutely ends their chance of
having a republican viewer
am I wrong
I feel like maybe they just didn't know
because it's a little off-brand at the
moment because they've had a good run
under their new leadership
of I think and I give them quite a lot
of credit I think they've pivoted closer
to the middle
not all the way baby but but the
movement is worthy of applause
but this is just such a bad decision
yeah maybe I'm wrong maybe he's exactly
what makes you watch because you want to
see how horrible it is I don't know
but if you're gonna if you're gonna get
somebody from the Republican side don't
get the one who is hated by Republicans
shouldn't you get at least one person
that a republican would say oh
flipping through the channels let's see
what this one says
just one you can't get one Republican
that they would actually want to watch
all right how many of you are up to date
on the Dana White
situation president of the UFC
so he was in Mexico with his wife
partying at some nightclub and he's
caught on video camera video
it looked like he and his wife were both
drunk
and they had some conversation which
generated her slapping him in the face
quite hard
and him slapping back at which point
they were broken up now how does the
news cover a story about two drunk
married people
who the woman slaps the man first is
very clear
and then he slaps her back in return
immediately not with his full power you
could tell he's holding back obviously
and then afterwards
both the husband and wife
announced that they've apologized to
each other they've apologized to each
other
to each other right Mutual
and they're both okay with it they've
been married 26 years alcohol was
involved they're both sorry about it
is there anything else
that the rest of us need to care about
is there anything else that we should
care about
I love this one
I don't think so
this to me this looks like a totally
private situation
but
we have to talk about how the media
covered it right so I say let them alone
just let them alone
that's their business
but the way we all are treating it
that's the separate story so let's talk
about that
um
here's how Ian miles Chung tweeted about
the story see if you think this
um
sums it up Dana White has owned up to
this
and apologized for slapping his wife and
says he knows he effed up
to you decide if he should be forgiven
but there's still some folks out there
defending it
what come on man some people will do
anything to defend disgusting Behavior
that does
oh are you agreeing with that
some of you agreeing with that take
do you see anything missing
where's the missing part where she
apologized for slapping him
because that's also in the news
all right
um
wow
how did TMZ headline it
now this might surprise you
but I have a ton of respect for TMZ have
I ever told you that there was once a
nasty rumor about me on the internet and
it made the press and the Press was
reporting the rumor as if we're true and
of course it wasn't right only one press
entity contacted me to ask is the rumor
true only one
TMZ
TMZ is the only one who fact checked it
with me and then I explained the context
and then TMZ said this
oh okay no story
because there actually was no story it
was just made up
only TMZ fact Jack did and for the rest
of my life
I will defend TMZ
until they do something different right
if they do something you know horrible
but until that day I want every single
person to know that privately without
bragging to you
privately they acted like
exactly how you'd want them to act so
you know Harvey
RV 11 am I saying his name right
congratulations you've created a an
ethical
an ethical group or at least the person
I talked to a producer
so good for you I I appreciate that and
I respect it
here's how TMZ handled this story this
is their headline nightclub fight with
wife on New Year's Eve
how's that
nightclub fight with wife that's a
little closer to what happened isn't it
I'm not sure it was a fight fight
I would have said uh they slapped each
other Maybe
you know wife slaps him he slaps back I
think the accurate way to say it is
uh drunken wife slaps him drunk and
husband slaps back neither hurt
I think that would be the way to
characterize it
um
all right
um I'm I'm by the way on the locals
platform you can't tell but my my plan
is totally working over here on YouTube
I I have all the clock people and Ben
Garrison supporters they're going nuts
trying to interrupt the program but
you idiots don't know you're all part of
my plan
so the more energy you bring me and the
more times you mention the idiot Ben
Garrison that's what I want
yeah I want you to be saying Claude
Adams and Ben Garrison
and why you say it often because you're
part of my lawsuit now
because the lawsuit
needs to show that there's damage
and so this is helping me so the more
you
the more you say cloud Adams the more of
it I can demonstrate
so keep going
you're you're working for me now
all right here's uh something that
Tweeter Hyde Von zarovich said
just somebody on Twitter who said
something I think is noteworthy and he
talked about the uh Dana White thing and
he said the laden Mis injury in other
words you know hatred of men the latent
misandry on display by the majority of
people weighing in on this is just
appalling
he says it's misery for holding data to
a unilateral obligation in other words
saying it's all his fault and it's
misogynistic because it treats his
wife's wife as if he lacks all agency
which is exactly how I see it it's
infantilizing the life
it's like she doesn't have any
responsibility for slapping somebody in
public
no no responsibility for starting a
fight
now let me tell you that
um you know their their situation is
theirs
but assuming that the reporting is true
because I think both
both Dana and his wife have the same
version which is
um they've both apologized to each other
does that sound good enough
this is something more there's something
missing there they both apologize to
each other
I feel like there's a little bit missing
because one of them is apologizing for
starting the fight
yeah I didn't see apologize for starting
the fight
that's what I want to say well again
it's not my it's not my marriage so I I
don't need or want anything out of it
right it's just their business and it
needs to stay their business but I would
I would just point out that I would
never respect anybody
who didn't apologize for starting the
fight I wouldn't respect that but it's
not mine to respect right it's theirs so
I'll let them work it out there was a
new study that says ugly people are more
likely to want to wear masks in public
are you surprised
the less attractive you are
the more happy you are to hide your face
well that's a surprise
now
do you see any problem with the study
right off the bat
without knowing anything else about the
study just that it seems to indicate
ugly people are more likely to mask
is there anything else about that
all right let me give you a few little
problems number one
do you think ugly people and attractive
people have the same IQ
nope
I doubt it I doubt it for the simple
reason that smart people don't need to
develop their minds there's not really
much benefit to it and ugly people like
me
like at the age of like five I looked in
the mirror and I said
I'm not going to focus on my athletic
ability
true story
yeah I've told you that I I planned 60
years in advance that's not a joke
at age five I looked in the mirror and I
said all right basketball is not your
future you better work on the schooling
stuff you better you better develop a
set of skills because you're not going
to get by in your looks I totally did
that
so you don't think that made a
difference in my academic performance of
course it did I knew it was survival
for me academics was survival I didn't
have a fallback plan so
I would imagine now now you're probably
thinking ahead and that's no fair I'm
not saying that how smart you are
determines whether you wear a mask I'm
saying that if you haven't controlled
for that there's a gigantic variable
that's not controlled in the study
now how about another one I thought you
didn't see this one coming
do you think that ugly people and
attractive people are generally speaking
are about equally healthy
overall comorbidities
people who are unattractive versus
people who are attractive who has more
comorbidities
of course it's ugly people of course it
is
of course this you know and the reason
that people are attractive
is because they're symmetrical and they
give off a healthy Vibe it's the
healthiness
this link to the attractiveness that's
hard to you can't separate them you know
nobody looks hot when they're in their
Deathbed
so you should assume that the people who
know they have less Health are more
likely to say well I don't know if masks
work or not but I'm going to do whatever
I can because I'm vulnerable
yeah
and I'd like to thank my mascots
the clotters
so the clotters
if you have any kind of an organization
that could promote
I'd like to give you some attention you
should organize into more of a formal
organization and I could retweet you you
should start you should start your own
website
maybe get a Twitter account
because I think the clotters are going
to be my
um
they'll be my uh my little army my claw
Army
the copers
I'll call them the copers
what do you what do you like better the
copers or the clotters for my fan my fan
base here
clutters or copers
claw clutter as it is
all right so it is now official
my fan base now this is this is well
known right
um aren't there
um like famous singers always have a
clever name for their groupies what's it
called like what is uh
Taylor Swift
there's a name for fans right are they
swifties or something
because somebody fact checked me on that
the Beavers yeah right the the Believers
the Believers
uh
the parrot heads right
the para heads
the claw army or the clotters you want
to go with claw army or clotters clay
heads
claw heads
how about clap toads no
uh claw tards you're liking but that
sounds
I don't think that's clot Birds Club
Birds Claw Clan
uh Club Birds
I think the club Birds I like that
because they should be Associated
closely with the cartoon that they think
is Garfield
the clock Birds
I think the club versus the best to own
don't you
okay I'm gonna the locals platform is
very clear on this uh you're now the
clock Birds and you are welcome to the
show and I hope that you're very active
because every clot bird on here is a
it's sort of a
that was sort of a
a way to honor me in a way a weird way
it shows my power and reach
and so I think showing my power and
reach through the number of Club Arts is
useful all right so the club birds are
going crazy on YouTube
Club pool
clock cats no clot Birds we're going to
go with clop Birds
that's what this is
all right
um
Adam dopamine on Twitter asked this
provocative question so you know we're
all talking about the myocarditis
increased risk for young men
you're all aware of that right there's
disagreement about what's behind it and
how bad it is and all that but we all
agree there's some kind of elevated risk
in the data for a young man and
myocarditis and Adam dopamine asked this
provocative question
imagine if myocarditis impacted 18 to 30
year old women
would it look the same
would the vaccinations still be
recommended for women if we knew that
women in particular
were having more bad outcomes than other
groups
nope not a chance
not a chance no this the the news is
full of evidence
that males are
just sort of uh not important
so the The Dana White situation is a
clear example that the women count and
the men don't
um now keep in mind he didn't hit his
wife hard not not that there's any
reason to hit anybody so I'm not
promoting hitting I'm just saying that's
part of the context there was two people
who were clearly not trying to hurt each
other
right so let me say that clearly it was
a fight
but it's two people when you see the
video it's pretty clear they weren't
trying to hurt each other it was sort of
you know wake each other up be
disrespectful or something but it didn't
look like they were trying to hurt each
other at all and you can tell right you
know the difference between somebody
trying to hurt somebody
again I'm not I'm not uh endorsing it
I'm just saying that's the context I
think this is true I think if women were
the ones having the bad outcomes
and I'm not sure that that's wrong
because the 18th to 30 year old women
would be the the only people who can
have babies right so from a biological
perspective they are in fact more
valuable
would you agree
from a social perspective
is better that we try to treat each
other with you know equal reverence from
a biological perspective young fertile
women are the most valuable humans
because they're the only ones who can
make more humans so it does make sense
that a risk to that group we would treat
is a higher risk that actually makes
sense
it's just it's just more evidence
of how we rank people right
all right here's another one
um
the trans question
you are aware that I have largely
ignored the trans question I talked a
little bit about the sports but that's
because I think sports are broken not
the trans
but I'm going to weigh into it I'm going
to weigh into it for the first time
and I'm talking specifically about the
kids not the adults just the kids and
about the kids transitioning
all right so I I haven't talked about
this before so you have no idea where
I'm going to go with this do you where
do you think I'm going to go with this
anticipate let's see if you know where
I'm going with this what will be my
opinion on children transitioning
all right well I'm going to go at it a
little bit sideways all right
first question I saw a tweet by dad
ragdi or something
um oh Keith Jordan I think is the name
of the person
and he said the rise of social media is
culpable
uh first Tumblr then Instagram then Tech
talk were all riddled with people
pushing the idea that one can quote
identify and of one's reality now of
course that's his opinion of what is
reality
and and then there's a Twitter thread
that goes into it
all right
who is to blame for kids transitioning
the children
social media
men
or women
go
children social media men or women
okay the the
oh what a difference between the two
platforms
all right I'll give you my opinion it's
all women
yeah this is a woman driven problem
entirely
entirely now not not to say that men are
on both sides of course they are men are
on both sides and women are on both
sides as well but the power of women is
very clear in this because if men had
full control of society it wouldn't be
happening
can you agree with this if men made all
the decisions and just ignored women
there this wouldn't even be an issue
this is entirely a woman generated
problem
right now when I say problem
I want to be very clear because here's
where I always get I always get accused
of fencing
but
probability is the only way to be smart
if you're sure of things you know and
everything's cut and dried and black and
white I'm not sure that's smart
in general doesn't matter what topic it
is
but here's the problem
there's kind of a parallel to gun
ownership
the children and and trans situation
very similar to gun ownership or the way
I treat gun ownership and it goes like
this
I guarantee you that some people are
better off individually
owning guns would you would you agree I
guarantee you somebody
somewhere is better off for owning a gun
they might protect their family is that
right guaranteed somebody now I don't
know what percentage that is now would
you also get guaranteed
having guns easily available is killing
people who didn't need to be killed just
because the availability and access and
you know somebody's kid gets into it
because a parent is irresponsible Etc so
you could say for sure
one thing I don't think anybody could
argue with they're individuals
individuals for whom gun ownership is
definitely better and individuals for
whom they're at greater risk would you
agree with that yeah now I think the
trans trans situation for the kids is
similar
I guarantee you that some of them are
worse off for reassignment surgery
while I also guarantee
somebody is glad they did it
and will grow up saying wow glad I did
that early that totally that totally fit
my mind and my body together and that
worked out for me
so
it's really tough to have in a strong
opinion of which way you should go
because you're choosing
how other people live their lives
you're you're saying that your
assessment of risk should be superior to
someone else's assessment of risk
so the way I solve it in the the gun
ownership is that
um you can't you just can't
serve everybody
you can't make everybody happy
so I I default to Freedom
if you cancel if you can't make
everybody safer
you default to Freedom and freedom is
it's in the Constitution you can own
your gun so that's where I come down on
it is clearly bad for some people it's
clearly good for some people
Freedom that's the tiebreaker
with the Trans if I were to apply that
same standard it gets really creepy
doesn't it which makes me question the
standard
so the standard is
I don't know which kids will be better
off
I also don't know the percentage I don't
know if ninety percent of them are worse
off
or ninety percent of them are better off
in the long run do you do any of you
know what percentage of kids would
always be happy that they did it and
what percentage would later regret it
does anybody know that I think that's
unknowable right
isn't it completely unknowable
in part it's unknowable because we've
never had this you know mass group of
children who even were making this
decision
so my usual default is if you can't tell
which way would hurt more children
default to Freedom
unfortunately
I default to Freedom and the freedom is
the parents and the kids and their
doctors
free country
it's a free country
now would I also be in favor of
educating
people better or you know making sure
that the the bar is higher so that you
don't make the decision until you've
really really exhausted all options yeah
I think that would be reasonable that
the the best
that would be reasonable I also think it
would be reasonable to put an age limit
on it
because there's almost nothing that we
don't put age limits on right
yeah and
um I have a real problem with parents
making the decisions
not because it isn't their right
because you need to give the parents the
right but because they're not qualified
I don't think many parents are qualified
to make that decision or even be part of
it they're not even qualified to
participate really because it's just
their feelings they're just going to be
working on their feelings and that's no
way to make that decision
so
definitely children need to be protected
better everybody agree
children need to be protected better in
a variety of ways this is not even the
only way but absolutely we need to do
better we're we're
I think we should be collectively
embarrassed
and shamed of how we've done as adults
we should be ashamed of how we've done
over the last several years ashamed
fentanyl is still pouring in Tick Tock
hasn't been banned and the kids are
changing their genders
we should be so ashamed that you know
the schools were closed
I mean we should be there's no apology
that can be big enough right we owe an
apology to this generation that is so
big
that no words could ever possibly handle
and if you don't think there will
someday be reparations
for this you're wrong
someday there will be reparations
for overly aggressive transgender
surgeries I'm not saying there should be
or that they should win that's all
different I'm just predicting
guaranteed there will be reparations
conversations in the future
10 years 20 years guaranteed because
this is so obviously a problem I don't
know what the solution is but so
obviously a problem made by adults and
the government I guess is the government
sort of allowing it to happen
yeah and lawsuits Etc
there's there's always reparations if
there's one category of humans that is
seemingly abused no matter what the good
intentions were at the time
thank you clock birds all the club birds
are really putting the energy in you
know I appreciate it because when you
think about all the things you could
spend time on today
you know you could be working
learning a skill
um you could be a good to your family
and friends you know working some kind
of Charity thing but I like the fact
that there's so many people who would
give up all of that they'd give up like
any benefit of the world
to be part of my fan group to be the
clubbers and that's the kind of
dedication
that yeah the the club Birds I think the
clock Birds need a motto
about we cope the hardest
how about that they need a motto it's
like a catchphrase Club Birds we cope
the hardest
yeah
how about that
clock Birds we cope the hardest
I think that's a good catchphrase
because you're coping really hard today
good coping
all right I made this statement
yesterday that got the fewest retweets I
think I've seen in a long time
is because nobody likes it
all right here's my opinion that nobody
likes
all politics is just fear
Boop
if you were on the other side of
politics from somebody it's because you
fear different things
that's it it's the whole thing
so
uh I'm not one who says we should stop
using fossil fuels why do I say that
why do I why am I not like a maniac
about stopping those fossil fuels is it
because my good analytical abilities
is it because I've researched it better
and I know that you know you'd eat it
for a while no matter what
Maybe
Maybe
but could it be that I'm just not afraid
of climate change
could it be that I'm just not afraid of
the future because I think we'll figure
it out
do you think I really have a logical
rational reason or is it a coincidence
that I'm not afraid of it okay
how about
um
mandates and masking and further
vaccinations with what we know now right
so forget about the past for a moment
with what we know now
am I promoting mandates and masks
mandatory mass and mandatory
vaccinations I'm not
why am I not doing that
because I'm not afraid of the virus
that's it
if we're afraid of it I'd be like oh do
everything
now during the
during the initial phases when the the
images from China made it look like it
was a bio weapon because people were
allegedly dropping over we know it's
fake now but at the time we didn't know
was it reasonable to be afraid of the
thing you did you didn't know but it
looked like a bio weapon yes I would say
yes I would say yes being afraid of it
before you knew
based on the information you had that
looked really scary totally reasonable
okay totally reasonable
now once we learned more
was it reasonable to release on the fear
I think so or at least reduce it greatly
so a lot of people have been the the
club Birds the club birds like to argue
that my opinion should have been the
same
even as the most basic information
completely changed actually reversed
so the initial information said you know
get off the planet if you can we're all
going to die and then it didn't take
long a few months before we realized oh
it's actually the comorbidity problem
Etc
so uh right then I'm saying right here
this there's a Clapper who's doing a
hard cope he says I'm the master of
moving the goal posts and flip-flopping
so changing my opinion
as the data and information changed is
considered the greatest sin to the clot
Birds
the clappers are doing a hard cope
because somebody altered or modified
their opinion as the information changed
and if you want to if you want to see
something funny on locals just open a
second window and look at the clock
Birds they're all just go nuts
Club Birds
give us some entertainment go yeah I I'd
like you to say in public in front of
the others that's a bad idea to revise
your opinion when the information
changes go
projection
there it is projection
all right uh let me give you some more
examples of why all politics is what you
fear the people who are the purebreds
pure Bloods
what do the pure Bloods fear
do they fear the vaccination
or do they fear the virus
yeah the government slash vaccination
well they fear the vaccination
so
so I would say that the uh the the clot
Birds and the um the hard copers over
here they're all people who are deathly
afraid of the vaccination
now I got vaccinated after waiting as
long as I could to find out you know
what the risks were
but then I made the same decision that
Dr Robert Malone did which is okay I've
waited months and months most of the
side effects usually happened in the
first months
um there's there's still
there there were still the information
of course was still
the kloppers are going crazy now I'm
doing this intentionally by the way I'm
just seeing how much I can spin them up
now the club Birds no you promoted it
the collaborates think I promoted it
the clubbers think that I was on the
fence
I'm a caver
yeah
so I made the same decision as their
hero Dr Robert Malone and for the same
reasons in about the same time
same decision
now that makes the collabers go crazy as
they are
but
don't you think that the clot birds are
deathly afraid of the vaccination
I'm not saying they shouldn't be
I'm not saying not even saying they
shouldn't be but don't you think they're
deathly afraid they seem frightened to
death
all right
so that's my um
so that's my take mostly we rationalize
our fears and that's what politics is I
do think
um it's not it's not mind reading to say
we rationalize our fears because that's
the basic operating system of people if
I said you're rationalizing your fears
but I'm not
that would be batshit crazy
don't let me do that
right you get that if I said if I said
you were rationalizing your fears but
I'm using my rational thought and I'm
not rationalizing my fears you shouldn't
listen to me at all
ever again for anything no we all are we
all have the same operating system
everything's a rationalization
see the only reason you would disagree
with that statement is that you believe
sometimes we act rationally
and sometimes we don't right
that that's what most of you think
sometimes we're rational actually most
of the time and then every once in a
while we could get crazy it's a reverse
you are irrational nearly all the time
and so you just don't realize it and
again I don't be just you
I mean me uh let me explain that that
that's the hypnotist reframe it's in my
book that's upcoming as well the
hypnotist reframe is that you're not
rational ninety percent of time but
sometimes you're crazy everybody gets a
little crazy sometimes it's really the
reverse ninety percent of the time you
don't know why you do what you do it's
just a rationalization
ten percent of the time you're balancing
your checkbook
and that might make sense
you know it's a rational process but all
of your decisions about who you marry
where you live what job you take how you
feel about politics that's all
fear-based stuff
that we rationalize as doing deep
research
so that's that's the hypnotist reframe
uh the clot birds are saying I'm doing
mental gymnastics
or I am agreeing with the entire field
of Psychology by the way you know that
that agrees with the entire field of
psychology and science there's no
disagreement
what I just told you that we decide
first and then rationalize it
that's not Scott talking you know that
right you know that science
did you know that
so it'd be interesting to be pro-science
just think about this irony
the the science of psychology
and you know brain scans and everything
else they know for sure they know for
sure
the irrational brain doesn't activate
until after the decision that's been
proven for decades and every time they
try to repeat this the experiment they
prove it again
so the people who say you got to use
science
are just rationalizing their fear but
selling it to you like they're the The
Logical ones and you're not nothing like
that's happening there's nothing like
that happening all of the belief science
people are just afraid of something
and the and they don't believe science
are just afraid of something else
now
that will offend at least all of you it
usually offends everybody
but it should be an equal opportunity
offense because remember every bit of
this applies to me
all right you have to keep reminding
yourself of that to accept this
everything I say
is a flaw in me because it's a flaw in
all of our operating systems nobody's
exempt everybody thinks they are you
know you think you're exempt we're not
nobody's exempt
yep so the the club birds are deathly
afraid of clots and can't really talk
about anything else
I mean I think that's pretty obvious do
you think that they would talk
obsessively about it if they weren't
concerned about it would they have any
care whatsoever about my opinion if they
weren't frightened to death of clots
no
it would be completely irrelevant it's
only their immense petrifying fear
that gives them the uh the energy to
come over here and spend time doing this
because of all the things that they
could be doing right now that they
decided very a lot of right now even
even at this moment a lot of them have
decided
to come over here and do this because
they're just frightened to death
I mean they're just shaking you can
almost see the comments are like shaky
uh so so now uh they're yelling
projecting
first in caps and now it's in all
capitals
with spaces between each of the letters
projecting that's a tell for cognitive
dissonance by the way
uh when you when you get totally pinned
yeah
so so now they're all the the frightened
to death clot birds are are yelling
projection because they know they've
been totally uh
totally owned
when you get totally owned then you say
projection that's always the last thing
so I know when the conversation has
ended and I've won when they're yelling
projection in all caps with a little
space in between that's like this is
that's as good as you can win
you claimed projection earlier you
midwit
right the first person who claims it
might be right
the second person who claims it never
all right so all the clot Birds you I'll
bet if you were to
uh check the health of all the club
Birds
compared to regular people I wonder if
it'd be different
I wonder if they'd be any different
you know the weirdest thing is that I'm
in perfect health right now
all the people are sure I made a wrong
Health Care decision
not enough doing pretty good
uh
my workouts better than they've ever
been
so there's that
all right
um and then we all fear inflation
inflation is one of those things that is
bipartisan
because it affects everybody but
everybody is about equally afraid of
inflation wouldn't you say
there's nobody Democrat or Republican
who who isn't kind of worried about
inflation so that one ends up not being
especially political because we're all
afraid of it
but I do think there's there's a
difference
in the conservative mind
versus the
um
the progressive mind it does seem to me
that conservatives see the greatest fear
in changing things would you agree
I think that's backed up by science
right
that conservatives are more afraid of a
change
because that change could be bad of
course it could I mean that's reasonable
you should you should definitely fear
change you know you know that famous
book who moved the cheese it's supposed
to teach you not to fear change
you should totally fear change
but like I can't think of anything
smarter than fearing change
don't you fight every day to prevent
change because you fear it
it's totally reasonable
but you know it's also reasonable
to change anyway
right it's reasonable to be frightened
to death of change it's not reasonable
to let that be the reason not to change
completely different
you know the the ideal situation is that
you do the things you're afraid of
because you know they have to be done
that's your perfect situation
so somewhere between the progressives
who are willing to change things
because they think that staying the same
is the the dangerous part they're afraid
of staying the same it's like ah it's
going to be more of whatever we don't
like
so I mean the wokeness thing I think is
fear
is power but it's also fear
so it's power in the sense that if you
can push your wokeness agenda it gives
you power over other people so power is
pretty predictive of what people do but
also
it's it's base is that they're being uh
discriminated against and their success
is based on other people holding them
down is fear-based
yeah I mean it's victim-based and
fear-based and power-based but there's
still fear there there's something
they're afraid of
sometimes for good reason sometimes not
why aren't conservatives afraid of
climate change because they they're
they're afraid of change
and the change is what we would do to
ourselves
the change is what we would do to
ourselves the change is not what nature
does
conservatives are afraid of their own
initiated changes like government
initiated changes and that's that's why
they'd be afraid of climate change I've
never seen a conservative who is afraid
of the weather
and in here I'm doing the conservative
framing where they're going to say ah
climate change is just weather I don't
say that by the way but that's that's a
common framing
um
yeah
Not Afraid just alert to change
well you know I think a lot of you are
going to try to wiggle out of your own
fears
because I'm not saying that every
political fear is like a in your heart
you know your stomach is hurt there are
some things that you just think are
better than other things because you say
you know if we do this
I'm worried that it'll be a slippery
slope
I would call that a fear
if you want to call that a reasoned
opinion of what is worse than something
else I would say that's just that's your
interpretation after the fact you start
with the fear
and that's the rationalization you put
on it no it's not a fear I did a
cost-benefit analysis it's not a fear so
that's exactly the rationalization
all right fear is too broad yeah
everything about politics is too broad
true that
all right that's all I wanted to say
today
and already I think we can guarantee
this is the best live stream
you've ever seen
Scott is afraid of mockery they say
am I
you am I afraid of mockery
yes or no
it's actually a yes no
I deal with it by embracing it
but if I suppose there's some kind of
mockery that would be bad for me
stixx love is greater than Club fear
yeah I'm afraid of water that's true
afraid of drowning I'm not not afraid of
water I'm afraid of too much of it with
too far to the shore
uh Ben Garrison mockery
well Ben Garrison I just use as kindling
so and I I've had some smart
well-meaning people say Scott
you seem to be you know answering your
critics too much just let it go let it
go terrible advice
terrible advice really bad advice here's
why here's why I don't let it go
first of all I do let go 90 of the
things I just don't let go anything that
would decrease my credibility
because my credibility is the only asset
I have
that's you know matters that allows me
to do what I'm doing
which I judge to be useful for other
people
so for me to be useful
to the tribe you know to the country to
the world for me to be useful
I have to be seen as credible
and there are some kinds of rumors that
I have to squash because they go
directly toward the credibility
so that's why the the clotters who
refuse to read the profile Link in my
Twitter profile they're they're all
worked up and excitable
because they have no idea what my actual
opinions are but I'm using them as
kindling and Ben Garrison because the
more energy I can attract
to the complaints the more energy I can
divert
to the explanation that makes the the
clot birds look silly
so the more collaborates there are now
the better it is for me in the beginning
they were annoying trolls
of no value whatsoever but when they
reach a certain level
then their their value starts to be
expressed because then I as an energy
monster I can start moving their energy
where I want it so that's what's
happening now so we're in the phase
where the club birds have fallen into
the Trap uh I know at this point they're
saying wait a minute you're just saying
that after the fact this was not in fact
a cleverly designed uh trap to attract a
bunch of people exactly like is
happening right now
no it was no it actually was it was
literally a plan to get as many of you
here saying exactly what you're saying
as I possibly could
and uh I wanted to get it into the media
so far it's only some sketchy media
hasn't gone to the like real media but
if I can drive this a little bit further
and if the clap Birds could maybe make a
little bit more noise we might be able
to move this onto regular media and if I
can get into the major media then that's
my win
that would be my big win
so you guys are helping me out now
you're uh the NPCs that I needed
you're exactly the NPCs I needed because
the authors of the reality just use the
NPCs for kindling
right do I care about Ben Garrison uh
has a bad opinion of my of my opinions
no
how could I possibly care about that
it's just a electrical activity in the
skull of a person I've never met how in
the world would that bother me
not at all but acting like it bothers me
generates all the activity from the club
birds and then the clot birds can make
be trend
if they keep going after me and if the
Clockworks make me Trend then I can move
to the regular media and then I can
exploit it as a proper energy monster
so you're all part of the plan
and uh
and and the copers are excellent so the
copers and the clotters sort of two
groups are exactly who I need to come
after me so if you could do some
tweeting
uh if you you should you should see the
comments over here I'll just show you
I'm going to show the locals people
uh the clot Birds
let's see
you see each other
why is this not working
um
I don't know why this isn't working
damn it the cameras on these two things
are not lined up so say where's the
camera on this one this camera is over
here
oh my God this is so hard it's like
quadruple mirrors I literally can't
figure this out
why is it I can't point to they're
literally just pointing at each other
why are they not
if I go this way
why doesn't that help
interesting
neither Direction improves it
oh that is a weird little illusion
there's some weird little illusion
where if I try to line up those two
cameras
moving it to the left makes it worse and
also moving to the right makes it worse
I don't exactly know what's going on I
don't know how that's possible because
there was literally just two iPads
facing each other but they weren't lined
up right
if I move it one way it makes it worse
but also the other way makes it worse
moving in didn't help moving in didn't
help it all
what's up with that that was weird I'm
sure that's a user error but anyway the
uh the copers
and the uh and the club Birds uh a
little more of that please
and tomorrow we'll be here the same time
tell your friends tweet about it bring
everybody
bring them all
why are you so quiet they all got quiet
all of a sudden
no I know I know where the camera is
located on the iPads and I was lining up
the camera to the screen it didn't make
any difference I don't know why it's
just weird
do they'll leave it once
what was it showing I I think just
turning the
they all disappeared at the same time
oh my God were they all organized so
much that they left at the same time
they're completely gone
it was the entire feed until I turned
the camera on the to show you and then
they literally disappeared
they're all gone
oh there we go here's another one cope
Claude Adams
only one left
there we go there see they're a little
bit shy
I guess they're shy
now they're back all right come on guys
get those get those coping clutters back
they're projecting coping clutters
I only engage with the Caps lockers
that's probably true I do engage with
the people who yell at me in caps lock
because mocking them is more fun
shy Coopers
the cringe killed them so now we have a
new theme the cringe
so now I'm a clutter and a copper but
there might be some cringe in the way
I'm dealing with it a little bit of
cringe
go with that go with the cringe too so I
would add the coping to the cringe
and the all caps and especially you
should say make sure you take this
message forward make sure you say I got
everything wrong about the pandemic
don't pick don't pick your shots
say I got everything wrong about the
pandemic because that works in my favor
because I would be
and obviously false claim but I think I
can goad you into it
just say I got everything wrong
I'm coping and clotting
how did you get over your fear of riding
a bike
I didn't
I just did it anyway
you know some of the best advice you've
heard this before the best advice is not
about conquering your fear
like I don't know who said this first
somebody smart but um
pyramid I took I'm a clotter I'm a coper
I'm a midnight toker okay that's good
uh the clotter I'm a coper I'm a
midnight toker
those of you who remember the 70s are
laughing at that those of you who don't
have no idea what's happening right now
hold on Trump just declared a war on
drug cartels stop stop the Press
stop the Press did that just happen
hello stop the Press open my truth I
don't know if that's true
but we'll see
true social
which has clearly demonstrated its value
let's see what Mr Trump is saying
uh
I don't see it on truth
nope that doesn't look real
so that's not real right
uh Trump didn't say anything about the
cartels
recently
what about April 1st 2020.
would I ever host a Twitter space Maybe
I don't need another platform
um
guesses money on the Run yeah okay
why did I ignore the trans issue for so
long well I didn't ignore it on the
sports side I was actually way into it
on the kids side
my thinking was it wasn't my business
um and I'm not too far from that
right there are some things that if it
looks like a family decision it's a you
know I also don't weigh in on abortions
you're all aware of that right
uh I don't weigh in on abortion because
I think that's a decision between
individuals who are in that situation
and I prefer the women to have their
primary voice in that and I also I'm
worried that I'm too influential and I
don't think male influence on the
abortion decision is helpful
he said he would attack the cartels but
he didn't say that recently right can
you confirm there's nothing recent from
Trump about the cartels where you're
just looking at Old statements right
what's that
look over here oh you've got the uh
there's a video all right it's listening
to the video I'm trying to click it come
on
comments are going
all right let's see if I can see this
I'm playing it on the
fentanyl heroin meth and other lethal
drugs are pouring across our wide open
border
stealing hundreds of thousands of
beautiful American lives am I gonna have
to endorse them never before in our
history children are being left without
parents families are being ripped apart
communities are being decimated I don't
know if you can still hear me some
fellow citizens are having their entire
worlds destroyed
destroyed like nobody thought possible
our country is being poisoned from
within by the drugs and by all of the
other crime that's taking place all
right let's listen to drug cartels are
Waging War in America
and it's now time for America to wage
war on the cartels
in this war Joe Biden is cited against
the United States and with the cartels
they are making more money than they've
ever made before times ten damn it
there's never been anything like it
they're major major companies they're
bigger than even some of our biggest
companies
Biden's open border policies are a
deadly betrayal of our nation when I am
president it will be the policy of the
United States to take down the cartels
just as we took down ISIS and the Isis
caliphate and just as unlike the
situation we're in today we had a very
very strong border the strongest Border
in fact in the history of our country
and drugs were at a low of 40
all right
um
can you see me again at locals
could you hear that
good here that the audio oh you could so
if I click a video you just go dark
right all right sorry about that
all right so the the part that I heard
that the YouTube people heard
is that Trump said he would fight the
cartels like he fought Isis
I hear more I hereby endorse president
Trump for 2024.
amen
I only asked for one thing
he's the only one who's offered it
only only one person said it clearly
and that's as clearly as you can say it
and by the way I give him a plus for
that as clearly as you can say it he
said we're going to treat the cartels
like Isis
there is nothing I wanted to hear more
than that
nothing because you know what treat them
like Isis means invade I'm sorry
invade Mexico
that's what that means that means that
we will not respect the territorial
Integrity of Mexico and we're going to
take care of business that's that's what
I want to hear I wanted to hear somebody
say if you put me in charge I will not
respect the territorial Integrity of
Mexico
now he didn't say that directly but he
said we'll treat him like Isis and I
don't know how else you can interpret
that because we're not gonna we're not
going to respect anybody's territorial
integrity
over Isis we've proved that he said
everything I wanted to hear
as soon as if he had said we're going to
bomb them I'm not sure that would be a
complete picture but when he says we're
going to treat them like Isis
I'm all in
I'm all in
I think I'll tweet it
caused some trouble today
yeah let's make it official
you know I really wasn't expecting that
I'm not even sure if I like it
because I don't want a president of that
age honestly
but let's cause some trouble here
where the
all right I'm gonna tweet
um
and Doris
do I call him president Trump or Trump
what is the uh yeah this is a promise so
I I'm keeping my promise
do we call him president Trump even X
right
okay we'll do that
for
2024
based solely I'm going to say solely
on
on his
promise
to treat
the cartels
like
basis
I endorsed president Trump for 2024
based solely on his promise to treat the
cartels like Isis
I'm
a one
issue
the voter
boom
well there's your there's your headline
now we already know that Trump wants to
ban Tick Tock he didn't get it done
but I feel like he could get it done
you know I I said I said I had one
criteria I'm a single issue voter
that's it
and by the way I don't think I would
believe a Democrat who said the same
thing would you
this was exactly what I wanted
now it's a fight now it's interesting
I'm all in now I'm all in
do you know what I care about January 6
nothing
nothing
suppose Trump did everything he was
accused of
don't care
suppose there's some new thing that's
like a scandal that he did don't care I
want to be really clear that I don't
care about anything else
single issue voter let's get one thing
done
let's see just get one thing done
yeah the plan was for Oracle to manage
Tick Tock in the USA
sorry that doesn't get it done
because that would only be the data the
idea for Oracle to manage some data in
the United States was only about data
security it wasn't about managing the
algorithm the algorithm is the dangerous
part
any anything that protects our data but
doesn't affect the algorithm is a
non-starter it's of minimal interest to
me
Trump has been searching for an issue to
run on well he found one
you got one
I'll tell you Trump's political
instincts
are really sharp
really sharp
they just caught the largest drug lord
in Mexico before Biden's visit is that
true
I doubt it
um bobert nominates Trump today are you
just guessing or is that happening oh El
Chapo's son
why does uh
look how quickly all the uh CL the clot
talk goes away when you say something
reasonable
did I finally say something reasonable
for once
all right endorsement zip
here's to president Trump in 2024
uh
for uh attacking the cartels and
treating them like Isis
it's all I wanted to hear Mr President
go get him
I'm all in
totally didn't want that to happen
totally did not want that to happen I do
not want to be once again associated
with whatever the hell Trump does that
makes people hate him and hate anybody
who I don't want any of that
I'm going to do this for you
all right this is entirely for you
right my stepson's already dead
right I can't bring him back this is for
your kids
I'm going to promote the guy who's
trying to protect your kids and I'm
going to do it at Great personal risk
and nothing's going to stop me
nothing's going to stop me
let's get to work
