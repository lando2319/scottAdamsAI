well the news on ukraine
seems to be all uh pointing in one
direction suddenly
doesn't mean it's true
doesn't mean it's true
because we're still in the fog of war we
don't really know what's happening in
ukraine and russia
but
it is notable
that even the russians are not
disagreeing with the coverage at the
moment and the coverage is saying that
the ukrainians are making major advances
against the positions of the russians so
they've gone 30 miles across the
previous line they've encircled well let
me go to the white board and give you an
update
i know it can be confusing because a lot
of people are you're not familiar with
the area
so
this map will explain the entire
situation
so
uh what you've got is you've got the
ukrainian forces that are surrounding
the
blakkava karbat region
but they're also making inroads in the
kolak for kappa and the akba kinzometer
the sasaki
is uh holding tight but there are a lot
of assets being lost in the coupons
and ludowski in pumpkin
so but this area in the just surrounding
the laksa macaba
is a
sustaining heavy fire but we do hear
that there there's a retreat in the
lagdakuriaka and the golden green in
but the key and peel are
making inroads as well
so
i think that
pretty much summed it up
now there is one thing that is uh
conspicuously missing
in this story
did you see anything missing
yes
airplanes
there don't appear to be any airplanes
in the story
what the hell is going on
don't you expect some jets
it's a war
i don't know what's going on
but there's so there's something very
unexplained
and the unexplained part is where's the
the russian air force
apparently it's not there
the russian air force apparently it just
doesn't seem to be part of the war
why
why
now one one theory is that the
ukrainians took delivery of some
advanced anti-aircraft
assets
from
nato countries
that could be the whole that might be
the whole uh
explanation it could be that the new
anti-aircraft is so good
that russia's would just be throwing
away jets in other words they wouldn't
gain enough
by putting a jet up there versus the
odds of losing it
now it may also be true that the
ukrainians had great success destroying
weapons depots and resupply lines
because that's the reporting don't know
if anything's true
remember everything out of this region
is suspect
and fog of war
but even the russians are not claiming
they're holding tight so the reporting
is
russians are retreating they're
abandoning the equipment
the ukrainians are basically taking over
cities within a fight
and it's starting to look like the
entire
russian army is collapsing
did you see that coming
now
could be a trick
could be a trick i mean maybe maybe
russia is like bathing in the you know
trying to get the ukrainian military in
there
but one report said that's what the
ukrainians did
to the russian army
the ukrainians allegedly again who knows
what to believe but allegedly they
actually baited the best russian forces
into a kill box and then started
degrading them and once they had
degraded the best russian forces
then they mounted the invasion and there
was nothing to stop him
that's what it looks like that doesn't
mean that's true remember everything
about this
is highly suspect
but here's the question i wonder about
you know that ukraine
was smart enough and skilled enough
especially zelinski
to know that persuasion is
maybe the most important part of the war
so as the lead ski's persuasion of the
west how would you rank it
was zielenski's persuasion skill
of his allies
give me a give me a grade what do you
think it was
i see an a plus
zelinski's persuasion skill i see a c
a plus a solid
nine and a ten b minus
all right i think he's closer to an a or
an a plus
now let me ask you this
do you think there's someone who's
capable
of that level of persuasion and by the
way this would be the very best in the
world
you know in my opinion what zelinski has
done is winston churchill level
persuasion
right
now you can you say what you want to say
about him you if you don't like him for
other reasons but persuasion wise
he has the goods
now here's my question
do you think that his persuasion only
works that powerfully with his own
allies
because this might be the variable that
everybody's missing
ukraine has quite intentionally been
running a
discouragement campaign against the
russian soldiers
trying to simply discourage them
from being interested in fighting
i think they may have succeeded
they may have succeeded because it's
hard for me to understand why russia is
not putting up a better fight
the that's sort of
unless it's a trap
and that would be a stretch
unless it's a trap it looks like their
will to fight has been broken
that's what it looks like now again pure
speculation
we're way too far away and
under-informed to know what's happening
but that's what it looks like it looks
like he broke their will
what do you think
is that hypothesis does it at least
match the facts that we can discern
it looks like it doesn't
now the bigger story of course is the
modern weapons and the fighting
the fighting skill and will of the
ukrainian military which apparently is
freaking awesome
as far as we can tell
so i i think the big story is going to
be the persuasion game
uh you remember the ukrainians were
taking pictures of the captured russian
soldiers
and they would find their social media
and they would send messages back to
their parents and stuff
they knew that it would take a while for
that persuasion to work
because they were doing it retail like
one one person at a time here's a
picture to your mother
here's a note to your mom
maybe it worked
we'll see
amazingly the russian police arrested
five uh government officials they
weren't very high level but
they had
these five officials said that uh putin
should be charged with treason for his
uh
his launching of the war in ukraine
now those five people are probably going
to be dead pretty soon but there were
five people who had successful lives in
russia
who just gave their lives
to protest putin
they just gave their lives
and they knew it
they knew it when they did it
so something's happening
something's happening over there
all right
