hey everybody
come on in it's a very newsy day
there's news all over the place you got
your real news
you got your fake news all kinds of news
you got your hoaxes and we have a brand
new hoax
the hoax of the day we don't have a name
for it yet
let's call it the losers and suckers
hoax
goes well with the fine people oaks the
drinking bleak
bleach oaks the overfeeding the goldfish
hoax and all of the other
hoaxes but first what do you need first
to get ready for all this excitement i
think you know you
you need a copper mug or a glass of tank
or gels or stein a canteen jerker flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's happening right now go
i feel the soul of michael forest
reinold going to hell
that's good coffee makes everything
better
all right good news on the economy
or as people who don't like president
trump
call it very bad news that's right
we can't even tell the difference
between good news and bad news
for example is it good news that the
unemployment rate has improved all the
way to 8.4 percent
surpassing the estimates of experts
you would think that would be good news
wouldn't you but no according to
washington post and new york times
that good news is filled with bad news
and if you add enough bad news together
i guess it just looks like good news to
people who don't know any better
like me but there's some core
uh long-term employment numbers within
those numbers that don't look so good
so i think it is true that there's some
internals that are
they're weak but if you're an optimist
you look at the big numbers if you're a
pessimist you dig in there and find
something to complain about and they did
amazingly one quarter of
all the people who were employed in
august in the united states
worked from home worked from home
one quarter of the united states worked
from home
what that's not going to change i mean
the one corner part will change
but if you thought we were going back
to a commuting society i don't know
i mean the the biggest reason to go back
to that commuting way
of life would be to get out of the house
so i guess it'll be some of that
here's my favorite my favorite peak 2020
story
there was a professor of african history
at george washington university it
matters to the story
that she was a professor of american
history
and she recently admitted that she'd
been living her life a lie
and that for all of her adult life she
had claimed
to be an african-american woman when in
fact she had zero african and
african american i guess you would just
say african
background she was literally just a
white girl
who had lived her life
and looks exactly like a white girl and
lived her life just telling people she
was black
and people and what's funny about this
is that nobody wanted to challenge it
because the people she was dealing with
nobody wants to be in that fight right
right if somebody says they're black
it's not really up to somebody else to
tell them they're not
and and that's not really the
conversation you want to get into
you know you can't win so i think
i think but the fact that she took us so
far that she became a professor of
african american history and you have to
ask yourself
could could a real white person get
hired
to be a professor of african history
i don't know what the hiring practices
are but if i had to venture a guess
i would say i would say you really
couldn't get hired for that job
as i understand the world and the way it
works
i don't think you get hired for that job
unless
they think you're african-american and i
could just wonder what that job
interview looked like
it's like yeah yeah i'm african-american
and i'd like to be a professor of
african history and you can see the
administrators whoever is doing the
hiring saying
i really want to say something right now
such as you're obviously not black
but i could be wrong about that
and i'm not going to take a one percent
chance of being wrong because
you know it is true that people can look
different from their ethnicity that's a
real thing
it's just it wasn't the thing in this
case
so everything about that story is
hilarious in in the sense of
really understanding where we're at and
how humans are wired
all right my favorite other story of the
day
i i'm typically not happy about somebody
getting gunned down
usually that's a bad thing but not in
this case
if the person is michael forrest rhino
or
now rhino as you know is a cousin of
cornholio
if you've ever watched beavis and but
ahead do you know cornolio
this guy's cousin and anyway he was the
the guy who allegedly allegedly and
admittedly shot the trump
supporter who i guess was a
pro-police person now think about this
this this guy murdered somebody who was
demonstrating
in favor of police the police show up
how happy are they go to shoot this guy
now what was not reported in the story
is how many bullet holes are in michael
forest reinhold how many bullet holes do
you think he has in him
well we'll probably hear a lot about it
because i assume there'll be a mass
protest
because isn't that what happens when
someone gets shot by the police
don't we have a massive protest to
to you know demonstrate against the
police brutality
oh wait let me check his nope nope
not for him turns out we don't have a
mass protest
for a murderous white man
now i would like to uh to
see if i can crawl a little bit closer
to getting cancelled
it it my trick here is that if i only go
a little bit each time
they'll be hard to cancel me for a
specific thing because it'll just be
oh but not that one thing you said that
just moved it
one percent or we're really waiting for
the the one we can nail you on
but we know it's coming all right so
here's me getting a little closer to
cancellation
if you knew there were two groups of
people
let's say in a country or anywhere else
and the only difference
let's say the only difference between
the two groups is that one of them
idolized its criminals and the other
said it's it's a good day when their
criminals get
shot and killed which of those two
groups
will do better in society would it be
would it be the group that keeps as
heroes
criminals or would it be the group that
says
thank you for shooting our criminals
one of those two groups is going to be
more successful
so keep that in mind um
and i've said before that we should stop
sorting the world into
ethnicity and gender instead
we should sort the world into strategy
very much the way we're looking at the
coronavirus
response is anybody looking at the
coronavirus
response and say and saying how did the
black people do
no no that's
quite appropriately that's not a
question
is anybody looking at the coronavirus
responses across
countries and saying how'd the asians
not exactly because it's not really an
appropriate question
what we are asking is how did this
strategy work
how did the swedish strategy work how
did the u.s
strategy work how did taiwan or new
zealand's
strategy work isn't that the right way
to look at it
to look at what people did and if you
did these things did it work better than
the people who did these things
that is a productive way to work look at
the world
but when we're looking at our own
citizens and who's succeeding and who
isn't
we don't do that we don't look at the
ones who have good strategy and say
all right let's just look at the ones
with good strategy
now if you took all the people with good
strategy
and the and within the group of good
strategy the black people
for example let's say they weren't doing
as well
well now you've got a real problem that
that really has isolated
racism i would say could be systemic
racism
could be ordinary racism against an
individual
but if they're using the same strategy
and they're getting different outcomes
that would be the most worrisome thing
but if people are getting different
outcomes with completely different
strategies why are we even talking about
their ethnicity
how does that even come into the
conversation
what does their gender have to do with
it if they're doing different things
you got to do the same thing or else you
can't be analyzed for
whether racism is in that equation it's
always in the equation but
identifying it is hard unless you
isolate the other variables
so here's another funny thing we'll get
to the the hoax of the day in a little
bit
b machiavelli on uh
and twitter uh had this funny tweet he
said i'm voting twice
once in the polls for biden and once in
the booth for trump i think that's going
to describe a lot of people
and he showed a picture of himself
wearing a biden hat on the outside
but under his jacket was a trump shirt
and i thought to myself i think i'm
going to get a biden hat
because if you're going out in public a
biden hat would work a little bit like a
hard hat wouldn't it
you wear a hard hat into a construction
zone because you don't want heavy
objects to hit you in the head
if you go into a public place in 2020
you also don't want something to hit you
in the head because it turns out that
being in any kind of a crowded
situation in 2020 it's probably a riot
or you know or something that's going to
become one
and you are worried about getting hit in
the head so you can't protect yourself
completely
but i would wear a biden biden baseball
cap
it would greatly greatly reduce the odds
of me getting hit in the head in public
so it's like a hard hat um
and uh somebody else said i think it was
brian
rosen said this
frame biden in the streets and trump
between the
the sheets i i modified this statement
there to add between
biden in the streets and trump between
this between the sheets
all right uh so that's funny
uh another funny story is there was an
american
who was tricked into writing russian
disinformation
so it was that you were some guy who was
at an and a work but he wanted to be a
writer
and he saw a publication called peace
data you know the prestigious
publication
piece data you probably subscribe to it
don't you
i mean who hasn't read a copy of peace
data
that well-known publication and
the the so-called editor who was not a
real person he was actually a
computer-generated
photo which is scary because it looks
exactly like a person
and that whoever was behind the fake
identity contacted him and paid him a
few hundred dollars per article
to write articles that apparently they
would
they would select to be pro-russian
propaganda
now apparently the same russian troll
farm that did the
facebook ads is associated with this
uh this disinformation and
i think to myself the funniest thing
about the russian
troll farm is how bad they were
and how completely ineffective they were
yeah they existed
yes there seems to be good evidence that
they made
memes that were interfering with the
election
but they were so bad the memes they look
like i've said this
many times it looked like a high school
project and
they didn't even put much money into
them and they didn't even persuade in
the same direction
they were completely amateurish work
and now they've added to this hiring 26
year olds to write articles for a
publication that nobody reads
peace data and
i think to myself is this really the
finest
russian disinformation or is it
disinformation
to get caught doing something that's so
amateurish
that you that when you catch them you
say well i guess we don't have to worry
about russia
i mean look how easy they were to catch
look how weak their effort was
but are they so clever that they
actually have a super clever thing
that's going on that they're diverting
our attention
and we never see it because they've
acted so intentionally stupid on this
other one
well i don't know i don't know i'm not
smart enough to know if this is a
super clever diversion or if russia
is just really really really bad
at interfering with elections i don't
want to brag
but i could interfere with our election
better
all by myself i wouldn't even need a
you know the kgb went up whoever there
the
intelligence agency of the uh
of russia i wouldn't even need their
help they could say we'll give you a few
hundred dollars if you i'd say yeah
keep it i i got this i could interfere
with an election
so much better than russia um
even howard kurtz is calling president
trump's
piece or at least the whoever did the
title to the piece
called it a master stroke when he
suggested voting twice
now i feel as if i was one of the first
people to be on to this method which is
the president says and how many times if
i said
exactly this he'll say something that is
a little bit wrong but it's the
wrongness
or a lot wrong it's the wrongness that
makes you unable to look away
if he said things that were ordinary
you'd say
okay fine and then you'd go on with your
business but if he says something that
you know to be wrong or dangerous or
provocative
or just just too far over the line
you can't look away all of your
attention will go to that thing
even if you don't want it to even if you
know it's a trick
it's just good technique and so uh
howard kurtz says call down
in his article and i think he's
completely right that when the president
suggested that maybe you should do a
mail-in vote and then go vote in person
anyway
and then cheekily he suggested that
you couldn't do it anyway so even if you
tried to break the law
it wouldn't be possible because the
people
who oppose the president have told us
it's not possible
they would immediately flag it that's oh
no you've already voted by mail
you don't need to vote by by machine
but your common sense and everything you
know about the government
everything you know about human beings
everything you know about complicated
situations
everything you know about bureaucracy
everything you know about politics
is screaming in your head this mail and
vote thing is
a problem and so the president makes you
think about that problem
and also gives you a specific challenge
do you think you could vote
twice and i'll tell you i don't think
there's anybody on either side
who doesn't think that you could vote
twice
is there is there even one person in the
united states
who is such a simpleton that they
believe you couldn't vote twice
you could vote twice don't do it
it's a i think it's a federal offense
right sounds like a bad deal
but if you had let's say mailed your
ballot not too long ago i'm not sure
when the the mailing deadline is
but if you'd mailed your ballot not too
long ago
do you think that somebody at the voting
booth or the voting area
would have in their extensively accurate
records that
that your ballot got counted i don't
think so
so it's kind of brilliant the president
has made people think about
this and makes his point well taken
i hope that it doesn't cause people to
vote twice
and go to jail or even just
ruin the election you don't want that
so that's why only only trump would even
say something like that
because it's so dangerous that you say
to yourself ah
but how many times has the president
done something that was dangerous
that worked out fine he kind of does it
a lot
i think i'll drone solomon a no you
can't do that
okay that worked i think i'll move the
embassy to
jerusalem you can't okay that worked
i think i'll say the golan heights
belongs to israel you can't
okay that seemed to work okay you can't
start a trade war
okay china seems to be getting flexible
now i guess you can
so every time he does something that's
way too dangerous
fairly consistently it seems to work out
which means that he has a better sense
of what is really dangerous
and what is it so far
all right but i
and the people who are saying that
there's no history of mail fraud
in this country probably a right in
terms of
big enough fraud to sway an election
but we know at the same time that
there's definite fraud
you know individual cases that that can
be verified
uh in the mail in the news recently
there was somebody who admitted he
he was part of organized efforts to to
change male votes so we know that it
happens on the small
but the argument is that it's never
happened enough
in history where there was mail-in to
make a difference
to which i say uh that doesn't make
sense
that's not an argument it's not an
argument that it hasn't been a problem
in the past
because 2020 is not like the past it's
not like it in terms of what kind of
mail-in votes it will be
it's different if you request a ballot
you're probably a real person
if they just send you ballots well
you're going to get somebody else's
ballot in the mail
and you may or may not fill it out so
there are lots of
weaknesses that in 2020 that just
wouldn't have existed before
what about the states several states who
have had a
mailing mail mail in voting for a while
did they get it right on the first try
probably not probably took a little bit
of scrubbing the database
probably had to set up some systems to
double check stuff
if you did all that you might be in good
shape
but we haven't done all that and we
don't have any baseline for which to
compare our results this year
the one thing that's the biggest change
this year
is that no matter what the results are
mail and vote or
even regular vote you're not going to
know
if that's what it should have been
imagine if you were
if you will that you're some state and
it's not 2020 it's
sometime in the not too distant past you
were thinking about going to mail-in
votes
you could look at all your prior
elections where people mailed it
voted in person you could say okay if
our mail in votes
come in really close to what we voted in
in person then we'll say all right that
looks like
the mail-ins and the in-person were kind
of close
but if it's 2020 and it's a coronavirus
year
you don't know what's going to happen
and how that will compare to any prior
year
so this is the most dangerous situation
because the mail invoke could say almost
anything
and you would have a poll that supports
it because the polls
in many cases are false so there will
always be at least one poll
that supports no matter what the outcome
is
there will be at least one poll that
says yeah look we predicted it
it's not that uncommon for only one or
two polls to be close
this is just like that yeah it's abide
in by 10.
look at my poll i've got a poll that
said he was going to win this state by
10. there you go
the other polls didn't say that but
that's not unusual
it's not unusual that only a few polls
are really good
and other ones are not so there's no
baseline how would you know this is
false
anyway so that's happening
i would like to before we talk about the
new hoax
i would like to remind you
and there will probably only be a few
people on this periscope who ever heard
me say this
because it was so long ago can you in
the comments
confirm that
maybe 10 or 15 years ago
i first started saying the following you
know all those scientific studies
that show that moderate drinking is good
for your health
i alone on planet earth said
yeah there are a lot of those studies
they keep they keep producing a new one
and each time each time it seems to show
that moderate
drinking is actually good for you and
what did i say
fake every one of the studies
fake i said that 10 to 15 years ago
somebody else said that too oh good
we've got some confirmation
so there there are people on on the
uh you know the comments who are saying
that they confirmed that i've been
saying for years that those studies
would be debunked
and today the wall street journal
in an article saying that men should not
have more than one drink per day that's
a new lower standard the article just
brushes aside those prior studies and
says that
more recent studies have debunked them
and it was a selection
bias problem that's right
it was a selection bias they were
picking people who probably had a
mediterranean diet is what the
wall street journal speculated so
the people who knew that who knew it
from the first moment
that it was fake news those are the
people you should listen to
in the future now if i'd only ever
gotten one prediction right
well that doesn't mean much but look at
the body of my predictions
but especially look at the ones where
i've debunked a news story
no matter how much evidence there was
for that news story
that i debunked it publicly and was
right
so you know you were still looking at
the cuban
uh sonic weapon or the cuban embassy
sonic weapon
i said from moment one there's no sonic
weapon
none has been found it's been a long
time
i think we would have found the sonic
weapon by now
when the uh the shooting happened in las
vegas
ice and even people were saying it's
isis
i said on day one this is not isis
isis claimed credit for it i still said
in public
even though isis has a long history of
not claiming credit for things unless it
was pretty real might have been wanting
one exception i still said
even though they've claimed credit it's
not isis
and it wasn't so look at my record and
now let's talk about this
newest hoax
so the newest hoax comes from the
atlantic uh
jeffrey goldberg i guess wrote it and
the the claim is that there are four
anonymous sources
who said that trump didn't want to go to
the
event in france to honor the
service people for world war ii i guess
or was it one
but anyway he canceled a visit and
they're saying it's because he didn't
want to get his hair messed up
so that's the first part and then the
second part allegedly
i can't believe they would even write
this all right they claimed
that
trump labeled as losers marines who died
in the battle of belleau wood
during world war one referring to the
war
trump allegedly asked who were the good
guys in this war
and that and he called them losers and
suckers
if they were if they died in the war now
if you can't tell that that's not true
if you can't tell that's not true just
by listening to it
then i've taught you nothing but i will
i will
uh reiterate the lesson here here are
all the signs that this is
an obvious hoax and there were so many
of them i ran out of i literally ran out
of room
writing down all the obvious flags for
this big hoax
number one the timing the timing
you know close to an election definitely
ramps up the chance
that somebody would make something up
especially if biden looks like he's in a
little bit of trouble
if biden work had a commanding lead
you wouldn't see as much fake news
because they wouldn't need it
so in this situation do they need fake
news
to beat trump and i would say yes
because the real news
isn't going to be negative enough they
needed fake news
and they needed it now now that alone
doesn't make it fake news right
that should just that should just make
your antenna start vibrating
it's like all right that's not enough to
tell me if it's real or not real
but i'm on the lookout all right so
that's your first flag
number two we know that
the democrats have admitted that they're
going to be using artificial
intelligence
to figure out how to manipulate and
brainwash
the masses they don't use those words
but as
clearly as i'm expressing it they have
expressed it they just use different
words
now what would it look like
if an ai came up with a line of attack
what would it look like have you seen
the articles about ai
trying to write a blog post and it
actually fooled people
and you can look at it and you can see
that when an artificial intelligence
tries to write an article pretending to
be a human
it does have some tells in it and the
first
tell is that it seems to be based on
frequency of keywords
in other words if it picks up a tendency
it doesn't have any intelligence really
on that but it just
it picks up the tendency so okay
people are talking about this this word
gets used a lot i'll throw that into the
sentence
i'll make grammar that makes sense and
boom it looks like a person
said it so here's
here's the tell that this wasn't human
generated
or if it was human generated somebody
who's not good at it
and what i mean is not good at writing
okay
so in order to create a good hoax
the best kind of hoax is one uh i'll
wind back to my point we'll get to a
point here
a good hoax is one that only the person
who is the subject of the hoax
believes that that's your best hoax
because if it's something that everybody
believed
that's pretty rare first of all but you
want something that only the
the subject believes i'll give you an
example
uh let's say i was such a narcissist
that i believe that even at my current
age and with my current
unpleasant uh look that i could be a
model
because i believe and i'm the only one
who believes this that i'm really just
so sexy
that yeah i'm an older guy and yeah
i don't have anything that a model would
typically have i got glasses and bald
you know
blah blah but a perfect hoax for me
if i were believing that i was model
beautiful
and nobody else did what would be to
call me under a fake name and say hey
you know you don't know me but i'm a
model
uh agent i'd like to hire you to be a
famous model
now the reason that's a good hoax is i'm
the only person who would fall for that
in this scenario everybody else who was
watching the hoax
would know in a heartbeat it's not true
because just look at me
so i'm the only person who would have
the blind spot that's that's
that's a good hoax
and here's how that blind spot fits
with the ai and with the bad writer
concept
the the initial you want to build a hoax
around a kernel of truth
and here's here are the kernels of truth
number one
can you believe that the president would
say something unpleasant about
somebody yes as a general statement
the president could insult people would
you believe
that he might say something crueler
behind closed doors
than he might say in public yes
completely believable that anybody
really would be a little more unguarded
not in public but here's the
here's the part remember where uh trump
said something about mccain
being captured and prisoner of war i
forget the exact words but
trump quipped and probably wishes he
hadn't
that he prefers people who didn't get
caught
now here's the trick if you have a sense
of humor
you know that that was nothing but a
joke and it was a joke
about mccain it wasn't a joke about
people in the service it wasn't a joke
about prisoners of war but it
so easily became that when the public
got a hold of it
then it was probably a mistake he
shouldn't have done that joke
the first thing you need to know is that
one-third of the public
doesn't understand a joke doesn't even
recognize it
and you saw that in that story a lot of
the coverage
failed to understand that it was a joke
somebody says it was a dave chappelle
joke no it was a chris
rocket joke trump actually used the same
joke and i don't know if he saw it from
chris rock i think chris rock did it
first
about mccain and he said you know he's a
hero but
some version of you know i prefer people
who don't get caught
now the reason it's funny is because
it's terrible
it's the terribleness of it that makes
it funny
because when you're thinking and you're
your head is in the uh
american prisoner of war military hero
model
so your brain is thinking you know the
the greatest amount of respect
and then you hear somebody make this
clever witticism that takes this
greatest amount of respect you could
ever have and reduces it down to that i
like people who didn't get caught
it just turns them into somebody who was
bumbling
is hilarious and it's hilarious because
it's so inappropriate
if you take out the fact that it's
inappropriate
it's not a joke it's only a joke because
it's inappropriate
and and overtly inappropriate in a way
that's intended
and designed to make you laugh now if
you didn't know that trump was doing the
same
joke literally the same joke not
almost the same joke the same joke as
chris rock
and he delivers with a you know straight
face most of the time
he doesn't laugh at his own jokes so the
news was like
we're not sure so it allowed a third of
the people to believe that he really
said that and really meant it
and he had some animus against even a
prisoner of war that he would
speak uh disrespectfully for now
if you believed that that was true and
you didn't understand that it was always
a joke and it was always just about
mccain it was never about
service people uh if you didn't know his
joke
how easy would it be for you to believe
that he said a similarly disrespectful
thing
in another circumstance it's really easy
so if you are going to design let's say
you were an ai
and you were going to design a hoax
you would start with one that's got a
little bit of confirmation
bias already built in the part where
people are already primed to think that
trump would say something like that
behind closed doors so that's perfect
but here's the tell that it was an ai
or a human who's really bad at writing
a good human writer would have known it
was a joke
and would have made the new thing also a
joke
that's the part that's missing if
if this story this obvious hoax that was
written in the atlantic
if this obvious hoax had
gone the extra mile and turned this new
allegation this
obviously didn't happen but if they'd
put it in the form of a joke
they could have sold it because that's
how you know it wasn't trump
trump leaves a signature with these
things the joke
we just talked about trump saying you
should vote twice
that has trump's signature on it
you could take that story and remove it
from trump
and say who said this and most of the
world would say okay that's funny
because it's so inappropriate why is it
funny to say you should vote twice
because it's so inappropriate that's
what's funny
is it funny to say that you know trump
likes people who didn't get caught very
inappropriate
that's why it's funny the trump sense of
humor
has a fingerprint to it that's sort of
unmistakable
if you're a good writer if you're an ai
you don't see it because you just see
the keywords
if you're a bad writer or you didn't
know he meant it as a joke the first
time you saw it
you would not make your hoax include a
joke
either because you would think well it's
more true to the original
if i just play it straight but trump
doesn't
that's your that's your biggest tell so
trump would never just
say a thing that would get him obviously
if he had ever said that out loud he
would know that it would get back to
people
he would know it would be the end of his
presidency if people believed it
so uh the the odds of him having said
that are
zero essentially all right here's
another here's some more
tells number one not number one
uh cnn is downplaying it
okay i looked on cnn's page because i
thought okay
is this going to be like the major story
because it's just like read me it's like
oh we got another
another thing nope cnn put it on the far
right
in one no picture just text
and just treated it like an allegation
cnn did not pounce
do you know why do you know why cnn did
not pounce
by the way msnbc did bounce do you know
why cnn didn't pounce
isn't it exactly
isn't it exactly the right kind of story
for cnn to pout
on can you think of anything that would
be more red meat
for cnn than this story and they didn't
pounce on
it they're playing it a little bit soft
now that may have changed even since i
saw it this morning
but the initial reaction was to downplay
it
what does that tell you it tells you
they know it's not true and they can't
take another hit
cnn is obviously wounded
by all the fake news it has promoted and
it just
can't take another hit and this one is
so
obviously not true that even cnn
couldn't take a chance on it
that's another flag all right the other
flag is it's in the atlantic
the atlantic is not anything close to a
credible
news organization they would be closer
to russia today
closer to i don't know less credible
than the national enquirer
now i don't know what they used to be
but in 2020 the atlantic
is a gigantic you know flashing sign
that says
whatever you read in here is not true
it's probably the most
fake news publication in america
coincidence is it a coincidence that
this did not appear
in say the new york times
you know it wasn't their scoop it wasn't
the scoop of
let's say even the washington post as
disreputable as they are
it had to be in the atlantic because who
else is going to publish
four anonymous sources you know a basic
journalist's
standard is if you can't get at least
one person
to go on the record maybe you don't
publish that so anonymous sources
is your you know of course a big red
flag the atlantic
big red flag the author jeffrey goldberg
big red flag the fact that it was
written like an ai or a bad writer
instead of having that signature humor
that
trump has big red flag the timing of it
big red flag the fact that biden needs a
hail mary pass to win big red flag i
mean
this is just flags all the way but here
here's the most obvious one
it's a little too on the nose it's a
little too perfect
have i told you that if you hear let's
say there are two news stories
one news story is a shark attacks
a surfer now if you heard that story
you'd say well it doesn't happen a lot
but that's a thing you know that could
happen
but let's say you heard this story a man
attacks a shark with just his bare teeth
and he kills a shark by biting it to
death
if you heard that story would you need
research to know it's fake
you shouldn't immediately upon hearing
it you should say ah
that just by its nature i know didn't
happen
and the the trump story about the the
losers and the suckers
that has that written all over it it has
the exact look of
yeah no man bit a shark no seriously
seriously a man bit a shark and he
killed the shark
with his uh jaws he just he just
ironically with his jaws he
he bit the shark to death yeah that
happened that totally happened
you shouldn't need to do research
to know that that didn't happen so this
is in that class
all right uh
and all right i got a few more uh oh
here's another one
one of the sources is malcolm nance
now if you've never heard that name
before the only thing you need to know
is if if you were looking for a big red
flag that
a story is not true associating it with
malcolm nance would be the biggest of
the big flags
there's no there's no name i don't think
i don't think there's another name in
america
that would be less credible than malcolm
nance
you can do your own googling to find out
why i'm saying that
but just that the fact that that's a
source
if you knew nothing else and you knew he
was the source
you should immediately discount this as
ridiculous
how about the fact that even john bolton
debunked it in his book
so part of the claim about why trump
didn't go to the ceremony
the you know the new claim is he didn't
want to get his hair disheveled in the
in the wind which is ridiculous because
trump does lots of outdoor
uh events all the time
um but uh the fact that bolton tells a
completely different
version of that story and bolton hates
the president
bolton doesn't like the president and he
even he told a completely different
version
so if you know that part of the story
almost certainly has to be false because
even bolton told a different version
then the rest of it's false like if a
big part of it
can be confirmed to not be true and i
think the john bolton thing is about as
close as you can get to a confirmation
then you know no credibility for the
rest
um how about uh
does it work let's talk about whether
the hoax will work
here's the bad news yes yes that
that hoax could actually cost trump the
election
it's actually that powerful it's as
powerful as the
fine people hoax and it will work the
same way
which is that people who want to believe
it's true
are just going to believe it's true and
there's nothing you can do to talk them
out of it
now can you prove can you prove
something didn't happen
no that's the beauty of this you can't
prove something didn't happen
you can't prove a negative you can
sometimes prove things did happen
but it's not a thing to prove something
didn't happen
all you can know is that you don't have
evidence that's all you can know you
can't prove it didn't happen
generally speaking so it's sort of
perfect that way
um i would expect that
some number of people will believe this
and it will change their votes
it could easily be powerful enough as a
hoax
to change the the nature of the election
now what do you do about
it if you get wounded by a hoax and you
have the entire
media complexes not going to debunk it
what do you do
unfortunately you just you just deal
with it
it's a wound and it's a real one
and it's not going to go away now the
only way that this
could go away is if something remarkable
happened
such as let's say all four people who
are the sources
came forward and said no no we just made
it up now that's not going to happen
but you can imagine some amazing
scenario in which
maybe it all blows up but assuming that
it doesn't
because the the fine people hoax is
still alive and well
even though it's the most widely
debunked hoax in american history
nothing is more debunked or more easily
debunked
because you could just show the actual
transcript or show the video
and still it completely works
the reason the fine people hoax is so
pervasive is that it works
people do believe it despite how easily
it's debunked
this one is just like that it's really
deadly
and it happens to graft a little too
well
to the president's biggest
unexploited weakness if you found out
that suddenly before the election
there was an artificial intelligence
involved in a campaign
and suddenly also at about that same
time you found that out
you found that they had opened a new
line of attack
that was innovative i would say this is
an
innovative attack wouldn't you to go
after the president's strength
because his strength is the military in
law law enforcement that's his strength
america patriotism
service so going after his strength
is a non-obvious move
does a human come up with that
i don't know it has it has a whiff
of artificial intelligence because
artificial intelligence could pick a
target
that a human just wouldn't have seen it
would seem invisible to you to go after
his strength but you're only looking to
chop
two percent off remember you're not
trying to change everybody's mind
and so a good hoax that goes against his
strength
is a really solid play it's you know
it's just it's a despicable
it's unethical it's immoral it's all
those things but it's really effective
so the fact that they went after his
strength
kind of tells me that that there's a
little
extra going on here maybe they've
identified that
it's the lowest information
voter now i don't want to say something
that's
insulting to our
heroes in the service but would you say
that it might be true that they may be
less less into politics in other words
the younger you are
probably the less you're following
things if you're in the military
you got better things to do you're
probably just following the surface
stuff
you're not really digging into the
details so by identifying a group
that is somewhat isolated from the news
if you can penetrate their isolation and
get that rumor in there
nothing can get it out so the ai
may have done two things it may have
found a
uh an attack place sort of like the
death star
you know you know if you've all watched
uh star wars you know that there's just
one weakness in the
in the death star it could be that the
ai found that one weakness
figured out how to exploit it with a
with a
targeted hoax but also may have found
out that once you get the hoax in there
there's something about that population
that makes it harder to get rid of the
hoax could be
it's also possible that because there's
so much emotional content
evolved with our service people
especially families
that it's it's just something that
people can't think
rationally about it just has too much
too much emotional content all right
so what would you do if you were the
trump campaign and you were the
recipients of this hoax and it worked
you would of course do all your denials
and the president's doing that
but because people don't believe the
president especially if they're
anti-trump
it doesn't really help the denials are
not going to make much difference at all
and even the other people saying i was
with him every minute it never happened
well nobody's with everybody anybody
every minute
so you could easily say well we don't
know
so here's the only thing you could do
you have to come up with your own hoax
that's just as bad the only defense to
this
is offense if trump plays defense he
loses
trump on defense is not a good trump
trump on offense
oh that's a good trump so trump has to
figure out how to go on offense
and even if he were succeeding in just
changing the focus of the news cycle
which we assume he will do
it's probably going to be an interesting
day i'm sure president trump will change
the news cycle
that alone isn't enough because once
that stain gets in there
it's just not coming out i mean he that
that hoax may have taken
two percent right off of his off of his
pole
polling numbers um so i'm not going to
recommend this
i'm just telling you uh the only
the only response that could work is an
equally bad
hoax about biden that sticks
now you would have to design your hoax
as good as this one
this is a really well designed hoax
because
as ridiculous as it is and as obviously
fake as it is it's only obviously fake
to the people who are smart enough to
know that and they're not the ones
they're trying to influence
we are completely irrelevant all of us
who know that it's a fake news story
we're not relevant because nobody
listens to us
you know we're that we're like the boy
who cried wolf or something
we can scream all day nobody's gonna
listen
so if trump could do the same thing it
would be
devastating now if you were to design a
hoax for biden
you would do the same process you would
find something that had not yet been
exploited
so it's fresh you know something is new
something that has a great emotional
content
and if you heard it you could never be
objective about him again
so uh and i think that's been tried
before so
accusations about uh let's say an
accusation about biden
and an underage female
now this didn't happen as far as i know
i'm not trying to start a rumor i'm
giving you an example
if you if you believe that biden is a
little touchy
and even his own supporters would admit
that if you
agree that he's he sniffs a little bit
too much hair
and i think even his supporters would
say yeah there's a little hair sniffing
we're not comfortable with
so you start with something that people
are biased to believe
and then you add the thing that is
purely ridiculous
so a purely ridiculous thing might be
for example
that there was some underage girl that
he did some bad thing with
now it's one thing to hear that maybe
something happened with a staffer the
tara reed
thing but still those are adults
and as bad as that is and the me too way
if you believe that it's true it's still
adults
and that doesn't hit you the way
anything would if a child was involved
so that would be the response
but that would be unethical and immoral
but it would totally work
just as the the losers and suckers
hoax will work
here's a question for you
how are we going to avoid a civil war
how are we going to avoid a civil war
what would it take
to not have violence after the election
here are some things we can be sure of
we can be sure that no matter what the
result
um people won't be happy
if let's say if trump loses narrowly
or just loses at all would trump
supporters
likely start a revolution let's say they
didn't even believe the vote they
thought the vote was a little rigged
would trump supporters go to the streets
and cause a revolution like a civil war
and the answer is no no i don't think
they would
because they might take as the supreme
court they might want the legal system
to be involved
they might scream like crazy but they're
not they're not going to become the
anti-far
they're not going to they're not going
to you know try to overthrow the country
but what if it goes the other way yeah
if it goes the other way will the biden
people
if they lose narrowly or not narrowly
will they just go quietly
no no no of course not
so the way it's shaping up is a trump
win
followed by a civil war and that could
last
months or whatever now i don't know how
much violence that means it could mean
just
civil unrest and more businesses getting
burned which would be plenty bad
but certainly we have a real dangerous
situation
what would it take to fix that
there's a you know we can actually see
the the fuse burning
it's like you can see the pile of
dynamite
and it's you know november 4th let's say
day after
the election and then you can see the
fuse which
goes all the way to today and you can
see the fuse is lit
we're watching it in real time the fuse
is actually
lit what's going to stop it
from turning into a civil war
and so i will take that as
my my task
[Applause]
the only thing that would change it is a
feat of persuasion that
you know uh deactivated the bomb
prior to the civil war
could there be such a strong bit of
persuasion
that you could actually you know
completely snuff out a civil war because
that would be
some pretty big persuasion and so
i don't know but
we'll see we'll give it a try so i'm
going to make that
my to-do my personal task
to save the country not not
single-handedly of course
but rather to think a little bit more
productively about
what it would take to change the mindset
in america
too productive what would it take
now so somebody says kanye yeah kanye's
uh kanye maybe he would be important for
healing the country but i think that
it's going to require something more
than that something that we haven't seen
something we haven't thought of yet and
i will take that as my
uh oh there is a story about biden
groping a secret service agent's
girlfriend
but again that's a story about adults
and as bad as it might be if it were
true don't know if it is
as bad as that would be still isn't as
bad
as this losers and suckers hoax against
trump because that one really gets that
gets to your core
whereas accusations about adults no
matter how bad
you just say that's a bad world we wish
it didn't happen
uh you just have a different feeling
about it
all right um switch off the internet
i believe that there is uh
a way to go here the the ideal way to go
would be for
um the black voters to realize
that they've been had the antifa
is not on their side and i don't think
that's far away
if you could convince black voters
and when i say convince i don't mean lie
to them
i mean it's it's fairly obvious
so what i'm talking about is actually
observably true
that antifa is not on the side of black
americans
black americans for the most part would
like
prosperity and jobs and education safety
you know the ability to be not be afraid
of police
they'd like a lot of stuff that
republicans want to give them
republicans want to give them the things
they want
antifa wants to take it all away wants
to take it away from
rich white people wants to take away
from poor black people wants to take
everything away
and if you can make the case that antifa
is the enemy of black america and that
the the black lives matter movement
is just a corrupt thing that's working
against
the interest of black voters
that could be something and if you look
at the support numbers from african
americans
for president trump you can see that a
lot of black voters
have let's say emerged from the fog
of fake news and said to themselves
some version of wait a minute
why would i believe these guys
let me just put it in the form of a
question just just imagine you're
you're a black american voter you've
been involved with the protest
and you suddenly have this thought about
antifa
why would i believe those guys
what is it about those guys that would
make me believe that they have my best
interest
nothing absolutely nothing in fact
literally everything about antifa says
that they're gonna get they're gonna
screw you next
because that's their whole deal their
deal is not to
create a you know society where
everybody's doing well they're
literally looking to rip everything
apart and that means
your stuff too so black americans you
you would lose your stuff and you would
lose it fast
under your your own partner's
anti-fuzz uh preference all right
um i'm looking at your comments
and blm the same as marxist
yeah and
let me work on fixing this whole protest
thing
and i'll get back to you with some some
ideas on that
what if he croaks after winning somebody
saying goodbye
well he will die after winning we just
don't know how long it'll take
um
stop the money yeah you know
if you've been watching the internet you
know that there's some thought that the
the guy who killed the
uh killed the guy in portland
that there were things look a little
more organized
than you would expect meaning that there
may be there's some foreign or domestic
military style organization involved
with the anti-antifa stuff
i'm not sure i'm buying that completely
but there's enough
evidence and there are enough
indications that
i'd say it's a 65 chance that
the antifa blm stuff is not american
organic
so i don't think it's an organic
movement we just don't know
who's pulling the strings the president
mentioned
shadowy groups and then
the press tried to make him look like a
kook for saying that
but the truth is i don't think anybody
knows it's just
obvious that there's some kind of
organization behind the scenes
and i don't think it's a coincidence
that we don't see the leaders
the fact that we don't see the leaders
of these groups
and that they don't have a leadership
structure suggests that the real leaders
are hidden
and why would the real leaders be hidden
well
the obvious explanation is they're not
on our side if you know what i mean
all right
um high odds he gets covered soon
somebody's talking about well the
slaughter meter uh because of this
latest hoax which is a good one
i'd say that sets the slaughter meter
back to uh
i'd say 50
so uh and of course this won't last
you know there will be 50 more outrages
between now and
election day but the slaughter meter
only is a snapshot in time that
if things went the way they're going now
in other words if people believe
this losers and suckers hoax
that would take uh probably trump's
chances down by 50
it's that strong it's as strong as the
fine people hoax
and the fine people hoax is the only
reason
trump doesn't have a you know a massive
lead in just the polls it's the only
reason
because as i've told you before there
are lots of complaints about trump
but if you took away the fine people
hoax all of the other ones are only sort
of speculative
it's like well i i think he was thinking
this when he said that
or i think he had a bad feeling when he
suggested this
the fine people hoax is the only one
where people say i saw it with my own
eyes
i heard it with my own ears even though
they didn't they were
hoaxed by a by a fake edit
um somebody says now finally we're
talking treason and the death penalty
yeah there is something going on that
looks like professionals at work
trying to overthrow the country we just
don't know exactly
who's behind all that i don't even know
if they're americans
uh trump offers vp to biden
what that's the worst idea i've heard
today
what will the october surprise be you
know it's almost like we're running out
of surprises aren't we
uh oh yeah then biden shook hands when
he got off the plane
against all against all recommendations
all right that's all i got for you today
i will talk to you tomorrow
