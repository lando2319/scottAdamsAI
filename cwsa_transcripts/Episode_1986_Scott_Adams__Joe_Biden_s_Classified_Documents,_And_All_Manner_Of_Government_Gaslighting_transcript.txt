to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a finer moment in the
history of moments and if you'd like to
take it up
to a level it's hard to imagine well all
you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker jealous
of style the game team drug and flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
now if you were a member of the locals
subscription site
you've already seen three of my robots
read news cartoons that I
did today these are the ones that are
usually a little too rough for the
regular public well I'll read them to
you I think I can read them too
first one is that you know they're all
just so you know what it looks like
all of the robots we news are just the
same robot sitting at a desk reading the
news that the art never changes
uh but the robot says a satanic temple
heeded by dozens of gas ovens was
discovered in the basement of Joe
Biden's Delaware home
Biden spokes weasel reported that Biden
was quote surprised to learn of it
50 current and former Intel
professionals have labeled labeled it
quote obvious Russian trade craft
now also if you were uh if you happen to
be on the uh
if you happen if you have to be
um
I'm sorry I'm going to change my topic
here for a moment
I did a micro lesson which I talked
about choosing the right words
the word tradecraft is a perfect humor
word
so here's a little lesson on writing so
this uh I did a lesson on the the locals
Channel that's a subscription a lesson
about picking the right words and this
is just a perfect example the word
tradecraft
is unusual meaning it's not often used
in the sentence but it has a funny sound
and crift you know those are good sounds
for humor trade craft it's also a little
wonky
and it's also in the news lately so it
has a whole bunch of qualities that make
it the right the right word tradecraft
so that was the that was the first one
yeah let's see what else we got here
the second one was uh
a new study indicates Democrat
gaslighting causes asthma symptoms in
Republican voters a science denier in
the Biden Administration explained it
this way quote that's not asthma they
just do a lot of gasping for air when
they hear the we propose
all right and then finally
finally number three
robust renews representative Eric
swalwell got too close to an open flame
and went up in a giant Fireball
First Responders said it was the worst
case of gaslighting they have ever seen
scientists blamed climate change and
quote a universe that consistently
favors irony
so there you go three robots read news
jokes in one day
can I take the rest of the day off
are we good have I done enough for today
I mean that was all before
5 a.m I mean I don't know what you've
done today but I'm killing it I'm
killing it today
probably still a little bit uh
hypomaniacal
all right
um here's some well I like to call out
when any of my followers on Twitter or
on live stream when any of them have
like a success in their life
I like to call it out
don't you agree that's good to do you
have somebody has like a big moment in
their life I'd just like to give them a
little attention so I'd like to do that
today I saw a tweet from a user called
on Twitter he's called denles
as he announced this today I was really
happy for him he said the wife and I are
very excited we just closed escrow on a
dozen eggs
so congratulations to you
I know it's hard to get a loan like that
but uh proud owners of a dozen eggs and
uh given the price of eggs that's quite
an accomplishment and I
I respect the effort that you put into
that
speaking of inflation
apparently is cooling off
were you expecting that
let me do a quick informal survey
did you expect that inflation would keep
going up
or did you think it kind of capped and
was going to start to drift down
I expected it to cap and drift down
so so this can anybody confirm that I
said something like that earlier
can you confirm that I I said it
wouldn't go that much higher yeah it was
part of the Adam's law of uh of Slumber
living disasters
for some reason
when we can all see the same problem and
we've got enough time to work on it
we're really good at solving stuff it's
amazing
so I don't think inflation is going to
come down quickly
but it doesn't really need to
because you know it's it's doing two
things it's eating up the debt
well it's also you know strangling the
public
and the public needs both of those
things right the public needs the debt
to be a little bit strangled because
it's so high but they also need to eat
so it's a tough balance I think coming
down slowly
will build some confidence in the
economy and if you have confidence in
your economy
what works out
what what's the predictable outcome of
confidence in your economy
basically everything's better
just everything
so you'll you only need to be
directionally correct and if inflation
is drifting down even slowly it just has
to go in that direction
confidence will be up people will invest
it will make enough money to get out of
this maybe
so that's the good news
uh this new study that says sitting
causes excess mortality
so apparently sitting is really uh
deadly
which is
scary because I've been sitting in this
chair for now for
okay just kidding I didn't die
but wouldn't that be funny if I did I
think we could all agree that you could
laugh at that
can I make a deal with you
uh I'm gonna make a deal with all of you
in the in the unlikely event
that my death is hilarious
like it's ironic or like it's really
weird
I would like to authorize all of you to
enjoy it as much as you can because I'm
going to be dead either way
can you agree I mean if I'm dead you
might as well enjoy it but only if it's
interesting right and I just die of some
ordinarily ordinary comorbidity nobody
cares about that
but if I get a blood clot
you are authorized to enjoy the hell out
of that
you have you have my total approval and
when somebody calls you on it you point
them to this this Live cast and say he
said we could he's a professional it's
okay yeah I'm a professional so go nuts
well here's what I say about this
sitting thing so now we know that
sitting can kill you and it can give you
cardiac problems
we also see from a tweet from a Twitter
account called The Rabbit Hole
that uh 15 of men reported having no
close friends in 2021
in 1990 he was only three percent
so five times more lonely men than there
were just in 1990. 10 of women reported
having no close friends in 2021 and that
was only two percent in 1990.
so we got sitting in chairs
less exercise
we've got probably less sun because
people just didn't go outside as much
either probably
so people are obese
lonely and sitting in chairs more
and feeling hopeless yeah isolated
hopeless
and probably doing more drugs
wouldn't it be surprising if there were
not a huge increase in excess mortality
how could there not be
right now on top of that you've got any
uh vaccine problems
because no matter what you think of
vaccinations you call them shots the one
time I use the word vaccinations you'll
decide that's what I think they are so
clock birds will go crazy Club Birds
that's for you
I'll go through I guess I'm going to
throw the club Birds a little treat
I'm going to use the word vaccination
but this time I'm not going to correct
it because I want to see them go nuts
okay this is just for them
so the vaccinations might cause some
harm but also might might give some
people benefits
um so given all of those reasons
it's kind of understandable that there's
a big uptick in deaths
now the exact timing of the uptick
I'm not sure if we can trust the data of
course because all the data is bad
oh new study is that somebody says
breaking new studies 17 percent of kids
suffering cardiac symptoms after that
can't be true
really
if it's true there's 17 of kids were
having cardiac symptoms after the shot
70 percent
if that's true Pfizer would not only
you know have a legal problem
they would be executed
let me just say this
if it ever turned down I don't think
this will happen but if it ever turned
out
that you actually got the name of
somebody in big Pharma like an actual
person an executive let's say who knew
that who knew that statistic and hid it
that if that's not the death penalty I
don't know what is
seriously I mean that should be a public
execution and I'm not even joking
I'm not that's not a joke
I don't think this will ever be true
because I think what's true is I think I
think Pharma people convince themselves
they're not bad
what do you think
do you think the farmer people
are literally just saying if I lie lots
of people will die
but I can make a lot of money
I mean there are people who exist
of that nature
but I feel it's far more likely that
they convince themselves it's not as bad
as it looks
right they tell themselves well this
these numbers look bad but we better
double check them
I don't want to say anything until
they're double checked right you could
easily see Executives talking themselves
out of their own evil even while they do
things that you and I would say well
that's pretty evil
so I I kind of suspect that they would
have an argument
might be a weak one but they probably
have some argument
um however
if it turned out
that they were as exactly as bad as you
thought a public execution I mean it's
not in our legal code of course but a
public execution would feel about right
you know if somebody intentionally
murdered
I don't know thousands of children
nobody would complain about a public
execution except they're really prickly
people
all right um
so there's the app
I I saw a count on Twitter a woman who
was suggesting that porn be banned
online
because that's distorting people's
sexuality and how they act and causing
people to be worse people to each other
than perhaps they could is I guess the
argument
to which I say
what are the people who can't have sex
with real people supposed to do
why would you take away the only thing
they have
you realize that we're heading to a
point where only 10 or 20 percent of
humans are having sex at all
like I don't know what the percentage is
in general all right let me I'm going to
do a little survey
how many of you on let's say I'm not I'm
not going to ask I'm locals because I I
know too many of you too well
but on YouTube where you're a little bit
more anonymous
how many how many of you have not had
sex in a month
go
have not had sex in a month
one month
I think it's most I think it would be
the majority actually
yeah quite a few people now I don't know
what that is as a percentage because you
know there's no way to know but if I had
to put a number on it
at least half
probably at least half of all adults did
not have sex in the last month what's
your guess
I've never I've never looked into it but
I feel like it's at least half
because half of the people would be too
unhealthy anyway they're either you know
they're aged out or they're unhealthy or
their marriage isn't working out or
you know they're too busy something
yeah yeah I think I think it's common
for people to go to month without sex
more common than people having sex and I
think that number is going to go down to
like 10 or 20 percent are actually
having sex with other humans I think
that's where we're having slowly but I
think that's where it's going to go
because the rest will just not have an
option
so where we are at the moment is because
everybody has really good information
the beautiful people can find each other
and say wow you're beautiful I'm
beautiful let's do this
and then everybody below you know a
certain level of physical attractiveness
just won't have anything
so I mean that's where we're heading
already
so I would say getting rid of porn would
be very cruel to those who basically
don't have anything else to take care of
that particular
hormonal need
all right
I saw a tweet by Steve Malloy
who often talks about climate change and
he said this I think this is NASA
reporting it that climate shocker not a
single extreme weather record set in the
U.S during 2022 per
NOAA not NASA what's NOAA National
Organization of atmospheric
Association
or something
Oceanic
all right whatever it is some
governmental group
has said that there was not a single
weather record in the U.S
I don't believe that view
do you believe there was no record in
the U.S
I'm
that doesn't sound right
does it
maybe there's something like a a
national average or something that
didn't set a record but don't we set
records at least in some town
like every month
aren't there records out almost every
day at least somewhere
so I'm not sure what it means to not set
a record maybe they have very specific
things they're tracking such as
hurricanes or extreme high temperatures
or something
but I don't know
so it says no record temperatures for
rain snow or wind
I'm not buying that
but maybe on average it wasn't any worse
if it if it were no worse on average
then then that's a good point
all right yesterday I was flipping
through
Instagram
and I saw a video uh that mockingly
suggests 911 wasn't what you thought and
it was the big conspiracies theory they
don't say who did it obviously our
government but nothing more specific
now what if I told you about seeing
documentaries
on one side
super persuasive
because if you only see one side of an
argument
well what are you supposed to think now
so so this was a brilliant one side of
the argument presentation and by that I
mean when it was done
I was convinced that 9 11 was an inside
job
it was very persuasive
now
here's here's the thing you need to know
five minutes later
if somebody debunked that do you know
what I would say
probably
oh well that's a pretty good debunk okay
nothing there
so my level of certainty that I got from
it is wholly unrelated to reality
it has only everything to do with the
fact that documentaries in this case a
little video that was a one-sided thing
they're super persuasive that thing was
terribly persuasive and then you put
that in the
in the context
of not believing anything the
government's told you and watching our
government literally run conspiracy
theories I mean the actual schemes
that look like conspiracy theories then
they get caught
so given that we know our government is
not above that they have a history of
doing it
um the the 911 situation does look
different if you if you pull it Forward
into today's context it looks completely
different
yeah and the approach that this video
used which was really good
otherwise
they mocked each part of it
so they'd say stuff like yes a guy with
just a satellite phone and a cave in
Afghanistan pulled off the most
complicated operation in the history of
the world and one of the one of the
pilots who couldn't even pass a Cessna
flying test managed to do one of the
most complicated Maneuvers a a giant
Jack could ever do to hit to hit the
Pentagon at exactly the time that they
had said they were missing a few
trillion dollars and it coincidentally
blew up all the records of the Lost
trillion dollars
now if you do a fact check on that I
don't believe I don't believe the that
the plane hit
and destroyed
yes on September 10th they were
reporting that 2.3 trillion went missing
and on September 11th their building
blew up
now I'm not laughing at the chat the
tragedy I'm laughing at the fact that if
anything ever looked like a conspiracy
theory that was true it's got all the
markings of it now
but it's funny how if if you just looked
at it in the context
of 2001
the conspiracy theorists just looked
nuts
if you look at it in the context of
today
it's pretty good theory it's a solid
Theory
now I'm not saying it's true all right
so this is one of those things that if I
tweeted about it
well actually I no I didn't tweet about
it if I tweeted about it the clot Birds
would say he believes this Theory
because it'd be fun and entertaining but
the club Birds only see things out of
context so they only see they always say
yeah this by the way question
I've been asked a number of times if I
would do a spaces
uh event on Twitter
and I haven't really been too interested
because I got enough going on anyway
but I did think it might be fun
just to have people uh
let's see what would you say accost me
with my own past tweets and asked me to
explain them
say are you saying this or that because
they're all easy to explain they just
take more than a tweet to explain so I
feel like I feel like letting all the
clubbers just wildly you know pile on me
in public would be fun
what do you think would that be fun
and I suppose I could live stream
you know my participation it just
wouldn't be good audio
yeah well you know you wouldn't have to
attend but
um I
my proposition is I would just go right
into the snake pit I just sort of
lowered myself into the snake pit and
see if I can get out
I might be a little too cocky but
I'm pretty sure I could get out of that
pretty easily meaning that yeah
everything I said I stand by
people are pulling all of my past tweets
to embarrass me and they keep tweeting
them and I keep looking at my past
tweets and saying
now that's exactly what I thought
what's the problem
so all right maybe I'll do that maybe
I'll do a spaces
um
well let's talk about those Biden
classified documents now we know that
there are at least two places
I was a Greg gotfeld who was saying
those bidens like to leave leave
important things everywhere
we've got you know Hunter Biden's
laptops are spread all over the world
and Joe Biden apparently is just
dropping trade seek or government
secrets wherever he goes
uh we got you know Ashley Biden's diary
I feel like the bidens are not good with
Secrets not not good with secrets
here's what uh CNN's Stefan Collinson
says and I love the the effort
that the Democrats are putting into this
trying to make a you know do the best
they can to you know weaken the
criticism all right listen to this
sentence from Stephen colinson now you
should know that he's uh he's got a long
track record of being a mostly an
anti-trump opinion person on CNN yeah he
writes this while Trump's retention of
hundreds of documents and attempts to
thwart their transfer to the National
Archives as required by law appears more
serious at this stage
really
the Mar-A-Lago documents which we don't
know what the contents were
seems more serious
than the Biden documents that we don't
know what the contents are
what
that doesn't matter what the contents
are how can you say what is more that's
ridiculous that is so patently
ridiculous how can you take that
seriously
it's ridiculous
now I think the argument has to do with
uh Trump was uh wasn't resisting
you know the government's attempts to
get him back
but two things are worth noting
Trump was claiming they were personal
property
and he was President he could he could
declassify anything
now you could argue that you know he
shouldn't have or he didn't but that's a
pretty weak problem
compared to whatever it might be in
bidencing now I would be equally equally
wrong if I said the Biden stuff looks
more
damaging than Trump stuff because
they're both complete unknowns complete
unknowns
but nobody is suggesting that Biden's
documents
were something he thought that he owned
because he didn't have any right to
declassify anything as vice president
um
yeah well
um here's things we know
the University of Pennsylvania
uh got way more Chinese funding for the
the school in general
when Biden opened his little uh office
there his Think Tank ironically and of
course the University of Pennsylvania
says no no no
uh Biden didn't get any money from China
that did not happen what happened was
when Biden showed up there was a huge
increase in money from China to the
university
which then made it the University's
money not Chinese money and then the
university took the money that used to
be Chinese money but it's definitely not
China's money because they gave it to
the University of Pennsylvania which
changes it from China's money into
University of Pennsylvania's money and
then they give it to Joe Biden which now
changes them to Joe Biden's money so
really nobody is to blame
because once they gave it to Joe Biden
it was his money
so there's nothing to see her
all of it is so stupid it's like
incredibly stupid and this is clearly
how the bidens were laundering
corruption
clearly
but it's all legal as far as I can tell
as far as I can tell if you do it right
it's totally legal and I think that's
what Hunter Biden was doing for them he
was doing a bunch of things that were
sketchy but clear just totally legal
so here's how you legally take a bribe
you ready
I will not take a bribe from you come on
take a bribe I will not take a bribe
from you I will not do it all right darn
it we tried to give you a bribe
so uh
you got any relatives who need funding
a friend or a business acquaintances oh
yes I have plenty of friends and
business acquaintances who have
businesses that are looking for
investment yes but that has nothing to
do with me
is one of them your brother
who shares 10 with you maybe but that
has nothing to do with me
well maybe we'll talk to your brother
and make an enormous investment that we
wouldn't normally make
now would you like to do what we say
don't ask again and don't put that in
writing
it's obvious corruption
now correct me if I'm wrong
Trump has never even come close to
anything like that has he
is anything in the Trump World even
close to what is obviously corruption
obviously
like obviously
you know if if all of the trips with
Hunter weren't enough if all the barisma
stuff wasn't if that were not enough I
mean there's no doubt anymore
the the weird thing about these stories
is because all the the hunter stories
trickled out
and then this story is kind of trickling
out
that it's giving us time to get used to
it
we shouldn't get used to this
is completely obvious corruption
completely obvious
now I don't think you need to know
anything any extra stuff do you
with trump it was always if we keep
digging we're going to find something
right they never said we found it they
said if we keep digging we're going to
find you know some stuff and then they
dog and never found anything but with
Biden do you need to do any digging
now the public reported stuff
tells the whole story there's no
confusion there no ambiguity whatsoever
is very clearly corruption it just
doesn't seem to be illegal because the
Chinese know how to do it
in a way that is legal
so I don't think anybody's going to go
to jail for that stuff but uh and
probably won't even have any effect on
the on re-election
that's the weird thing Democrats
absolutely won't care
absolutely won't care
all right uh Rasmussen is talking about
the Border situation did a poll and
found out that uh 69 of likely U.S
voters believe the current situation
with migrants at the U.S Mexico border
is a crisis
69 percent believe it's a crisis
um and which is even higher than it was
in May
now how do you get reelected
when 69 percent of the public
thinks you blew one of the biggest
problems I mean
border security should have been a gimme
in every other country
border security is something they can
get done apparently but we can't
I mean it's the one thing you should
have been able to depend on our
government to do like just build a wall
you know guard it
but we didn't
so now 69 percent of the people think
it's a crisis and we've got a government
that clearly is not super interested in
fixing it
so how in the world does he get
reelected
it's amazing
yeah they blame I guess they blame
Republicans
all right
um Michael schellenberger is reporting
more on the Twitter files
um
many he said in a tweet many think
social media companies only censored
vaccine misinformation
uh clotberts when I said the word
vaccine that's actually a quote from a
tweet had I used the word vaccine
you should start yelling my God don't
you know it's not a vaccine my God is
not a vaccine why do you keep supporting
the vaccine Scott now it's just a quote
settle down it's just a quote
and it's in quotes
it's a quote
about a quote
so it's like a double quote
so don't blame me
um
anyway apparently they were also uh
trying to censor stuff that was accurate
and they said so directly
because some of the accurate information
was damaging to the narrative
they said it directly it's actually in
the in the emails I guess Dr Scott
Gottlieb was one of the ones asking now
here's the context
the contact says I think because they
were a little unclear about what the
what the true information they wanted to
stop was I think it's probably the
anecdotes
so I think the the quote true
information they were trying to block
probably was lots of people saying look
at this person
they got the shot and then they dropped
dead
because that would actually be somewhat
consistent with what the official people
were saying which is that sometimes
you're going to drop dead
we got to do that
because that's true with you know
medicines and vaccinations in general
somebody's going to drop that we just
didn't know
no that's a foreign consent everybody
who got a shot
should have known there was a risk of
death
and that was pretty basic knowledge by
the time you got it you should have
known
but
that's pretty basic knowledge we just
don't know how many so what do you think
of this
so here's your ethical question I think
I know which way you're going to go
suppose you were an official in charge
of trying to save the country
from this coronavirus and suppose you do
that every time somebody put out one of
these anecdotes of this one person died
after getting vaccinated that the
anecdotes are not science they're just
things people saw we already knew that
people would have bad outcomes
and the only point of it was that maybe
not having the shots would be even worse
that was the thinking
so
um
anyway so I think that the the moral
argument for trying to block the true
stories is that they would be misleading
because uh people can't tell the
difference between an anecdote and a
study
do you agree that individual stories of
people
could be terribly misleading
and that if it caused people to make
the wrong medical choice that they would
die because that misleading information
so do you think that the social media
platforms
should err on the side of being letting
everything that's true Beyond
even if it causes massive people to die
should they go with a free speech
knowing it would kill people
I mean you it would kill people for sure
I don't know many but it would
definitely kill people
so so most of you say with free speech
and let them die now is there any is
there a limit to that is there any upper
limit so let's say I said uh a hundred
thousand people died
so you could have your free speech on
social media
are you okay with that would you accept
100 000 American deaths
for no censorship
right I I respect those answers so I'm
saying a sea of yeses on the locals
platform yes yes yes yeah that that's
how serious we take Free Speech oh
seriously
and
I'm okay with that
I'm okay with that yeah I would agree
with you I guess
because it's two impossible choices
isn't it
you can't be I don't think you can make
the moral choice
you can't make the moral choice because
there's two immoral choices
that's it but here's what you can do
and I I've I've
probably modeled this a number of times
but here's why you would choose free
speech
because that protects the system
and that's more important than a hundred
thousand lives
we've proven it a million times
if the United States lost free speech
that's going to cost you more than a
hundred thousand lives you just have to
wait a little while am I right
a hundred thousand lives unfortunately
is cheap
that's the worst thing I'll ever say
right this is the worst thing ever come
out of my mouth
that a hundred thousand Souls you know
dying a horrible death
is cheap
but compared to losing free speech in
American specifically
probably is it's probably cheap
it's probably cheap
so I'd agree with you on that
all right uh
foreign
to you
that there's the Democrats are
gaslighting us about literally gas
stoves
like what were the odds that that would
happen
I mean that just feels
so simulationy it's like we all we all
cause that to happen just by thinking
about the puns
like I feel like we caused it to happen
lately it wasn't going to happen on its
own
but that is just too weird that the
anyway
um Andreas Backhouse looked at the
little study that seemed to indicate
that indoor gas stoves of course that's
where they usually are uh was causing uh
asthma
and this is what Andre says uh he said
the the gas stoves and childhood asthma
research is a three-pager
that does one calculation and presents
one figure based on a meta-analysis
coefficient and aggregate data from nine
U.S states
and as Andres sums it up
let's hope no policies will be based on
this paper despite the overblown
attention it is receiving now
do you still are you still angry at
Andres for criticizing all bad studies
you do see he goes after just all the
bad studies it has nothing to do with
the topic of the study he's one of the
few people
that I've seen go through the entire
pandemic
and I can even identify a bias
I'm not sure he has them because he's
human but I haven't seen one I haven't
seen one he's just he's just a maniac
about bad studies and letting you know
when they're bad now that doesn't mean
that this uh
study is wrong
it just means it's not
credible enough to act on it might turn
out to be right you know maybe it's the
first one and then they repeat it or
they replicate it maybe it could be
but it gets back to how important
ventilation is if we had better
ventilation the kids wouldn't have
asthma if we had better ventilation
covid would not have been as spready as
it is kids going back to school so we
really need to get serious about
ventilation
I'm going to add to my prediction
that the biggest Market of the future is
people completely getting rid of their
classic old
old kind of homes and building homes
that are more livable and one of the
things you could do today that you could
get right is making the ventilation way
way better
so that's just one of the things
bad ventilation equals energy efficient
yeah there's that
all right um
are you ready for the greatest moral
conundrum
you've ever heard
this was going to make your head just go
rot
all right so uh Democrats are in favor
of abortion correct
correct Democrats are very strong
supporters as am I of the lgbtq
community
it would be hard to be more supportive
than I am
very supportive
um
Republicans may be a little less so but
I think you know in 2023 it's not really
even the topic they care about mostly
um
now fact Jack
it is uh widely understood
there's a consensus view of this in the
medical medical and I think social
community in general that um being gay
will just pick one part of lgbtq that
being gay
is a something you're born
now I'm sure there's some debate some
people probably say no but would you
agree with the the setup here the setup
for my moral conundrum is that it's
widely understood
that you're essentially born gay of
course there's a environmental Factor
you know you could imagine that there's
some gray area where the environment
flips you one way or the other but
generally
generally most gay people are born
without wiring wouldn't you say
now at the moment I don't believe
science can study a baby's DNA and
determine they're gay there's not it's
not like there's a gay gene you know yes
no it's more like a complicated
let's say web of connections
and a variety of connections might be
able to get you to the same place
right so it's a little little not quite
understood
what exactly is happening in a in a
person that that predisposes them to be
gay
but
don't you think we're going to figure
that out
do you think in 20 years we won't know
that a baby will become gay
I think we will know
I think we'll just keep honing in on it
until we say oh okay if these five
factors are here it's you know 95 chance
it's going to be gay don't you think oh
some of you say no you think we'll never
get to the point
where we could untangle the complexity
that predisposes somebody to be gay
okay well some of you are going to
disagree with the Assumption then so
I'll let you take a pass and you don't
have to answer this because you've you
basically you tested out of this
question by saying you don't you really
think that won't happen
I'm really surprised that you think
that's not an obvious thing that will
happen I think it'll obviously happen
all you have to do is take everything we
know about a person
and turn AI loose on it
just say here's everything we know
everything every blood test every you
know chromosome every every part of your
DNA
and then they'll just say hey AI look at
all the people who have given us all
this information and tell us what you
can find and see if you could predict
I would put a very big bet
that you'll be able to predict with
let's say 95 accuracy that a baby will
grow up to be predisposed to be a gay
man
you don't think so now is it because you
think it's not genetic
you're saying epigenetic meaning a combo
all right well let me finish my finish
my question
what happens when Republicans start
aborting gay fetuses
will abortion remain legal
you say that will not happen no that
would happen
[Laughter]
oh that would happen I wouldn't do it
but it's going to happen
right
yeah now I I agree with you that mostly
it wouldn't happen
mostly it wouldn't happen
but somebody's going to do it
you don't think that they'll be maybe
it's not even Republicans maybe it's not
even Republicans maybe it's just anybody
who's a they get anybody who thinks it's
you know going to cause them problems
maybe they're selfish or something right
but you don't think there's somebody is
going to start trying to abort gay
fetuses
right you're you're way more trusting
than I am
I don't know how you got so trusting
all right well I thought you were going
to agree with my assumptions but since
you disagree with the assumptions it
turns out that wasn't much of a moral
dilemma at all
I guess Republicans will just say let
all babies be born
and Democrats will have a different View
all right well okay let me let me take a
moment here to complement
my conservative leaning audience you
know I don't identify as conservative
but I always appreciate people who are
consistent
with their View and I just saw an
amazing amount of consistency there so
good for you it's actually kind of
impressive how consistent you are even
even at the hardest question you remain
consistent
I I do respect that I gotta say I
respect that so
um
turns out that uh
foreign
missed a deadline
for reporting the uh
the what is it that
the cardio problems from the shop on
young people
did is that breaking that I just saw did
they just while I was on the live stream
did Pfizer just announce the results
can you confirm that or was somebody
just guessing they did somebody says yes
and the re and the results are
horrible
is anybody looking at it right now
uh breaking it's heart stopping
so is that the biggest news at the
moment they're just admitting that it's
bad for young young males mostly
is that now just something that Pfizer
says right straight out
wow okay well so the note I made to
myself is that um if Pfizer is not
giving us the results and we don't know
why you have to assume there's a reason
I guess that was the reason it was
exactly what you thought huh
yeah I got a feeling that good news
comes out right away
when you miss your deadline for
something that could be really bad
but not necessarily
I think missing the deadline you presume
guilt
remember a company is not a person and
the government is not a person
persons have the Assumption of Innocence
big organizations you have to start with
the Assumption of a guilt and if they
don't offer you transparency just keep
your assumption just assume guilt and
and act as though that's just a fact
that's the only system that works you
know trusting big organizations who are
not transparent makes no sense at all
you couldn't have a world that way
well the uh we'll talk more about the
Pfizer stuff when I know more about it
so there's another Russian general
shake-up I think the fourth one since
the the military action
and in Ukraine so the new guy so the
speculators are all speculating so the
new general
was already the top general of all the
generals
but he was more of an office kind of a
general
and
yeah you're already assuming that I'm
going to be biased toward one side
give me a minute give me a minute will
you
so some pundits say that one of them is
getting demoted and it's a sign of
things going wrong Etc
the other take is that he's exactly the
right guy
to have him position for a spring
offensive that the Russians are getting
rid of are getting ready for
I I lean toward that view
that it's a positive Uh Russian strategy
I'm leading against the interpretation
that it shows that Russia is falling
apart
because the person they're putting in
charge was the office person in charge
of the generals who were there and they
just told the office person to get out
of the office and get to the front line
or at least get into the war
and the thinking is that the person who
any and he still he has the same job so
he's still ahead of the other generals
but if that General can get the various
um parts of the Russian military to work
together better which was one of the
biggest issues they had then he's
exactly the right person
and and if he's ahead of the generals
and he's not doesn't have let's say the
urgency that he should then putting him
into theater would certainly give him
more urgency
so it's way too early to know if this is
a good thing or a bad thing
and then what way but I'm leaning toward
uh it's a it's a Russian strong move and
they're getting ready for a big
offensive in the spring
is that what you expected me to say
because you expected me to say over and
over again
that you crave is winning everything
even when the evidence suggests
otherwise
see sometimes I follow the evidence
to me that doesn't look like a mistake
it looks like they strengthened their
chain the command
by the way
by the way I I was on YouTube yesterday
and YouTube suggested a uh story about
Stalin
it was a story about the last days of
Stalin
and oh my God
I think we all knew that Stalin was you
know a Healer like
bad character
I had no idea I thought I knew how bad
it was
I did not know I did not know at all
he was actually
basically just a serial killer who
enjoyed killing people
he actually just liked it
he killed most of his in-laws
he he was mad at his wife because she
committed suicide when she figured out
what a monster is
so because he was mad at his wife who
killed herself
he sent most of her relatives
to the gulags and shot the guys
you know one by one not all at once
the the sister of one of the sisters who
went to the gulag just for being a
sister and you know complaining that
about her sister the one went had a
meeting with him and and just gave a
letter from the sister that was in the
gulag you know asking for mercy
and so instead of giving her mercy he
transferred her to a much worse gulag
and then took the sister who complained
and delivered the letter and somebody
knew like a family member and put her in
the gulag
and then you know executed her later
and that's and that's not like a rare
story apparently that was every day like
he had a huge list of people he was
executing he executed uh 750
000 people in like one year
750 000. 20 million he killed altogether
well I you know
as crazy as you know our other dictators
are I've never seen anything like that
because it it did seem like he was
enjoying it it did not seem like
like you thought it was necessary
necessarily
well you never know I mean any story
about dictators is shaky
um
and that ladies and gentlemen is all I
needed to say today is there any story I
missed we'll check out that Pfizer stuff
oh uh I tweeted a long thread from a
professor
Baloo
I like all of your opinion on it because
he coincidentally he represents my exact
opinion of where the consensus of
experts are on the data
now you all understand I didn't say that
that means I'm right
but my current belief subject to change
at any time
is that his description of of whether
the so-called vaccinations helped or
hurt
is at least consistent with the data
that we can see and basically he's
saying that of the vulnerable group
the older people primarily
that it was wildly successful like
wildly successful saving lives not in
terms of infections but he said
everybody should have known it wouldn't
help with infections you know spread
because
yeah it should have been obvious that's
that's the reason I predicted it
wouldn't work
because never worked before and again it
didn't work this time
but his take his take is that even at
the beginning it was probably a bad idea
to give the shots to young people young
healthy people
and he and he's saying that's what looks
to be the case that it was a mistake to
give it to young people but that it was
a huge success
to give it to the older people
how many of you think that's true
and again I'm just saying that matches
my current thinking of what the current
thinking is my own thinking
my own thinking is useless because
you know how do I know I'm just saying
by thinking of what the current thinking
is matches that
until Omicron and then you think it
changed
yeah I'm not aware of any data that
would be
um counter to his his view of what the
career view is I haven't seen any but
that doesn't mean it's not true
now I would agree with you on the
following statement
in the in the context of Omicron
I don't know why anybody would get
any you know any additional things put
in their body
I mean I'm not you know I did that I did
a minimum I needed to fly and then I'm
out
so
um but if you if you were to stop today
was the shot wildly successful at
protecting old people so far now that
doesn't mean they won't fall over
tomorrow
so some so this is uh two movies one
screen right it's this would you agree
that it's the single most important
thing to know
like if you could know one thing for
sure
wouldn't you want to know if the
vaccinated had a much better chance of
living than the unvaccinated and like
and be confident of the numbers yeah
it's the most important thing
and we don't agree on it and we don't
agree
all right so I will accept anybody who
disagrees with the data because all of
our data has turned out to be unreliable
so far
so if you're if you just take the
position all of our data is fake
you're going to be right a lot
I'm not even going to argue with you
but it's entirely possible that that
will end up being the
historian's take on it I think the
historians are going to settle on the
vaccination saved lives but it was a
mistake to give it to the young where it
probably costs lives
I think that's where it's going to turn
out but that doesn't mean it's true
right that just means that's I think
that's where the historians are going to
settle
we'll never know what's true
all right
uh no is the default answer until proven
yes oh let me test this logic with you
generally speaking would you agree with
the following statement
don't do a medical intervention
if you don't know you need it
how many I believe would say that's
that's just basic don't do a medical
intervention
if you don't know you need it
yeah
yeah you're all wrong by the way the
every one of you got the wrong answer
totally wrong
is there anybody who's going to disagree
with you am I the only one no that's
totally bad thinking that's bad analysis
right the The Fog of War decision is
completely different
the fog of War decision
is if you think you have a
a a weaponized biological weapon
and that's one of your choices you know
it's fog of War you don't know what this
thing is and then on the other hand
people on your side ish the form of
people in the government you know sort
of on your side are saying you know we
don't know for sure but this looks like
a better bet than this
do you think just automatically don't
put anything in your body under any
condition
all right how about this
suppose you get uh uh bit by a wild
animal
and you don't know yet if you have
rabies
you don't know
do you get the rabies shot yes or no you
don't know if you have rabies
oh you all changed your opinion look at
that every one of you just reversed your
opinion now suddenly you're putting
you're putting drugs into your body
you're putting drugs into your body
without knowing without knowing if you
have a problem
now are you going to say to me that's a
special case
you should right you should say that's
the special case right
so is the fog of War
so was this this was the most special
case
now it's not exactly
let me let me be consistent analogies
are not arguments
so if I were to say because you know
because of one kind of shot they treat
it that way therefore you know and other
shots should be treated that doesn't
make sense analogies don't work that way
right so if you're saying bad analogy
yay you should be saying that the
analogy is just to bring your mind to
something it's not an argument it's just
to bring your mind to another place or
to explain something right no argument
here's the argument
in a special case
which would be rare
you you can consider both options and
you're not crazy
right and if you're trying to avoid
maybe a Chinese bio weapon
and your option is a let's say
a drug made by people who are less
likely to want you dead
do you take the one for people trying to
kill you or the ones from the people
trying to save you but maybe they did it
wrong or they're lying to you
right yeah so
so I'll just make one statement
if the
if the uh rabies thing didn't convince
you
is that didn't convince you
the only thing I want to tell you is
there are exceptions
but as a general rule I agree with you
as a general rule don't put something in
your body if you don't know it's going
to help you or has a good chance
yeah and every every day we put alcohol
in our bodies and all kinds of stuff
somebody needs me to reframe a
McDonald's McMuffin Addiction in the
morning
what's wrong with the McMuffin
of all the things you could eat isn't
that one of the less bad ones at least
there's an egg in there right
isn't McMuffin bad for you
yeah well you know the bread but
like having a little bit of bread isn't
going to kill you
yeah okay well I'm not sure you need
that but if I were looking to reframe it
the way I would do it is that I would
call it entertainment
so if you're eating it because it tastes
so darn good which is probably the case
because you have options you know there
are other ways to eat so you're probably
eating because it tastes good if you're
eating it because it tastes good it's
entertainment
so tell yourself
you don't need entertainment
you need food
so try that one
so that's Entertainment fast food you
should think of as entertainment in
general
right junk food all junk food is
entertainment
so if you're hungry do you say oh I'm
hungry I need some entertainment
no when you're hungry go get some food
get some protein first you know eat
clean and then go from there
um
no way it's good for you well Rel you
know unfortunately we live in a world
where our options are things that are
terrible for us and things that are just
bad for us
uh or you're going to spend a lot of
money and a lot of time
you know growing your own organic food
or something
yeah I don't think there's any food that
hasn't been called bad for you at one
point
yeah I don't know well don't take my
advice on
eating at McDonald's
but I would guess that on the McDonald's
menu I'm gonna guess the Egg McMuffin is
the least bad for you thing for you
just a guess I have no data to back that
up
all right
ladies and gentlemen I'm going to say
goodbye to YouTube
and thanks for joining best live stream
you've ever seen
