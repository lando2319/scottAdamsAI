man this is a good book
whoa i can't put it down that's only
because i glued my hand to it i
i actually can't put it down it's just
stuck with my hand
well i hope you have your copy i'm still
uh
in new york city on a weird time zone
but i'm flying back today so tomorrow's
coffee with scott adams at the correct
time
thank you very much this time zone stuff
is difficult but there is one thing
that can make it better if your day
isn't
perfect yet try the simultaneous
sip it's coming up and you can get ready
for it
by grabbing a cup mug glass
stein chalice tankard
shot glass canteen vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better
the simultaneous sip go
feel the connectedness with everybody
around the world
our energy is connected it is one
it is one so as you know
i'm on in the middle of my book tour for
loser think that just came out it's uh
it's making a big impact so far it's the
weirdest experience i have to say
the the odd thing about my life is that
uh i've got three or four different
things
that people are independently becoming
fans of or consumers of and so when i
travel now
people will come up to me and say oh i
love your book
god's debris from 15 years ago or
i love dilbert or i love one of your new
books or i love your periscope
but the weird thing is there are a lot
of people who only consume one of those
things
so i'm having this weird
semi-rock star experience here when i
meet people who like
one of those things so some of them are
some somebody's saying it's a humble
brag it's not a humble brag
i'm just bragging there's nothing humble
about this
let me point you to a chapter in my book
uh
loserthink let's see
this is a perfect example of how to use
this book
so somebody just said humblebrag i know
you were
half joking but let me show you how to
use this book
so you look up in this case the section
on ego
which would be on page if
i could do all right here it is looks
like page
35 and if you went there
you would find out i have a chapter
called the ego problem and how you
should treat your ego as a
tool you should treat it as something
you can
dial up and dial down it's not who you
are
so i'm not the guy who brags and i'm not
the guy
who sometimes says humble things
but i do both of those things it's just
that the situation calls for one
sometimes it calls for the other and let
me tell you when you're on
book tour should you dial up your ego
or should you dial it down well it's
delicate you don't want to go too far
but book tour is no time to be
modest it's no time to be modest
you're not going to sell a book if
you're modest you got to say this is a
good book now
the fact is people are saying it's my
best book so
we'll see
let's talk about some other things by
the way
you will be seeing me on greg guffield
show
tonight um
and i can guarantee you it's lit
[Laughter]
it's gonna be a good it's gonna be
i think i can almost guarantee you
maybe the best show ever so watch the
greg gutfeld show tonight
fox news
so don junior on the view um i only saw
some clips from it
um you know i i look at something that's
meant for entertainment such as a show
like the view and they know how to
produce entertainment
so if you mix the hosts of the view with
don jr
throw in a kimberly guilfoyle that's a
good show
that is a really good show
it's uh uh remind me to answer your
question
are your teeth real somebody just asked
me
um so i don't know what they you know
what did they think they were going to
get you throw don jr
into that situation and he's he's not
going to roll over
he's not going to be he's going to give
him a show
so the whoever books
the guests on the show great job
great job on that because you got some
good entertainment you got lots of
viewers and you can't take any of it too
seriously
all right so when don jr is down
promoting his book which by the way
um is out at the same time called
triggered
i believe triggered i think it's
probably the number one book probably
if it doesn't i'm sure it will be and
uh he puts on a good show and the the
hosts of the view put on a good show and
he put him together and
it's just a good show there's nothing
else that's important
about what they talked about in my
opinion but they're all talented they
put on a good show
let's talk about the world oh about my
teeth
so uh um i do
sometimes in public get complimented for
my teeth
now there's veneers which means that
what you're seeing is a
basically something put over the
original teeth
they are expensive but
if you can afford it they're they're
pretty worth it because they
they do have a big impact one of the
things that
um straight teeth do especially if
they're white
is um
one of the things they uh do is they
make you look a little younger
because your teeth are kind of a
giveaway for age
so it's a good thing to do if you're in
the public eye
it's just part of the job all right um
let's talk about china this is a
story in the national review and when
you just when you think china can't get
any worse
it's like you know china is a great
country yeah we should be friends
yeah sure they they send fentanyl over
here and they kill
50 000 americans a year with their
fentanyl but you know otherwise
you know they're pretty good china's
pretty solid well you know
they're they're reneging on hong kong
and they're looking to oppress them
when they said they wouldn't but yeah
yeah you can let that go that's that's a
small thing
otherwise china's pretty solid
well unless you count the fact that
they're massively trying to steal
everybody's
intellectual property um you know that's
not cool
but but otherwise good
solid country now well
when i say a solid country i'm not
counting the fact that they're
apparently using the flan falloongong
followers for spare body parts and
killing them on demand
and selling their organs but if you
don't count that
china is a very respectable
great place well
not counting the fact that they're
they're rounding up the uyghurs
minority and putting them in
concentration camps
but if you don't count that and the
fentanyl murders
weapons of mass destruction the the
oppression of hong kong
um the using the uh falun gong
people for body parts 10 to 70 million
of them
we don't know how many they'll use but
you know that plus the concentration
camps
but that's not much today we learn
that apparently china is assigning a
ethnic chinese
replacement husbands
for the wives of the uyghurs
who the the male has gone off to a
concentration camp
do you even hear that that's right
the china is assigning a rapist
for the families where the where the
father has been taken to
a concentration camp let me say that
again
china is assigning a rapist
to every household where the
of the uyghurs where the man has uh
been put in the concentration camp so
they put in this
this assigned ethnic chinese rapist
and he sleeps with the wife
and uh he tries to re-educate the family
so that they're re-educated while the
husband's in the concentration camp
possibly being used for parts
now somebody says show me the proof
that's exactly what you should say if
when somebody says something like
i just said show me the proof
right that's a fair thing to say
that's what i've been saying for i don't
know a couple of years
when people said china was using the
falun gong
folks for parts and killing them on
demand
and selling their organs i thought well
that's not true
that's ridiculous you know maybe it's
based on some anecdote or they used to
do it or something
but the evidence apparently is pretty
pretty solid
and when i say pretty solid it's a
hundred percent
there's no doubt about it they're doing
that so when i say the story
that they're assigning a rapist a
full-time rapist
not not one rape not one rape
he's assigned to live with the wife
of of the you know whose husband went
off to the concentration camp it's
mind-boggling and
so that's that's the situation now
is that worse similar to
or less than the actual holocaust
because remember i always say don't
compare anything to the holocaust
because there's nothing like it don't
compare anything to american slavery
because there's nothing like it they
just sort of stand on their own as
as distinct evils that you should never
compare anything to
but china is using for body parts a
group that has 10 to 70 million people
in it plus the entire uyghur population
i don't know how many there are but
there are a lot
and i would think that in the long run
china's going to
set the record and i don't mean it a
good way
so that's bad all right let's talk about
something else
that's what everybody else is gonna do
everybody else is gonna look the other
way and say
yeah i hear there's a mega holocaust
going on in china but
i'm hungry let's go to lunch um
so bloomberg is teasing about getting
into the race
uh i'm going to continue my prediction
that bloomberg will not get into the
race in the end
but you might ask yourself scott
if you think he's not going to get into
the race
why is he making so much noise about it
he could easily put in a statement
no i do not want to get in the race but
he hasn't
why would bloomberg want to tease that
he's getting into the race
without actually getting into the race
what would be a strategy
where that would make sense now if he
were someone else i'd say oh it's just
to get attention
you know maybe it's to build up his
business or something but that really
wouldn't work in his case
and he's you know multi-billionaire he
doesn't need any of that
so why would he do it
um i'm seeing watching your comments
i'm seeing lots of pretty smart guesses
but i haven't seen the right one yet
now i don't know if it's the right one
i'm just going to give you my
speculation
all right when when you hear me say it
i'm seeing lots of guesses but nobody's
quite yet the one i'm going to say yet
are you ready for this
he's doing it to take biden out
because bloomberg and biden would be
somewhat close to the same positions
what's the one thing that will take
biden out will it be
that he falls in the polls
maybe but you can't really count on it
because biden just keeps floating up
there no matter what he does
so if you're a bloomberg and you said to
yourself my god
we can't send biden out against trump
it'll be a slaughter
don't you think bloomberg knows because
all the democrats know at this point
that if they send biden out against
trump
there was no point in even having an
election there would be no point in
having the election there would just be
a done deal
so how do you take biden out
you can't really ask him to quit because
it's just up to him and obviously he
wants to run
listen i think somebody said it funding
there you go somebody got it
if you were a money person
and you were thinking about giving money
to joe biden
but at the same time there was a serious
rumor that bloomberg was going to get
into the race
do you still give money to joe biden
no you kind of delay you might in the
end
but as long as bloomberg is teasing run
why would you waste your money because
if bloomberg gets in
you you'd probably say okay there goes
biden
because you know bloomberg's sort of an
improved biden
same age but you know he's a little bit
more in the ball
so no i'm not saying that uh let me be
clear i'm not saying that the people who
donate money
would donate to bloomberg instead i'm
saying they would just
not bother donating to biden because he
wouldn't
he wouldn't be as attractive a candidate
and i think blindness
is kind of teetering on the edge
that if his funding goes down another i
don't know 10 or 20 percent
just pick a number um that might be
enough to say okay this won't work
i'm moving in the wrong direction so
biden
only only needs to see his funding
shrinking every week
it doesn't have to shrink by a lot to
know that it's not going to work out for
him
so it could be that bloomberg's play
is just to freeze the donors
so they don't support biden while
they're waiting to see what bloomberg
does
so bloomberg might be just trying to
take biden out of the race
because that would be i suppose a good
play
now bloomberg doesn't want warren or
bernie sanders to win
but apparently uh bernie sanders and
warren
are trying really hard not to win this
race so i think that part's gonna take
care of itself
did you see uh bernie's latest plan
on the border so bernie looks at the
news
and uh he sees that there you know this
slaughter of this mormon family
americans living in mexico by the
cartels
and and before the before the family is
even buried
he announces that he wants to open the
border with mexico and basically get rid
of ice
don't deport anybody and give free
health care to anybody who comes across
so you would decriminalize the crossing
and not deport anybody
and if you get in you get a reward free
health care and a job
so i was wondering
what that meeting looked like was there
a meeting in which bernie said you know
that heart attack really got to me i
really don't want to be president
anymore can anybody think of a policy
that would guarantee i couldn't possibly
win the win the election because i've
been telling people i'm gonna
you know tax the hell out of them and
i'm still one of the top
polling people what can i say
to make people not vote for me is there
anything i can do
to guarantee that i can you know fall in
the polls and get out of here
and somebody be like idea over here yes
you um you could say open the border
the same week that americans were
slaughtered by the cartel
and bernie's like that's good well
that's good
i'm going to try that so i think barney
bernie bernie is just self-immolating
he has no chance of being president with
a policy like that no chance
you you imagine running against trump
with a policy of letting the cartel in
and giving them free health care i'm not
even joking
bernie's policy gives free health care
to the mexican cartel
all they have to do is drive onto our
side of the border
free healthcare
it's just mind-boggling the the
i i can't even figure out if it's
incompetence
because it just looks like somebody
intentionally trying to not win
it would be the very thing you would do
if you wanted to lose
and of course warren's plan is scaring
everybody with money and that's no good
way to win
so we'll see what happens buddha judge
still looking like
the sleeper dark horse candidate
you notice that nobody really talks
about him except to say
that he seems to be moving up in the
polls so
buddha judge continues to not make news
but the reason he's not making news is
he's not being bad crazy
so what is it that the democrats want in
the candidate
right now they kind of like someone
who's not bad crazy
and buddha judge keeps delivering that
i'll just say reasonable things about
health care
i'll say reasonable things about the
border i'll say reasonable things
i'm just not trump you know i'm sort of
democrat policies
and i'm reasonable he can't get any news
coverage
with that kind of a play but eventually
people will catch on
oh yeah it needs somebody reasonable
in the comments somebody's saying
african-americans don't support booty
judge
that it's hard to know exactly if that's
true
because biden is still in the race i
think the way to know
who the african-american democratic
voters would prefer
would be after biden leaves which we all
expect
so once buttons out where do those votes
go to elizabeth warren
probably not bernie
not so much buddha judge
i know he might get a share and i think
that whoever gets elected is going to
get a
you know a healthy healthy dose of the
african-american vote just for being a
democrat
all right um let's talk about
uh harris
so you might hear me making this same
joke uh
on on the
greg often show but
i can't uh i can't help pointing out
that when you're looking at the
democrats and there's
there's sort of this oppressive level of
incompetence that we're seeing in the
whole field
that it's just sort of head shaking
stuff and my favorite example is that
there are some democrats who want to
lower the voting age to 16.
that's an actual thing people are
talking about
at the same time harris announced that
she wants
school day to be extended to a few more
hours
so that it matches up when the parents
get home
now if you're a 16 year old
and you just got the right to vote are
you going to vote for the ones who want
to put you in school for a few more
hours
or are you going to vote for trump i
want you to go out and hang out with
your friends
so somehow the the democrats
have found the only way
they found a self-canceling policy it's
like i've got an idea
we'll let the 16 year olds vote because
they
they're so heavily leaning toward
democrats clever
at the same time we're going to jail
them in school for three extra hours
and we'll we'll see who they vote for so
i think they're creating a
general a generation of trump supporters
and they don't know it
um so that was hilarious
somebody has a bloomberg
campaign logo that i'm trying to decide
if i think bloomberg had anything to do
with it or is it just somebody
supporting him
but man is it bad and
and likewise if you saw harris's video
there was a campaign video
it was so bad it looked like it was made
for somebody who was running to be in a
cubicle in the 80s she's listening to
her laptop and she's got headphones on
that recorded
you know at least at least give us some
wireless headphones
will you if you're doing a president if
you're running for president in 2019
and you're shown listening to a laptop
go wireless go wireless um
so she looked like she was running to be
uh
i don't know an executive assistant in a
in a cubicle environment in the 80s or
something it was it was the most
unpresidential thing you've ever seen
uh and it's amazing that she allowed
people to even see that but
uh my point is that you don't realize
how
bad other people are at messaging
until you see trump's campaign do it
you know when you see brad parscale's
operation you see the
the quality of the video they produce
you see that they hit
every note you know anything that comes
out of the trump campaign
is perfectly produced the logo
is always great the the visuals
the composition the color the sound
the message the order of things the
length of it
all of it from top to bottom
the trump production
best we've ever seen would you say maybe
best we've ever seen and then you see
any of the other candidates it looks
like they made it in powerpoint or
something in their spare time
it's it's insanely
you know there's quite a difference
there anyway
saudi arabia reportedly
bribed a twitter employee to spy on
users
so that's cyber security experts are
saying that now
is that true it's something that a cyber
security experts are saying
we don't really know that's true i mean
um
it's it's in the category of things
that you should not necessarily
automatically
assume is true or even that you know the
context
first of all i don't know what it means
to spy on users
i assume that means looking at their
direct messages
because everything else is public by
design right
i know so maybe some maybe maybe
but this raises the interesting question
uh how hard would it be to influence
any of the social media platforms if you
could find an employee who had the
passwords i'm
simplifying it's it's harder than just
having a password
if you could find the right employee or
employees and bribe them
and how much would you be willing to
bribe somebody
to influence an entire platform
well millions yeah
five million dollars you there's
probably somebody
who would pay enormous amounts of money
if they could find the right employee or
employees
who could somehow manipulate the
algorithm without getting caught
now i don't know enough about the
platforms and the algorithms and the
security that they put in them
to know if that's even possible but i
also don't know it's impossible
so i would love to dig into that i've
invited
jack dorsey to come on the periscope
sometime
and he said yes but as you've learned
from my other invitations there's a big
difference between somebody saying yes
and then actually getting it scheduled
so i don't know if i'll do it but i'd
love to ask him that
and jack if you're watching this i'll
ask you now so that you can think about
it
is there any way that we in the public
could understand the process and system
that goes into creating the algorithm
and for example
how many people understand the algorithm
let's just just take twitter for an
example
how many people know the ins and outs
and the code and
who's got control of it and if you
change this variable
you get this how many people understand
the whole thing
if anyone wars is so enormous and
complicated
that everybody has their little module
and they become experts in the module
but that's all they know they don't know
how what they do
is influences the rest of it except by
guessing i suppose or
common sense so i'd love to know that
because it would tell you in sort of
general terms
how susceptible they are to a bribe and
you know do they have processes in place
to make sure that the only people who
have the access to be able to change the
algorithm
have multiple people watching them you
know the controls
one password isn't enough you know that
sort of thing and then i asked myself
who are the potential people who would
want to bribe
an employee at a corporation and the
list is so long is crazy
first of all it's you know every
billionaire who has a
dog in the dog in the race every
campaign
every intelligence operation
of other countries plus our own the cia
our own cia they'd have a lot of reason
to
to try to get control of the social
media platforms
so i think we need a lot more visibility
into that
even if the visibility is sort of on the
concept level
all right the funniest thing lately
about
trump is there's a there's a new book
out and i
i don't know the title of it doesn't
matter so there's a new insider book
uh reportedly by some anonymous person
about you know the inner workings of the
white house and
and trump and it tries to make the case
that he's impulsive and he won't
his decisions are impulsive and um
and then he won't read the briefings and
stuff now these are things we've heard
before
but what's different about it is this
what's different about it is that trump
has been president for three years
so if you're looking at trump's
operating style
and it's so consistently reported that i
will say it's probably true
that when people say he's impulsive
they're sort of reading his mind you
don't know what's going on in there
but let's just say yeah he brings up
topics
that you weren't expecting now to other
people that might look impulsive
but but what they don't know is how long
has he been thinking about it has he
talked to anybody else about it
if it's just the first time you hear him
come up with an idea hey let's do x
and you you've never been part of the
conversation
what would you think of it would you
think well we've never talked about this
you just threw this into conversation
it's impulsive but how do you know
this could be something he's thought
about for 20 years could be something
he's had
meetings with he's talked to you know
his casual
advisors could be something he's been
thinking about for a long time
you don't know what's in his head you
just know it's the first time you heard
it
so to call that impulsive is
mind reading which is one of the things
i talk about and lose or think
uh and we get we get
so accustomed to stuff like this
that we start to believe that this mind
reading is somehow a legitimate part of
the news
or a legitimate part of what we know
about people it's not
nobody knows what's in his head all we
all you know is it's the first time you
heard the idea you don't know if it's
impulsive
but then the other the other charge is
that he doesn't read the briefing
materials the background stuff
now is that a problem
well you imagine a situation in which it
would be you know it's easy to imagine
that's a problem
but it's been three years
what problem has it caused name a
problem
can you tell me one problem that caused
i've never heard one
so three years into it is it still valid
to talk about his management style
think about it before he was president
was it
valid to talk about his management style
of course
of course in fact it would it would be
one of the most important things you
could talk about
you'd want to talk about his character
his personality his management style
you know his impulsiveness whether he
looks into the details
terribly important you and you want to
look at those things and say okay
a person with those qualities is likely
to do a good or a bad job in your
opinion
but now we're three years in those
questions are irrelevant now
because you can tell that the
combination of his personality and his
characteristics
is either working or it's not
and obviously it's working unambiguously
it's working so you have to ask yourself
how the heck does that work how can you
get good results
being all impulsive and not looking into
the details
well maybe that is the maybe that is the
system
so here's something that i've always
said about trump
i guess in my mind i don't know if i've
ever said this out loud
so fact check me on this have i ever
said this
on a periscope one of the
uh best qualities of trump
in terms of strength of technique
so this is just a technique
statement one of his strongest strengths
is simplification
and in order and that's how he
simplifies his messages
so build them all you know uh
push china you know stuff like that so
he just he's
he's a really good simplifier that's
what makes you good at branding and
marketing
it's what makes you a good persuader so
he's a simplifier
but there's a there's a skill
that goes into simplifying and it's the
the bigger skill
and i've never seen trump get
credit for this and when you hear it for
the first time you're going to say
oh that's actually important
here it is if somebody is a good
simplifier
they can tell what's important
that's the skill the skill isn't
simplification
the skill is knowing what's important so
that when you get rid of all the other
stuff
what's left is what's important
and you see that in everything trump
does
so when he was running people said
hey you can't you can't spend
this little money and run for president
apparently he knew that spending a lot
of money wasn't important
in his case because he got a lot of free
press
hillary clinton did not campaign enough
in the in the battleground states
she didn't think that was important at
least in the context of her campaign
trump campaigned in the right places to
win the electoral college
because he knew what was important
so trump consistently
looks into complexity and pulls out the
stuff that's important
that is such a superpower and it's also
invisible
to people who aren't looking for it you
know all you see is sort of
what he says and what he's doing you
don't you don't have any sense
that just before that was all the the
smart stuff the smart stuff is
what's worth talking about and what do i
throw away
do you think his decisions would have
been substantially better
if he read background reports
probably not you know what would have
been different about the way we're
negotiating with china
nothing what would be different about
the way we're
uh dealing with north korea what would
be different about the way he handled
taxes what would be different about
anything
he apparently knows how to get to the
central truth of things
without all the garbage so
um let me put it in starker terms
the people who are complaining about the
president not reading their little
background reports
are people who don't know how to tell
what's important
that's why they have those jobs because
they can't tell what's important
not at the same level that you know a
top leader can
they think everything's important so
they put it in a report they put it on
the leader's desk
and the leader who's good at it who can
tell the difference between what's
important and what's not
the just picks it up and says okay yeah
china
i got it i got it covered get back to me
so we have never seen any specific
problem that's caused because trump did
not read
some document one assumes that every
time the trump trump says
in a meeting with his advisors if he
says hey i've got an idea let's try x
at that point when the president tosses
out an idea
the smart people who have read the
background material because
they should they're the advisors say
oops
there's something you don't know that
idea won't work
there's something in the background
report that says why
it's because of x and then the president
presumably i'm not in a room but i'm
just
this would be the normal way that
anybody would manage and the president
would hear that and say
are you sure about that the advisor says
yes
president makes a judgment about the
person is that a person who tells me the
right things is the person with good
judgment is the person who knows what
he's talking about
yes did they just give me a good reason
that makes my idea
not practical yes let's move on
he doesn't need to read the background
materials indeed
his ability to avoid the details
is probably one of his best qualities
because he seems to be able to run
things with any of that
take an example of selecting supreme
court justices
the way other presidents did it i guess
as they looked at each justice and they
listened to people's arguments or
whatever
and then they picked one what trump did
is he found an organization that is
respected for
selecting potential supreme court people
and then he told the public
i'm going to pick something from that
list definitely
you know eventually that was his message
he said it's definitely going to be from
this list
who's on the list mr president i don't
know
[Laughter]
no that's not quite true because he
actually knew some of the personalities
on the list
from you know he's known him for a long
time heard about them etc
so he did know something about a number
of the people on the list
but he didn't need to know much
he just needed to know that everyone
agreed everyone being
conservatives they agreed that the
organization that made the list
does a real good job of picking judges
that are
conservative and qualified for the court
that's all he needed to know
hey there's a respectable company or
organization
they make a list i'll pick from the list
so
you can't get you can't get much simpler
than that and how has it worked out
really really well for conservatives
so my point is that
it looks it just looks
um well say
it looks inexperienced for somebody to
look at a book
about trump's management style and
characteristics
his impulsiveness and stuff and judge
that it's
not working because it's clearly working
and it might it might even be the model
remember they said the same thing about
reagan and i think reagan had the same
quality
which is reagan might not have been the
smartest guy in the world
but he could sure tell what was
important he had a knack
for for getting to the the hardest stuff
all right um
i believe that's what i wanted to talk
about
anybody have any questions did you
notice what i didn't talk about today
i didn't talk about ukraine because it's
descending into
ridiculous boring
you know just stuff we don't care about
oh matt tybee had a
good article i read it what was it
uh i let let me say this this would be
the weirdest
recommendation i read matt tybee's piece
in rolling stone there's a new one and i
remember thinking it was sensational
what was the topic
uh something about the ukraine
basically it was a it was very
anti-democrats
i think it was about ukraine totally
worth reading
it was about the dossier something about
that
but uh i i think matt tybee who
correct me if i'm wrong i don't think he
associates
or ever has with the right right isn't
he sort of a
left you know a reliably left-leaning
guy
but he's going uh he's going full
independent on
what's going on with ukraine and
russiagate and stuff like that
in other words he's a smart guy who's
actually looking at the actual facts
and and
it's it's jarring because he's so good
he's one of the best writers you'll ever
see just you know just
a sentence that he writes is really
delightful
you know you'll enjoy reading his actual
just the words they're just great
um so anyway you should google that and
read it
um somebody says tybee has
perspective yeah it's a good way
thank you all for uh getting my
book somebody asked is tyrus back he is
yes
thoughts on daryl davis i don't know who
he is
somebody says do you do you and
christina see eye to eye on most things
yes uh astonishingly we're
we're on the same page about most things
in life
go on joe rogan again it doesn't look
like it i've got a uh
l.a trip coming up and um
i haven't heard from him i would have
i would of course go on his show anytime
you wanted but but
i don't think that i'm necessarily the
kind of guest that he needs to bring
back
more than once so
um
what happens after trump i don't know
that's a long time
from now 20 or 30 years from now
thank you all for uh uh
you and trump are number one best
sellers on amazon today
i think i'm number one in my in a couple
of categories
not number one overall but um
you know let me let me tell you some of
you like hearing
sort of insider things about the author
process
i i hear that all the time i'm going to
assume that some of you do and i will
tell you
an interesting thing so when you're
writing a book
and in my case uh because i have other
things to do
it takes me maybe a year to write a book
and
get it all edited and designed the cover
and everything so it's about a year
and that means that i i write
when i start writing i just start
writing to get volume and then i do a
lot of editing and massaging and stuff
so there are things that i wrote a year
ago
that were in one form and you know that
i keep writing and then i find oh i've
written the same chapter twice
and then i have to get rid of one so
there's a whole bunch of editing and
rearranging and the
and re-reading when you're writing a
book and then you're re
rewriting it and reading again you're
not reading it like a reader
you're reading it like the person who
wrote it so you can't really tell
what you're creating while you're
creating it
because you can't put yourself in the in
the independent observer's mind you
can't be a customer
and see your own writing as the customer
the reader would see it
because you're you're into it too much
but
the first time that even i
as the author can read my own
book as a reader is when some time has
gone by
and it's in its final form because
there's a big difference
between my raw first draft and then
they're rearranged and edited
and you know i've got the order of
things and they're in good categories
and the chapters make sense
and one chapter leads to the next and
all that and the first time that
i got to do that was actually last night
this is strange to say but i'll just say
it anyway
i got so many good comments about the
book this week
i mean like insanely good comments um
that i wanted to see what they were
talking about like i actually got
curious about my own book
because again until last night
for all practical purposes i had never
read it
i wrote it but i've never
experienced it as a consumer so i
thought well i'm going to see what's in
there
because i really didn't know and so i
read it for the first time
not all of it but a few chapters last
night
and i thought to myself oh pretty good
so uh the part of the uh
the cycle of being an author is when you
first write a few
chapters you might read them and say
yeah these are good you come back a week
later and you read the same ones you're
like ah these aren't good
so you go through this it's good ah it's
bad it's good
that's bad that's good and what you can
hope
the only thing you'd hope is that the
last thing that you read
it's good and
so i was quite delighted with this one i
must say
yes i am tooting my horn during book
promotion
week i hope it's not too obnoxious
i do it for uh for good purpose
i think i think this is the sort of book
that people can
get a lot out of
start with bragging and end with
bragging somebody said
that's right i'm bookending it have i
hypnotized christina
well not in the formal sense oh let's
talk about kanye if kanye runs
well he's not going to run in 2020 but
he did say he's going to run in 2024.
um
but somebody just said i got an audible
version of the book and i need a hard
copy now
i've heard from dozens and dozens of
people this week
that they bought two versions of my book
for themselves
people would buy a you know a kindle and
a hard copy so that they've got a
one that travels and one for home and
they'd buy the audible for the car but
then they'd want to buy the hard copy
for a reference
i've never seen i don't know if this has
ever happened before and i just didn't
know
but i've never seen so many people buy
two separate versions of a book at the
same time
is that common do people do that
do you do that for other books because
people are wildly doing that for this
book
somebody says they bought three versions
of win bigly
you have somebody else i bought three
formats
i bought hard copy and kindle and audio
i've never seen that before
somebody says i've done it
i love being read to while reading
oh somebody says i love being read to
while reading that's interesting
and other people are saying they
routinely do that somebody says i
usually buy both
somebody has audible kindle and the
collector's version has world in it the
typo
somebody says what what made me put sa
on the inside cover and what you're
referring to
is is this i just took the cover off and
there's little
embossed essay here i don't know what
that is
i saw it too now it happens to be my
initials
but i don't know that i don't know if
that's why is there
i mean i have no idea
it doesn't stand for a loser think all
right
oh yeah there's a mega challenge uh
what was that there's
some african american rapper
is running a a challenge for people to
make
raps about the president and the
president said he would invite the uh
the finalists to the white house
so the president is very good at knowing
what's a good show
and so it was brilliant of him to say if
somebody's creating wraps
for the president obviously the
president would like to
you know bolster his african-american
voting base
it's just brilliant because it's just
fun
it's just plain fun compare compare
trump inviting uh
probably african-american rappers
to the white house how is that now fun
right because they'd be doing probably
humorous
and clever raps about about the
president
that's just nothing but fun now compared
to
uh you can have a beer with elizabeth
warren or something
whatever the other candidates are
offering they don't have a sense of the
show
they don't they just don't have a sense
of what people want to consume
they're not rappers is that true
is am i using a outdated uh
are they hip-hop artists am i using the
wrong term i think somebody's
giving me a hard time
all right let's talk about kanye kanye
um seems to be serious about running in
2024
and as you all know he is a force of
nature
and you certainly would not want to rule
him out for
anything you know if kanye said he was
going to
try to compete in the olympics i'd say
what he doesn't seem like an
inexperienced athlete as far as i know
maybe he is
but because it's kanye i'd say well
maybe maybe
i don't think he can bench press 500
pounds but
you know if he trains maybe so
uh i say that jokingly but i think
kanye has maybe something more important
to offer
and by more important i mean maybe
something more like a
spiritual leader a spiritual leader who
is
accessible there are lots of spiritual
leaders but they're not all accessible
meaning
they're not for everybody you know maybe
they're too cultish maybe it's not your
religion
you know maybe it's just not your
ethnicity maybe
there's something about it that you say
well that's somebody else that's not me
but kanye has this um he's sort of
developing a
i'll say a brand of spiritual religious
experience that seems to be completely
accessible stop laughing bill
[Laughter]
this is more accessible so
meaning that uh who likes who likes
kanye basically everybody
who likes um jesus in the united states
well almost everybody who's a christian
and and anybody who's not a christian
doesn't disagree with jesus right you
don't have to be a believer
to say at the same time well the jesus
stuff is good stuff
you know whether you think it's you know
historically exactly accurate or not
all the jesus stuff is good stuff so so
kanye's managed to find a way to appeal
to
you know the left while making them a
little bit uncomfortable about how
friendly he is with the right
well the right is a little bit
uncomfortable but
you know because maybe they weren't fans
before or whatever
but everybody's kind of seeing him do
the jesus stuff
and then suddenly both sides are like oh
that's good
we like that part and then he goes and
he creates
i i honestly didn't know if he could do
this so he created this
um what would you call it christie music
christian i don't know what it is i
don't know the right terms but his new
uh
album is all about jesus
and religion and i thought to myself
is he to find an audience for this is
this going to be good
and sure enough it is you know it's it's
not exactly my kind of
entertainment but apparently
it's hugely successful well done
his usual amazing creativity
um so he did it again
you know every time you say every time
you think to yourself well
maybe you should stick to music not
fashion oh okay fashion worked he made a
billion dollars with that
but you know don't do religious music
stick to your
regular music and stick to your fashion
stuff oh okay i guess he can do gospel
music too
so it seems to be doing anything he
wants
but my point is that his i believe his
strength
is not in the details so
it feels like he would be wasted if he
got ground up in the regular
political process no maybe not
you know once again i might be making an
assumption that's unwarranted
but i hate to waste what he brings
by putting him through the grinder
because i i don't know what you're like
when you come out the other end of that
but if he keeps doing what he's doing
in every way not just the music the
inspirational stuff
but if he just keeps talking in public
about things that
matter to him i don't know he's he could
be one of the most
well maybe he already is one of the most
powerful
figures in the country on for all the
positive
stuff and then he doesn't have to deal
with the you know the potholes and the
and the details and stuff so
i say he's more powerful as not a
president
and that the president experience would
take away his power
you know it would add a different kind
of power he'd be in charge of the
military and stuff
but i just think he'd be more powerful
than even a president
in his own way if he just continues
doing what he's doing
so running for running for president or
putting your name out there is a good
strategy
even if you don't run for president so
i'm sure he is smart enough he's
definitely smart enough
to know that just putting his name into
that conversation
improves his his power and his
power is being used for good he's
clearly
he's clearly decided to spend the rest
of his
you know productive life making the
world better
you know instead of just making money
so uh i'm a big fan anyway that's all
for now i'm gonna go pack and
head on home and i will talk to you all
later
