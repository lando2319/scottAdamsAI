hello everybody
hello to youtube i've already been
talking to the
locals subscribers for a few minutes and
i'll bet you're wondering i know what
you're wondering you're thinking
will today be the best coffee with scott
adams of all time
yeah yeah it will i say it every time
and it's true
every single time and all you need is a
copper marker glass attacker chalices
die in a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip famous all over the
world and it's going to happen
now go
oh i'm seeing somebody say the cnn did
report
that on the charlottesville situation
trump said both sides were good
now saying that there were fine people
on both sides
is a little bit different than saying he
was praising the neo-nazis so they may
have stepped away from it a little bit
because one would be unambiguous fake
news
but the other is true-ish he did
actually say the words that there were
good people on both sides
as long as they don't explain what he
meant by both sides
well they can be weaselishly true
but also fake news at the same time
which is
as you know their sweet spot
well um
here's an interesting factoid you know
every time we think we know something
about statistical truth especially
during the pandemic
what happens when reality gives us a
fact check
every time we think we understand what
the statistics are telling us
reality is not serving it up here's an
example
and i don't know if what's wrong is it
the way we measure stuff or are we just
dumb
but anatoly lubarski had a
good tweet he noted that the uk
cases of crotavirus are rising and
they're rising faster
this summer than they did even last
summer
now that's in a condition in which um
fully 50 percent of the uk is fully
vaccinated
now does this make sense to you could it
be true
that the va that the spread is worse
this year this summer than it was last
summer
during the height of the pandemic and
kevin you're going to go away put users
in timeout
all right so all the trolls with their
bad audio stuff
they're going to go away so do you think
it makes sense that you could have
higher infection rates
this year when half of the country is
vaccinated
that happen how is it possible
that you've reduced the number of people
who could get it by something like 50
percent
and it's rise and the rates are rising
faster
well first of all yes i think it is
possible
so the first thing is yeah but our
common sense it doesn't
uh your common sense has trouble
processing that right
so this is just one of those cases where
the data and what your brain thinks
is likely just don't match but i don't
know
i don't know that there's really any
problem here it could be the way it's
measured it could be that it's moving
fast
with young people but it doesn't matter
because they're not dying
so these things are too complicated to
know if your common sense is really
telling you anything useful
here is a fun fun thing so you know cpac
is happening right
so cpac all the republicans getting
together going to do their speeches
president trump is going to do the
closing speech i guess and
don jr has already promised us it will
be provocative
people will be upset about it now we
don't even know what it's going to be
about yet
well we kind of do don't we i mean you
could pretty much guess what
kind of themes he's going to hit but
he's going to be shaking things up and
finally we'll get some fun news
i'm so tired of the boring news we need
we need trump to give us some fun news
but here's the the most fun part of the
cpac
there's a group not associated with cpac
but they're attending i guess
patriots soar soar and they're handing
out a seven point plan
i guess they've got some little handout
seven point plan for reinstating trump
to the presidency not getting him
reelected
but reinstating him into the presidency
and here's how the plan goes uh
i think this assumes that in 2022 the
republicans have a
good midterm election
once the republicans take control of
congress
apparently it's legal to pick a speaker
of the house
who is not even an elected official
so apparently the republicans could pick
trump as the speaker of the house
without
him being in office i need a fact check
on that but i think that's true
right now if that's true
then trump assuming you had a republican
majority only
could start organizing
impeachments and he could impeach
biden and then he could impeach harris
and the only thing he would need would
be a republican majority
because it wouldn't matter what the case
was right
impeachment is a political process
if you have good evidence for it well
maybe there's more chance
somebody will get impeached but you
don't really need any
you actually don't need evidence
tell me if i'm wrong give me a fact
check on that
if the republicans just had a enough of
a majority
and they simply wanted to impeach
somebody they could just do it right i
mean they would have to make up some
you know bs reason but that would be
easy in a political process you just say
oh it's obvious that biden has dementia
right how hard would it be
for republicans to say look the biden
administration
is not dealing with the fact that their
leader has dementia
the vice president should be stepping in
and she's not
harris so you have to impeach them both
what's wrong with that argument no
seriously
what's wrong with that argument right
now i don't know
so impeachment isn't just for
incompetence right
i mean you need a little bit more than
that but
i feel like you could just stretch any
argument as far as you want as long as
you have the majority you just have to
get the votes
and nobody's really responsible for what
they vote for
so all you have to do is convince the
republicans that
uh and i'll just use that argument again
that it's obvious
biden has dementia you could make that
case with a straight face
right you wouldn't be lying would you
i mean you would be going farther than
your medical expertise
should take you because you don't have
any but
it would also be considered reasonable
by people who heard it even if they
didn't like it
even the democrats would say oh i hate
it that you're trying to use impeachment
but it's not the worst point
that there's something wrong with them
and if harris is not stepping in to do
something about it
she's not doing her job and if she's not
doing her job she needs to be removed
so that could be the argument now will
any of this happen
very very unlikely really really
unlikely
but it's kind of fun it's fun to know
that it might
um here's a question for you and it's
just a hypothetical
we know that there are coven variants
and the variation could for example be
more or less deadly
but it could also be more or less
transmissible
so it could be different in a variety of
different ways
thus the variant part and i wonder this
could you hypothetically i'm not
suggesting this is a good idea
but it's more of a science nerd question
could you hypothetically it would be
terribly immoral and unethical so don't
do it
but would it be possible to develop a
variant
of the coronavirus that spread as fast
as the delta variant or faster
and gave you very little symptoms but it
did give you immunity
against other variants
what do you think could you in effect
vaccinate the world
by creating a weak variety of the
virus and just let it go now obviously
this would be the most
unethical thing in the world right it
would be deeply immoral
so we're not going to argue that right
we're all on the same side
you don't you don't give people forced
vaccinations by tricking them with
a virus in the air but
it'd be possible wouldn't it and if it
were possible
would it be something that you would
ever use in a even
worse pandemic you know this pandemic
was pretty bad
but it could be much worse one assumes
so i'm seeing a lot of yeses interesting
yeah it would be obviously the worst
idea in the world to try to do it
but it might work weirdly oh and there's
a dan brown novel with that
topic that makes sense sounds like a
movie plot yeah
all right um there was a study on mass
effectiveness in kansas in which
different counties were looked at to see
if
where and masks worked what do you think
was the result
remember kansas is pretty republican
and they had some counties with no mask
mandates and some
some with some without what do you think
did masks
work well according to this study they
worked really well
do you believe it do you believe that
anybody
can actually effectively measure
whether or not masks worked so
i have a really really big question
about whether anybody can even measure
this thing because i feel like too many
things happen at the same time
by the time by the time you mandate
masks
don't you also do lockdowns and more
distancing and
treat it more seriously so i don't think
there's ever a case where the only
difference
between two locations is masks or no
masks
so the first part is it might be hard to
tease out what really is the mask
part secondly you can't do a randomized
controlled test
because since the assumption is mass
work at least by the
scientific community if not by you
there wouldn't be any way to say well
this group don't wear masks during the
pandemic and this group wear them and
we'll see who
does better so you can't do the kind of
study you want to do
it would be unethical so you're you're
left with
a less reliable ways to check it
and do you believe that when these
researchers at the institute of policy
and social research
they said that it saved about 500 lives
in each adoptive county do you believe
that
do you believe that masks saved 500
lives
in each county that did them
i think i'd have to see a lot more
studies i'd have to see a lot more
people look at it
we don't really live in a world in which
you could take any of this seriously
yeah i'm saying that people are not
believing it
uh i'm still on the side that says if
you could measure it
you'd find that masks made a difference
uh but i don't know if you'll ever be
able to measure it i just don't know if
i would ever
trust any study on that all right um
let me uh let me give you an
update on something from yesterday you
might remember
that yesterday i told you a funny story
about
uh how christina and my wife and i took
personality tests
and online personality tests so there's
no science behind it it was sort of a
variant of the myers-briggs test where
you get an you're an intj
or an entf or whatever you are and
i was joking because my result came out
that i was compared to people like uh
martin luther king mother teresa and
nelson mandela
and i joked that my wife did the same
test and came out
similar to vladimir putin now
i may have cherry-picked some data
so let me do a clarification in addition
to
having a a test that was similar to
vladimir putin
well number one do you think vladimir
putin took the test
of course not do you think mlk or
mother teresa took the test of course
not
so when the test says that you have the
same personality as these famous people
there's no science to that it doesn't
mean anything but
other people who would have the
allegedly the same personality type
as uh christina would be isaac newton
much better than vladimir putin uh elon
musk
uh stephen hawkings beethoven john nash
the
mathematician at jfk now if you wanted
to know how unscientific
this personality test is do you think
that jfk
and vladimir putin should be in the same
category
and right there doesn't that isn't that
kind of a tip off
so i wouldn't um i wouldn't put any
stock in this
so by the way the the myers-brigg
personality test
uh purports to figure out what kind of
personality people have
and then the the reason is
the reason that you figure that out is
so you can deal with them more
effectively
right so can you
can you actually do that if you knew
what your personality type was
and you knew what somebody else's
personality type was
could you use that to great advantage in
your
business or personal life and the answer
is
probably not there's no reason to
believe that makes any difference
and i'm not sure that there's any
science stephen figuring out
what your personality is because when i
took the test i was aware of answering
the questions
the the way i wanted to answer them or
or let me say it another way
when i answered the questions on the
personality test
i was kind of saying who i wanted to be
maybe more than who i am you know what i
mean
like maybe i gave myself a little bit
more of a
a little bit more of a positive review
of my own personality than perhaps was
warranted
you know when would that be unusual so
i've got a feeling that people's own
assessment of their personality
is pretty wonky to begin with and that
once you've assessed it it doesn't mean
you can work with somebody else if
if you know their personality so in the
dilbert comic i have mocked the
myers-brigg
test a number of times and i will
continue to do so there's no science to
it
all right and i was just having fun with
the personality test
okay um next
topic what would it take to convince you
that the earth is warming because of
human activity
what would it take to convince you so
let's say
um i know my audience well and i know
that
it is a common belief among many of my
audience members here
that climate change is not happening or
that if it is happening it's a
some natural very variation and has not
much to do with humans
so i know a number of you are in that
camp i i'm not in that camp
i'm in the camp that almost certainly
humans are making some difference
but we're not good at predicting it and
we're also very good
at remediating so i'm not as worried
about
long-term devastating consequences
because other people are
as long as other humans are really
worried about it and working on and
putting tons of money into it
we'll be fine but you know it's probably
productive to worry about it is my view
now i could be wrong about that so if
you ask me scott what is your level of
certainty
i would say not 100 but pretty high
pretty high so but here's the question
to you if you're in the camp that says
now the world is not warming uh because
of human activity
maybe maybe because of natural variants
or solar flares or whatever
you think it is what would it take to
convince you otherwise
is there anything because if you don't
believe in climate change
being human caused to some extent you
don't believe science or at least you
don't believe scientists i should say
it's not that you don't believe science
that you don't believe the consensus of
scientists
so what would it ever take to change
your mind
now i'm not saying i'm going to try to
change your mind
i'm seeing roger saying the tony heller
video should be required
viewing let me tell you if you think
that
you're really in bad shape right
every time i bring this up somebody
brings up tony heller
tony heller may have uh may have
destroyed the earth
i'm not saying for sure but the tony
heller effect he's a
well-known critic of climate change but
he's so
well known and did such good work
communicating
that he's the main reason that people
don't believe in climate change on the
right
one person because if you look in the
comments you'll see he's the most off
well really the only person who's ever
mentioned now
here's the problem if you watch
you know 10 or 20 tony heller videos
you will be convinced that he's right
how many of you have had that experience
how many of you watched
enough tony heller videos
to say my god this is convincing he's
right
in in the comments how many of you have
done that because i've i've gone down
that
rabbit hole and if you watch enough of
his videos they're really really
persuasive
like really persuasive
how many of you just looking into your
comments
um never heard of the guy
who all right so
here's what you need to know if you
watch only tony heller videos
they're really convincing so don't do
that
because if you watch only one person's
view of anything
they're going to be convincing so the
problem is not that
tony heller is right or wrong the
problem is you took a method of finding
information that can
never work you hear this clearly
if you followed down the tony heller you
know
path you took a way of finding
information
that can never work and it has nothing
to do with tony heller
it has to do with watching any one
person's content
is the worst way you can understand
anything because they will be persuasive
because you're not hearing any counter
argument you have to read the debunks
and then read his stuff and then read
the the counter to it
and then read his response to the
counter to it etc
you've got to go pretty deep down the
hole before you realize that everything
that tony heller says
has a reasonable defense
maybe not everything because sometimes
the critics will find things that are
being done
wrong but it doesn't debunk the whole
you know thing it might be there's a
messy spot or something
yes al gore is the same problem if you
just listened to al gore
and he was your primary source of
information you would be using a process
which guarantees you would be
not well informed so the same thing i
said about tony heller
who says climate change is not real is
exactly the same
as i would say about al gore and by the
way
al gore would tell you the same thing
if you had a private conversation with
al gore i
i feel confident this is true by the way
i have had
private conversations with al gore
that's another story
but in the white house when he was vice
president i got to hang out with him a
little bit
um i like al gore by the way i think
he's the real deal
now whether he's right or wrong any
particular things is a different
question
but i think he's actually i like him
anyway so i'll just put that out there
but i think he would agree with this
statement because he's a he's a rational
guy
if you said the only information you
have is from al gore
should you treat it as credible
not even al gore would tell you that i
don't think because he seems like a
pretty strange shooter he may be right
or wrong
on stuff but i think he's a straight
shooter and i think he would tell you
that listening to any one person on any
big complicated topic is a terrible idea
so it's one thing to listen to al gore
but you got to listen to
tony heller maybe also and then you got
to listen to the debunk of the tony
heller
potholer is one famous one and then you
gotta listen to the response to paw
holder
which could be pretty persuasive but you
gotta go all the way down or else you
don't know anything
so what would it take to convince you
that climate change is
real think about your own answer you
don't have to answer me
but think about if there's nothing that
would convince you
why do you believe it right you have to
check your thinking if there's nothing
that could change your mind
no no new information no better source
no record temperatures anything
what would change your mind i'm not
saying i'm going to try to change your
mind i'm just wondering what would
all right apparently more than 30
million americans were under
excessive heat warnings across the west
does that change your mind so we have
these
your record highs all over the place 30
million people with
pretty serious heat warnings yesterday i
kept getting
information from my local energy company
pg e
telling me that they were maybe going to
turn my power off
for one or two hours
smart people in the comments so the
question i asked is
would you be persuaded by 30 million
people being under
excessive heat warnings and almost all
of you said no
correct that is correct having a
an excessive high temperatures does not
prove climate change
we all agree with that right that just
because you set a record
that's that's not enough suppose we set
suppose we set a record every year for
10 years in a row
would that change your mind
how about 20 years suppose we had a new
high
i don't think this is likely but suppose
we had a new
high every year for 20 years in a row
at the end of 20 years would you say
yeah that was probably something going
on there
let's see would that convince you 20
years
every year is a new high
a lot of people saying no and no is the
correct answer
yeah no is the correct answer because 20
years is not very long
in terms of you know the history of the
earth
you could have a 20-year period where
you know things are
things are different now if that were
the only evidence
i would say maybe that's not as credible
or convincing as it should be
but it won't be the only evidence there
will be you know evidence from a variety
of sources etc
so we'll keep an eye on that
why are we having rolling blackouts in
california
so yesterday was the first day they said
your your electricity might go off
voluntarily meaning that the power
company might turn it off just to save
electricity
well as michael schellenberger tweets
there was a california electricity grid
manager who explained it in 2020
quote people wonder how we made it
through the heat wave of 2006.
the answer is we had san onofre a
nuclear plant
and a number of other plants totaling
thousands of megawatts
that are not there today so the reason
we don't have enough electricity
is not climate change it's because we
ignored climate change
because getting rid of nuclear power
plants
is like being really dumb if you if you
have a climate emergency that you
believe is your
your top priority and
as you're listening yesterday to a
podcast in which
i heard some very smart people uh
say for example they should put nuclear
power plants and
desalinization plants up and down the
coast of
northern california or all of california
and
just solve that problem it would be very
expensive
but how would you like to have no water
so there are your two choices it's
expensive
or you don't have water
easy decision if you had a good good
government
that would be an easy decision well does
anybody know if
branson is up in space yet or up in near
space i think he's going to be near
space
does anybody know if he left there was a
delay in the virgin galactic flight
and richard branson was going to be on
it himself
sir richard branson and i believe we got
delayed 90 minutes
so hasn't taken off yet i'm hearing in
the comments all right
um how how does it make you feel
that branson is in the flight and
likewise that
bezos will be in his first flight
how does that make you feel
because i understand what branson is
doing he's not only bringing attention
to it by being on it
but he's also trying to convince people
that you know it'll be a safe way to fly
in the future
but here's the thing elon musk has told
us directly people are going to die
in the quest to get to mars which i
think is one of the smartest thing
anybody ever said in public by the way
when elon musk says you know people are
going to die and
he's working on a project that's going
to kill people
but we kind of have to get to mars you
know the the the future of humanity does
require us to settle space there's no
doubt about that
and i love the fact that he's
transparent about it yeah people are
going to die
i don't know if elon musk will be on any
of his upcoming flights
but it would be not unreasonable for him
not to
because i'd much rather have elon musk
alive
than dead now i don't know if i feel
exactly the same about richard branson
or even jeff bezos who's now sort of
retired from
amazon now i don't want any of them to
die
just to be clear you know i very much
want them all to live
and i think they have all they'll have
great value to the planet
but elon musk probably the only one
whose direct
contribution makes a difference to
whether we'll get to mars
all right probably it does matter who's
in charge there
so i would hate
oh my god i would hate to see anything
happen to branson or
bezos that would be just so bad
for space exploration but on the other
hand
you have to give them a compliment for
leading with
putting skin in the game you know
is it a coincidence that these two
leaders are unusually successful
maybe this is why right maybe this is
exactly why they're so
successful that they'll get on their
damn plane
or rocket or whatever it is they'll take
it themselves
and they'll risk dying three minutes and
counting
oh it left off somebody's
so where are we are we actually in
countdown
give me an update on that as we go all
right here's my suggestion for
those of you who don't like critical
race theory
in schools here's how i would handle it
you know oh he launched already or did
he
all right so you know that if you argue
against something you don't like
the people on the other side just dig in
deeper right
so telling people that something is a
bad idea
that they think is a good idea does it
ever work
no in the real world it just never works
usually they've already thought of your
argument anyway
but once people dig into a side they're
kind of hard to move
but there is a way to do it doesn't work
every time
but it goes like this and you've heard
it before if you
buy into a bad idea and then extend it
you can just break it in other words by
pretend
that you think it's a good idea buy into
it
and then take it to its logical death
here's how you do that with critical
race theory instead of saying
no i don't like this critical race
theory
i think it's racist but in a different
way nobody can hear that argument
instead do this say yes we should do
critical race theory in schools
and there are two improvements i would
like to add
two improvements how does anybody argue
against
improvements not only do you like
critical race theory but i like it too
and here's how i would improve it
because you and i both like it
wouldn't we like it to be even better
really i mean
it's so good now let's have a little
more of that
right so here's how i'd make it better
number one
i would make a national maybe a federal
requirement
at least the state requirement that
parents
have to be given the materials
parents have to be presented with the
same materials
for the critical race theory that the
children are being taught
a legal requirement why just to make
them better informed
parents because the parents are part of
the process right
what would happen if parents were well
informed
and had a real clean summary of what
critical race theory is teaching
would they still be supportive i don't
know
but i love critical race theory and so
for me
the more you can spread it the better so
if you
teach it to the kids well you want it to
stick right
so also make the materials available to
their parents
because their parents can then reinforce
it when the kids get home
right the more critical race they're in
the better
so give it to the kids but make it a
requirement that the parents have to see
the details
see where i'm going you can embrace
something until it dies
here's the second part of that
so you you require the kids to see it
um and the you let the transparency kill
the bad parts
but um
i'm having a brief memory problem here
uh the second part which i just wrote
about on locals can somebody remind me
what i just wrote
because i just blocked this on the
locals platform all right they'll tell
me in a moment yeah i'm having a biden
moment
the the problem is that i make notes for
myself so i don't do what i'm doing now
and the the the place where this note
belongs is right in this little space
where apparently i was just about to put
my note
about what i was going to talk about
right now and then i got distracted
all right yes there we go thank you so
the
the point i was going to say is that you
should include in the critical race
theory training
that teachers unions are the biggest
source of systemic racism
does anybody disagree teachers unions
are what prevent
school competition school competition is
the only thing that will ever get
good schools for everybody or as good as
we can get
so it is the teachers unions who need to
be included as a lesson
within critical race theory to improve
it
how can you have critical race theory
training and leave
out the biggest source of systemic
racism you can't do that
so there should be a module that is
included in it about teachers unions
being the biggest problem of all
so those are the two things make the
parents see all the materials and
include
teachers unions being the biggest source
of that problem
in those cases bring it on
let let's see us some critical race
theory now you may say to yourself but
scott
aren't you accidentally accepting all
the other things that i don't like in
critical race theory
and the answer is this is how persuasion
works
the fact that you're uncomfortable with
me saying that i would like any part of
critical race theory
is what makes you hard makes it hard for
you to look away
that's the intentional wrongness i could
have easily
fixed it by saying oh i'd like to take
all of the parts
i don't like out of critical race theory
that makes sense right
wouldn't you like to take all of the
parts away that you don't like
but by not doing that i made my
i made my uh proposition uh
a little there's something wrong with it
right it would be wrong to accept
anything that's wrong
if you know it's wrong but i've told you
directly that i would accept it
with a couple of tweaks now that's
really just to get more attention on the
tweaks i'm talking about
it's not really because i'd like the
rest of it although i don't know because
i've never seen it
so if i did maybe i'd feel differently
um speaking of uh
vaccinations which we weren't how many
lives do you think were saved in let's
say just the united states
based on vaccinations in the comments
what would be your guess
how many estimated lives we'll just say
between now and the end of the year
so hopefully that would be capture most
of it
how many lives do you think were saved
by vaccinations in the united states
just the united states
just the united states the answer is oh
i'm seeing pretty good guesses there
your guesses are actually pretty good
now that doesn't mean it's right but
there is a source that estimated
that without a vaccination program by
the end of this year
there would have been approximately 279
000 additional deaths
and you know 1.25 hospitalizations
1.25 million and that would just be the
united states alone
so does president trump
and president biden after him for
following up
get credit for saving 279 000 people
do they get credit for that and do you
believe it
i'm seeing some doubt there seems to be
some doubt about whether you could
measure this well as someone who has
done many
estimates of numbers of things in my
professional life
i don't think you can measure this i i
feel like any estimate of this is going
to be a little bit suspicious
if you know what i mean but when you
come up with an estimate that just
coincidentally happens to be right in
the range of things you'd think it would
be
then you should be really suspicious
what happens when the estimate that you
know you put a lot of time and effort
into it
you're figuring out all the variables
and you're you're trying to isolate
variables and all that
and and after all that work you come out
to a number that's
just about the same as what you might
have guessed
that's a little bit of a flag you know
what i mean
a little bit too close to exactly what
you thought it would come out as right
around 300 000.
if i had said hey there's going to be a
study on vaccination effectiveness how
many people do you think is saved
i'll bet most of you would have guessed
somewhere between 100 000 and 500
000 right and there it is right in the
middle of that range
so while i do believe that vaccinations
have saved a lot of lives
i don't believe you can estimate it with
any kind of
confidence all right
so kamala harris continues to be a
nightmare for the democrats
in the most entertaining way she might
be the least
competent politician we've ever seen in
the white house
i don't know is anybody less competent
than she is
it's really shocking and now the latest
controversy is that she's
talking about a possible compromise with
ids for voters and of course
forcing somebody to have an id reduces
the number of people who can vote
but we don't know by how much and now
she's saying that rural people can't
even get a photocopy of their id
so it'd be harder for them to register
to vote and
rural people said what
we might be rural but we know how to
make a photocopy
and i ask you this question why do you
need a photocopy
you can't take a a smartphone picture
of an id and just send it to an address
if there's a physical photo
photocopy requirement
if you have a physical photocopy
requirement you couldn't also have just
an email address that you just
send a digital image and then if grandma
doesn't have a photocopier and grandma
doesn't have a smartphone
grandma says hey can you just take a
picture of my id and send it to this
email address
and your grandkid just takes a picture
of it it feels like this is solvable
with technology
we should not be arguing over what
kamala harris calls xeroxes
it's 20 21 for god's sakes
if you're using the word xeroxing that's
a that's a red flag right there
as she did but then she corrected it to
photocopies realizing what she'd done
but if we're even talking about
photocopies what the hell is going on oh
did the launch
launch just happened keep me informed
i want to know that he made it safely at
least past the
the launch very exciting
and congratulations um he's in the air
god imagine what it feels like how would
you like to be
richard branson right now he's actually
going into
i think near space not quite space
on a rocket that he caused to be built
wow i would be scared to death
but quite exciting
all right yeah i don't think i'll be
signing up for any space
stuff immediately um
and apparently so so kamala harris is
overwhelmed with all these
vague jobs that uh
let's see what is she in charge of she's
in charge of
looking into the origins of the southern
border migrant surge
expanding voter rights closing the
digital divide
space council and some other stuff and
here's the worst answer ever done she
was asked
asked about whether she had too much on
her plate and she said
quote yeah maybe i don't say no enough
do you want to hear somebody who might
be president of the united states
do you ever want them to hear do you
ever want to hear them say
maybe i don't say no enough that is the
weakest
statement any politician ever said
you do you want a president who can't
say no
that just makes you completely
unqualified to be a leader
like you can't say no even to your boss
i mean
even though it's the president you
should be able to say no
if you can't do that you're not very
useful as a leader
but she's very motivated by all the hard
work another terrible answer
so it makes you sound like a wonk you
know
don't be motivated by all the hard work
how about
um how about be motivated by all the
benefits you could
bring to the country something like that
so there's some suspect they found with
a bunch of guns in a hotel
in denver and they're afraid it was
going to be a mass suicide attempt
but here's the weird part there were
four people involved
when have you ever heard of a uh sort of
a mass killing
that was really sort of a suicide
attempt you know somebody just tried to
go out
big when there were four people involved
in the plot
that seems to eliminate it doesn't it
all right um
i'm just looking at your comments for a
moment all right seat back is happening
people are gonna be outraged
got more of that coming and
that is just about all the news that's
worth talking about
now apparently the democrats are
panicked because when they do a poll of
people
and ask them what are biden's
accomplishments what do you think they
say
so in the comments tell me what do you
think people say
when the public is asked what are
biden's accomplishments so far
the answer is they don't know of any
because even people who would say oh he
did a good job rolling out the vaccines
they kind of know it would have been the
same under any president right
don't we know that or at least we don't
know how it would be any different
because it was going to happen it wasn't
like he had the idea
hey i've got an idea why don't we
implement
the vaccines that we made so i'm not
sure what biden actually added to that
process other than taking credit
yeah so what did he do eat ice cream and
make the border situation worse and make
russia china and iran hate us a little
bit more
what it would be really hard to come up
with any accomplishment
it's starting to look as if the
republicans have
a real strong midterm coming which would
not be surprising
historically yeah he's got crime spiking
off the charts
he's good at stairs somebody says
he brought decency back to the white
house
did he so we know he lied
right we know he's done anti-science
stuff
all of the reasons that he ran for
office he's
he's proven didn't work
right all right well that's all i got
for today and i will talk
