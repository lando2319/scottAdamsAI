hey everybody
come on in oh do we have stuff to talk
about
boy do we and if he didn't see my
tweet and he didn't read the description
of this periscope let me warn you again
hide the children there will be swearing
hide them put the earmuffs on
but before we start what do we need to
do yes you know it's the simultaneous
step and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea sign a canteen joker flask a
vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
including cursing it's called the
simultaneous hip and it happens now go
so the other day i was testing my
digital assistant from amazon whose name
shall not be spoken so i don't
activate all of your devices at home and
i said to my device
a-l-e-x-a i said play
coffee with scott adams and sure enough
it just starts playing my uh you know at
least the audio of
my podcast but here's the interesting
part
whatever it was playing i guess the last
time i had been using
you know the the player i'd played it at
maybe double speed or
1.5 speed i'm not sure so i got to hear
myself
at 1.5 or or twice the speed
and i gotta say it's better
it's way better as a
presenting technique i should tell you
that
i intentionally speed up the pace at
which i speak
when i'm doing it in public but when
you're the audience and you hear it back
it still doesn't sound fast enough even
to my own ear
so there's this weird uh speaker problem
you have where
where time is different for the speaker
than it is for the listener
so right now i'm intentionally talking
at about maybe
50 faster than i would talk if you were
here in person
and it's still not fast enough so i
recommend that you listen to me
um either on locals you can play it
faster
i think youtube will do it i think the
podcast uh
can do it as well so speed me up
it's way better um so
looks like putin has poisoned another
critic
i don't know what to think about that
it's bad but i don't know if it changes
anything because it's not i mean
except for the person who got poisoned
because it's not like putin was going to
be
removed from power or anything so
i don't know why anybody would live in
that country
or even live you know be a russian
national
and and be opposed to putin
and you would need a food taster for
that that's some dangerous stuff
um i don't know how much longer i will
be broadcasting the
coffee with scott adams from this
location
because i'm checking every hour to see
if i have to evacuate
so there's a very large fire that's
heading my way
i'm talking about a really large fire
that last i checked was five percent
contained
and there's nothing between that
enormous fire
uh and my house except for very burnable
stuff
so if our uh in fact my town is
looks like a staging area for the fire
departments
i noticed that there's there's one area
down here the fairgrounds that are just
full of
fire department people
so i don't know if i'd want to stay and
fight it out
because i i built this house to be
fireproof
it's a you know i actually picked it so
it would be drought proof i have my own
well
should be fireproof because it's
designed to have nothing on the outside
that can burn
something would have to get sucked in
which could happen
but externally there's nothing that
could catch fire
i might have to remove one
one tree that's a little too close but
otherwise i could probably ride it out
even if the rest of the neighborhood
burned up
it was built it was built for that
specifically that the entire
neighborhood could catch on fire
as long as i wasn't killed by smoke
exposure the house probably won't burn
but i don't know if i'm going to take
that chance and i certainly wouldn't
keep the animals here so
i may be evacuating soon
and let me say this about the governance
of california
you have up badly
the the government in my state can't
keep the lights on
and can't keep fires from destroying the
state now
we did have a lot of bad luck this year
in the sense that
i think there were 11 000 lightning
strikes in the last 24 hours or
something
so there are a lot of fires and we don't
really have lightning strikes
that's not really a thing that happens
this time of year
typically so it feels like
between the coronavirus and this it's
just one thing after another
but anyway we'll i'll uh i'll stay here
as long as i can
uh steve bailey got arrested we'll talk
about biden in a minute
if you're waiting for the swearing
that's where it's gonna happen
um steve bannon got arrested for
allegedly
scamming some money out of a fund that
he had
he was attracting money to build the
wall privately build a wall
and here's the thing i feel as if
there's going to be a lot more to that
story
because steve bannon is already quite
rich
according to a quick google search has a
20 million dollar
net worth i don't know if that's
accurate but that's
that's what you can find on the internet
and i'm wondering would a guy with a 20
million net worth
be involved in a small scam that had
these qualities
there are witnesses because there's
somebody else involved in this camp
so there's at least one witness
let's see if i have to evacuate yet
not yet um
so i'm a little i'm a little skeptical
that the original charge is gonna stick
he pled
not guilty it would be easy for me to
imagine
that he either wasn't aware of it some
lawyer did it or his partner did it
uh or that there was something else
going on there just might be more to
that story
but then we also find that there's
something about his connection to a
a rich chinese businessman
whose yacht he was on when he got
arrested and that part of the story
might get a little more interesting
so we don't know what that's all about
but here's my general statement about it
i wouldn't assume that he's guilty of
the the the scam somebody's guilty
obviously his partner at least from what
we know
looks more guilty because he's the one
receiving the money
if this is if this is what it looks like
if the allegations were true it means
that
it means that bannon would have done
something he would have committed a
crime
primarily from the benefit of another
person
which doesn't feel like the kind of
crime that people commit
honestly so if i had to guess he's going
to have a good
defense but this chinese connection
might be a little bit
more interesting so we'll see what comes
out of that
i saw a story it's a it's not a current
one but
there was a group that figured out how
to build twenty thousand dollar homes
so if you've got the land they can build
a
kind of a cute looking home uh for
twenty thousand dollars
now if you've got a 15-year loan a
mortgage on that
four percent let's say uh that'd be like
less than 150 a month for a mortgage
imagine if you will this model because
this is what i'm playing with in my head
i don't think this particular um
technique they use for the twenty
thousand dollar
home is as good as you can do i think
you could do way better than that
and still keep it under twenty thousand
in other words make it more livable
more more green etc and if you could
you can imagine a situation in which
there's lots of land in the country
that's close to free because nobody
wants to live there
you know there there are blighted areas
and cities
where the land is almost free or free
because nobody wants to live there there
there are places that you could
imagine that are low-cost anyway
you can imagine a model where somebody
could build their own their own
twenty thousand dollar home and then
build another one right next to it
and rent the second one out because you
could probably rent one out
for i don't know five hundred dollars a
month whereas
it only costs you 150 a month for the
mortgage
to pay for it so you can imagine that
people would
build one for themselves build a couple
more on some land that they have
adjacent
and suddenly they have not only a skill
which is building these things
they have a home and they built a few
more for other people who
don't want to build their own house but
want to live in one
so i think there's going to be some
model in the future where people learn
a low-cost lifestyle that's sustainable
and that they can they can have a full
good life
without the things that usually would be
more expensive
i think that's where it has to go it's
not like just that i want it to go there
it kind of has to go there because it's
the only solution that's left
the way things have shaped up uh
and maybe we need some kind of an
executive order so you can get loans for
this sort of thing
because right now you couldn't you could
never get a loan for it by the way
how messed up is this you can't get a
loan
for a 20 000 house do you know why
even if you were you had good credit
you know everything was good you know
you had a job you you qualified
you still couldn't get a loan for a
twenty thousand dollar house
and the reason is that the banks own
internal costs
to service any loan doesn't matter how
big it is
the administrative cost of it is about
2300
or something like that it doesn't matter
if you made a million dollar loan or a
20
000 loan so what does the bank want to
do
doesn't want to make any 20 000 loans
they're not profitable
because their overhead would be more
than they can make from the loan
so there are some structural things that
would need to be cleared away before you
could do this
simple simple thing all right maybe we
need some kind of executive orders for
that
let's talk about joe biden um
i don't i hardly know where to start
um it was such a bad
evening dressed up as a good evening
now i was of course immediately drawn to
watch
cnn as soon as biden was done speaking
because i wanted to see how they would
treat it you knew
they were going to say it was the best
speech he'd ever given that was kind of
a
that was kind of baked into it um and
then of course there would be
conservatives who said oh my god it's
terrible
you know he was just reading off a
teleprompter but the
uh the fact that he based his campaign
on being a the guy of good character
the one who cares at the same time and
in the same speech
perpetrated the most divisive race hoax
in american history
the fine people hoax now you'll see the
left
fighting back this morning media matters
and others
are are trying to double down on the lie
because there are so many people in the
public
such as me for example
uh you know joel steve cortez
yeah i saw charles payne i saw ali
alexander i saw
you know jack bassamic you know just
probably
hundreds of of people who have some
clout
at least on social media saying no
that's like a totally debunked hoax
he's basing his campaign on a debunked
hoax
now one of the people who believe the
hoax say
ho ho ho you right-wing crazy people
you you're trying to tell us that we
didn't see it with our own eyes
we didn't hear it with our own ears oh
no
i saw it and i heard it and i can prove
it here's the video
of what i saw and what i heard here it
is
and then they'll show the edited video
which is the hoax
if they show the whole video it shows
trump
without prompting and this is the
important part there was no prompting
said i'm not talking about the neo-nazis
and the white nationalists they should
be condemned
totally if you leave that part out
it could be misunderstood that he was
praising the
people with the torches and so
in order not to be misconstrued later
without prompting trump clarified to
make sure you wouldn't interpret it
wrong
and they locked that part off and made
it
the central part of biden's campaign so
they turned the truth into a lie
by getting rid of the clarification
and beyond that there's a second lie
that
that's baked in and the second lie is
this
that it matters who was there
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
if there were any fine people there it
doesn't matter
if there was anybody there who disavowed
the racist and just
liked the statues it doesn't matter
because trump gave his assumption
that he thought there were fine people
there who fit that category of
not racist and that he spoke to his
assumption
worst case scenario is that he was
mistaken about who attended
right that's the worst it could be is he
thought there were some fine people
but once you looked into it maybe there
weren't
except that i looked into it personally
because i'd said some things in public
which caused people to
uh to contact me and people
several of them and you're gonna ask
well why don't you give me their names
of course i'm not gonna give you their
names are you kidding me
one of them actually said that i could
and i said let me talk you out of that
you don't want your name attached to any
of this but i do want to hear your story
and one of the one of the attendees was
jewish
the other you know jewish background now
do you think
that the jewish guy was marching with
the tiki torch
people saying you know jews must not
replace us
i mean seriously he was against the
racist
he just was there for rallying for the
statues
now you could argue that you shouldn't
support statues because
you know that alone is is racist i don't
support statues i think they're
offensive and should be taken down the
the the confederate ones and
uh but you'd have to explain
how it is as something like a quarter or
a third
of black citizens are in favor of
keeping the statues
if you can't possibly be a good person
and want to keep the statues just for
history even knowing that they're
offensive to some people
how do you explain that that quite a
number of black people
want to keep the statues are they not
fine people
the only way this hoax can exist is if
you never
talk to anybody who attended watch watch
the people debunking the
the debunking what they think
is the debunk the people who are trying
to say that the find
the find people hoax was real that it
really happened
will only describe it from the
perspective of the media reports
at the time and they will say well there
you go
there's no there's no media report of
the time of
any fine people but i talk to them
in person like i personally talk to them
on you know the telephone but i
personally talk to them and they tell me
the story about
showing up in one case they didn't know
who organized it at all
they had no idea who organized it but
they knew there was something going on
about statues
they were local and they said well we're
local we want to keep statues
there's something about that going on
we'll show up and give our
you know give our opinion that's it were
they marching with the races
no they never got close to the marchers
because the police
stopped anybody coming in after a point
and said don't go over there
and so they didn't they were sort of
trapped in a
you know in a police confined area and
then when it was over
they all went home that's it now if the
president was wrong about who attended
that should be the story he was
incorrect about who attended
do you do you know who else was
incorrect about who attended
 everybody every person
who thinks this hoax is real is
incorrect about who attended
every one of them i know because
i talked to him
the president worst case scenario
is in their category of not knowing who
attended worst case
that's it so
joe biden tries to sell himself as the
kind
and caring guy the man with character
and that he bases his whole
 campaign on the on the fine
people hoax
do i care that he's a lying piece of
not really i don't care if if biden is
an
i mean he's a politician's gonna be bad
people
i don't really care that he's a lying
piece of
but i do care that he painted a
target on my back
this is personal this isn't about
politics anymore this isn't about the
tax rate
this isn't about any thing
except this
 one of the worst people
in the whole
god damn world just painted
another target on my back
now it would be one thing if he had said
it once
i'd say well you know he tried it down
it didn't work
but making it the center piece of his
whole campaign
that is going to make me vote
for the first time first time recently
as you know i famously don't vote
because i don't want to be biased i
don't want to be on a team
but i think this is not about
politics anymore this is self-defense
i'm going to vote for self-defense
because this guy can't be in
charge
not with the race oaks now people can
say what about trump
what about the things he says that are
not true well yeah
he might say some things that don't pass
the fact checkers
maybe but are they ever like this
this isn't like anything he's ever
 done
he told you he wanted to keep crime out
of the country and then that turned into
he's a racist
trying to protect your country is the
 job of the president
it's the opposite of what
 joe biden
is doing he's not trying to protect the
country he's trying to tear it apart
the fine people hoax is not like
other lies
it's the tentpole hoax
that makes people who are stupid and
believe the fake news
think that it's all true because if they
see this one's true they say
well it must be true that the other
thing they're saying about him is true
it's the only one that they think they
saw with their own eyes and heard with
their own
ears because it got edited so they don't
hear the clarification
and because they're sure that one's true
it makes
all the other things that don't have
actual evidence or any credibility to
them whatsoever
seem clearly true but worse it makes it
seem like anybody who supports trump
must clearly know that he was supporting
these fine people
and therefore it makes us look like
 joe biden
if you're making your fellow citizens
targets
for violence and discrimination
and you're doing it
intentionally
you are not worthy of being a
citizen
in this country much less a leader you
have not qualified
at the basic level of understanding the
god damn
constitution which should treat us
equally
and should not have you targeting your
fellow citizens for violence and for
discrimination
you goddamn piece of and
it's worse
it's worse than that here's why it's
worse i just wrote a blog on
locals that i share you can see this
even if you're not a subscriber i
shared it on twitter so you can see it
joe biden has introduced a new form of
 slavery
that's right he just introduced a new
form of slavery
because this this fine people hoax has
the intention of first of all winning
the election duh
but also to bind black people black
voters
to the democratic party if he does that
and it looks like he's succeeding
he has once again taken away all black
political power
if you live in this country and you're
allegedly a citizen
shouldn't you get some political power
how about that
how why do white people have political
power why do they
how come black people can have political
power because you don't have any
political power if you just vote
democrat
because joe biden told you the
biggest lie in american history
and you bought it you
believed it
because you watched cnn and you think
it's news it's not news
it stopped being news several years ago
it's pure propaganda
and you know who else is fox
news
fox news you are just as guilty
as cnn no no better no better
i will make exceptions for some of the
hosts
on fox news greg guffeld being a notable
exception
has called out this hoax but it's pretty
 clear that whoever is producing
fox news
is not too interested in killing this
hoax it's pretty clear
so whoever is running fox news you
you fix this
you it's you know you've got the
responsibility because you're the main
the main vehicle or voice for the people
who support trump where you used to be
what the
 happened what the happened i
turned on the news last night
and i'm watching fox news talking about
what a great speech it is
without talking about the center of the
goddamn speech
being the biggest race hoax and lie how
the do you leave that out
how is that not the most important
 thing to say
about the whole event that he
was tearing the country apart
intentionally with a with a hoax
how is that okay media matters is trying
to debunk the debunk
and acting as if there go those crazy
right-wing people
acting like it didn't happen when we all
saw it on video
yeah you saw the hoax video you
everybody saw the hoax because that's
the one you show
show the rest of it if you read
if you read the media matters a piece
that tries to debunk
the debunk the debunk it actually
includes the statement where trump says
specifically he's not talking about the
the racist they actually include that
and act like you didn't see it it's the
most amazing thing i've ever
seen in my life
so joe biden you
 piece of don't try to sell
us on character
when that's the worst thing anybody's
ever done as a politician
in this country you can't find
anything
that trump did anything the
nixon did that's worse than this
nothing
all right i might have a few more things
to say about this
john avlon the douchebag on cnn who just
says
everything that republicans do is
terrible
he said this this morning empathy and
decency may be the word most used in
this
convention really empathy and decency
because those are the qualities that
define biden
let's take that as true let's say that
according to the people who support
biden
the qualities that define him are
empathy and decency
good that would be a reason not to make
him the president
let me explain to you what a good leader
is
a good leader is somebody who can do
some hard stuff
a good leader is tough you want a leader
who has empathy
but not as their guiding
principle
because if empathy is your guiding
principle you're gonna get
walked on
china is gonna eat your goddamn lunch
like they will
if biden is president iran is gonna
 take over the middle east
because you're a who's
leading
with your empathy and decency do you
know what i want less of
less of that for my commander-in-chief
less of that
yeah i want somebody who obviously cares
you want somebody who wants what's good
for the country but the presidency is
unique
you need a warrior there and somebody
who's a warrior against your enemies
not somebody who's a warrior against
your own citizens
which is what biden has literally
promoted himself as being
i will be the guy who demonizes half of
the country
elect me no i want him to demonize
 china
who's sending boatloads of their goddamn
fentanyl over here
to kill our citizens while your
 son
is taking a billion dollars from them
disqualified
dis qualified you shouldn't be a
dog catcher in this
goddamn country much less the
president
i want a president who has transparency
and has married his own personal fate
to the fate of the country you get that
there is no scenario in which a
president can do a shitty job
and somehow it works out well for the
guy who did the shitty job
that's not a thing there's too much
transparency too many people watching
even
in the room all the secret stuff it
would all come out there is no scenario
in which trump could even imagine in his
head
that there's something that would be
good for him that's simultaneously bad
for the country
you want that guy you want a warrior
who cares cares about the country trump
obviously does
and i would say that anybody who becomes
president cares about the
country
that is the lowest standard you could
throw a dart
into a crowd and find somebody
who cared about the country
that's not hard you couldn't set the bar
lower for joe biden do you know
what they don't say when they're
complimenting him
oh they do say oh he's got some empathy
and some decency
but they don't say he's got capability
they don't say he's got a good track
record because he doesn't
they don't say his brain is working
because it isn't they don't say he could
survive the first term
because he can't
then of course he had his uh his uh
incredible
ideas for coronavirus which is to reword
trump's actual current policy into angry
dementia talk
and act like it's not happening
and he can depend on his lap dogs and
the fake news
to report it just the same way like
trump isn't doing any of these things
oh do you know what trump never thought
of how about rapid testing
trump never thought of rapid testing did
anybody
not think of rapid testing
that's
biden's big improvement how about if
we'll do
i've got an idea how about doing rapid
testing
yeah nobody thought of that
before if we could do that
right away we'd be doing rapid
testing
now it should be noted that there's a
different kind of test a
the the paper strip kind of test that
you don't have to mail anywhere
and you don't need a machine it just
changes color
that kind of test the trump
administration
has not told us why they won't use it
and they won't tell us they will
that's a failure if you if you'd like to
see me being
objective i would say that they have
failed
completely
um so the yeah
so let me let me keep my scorn all the
places it belongs
whatever the is happening with the
fda and by the way
trump needs to to explain this
all right trump not talking about this
topic of the paper
test strips even to rule it out which
would be fine
if there's a reason to rule it out i'd
like to hear it but not
talking about it is
disqualifying too
if you don't hear trump talk about this
in the next few weeks him too i'm
voting for kanye
seriously i'm going to vote for kanye if
if i don't hear anything about these
 test strips
because that's not even close to
competent all right i think most of the
other stuff with the coronavirus
i'd say is as good as you could do under
the situation but whatever that happens
with these test strips
which by the way is not what biden was
talking about he doesn't know the
 difference
between the types of tests he just said
oh how about fast testing
like we haven't thought of that
no trump's got some explaining to do
this is a fail without even at least
talking about it
the test strips specifically the paper
test strips that don't require
a machine and don't have to be sent
anywhere to get a result
so apparently there was a big mistake by
the
anti-biden people in painting him as so
incompetent
that he couldn't appear in public and
cnn
managed to turn this into oh
you know people and even fox news did
this
even fox chris wallace was saying
anybody who thought
biden would be you know unable to
you know put his words together they
were disappointed
because you could see biden was
perfectly capable that night
perfectly capable at what he gave the
shortest
acceptance speech in modern history did
you know that
it was the shortest one coincidence
is it a coincidence that the guy who
might not have too much stamina also had
the shortest acceptance speech
could be a coincidence probably not
and did anybody on the right believe
that that biden was incapable of reading
off a teleprompter
what was essentially his stub speech
that he's probably got memorized
nobody really thought he was so gone
yet that he couldn't read and stand
all he did last night is stand upright
for less time than any modern president
before him
or even candidate and read
he read in public and what did
this people on cnn do
they had tears in their eyes oh it was
the best speech
joe biden has ever done he's unified the
country
we have finally found real leadership
all he did was stand for a little bit
and read a teleprompter
and now he's the best politician who
ever lived i think we set the bar a
little too low
let me remind cnn and all the
idiots over there
as well as a fox that
the bar is can he do things that are new
that's the question nobody's really
questioning whether he can read
i don't know if anybody has said he's so
gone i don't know if he can read
nobody said that
and you know it's a the cnn way to
conflate things that don't belong
together
can you debate is a little bit
different
from can you read those are not
similar tasks
all right um
maybe that's all i needed to say
so once again i will be spending some
part of my day
debunking this stupid fine
people hoax
once again once again
yeah fox news is not off the hook on
this they got a lot of explaining for
this
frankly and i'm going gonna go register
to vote
i don't know how you do that i guess you
do it online i mean i haven't done it in
so long but i don't remember how it's
even done so i'm gonna register to vote
um if trump says something about this
test strip idea then i'll vote for him
if we don't hear anything about the test
strips and you know
other countries are using it and you
know it just gets ignored
