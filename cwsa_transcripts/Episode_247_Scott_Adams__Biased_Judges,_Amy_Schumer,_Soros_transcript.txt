[Music]
all the people who have names i can't
pronounce maria i can pronounce that
tyler
tyler you're always in here early you
have fast fingers
kelly hi mike
donna come on in here because you know
what time it is
it's time for the simultaneous sip the
people who got here first
get the best sips of all if you'd like
to join me
lift up your cup your mug your chalice
your glass your container of liquids
and join me for the simultaneous coffee
preferred
oh that's good stuff
so i got in a little uh twitter exchange
this morning
with an anti-trumper who said and i'm
paraphrasing
this is this is somebody said this in
public
so here's the funny part about it you
think you're living in
the same world with everybody else and
you think
well everybody must see what i see right
you're seeing what i see right
i'm watching this you're watching that
we're all seeing the same thing right
and if i've taught you nothing it's that
that isn't true
and i thought it was a little more
obvious by now
and again this twitter exchange with an
anti-trumper who said
i'm summarizing everyone can see what
trump is like now
so if you support him well you're you're
responsible because
according to her everybody can see what
trump is like now
and i responded that is the lowest level
of awareness you're ever likely to see
the lowest level of awareness is to
imagine
it's all it's mind-boggling there's
somebody
there's somebody who can walk and talk
and read and write
someone who's smart enough to tweet
so they can use a device of some sort
an adult and yet they have not
noticed have not noticed that people
have a different
perception of who trump is so for her to
start
from the presumption that we're all
seeing the same thing
is the lowest level of awareness that
you're ever going to see
now there was a point in the evolution
of the civilization and the human mind
and that point wasn't long ago it was
just maybe 2015.
i would say if you said in 2015 hey
everybody's looking at the same thing
so if you're still supporting this
president or this anything
well you're going to have to own it
because we see what we're getting
that was so 2015.
i warned you back then that trump was
going to rip a hole
in the fabric of reality and you were
just going to see reality in a whole new
way
for most people i think they've made the
leap
they've made the leap from the what i'd
call the second dimension to the third
dimension
the second dimension is you think that
everybody sees what you see
and this poor tweeter was stuck in the
second dimension i forgot anybody's
still there
and the third dimension is that it's
obvi
it's absolutely obviously true
that we're watching two movies on one
screen
we're looking at the same stuff some
people say kavanaugh
definitely guilty some people look at
the same stuff
definitely innocent how could it not be
obvious
now i i completely understand
if in 2015 somebody was still saying i
think we're all looking at the same
stuff
so if you've come to a different
conclusion you're evil
you're either evil or stupid because we
have the same information
we now know that that's two-dimensional
thinking
and that we're all living in in a world
of our own creation
that that exists almost entirely in our
own experience in our own mind
and it does not mean that if somebody
supports president trump
they must be evil on the inside it just
doesn't mean that
it just means we're seeing something
different than you're seeing
here's a curious one we're having this
big national discussion about uh judge
kavanaugh's
temperament now of course as i've told
you
temperament is a sexist term it's an
anti-male term
because you don't really see it applied
that much to women
in a similar way you don't see the word
hysterical
applied to men hysterical is sort of a
sexist word applied to women
temperament seems to be the sexist word
that's applied to men
but what we're watching is a lot of
people saying well
we've all watched the same thing we've
watched
judge kavanaugh's let's say emotional
response in in his comments
in front of congress and some people are
saying
that especially his references to
clinton
and the democrats trying to get him
that that makes him and on that makes
him a biased
judge that he can never be unbiased
because he's talked about clinton he's
talked about clearly one side out to get
him and i said to myself
did you say the same thing about judge
curiel
do you remember the judge curiel case
the judge curiel case
presumed that because he had mexican
heritage
he was not he was not mexican citizen he
was second generation
but because his whole family had
heritage
from mexico you would imagine that he
had a lot of family influence
and that his family in all likelihood we
don't know
but in all likelihood members of his
family were anti-trump
because the media had set up that that
fight
and they turned the you know trump
strong on immigration
into some kind of an anti-mexican thing
so that's what half of the country was
seeing so it was completely reasonable
in that context
in the legal context to say well there's
a situation here
that has a unique potential
can't guarantee it but a potential
impact on the bias of this judge
is that fair to say is it fair to say
that if this judge is likely surrounded
by family members who don't like
president trump that that could have at
least the appearance of bias
in his decisions and people pushed back
on that and they said
no you can't call a judge with mexican
heritage you can't you can't call him
potentially biased
because that's racist well it was crazy
then
because people and still crazy because
people
are biased machines that's what we are
we are pattern recognition machines
and when we see patterns we're
influenced by them and in the legal
context it's perfectly appropriate to
say
i think these patterns are having a
larger than normal influence on a judge
maybe this judge should recuse in this
specific case
likewise with judge kavanaugh
just so we can be consistent either
judges are are never biased
by their situation or judges are biased
by their situation
it can't it can't be true that both are
true
you know in general we're not talking
about these specific judges now
but it can't be simultaneously true
that judge curiel could not be biased
by his family which is weird i mean
if there's anything that's going to bias
you it's going to be your family
right your family is going to bias you
pretty much
what is it that's bothering judge
kavanaugh well to a large extent
it's the effect on his family too and
he's feeling that
this is coming from one direction sort
of the democrats sort of the
clinton-friendly part of the world
and so he called it out now i would only
ask people to apply the same standard
if you're willing to say that this judge
has shown a political opinion or a
political
yeah a political opinion if you think
that him displaying this
political opinion makes him unqualified
to be a judge just be consistent
that's all i'm asking i'm not asking you
to change your opinion
i'm asking you to be consistent because
if it's true that kavanaugh
could be could be biased by his
situation in a way that would make him
ineffective as a judge
stick with your opinion but also extend
it to judge curiel
who having nothing to do with his
particular
um his that his ethnicity wasn't really
even the issue
it was that his family is very likely to
be influenced by this
and it would be hard to imagine that his
family doesn't influence him
right so i'm of the camp
that biased judges are the only kind
there's no such thing as an unbiased
judge
because they're human there's no such
thing as an unbiased
human there are however judges who can
learn to
read and interpret the law in a way that
they can do in public
and other people can say okay you're
probably biased on the inside
but i'm looking at your opinion i'm
looking at your reasoning i'm looking at
your conclusion
and i would say that was fair you know
compared to the law
right so you've got two drug two judges
here who are accused of bias
in a way that should make them
ineffective i say
pick one pick a side either judges are
biased
by their situation their environment
especially things involving their family
of course they are of course they are
but are they too biased well it's hard
to know
um you saw maybe uh judge kavanaugh's
uh he wrote an op-ed for the
wall street journal i think and
he in it he said uh i'm not going to
quote him because i don't want to take
time to look it up but essentially he
he said that his primary audience
for his um testimony and statements in
front of congress that his primary
audience was not necessarily the public
at large
not just the people in the room but that
his primary audience
was his family where have you heard that
before
who was the first person who told you
that if you're evaluating whether
brett kavanaugh was exactly accurate
when he said how much he drank
if you're evaluating to see if he was
exactly accurate about the meanings of
those words in high school
on his yearbook i said to you
he's talking to his family you cannot
judge a man
who's talking in front of his family
because if he's talking in front of his
family
and he's talking in front of you he's
not thinking about you you get that
right
if his family is in the room or you know
they're part of the audience
his family the people he cares the most
about it
his children his children
that he's trying to raise right trying
to be a good role model
if they're in the room he doesn't care
about you
do you want him to be different do you
want him to care about you
when his family's in the room i don't
i don't i want him to care about his
family
if he can sit in that room and care more
about me
or more about senator feinstein or even
more about getting the job
if he could care about any of those
things more then he would care about
you know the example he's setting for
his family the
the way that they exist as a cohesive
family unit
the way they think about themselves
their reputation
what experience the children would have
when they when they're dealing with
their friends
if you think he could ignore his family
in favor of giving the the technically
correct answer
about something trivial really his the
things he did when he was 17.
uh and i'm not talking about the alleged
allegation i'm talking about the
you know drinking in general and i'm
talking about the comments in general
on his yearbook so
to me and i didn't see anybody
call it out for what it was i haven't
seen anybody
until i'm doing it right now when
kavanaugh wrote that
editorial and he said my primary
audience was my family
let me interpret that if it wasn't
obvious to you let me interpret it
my primary audience was my family means
that on the little how much he
drank
did he black out did he say some
inappropriate things in a yearbook when
he was 17
he lied he just
admitted he lied and he told you why
in very clear language in my opinion now
apparently it wasn't clear enough
because i think i'm the first person
saying it
have you heard anybody else say this but
now that you hear it it's obvious right
once i explain it to you it's obvious
that when he says my primary
audience was my family he is explaining
that
that low-level stuff that everybody's
saying well
if he lied about how many beers he's had
he must have lied about raping somebody
or whatever he's not accused of rape
let's be clear about that um so
i believe he just told you the most
adult thing you've ever seen in your
life
think about it it's the most adult thing
anybody ever told you he just came out
and said
listen adults in his wall street journal
editorial i'm talking to you
adults because guess what he's saying
guess what
but
his children probably are not the
audience for the wall street journal
maybe they did because it's their dad in
this case but
he's talking to adults when he writes an
article in the wall street journal wall
street journal is for adults
he's talking to adults and he's saying
adults understand i was in public
but my primary audience for some of
these questions
for some of these questions my primary
audience
was my family is there anything else you
need to know
so if you're such a freaking idiot that
you're gonna say that he lied about how
much he drank
in front of his daughters and now that
he's told you
explicitly that's what he was doing i
think you have to see this in a
different light
the parent filter thank you
yes you have to put the parent filter on
this that's a perfect way to say it
he wasn't he wasn't
a judicial candidate or
candidate for the supreme court he was
not a supreme court nominee
every minute during that testimony
of course he is he was a supreme court
nominee
technically in every sense but
depending on the question he was
answering
he was he was changing his mode he was
putting his
his dad mode on there for a while and he
has a pretty long history
of showing that he's willing to give it
up for the kids if you know what i mean
right he coaches he he sacrifices for
them
so this is a guy you know gives it up
for the kids
we know that about him you know he's got
a long record of that
so keep it in context all right um
[Music]
so you may have seen that amy schumer
and
an actress that i don't know what she's
in but emily
radakowski ratajowski
so emily radokowski orzowski she's a i
guess she's a
well-known actress i don't know what she
does um
and amy schumer were protesting the
kavanaugh situation and they got
arrested
now here's a problem with hollywood
now i'm usually not the one who
rails against the uh the famous people
in hollywood
who have bad political opinions i
believe it is
true as a general statement that the
um the famous actors
it's famous hollywood people it does
seem to me that they're less informed
than the average person but maybe that's
an illusion because the average person
is pretty uninformed
but let me put it this way the hollywood
people seem consistently less informed
than the professional pundits who are
also on television talking about issues
on either side
so i'm not talking about which side
doesn't matter which side they're on
they're they are they're significantly
less informed
it seems than the average
hollywood celebrity now i usually go
easy
on them for the obvious reason that i'm
a little bit famous
you know i'm obviously better known for
being the creator of dilbert
and i would not want that same filter
i would not want the hollywood filter to
be put on me
because i think yeah this is my own
opinion of myself
your your mileage may may vary but i
feel like my
uh education and the way i approach
politics
is additive it's it's adding a little
something that wasn't there
now your opinion may differ but i don't
think i'm in the same category with
some of the the famous folks
so i normally go easy on them but here's
the problem
if your situation is a potential
uh drunken sexual assault and
that's what this all gets to right the
complaint is about
drunken sexual assault
who are you gonna send as your
representative
to speak out against drunken sexual
assault well i'm gonna pick as my worst
choice amy schumer what is she famous
for if you if you know her act
her famous her she's famous for talking
about getting inebriated and having
a lot of casual sex now i'm completely
in favor of both of those things
she can have as much casual sex as she
likes and i like her a lot as a
as an artist as a as a humorist um
yeah i'm a big fan i think she's
terrific and i have no complaints i have
no moral qualms
i don't have any you know i'm not
judging
her lifestyle and i don't even know if
her lifestyle
actually matches the things she says on
stage in any
important way so there's no judgment
here i'm not
judging her as a person not judging your
lifestyle
i'm more of a fan than anything else but
if you're gonna put a famous face
in front of let's not get drunk and have
uh too much groping she would be the
worst
choice right i'm certainly in favor of
her having a voice
and exercising her free speech and
trying to make a difference and
those are all good things and i think
she's well-meaning
so in my opinion she has no evil
intentions i think she has only
good meaning but i'm just saying as the
face
of this movement very bad
but if you think she's a bad choice and
again
good person good intentions just
as a match for this topic a bad choice
but it turns out emily ratajowski is
perhaps
a slightly worse choice even than that
and i don't know if you'll be able to
see it but i'm going to show you the
picture
uh let's see if i can do this
so here she is her sign says respect
female existence
or expect our resistance which is a lot
of words not as clever as it could be
but respect female
existence yeah this is this is what she
wore
so this is what she wore to the
protest against women being objectified
so here's my little protest tip if
you're protesting
about women being objectified
probably don't go like that probably
don't go like that
so
so all i'm saying is and again
i don't know this i don't know this
actress i don't know emily
reddick ratachowski kowski i don't even
know how to pronounce it
and i apologize to her for that i have
nothing bad to say about her
she i i believe she's probably a good
person
who thinks she's i'm doing the right
thing trying to help
i like people get involved i like all of
that and
oh and i even i respect the fact that
she obviously knows a lot about
diet and exercise and fitness so if you
were to ask me
my personal opinion of her i'd say well
pretty hot looks like she has lots of
talent
looks like she's done a good job with
her fitness
looks like looks like a pretty solid
citizen and she's getting involved
in an important issue i like all of that
all i'm saying is
all i'm saying is if you're going to put
a famous face on this movement
not your right choice unless you dress
down a little bit to make your point
all right so that's all i'm saying
so trump um
oh and let me clarify that because if
this is taken out of context
it's going to look worse than i mean it
i'm completely in favor of women wearing
anything they want
wherever they want so i don't have any
i have no problem with women dressing
any way they want
and i don't believe that that you know
gives anybody a right to attack them so
there's no there's no retrograde
thinking like that going on i'm just
saying that
for a branding purpose it's a little bit
off-brand that's all i'm saying
um trump went full soros today
he actually mentioned george soros being
a funder of
protests now you might wonder
and a lot of people have asked me this
why i don't talk about george soros
and i don't know what to think about all
the george soro stuff
my first my initial thoughts about it
all
was that it was just a conspiracy theory
on the right
and that you know yeah george soros
funds some organizations who are
involved in some things
and he likes different things and we
like but is it a big deal
or is it just a convenient you know
a convenient person to blame for stuff i
never really had a sense of it
and then if you try to look into it it's
the rabbit hole just
goes down forever and you can't really
tell what's true
because if you read anything uh
written on the right about george soros
you get
you know three sentences in and you
start scratching your head and you say
yeah i don't know how true any of this
is
it just didn't feel like it just feels
too
impossible to be true which doesn't mean
it's not true
it just it doesn't pass the sniff test
with me
but i'm sure it is true that he gives to
groups and some of that money
ends up in the protest groups that's
probably true
but i don't know how important it is and
then i say to myself
where is the dividing line between
um being active and funding things and
you know trying to be a good cause in
the world
where is it where's the dividing line
between that
and influencing an election from a
different country
if george soros is doing what he is
accused of being
of doing shouldn't the u.s be
sanctioning him
so here's where the disconnect is if we
don't
like other countries influencing our
elections
and he seems to be universally accused
of doing exactly that
by funding groups who are protesting and
clearly trying to
change the outcome of politics why isn't
that foreign
foreign interference and why aren't we
why isn't the u.s actively acting
against him
as we would if russia did it as we would
if
china did it so
so one of the reasons i don't talk about
the soro situation is that none of it
makes sense to me
it doesn't make sense that the people
who have the power
the trump administration and you know
their supporters
it doesn't make sense to me that we're
accusing them of all these things
but then we're acting as though they're
not happening
so what we're saying and what we're
doing don't seem to have any connection
so i'm hoping somebody can explain them
oh he's a u.s citizen soros is a u.s
citizen
where does he live though he doesn't
live in america does he
somebody told me where soros lives
i'll have to look that up soros
he's an american citizen but he was born
in hungary right
let's look him up here george
soros
i should dig deeper into sorrow scott i
think you underestimate him
well um here's my problem
the the problem is that when you dig
deeper into him you can't really be sure
that what you're reading is
true all right so
um he's a hungarian-american investor so
born in hungary
and then an american citizen as as as
you said
but does he live here
um he was born in budapest
his children relatives website
but where does he live and emigrated to
england
but where is he now
well let me ask you this he doesn't live
does he live in new york
now i can't believe that he lives in new
york and he's in favor of open borders
unless he plans to leave new york he's
in austria somebody says all right well
he probably
has a number of houses
but here's my question that i just
generated just now
if it is okay for soros
who is an american citizen as as you've
informed me
if it's okay for him to influence our
elections
directly would it be okay
if he lived in another country and did
it
suppose he was an american citizen and
he lived in russia
would it be okay for him to try to
influence our elections
if he lived in russia
right it's an interesting question isn't
it
let's say he lived in russia but he was
an american citizen could he do anything
he wanted them to influence our
elections
i'm not sure he could but maybe he could
i don't know it's sort of an interesting
question
but
he lives all over the world yeah
so he's financing a lot of people uh on
the
on the left well i guess i just have
more questions about soros and i don't
think we completely
understand what's going on with that um
now is it still true that there's a
senator who's planning to
he might miss the vote i think he's a
republican he might miss the vote on
kavanaugh because his daughter has a
wedding
is that still true uh because i saw i
heard it yesterday but then i didn't see
it
on the news so i'm going to say wedding
kavanagh sent it
or i forget which senator it was
uh oh senator daines
will be on saturday
and they might hold open the vote
overnight
all right so you've got a a republican
who's you know every vote is necessary
but here's a republican senator whose
daughter has a wedding on that day
what would you do what would you do
if your two choices were this your
daughter's wedding
that you really can't change you know
it's kind of hard-coded at this point
you got your daughter's wedding you can
be at or you can be the important
final vote to change the course of the
courts
for maybe generations in a way that your
side wants
what do you do what would you do would
you go to the wedding
if it were if it were your daughter
would you go to the wedding or would you
stay for the vote
if you had to choose he might not have
to choose
he said he'd vote um
here's what i'd do and i'm i'm just
gonna
i'm just gonna put my thing out there if
it were me i'd go to the wedding
if it were me i'd go to the wedding but
here's what i would also do
i would go to my democrat friends
and let let's say that by the time of
the vote everybody's already announced
their vote
so let's say that the undecided people
by the time of the vote
have already decided so that there's no
doubt
which way the vote will go at the last
minute when they actually vote
uh oh don jr fixed it because he's gonna
fly him or something
um but just hypothetically here
uh wouldn't senator daines
of the gop suppose he asked his democrat
friends once they knew that the vote was
going to go for a confirmation then
there was no doubt about it
but the only way it could happen is if
he
the only way it could happen is if
he got somebody who was a democrat to
vote for him
don't you think it would be completely
legitimate
to ask for a volunteer just one person
who is a democrat to vote his way
so that he can go for the wedding
wouldn't you like to see that now that
person would have
a little bit of a problem in their own
district
because in their own district they'd
have to explain no
it wasn't a real vote i was just voting
so this gop
guy could go to his daughter's wedding
it's it would be nice and maybe it could
work in favor of the person who did it
but here's a better suggestion if we get
to the point where we know which way the
vote's going to go
and the only difference is whether this
poor guy gets to go to his daughter's
wedding or he doesn't
if it came down to that and it looks
like maybe we've solved it so that won't
be a problem
but if it came down to that i think the
democrats should vote unanimously for a
confirmation
because if the if the democrats voted
unanimously for confirmation
no single democrat could be singled out
as the one who flipped
and it would be a bigger story and it
would say yeah we've had this huge
fight over this thing but
when it got down to the final thing
we're human beings
and the human thing to do would be to
preserve the vote the way the gop was
going to get it anyway if this poor guy
you know didn't stay for his daughter's
wedding and still let him go to the
wedding
because the the result is going to be
the same you still get the confirmation
of kavanaugh that's a done deal
but why not why not be nice people
why not give some cover for a colleague
it would be
tremendous just it would be just
tremendous
um you know a good look for the
democrats
because they would take the the human
element
as a priority and that that feels on
brand to them
and it would be a good collegial act i
don't see any of that happening by the
way
and it looks like it's solved but it's
fun to talk about
um the vote is over
somebody says
uh you'd have to trust them to do that
well
would you or would you just have them
come back and
do the whole thing again and vote him in
yeah i'm not i'm not saying any of
that's going to happen but it was
certainly would be the
it would be a fun and memorable and
uh and good for the world
votes are taken in alphabetical order
and he is danes so he's going to be
upfront
all right um
you just jumped the shark do you know
how many times
people have told me that i jumped the
shark
you can can you imagine
uh well first of all so dilbert is
entering its
30th year so for 30 years
i've been drawing dilbert and it's been
you know one of the
top comics in the world for most of that
30 years probably 25 of those years it
was one of the
top comics in the world and for
at least 25 years i get about
one message a week at minimum in which
somebody tells me
well now you jumped the shark you know
you were okay for those first four years
but
now you jumped the shark so for
30 years people have been telling me
well today you went too far
well it was okay yesterday but now
you've gone too far
so i always laugh when i see it because
if it's such a
such a low awareness comment in my case
um
let's talk about 3.7 unemployment
uh as we enter you know the let's say
the zone of the midterms
we're we're kind of now in the midterm
zone
meaning it's so close to the midterms
that that's all we're thinking about
it gets harder and harder to say that
the economy is all obama's
good work now i'm one of the few people
in the world
who is willing to say obama did a good
job
trump is also doing a good job yeah i
think it's possible to hold both of
those thoughts in your head when it
comes to the economy
they did different things and i think
different things had to be done at
different times
i think obama was probably a good fit
for this emergency situation because he
was a calm voice and the economy was
going off the edge
and you didn't want any extra risk
introduced into the system so he was
sort of a
calm standard voice
but once once things get moving along
pretty well
which obama did he got things moving
along pretty well along with just you
know the economy has its own cycles
uh but i think that trump's extra juice
of cutting
taxes cutting regulations you know uh
being sort of the the cheerleader in
chief for american industries
negotiating tariffs and all that stuff
i do think that added the extra juice he
was the one who put extra risk
into a system that was ready for extra
risk
so you don't want any extra risk in 2008
because the economy was on the precipice
it was ready to go off a cliff
but once you're strong you don't want
that same
calm voice obama would be exactly the
wrong
leader for 2018. he might have been
exactly the right leader
for 2008-2009 but today you need more of
a cheerleader you need a marketer you
need somebody to put a little
energy into it you need some juice you
need some enthusiasm you need some
optimism
and these are all these are all the
president trump's
you know bread and butter this is the
stuff he does
so i think he gets credit for um
you know for a strong and
not just strong performance but
innovative
when you say that president trump's
approach to the
economy in terms of his cheerleading
optimism
cutting regulations really his whole the
whole package of what he's doing
it seems to me innovative because we
haven't quite seen anybody who put
together this
package of economic ideas
breaking us senate votes to advance the
nomination
is that the case let's see let's see if
cnn agrees with you random person
cnn says the vote is underway
uh susan collins is a yes for now but
we'll announce her final decision later
i i think it's smart for all the people
who
uh the people who are undecided
now kavanaugh was not just confirmed i
believe the vote was for
cloture now uh
remember i told you before that we've
learned so much about our government
because of the the trump years did you
know what
cloture meant last week
how many of you knew what a vote
for cloture c-l-o-t-u-r-e
how many of you even knew what that was
a week ago
now my understanding is it's a vote to
close the debate
so that you can later have the real vote
so it's only a vote to stop arguing it's
not a vote
that's the final vote so this this vote
if it went the way that we think it did
or will
uh means that they've agreed to vote
tomorrow
why am i not watching the vote because
i'm doing this
i'm doing this and and i didn't think
there was any mystery about the cloture
for me it seemed that it was obvious
that they would vote they would vote to
have a vote
that part seemed easy to predict
um 51 to advance
all right that sounds
there are enough votes to advance they
just got 51 votes
mansion and murkowski flipped now vote
again
voting voting to close the debate
doesn't have to be the same as voting
for it because you could vote to close
the debate and then vote against the
the proposition there's nothing wrong
with that
so there's still a little bit of mystery
all right
let me ask you this
you know that i predicted from the start
you know that i predicted from the start
that kavanaugh would get confirmed
how many of you didn't believe that
because i think at this point it's
sort of a done deal uh
did did it did it help you at all
that i was confident in this and that my
predictions have been pretty good so far
so my my prediction was that
republicans would say unless there was
some new information about
kavanaugh's past my prediction was that
the republicans would go with
they would take the win and they would
look at the bigger picture which is we
can't have a world
in which this sort of accusation derails
somebody
so to me it seemed like they would favor
the bigger picture
and the bigger picture is you can't have
a world where
uncorroborated accusations of 17 year
old behavior
ruins your uh career when you're in your
50s
yes so they have agreed to the vote only
that is correct but i think
it's pretty safe to assume that the
vote's going to go in the same way
historically it's the litmus meaning
that if the cloture vote goes one way
the vote itself will go the
same way so the vote tomorrow at 4 pm
um you may be wondering where
i will be tomorrow at 4 pm because i
won't be
periscoping at 4 pm i will be delivering
the eulogy for my stepson my 18 year old
stepson
who died on sunday because of a
fentanyl overdose maybe from china
so fentanyl china the country of great
shame they should bow its head
in complete shame
is likely the cause of the death of my
stepson
not certainly but likely and
they must live with forever shame for
being that country
fentanyl china i'm always going to put
that name in front of them
they're just fentanyl china they're not
even china fentanyl
they're fentanyl china that's the first
thing you think about somebody who's
killing 30 000
of your people a year if china is
killing 30 000 people a year
or something like that with their
illegal fentanyl
um then i think fentanyl should be their
first name
not a good assumption says jp well
i don't know which one you're making but
apparently um
much of the illegal fentanyl comes from
china there's other stuff coming from
other places
south of the border as well i know
all right um
at three o'clock they will say their
vote what's that mean
will that make it into your eulogy no it
will not
all right thank you all for your good
thoughts and i'm gonna sign off
and i've gotta i have a eulogy for my
dead stepson to write so that's that's
my job today
and i'll talk to the rest of you later
