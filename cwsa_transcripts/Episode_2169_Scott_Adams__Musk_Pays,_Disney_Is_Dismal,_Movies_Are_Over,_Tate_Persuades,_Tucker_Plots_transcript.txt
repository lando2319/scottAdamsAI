foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of humans civilization
were already private on the locals
platform and talking to you also on
YouTube
you're all awesome
and might I add you look at the extra
sexy today
better than even yesterday and yesterday
you were killing it so if you'd like
your sex appeal and also your enjoyment
of this live stream to go to levels that
you didn't even know were possible well
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
attacker chalices dying the canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's called the
dopamine the other day it's a
simultaneous set when it happens now go
ah
well thank the
the gods of news who have delivered upon
us
oh a bounty it's a bounty of funny news
and interesting news
I don't want to be a spoiler
but it doesn't look like
goodbye
but it doesn't look like we're gonna
have World War III we'll get to that
if you're worried about World War III
probably not that's the spoiler all
right let's talk about other things
though
I've developed developed the best insult
for the year 2023. the best insult I've
been testing the sound I told you I was
going to test it and now I have an
outcome
absolutely nobody likes to hear this
Bob believes in the news
so if you really want to insult somebody
you go Bob
you believe in the news
now I would recommend that you only use
this
for somebody's name is Bob
I don't really have anything that would
work with other names but this would
work really well if your name is Bob
Bob leaves the news and just walk away
there's nobody who can respond to that
you have to try it out the next time
you're debating about something in the
news political just look at the person
and say so Bob you believe the news
and then Bob will say something like
well you know I do my own research and
and I look at multiple sites and I talk
talk to people and then you just look at
him say
but in the end
you believe the news
that's it that's the whole technique
right there
well uh looks like actors and writers
are going on strike Hollywood actors and
writers first time since 1960.
and so we will not be
we will not be gifted with the greatness
of their products so you know maybe they
won't be making more movies right away
and uh I can't tell you how different my
life would be
if I didn't occasionally have to sit
through three hours of that I
imagined was going to be good but I was
Fooled Again
I think the world would be worse without
movies
I mean I realize this is
heretical
but I don't think we need them
don't think we need them
I said the same thing about all the
species that were becoming extinct
think about your your past week you know
out of the past week go for you do you
remember that time this past week when
you said everything would be good except
for you know the dodo was extinct
because I was going to have dodo you
know barbecue and there's no dodos so my
life is ruined because of the animals
that have gone extinct now I'm not in
favor of animals going extinct if he
could stop it that'd be great be great
but I just want to point out you you
have not missed any animals
there's not a single animal that you've
said to yourself if only
if only those specific animals were
still here you know that bird with a
funny head
things were good when we had that bird
but not not anymore no it's like that
you would never miss movies
if they stopped forever today
you would you would miss the habit
you would miss the habit but then you
would replace it with something
healthier
hahaha
you would not be worse off with no
movies
so
um and by the way I can say that about
myself
I don't believe that getting canceled in
newspapers globally
is you know desperately injuring the
people who would have been reading it
otherwise the entertainment's pretty
optional turns out if you have other
sources
all right um
the the funniest news from yesterday
which is kind of awesome is that Twitter
had
started mailing out checks to people who
were not expecting any checks
so it's the the bigger accounts that
we're getting lots of Engagement
musk had promised that he would start
paying people for engagement because
they could run ads in your comments
which is a much better place to put an
ad
because you're not going to see it
unless you're you know interested in
that comment
well some people I saw I saw one tweet
of somebody who got over nine hundred
thousand dollars
Matt Wallace
I don't know who Matt Wallace is but is
that true
maybe maybe it was like a
it doesn't seem possible I don't think
the math works because how much
engagement would you have to have to get
that
um other people were getting I think 10
pools and he got five thousand dollars
krasenstein's got twenty five thousand
dollars
um I don't I didn't get any notice that
I noticed
they were all they were all uh tweeting
this little notice getting paid I don't
think I have but it might also be
because I didn't start my subscription
service as soon as they did so maybe
maybe I get paid uh allegedly I would
so here's the funniest thing about this
so just when people were going to
threads
you know the competition to Twitter
uh Elon Musk comes up with a plan
to monetize your critics
that's right the more trolls that come
into my Tweet now and they yell at me
and call me a racist or whatever they
want to call me the more money I make
and the funniest thing about this was
Mike cernovich's reaction so many of you
know Mike cernovich from Twitter and you
see one of the biggest bigger accounts
he's over a million and
uh he's most famous on Twitter for being
the most aggressive Blocker of trolls
and and he commented you know damn it I
have to unblock 25 000 people now so
they can help mine me money on Twitter
and he coined the term using the trolls
to mine money on Twitter I love that I
love that term
so uh
let me remind you that the number one
factor in success is just pure luck
so certavich decides to make that sort
of almost a brand that he blocks people
and that it turns out that maybe he
could have made a lot more money if he
didn't he'll do fine either way because
he gets a lot of Engagement
but I thought that was funny
um
I
I I'm going to contrast this to you just
because it's funny
on Twitter someone asked me
if I had been doing affirmations about
creating a new uh source of cash flow
because this just snuck up on me I
wasn't expecting it just one day
apparently I'm eligible for money that I
wasn't expecting
and the answer is yes
I I only I only have one affirmation
going and the affirmation is that a
magical source of cash flow would open
up one that I was not aware of
and that happened yesterday
how often does that ever happen to you
Have You Ever Had An Unexpected source
of cash flow open up this never happened
to me I mean not like that
so yes that was actually my affirmation
that specific thing and it just appeared
now
let me give you a little background
I don't believe affirmations are magic
and I don't believe I necessarily
authored my environment because it seems
to have affected other people too
I doubt I did that but
um
it is the weird coincidences which you
appear to have when you're doing an
affirmation is just mind-boggling I've
been doing it all my life and one
coincidence after another we'll just
plop into your lap when you're doing
affirmations I don't know why it could
be because reality is subjective it
could be that you literally just imagine
a different path in your reality that is
no more or less real than the one you
were on this is different so maybe it's
just that maybe all possibilities exist
in the in it like a steady state like
every path exists and the only thing
that's moving is your consciousness
you know weaving through the various
four-dimensional reality
Maybe
maybe I always think of Consciousness
like
um the control point in a program if
you're executing a computer program
it doesn't all execute it once right it
executes certain you know a logical
sequence but I always think that that
point of execution
if the computer program could be could
have feelings like oh I'm now at this
point I'm would have Consciousness all
you'd have to do is tell the program as
a Feeling
associated with you know the specific
place that it's executing and if it felt
different in different parts of that
execution
it would be conscious
all right
um
Tucker Carlson is reportedly creating a
New Media company and trying to raise
hundreds of millions of dollars and he
would run that Media company on Twitter
so Twitter is beefing up its video
services and now allows long form for
some some bigger accounts I guess and
Tucker is looking to build his Media
company that would run on Twitter and
the reason he would run it on Twitter
instead of
YouTube
is censorship
censorship
so one of the things that Elon Musk has
created is a safe place for creators
which is also paying them
and I also wonder if my incentives will
change
I feel like they will I feel like they
will because I spent much of yesterday
you know I couldn't even get out of my
head thinking about the worst thing I
could tweet that would get the most
engagement
because now that's monetized
and I have to talk myself out of it all
morning long I've been talking myself
out of it yeah I'm coming back with my
full cup of coffee to start the show and
I'm thinking of a tweet
I think I'm going to say
that
Taylor and Lorenz is the hottest woman
on Twitter
just because I don't get a lot of
Engagement I barely know what she looks
like I just know people are really mad
at her right now that's all it would
take and but I didn't do it I didn't do
it because it's it's not creative
you know if you do creative things for a
living you have these sort of standards
that develop accidentally where you go
Ah that's not creative enough so if I
were to immediately go out and just do
troll bait tweets I would not feel good
about myself even if even if I made
money because it would be so uncreative
to do that
however
uh I don't know if you noticed that Mr
Beast
who is an enormous social media presence
if you're not aware of him uh Mr Beast
on YouTube and Twitter just one of the
biggest accounts of all time he's just
legendary legendarily gigantic social
media presence
and he said that he would
he would give the money from his
engagement this month to whoever had the
most engagement on the comments to his
tweet
so all the people jumped in with you
know trying to compete for because if
you got one month
of Mr BEAST's uh Twitter money I don't
know what that would be
but it's a big number
and he makes so many millions a year
that he could you know he could give
away a million dollars it wouldn't he
wouldn't even touch him so
I thought damn it I think I can compete
for this
you know my my competitive juices were
just automatically triggered because
it's a contest
and Mr B says 22 million followers
22 million
22 million followers
that's a lot anyway
uh I decided to enter the contest
meaning I made a comment that I hope to
get a lot of tweets and uh I got
absolutely Smoked by Bill Pulte
Bill Pulte just comes in and says he'll
donate the money and I'm like oh I can't
beat that come on bill so I think his
engagement or something like 50 times
mine all that all I did was post my
Dilbert reborn comic today uh about the
outcome of the cage match between
Dilbert's CEO and another CEO
I won't say it on YouTube but let's just
say it definitely wouldn't run in a
newspaper so you'd have to look at it
yourself if you want to see it I took it
outside the pay wall just just to
compete normally you wouldn't be able to
see Dilbert Reborns be on the paywall
but
if you go to the Mr Beast tweet
you can find it there
possibly the funniest thing I've ever
written I actually think that's true
that the comic I put under Mr beats Mr
BEAST's tweet it might be the funniest
thing I've ever read it's just me
so your mileage will differ
um so Tucker Carlson starting this
company it looks like they might get
some other hosts
who who do you think Tucker is going to
recruit
if Tucker Carlson starts his own you
know thing with other hosts
who would he recruit
you know because because the problem is
everybody who is notable already has a
pretty good job
right you know that the people working
at Fox News
could they really imagine that they
would get a bigger paycheck doing this
I don't know and you know other names I
hear you say they already have their own
thing you know Glenn Greenwald already
has his own thing uh Dan bongino his own
thing Megan Kelly her own thing so there
are there actually aren't that well
Herald though there actually aren't that
many people
who were big name
um let's say voices in the political
realm who are also looking for a job
because one of the thing that makes you
that prominent is that you have a
platform that's already working
so it's gonna be tough it's going to be
tough to recruit but wouldn't it be
interesting if he recruited Young
you know let's say he looked on Twitter
and found the people who were just
killing it on Twitter but don't have
their own platform yet
that'll be fun
yeah that'd be really fun
so we'll keep an eye on that
uh Zero Hedge tweeted that the use of
threads the competitor to Twitter is
down 20 from Saturday and user time
spent is down 50 percent
now I have not checked threads in a few
days I did sign up just to see what it's
all about
haven't felt any need to check it in two
days I've checked Twitter 400 times
why the difference well here's a here's
the mistake that Zuckerberg made which
sounded like the smartest thing he did
which might have turned into the dumbest
thing he did
so one of the features when you sign up
for Threads is that you can
automatically bring all of your follows
over not the people who follow you but
the people you follow you can bring over
to threads
so I brought all the people that I
follow because they look good and they
have good pictures because that's what I
do on Instagram if your pictures are
good for whatever reason
I follow you maybe it's attractive
people I want to look at
could be that and so I bring all these
people over and then I see what happens
when they're forced to produce content
that's only text
it didn't go well
it's some of the worst Tweeting or
threading you've ever seen in your life
all the people who who look amazing
when they have to talk
it all just goes it all goes right the
 away they don't have anything it is
so amazingly uninteresting to read the
threads from the same people that I I
happily follow on Instagram and we'll
continue to their Instagram posts are
great yeah there was a reason I followed
them but boy when they start talking
there's nothing to see there
there's just nothing there the a typical
tweet would be like
I don't know if I should wear socks
today
okay
all right all right
let's talk about your socks
so uh as I tweeted about that it turns
out the movie my Instagram followers to
threads did not give me the Algonquin
Roundtable effect I was hoping to
achieve
now I'd like to look to the five percent
of you who understood that joke for a
reaction
anybody understand that joke
Algonquin Round Table
all right some of you got it good the
rest of you will just have to Google it
the Algonquin Round Table add that add
that to your uh snooty vocabulary
there's some things that if you know
them it sort of signifies you know that
you're sort of a well-informed person
it's like the use of the word zeitgeist
or eponymous eponymous I couldn't even
say it if you ever use the word
eponymous
or a zeitgeist
or Algonquin Roundtable
or schadenfreude shot in Freud thank you
excellent one if you use any of those
words in normal conversation
you're kind of a douchebag
you know talking about myself because I
do use them kind of a douchebag because
there's a very high likelihood that the
person you're talking to doesn't know
what those words mean you know in a
normal American Circle
five percent would know what all those
words mean maximum when you say five
percent would know all of those terms no
more than that so if you learn them
oh yeah and uh solemn solipsistic
if you learn those little terms you can
you can spoof as though you're Highly
Educated even if you're not it works
every time
all right what else is going on uh
Disney's business is slumping
um of course you're going to say is it
because of the fight with DeSantis and
is it because of politics and their
wokeness is that why they're having low
traffic in their theme parks and their
movies from Pixar are not doing well is
that why what do you think
do you do you think Disney is suffering
because of wokeness
I'm gonna say no
you're gonna say no
I'm just going to make a hypothesis
what could it be what could it be uh
what would cause Disney to slump
I I got it I got it I got it they made
movies
they made movies
suck
all of them they pretty much all suck
and they have a theme park
that if you were to put the entire
experience of the entire day at the
theme park it would be about equal to
five minutes of strolling on a
smartphone
scrolling not scrolling yeah
who goes to who goes to a Disney theme
park
um masochists
if you went to a Disney theme park isn't
it mostly standing in the sweltering
heat waiting for something that wasn't
that good in the first place and then
when you're done
you go wait in the sweltering heat for
yet another thing that you didn't want
to do in the first place
because you have children
who in the world does that voluntarily
you know this the news should not be
that their business is slumping the news
should be that somehow they built a
business on this
now I get in the old days this was
pretty interesting stuff Ooh It's a
Small World After All are you kidding I
didn't know that it's a small world
after all and they're singing look look
they're animatronic and they're boats
and they're singing they're singing oh
my God oh my God oh
it's not really the thrill it used to be
so I would think that Disney's biggest
problem is they make nobody wants
am I wrong about that
your kids enjoy it do you know what kids
enjoy
kids enjoy anything that's got bright
lights and and junk food
hey kids I'm going to take you to a
place that's got a lot of bright lights
and colors and junk food
can we eat good healthy food there too
nope don't even have any actually they
probably do but kids don't want it
um yeah kids are delighted to go
anywhere that they can run around have a
little freedom and eat some junk food
so yeah the kids love it
they don't love it as much as playing on
their iPad
but they love it
naturally they do probably love it more
than their iPad but
um I think the direction of Disney is
clear unless they do something pretty
radical I don't imagine I can't imagine
their business model working in the long
run unless they change it quite a bit
all right uh so a little clip of a
congresswoman summer Lee
representative summer Lee I would like
to first uh
compliment summer Lee congresswoman
summer Lee for having one of the best
names
of people who've ever been named
you know summer is a pretty good name
but Lee is an excellent last name to go
his summer
Summer League
am I wrong that's like one of the best
names I've ever heard
like I always wonder if that actually
affects your life
to have a name that people really really
like to say like I'll probably say that
name like to myself later when I'm
thinking about summerly it's like a
perfect name
anyway so that's not what the story is
about summer Lee pointed out in a tweet
and I guess she was talking in Congress
grilling somebody and said how much does
military the military spend on Viagra
each year
and the director of Defense contract
said I don't have that figured out and
but summerly did have it figured out and
answered her own question
41.6 million dollars spent by the
military every year for Viagra and then
she pointed out some early did a name I
just can't stop saying Summer League
do you know how many bridges in my
district of Pittsburgh could be repaired
with that amount it turns out it's I
think it's two Bridges you could fix two
Bridges
for the amount that the military spends
on Viagra
and so I introduced the hashtag Bridges
not boners
we'll see if that Trends Bridges not
Motors
um
and the thing that you should be worried
about is uh
military
our military vulnerability
yeah our military boner ability
I said it
I'm not embarrassed no I said it I said
it twice
um I stole that one from I stole that
one from somebody on Twitter that wasn't
my own work
and uh
I would just I would like to add a
Counterpoint the counter point to this
that it seems to me that's 42 million
dollars well spent
because you know what I don't want
maybe this is just me I'd like to get a
get a feel from the audience
I don't really want a military that
can't get hard
was that just me
is anybody with me I'm in a military
that's rock hard all the time and ready
to rock
they'll fight her little you know
and if and if you interrupt them after
they've taken the Viagra but before they
do the thing they want to do well
they'll fight
I like them angry and urgent
harder the better I think that's the
best money we're spending I want these
guys to be saluting at all times if you
know what I mean and I think you know
what I mean
right
so summerly you're awesome however I do
like uh
I like a hard military is what I'm
saying
it takes Hard Men Hard Men to fix things
sometimes
well CNN is directly going after Biden
in ways that you would not imagine they
would do unless they really don't want
him to run for office
all right so you don't expect CNN to
just directly go after the the Democrat
but they did and they're they're it's
the kind of story that seems designed to
take him out of the office
see if you think this is just
unbiased news because they're
criticizing their own side in a sense is
it just unbiased news and and welcome
or is it clearly designed to remove him
from office
right so
the article is about how the the big
donors are worried that he is not worth
the money
if you want to kill somebody's campaign
run a story on CNN the one that
everybody on your team is aware of and
tell them that big donors other big
donors yeah although I'm not going to
name them odd the names of the big
donors no I'm not going to give you the
names of them but trust me trust me I've
talked to people those big donors who I
won't name are very hesitant they're
looking for somebody else to give money
to now if you were a big donor also
and you were on the verge of giving
Biden a lot of money and you read in CNN
that other big donors have decided they
might not or are not
wouldn't your money feel wasted
that's the play
the play is to make the other donors
think they're wasting their money
by saying that there's so much doubt and
he might not run he might be replaced
and and the big donors when they say big
donors do you know what the synonym for
that is they don't say it out loud
big donor
equals what big donor not just victory
but
no not lobbyist big donor equals
smart
smart because people assume that the the
billionaire class and the big donors are
going to do their homework that's the
group that's making damn sure they know
who to give their money to because it's
a lot of money and they're you know
smart high high functioning people who
are not just guessing
they're doing good risk analysis and
they know where their money's going so
if you say all the if you say oh I don't
know if you knew this but the smart big
donors the Smart Ones the smart
billionaires they've decided not to give
money to Joe Biden
so I mean you can if you want I mean
that's up to you it's a free world you
can give your money to anybody you want
but the Smart Ones
Smart Ones they've already decided not
to now you tell me I'm exaggerating I'm
you know that's hyperbole the article
doesn't go that far but
don't you think this article is designed
to take him out
you know and of course they mentioned
you know people are looking at the
Alternatives and all that it feels like
it's designed only for that purpose it
does not feel like news it doesn't even
have the the vibe of we just wanted to
inform you as a citizen nothing like
that it just feels like a play
an actual op instead of news
all right
um
let's see what else is going on
um
Michael schellenberger tweeted this
there's a some entity called public
I don't know who they are but they some
some kind of uh publication or entity
but jellenberger is tweeting that Biden
and the FBI suggest that domestic
terrorism is increasing but it's not and
now a new investigation by public
whoever they are reveals that the FBI is
deliberately stoking domestic extremism
and white supremacy in order to paint
Republicans as terrorists
now I'm not going to say that this is
confirmed to the level that I feel
comfortable with it but on the other
hand
schellenberger
isn't wrong a lot
if at all and I can't think of an
example but
anyway he thought it was credible enough
to retweet it I would put a little
Caution on it you know just just put a
little skepticism on whether public has
the goods but it's a report
and
it does you know here's the problem I
guess here's the problem this has to
work both ways it feels too on the nose
doesn't it if the politics of this were
reversed that's the first thing I tell
you that's a little that's like exactly
what you suspected isn't that a little
on the nose
might be true
might be exactly true
but it has that feel like things that
aren't true
you know what I mean if you just use
pattern recognition
it looks like maybe somebody's
stretching the story a little bit
but it's also possibly completely true
so the fact that we don't know if we can
trust our FBI to be working for the
public or actively against it you know
by playing in politics I would call that
actively working against the public
isn't that weird you act we actually
don't know
if the FBI is actively working for or
against the public
that's pretty scary
anyway
so it does seem to me the white
supremacy is the new hoax
so maybe I should add that to my hoax
list FBI white supremacy hoax
what do you think
I think we should go away Supremacy a
hoax at this point
now
you know how the argument always goes
right
the the side that disagrees with you
will tell you if there are three white
supremacists in a group of 80 million
all 80 million are Vice premises
right that that's where we go next so
next we go there well if you have two or
three in that group of 80 million
probably probably the whole group's
White supremacists and
you know where it's going there's not
going to be a question but if the rate
apparently there's some jiggering with
the numbers to make it look like the
white supremacy was worse than that was
and that maybe that was intentional
it's scary but we don't know how much is
real
so there was a story today about a
Republican
or representative who is speaking in
Congress and he
he used the phrase colored people
a black woman whose name
insisted that that be stricken from
and then the the individual who said it
realizing that he had missoken said he
would like to revise the record from
colored people to people of color
does that sound reasonable
he immediately went up no no no argument
no argument he immediately went up and
said I'd like to revise that to people
of color
and then the woman who is challenging it
said that's unacceptable she wants to
just take it out of the record
I don't know why because I feel like
amending it would get her more than
taking it out
because amending the record if there's
any record of I don't know if they keep
a record of what God amended
wouldn't it be better to show the path
to show the you said something you
misspoke you corrected it move on with
your life
all right here is my overall opinion on
this topic
don't care
don't care
do you know why
the reason I don't care is because black
Americans have been promoted recently to
full citizenship and full respect
full respect
full citizenship that just happened with
the the Africa the affirmative action
thing being overturned once you have
full
full citizenship for the first time in
my opinion
we don't care about this
now it doesn't matter
nobody cares
nobody cares that you were offended by
it
do you know why
because if a if a white person had been
offended in let's say the same fashion
nobody give a about that white guy
nobody
how about an Asian American was offended
in the same way I don't give a do
you
I don't care who got offended by
something that was just clearly
misspeaking
no care at all and the reason I don't
care is not because I don't care
it's because you've been promoted
is is literally because black lives
matter
I can't agree with you more
that you need the full respect of a full
citizen
take it
we're offering it I mean the whole world
is offering it just take it you'll love
it
have you ever seen the uh there were
studies I don't know if there's science
backs us but I believe I believe it has
been studied many times
that if you take students and tell them
they're good at math
they get good grades
if you take students and tell them
they're bad at math
they don't because they think they're
bad at math they get bad grades
relatively speaking now if that's true
then the ending of affirmative action
should
in the long run have the effect of
making everybody think that they could
be good at math you know if somebody
tells them they're good at math
so I think the end of affirmative action
is an insanely positive thing for Black
America
that looks like an insanely bad thing at
the moment I get that there are
certainly individuals who are maybe
counting on you know rules being
different
and got disappointed and that's a real
thing that's a real problem
but overall
the the full respect of being a full
citizen of the United States is way more
important that'll get you more in the
long run make you feel better make you
perform better make everybody like you
better it's all good it just doesn't
feel like it in the short run
well more to this point 13 attorney
generals from different states 13 states
uh
uh sent a message to their
states that the affirmative action
decision that applied to colleges
must also be applied to corporations and
businesses
and the thinking is that if the Supreme
Court found racial preference to be
illegal in the context of
uh colleges
obviously it would be also equally as
illegal if businesses were doing exactly
the same thing
so there's 13 states that just says it's
illegal
to do anything that even has the effect
of affirmative action
and specifically in those 13 states
Dei
is dead
because the AG has just turned it off
they just made it illegal to have a
diversity equity and inclusion
Department
well you could have the department I
suppose but you couldn't actually do
anything that changed the mix of people
so the Dei couldn't do the job of the
Dei I mean the the essential part uh in
13 states that's illegal now
goodbye Dei now of course these are you
know will be 13 most conservative States
I assume I didn't see the list
Tendencies on the list I think so that
should give you a hints
um don't know if more more States will
join
but
I think they might
yeah it could stay at 13.
well Biden found some new technical way
to cancel a bunch of student debts not
all of it but a big old chunk of it has
something to do with and this is what
you can do by executive order it took me
a long time to figure out
why an executive order can work
when it's not Congress and it's not a
law like why can you just say the
executive the president can just change
stuff
you know I saw Congress is the only one
who could do that but the details are
that if the law allows the the federal
government and the the president to
manage something
then that president can manage that
thing as long as it's within the bounds
of the law according to you know a
number of subjective or different you
know technical ways to get it done
so the trick is that you have to write
your
executive order
so that it looks like you're just making
a technical operational
administrative change but it doesn't
affect the law itself the law is still
the law and you're still obeying it
you're just you're just modifying how
you're observing it or or implementing
it so apparently they found some
technicality where
people
got billed more than they should have or
at least you could Define it that way or
you could interpret it that way and so
they're going to use that technicality
to make a bunch of mostly interest
payment go away I think
I don't know what to think about this
because you'd have to see the technical
argument and I didn't
but if it's true that these people were
paying
money that obviously they didn't need to
well then we need to fix that and then
that would be a good thing that he's
doing but I don't know if that's the
case you know maybe it's just a
technicality to make it make you sound
like he did more than he did
well if you were following social media
today you saw some frightened people say
that Biden is calling up reserves in the
U.S
and the worry would be that the reserves
are being called up because of Ukraine
and that it's a you know a preparation
step toward putting boots on the ground
American boots in the ground to Ukraine
which I think we all think is the worst
idea of all time
but also I was reading a tweet thread by
Joshua Steinman who you should follow
really good follow if you want to know
what's going on Joshua Steinman and uh
he had he had some experience in this
domain
and explained the you know the different
various reserves and who's a who's a
weekend reserve and who's a coast guard
and National Guard and I don't know so
he kind of broke down what all the parts
are and how they move
and then his takeaway was it probably
was not related to Ukraine
is more likely related he's speculating
but based on his experience which seemed
you know directly applicable to the the
topic he thinks there's more about
Talent retention because the military is
having a talent retention problem and he
thought that the move might be getting
at that although that's unconfirmed but
it doesn't look like an obvious thing
you would do to get ready to put boots
on the ground in Ukraine
can we all agree that we're not going to
put boots on the ground in Ukraine and
when I say let's agree I mean we can
stop that from happening
right the the public can absolutely stop
that from happening
if we want to
if we don't want to we won't but if we
want to we can absolutely stop it it's
not up to Biden you know he's going to
have to bow to the public if the public
is 80 against it
it's just not going to happen
but you'd probably have to get to about
80 percent
all right the 50 50 won't get it done
um so I wouldn't worry about World War
III just yet
uh India is launching a second attempt
to put a Rover on the moon
boy you know I had not been paying
attention to India at all when it comes
to space
but I don't know if you've heard this
this might be the first time you've
heard this but
there are some good Indian engineers
did anybody know that yeah they got
really good they got smarter people they
got really really good engineers and
they launched a rocket I I haven't heard
yet if there's any problem with it so
far so good
I would love to see another Rover on the
moon and I would love it to be an ally
that would be ideal
so keep an eye on India and space and I
also think it's important that India
might want to you know get a get a
foothold on the moon
because the moon is going to be a
battlefield you know that right
the the odds that we're never going to
have a war on the moon are pretty low
because because the moon's sort of the
the ultimate space Attack Base for Earth
yeah if you wanted to have like a a
military base on the moon someday
that feels like it would be a good play
you know someday I can imagine them you
know a spaceship that does nothing but
you know drag giant Boulders you know
into our atmosphere from Mars and just
release them
yeah but figure out where they're gonna
land so it's like a rocket if they don't
burn up
that's the worst idea I've had lately
all right
I saw on uh I think it was in the hill
or something that Trump is less popular
than uh Kamala Harris in the whole
country
do you think that's true
do you think Trump is less popular than
Kamala Harris
might be might be true
so
do you really want another four years of
being called a white supremacist and a
monster just because of trump
I feel like he's the only candidate that
would make his
make his supporters look like
I mean it happened the first time I mean
it was devastating for anybody who
supported him they were just demonized
as as racist but if you know if Tim
Scott is the candidate
I have a good four years
no matter what happens of good four
years if Trump's a candidate I'm going
to get a lot of trouble
like there's just a lot of trouble to
come my way and I'm even endorsing Rama
Swami and I'm still
if I say anything positive about his
persuasion or something I'm still going
to give just villainized for all that do
I need that
I don't really need it but I also object
to the fact that the Democrats would
make me
you know try to support somebody
different because they're going to put
pressure on me
they're going to put pressure on me
that's not cool
you you can put pressure on the
candidate as much as you want they
signed up for that but if you come after
me
because I have a political preference
that's not cool at all
yeah not cool at all
so we'll see what happens
um
so the conversation about whether we're
experiencing something called a woke
mind virus I was actually in a
conversation with somebody who does a
great job of looking at both the left
and the right
and insists that the woke mind virus is
a Illusion by the right
that there's no such thing
and then I said well do you believe that
let's say the trans situation would be
exactly the same except for the
psychology of the current situation
and I didn't get quite a good answer to
that but it seems to me it's obviously a
woke mind virus and it's and it's
operating exactly like a virus in that
it you catch it from other people
you know they have to talk to you about
it and
it's spreading
so if you get it from other people and
it's spreading is that wrong to call
that a mind virus it's not a physical
virus but obviously it's a mental
process that's spreading from one to
another it has negative effects
I mean I think awoke mind virus fits
perfectly and is observable and
scientifically measurable and the data
supports it
to me it's the most obviously true thing
in politics you like TDS right
but um
so I saw a little uh back and forth
by I saw at first it was a tweet that
Jordan Peterson was
um boosted and the Tweet said Megan Fox
has three boys
Charlize Theron adopted two boys both
are woke Hollywood stars both are
unmarried white women both have sons
identifying as girls and then this tweet
said it doesn't take a rocket scientist
so in other words it was suggesting that
these children would not have made these
choices except that their parents are
woke White
liberals and single and single and you
know that the the implication is Dad
wouldn't let wouldn't let them do that
I don't know about the dad part
but uh then I saw a tweet by Jordan
Peterson who calculated the odds
so he did the odds what are the odds
that you would have two non-binaries or
you know two kids who think they're in
the wrong gender
and it's like you know one uh you know
hundreds of billions or something like
that just crazy odds
but I would like to add the following
thing
um I've talked about the McMartin School
uh preschool case before I think it was
70s
or 80s I forget was it 80s or 80s yeah
it was in the 80s and the the famous
case just to remind you it's well well
documented you can see it on Wikipedia
is that there was a preschool in which
there were allegations that the children
were being uh
tortured and used in Satanic rituals and
that there was a basement under the
school in which they took the kids and
did all kinds of you know very elaborate
rituals and everything and the reason
that they were accused of this is that
that's what the children said
so when the children were interviewed
they said oh yeah we're taken
underground and these bad things happen
and they touched me and you get hurt and
blah blah blah and one child after
another
had a story that had these same satanic
elements and so it went to trial
they the people who owned the school had
to go to trial to defend themselves
against being satanists which which they
had no connection to whatsoever
no connection to Satanism whatsoever but
yet they were really Satan satanists and
they had a secret basement under the
school now think about this they went to
trial
even after was discovered that the
school has no basement
pretty much most of the charges involved
being taken into the basement which
didn't exist
and everybody agreed it didn't exist
well the good news is that the Meg
Martin's school defendants they won
you know they won completely because it
was literally no physical evidence
or anything to back up the children
but then you say to yourself but the
children are not nothing right you had
lots of children
and and they were telling similarly
terrible stories you can't ignore that
right
well here's how we figured out how to
ignore it
intelligently which is uh people who
knew what they were talking about people
with actual the right kind of skills
looked at the videos of the
investigators interviewing the children
and they they learned very quickly that
the investigators who were putting the
ideas into the children's minds and at
that age and when you put them in this
like high pressure situation where
they're alone talking to a cop
imagine being a little kid alone
being interviewed by adults about
something pretty important
apparently you can get the kids to agree
to whatever it is you think that they
should be agreeing to and that's what
happened so the explanation of the
mcbarton school preschool case is that
children can be really easily hypnotized
brainwashed to saying things that are
completely untrue
so long as the person asking the
questions is leading them so it's not
about asking the questions it's about
leading them so the difference is would
be this so if you didn't leave them you
say hey little Bobby
um is there anything happening in your
school that we should know about
you know do you is there anything that
worries you have you heard any stories
you know something like that
might might not be leading them
depending on what else they've the kid
had heard about the situation right but
if you say
were you taken into a secret basement
and the child says no
nobody nobody said why don't you come
down here and you know you'll enjoy this
no
but
so the head of the preschool never said
to you that we have a place we go you
know location a room in which we'd like
to take you
well you okay yeah yeah
and was that the basement
yeah yeah yeah those basements and what
did you do down there that was satanic
what satanic what satanic things did he
do in the basement
I didn't do any satanic things in the
basement well but did anybody put you on
a table
and have like a you know blood or
something
well yeah yeah yeah I was put on a table
so that's what happens when you when
somebody in power
uh interviews a very young kid
remember this is preschool
preschool these are really little kids
and those kids just they they will adopt
a fantasy as a reality without even
really being too aware of the crossover
point
it's really dangerous children can be
hypnotized by their environment
they can be hypnotized by questions they
can be hypnotized by simply reading the
intention of their parents they can be
hypnotized by overhearing the
conversation
that's all it takes they just have to
overhear a conversation and a little kid
can be completely hypnotized
so if you're asking me is the you know
sudden spike in number of trans kids and
gender confusion is it caused by
something in the environment
specifically the way people talk about
it
yes
I can tell you I'm an expert in this
domain meaning persuasion and it's
obvious
right
um Jordan Peterson is an expert in this
domain
when he talks about it he's not guessing
he's not guessing he does know he
literally knows this is not an opinion
I mean it's well I mean I suppose you
could you could call an opinion but
there's no way he's wrong about this
this is this is solidly right in the
middle of his sweet spot right so if
your job is plumber and you're
disagreeing with him stop it stop it
he's not arguing with you about the
plumbing don't argue with him about how
brains work
that's not smart go fix your plumbing he
won't he won't tell you your plumbing is
wrong you just don't tell him
his cognitive behavior stuff is wrong
so yes it's very obvious you know I
don't know about these particular
Hollywood women I'm not I'm not saying
that I know anything about their
specific situations but it's very
obvious that children are being
brainwashed into gender confusion very
obvious there may also be other things
when RFK Jr talks about maybe something
in the environment
could be
what's that called atrazine
there's some chemical in the water that
turns frogs into female frogs or
something
but I would certainly look into that
atrazine stuff
you know you could imagine that there's
an interplay of two forces one force is
changing the chemical
balance of the children and the other
horses the hypnosis and one one makes
the other easier
very very easy to imagine that that's
happening don't know but very easy to
imagine it and just a preview in
tomorrow's Dilbert reborn which will not
be public for only the subscribers will
see it see if you can subscribe either
on Twitter or the locals
platforms.locals.com
but anyway tomorrow's Dilbert reborn
comic
features uh Dilbert CEO
who lost a cage match with another CEO
and apparently they had a bet and so
that boss has to marry the other CEO
even though Dilbert's boss is not gay
so he's trying to figure out how he can
pay off his Bat up and burying the other
CEO while not being gay
and so dilber recommends atrazine
so the CEO trisomatrazine
and if you want to know what happens
after that you better subscribe
there's my commercial for the day
uh I saw Jim Jordan tweeting that Joe
Biden's FTC wanted Ernst young to punish
musk's Twitter
in other words the FTC was putting
pressure on the accounting firm
presumably this was Twitter's accounting
firm
to to slap him down to basically do
something bad to Twitter and if they
didn't do something bad to Twitter
they'd pay for it later the FTC putting
the hammer on the Ernst and Young
now I don't know how much of that is
right that feels like a a Twitter story
meaning like we're not hearing the whole
story
but it's pretty messed up if it's true
I'll just say
big if true
I suspect there's more to this story so
don't buy it completely
all right uh uh Joel Pollock was writing
about
there's a thing coming up in the
election that you probably need to pay
more attention to in terms of prediction
and that's the New Hampshire primary for
the Democrats now Joe Biden is going to
skip New Hampshire and what's the other
State Iowa
he's going to do South Carolina because
that's a big diverse State yeah so he's
going to skip New Hampshire and Iowa
partly because he doesn't know he would
do well
you don't want to go into New Hampshire
and lose to somebody on the first one
that's a bad look so he's just going to
skip it
however
RFK Jr will not be skipping it and he's
pretty popular in that part of the
country
so if RFK Jr pulls off a whim in the
first primary at the same time Biden's
you know cognitive decline is happening
in the same time that the big donors are
saying maybe not
could that be enough
to swing the momentum toward RFK Journey
and
I guess the only real answer is
it could
and even though Joe Biden is skipping
New Hampshire because it doesn't
represent the country and it's small
that's not how people are going to see
it
people are very trained that New
Hampshire matters
even if it doesn't you know or in our
brains it matters it doesn't matter in
the real world you know in terms of its
size it's such a small thing but yeah it
actually could change the psychology of
what's possible and that change could
absolutely create a path for RFK Journey
so I'm not saying it will
I'd bet against it if I had to put a bet
on it I bet against it but it's
definitely within the realm of
I don't know 30 possible
a kind of a serious consideration
all right
um I had a
observation about the Andrew Tate lover
boy charges in Romania
so according to Tate and of course
he's not the final Authority in this
because he's you know he's selling a
version that he wants you to hear but he
says that the uh the the only charges
that got
um put on him by Romania is that he was
making girls fall in love with him and
it's called the lover boy approach which
is by the way not even illegal in a lot
of places
so but in Romania it is and the idea is
that you seduce these women and then
when they think they're really just your
girlfriend you use your your persuasion
to turn them into sex workers
and then you take some of their body
so that's the Loverboy technique now
what Tate did
and I think he admits it is that his he
had girlfriends fall in love with him
and he did in fact
create an opportunity for them to do
webcam you know sex sex talk stuff
now he says he didn't take any of their
money
I don't know one way or the other that's
just what he says the prosecutors say
something else but I don't think the
girls are complaining
so my understanding is there are no
Witnesses against them and that there is
no victim who is willing to to Define
themselves as a victim
so after all of this
there's not one person
in the real world who says he victimized
them none
there's actually none
now now that's his that's his claim
right
for all I know there could be hundreds
of them but his his claim is that there
there's nobody but in the Romanian
system the Romanian Department of
Justice they can declare that the woman
is a victim even if she says what are
you talking about
I'm no victim
I I didn't get brainwashed I was offered
this opportunity by somebody I care
about a lot
and then I decided to take the
opportunity because it looked good
that's what they say now you might ask
are they under duress
are they being maybe bribed
are they afraid are they afraid or are
they just in love maybe they're just in
love with them so they don't want to say
anything bad
but it is a weird situation that there's
no there's no uh
victim and in term at least the victim
who admits being a victim so that's kind
of a sketchy situation wouldn't you say
but here's the thing I realized
the charges are basically that he's the
one of the most persuasive people in the
world
because he's not being charged with
convincing one woman
to be his girlfriend and then
turning her into a webcam girl no he's
accused of doing it 75 times
am I do do a fact check on that but I I
think at one point there was worthy he
had 75 webcam girls that he had
you know got there under at least some
number of them under similar
circumstance
now do you believe
that he is so persuasive that he could
get dozens
of girls to not only fall in love with
him presumably had physical encounters
with him and then also he convinced them
to become sex operators in Romania
because he's that he's that persuasive
yeah he could do that
yep you want a definitive answer yes yes
he could do that he does have the talent
he has the entire persuasion stack from
the the physicality which is you know a
good half of what he does right women
like
tall muscular guys who talk in a
confident way and have a lot of money
and you know have a lot of swagger so
yes he is persuasive enough that he may
have convinced 75 people to do something
they wouldn't have done otherwise
but this is where it gets gets
interesting
if he's really that persuasive
there's no way in the world they're
going to beat him in a trial
or even you know even if it's just a
judge
if he's that persuasive he's going to
persuade himself out of prison
yeah oh I well yeah
um
so take you said that he got up to do
tick tocks not webcam stuff
so that that's what he said today
separately
separately he's said that he had webcam
operators so he he said it's not from
news reports but it could be it could be
that none of the women who are part of
the charges were on webcams that's
possible it could be that they were only
doing Tick Tock it's also possible that
they were using Tick Tock as a way to
get customers for a webcam business and
the prosecutors can't find evidence of
the webcam business
yeah maybe they just
don't have access to those records
because if somebody did a bunch of
webcams but nobody recorded it
and and whoever would have records of
that is maybe a company in another
country that doesn't want to give you
access
it's entirely possible that there was
like massive webcaming you know sex
webcaming but it's impossible to prove
because you go to the girls and you say
were you webcaming and they go no I was
just tick-tocking
what do you do
if that's their story because probably
they don't want to be implicated in
anything sketchy either
so they might say no I didn't do any of
that webcaming how can you prove it
can you approve I did some webcaming
maybe they can't it feels like they
could but maybe they can't
anyway so here's the funny part if Tate
is as persuasive as the prosecution says
then he's also persuasive enough to get
out of the charges by literally
persuading himself out of jail
does he have the talent
to actually persuade himself out of jail
you know if if he's being targeted and
or actually guilty and the answer is yes
now I got some pushback on my tweet
because somebody says Scott Scott
trials are about evidence
the evidence will determine whether he's
found guilty
to which I said
I'll get back in your time machine and
go back to 1953 because in the world of
today no it's not about the evidence if
it were about the evidence everybody
would have agreed on OJ
right if it were about the evidence
Biden would be in jail
right it's never about the evidence not
with high profile stuff it's about
persuasion
and so the government of Romania is
trying to enter a persuasion contest
which is what a trial would be a
persuasion contest against allegedly
one of the most persuasive humans
on planet Earth
which actually is
you know I don't know if he's in top
five or top 10 but he's one of the most
persuasive human beings
on the planet
right it's just a fact
and how does he lose a how does he lose
a jury trial
because he also has you know the brains
and the strategy he's a chess player I
mean he's got the whole thing
how does he lose
now there are two possibilities one he
he really is as persuasive as the
Romanians claim if that's true then
he'll persuade himself out of jail
two he's not very persuasive at all
in which case how did he persuade 75
women to move to Romania and do webcams
or tick tocks or whatever
how do you do that if you're not
persuasive
so there's sort of a logical problem
here
if the charges are true he'll go free
if the charges are false he's innocent
and there's only two possibilities it's
true or false and they both get him out
of jail
is that weird
that he has two paths and both of them
are getting out of jail
unless it's rigged which is a very good
possibility unless it's rigged so his
his uh suggestion was that maybe Great
Britain was trying to suppress him
because his message wasn't good for the
Youth of Great Britain I think there
might be something to that
there definitely might be some political
a little pressure on Romania to Tamp him
down a little bit baby seems reasonable
but uh we'll see how that turns out it's
probably the most interesting contest in
the world
because he generally he genuinely is
more persuasive than
any prosecutor is going to be
like I don't know what kind of evidence
they have but if that evidence isn't
just super airtight
with Witnesses with Witnesses who admit
they are victims I just don't see how he
can be convicted he's just too good at
this specifically this
we'll see
that ladies and gentlemen concludes my
amazing live stream the very best thing
that's ever happened to any of you
is there any topic I missed today that I
should have
spoke about
he does not speak Romanian but that
shouldn't shouldn't change the result
because whatever persuasion he possesses
he can he can just run through his
lawyer he basically just tells the
lawyer how to handle things and should
work out fine
you assume a trial
no when I say trial I mean a judge will
decide are you making a distinction
there
my understanding is that in Romania it's
you talk to judges not a jury of your
peer or at least for this case I don't
know if it's different for others
but but I was I still call that a trial
and the rules of persuasion would still
apply
he would have an easier deal well let me
say it this way there isn't the
slightest chance a jury of his peers
would convict him
let me say that flat out
flat out
if the trial and I think it won't be
it'll be a judge or judges but if it
were a jury of his peers there isn't the
slightest chance
there would be a unanimous 12 people
conviction none the literally a zero
chance it couldn't happen because his
powers
are just too big he could persuade
himself to Ikea he could take out a few
a few jurors just easily
uh the Nexium cult leader was very
persuasive but still received a hundred
year sentence
now
good point
that's a good point
but do you think he was as persuasive
I think there's a level of difference
here
because I never even heard of Nexium
until they got in trouble but the entire
planet heard of Tate
so I would say the Nexium guy has skills
but he was still a b-plus
compared to what you're seeing from Tate
you know Tate's at the a plus plus level
of persuasion
yeah by the way I I don't like him
personally I just want to make sure you
know that don't like him personally
personally nothing but I've I've
promised I'm going to call balls and
Strikes as they say
God I hate saying that
calling balls and Strikes let's retire
in that it's such an NPC thing to say
but I told you I'd say when people had
good persuasion when they don't and you
could probably learn
watch his technique and you could
probably learn
all right
um
the Nexium guy was too ugly to be
persuasive well is that
huh
uh who's your favorite puppet um
please discuss the sound of Freedom no
plans to watch it
I recommend you don't watch it either
not because it isn't great and not
because it isn't important
it it's like I'm not going to watch
things that are going to bring me down
I get the topic right if you understand
the topic
I feel like that's enough
all right I'm in the zeitgeist
cool pool vacuums I don't I wish I did
that's the worst suggestion I've ever
heard you make
what would be the counter argument give
me the counter argument what's the
argument for watching it if you if
you're aware of the situation
let's say you read about let's say you
read a review or you read an article
what would be the point of suffering
through two and a half hours of the
worst thing I could imagine what do you
get from that
you need to be talking about it now I'm
out I'm out I'm tapping out I'm not
going to do every topic
and I'm not gonna I'm not going to turn
this live stream into that all right
there are plenty of people working on
that and doing a great job the the fact
that you're begging me to talk about it
tells me you already know about it
you don't need me
right
whatever is happening in that domain
looks like it's happening exactly the
way it should meaning that somebody made
a movie it's very persuasive and
um it's getting tons of attention
you don't need me for this you would
need me if it were getting no attention
and then I'd probably actually have a
different opinion
but at the moment I'm not additive I
would be just one more person to make me
think about bad things
and you have enough people making you
think about bad stuff
so you don't need me
so I'm not minimizing the problem
and I'm not minimizing the movie I'm
saying it's doing fine just the way it
is it doesn't need any extra help
uh
Scott just says it doesn't exist like
they say it is
have I ever said that no so people on
YouTube
um could you please go to Twitter with
the rumors that you're making up about
me
because I don't think enough people are
seeing your comments they're they're
kind of wasted over here on on YouTube
I feel like an idiot like me
I mean you really need to tell me off
sometimes I just need that
sometimes I just need to be put in my
place and I know it I know it so if you
wouldn't mind
the criticisms on YouTube were very well
intended and very effective and I thank
you for them I really think you need a
bigger audience for them
so I've got a I've got a million uh
followers close to the million on
Twitter whereas my live streams are you
know just in the thousands
so if you want that criticism to get the
credit that you deserve for really
insightful made-up thoughts
with no connection to reality I think
you deserve a bigger venue you need a
bigger platform take that to Twitter
it's at Scott Adams says and then under
any tweet it doesn't even have to be on
topic this is the beauty I could be
tweeting about a new building material
for your house you can slip in those
comments and tell them that I'm just not
as angry as pedophiles as I should be
and that probably means something
doesn't it so slip that in there make
sure that it's all caps if you could do
me a favor
all caps
because then I can find it easier I'll
be looking through my comments looking
for the good ones and I'll be like a bad
one bad one better oh that's a that's a
good criticism there that is nicely done
crisply put together well designed good
for you good for you so all caps will
draw me to a bigger platform
I would like to see you get the credit
that you deserve
can we all agree on this I believe my
critics have not been getting the
platform and the credit that they
deserve can we all finally agree that I
should be criticized far more
aggressively
please
do it right
all right
thanks for that YouTube
I'll talk to you tomorrow you're awesome
well most of you are
bye for now
