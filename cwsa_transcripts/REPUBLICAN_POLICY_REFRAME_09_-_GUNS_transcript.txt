here's what the
here's what the
uh republicans do wrong on guns
they let they let biden define it as it
would be
citizens against the military of the
united states
that will never happen
no nobody's talking about citizens with
their little uh
little little guns taking on the
military
but they let they let biden define that
as the problem
do you know what would be more like
did i tell you that uh five
russian-backed
officials have were murdered just
yesterday
in russian-dominated territories in
ukraine
that's what happens
what happens is every time the
let's say illegitimate government
who is trying to take your guns or
whatever they were trying to do that as
soon as they install a puppet there's
not enough security in the world
to protect that puppet
like ukraine
so in ukraine
every russian puppet will probably be
murdered
probably every one of them eventually
you know it just takes a while
but it looks like they're just going to
kill every one of them because they can
there would be nothing that could stop
them from getting every one of them
because you're not going to let every
official have
an underground bunker
right
so and you don't have to get the top
people like you don't have to use your
your handgun to get to
the president of the united states who's
become a dictator and taking over the
country
you only have to get to the
like the mayor
like the people who are just sort of
keeping the lights on just get to them
kill them all
which is exactly what would happen
if the u.s tried to turn into some kind
of a dictatorship
and install you know like puppets
everywhere
we would just kill all the puppets
because it would be easy everybody has a
gun
