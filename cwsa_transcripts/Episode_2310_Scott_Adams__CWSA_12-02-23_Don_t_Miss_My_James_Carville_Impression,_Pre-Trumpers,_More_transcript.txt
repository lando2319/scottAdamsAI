[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams the best thing you've ever
experienced and if you want to take it
up to levels that nobody will ever
achieve again well all you need for that
is a cuper muger glass a tankered sheler
Stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure it's the
dopamine h of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called a
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
savor it
go all the way to my
bones I feel this coffee in my
toenails feels pretty
good pretty pretty
good
well I've got a show for you and it's
got a theme the theme will be revealed
as we go along cuz they're better with a
theme but first top of the news V
ramaswami has uh coined a new term that
I'm going to
borrow which is another word for
stealing I'm stealing it I'll call it
borrowing and V posted on next today the
left says are race and sexuality govern
who you are and what you can achieve if
you question them they call you a racist
this is psychological
slavery
oo hello yes yes it is psychological
slavery you're not allowed to say what
you think or you will be destroyed in
Civilization it's
psychological
slavery that Culture of Fear has
completely replaced our culture of free
speech and V says I am running for
president to fix
it
damn damn that is so
good
anyway um I saw a uh graph showing that
45 million immigrants counting legal and
illegal immigrants make up our country
of I don't know what are we up to 380
million or something what's the current
population of the United States 380 350
it's only a
350 I thought it was more than 350 now
is that the current number 350 oh okay
people say 350 all right so 45 million
of the 350 million are immigrants legal
and
illegal and you know I think the point
of the post I saw was that there are too
many
immigrants now certainly it's a huge
burden on the system to have too many
immigrants too quickly so it's a it's a
flow rate problem it's not a question of
immigrants yes or no it's just a flow
rate issue
however um I think that the context has
to be that and by the way this is
showing that there's been a huge
increase since 1980 in
Immigration now what would have happened
if there had not
been because this is what I like to
teach you you know with my background in
economics that if you don't say what
would it have been if it hadn't happened
like would it have necessarily been
better and would it be just different
now it could have been um it it could
have been better or worse I don't know
but here's the thing that we don't know
would the population of the United
States have
declined without
immigration would we have a declining
population or alternately a population
is growing but not fast enough enough CU
one of the things that Elon Musk is sort
of brilliant about explaining to us is
that uh population overpopulation is far
less of a problem than
underpopulation because you can't pay
for your old people probably wouldn't be
a problem if old people weren't living
so long but you're going to have a real
big population of non-workers to workers
under the current situation so so
success is a pyramid
scheme I hate to say it but the only way
you can succeed in the long run is a
pyramid scheme where you're bringing
you're you're having lots of new babies
that have to work hard to pay for the
older people as soon as you're not
bringing in new people at the bottom of
the pyramid the the top falls apart too
eventually so uh let me agree with you
who are all screaming in your brains but
Scott but Scott it wouldn't would have
been far better to control immigration
so we vetted the right immigrants and to
uh financially
incentivize big
families would you agree with that would
have been better to control
immigration get plenty of it but control
it so you get the right mix and and then
also you know financially incentivize
the population that's good I agree with
that and can we also agree that we
should use our time machines to go back
in time and fix
it who's with
me time
travel
anybody yeah my point is you don't get
to compare it to the thing you didn't do
and that you wouldn't have done that's
not the right comparison the only the
only thing I'm saying is that the past
is already over if you're comparing it
to the
Future then you want to bring in this
let's do good vetting you know let's
maybe incentivize uh families of people
who are already
here in the future that's the way to go
no doubt about it but you really can't
change the past I'm just saying would we
be better off if we didn't have 45
million immigrants who came in without
as much vetting as we could have had and
the answer is I don't know I don't know
you think if you think you know the
answer to that question
I'm pretty sure you don't in the short
run I would agree it's
bad in the short run it's you a burden
on the
system but how many of those people are
homeless you know prior to the the most
recent surge which is over the top for
20 or 30 years how many immigrants
became
homeless about
zero and and I'm going to say something
super super uh racist but it's okay
because it's about white people so I'm
allowed to do that have you ever tried
to get a white guy to mow you
la ever try to get a white guy to do
some work on your
house it depend it depends where you
live right it depends entirely where you
live but I got to tell you there's
there's a huge part of the economy that
wouldn't work at all without immigration
because you just can't get people to do
that work for whatever reason it doesn't
pay enough or whatever I don't know what
the reason is but you're not going to
get white people to do that work they
just won't they'll just sit around and
die instead I don't know why yeah good
luck with the
teenagers and the comment somebody well
you could get the teenagers to do that
work good luck good luck all right try
your way now I don't know so so let me
be very careful about this I don't know
that we're better off
but I think more likely yes than
no now even with even with all the
negatives of which there are tremendous
negatives I think we probably n down
okay in the long run in the short run
maybe not you know last last four years
probably more bad than good but you have
to look at the longer run most of them
will have kids who went to American
schools and really bought into the
American dream you know the the
immigrants are pretty much more American
than the ones who are here let me say
that
again a lot of our immigrants not all of
them and that's a problem but a lot of
the immigrants especially the ones
coming from South of the Border are more
American than the
Americans they're more American than the
Americans they want to work hard they're
they they worship their God they're huge
on family and they want America to do
well cuz it's their new country
that's as American as you can get and by
the way they're not woke they're not
woke at all they're not even a little
woke not even slightly
woke you you telling me they're bringing
the average
down I don't think so have you seen the
people were
here yeah all right well I just want to
put I just want to put some doubt in
your
mind about the the mix and the quality
of immigrants and what that looks like
in the long run might be more good than
you
think well the Disney bashing is at an
all-time high uh we we have some stats
that say the the child grooming content
on the xplatform has reduced by
83% recently wow child grooming on X is
down to 83% and that's because Disney
pulled their
ads okay that's the Babylon bees joke B
Bon B is just killing
it yeah the Babylon B is like has you
know gone to like National Treasure
level to the point where you feel sorry
if somebody hasn't isn't watching it
every day that's some good
stuff that is some really good stuff so
the mockery guns are firing non-stop
now so uh yesterday I I posted this
because I like to pile on I said does
Bob Iger no Disney no longer makes
relevant products and their theme parks
have all the fun of Gaza during
wartime so that's what I said and uh I
looked at the comments today one of the
comments on that was from Elon Musk and
he says Disney has a major content
problem almost their entire upcoming
slate is
unwatchable they are the world's biggest
example of go woke go broke
LOL
LOL
now is it my imagination or is it now
obvious that there's more than one Elon
Musk there's more than one
right CU how do you explain that there
are 8 billion people in the world and I
can wake up and see the the richest
person in the world commenting on my
post that's not
possible I mean just consider the odds
of that that's not actually possible
he's running you know the major
companies he's on every podcast you know
he's commenting to
people I think AI has already cloned him
I I think there are at least five to
seven Elon
musks possibly
robots possibly no I don't know I'm just
making that up but I honestly don't know
how he does all the things he does it
just seems like there's way too many
things happening in the world where he's
the most important player in that thing
I mean I get that he's the most
important player in
space I get that I get that he's the
most important player in social media
okay I get that but why is like he's
also he's also the main person like
posting on X how is it possible to do
all those things yeah EVS
Etc well there's some stats that show
that Tik Tok and in stagram or uh like
an order of magnitude worse than x in
terms of anti-Semitic comment uh
but
um why is nothing happening with
that is it obvious to
everybody that anti-Semitism on the
xplatform had nothing to do with the why
the advertisers pulled out it's really
obvious that it's just political right
every everybody can see that now I get
that businesses have to respond to their
customers and it's just one less thing
they think they have to worry about but
do you think that any of these companies
are going to do better because they
pissed off 45% of the country or or
whatever is pro Elon Musk I guess or Pro
X or Pro free speech however we want to
put it but I'd like to again read the
names of these
companies because these companies are
just
 on this topic anyway I mean I have
no respect for these companies these are
major respected PR they were respected
but th this decision is so
despicable and so counterproductive I
just want to read their names again so
you can hear who's the right
Apple computer Disney Washington Post
Paramount NBC Marvel IBM Sony Pictures
CBS the co Bear show Comcast uh
Lionsgate Warner Brothers and now
Walmart I guess the president of Walmart
was a college buddy of uh Hunter
Biden yeah everything's about who knows
who you know if you don't know that part
of a story you usually don't know the
story that's the real part is who knows
who but yeah these companies got some
explaining to
do um I saw a post today that says that
Apple
iPhone has a you've been stopped by the
police app is that
real have you heard of that that you can
you can tell your phone you can talk to
the SI app and tell it you're being
stopped by the police just verbally and
apparently it turns the screen off but
it starts filming and recording so you
can have a recording of it uh the screen
is off so it doesn't look like the phone
is doing something but the the front
camera is working and it records it and
it also sends a message to whoever you
designate you know to tell them that
you've been stopped and you know just to
monitor the situation is that
real I I've only seen one reference to
it but is that real some I'm seeing a
yes that's pretty
cool I would like to remind you that
when black lives matter was first you
know protesting and George Floyd was in
the news and they were looking for
solutions for all the alleged police
problems with uh black pedestrians or
black innocent people or some of them
being arrested for real reasons but
still
um wouldn't it have been nice if the
tech company said hey we could we could
do something about that we're working on
a product but I don't think at any point
black lives matter was
serious I think they were very invested
in keeping the problem the problem
because that's how you raise funds for
the people who run the organization you
you can't solve the problem
that would be very
economically uh unwise
unwise all right uh number of people on
the right are noticing that John
fedman uh is making sense and doing
things that you would want an elected
official to
do what here's what John fedman said
about a politician in his own party
about a prominent Democrat he said quote
uh we have a colleague in the Senate
that's actually done much more Sinister
kinds of things and the context was the
Santos um expulsion and he said he needs
to go if you're going to expel Santos
how can you allow Menendez remember
Menendez is in his own party how can you
allow amendes to remain in the Senate
Menendez is really a senator for Egypt
not New
Jersey
what
what who who exactly predicted that John
fedman would do something that is
unambiguously positive for the United
States while being negative for his own
party didn't see it coming you know what
I can see his appeal
now I never saw it before but I I can
see why people like them right now that
doesn't mean I like everything he does
not going to support him for president
Etc but you got to call out you got to
call out good behavior you want to see
it so I'm going to go against a lot of
uh a lot of Republicans on
this I
actually am kind of happy that there
were enough Republicans to um you know
treat Santos as an outsider basically to
vote against them and I like the fact
that fedman is willing to vote against a
prominent member of his team those are
good
Signs Now I know some people are saying
hey you know the the Republicans are
acting like losers I think sticks and
Hammer made this point you're not
playing to win if you're going to take
out your own person for something that
wasn't even a crime I mean at least he
hasn't been convicted of a crime so it
seems like the Republicans were being
too hard on their own side and not hard
enough on the opponents I get that I get
that but you know
they were also acting under a
principle and they they were trying to
do something that they thought maybe was
good for the party in the long run maybe
it's good for the country in the long
run I'm not going to complain about that
I'm not going to complain about
that yeah so
um yeah I'm not going to compare the two
and say which was worse I'm just going
to say that both
parties you know through fedman on one
side and the Republicans and the other
have shown a willingness to police their
own side that's not
terrible that's not
terrible yeah it could be a lot better
you know again you you'd like them to
handle Menendez as much as the
Republicans handled Santos I get that
those are good points but but trend-wise
directionally to have two prominent
instances of people looking at their own
team yeah
yes on that yeah no I get I get the
counterargument I I have full respect
for the counter argument that you play
to win I get that but I don't hate the
fact that people are trying to do what's
right as well I don't hate it all right
um I saw Robbie Starbuck post that uh
there's some Christian tennessy trucking
company that got fined $700,000 by the
Biden Administration for trying to to
make sure they don't hire illegal
workers so they were requiring people to
show that they were legally citizens of
the United States and they're being
fined do I even need to add any
commentary to that or can we all just
say what what is that really happening
yeah
absurd Jumping the Shark going too far
you know it it it's one thing to open
the borders too far it's another thing
to say that an American here's my
problem with it here's my problem I do
you know I'm I'm uh I'm Kinder on the
Immigrant issue than many of my audience
so that's that's
stipulated but can somebody give me a
fact check on the following question my
understanding is that if you're an
employer and you hire illegals and you
know it and you know it that you're in
big trouble with the law am I wrong
about that it used to be the case if you
knowingly hired illegals that your whole
company would be shut
down now the the way the way people got
got around that in the past do you know
how they got around it in the
past it was not illegal to be fooled by
the
immigrants so as long as they had
documentation
which they often do you know forgeries
and stuff as long as they had some kind
of fake ID that you couldn't tell
because you're just an employer you're
not a you're not a forgery expert so as
long as they had something then then the
employer was
safe uh because they could say well we
checked you know they lied to us what
are you going to do so that was okay and
that worked even though it was kind of
stupid but it
worked now the situation looks to me
like if they Tred to if they try to
check using the minimal amount of
intrusive investigation which is do you
have
ID you know do you have a whatever they
ask for must have been demonstrating
they were citizens the most basic you
know the most basic thing you would ask
is is it legal for me to hire you
imagine this that the employer can't ask
if they would be breaking the law if I
hire you would I be breaking the law
can't ask
that crazy crazy stuff now there might
be more to the story than we know that's
always the case but
um certainly raises an
eyebrow somebody on xplatform posted a
survey now this was like 20 years ago
but it's relevant today and the survey
showed that the college
majors um that were you know you know
the the really hard ones like chemistry
and engineering and physics and all that
were like 90% men and that the uh
occupations at the lower level of the IQ
Spectrum this was the point made by the
poster not me um that the lower IQ jobs
like social worker and
teacher um and therapist were done
mostly by
women
now uh the the male female part of that
didn't interest me too much that to me
that wasn't the main point but I doubted
that this this chart could be true in
general because it was arguing that the
that the highest IQ people were going
into jobs in
technology and that the low IQ people
were going to jobs like teachers and
therapists and stuff now that can't be
true because this is 20 years ago if
this had been true 20 years ago and
stayed true what would we see I mean
what we'd see is I mean if that were
true so obviously it's not true but if
that were true you'd see these amazing
advances in technology you know you'd be
seeing stuff like I don't know Rockets
getting ready to go to Mars
like that you'd be seeing uh what else
like artificial intelligence You' be
seeing like artificial intelligence Stu
like that so if all the Geniuses were
going to technology you'd be seeing
rockets and Ai and like that um and
if it were true that the unintelligent
people were going to teaching and
therapy I me what kind of a world would
that be now I mean obviously that didn't
happen because you'd be seeing that the
school system was totally and if
you went to a therapist you're basically
a masochist because they don't know
anything that you don't know and we we
know that's not the case we know our
school system is humming along perfectly
and if you go to therapy you'll probably
be cured by the third
session and Technology hasn't done
anything interesting for years so U I'm
going to debunk that that the smart
people go into those professions because
we'd see signs of it by now I feel like
we'd see something like that don't
you all
right um do you know Nate silver Nate
silver
uh he worked for the New York Times
before is that correct give me a fact
check before he left he was in the New
York Times that he went to 538 he sold
that now he's sort of
independent um I always thought that
Nate was you know sort of a Centrist but
maybe leaning a little bit
left that's why I always thought but you
know he he tried to I I always thought
he was a a uh Fair Observer of the world
but here's something he's saying today
on no well November 30th he posted this
if I were hiring right now I'd prefer
High achieving State School students
undifferentiated uh uh better than
undifferentiated IV League students not
a remotely close
call so uh undifferentiated
undifferentiated ivy league
students I don't know what he means
exactly by undiff differentiated but he
would achieve he would prefer a high
achieving state school over the Ivy
Leagues CU what we're
seeing really kind of suggests their
brains are being destroyed by The Ivy
leag um
experience so I
agree now this is the beginning of my
theme for
today so the theme is going to be
this I I I'm introducing a new
term you know there are people who are
anti-trump and you know there are people
who are prot Trump you certainly know
that and not too many people are
undecided but there seems to be a new
category that I'm going to call
pre-trump
pre-trump they're not pro Trump oh oh no
no no no no no no no no no don't get me
wrong they're not pro
Trump but they're not
anti-trump they are Trump Cur
ious they are open they're open they're
open to
it I would put uh
um I'm going to
put Nate in that
category
um yeah I think Nate
silver I don't want to put any words in
his mouth so let me be clear he's not
pro
Trump there's nothing about him to
suggest Pro Trump but I don't see a lot
of suggestion that he's Pro Biden if you
know what I mean so I'm not suggesting
he might go full
Trump but he feels pretty close to
pre-trump a little bit of pre-trump
going on you know what I mean let's
watch for that all right um DeSantis is
uh you on his uh
debate with Nome he avoided the question
of whether he would support a national
ban on abortion do you think that was
the right Play Because Nome banged him
on it pretty good do you think DeSantis
should avoid answering the question
about a federal ban on
abortion I say
yes that's the better way to play it
yeah and I think I don't know what Trump
will do but I think he's smart enough to
say let's leave it to the
states and because leave it to the
states is the most consistent thing to
say so that explains it explains
everything really and it's hard to argue
with the state has the closest
approximation of what the citizens of
the state want it's the place where you
capture their preferences better than at
a federal level where everybody gets
averaged together so it's really hard to
argue that you should use a federal
average when the states are very
different in their preferences it's not
really a good
argument you know even even if you
prefer like a using a hammer to make it
illegal it's not it's not the best
argument so I think the best argument is
leave it to the
states well Tucker Carlson was on the
all-in-one pod and man can that guy make
news do you remember when Tucker was not
so Pro
Trump you remember that right there have
been times that Tucker has been
absolutely insulting to
Trump but what is he
now he's turned now he he went all the
way from pre-trump to absolutely Trump
so he's a he's a turnaround case another
turnaround but uh he was talking about
Gavin Nome and this is interesting it's
interesting because uh I think Tucker is
a an honest broker especially about his
personal experience I think when Tucker
is talking about his personal experience
as opposed to an opinion I think it's
always true I don't think he has I don't
believe he has a lying bone in his body
I've disagreed with him a number of
times and I thought he's gotten some
things wrong factually just like
everybody in that business right that
that's really saying nothing but I've
never I've never p picked up a whiff not
a whiff that Tucker ever lied to
you about an actual direct experience
like I've never seen that I don't think
that's happening so when he says what
his direct personal experience is I
always I always give that more
credibility than most things in the news
and he talks about Gavin Nome he says
one thing I know for a fact about Gavin
Nome is really an opinion it's not a
fact but he says I know for a fact about
Gavin Nome is he has the Capac
to beat a lie detector
test which is really good uh persuasion
because you can see the lie detector
test can't you you you can see the
device and you see them hooked up to it
like that's way better communication
than just saying he's not honest you can
actually see the device that's visual
persuasion he says gav's Palms don't
sweat his respiration doesn't increase
his body temperature doesn't change
Chang nothing changes in Gavin new when
he lies to your
face and I don't know I I watched him in
in the uh debate for like one minute and
I told you this the moment he he looked
at the camera and said with a straight
face several times that more people were
moving from Florida to California than
the other way I said to myself my God he
could lie about anything right to your
face I guess he can um but then tuer
said that it's well understood that
California is the most fixed state for
politics meaning that if the people in
charge want Nome to be Governor he'll be
Governor you know Etc so I don't know I
I don't know what the evidence of that
would be but I do think that Tucker is
closer to that world than I am so if he
says California is the most corrupt
state politically I'm inclined to
believe
him you know there might be some
competition for it but I'm kind of
inclined to believe it might be the most
rigged State and you know what I'd never
thought about it that way before I can't
I got to honestly say I just thought
that California had less of
Democrats to me that I thought that was
old story but it might be completely
non-democratic according to Tucker and I
can't dispute it but I'd have to see
more evidence before I buy into that
point of
view all right
um and Tucker is talking about how even
if when he was on Fox uh he was very
aware that if you talk against the
interest of your corporate sponsors
eventually bad things will happen to
you right so he he would say things
about the
vaccinations that the sponsors of the
network probably didn't like so he knew
it was a taking time bomb and he was not
surprised at all that eventually he got
kicked off and took it completely
professionally because it's just part of
the deal which I I do respect about
Tucker that he took it as a business
decision it's just
professional you don't have to hate the
people involved right I I get that and I
respect that um but that does make you
wonder if somebody's taking uh
advertisement from Big Pharma or from uh
Tik
Tock can they speak as
honestly as they might because they
don't need to be instructed to not speak
out against their sponsors nobody needs
to be told to do
that when when I spend every day on live
stream saying the Washington Post was
fake
news did I know that I would eventually
be cancelled by The Washington
Post and you know other papers too of
course I did I knew it was the risk so
like Tucker I had the same reaction to
it what oh wow kind of shocking at first
but I never felt um
mad I didn't feel mad at anybody who
canceled me because I understand the
forces at work it was obvious that I was
playing with
fire it's just what happens and as
Tucker says and I respect him for this
if you get into this line of work don't
act surprised when things that happen
all the time in this line of work happen
to you in this line of work like if
you're not willing to accept that as
part of the deal you know you're in the
wrong line of work anyway different
topic um here's Michael shellenberg are
summing up what we know about what I
call the brainwashing industrial complex
I think think others call it the
censorship industrial complex but
censorship doesn't quite capture it
censorship is more like getting rid of
something that's you know they think is
untrue or they don't want you to say but
brainwashing is that plus making you
believe things that are clearly not true
there's it's way more about brainwashing
than it is about just censoring
censoring is too weak I call it the
brainwashing industrial complex or the
Bick anyway uh shellenberger says we
discovered DHS Department of home
security employees volunteering to use
scups and disinformation tactics against
the American
people is that an
exaggeration does does the research show
that Department of Homeland Security
employees volunteered to use asops and
disinformation tactics against the
American people yes it
does yeah yeah the record clearly shows
it they blamed social media platforms
for Trump's election victory in 2016
true yes it's documented absolutely true
um so they used tactics developed abroad
by the US Military and turned them
against the American people ah gosh that
sounds like hyperbole they didn't really
use I mean they didn't really do this
did they did they really use techniques
and tactics used by the military to to
propagandize other countries and they
used it against the American people yes
that's documented that's a fact
right they use these tactics in order to
change the conversation online and
engage in Mass censorship was which is
why we saw in the Twitter files Facebook
files and of course now part of the
Missouri versus Biden case facts
absolutely proven facts James Baker next
part I'm not going to read because I
think there's a typo in it um what what
we saw was an effort by existing FBI
agents and former FBI agents to spread
disinformation about the hunter Biden
laptop and say outright to the the
American people that it was Russian act
and leak operation and of course Biden
repeated this in the
debates all true all true now here's
your uh test find any Democrat in the
United States who is aware of these
facts any find any Democrat any Democrat
in the United States who will say yes
these are
facts
none partly because it's complicated and
partly because there's enough uh you
know bold-faced lying that they'll just
say it didn't happen well this happened
no it
didn't well we have it documented no you
don't well here's the document I don't
see it here it is here it is yeah no I
don't see anything sounds like you're
lying again what are you gaslighting me
here it is here it is look look is right
here I don't see
anything and the Democrats that works
it
works all right
um do you remember when uh Trump got
interrupted by that NBC hack uh Christen
Welker and Trump said that the January 6
committee destroyed all the evidence of
their
investigation and she pushed back oh
there's no evidence that no that's not a
fact but now it's
confirmed they destroyed it all who
destroys all of their data from
something that's like the most important
thing that happened that year
nobody nobody destroys it
accidentally and Nobody Does it
intentionally unless they're trying to
hide a
crime they're obviously trying to hide a
crime I'm going to add this to my
prediction that Trump would start
looking better every
day from 2020
on that his reputation would rise and
you can't stop it because and and here's
the reason why I think the brainwashing
bubble has too many cracks in it it's
starting to dissolve and you're creating
a bunch of pre- trumpers who are saying
I'm I'm not sure this whole story we've
been told the whole time is exactly true
I feel like maybe people lied to me and
maybe I was better off under
Trump right so you can see that all the
forces that would cause the pre-
trumpers so the biggest force is that
every day that goes by something Trump
said that he was you know attacked for
turns out to be true and hoaxes that he
was blamed for are being debunked over
time so his
reputation is is just Rising every day
just one little one tick at a time you
know one news story one more news story
polls go up one more news story here's
some some
more
um well first of all let me talk about
Bill Mah uh he had some interesting
things to say he had a good joke at the
be at his monologue he was talking about
the uh new sanus debate and he said at
the end of the day nobody's mind was
changed about anything what's going to
make the difference Gavin Nome is 6'3
with a smile like a movie star and
disantis is 510 in heels with the forced
smile of a serial
killer okay that was
perfect that was um that was perfect
yeah yeah that was exactly he summed it
up that's it that's that was the whole
thing all right so that was good
um so Bill M was talking about uh he was
talking with James Carville and Dave
Rubin was there uh on the panel and
Trump was talking about how uh I'm sorry
Bill Mar was talking about how Trump
Trump uh wants to teach the school kids
to love America because they're not
being taught that they might be taught
the
opposite now this is a concrete example
of somebody who is very anti-trump who's
now saying
something leading Pro Trump right he's
definitely not saying he's going to vote
for Trump so he's not a pro
Trumper but is he an
anti-trumper I don't think he is I mean
there are things he hates
and he may hate him
personally but he's sort of a pre-
Trumper meaning that it's not out of the
question that he would vote for him he's
not saying he will and I'm not
predicting it but it's within the realm
of possibility he's a pre-
Trumper but it goes It goes
further
um at one point James Carville in
responding to this topic throws in
something that has nothing to do with
the topic is just bad for Trump so in
other words even Carville couldn't find
anything wrong with teaching school
children to like
America because that was the
topic what are you going to say about
that except that well okay Trump's right
about that but if you're Carville you
can't say Trump's right about anything
you can't give him you know even one
little sliver of positive so Carville
instead he starts melting down and it
looks like maybe he's lost his step I
don't know how old he is but he's not
the old James Carville let's say to say
let's just say the Biden isation of
James carel has begun if you know what I
mean the Biden isation yes
so Carville brings up the fine people
Hox in
Charlottesville and he wants to sell
that as a fact before he makes his next
point so here's what he does he says as
a question he goes uh were there good
people on both sides in Charlottesville
now you have to see it to know that he
brings this up completely out of context
he just needed something anti-trump to
throw in so he looks at the audience he
looks at Dave ruin he looks at uh Bill
Maher and he says were there good people
on both sides in Charlottesville did I
hear that here's the best part he goes
did I hear that or did I make that
up Dave
ruin sitting right next to him turns to
him and a foot away from his face says
in dead
pan he didn't say that a few seconds
later he said I'm not talking about the
neo-nazis and white
supremacists right to his face a foot
away from him in front of the world now
what did um what did Carville say did
carille defend himself and say oh yes he
definitely said
that uh I want to play for you what he
did say before I give you my impression
of James Carville answering this
question all right so there's a little
Preamble I see when I see kids
demonstrating these Progressive
progressives demonstrating for Hamas the
most illiberal people in the world that
oh good we're going to give America it's
come up it's America this is
they kind of have been indoctrinated
this way and Chuck Schumer made a be
this week he said Andie said is a five
alarm fire that must be extinguished
this is the highest ranking Jewish
politician we've ever had in this
country wait for it he talked about when
Jewish people hear chance like from The
River To The Sea you understand that
means wipe us out by any means
necessary um vulnerability ities in the
party James the Democrats have a big
split generationally on this issue wait
the kids seem to be with the
Palestinians and the older generation
seems to be with Israel well the kids
are with tiktock they're with whatever
Tik Tok told them to be for basically
perfect well that is where a lot would
good people on both sides of
charville I don't know did I hear that
or did I make that up that Trump said
they're good people on both sides he he
didn't say that did not he he well he
said it but a sentence later he said I'm
not talking about the white supremacists
and and the eazi
yeah he like on it was badly phrased I
think we can agree on that it was
inelegant yeah it was
inelegant now the first thing you need
to understand is that Bill Maher backed
up Dave
Rubin when when Bill Mah says it was
inelegant he's saying directly he didn't
say it
he's saying he didn't say
it so here's
Carville who's got two he's got Dave
Rubin who was you know born a Democrat
but you know now I would call him more
independent and he's got Bill Maher very
associated with left and they're both
debunking him to his
face in front of the
world so did you hear what carville's
response was when Dave fact checked him
right in front of him
I'd like to give my impression of James
Carville getting fact jacked by Dave
Ruben first Dave
reuin well he didn't say that uh because
a few few seconds later he clarified
that he was not talking about the
neo-nazis and the white supremacists and
now James Carval fact checked on the
biggest hoax in American
politics
would you like to see it
again yes you would James Carville
explaining his side of his opinion of
what Trump said in charlotesville
maybe the finest day in American
politics how long have I been waiting
for this
how long have I
been trying to get rid of this stupid
hoax now it this won't get rid of the
hoax because the people who are sold on
it will still be sold on it but here's
what we do
know James Carville knows it was a
hoax we do know
that now you tell me do you think
anybody in the audience caught this you
know do do you think that the at least
the Democrats were watching the show do
you think that they caught
that I don't know but maybe a few maybe
a few people just
became pre-trump
all right
um what do you think will happen if uh
Biden dropped out and it's Nome
what how do you think the matchup would
be between Nome and
Trump what just give me your first
impression how how would it be as a
matchup now remember new would have the
full power of the Democrat
machine which is
awesome what do you
think here's what it feels
like uh imagine if you will the biggest
complaints about Trump what are the
biggest complaints about Trump
let's see he's a lying
womanizer older white
guy you see where I'm going with this
they're both a six foot three older
white
guys who have womanizing problems and
are accused of being serial
Liars the only thing Biden going for him
is that people didn't yet know he was
the bigger
liar that's all they had the only thing
they had was they didn't know that and
and you know of course of course I'm
being superficial because that's how
voting works on a superficial what do
you feel about it do you think Nome can
get
women uh well he can get women that's
the problem but can he get him to vote
for him once once the Republican machine
turns him into the uh Harvey wein the
Harvey Weinstein of
politics you you don't think the
Republicans are going to turn Nome into
Harvey Weinstein he's going to be the
Met of all meters by the time they're
done with him and and if they try that
with Trump people are going to shrug it
off it's like okay we already did this
we already told you we don't care we
we're way past
that I I feel like in some ways um I
feel like Nome is the worst match
against Trump but he does have
presumably the Democrat machine behind
him which I think is part of their
problem if if Nome were the best match
you could imagine against Trump and he
had the whole Democrat machine behind
him he would already be the
nominee I mean they they were just
forced Biden to bow out I think their
lack of a acceptable nominee is the only
problem is the only reason he's still
there and I think that Nome is the um
unfortunately he got ripe you know ripe
for the presidency at the wrong time
because he got ripe at exactly the time
he'd be running against the the worst
possible choice just the worst
Choice yeah so the problem is that um in
my opinion Nome is the Poor Man's Trump
he's a womanizing lying white guy who
owns a winery and doesn't think the
rules apply to
him let me say it again Nome is a a
divorced womanizing lying white guy who
owns a winery and doesn't think the
rules apply to
him how's he going to win against
Trump he's got all of the bad stuff
without any of the good
stuff that's an exaggeration of
course yeah that French Laundry thing
will haunt him I think that's the least
important thing that ever happened the
French Laundry but politically it'll
haunt him all right let's talk about uh
Gaza so it looks like
um um behind the scenes this is being
reported by an Israeli publication
haret so people have different opinions
about how much you can believe that
publication but they're reporting that
behind the scenes almost every Arab
leader is urging Israel to not stop
uh fighting Hamas until it's destroyed I
believe that I do believe that every um
every leader in the Arab world wants AAS
destroyed becauseas is their enemy as
well as as israels not
cutter not cutter are you
sure I'm not so sure I think things are
complicated over there I think just
because kter is
uh keeping the leadership
protected it doesn't necessarily mean
they want them to
win not necessarily it's complicated
over there all
right uh the ceasefire is over
apparently because part of whatas did
not do is they had agreed to hand over
all the women and children and they did
not do that and no Americans so clearly
they're gaming the system and so Israel
is saying all right we're done with that
uh we're pulling our negotiators out and
it's back to war now some are
speculating that they can't release the
women
because the worst possible reason you
know what the reason is right when the
women are released they're going to have
stories to tell well Deb is a
possibility very much a possibility but
even more than that they're going to
tell stories
of you know I don't even I'm not even
going to say it you know what stories
are going to to tell and Hamas is not
going to be benefited by releasing
people who tell those
stories so and in my mind uh Israel has
the greenest of green
lights because by not releasing the
women they have they have now activated
the
deepest male kill
switch it's the let me say say that
again if you convince all the men in
Israel which I guess they just did that
the remaining hostages are probably past
or current rape
victims you're not just incentivizing
the soldiers to fight because they
already have that you're you're giving
them the kill switch of all kill
switches as in if they ever wanted to
capture you before they don't now
that they're just going to kill them all
and I think
uh what are you going to do I mean Hamas
created this situation if if you
incentivize your enemy to kill you
completely don't be surprised when they
do so uh I would say that this is
hamas's biggest mistake so far is that
when you do this with their
women they're going to kill all of you
they're just going to kill all of you
there's there's no going back from that
and uh I I support Israel 100% on the H
stuff uh Elon Musk said about the
Tesla's version of AI now keep in mind
musk has two versions of AI at least
maybe more working there's the Tesla
version that's being trained at the
moment primarily on video so it watches
a gazillion videos of cars driving and
just from the video it gains
Intelligence on how to self-drive so he
thinks his is way above um he says it's
the best real world
Ai and it might be because of the video
but he also has grock you know in beta
right now so the the Twitter um platform
will have its own Ai and that's separate
that's different from the one Tesla is
using with the video so the grock AI
probably will have access
access I don't know do you think the
grock I AI will have access to whatever
was trained by the
video because they are separate
companies I don't know
maybe if it did then I would immediately
agree with him it's the most powerful AI
but on top of that Gro is going to have
something that chat gbt and the others
do not have which is immediate real-time
access to Twitter now
here's what you get with immediate
real-time access to
Twitter grock's access to the reactions
of Twitter users is very analogous to
your brain's access to your five
senses right your five senses are what's
informing your brain in real
time uh grock will be informed by this
body of human beings reacting to
realtime Stu
you know as it
happens that's a
body more specifically it's a
cyborg where there's a human element the
users on on X and then there's a
non-human element that is you know may
have some
control Elon Musk has
invented the
Borg it's going to be it's going to be a
collective in which there's a
centralized brain and all the
individuals are feeding into it and then
they have access to the intelligence
from the main brain that they help
create access to that's the Borg that's
a collective
cyborg it will be an entity of its own
logically that's so wild now if you're
not a Star Trek fan the Borg is these
aliens that absorb other planets and
turn them into you know half cyborgs and
it's all part of a
collective but um if you take what Tesla
can do with video and add that to what
Gro can do connected to real live users
in real
time nobody else's AI is even in this
class I I think that he's he's he's
probably two weeks away from lapping
chat GPT and Google's barred and
everything else I I think maybe looks
like he's just going to leave them
behind the borging company the borging
company that's pretty funny I wish I'd
thought of it all
right
um so basically El musk is uh creating
the Borg but it's more of a subscription
model
Borg that's the big difference it's like
the Borg
but a subscription
model I don't know why that's funny to
me I I think you'd have to be a Star
Trek fan to know why that's funny it's
the Borg but subscription model all
right trust me that was
funny all right
um and that ladies and
gentlemen is the conclusion of my
excellent excellent commentary not to
mention Impressions that will last
forever so uh I like to think that my
impressions are as good as my
commentary every bit is
good I'm enjoying being a disgraced uh
cartoonist cancelled everywhere so far
it's working out for me
perfectly um I don't know if I gave you
this update or only I did it in the man
cave tell me if this is a
repeat um
but so I got cancelled February of last
year so it's eight or nine months ago
and it's kind of a scary thing if your
entire career just disappears at the
same time
but I'm kind of uh hard to
kill so I want to report to you that 9
months later my um income has
regenerated up to break Break Even cash
flow which means I can pay my employees
and pay my expenses and
um I'm a break even but uh as long as
I'm a break even you can't kill
me I'm
unkillable so if it had been more of a
financial disaster you know maybe I have
to disappear and get a real job but
thanks to all of you uh YouTube and
especially locals uh my beloved locals
people um you made it possible by
becoming the counterforce to my
cancellation you you
collectively
individually formed a protective coat
around me so that I could continue being
the
spear CU for a lot of you I become the
spear right I I'm the one who's poking
people that you can't poke because
you're going to get fired and you know
I'm willing to take the chance so just
know that your plan
worked your plan for me
worked you you wrapped me in a
protective coating which I could feel on
the first day on the first day that
protective cating formed around me and
has protected me till this day thank you
thank you so YouTube thanks and I'll see
you
tomorrow
