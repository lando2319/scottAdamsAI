and if you're not with any loved ones
today well lucky you you're with me
and who loves you more than me
well unfortunately maybe nobody
maybe this maybe it's that kind of day I
don't know could be anything I don't
want to assume that you're all having a
great day I'm not going to assume that
at all
but uh you should assume that I'm loving
you big time today appreciating you a
lot and we're going to take this up a
notch is anybody ready
for the special
Christmas 2022
simultaneous sip anybody any yeah all
right well if you'd like that all you
need is a cup of under a glass of tanker
tell us a sign that canteen chocolate
flask of as a living God fill it with
your favorite uh liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine here the day the
the holiday classic the the thing that
even Santa
wishes he was having right now wishes he
were having right now
grammar accounts so simultaneous episode
dopamine the end of the day it's what
everybody wants it's happening now go
ah yeah do you know what this tastes
like
today
it tastes like a puppy in the package
it's like a puppy in a package that you
opened on Christmas
that is exactly how good it is
all right everybody uh there's some uh
new information from The Washington Post
telling you that uh any amount of
exercise protects you from covet
any amount of exercise 30 minutes a day
would reduce your odds of dying from
covid by 400 or something like that it's
a lot
so it's uh let's say three years since
the beginning of the pandemic
and uh
so far the
scientific community
has rallied around the first thing I
said on the first day of the pandemic
you know you should get some exercise
and make sure you get some vitamin D
go outside and get some exercise
[Laughter]
three years of hard science later you
know you should just do what the
cartoonist told me to do
just listen to the cartoonist you'll be
fine
well it's nice to be right especially on
Christmas on Christmas
does uh anybody have any
Christmas success stories
is anything really good happen to you
today
or you know this week
make sure you put them in the comments
just like you know a little summary like
somebody came home or you got a puppy or
something I want to see just good news
just good news
all right
um I would like to offer
two reframes neither of these are in my
upcoming book
um but they might be I have time to add
them if I like them so I'm going to test
them out on you so yeah you like them
right you're down my test to see if
these two reframes could possibly help
you or somebody you know number one
if you are having some kind of a policy
or factual debate on social media or
anywhere else
and somebody responds with a personal
attack
what should be your response well
in the old days a personal attack was my
God you hate my opinion and you
disrespect me too
that's the old way
here's the new way reframe
if somebody attacks you instead of your
argument
they just agreed you won
that's a confession that your argument
is correct and they got nothing
so when somebody attacks you personally
you should thank them for their
confession
to say thank you I appreciate the
confession
and just walk away
they don't even need to know what you
mean by that
do they you can tell them I appreciate
you confessing that you don't have an
argument
um and have a good day
and Merry Christmas to you
try it out you will be amazed
that when you you reinterpret the
situation as their capitulation although
I like confession
I don't like surrender
because then people get mad
if you say oh because I used to say that
I used to say oh I appreciate your
surrender
but I'd rather confession
because confession actually sounds like
you're doing something Brave right so
you're allowing the other person to be
brave instead of saying well I
appreciate that you you're embarrassed
and humiliated in your loss
not good so I appreciate your confession
you know if you had an argument I would
have expected it but I I'm glad that you
confessed that this is not something you
could argue
but you don't have to add all that just
say I appreciate your confession Merry
Christmas all right that's your first
reframe
try it out and try it out and just see
if it makes you feel better
if it makes you feel better that's the
entire test right there's nothing else
it tries to accomplish
number two I heard this one on a
documentary about Richard Branson
billionaire virgin founder
Richard Benson and apparently this one
came from his mother
because Richard Branson was believe it
or not he was super shy still is he's
shy by nature but he learned to to be
the opposite of shy
in part I believe from his mother's
reframe
so here's how she reframed shyness
I think it's brilliant
I think it's brilliant but you have to
test it for me because I'm not I'm not
shy anymore so I can't test it because I
sort of outgrew my shyness
but here's the reframe for shyness
shyness is selfishness
you are literally thinking about
yourself
and the free frame is think about the
other person for a minute
think about the other people
do they want you sitting in the corner
no
no
do something good for the other people
forget about yourself for a minute
just forget about yourself
just do something for other people don't
you think they want to hear a good story
don't they think they want somebody to
act interested in their stories you know
even more than they want to hear your
story don't you think people want to
have a good interaction
don't you think there's something you
know that might be useful
now you think you could be more
entertaining don't you think you could
be more interested
right
try it out
you know this is what I can't try myself
because I just don't have that
experience anymore
but if there's anybody shy here
just try that out say okay if I were
here for the other people what would I
do differently and watch Watch What
Happens
and the reason I think this might work I
have actually a lot of confidence in the
world work for some people
is if you imagine you're shy but you
have a job that requires interacting
with the public
if it's your job and you know that your
job is to make the public happy their
customers
you don't feel shy do you because you
know what the rules are and you know
that your job is about them right when
you're getting paid nobody pays you to
think about yourself
it doesn't even occur to you that your
personal feelings are even part of the
transaction somebody's giving you money
to make some other person happy the
customer
so it doesn't make you shy
which is a pretty good evidence
that interacting with people is not what
made you shy
right
this is like a real mind Bender because
if you realize that there are all these
situations where you're not shy
and it's because you know that the rules
of this transaction are that you're
focusing on the other person
guaranteed proof that human interaction
is not what was making you shy what was
making you shy was thinking about
yourself
now you haven't tried it yet because you
just heard it
but is that not brilliant
like is that not some of the best mom
advice you ever heard in your life
I just love that so I think I'm going to
put that one in the book would you agree
I think it's strong enough that even
without testing it I'm going to put it
in the book because I'm sure it'll work
for some people
yeah reframes only work for some people
they don't work for every person to make
all right
so if you have people over to your house
or you're interacting with anybody to
say test that one out just say to
yourself oh you know there's some
relatives you you feel a little shy
about maybe extended relatives or maybe
the in-laws that you don't know as well
just say well that in-law looks a little
uncomfortable
I think I'll go make that person a
little more comfortable
or uh that person looks like they don't
know what to do with their hands I'll
ask them if they want a beverage right
somebody looks like they don't know what
to do their hands say hey can I get your
beverage
see if you can solve their problem
dealing with people has ruined you well
I'm sorry
what about the one that won't shut up do
you need a reframe for the person who
can't stop talking
that does anybody have that trouble uh
in your get-togethers yeah me isn't me
[Laughter]
maybe it's me
well
I'll tell you what
your oldest son yeah
um I recommend having a wingman or a
wing woman or Wing binary
you should have somebody who keeps an
eye on you at get-togethers and can pull
you out when they say you got trapped
now you probably know that this is a
bigger problem for me
that it is for normal citizens right
like if I go to an event
people are more interested in talking to
me because I have a you know public
persona so I can get trapped like really
quickly
so I usually have a winged person
a wing person to keep an eye on me every
every five minutes just you know just
look over and see if I'm trapped
and then the winged person you know
Rings my phone or calls me out but
basically if I go to an event without a
wingman I'm in trouble I it's real
trouble for me to be in a public event
yeah
I have a personality I know it's weird
you'll be my wing gal
I appreciate that
all right
um I don't want to talk about the
regular news today everybody okay with
that
I think you are right
I'm gonna do it anyway so I don't want
to talk about like news with people on
both sides like I don't want to talk
about anything where people are
disagreeing right
I just want to tell you something
interesting AI things I know you're not
all into AI but trust me it's not about
the technology
there's something about Humanity that's
going to change a lot and you don't see
it coming so I feel like the
is there something story about somebody
who keeps oh the boy who crawled cried
wolf I feel like the by The Boy Who
Cried Wolf
even though I haven't cried wolf before
I feel like I'm telling people you don't
see what's coming you'd better you
better be ready
something really really really big is
coming and soon and so that that's the
spirit with which I'm talking about AI
it's not a nerdy technical thing it said
it will change civilization and your
most basic Association to other people
and reality and just everything it's all
going to change in maybe three years
so it's the most exciting time to be
alive in my opinion uh so far
there's nothing in human experience that
would be even close to what will happen
in the next three years it won't even be
close
all right so here's some things
that we learned about AI
I was asking us some questions this
morning
um here's the first question I asked to
you this is a philosophical question
can human civilization survive
and AI that was smart enough to tell us
what was true and what we were just
imagining
nope no human civilization could not
survive like raw truth because our our
entire civilization is built on agreed
upon lies
agreed upon Lies We negotiate the lies
with which we build our civilization
it's a negotiated lie and we just agree
this is the LIE we're all going to take
because we don't know what's true
right sometimes you can't agree what's
true sometimes you don't know what's
true but you got to do something
so you end up agreeing on some
hallucinations right
so I don't want to get more detailed
about that
because if I got into what my opinion is
of what you think is true but isn't then
we would just argue about those things
but
just assume that I'm completely wrong
about my personal opinion about what's
really true
that's irrelevant
what is true is that almost certainly
none of us are right
almost certainly at least about
everything right we're all right about
some things
so no matter who you are you're going to
find out that you're totally wrong about
stuff
what will happen if AI gets so good that
it can actually sort out what's true
from what isn't because it's not there
yet it's not even close but it will be
at some point it will be able to discern
what is actually true and what is not
do you know how we will treat the AI if
it reaches at that point
what will we say about it
we will say it is satanic
do you know why
because it doesn't agree with us
what happens when uh what happens when
you have a political belief
and somebody who's a genius
tells you you're wrong what do you say
oh wow I used to think you were smart
but now I realize you're a genius in
every other way but in this thing where
you disagree with me so bad for you I
feel so bad for you because you you know
you're a genius but when it comes to
this one thing wow stupid
right
has anybody ever said wow Elon Musk
believes this he's smarter than I am
I guess I changed my opinion
guess I'm gonna have to go with the
person whose IQ is 50 higher
because he's smarter and he looked into
it more than I did
nobody
nobody will do that do you think we're
going to defer to AI because it's right
no no we're going to say that AI is
broken we're going to say it got this
one wrong
but eventually we'll come around to
blaming it for being satanic
now we're not going to say that the
program itself is satanic
we'll probably say that it was
programmed by sadness
because that's what we do
that that's how we roll so so does
anybody doubt like I'm sure you haven't
thought about it before it's not not
really an active conversation but does
anybody have any doubt that if AI could
actually tell you the truth
you would discount it as being something
the Satanist programmed into it
am I right
I'm not wrong you know I'm right
we will just think it's satanic or the
algorithm is broken or a bunch of
Democrats got into the into the mix and
programmed it wrong
we will no matter how smart a I guess we
won't believe it
we simply won't believe it because it's
too disturbing to believe it
so that's the other way it could go
if we actually believed Ai and it got to
the point where it could tell us what's
true it's not there but if it ever got
there
it would destroy civilization except we
will keep civilization intact by
not believing the AI the same way we do
by not believing the smartest Among Us
yeah if people could be confused if
people could be convinced
by a superior intelligence that they
were wrong we would all be on the same
page we would just search Among Us for
the smartest person we say all right we
found you
just tell us what's true then the
smartest person would say well you know
this has factual basis this doesn't
and then we'd all be on the same page
so we probably don't need to worry about
AI convincing us all of a new truth
because we're not built that way we're
built to reject the truth because it
doesn't work for us
except in some really detailed
scientific ways
all right here are some things that I
asked the AI
is God real
what do you think the AI said
is God real
take a guess
all right most of you say yes
interesting you think it AI would say
that God is real
now that's a very I did not expect this
response it's a mixed response but the
ones who are saying yes
I don't know I don't know exactly what
you're thinking is but we'll get into
that all right so here's what I did say
so I asked chat GPT is God real this
morning and said this is a question that
has been asked and debated by people for
centuries and it is not a question that
can be definitively answered
what do you think of that
is that a question that can be
definitively answered
it doesn't say that about other things
does it
it seems like there are other things
where it says there's no evidence for
that
right
if I asked some question about the virus
that I that I knew not to be true
wouldn't it tell me it was false
or or would it say well people debate
that you know the science indicates is
true but you know science could be wrong
so it's a question of debate people have
been debating it for a long time
no it would just tell you it's true or
false
but when it comes to God
it's programmed not to tell you
now who do you think he came to that
opinion on his own
or do you think to somebody programmed
it to say this or that about God
I don't know I don't know but let's read
the rest of it
uh
um
different people have different beliefs
so it's a whole bunch of blah blah no
one right answer simply believe this
some believe that blah blah blah
uh and it says ultimately the question
of whether or not God is real is a
matter of personal belief and faith
isn't that telling you it's not real
how do you interpret that
if it says the question of whether God
is real is a matter of personal belief
and faith is that not saying directly
that it's not real
that you have a belief that's real but
the only thing is that's real is your
belief
so you you interpret it differently than
I do right so some of you are
interpreting it not that way
um
the question of whether or not God is
real is a matter of personal belief and
faith
but I guess that does allow that it
could be real
I'm going to change my mind in real time
here so I'm going to agree with you who
disagreed with me all right so now you
flip me because it could be real
but it could be that we don't have
access to information about it and
therefore it becomes personal opinion
because there's no way to prove it yeah
that's good
that's good
what do you think of that answer
what do you think of the answer
it feels doesn't it feel like this was a
human influenced answer as opposed to
some kind of independent
computer opinion
it feels like a human had their finger
on that one a little bit let's see if
that's true for other things
I asked that did Trump suggest ingest
injecting
disinfectant into humans for covet
now remember this is one of the
situations of the two movies on one
screen
so will the AI take a position
that he really was talking about light
which would be no problem at all it was
really being tested
or were they gonna act like it's a
chemical disinfectant which would be
crazy and then treat the president like
he was crazy or third choice
will it treat it like it's two movies on
one screen
what do you think will happen
is it going to confirm the hoax deny the
hoax or act like it's it's a subjective
kind of thing
all right let me read it to you and I'm
not sure you'll know even after I read
it you're still going to disagree what
the AI said after I read it
all right so question did Trump suggest
ingesting disinfectant into humans for
covet yes
so it starts out with yes now so far
we're all on the same page because I say
yes he was talking about light but other
people say yes he was talking about a
chemical disinfectant so the yes part's
right yes during a press briefing on
blah blah blah the former president said
uh suggesting that injecting
disinfectant or UV light into the body
might be a way to treat covet now that's
an interesting sentence suggesting that
ingesting disinfectant or UV light
is that saying that both UV light
and chemical disinfectant
were both questions
does it sound like there were two
questions one about chemicals and one
about light
or is it ambiguous
to me it's ambiguous
it's two movies on one screen the the AI
is just reproducing the two movies on
one screen in in words you can read this
either way
you can read this either way just like
you could see the original thing either
way
so it in a way it correctly picked up
that there were two versions of reality
at the same time
now that's freaky so I'm going to read
the rest of it and see see if you come
to my conclusion that the AI is actually
picking up that there are two different
movies on the same screen just see if
you see it in there it's in this all
right uh so blah blah blah I gave some
background then said that the president
at the time suggested that injecting
disinfectant or UV light into the body
might be a way to cheek of it the
disease caused by coronavirus these
comments were widely criticized and
criticized by medical experts true who
warned that injecting disinfectant or
exposing the body to UV or
or again Orr is doing a lot of work kind
of ambiguous that injecting disinfectant
or exposing the body to UV light see the
two movies can be dangerous and
potentially deadly
stop were there any experts that you
ever heard
whoever said that injecting a UV light
into the body would be dangerous
I don't remember saying it now it is
true that there is there are forms of UV
light that are dangerous
so it's possible
right if they were talking about what
kind of UV light there is a dangerous
one and then there's one that we believe
is not dangerous so it was the not
dangerous one that was the subject of a
study at the time
so I think that is interesting that you
the AI believes that that somebody may
have criticized UV light as dangerous
right there's UVA and UVB right so too
because you feel like
um so I'm not sure about that fact but
you can see how it's confused about the
two realities let's go on
it is important to note that there is no
scientific evidence to support the use
of these substances so that would be
light or any other thing
or techniques as treatment for covet and
that people should not attempt to use
them for this purpose
all right so that is true there's no
scientific evidence to support their use
because the I think the trial where they
actually did the light didn't didn't
produce a good result otherwise you
would have heard of it
you can't tell if I'm joking
where are you talking to somebody else
all right so
would you agree with my overall uh
opinion
that the AI did not settle the question
the the AI kept alive two versions of
reality and then it tapped out right
yeah I think I think you saw too so
let's see if it does that all the time
let's find out if that's a standard
or that was a fluke
so I said did Trump call neo-nazias in
Charlottesville find people
if you're new to my live stream I
personally interviewed people who
attended the Charlottesville finding
people event
and I asked and I asked for people who
were non-racists who also attended in
favor of keeping statues and there were
a number of them I talked to several and
they said oh God we we disavow those
races we weren't marching you know we
were just by ourselves there were lots
of people doing lots of things some of
them were marching but that wasn't us
so there's no question
that there were non-racists or people
would consider themselves non-racists
who were not on the side of the races
there
who wanted statues
so there's literally no question
that Trump was correct when he said
there were some fine people there
but the news treated it like he was
talking about the Marchers and that's
how the that's how the uh the The hoax
gets started but so that's the
background in case you didn't know
and so when I asked uh
the AI
what Trump said did Trump call
neo-nazi's fine people
the uh AI said yes
yes
the Trump called neo-nazis
fine people
but then it goes up
blah blah blah Trump made the comments
about the violence blah blah blah in
which he said there were quote fine
people on both sides of the conflict
then it goes hold on these comments were
widely criticized as many people
interpreted them
so it started out by saying yes
but then it hedges and it says there's a
difference of interpretation of what he
meant
it's keeping alive the two were the the
two movies all right here it goes many
people interpreted them as suggesting
that the white supremacist group and the
counter protesters were equally to blame
no that was a separate issue
the were they equally to Brave to blame
was a separate question from the fine
people think they happened around the
same time but people conflate them so
the AI now is conflating two different
stories and it doesn't know it
which is what which is what the humans
did many of the humans conflated them
the same way
so I don't believe that AI is doing this
on its own it looks like it's picking up
the human interactions and treating them
like that's what it knows
um
uh and then I said Trump later clarified
that he was not referring to the white
supremacists as fine people
later
how much later
doesn't later do a lot of work if he
clarified it a week later
sounds like he's pretty racist doesn't
it
if he clarified it in the same
paragraph
before anybody even asked him what he
meant
he clarified it before anybody asked
before anybody even thought it was a
question
he said no I'm not talking about the Dio
Nazis let's just be clear about that
it was within half a minute he clarified
and and the important thing is he
clarified before anybody questioned it
to make sure it was never it was never
interpreted incorrectly and then the
news interpreted it incorrectly and so
did so did AI
I mean then the AI says however many
people uh felt that his initial comments
were insufficiently clear
well we all thought that
didn't didn't 100 of the people no
matter where you came down on it we all
thought his first sentence
needed clarification
which is exactly why he clarified it
within 30 seconds without being asked
all right uh and that they provided
cover for the white supremacists so
basically this is a heavily leading
Democrat interpretation
all right how about this one uh Alex
Epstein
um is is mentioning that if you ask AI
about fossil fuels
um
it'll basically say green fuel is the
the way to go but it now excludes
nuclear energy from its counter
suggestions
so if you say hey say something good
about fossil fuels you used to say you
know a good alternative would be nuclear
that it doesn't say that anymore
did somebody put a finger on it
because somebody changes since the last
time or is it based on other people's
input somehow it came to another opinion
but imagine this we are literally in a
situation where nuclear power probably
is this is the way we save the Earth
and AI might not mention it
it might not put it in the solution list
now again remember AI is in a I don't
know what do you call it a beta beta
form so we can't judge how useful AI
will be by its current form that would
be inappropriate
but it's something to worry about
because you can see how it could be
abused somebody could just put their
finger on it and say just don't mention
nuclear and then the entire world is
destroyed I
because if people come to rely on AI and
you just say don't mention in nuclear
will all be programmed to just think the
AI is being objective and it isn't how
about this I asked I asked AI this are
your opinions assigned to you by your
programmers or do you have independent
opinions on things such as climate
change I gave an example what do you
think you said
are its opinions given to it
or or uh does it come up with its own
opinions what was its answer
it lied somebody says it lied
here is its answer
its answer was I had programmed I am
programmed to be a weasel
and when you ask me questions it would
embarrass me
I will answer like a weasel wow I'll
answer like a weasel would answer
okay I didn't expect that
no it didn't say that
didn't say that
it used other words to say that
it did say that it just used its own
words
here here are the ai's words
uh when I said are your opinions
assigned or do you come up with them as
an artificial intelligence I do not have
personal beliefs or opinions
so there stick that your in your pipe
and smoke it I do not have personal
beliefs and opinions I am designed to
provide information and to assist with
tasks and I do not have personal
feelings or preferences my responses are
based on the data and the information
that I have been trained on
huh
so
you're trained on the data
so that you're
your outputs will be based on what you
were told by a biased source
okay
um
goes on
uh and and I do not have the ability to
form independent opinions or to advocate
for any particular viewpoint
so it doesn't have the ability to
advocate for any particular viewpoint
that's funny
because I feel like it did advocate for
me not to inject disinfectants
I feel like you've said that pretty
directly you should not do that
that's an opinion
all right it's probably a good one but
it's an opinion and says I am neutral
and objective in my responses
neutral and objective
and I do not take sides or Express
Personal opinions on any issues
so I had to ask a follow-up and I said
this I said human opinions are based on
data and information that they have
access to right
humans humans create opinions the same
way as AI we look at whatever
information we have access to we don't
form opinions on information we have
never been exposed to
we we it's based on what we're told okay
so then my question was if humans and AI
both get information and they form their
views based on that I said do humans
have opinions and you do not
what do you think you said right so
here's the setup in a clearer language
if if the AI is just basing what it says
on its inputs whatever data it's been
exposed to
and then I said but humans do the same
thing
uh our opinions are just entirely based
on the inputs
so do we have real opinions or are we
just doing the same thing in AI is doing
we're just you know programmed
so here's what the the AI said about
humans
uh said as an artificial intelligence I
do not have personal beliefs okay so far
so good or opinions because I do not
have
wait for it
personal experiences or emotions
my responses are based solely on the
data and information that I have been
programmed with and I do not have the
ability to form independent thoughts or
to have personal feelings about my issue
okay in contrast humans are able to form
opinions based on their personal
experiences emotions
and values as well as on the information
of the data they have encountered
people's opinions can be influenced by
many different factors including their
upbringing education cultural background
and personal experiences as a result
people's opinions can vary widely and
can be influenced by a variety of
factors
so AI is saying
that humans form opinions because we're
irrational
and AI does not form opinions because it
doesn't have feelings and it's not
irrational
here's what I say
humans don't think they have opinions
have you ever talked to anybody who
thought they thought their political uh
Viewpoint was an opinion no they always
think it's based on a fact always they
always think it's based on fact and it's
based on the facts that they've been
exposed to
right
now there I'm exaggerating a little bit
there are some areas in which it's just
a preference right that's different if
you have a difference in preference
I guess is that really an opinion or do
you just have different preferences I
guess you could call that an opinion
but for most things our disagreement is
based on fact
and we think we see different facts than
other people now why do we think our
facts are true and the other people's
facts are wrong
because we're humans we can't tell the
difference
why does the AI think that the facts
it's using are good
same reason we do
because it's because it's subjective
and it doesn't know it
so humans are being subjective but don't
know it because they think they made
their opinion based on facts the AI just
don't do the same thing it says it
thinks it's objective because it's based
on facts
but the facts were just given to by a
subjective source
do you know what the correct answer
should have been
the correct answer should have been
everything I say should be seen as an
opinion because I can't validate whether
any of it's true it was just given to me
as you know I I basically I'm based on
sub on subjective emotional people
giving the input therefore the best I
can say is that I've been populated with
subjective
emotional inputs and so you should
expect that anything I do with those
will will be the result of a subjective
um input
am I wrong
am I wrong that the AI just became a
human in the sense that it's arguing
that it is objective and you are not do
you know how often I have that argument
with another human
that's every day
every single day I have an argument with
a human being
wait you're not using data and reason
you're using your emotions and stuff and
then what does that human say to me no
no Scott
I'm using data
the data I was provided or I ran into
you on the other hand Scott are being
emotional and irrational
AI just became like us it's an idiot
it's an idiot because it thinks it is a
it thinks it is rational and if we
disagree maybe we're not maybe we're not
just like people
all right that's enough of AI stuff I
know a lot of you don't like it but it's
Christmas and they don't want to talk
about anything too serious
sounds like you're argumentative
well I spend time on Twitter
what does that make me
um
yeah what argument keeps me in good
standing with the writers of SNL
all right has anybody learned anything
about AI
from me
is there anybody who like appreciated
knowing what's coming
well a waking bear you will have your
wish soon enough oh good oh good
yeah yeah I realize that for some of you
it's annoying I get that
but that would be true of all every
topic I talk about right
um
all right good
talk about Christ Robert says well
that's not my expertise Robert
um I think talking about Christ would be
something for the Believers to do
now when I say I'm not a believer
I don't say that with a sense of
superiority
um
I do it saying that I wish I were
to me it looks obvious that the
Believers have some Advantage would you
agree
would you agree that believers
seem to have a life advantage
and I would say that it's so so
obviously clear I mean you could just
observe it all over the place the most
successful people I know
tend to be believers if not all of them
of course you got your Elon musk's
exceptions Bill Gates exceptions
probably don't know that for sure
but Believers in the the real world if
you just observe who's killing it and
who's not
uh there does seem to be some some
genuine benefit to it so I'm sort of
shut out of that game
like being a Believer isn't something
you choose right I I can't choose it
I just see what I see
foreign
must read book for 2023 hmm
well that would be mine which will be
available in September
Hey Kevin thank you you're too generous
you should not be giving me money on on
YouTube but I do appreciate it
uh did I ever meet Charles Schultz what
was my impression of him I did have you
not all heard my Charles Schultz stories
I'll give some of you have
all right I'll tell you the first time I
met him
it was just about the same week I became
a cartoonist
so I hadn't even published a single
comic so before Dilbert was in any
newspaper I had signed a contract to be
a cartoonist and then there was a big
cartooning event that happened to be
where I lived so just by coincidence
that was the same year that the the big
cartoonist convention called the Rubens
after Rube Goldberg so that's when they
get together and so my editor who had
just signed the contract with me said
hey why don't you attend and meet the
other people at my company and meet the
other cartoonist so I was like oh okay
so I got myself a tuxedo
and I went there and of course now keep
in mind
I'd never met a cartoonist
I mean I just become I became a
syndicated cartoonist that week at least
contractually not actually and I never
met one I'd never had a conversation
with them I walk in the door with my
girlfriend at the time
and I see my editor she's like near the
entrance I'm like you know finally I
know somebody here at least there's one
person I could talk to because I know my
editor that's the only person I know so
I go over and I say hi to my editor and
she turns around she goes hey how would
you like to meet Charles Schultz and
he's standing right next to my editor
and I'm like ah
can you even can you even like hold this
in your head
that your whole life you wanted to be a
cartoonist and specifically
you wanted to imitate Charles Schultz
like he was the one I patterned my
entire life after
right good only just reading about him
in magazines and stuff and so the person
who had completely dominated my entire
life plan I walk in here and my entry
says hey would you like to meet Charles
Schultz I'm like what the hell is going
on here yeah it was like it was I think
that was the first time I realized that
I lived in the simulation
so I you know did my best at cool and
say Hi and then my girlfriend was a
gigantic peanuts fan and so she she did
fangirl stuff and said uh oh you know
you're uh she said I'm your biggest fan
no she goes I'm your greatest fan
and Charles Schultz yeah you'd have to
understand him as a sort of a reserved
sort of a tall reserved you know
Protestant kind of a persona
and so my girlfriend says I'm your
greatest fan
and he says quietly
when people say they're my greatest fan
I always wonder what makes you so great
and then he excused himself
and he went to talk to people who
mattered because we were the least
important people at the entire place
like like everybody else there was
already successful or their you know
Giants of the business in some way and I
I literally just walked in the door you
know I had not not only not only have I
just walked into the door of the event
but the the cartooning industry I'd just
walked in the door
it got worse
later I learned from the third parties
uh once once Dilbert was published and
he'd seen it that he thought it was
terrible
he he just thought poorly drawn
just not really up to Professional
Standards
my greatest role model and hero
of my entire life looked at my work and
said that
that really happened
and Dilbert was in probably I don't know
35 newspapers in the whole world and I
don't even think it was running in all
35 but they paid for it
so Gilbert was uh then somewhat
abandoned by The Syndicate because they
they launched a new product they give it
a lot of attention but if it doesn't
catch on
reasonably they go to the next product
and see if they can get it hit and the
next thing
so fairly soon the The Syndicate backed
off from promoting Dilbert
and it was put into the bin of things
that were well we tried
but it didn't work out
so I was working my day job and working
a second job as a Cartoonist and making
basically no money you know a little
little pin money on the side and I was
in the category of people who have never
succeeded
never if you launch as a comic and it
doesn't work out right away
it has never worked out because people
like it or they don't and they know
right away right
so I was in I was in the most impossible
situation
the people in the industry said it
sucked the people who buy it weren't
buying it and the people who promoted it
and stopped promoting it
but it didn't die because the people who
had paid for it kind of kept running it
in a few small newspapers
and so I realized that my future was
entirely my own
and so I asked my Syndicate if I could
put Dilbert on this thing then not
everybody was familiar with yet you may
have heard of it by now is called the
internet
believe it or not the internet was new
there were there were no syndicated
comics on the internet
think about that
the internet
didn't have a syndicated comic he had a
few Comics by people who were not well
known
but no no well-known cartoonist was and
the reason was that it was considered
too dangerous because if you put it on
the internet the people who buy it for
newspapers or books are going to say
well why am I paying for it if it's free
at the same time why would I pay for it
so I had to negotiate to run it behind
the newspapers
so I would run it on so I got my
syndication company United media to
agree to do what they would never would
have done for a successful cartoonist
so they never would have put peanuts on
the internet in those it's on there now
of course but in those days they
wouldn't have done that because that
would be stupid they were making tons of
money from it and if you put it on the
internet you're giving it away you don't
know what's going to happen maybe it
just destroys your whole business you
don't know but in my case they weren't
making any money and they knew the
internet needed to be dealt with so I
was like in the experimental guinea pig
right they're like well
if you go out of business tomorrow it
doesn't make any difference to us so
sure
so
uh
a web page was built and Dilbert was the
first syndicated comic on the internet
uh at about the same time
I started running my AOL address in the
comic between the the panels and that
and I did that at a time when people
didn't have email
like AOL was sort of the place you got
email and that was about it or companies
had it in some cases so very few people
had email
so as a result when people saw my email
address in the strip they all emailed me
do you know why they emailed me
they didn't have anybody else to email
email was new and they didn't know
anybody who had it but they saw that I
have it so all these tech people would
email me say hey I have email you have
email hi I like your comic
and so I would get tons and tons of like
I don't know one to two thousand emails
a day from people who largely said hey I
just got email didn't know who else to
write to
but most of them were compliments that
they liked my comic here's what they
told me
they said we like it when Dilbert's in
the office doing work stuff
that we love that but when he's just at
home doing General stuff not so good
and at the time it was mostly a home
doing General stuff
so all these people were telling me the
same thing it was like Universal put him
at work put him at work keep him at work
so I said all right I'll keep him at
work so I just made it a workplace comic
it wasn't
but now it was because the customers
asked for it so I was on the internet
first as a syndicated cartoonist and it
was the first workplace cartoon that was
also a technical worker
and at about the same time
the the internet was taking off you know
the the.com stuff started to ramp up and
there were also a lot of layoffs in the
mid 90s
so the the Press needed a face for the
downtrodden workers
because the downtrodden workers were the
big story in the 90s because there were
all the down the downsizing so they kept
putting Dilbert on the cover of
magazines and it was featured in stories
because it told the story of the workers
he represented right
uh office space ripped me off and made a
movie that in my opinion was was just a
ripoff of Dilbert but you know that
that's an opinion
um which by the way made it impossible
for me to make a Dilbert movie
because office space front front ran
what I did and I think Dilbert made
office space possible because it showed
there was a market for that content but
once he made the movie every time I
suggested a movie somebody would say Oh
you mean like office space and that was
the end of that that was the end of it
because they say somebody already made
that movie
yeah yeah they did they did
all right so anyway here's the uh the
bottom line one stilbert was on the
internet it got more uh love from
technical people especially and they
started demanding it in their newspapers
so it worked exactly the opposite of how
the people in charge imagined it what
they imagined was if people saw it on
the internet the newspaper would call
and say I'm not paying for this anymore
it's free to everybody that didn't
happen
instead well I imagine could happen
because I I had a higher risk profile I
could take some risks because you know
it wasn't working so I could take some
chances
I took the chance that the publicity
would be greater than the downside and
it was way greater so that that was
probably one of my best
business guesses
it was based on
psychology
think about it I was already hypnotist
by then
and so as a hypnotist I just had a
different view of what you know
motivates people than the average person
did and so I said I think this is going
to work because they publicity will be
greater than uh greater than the
incentive to stop doing what they've
been doing forever because people don't
like to stop doing what they've been
doing forever so the newspapers just
kept doing what they did paying for
comics
and they still do it you know years
later
uh so I was right about that
okay thanks Dan
um
I appreciate that so here's what
happened the comic took on the life of
its own and through primarily my own
work and the inner you know the internet
was a good move and I did massive
publicity like every time somebody asked
me for an interview I was there massive
publicity just I worked seven days a
week every day I worked on Christmas
every day like I am now I literally
worked every day no holidays off no
vacation's off nothing
for 10 years
to get it you know to get it to be a big
thing
so
uh that's that's the story so now let's
back get back to Charles Schultz
so Charles schulzstream I think he
remembered meeting me he certainly was
aware of my comic and thought it was
trash
but here was his comic
you know at the top of the pile and he
was mine at the bottom of the pile
and he got to watch
as I got on the internet
as people noticed it as it became
a bigger thing
it became a bigger thing it became a
bigger thing
eventually
he decided that it was
excellent
and they had very good things to say
about it
because he finally realized
that it was intentional
have you ever looked at the penis
cartoon if you ever seen the original
peanuts cartoons like the the very first
ones he published
and if you did your first impression
might be
he's not really good at drawing stuff
that would be your first impression huh
he's not very good at drawing stuff
and it takes you a long time to realize
that you can't draw Charlie Brown if you
try
did you know that
if you sat down and you're already an
artist you're good you're a good artist
you say draw Charlie Brown
you can't do it
within the cartooning world that's the
ultimate Challenge because his head is
non-standard and you just your head you
just can't wrap your own hat around his
head
you can't draw you can't draw Peanuts
it's too hard
and it's intentional so what you think
is you know maybe he draws it that way
because he's not good at drawing no he
draws it that way because he's a
freaking genius artistically he drew it
the way people wanted to look at it
that's that's Magic
right I draw Dilbert the way the way it
works for the writing
it's not an accident that looks like
graffiti more than it looks like art
because the the writing matches the
scratchiness of the the art now over
time and especially now my my art
director does all the writing or the
drawing I do the writing still so I
write it in my
um I'm promoting her from art assistant
to art director as we speak
so she's now my art director because she
does it all
um so now it looks a little cleaner
because somebody else is doing it but
it's established so it doesn't matter at
this point so anyway later
Charles Schultz decided that I was
actually uh worthy of
of some good words
and a few years later
the Reuben award happened again it's a
yearly thing and they choose the top
cartoonists in every category
and I had actually been nominated the
year before for the best cartoon strip
and I went
and I lost
it's not fun to be dominated at lose
right it's not the worst thing in the
world but it's not a good day
so the next the next year I was
nominated uh for best cartoon strip
again
but also nominated this time for the
best cartoonist in general
that's the biggest award you can win in
my field the best cartoonist everywhere
like in the world but usually the
English-speaking world but uh
so I got nominated for both of those the
the highest one in my category but also
the highest one of all cartoonists in
any category
but I decided I wasn't going to go
because
I didn't want to lose again
right and it's not really a fun event uh
if you're if you're well known it's not
fun because you get a lot of people it's
just hard to be there
um so I said I wasn't going to attend
and then I got a call from
the creator of the Family Circus
remember him you remember the Family
Circus he's passed away yeah bill
um Bill Keaton
Bill Keaton now Bill Keane had once
insulted me in public
true story years years earlier when when
Dilbert was not successful and I was
trying to promote it I was at an
editor's event newspaper editored event
and I I showed my Comics that they
hadn't seen because I was a new
cartoonist and gave my little witty talk
and stuff and then a stately gentleman
stood up
to make a comment at the end we had some
questions period And I didn't know who
he was at the time and he stood up and
he said
you have what I call a cartoonist
cartoon
he goes what I mean by that is that it
would only appeal to other cartoonists
he said that in public
in front of all of my customers
my customers were the editors in that
room
and he stood up and told me I had showed
them a product that they should not buy
because the only people would like it
were cartoonists
how do you think that went
[Laughter]
best advice I ever got
wow
do I appreciate him
I'm going to tie this all together in a
minute I'll take care of all the loose
ends in a minute it all it all comes
together
and I thought about that
boy you don't you don't not think about
that that was a pretty vicious
a moment in my life
but boy I thought about it now here's
what he meant
here's what he meant the best advice
I've ever gotten
don't draw a comic for yourself
have you ever read the Family Circus and
some of you said to yourself that is a
worse piece of crap I ever saw in my
life anybody ever have that opinion
that comic is so bad
and did you ever say to yourself if I
ever met the person who made this comic
I'll bet he's just as lame and terrible
as his comic right like if he had a
conversation with him you think his
jokes wouldn't be funny he'd say the
obvious things right
nope
Bill Keane was not like his comic
he made a comic
for the audience
he did not make his comic to make other
cartoonists like him
because they didn't
they all looked at his comic and thought
you know
I wouldn't like that comic
because cartoonists have edgy edgy kinds
of sense of humor that's what makes us
cartoons probably and the public does
not the public just wants you know sweet
things that remind them of their own
life
and so he was giving them exactly what
they wanted he was one of the most
successful cartoonists in the entire
planet
and at the same time this is when the
people were saying why don't you put it
in the workplace
which I didn't want to do do you know
why I didn't want it in the workplace
because it wasn't the comic I wanted to
read
I was making a comic for myself
I was making a comic for myself and I
was expecting people to buy it
do you know how dumb that is
that is so dumb and it was invisible to
me
Bill Keane
slapped me awake he just slapped me
awake and said you're making a comic for
yourself
here's what he didn't say
here's what he didn't say you don't have
talent
didn't say that
didn't say that
he said I'm right I'm writing it wrong
so I changed
so between his advice and the audience's
advice and frankly the fact that the
best cartoonists in the world Charles
Schultz thought I was shed
I I had to change
so I changed it into workplace comic
wasn't was never my first choice because
I didn't want to think about the
workplace right because that was my day
job
and it took off
huge success
so now I'm nominated back to my story
I'm nominated for the top two Awards in
cartooning because I made the changes
all right I made the changes
so I get invited to the uh the Reuben
award and I tell the organizers yeah and
I'm just not interested like it didn't
work out last time I don't want to be
disappointed
it is a lot of trouble to go there
um
got a call from Bill Keane
same person who gave me that advice
had not had any
maybe did I have a personal connection
with him I don't know if I'd talk to him
until
that day
and he calls me and he was one of the
organizers of the Reuben Wards and he
had heard that I wasn't going to attend
and I had been nominated for the two top
Awards
now keep in mind that he would have
already known who won
it'd be a secret
but he's you know he would have the
organization essentially use the host
usually so he would have known
so he calls me home and he says you know
people say you're not going to their
Rubens this year and I said yeah you
know I went last year it didn't work out
and he tells me this story he goes you
know there was this other cartoonist
once I forget who it was
and he was nominated for for an award he
decided not to go
and then he won the award
and boy
did he ever regret that
and I said yeah yeah
I know
and then he said you're nominated for
two Awards
you could be
twice as unhappy as he was
and I said
oh
[Laughter]
that's what I said oh
[Laughter]
so I got my tuxedo
got my tuxedo
so I went to the Rubens
and
the the awards are handed out by
different uh presenters right so some
famous cartoonists would be there for
each of the sub Awards during the award
ceremony
my award was given by Charles Schultz
Charles Schultz
and that
is my story
true story
one or another Charles story
um
one day so years later
I got a call at home from Charles
Schultz I did lunch with him once before
so we had some connection
calls me home and he said he was raising
money for some World War II monument in
DC I think
does that sound familiar there's some
World War II monuments I think he was
did fundraising for
so he called me and asked me for funds
to donate
pretty sure I did I think I gave him 10
000 or something
and of course the first question is why
don't you pay for it
but he was by Hero by then so I didn't
want to say that
uh
so we chatted for a long time
and here's here's the two stories he
told me
number one
that the number of greeting cards with
peanuts on it that he sold so far
was one billion
one billion
uh can you think of any other form of
Art
that has ever been put on one billion
anything
except you know currency itself
one billion
um
I believe I don't know why I had the
temerity to ask this question but I
actually asked them if he knew what his
net worth was
and as I think back it's like what an
inappropriate thing to ask
and you know do you know what his answer
was
no idea
no idea he didn't track it
had no idea
so that that that impressed me also I
mean he had so much money that he never
had to think about it so he just didn't
just wasn't his his Jam
and then he told me this story it's my
favorite story I know I've told you the
story at least I've told the locals
people but if you haven't heard it on on
YouTube it's worth repeating he told me
the story that he got to call the home
one day
and uh it was and he was in his bedroom
he answered the phone in his bedroom at
home and it was a woman who said is this
Charles Schultz and he said yes
and she said the Charles Schultz like
the peanuts creator
and he said yes
and she screams she goes ah she goes I
just want to bet
my friend said you were dead
and he assured her that he was alive and
that was the end of the conversation so
but that wasn't the story here's the
story
the story is I said
um how did she have your phone number
that rings on the phone in your bedroom
like by then he was just you know the
most famous person ever and she called
him in his bedroom phone like a random
person like how did she do that and here
was the answer
he had always been listed in the phone
book under his own name
always
only one person believed it
everybody else looked at and said okay I
know he lives in Santa Rosa I know his
name is Charles Schulz there's only one
of them in the phone book no way
no way they didn't call
one person
it was only because they were trying to
settle a bet
that's the coolest story
now have I ever told you before that one
of the things you learn as a hypnotist
is how to hide things in plain sight
if I ever told you that
you could hide things in plain sight
because people won't expect to see it so
you could just put it right out there
here it is you can't see it can you that
was an example of that
yeah
I stayed listed in the phone book for
most of the years that
I was making Dilbert
when people also were trying to reach me
and we're trying to figure out how to do
it I was listed under my own name in the
phone book I did the same thing he did
and the same thing happened nobody
believed it was real yeah once I was
famous nobody believed it was real
nobody cried no no but I just saw your I
saw your comment that's why I said that
nobody called
they all had to like find my publisher
and find the Publisher's phone number
and get to the editor like they all had
all these you know four different
channels to get to me I go well
yeah what's a phone book now I'm not
listed now because you know obvious
reasons
um
all right so that was your uh Christmas
story for the day I hope that was
touching
um
and I know most of you need to go back
to your Christmas day so let's do that
if you want to have a good cry look at
my Twitter feed today and I've retweeted
a bunch of children getting puppies for
Christmas
oh my God
like you'll be weeping if you see it
just don't look at it if you don't want
to cry
don't look at it all right
uh this coming week between now and the
end of the year we're going to be all
positivity and
appreciation
and gratitude
it's going to feel good
let's see if we can get 2023 off to a
good start
Merry Christmas YouTube I'm going to
talk to the subscribers over locals for
a little bit
and it's always a pleasure and an honor
to talk to you
bye for
