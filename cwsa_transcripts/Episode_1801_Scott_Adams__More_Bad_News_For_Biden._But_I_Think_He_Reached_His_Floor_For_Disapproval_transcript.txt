it's the other way around but i have a
little technical problem so you're going
to watch me turn on the locals platform
usually they're on first watching
watching it the other way
hold on this is me adding a title with
voice texting
coffee with scott adams july 11
2022
[Music]
come join me to celebrate
7-eleven
period
and
and we're live
hey
so this morning i woke up extra extra
early
to make sure i wouldn't be late
didn't really work didn't work out at
all
turns out
but uh
how would you like to reset and make
this
turn out just right
there's a part that i have to go back to
and redo
it goes like this
there we go there we go
good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with scott adams the
finest thing that's ever happened to you
in your entire life
highlight of civilization itself and
we're going to take it up a level
and all you need is a cover bugger glass
of tiger chelsea style canteen drug
class vessel fanny kind fill it with
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dope meeting of the day
that makes everything better
go
ah yeah yeah that's good that's good
well
um how many of you saw my uh
doorbell video of my doordash delivery
guy stealing a package from my front
door
i posted on twitter
and
you know it's interesting so it's a
package from amazon
but it's a doordash guy stealing it
now the value of the package i can tell
you since i figured out what was in it
was maybe ten dollars
approximately a ten dollar value a very
in fact it was just a
you know a female product for some
cosmetic
beauty purpose
completely useless
now
how much work am i going to put into
correcting this 10 loss
so i've already invested like a couple
hours looking through the video cameras
and you know i've got i've got redundant
video
but i'll tell you my my favorite part of
the video
that you haven't seen because uh the
video i posted is uh is a
view from behind
so you don't see the face of the
perpetrator but i have one from the
other angle that's a complete video so i
can see the whole whole thing so here's
the funniest part
do you think that somebody who walks up
to a house like mine
expects there to be a security video
security there
they should
there are probably zero houses
like mine you know sort of in a certain
neighborhood that don't have video
security
i mean they all do
my my neighborhood has so many cameras
we're we're all organized on a uh
on a whatsapp chat
so if there's even the least bit
suspicious car or person in the
neighborhood all of our all of our
phones light up and then everybody
everybody goes to their video cameras
and all of a sudden you've got video of
like every angle of this guy you know
this person walking through the
neighborhood
we've got so much
so much video footage of anybody who
comes with and you know a mile of our of
our community
so but here's the funny part he had to
know the guy who stole my package he had
to know i had a video camera there
and the funny part is he's looking for
it
so you don't see that on the video i
posted but he backs up
he's got the package in his hand and he
realizes that he still has a chance to
put it down
if he sees a video camera right then
it's not quite a crime yet so you see
him holding the package and he has that
thought and then he does this
and then he leaves because he doesn't
see the cameras
let's just say he missed more than one
you i'm not going to have one video
camera of my front door
i got cameras
cameras i even i don't know where they
are
i can see anything on my house
so anyway uh i sent it to ap and they
asked for some stuff that's hard for me
to find and i'll probably won't follow
up but we'll see
uh and by the way
have you ever had trouble with customer
support
you try to get them on the phone or the
chat thing and it just takes forever and
doesn't work
but i find that if you have a certain
amount of
followers on twitter
you don't need to use customer support
anymore
you just tweet it
and i honestly i feel bad when i do it
because i know not everybody can do it
it's just sort of a
special situation but when i tweet
something like this
it takes about five minutes for the
corporate office to you know stop what
they're doing
so i always laugh there's somebody who
stopped what they're doing today at
doordar at uh yeah doordash
somebody's schedule was a little bit
different today all right
ap has a story out they they say that uh
public trust has eroded
public trust especially in the news
um and what do you think that's what's
that's about
uh here's what the ap said they said for
experts who study misinformation it's
good to know that there are experts who
study misinformation
experts huh
where does misinformation
come from
well that's another story but the
experts who study misinformation in
human cognition they say the fraying of
trust this is the ap
tweet the fraying of trust is in part
tied to the rise of the internet
and the way it can be exploited on
contentious issues of social and
economic change
so there you have it
so the reason for the the change in
trust
is something about the internet and the
way it can be exploited
i guess that's one way to frame it
that's one way
what would be
can anybody let's brainstorm a little
bit can anybody think of another reason
the public would not have trust in the
news
what would it be
would it be would it be because the news
stopped even trying to report news
and just started making up
i'm just going to throw that out as a
hypothesis
could it be
that the public noticed
that the news is not true
but not only did we notice this not true
because i think we could have been okay
with that because that would just look
like a mistake
we all understand that the news gets
updated
so i don't think people would have a
problem with it just being
a mistake
am i right
i mean we'd complain about it but we'd
get over that
mistake's a mistake everybody makes it
but when you realize
that the news is intentionally fake
intentionally fake
then the correct the correct response is
to not trust it
now shouldn't the story be
the public has finally wised up that the
news is intentionally fake
and now they're reacting completely
rationally and appropriately
and it's good news that they don't
believe this anymore
isn't it good news
why are they reporting it like there's
something wrong with the public
and there's something wrong with some
bad characters and maybe something about
the internet
when
really it's just people like the ap
isn't it
isn't just the news
literally and obviously making up
that is the problem
am i wrong about that
now imagine if you will i would imagine
the ap and their experts would argue
something like this i'm just speculating
because i don't know what they would say
but i think they would argue something
like this
they would say
but we're not talking about the news
reports we're talking about the crap
that you see on the internet
yeah now where this isn't the topic
we're not talking about the news
you know we as his problems but we're
talking about rumors on the internet
that people believe that's really the
topic we're talking about
to which i say
do you think people would believe rumors
on the internet
if they had a reliable news source
that could tell them if that stuff was
true or not
don't you think it matters
that they can't check if it's true
they don't have anybody they trust like
a news organization to say you know that
stuff from q
i'm not sure that's all real
okay i guess they did say that
but imagine imagine if the news were
still credible
imagine if the news was credible
or were credible
if the news told you that q is all made
up and it's not real
but everything else that the news told
you sounded pretty credible except when
it was a legitimate mistake wouldn't you
be inclined to believe them
if they had a track record of telling
you the truth and doing a pretty good
job
but they don't
they don't have any track record in fact
as i was tweeting this morning do you
remember
when you were so innocent
that if the news didn't cover a story
what did you assume was true if the news
just ignored a story that you thought
was a story but they don't touch it what
did you assume was true about that
that it wasn't really a story
that they had looked into it
and there was nothing there so they
didn't even need to report that it was
false
it just wasn't there so they just ignore
it
but do you believe that now
in 2022 do you believe that if the news
doesn't cover story the reason is they
looked into it and there's nothing there
no
you are just as likely to believe they
looked into it and found something there
and that's why it's not being reported
so
um
here's another example
of why we don't trust the press
cnn is now going full-throated uh
generation four nuclear is a good idea
and there's a story on there about how
bill gateson is tara power is building a
plant in wyoming
that will be one of these next
generation cheaper smaller safer
kinds of nuclear energy and cnn is
treating it like it's just all good news
and that the problems of the past may be
you know solved by this new technology
now did you expect that
did you expect the cnn would just go
full-throated hey this is looking good
we're going to need some of this
this nuclear energy to solve climate
change it's green it's all green
now some of this may be the change in
management leadership as cnn because
i've been tracking that sort of calling
it out when they whenever they do
something that doesn't look like it's
just complete
i call it out because i'd like to see
[Laughter]
you
that's funny
but bigoted cut it out
but funny
but funny
so
i want to tell you the joke on youtube
but i'll get kicked off so i'm not gonna
we'll keep that at locals the the reason
i have a locals um
you know community they pay a
subscription fee it's because we don't
worry about the getting offended over
there
you can offend me all you want
nobody gets offended over there
um and it's all good people so
you know there's not much to worry about
all right
so
that's a big deal now if you're trying
to to
wonder why the public doesn't trust you
what was it that cnn learned about
nuclear energy
this month let's say that causes them to
do a positive story about nuclear energy
what did cnn learn
that's new
compared to let's say two years ago or
three years ago what's new
well they've got a story about this
power plant but i think it's been at
least five years since this company
existed
longer i think tara power
so it's been it's been a story in the
news for i don't know five years
and the whole time the story was it's
going to be newer cheaper safer
and we're pretty sure we know how to do
it
but now it's news
now this is why people don't trust the
news
because three years ago they they were
reporting the story as the opposite of
what they're reporting now
the opposite ooh nuclear energy it's
kind of scary stuff it's never going to
help us
too slow too expensive
and that was just the opposite and
nothing changed except some years went
by and
and there's a whole lot of persuading in
between
so
uh that's why people don't trust it
here's some new maybe fake news i don't
know
but uh democrats in some pac
uh are accusing republican
representative lauren beaubert
of having had an abortion which her
spokesperson denies and also having been
a sugar baby
escort
which her uh
her people deny
so these are two things that democrats
are saying about her that have no
basis in truth according to her side
according to her spokesperson
now
i was trying to ignore this story
but i realized i couldn't
i i tend to reflexively
defend anything that has burped in its
name
whether it's
dilbert
dogbert ratbert catburk
or in this case
bobert
beaubert
so lauren beaubert is now i'm putting
her under
the umbrella of my protection
just
sort of a random thing it's just because
she has that last name of bert
no other reason do i need another reason
but
um
i believe her when she says that she was
never on a sugar baby website
uh
i'm not gonna finish this damn it i had
a pretty good joke
but i don't know i'm gonna bail out on
that
um
because i just realized there's some
implications to that joke that i hadn't
thought through i hadn't entirely
thought it through
i'll tell you on locals
i'll tell you on locals after we turn
off youtube okay
it's worth it
all right
um
i love watching cnn
try to spin the fact that the uh
that not only is biden's approval at its
lowest level we'll talk about that but
these uh the january 6 hearings in my
opinion are failing
now i think that's purely a point of
view you know the democrats are saying
succeeding
and uh the republicans are saying it
looks like a just a big cluster
there looks like looks like a failure
so of course we're all looking at it
through our own eyes but stephen
cullinson who is a cnn's official uh
attack dog for trump
he does regular opinion columns in which
he just
mocks trump with big sarcastic words
and sometimes reasons
um but here's how stephen collinson
is trying to uh take a win
from the january 6 stuff
because i think at this point it's
obvious that trump's not going to jail
is everybody on the same page there
at this point it's sort of obvious
there's no crime
that that trump will be accused of right
because we would sort of know by now if
they had anything in that area and it
doesn't seem to be
so stephen collinson is trying to
create a win out of this and here's the
first sentence of his piece he goes
whether or not donald trump ends up
facing criminal charges
the house committee probing the us
capital insurrection so of course he has
to use the word insurrection has scored
a critical win
what do you think he's going to say
so the january 6 committee has scored a
critical win
what do you think it is
what would be the critical win
that they have so far
well the way he puts it is the critical
win over the ex-president over trump is
that it's thwarting his effort to cover
up the true horror of that day of infamy
but
why do we care about that
does anybody really care about
thwarting his effort to cover up a true
horror
on that day of infamy no i agree it
would be better to know the accurate
story
and so therefore it would be bad to
cover up anything that the public has an
interest in
but
um
i'm not so sure
that he isn't just saying uh
it worked politically
because i think i feel like what he
wanted to say stefan collison and this i
can't read his mind so this would just
be speculation i feel like he wanted to
say
uh
something different
i i think he wanted to say that you know
something horrible happened to trump and
that from a political perspective
it's a disaster and will keep trump from
your regaining the presidency
but you can't say that because that
would be admitting this is just a
political process
right so you can't admit it's just a
political process so the way he words it
is
that it's a critical win
it's not a political win
because if you called the political when
the entire public would say
you mean you wasted all of our time and
our money over something that's just
politics
because that's what happened if there
had been any kind of a criminal
indictment or even anything close to it
for trump himself
then people would say oh i i see why we
did this
now it makes sense there was either a
crime or a potential crime yeah you got
to look into that stuff
if it's president of course
but nothing like that happened
so now they're going to try to turn it
into a
critical win
do you know why they call it a critical
win as opposed to a political win or a
legal win
do you know how they use the term
critical win not a political win and not
a legal win
it's because it's an undefined term
here he is trying to score a win but the
only way he can describe the win is with
an undefined term
critical
now he he tries to define it by saying
you know there's thwarting his effort to
cover up the true horror but is that
critical
what is critical about having a little
more clarity over something i think we
all understood the basic idea right was
there anybody who thought
all of the protesters were bad
no
is there anybody thought that
none of the protesters were bad no
everybody said some bad people most of
them not
we're all the same page
but to call it a critical win
is clearly signaling that they didn't
get what they wanted
because if you got what you wanted do
you know what you say
here's what we won
you just
here it is
we won an election
we moved the poll numbers one way or the
other
we made money we lost money we changed
the opinion of the public anything they
didn't do anything there was literally
nothing that happened
nobody's opinion got changed i don't
think so
all right so biden's now polling
according to the new york times poll
a 33 percent approval
have we ever seen a president at 33
percent
is there anybody who's uh got access to
carter or
i'm sorry i read the name carter going
by in the comments does anybody have
access to google
was somebody at 28
no
um but there's another poll even lower
uh an interactive poll it's called the
ia polls
and now that biden had an all-time low
of 29
29
have we ever seen a president in the 20s
now that's not an official 20s because
the other pollsters are going to be
higher
but we've never seen that right
now i saw the tweet by adam md
that uh he notes that if if 29 is the
right number of approval for a biden
there were only four percent from the
floor
it's an inside joke
the inside joke is i've noted
that 25 of people will it might be a
different 25
but we'll get every question wrong
you can guarantee that 25 of the public
will get any question no matter how
simple and here's another one
so biden's going to be hitting the
theoretical lowest number of approval
that uh
that our society can produce because i
don't think you can produce lower than
25
and the reason is that 25 will get every
question wrong
just reliably i mean it's just a joke
but it seems true
is 81 million votes really 25 of the
united states
it's kind of close hey somebody somebody
did the math for me
is 81 million how many people in the
united states
uh
how many people are in the united states
380
or 350 somebody says
so it's a broccoli
he got approximately 25 of the public
now not everybody votes right
so
[Music]
that's a funny coincidence
all right so now that biden's down in
the 20s or maybe the low 30s in approval
i want to revisit something
so like many of you i lost a good friend
over politics over trump specifically
and i'm wondering if this is the time to
maybe uh
reach out to him
now a number of people said well he
can't be really be a friend
if he unfriended you because of politics
and i think i was misleading he didn't
unfriend me over politics
that didn't happen i unfriended him over
politics
because he couldn't leave me alone
every day
it seemed like every day i get some
lengthy message
telling me that i was a monster for
supporting trump and you know i get the
point
you know i caught on to his his opinion
fairly early on
by hearing it every day
it was more than i could handle so i had
to just basically ghost him
so i'm wondering
should i reach out
because if once he's now that you've
seen biden as the alternative to trump
i'm wondering if he would say
well i'm sure glad we don't have trump
in there or would he say
uh well okay it's better than having
trump yet it's a disaster i don't know
what he would say
i don't know what he's saying i don't
think i would do a told you so victory
dance i think that would be
a little over the top
but i think he should have developed
some humility about his opinion by now
and i'm wondering if that would help us
have a productive conversation but just
thinking about it
if you're thinking about reaching out to
any of your friends you lost this might
be a good time
i think the timing is good
to make your friends back
all right
do any of you live in uh a fake news
personal life
that's as bad as the fake news politics
i'm just wondering all right have any of
you like had an experience
where your actual life turned out to be
a fake life
i say yes
i wouldn't expect many of you to say
that
yes
explain yes
that your actual life turned out to be a
fake life
well i don't like to get like too deeply
into my personal life
but but i'll just tell you one thing
that happened to me
that just reminded me that we don't live
in the same reality
all right
so most of you know because i'm a public
figure
that um i'm going through completing a
divorce
now it's newer news for you but it's
older news for me so it's like a year in
the process so i'm kind of beyond all
the ugly part i'm in the reflection part
right no
stop saying you're sorry
my point is
that it's old news to me
right so we've we've both moved on
very much right so we've moved on about
as much as you can move on so
everything's good
we've worked out the details and stuff
so everything's good
and i saw her the other day and i
thought to ask this question
did she know why we were getting
divorced
and
she wasn't sure
and then she described a specific
situation
in which she thought i had been reacting
to a story
about us
and she thought that maybe that
that story
that had been on the internet
had influenced me to want a divorce
and i said
what
i'd never even heard of it
i didn't even know what the story was
and in fact when she told me it was the
first time i'd ever heard it
so a year into a divorce
she didn't know why
it wasn't even close
isn't that weird
because i didn't even know
like even even in the general ballpark
of the reason
and i'm thinking to myself i'm pretty
sure we discussed it
but
now i don't want to get into you know my
situation because that's not really the
point the point is do you have any
situations like that
in which somebody who's actually that
close to you and your personal life is
living
at least in their mind a completely
different life
yeah
it's fairly common
you know and i think that once you see
it
you can't unsee it right
once you start tuning yourself to the
fact that we're living in different
worlds
because you used to think that people
were only temporarily living in
different worlds that if you inform them
and you talk to them you'd end up in the
same world maybe you had different
information
it's not that
it's not that i think we've gone to a
higher level of awareness
when we realize that we're all just
living in different worlds and it's not
because we're stupid
it's not because we're under-informed we
might be those things too
but that's not what's causing us to live
in different worlds it's just that we
all make up our own world
that is really important to understand
we just make up our own world it doesn't
matter how smart or well-informed you
are once you get that everything is
easier
your whole life will be
more stress-free
when you realize that we're not
creatures of reason and thought and data
we try to be
but we're not close
we're nowhere in the neighborhood of
being those people but we'd like to be
all right
um
i saw a good uh
so a good joke from uh user on twitter
den lesks
and he says now listen to this carefully
it's a clever joke you have to listen to
all the words
he says at this point i'd rather hunter
biden be our president than joe
hunter lines his blow and screws
prostitutes joe blows his lines and
screws us
so hunter lines his blow and screws
prostitutes but joe blows his lines and
screws us
pretty good
pretty good
all right
let's talk about wokeness
so you've heard my opinion that i think
calling people what they would like to
be called is just good manners
which and then i also resist people
forcing me to do anything
because i'm willing to do
it's good manners but i'm not willing to
do crazy things and i'm not willing to
get punished if i get one wrong right if
i use the wrong term i'm not willing to
take any punishment for it
because i think manners have to work
both ways right a little bit of
forgiveness both ways
so i saw this criticism of me it was in
response to a matt
walsh comment
but the comment was about me it's from
realcam dawg
twitter user
and he says right on right on to matt
walsh about whatever matt walsh was
saying and then he refers to me he goes
uh scott adams
says
scott adams could learn something from
you meaning matt walsh
and then
this user says
he has gone full woke now meaning me in
a show last week he accepted and used
the left's way of using language
i can't even take him serious now
that should be seriously
and it should be i can't
take him seriously
and you should get rid of the even
even doesn't add anything
i can't even tames here take away the
even
and then siri should be seriously
and then you can get rid of the now
because that's the context
right so
i just had to take a pause to fix your
horrible sentence
but he says i can't even take him
seriously serious now
and then he says to me he says he said
at one point quote i don't want a dead
name so i'll be clear blah blah
so he says that
he's sickened by me basically
because i bought into
the left's
requirement
requirement
to which i said to him
uh the part i don't like is when
i said i like the part of wokeness in
which people inform me how they prefer
to be addressed
that's good manners
for example
if a woman wanted me to address her as
ms
or a miss
or mrs
would you object to that
would you object to any of those words i
wouldn't suppose somebody asked me and
this this happens all the time because
i'm a famous person
when people talk to famous people and
they've you know gotten familiar they'll
sometimes say
may i call you scott
to which i say of course that being my
name and everything
um
so we you know it's a it's a normal
custom that we ask people how they'd
like to be addressed and then we do our
best to use it right
now the problem is if you do it wrong
maybe you have good intentions but you
do it wrong
so here's what i said in my tweet i said
i like the part of work news in which
people inform me how they prefer to be
addressed that's just good manners and
then i added the part i don't like
is when people such as this guy the guy
tweeting at me or the lgbt community
tell me there would be penalties if i
use the wrong word
uh then i ended with you can all go
yourself
so it might be this guy who's
criticizing me for being too woke is the
lgbt community
he and the lgbt community are the same
 people
because both of them are telling me what
to say
and
i am happy to use polite terms that
people feel comfortable with always
and i'm i'm completely on board with
that
you tell me what you would like
to be called and i will call you that as
best i can
but to the lgbt community and i've said
this many times
if i get it wrong
and you give me a hard time
 you
 you hard
go yourself with a blunt instrument
just get out of my face
because if you can't give me a little
bit of manners in return well then you
don't deserve any that's how it works
right we're polite to polite people
you know somebody's not polite to you
you get to shoot back that's how it
works
so would i go any harder on the lgbt
community if they came after me for
making a mistake
which is what it would be because i
wouldn't do it intentionally it'd just
be a mistake
would would i be as hard as him as this
guy who thinks i shouldn't use their
word
these are two groups telling me
how to talk there's no difference
one of them is telling me that he's
going to punish me in public by calling
me out and never watching me because i
don't use the right words that
he wants me to use well let me
be clear you are your enemy
you are your enemy if you're telling me
how to talk you're your enemy
because they're the ones who you don't
like because they're telling you how to
talk no don't tell me how to
talk
not the lgbt community not this
 who's apparently not on board
with everything the lgbtq community
wants do not tell me
how i should talk
unless you expect this response you know
it's it's free speech so you can tell to
say anything you want
but you know you're going to get a
response
all right we'll get rid of you
all right um
so
um
and then
here's what a comment back would to me
on my comment was if you're using
preferred pronouns instead of reality
this is somebody else's opinion
that's idiocy
not good manners
not playing pretend with these psychos
so he doesn't want me to like depart
reality
for the purpose of manners what do you
think of that do you think that people
should
depart reality
just to be polite is that a good idea or
a bad idea to re depart reality
to be polite
do you know what manners even are
what do matters have to do with reality
when
when i
go to dinner
and the woman i'm with is served first
what's the reason for that
what would be the functional purpose of
the woman gets served first at dinner
i don't know
what what is the purpose for me opening
a door for another person who is
perfectly able-bodied
i don't know
none of these are really based on
reality
yeah just some bothers you when
some stuff doesn't that's it
so
women eat or somebody says there's a
reason because women are slower so they
have to get their food first
oh nice try
[Laughter]
that was a nicer try than that i would
have imagined
all right um
aaron rupar got a little
public conversation on twitter
there's a clip of governor yonkin being
a virginia being interviewed
and uh aaron rupar
uh tweeted it and
his own words that he put on the tweet
aaron rupart was governor glenn ronkin
on cbs indicates he'd support a full
abortion ban in virginia with exceptions
for rape incest and health
and then i saw other people um tweeting
at him and saying i just listened to it
he didn't say that
and so i thought what
why would you
send a clip around
and say it says hey
when the other people looking at it
i'm listening to it too he didn't say
that
so i listened to it and he didn't say
that
he did not say it
so
what's going on
i mean it's very clearly he didn't say
it this isn't one of those you know
yawning and laurel things
i just looked at and go okay
he didn't even actually even answer a
question like that
right he just sort of did his political
answer that was sort of a dodge but he
didn't answer it one way or the other
and so i said to myself my god what's
happening
and then i thought i don't know it feels
like
he must really believe what he's saying
because sometimes you think maybe
they're just taken aside and they know
it's not true but if they you know
retweet it maybe you'll think it's true
but that doesn't look like what's
happening
i see what you're saying in the comments
i'll get to that
i don't think that's what's happening it
looked to me like he believed what he
said because he said it publicly and he
doubled down and he didn't delete it and
he said it's right there blah blah and
even made fun of people for reading
comprehension if they didn't hear it too
and i didn't hear it
and then
i reread his
tweet
it says he indicates
and i thought oh wait i was listening to
see if he said it
he didn't say it
but if you say he indicates
that does say that you're it's an
opinion right
so the word indicates suggests that
aaron rupar's opinion
is that he's revealed his inner thoughts
and on that
i actually agree
i agree with that as an opinion
meaning that you don't know we don't
know his inner thoughts but i think it's
a perfectly reasonable opinion once once
you heard the video that you would say
that the governor was avoiding a direct
answer to the question
but he was so obviously avoiding the
direct answer
that it did indicate that maybe he would
go there however i will add this
caveat
there are two reasons he might
uh
not want to answer the question
one is that he's signaling that he would
in fact be in favor of a total ban
but he doesn't want to say it on tv
because it'll hurt him
the other is that he doesn't want to say
he wouldn't support it
because he would lose votes either way
so the politician thing is just to not
answer a question you don't need to
answer
because if you do answer it somebody's
not going to like it
but if you don't need to answer it at
all
you don't give people reason to vote
against you
so i think the way he answered it was
clever but it opens up two possibilities
one is that he wasn't answering the
question because he doesn't want to say
yes but also because he didn't want to
say no they both would be bad for him
politically
so aaron rupar's
i guess i'll call it an opinion
that good reading comprehension would
suggest that his avoiding of the
question
is a pretty strong signal of which way
he would go
and on that i would say
that's a fair opinion
but it needs to be
clearly an opinion
because i'm i'm not quite there but i
could see how he'd say it
so so it had aaron presented this as
purely his opinion of what the other
guy's opinion was i'd be okay with that
so i'm trying to be fair here because i
have
criticized aaron rupar for editing or
for tweeting videos that were edited to
be misleading this is not one of those
this is one in which he said
exactly what he thought and if you
really take the time to
you know deal with it with the exact
words he used
i'm okay with it
you know i disagreed with it on first
first exposure but i think i would i
would allow that his opinion is within
the bounds of reasonable opinions
even if wrong
well
have you all wondered if elon musk had a
secret plan that was not really revealed
to you about twitter
has that ever occurred to you as like
i feel like
there's something missing
right
and i think we just found out what it
was
so elon musk
uh
retweeted a meme or tweeted it
and the meme was four pictures of elon
musk with four
fake quotes right so it's not what he
actually said was like you know lining
up with on the locals platform you can
see the beam because there they can
paste it in the comments so it's going
by right now
but the
so i'll just read what the meme said the
first panel said they said i couldn't
buy twitter the second one says now they
wouldn't disclose the bot information
then they wouldn't disclose it he goes
now they want to force me to buy twitter
in court
so so far that's what's happened right
that just describes what happened
and the fourth one says
now they have to disclose bought info in
court
what
wait what
seriously
if they sue him
to complete the deal
will he have will that give him enough
let's say
purchase
well that's a misleading word in this
case will that give him enough traction
that legally he can get their bot
information
through discovery but the question is
the discovery has to be relevant to the
question right
i don't know if the discovery would be
relevant enough to the question would it
because i think you could argue that
that's not the point
if twitter to were to argue that it
doesn't matter what the reality is it
only matters what contract you signed
and i think they would
then i don't know if they would have to
give them that information would they
his claim is that they didn't provide it
but what if they just don't provide it
again
because what if what if they give the
court the same thing they gave elon musk
because they say that's all they have
now the court could put people on
you know
they could put them under oath and say
is that really all you have
you know really you know find an actual
programmer who would be in charge of
like collecting that data and just put
the program on the stage or on the stand
stage put them on the stand and say all
right you're the programmer
is this really all the information we
could get are you seriously saying
seriously
that you can't tell how many bots there
is with internal information now if the
engineer says we really can't then i
don't know if any discovery is necessary
is it
because if the person who could give us
this information says it's not
obtainable
you know it doesn't matter if you want
it it's not obtainable
well then nothing happens and maybe elon
musk loses but do you think this is a
real thing
that he could actually force them to
give him accurate body informations and
they have it
what if they have it
i'm not so sure that they have it
if you've ever worked in a big
corporation and you're in charge of data
like i was i worked for a big
corporation two of them in both cases i
was one of the the data guys right if
somebody wanted to know what was true
data wise they came to me
they asked me and i would tell them what
was true because i had the data usually
financial data
and
how often
how often was my data wrong
what do you think
how often was my data so wrong that it
wouldn't help you with a decision
25
yeah all the time all the time the date
is always wrong in one way or another
there's always some context missing
timing differences that sort of thing
so i don't know this is but if it turned
out that that's what
elon musk
had in mind all along and i won't say
that he had one path all along because i
can't imagine him being a one path guy
again this is mind reading right but i
can't imagine that elon musk thinks of
his
strategies in terms of there's one thing
i'm going to do and only that and i'm
going to get it done i feel like
he's intellectually flexible
so that he has several paths that could
work
and he's monitoring them at all times
and oh this one just opened up so we'll
take this path
so maybe maybe he thought of this the
whole time and that was the track or
maybe not
i don't know
and then my last line of notes seems to
be something that was left on the
printer
that has no application to anything
we're talking about whatsoever
and so ladies and gentlemen
even though i was late today
super late
i think i delivered the best live stream
you've ever seen in your whole damn life
what's the matter
oh okay
all right so i'm seeing lots of memes go
by
um
the soap the sip was a bit rushed you're
right
printers are my worst enemies the dutch
farmers
i don't know is there much to that story
they're protesting
they're not happy
oh tell us the joke
remind what was the joke i wasn't going
to tell you
oh i know it was the offensive joke over
here all right
all right um that's all for now
oh about bober all right well i'm going
to tell the uh the locals people what i
was going to say
and that's all
who is uh pedophile i don't know
um
the you go the uganda gold story i don't
know what's that
so there are farmers revolting in more
places
dutch farmers are trying to avoid a sri
lanka situation is that what they're
doing
all right
uganda found as much gold underground as
there is in the entire world well that's
a good story i'm going to go catch up on
that i didn't see that in the headlines
today
not
true all right so here's another story
that i somehow skipped over
uh
this is older data it's like seven years
old but it probably hasn't changed that
much
29 of adult women
are taking drugs to help with mental
illness
or mental health
29 that was seven years ago so
do you believe that number
i
but here's the problem if 29 are taking
a drug for their mental health
how many of them should be taking a drug
and are not
because there's no way that 100 of the
people who have mental health problems
are taking drugs right it might be
half
the other half don't know that a drug
could help or they're too degraded to
get their own help
or they think they're fine or
they don't have health insurance so they
don't have time
but i feel like
i feel like
it's close to 50
would either have a mental health
problem or need it
now
actually let me ask this i'm going to
ask you the two most sexist questions
you've ever seen in your life
and this will show me how much of a
terrible terrible person you are
i'm going to ask you first for women and
then for men
now forget about what drugs people are
taking so the following questions are
not about drugs
they're about what percentage of men and
what percentage of women
are actually having mental health issues
that are substantial
what percentage of women in 2022 adult
women
do you think have substantial mental
health issues
adult women
and it has nothing to do with medical
treatment just how many i'm going to
read i'm saying half 40
35 90
90 90 75 all over the place high numbers
though
a lot of numbers over 50 percent some of
them as low as 20 percent
over on youtube numbers are really high
two-thirds something all right now you
sexists
stop your answers for a moment
because i want to get the same
uh for men
all right adult men what percentage do
you think have a mental health issue
uh
everything from zero to hundred
sentencing but i'm seeing lower numbers
across the board which
which is compatible with the study i
just told you
that men at least are reporting less i
don't know if they have less but they
report less
all right i feel it's closer to
eighty percent both male and women
eighty percent
that my definition of uh substantial
mental illness is something that really
is affecting your life every day you
know not something that's just a
fleeting thought but it just really
affects your life every day i think 80
of both
and the reason is uh the society
has changed to the point where it's not
meeting our basic needs
and when society doesn't meet your basic
needs
you have a mental situation
that is not healthy
so i think that 80 of us are in a mental
health crisis of one way or another
um
so now that you've made now that you've
made assumptions about other people
we're going to talk about you
now this might have more to do with my
audience
now here's what i expect my audience is
more male than female by quite a bit
and more conservative than democrat by
quite a bit
i would guess that if i asked the men if
you have mental health issues
that most of you would say no
so i'm going to ask that
right so because most of you are men and
most of you lean right how many of you
for yourself you're only going to talk
about yourself
do you have
mental health issues
some yeses
nose a lot of yeses
yup yup yup nose nose yes nose a lot
more yeses than i expected but i'm not
sure we can uh know what percentage that
is because people would be more likely
to say yes if it is yes
a lot of yeses a lot of guesses
yeah and so here's my take
even the people who say they don't
they actually do
it's just they have not chose to define
it as a problem yet
they just think it's something else
and
yeah so the question is what percentage
of men
who are watching right now
believe that they themselves have a
mental health issue that's substantial
now
of course i generalize everything from
myself as the rest of us do
and i feel like i'm probably more
mentally strong than
just about anybody
and i don't know if it's
because i'm awesome or just because i'm
older
or had that on more times than
other people so i got hardened by i
don't know but it just happens to be my
situation
i feel i have more mental health than
most people and yet
i feel like i'm always on the edge
let me think about that
i mean in a way i guess
um
i'm the exception that could prove a
point
in order to be the exception and to feel
that you have basic solid mental health
in 2022 you still feel like you're on
the edge
i still feel like i'm standing on a
ledge
and the ledge is nice and solid
like my mental health i'm on a good
ledge
but i feel like insanity is just like
one step
do you have anybody feel that
that even if you feel like you're in
good shape right now you're just you're
just one step away from falling off the
ledge into total mental torment and
and complete
dissolving of yourself
so he says move out of california yeah
maybe
maybe
now here's my take on it i think that
society has you know changed with
smartphones and social media and stuff
so it's just unpleasant to be alive
that's what i think i think it is simply
unpleasant to be alive
if you haven't noticed what's happened
in the dating
situation
there's a dating holocaust going on
that is awful
you don't see it if you're out of the
dating game you don't see it it goes
like this
uh everybody who's above a certain level
of attractantness
you know it's pretty high let's say
we're going to be cold and callous and
say
if you're an 8 or better
out of 10. the people who are an eight
or better first of all what percentage
of the population is an eight or better
not much
not much
10
15 tops yeah 10 percent something like
that
the top ten percent
are absolute
now you might not notice that
if you're not
if you don't know anybody single
but male or female
absolute
complete total
above a certain level of attractiveness
now because i'm not above that level
i only get to hear about it
from both men and women
from both men and women
and
uh
they're all with multiple partners
above a certain attractiveness
now
here's what the problem is
the people who just want to get on a
dating app
and just meet somebody nice
everybody's trying to find somebody
who's a little better than they are
but they're not on dating apps if you
just go to match.com
all right i'm going to tell you
something
uh
i have to turn off youtube now so the
next part is just for the locals people
but thank you for joining
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
