good morning
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and you've never had a
better time
that's for sure
and I don't want to oversell today's
live stream but
I feel like it might be the best ever
I mean I got notes
we've got subjects we've got humor we've
got interesting Concepts it's all here
and if you'd like to take it up to
levels they could only be described as
stratospheric
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker jealous diet I canteen
geographica vessel levitic eye and fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous go
hello from Atlantis
I didn't know that was still with us but
apparently it is
I don't know where to start
of course I'm going to be talking about
Twitter
but there's so much in the news today
it's like crazy
so let's just Jump Right In
I hope you're exercising or cleaning
your house or commuting or doing
something for which this content will
will raise you up
all right
so uh Kirsten Cinema
Arizona senator has quit the Democrats
to become an independent
so there's that I wonder why uh Kirsten
Cinema would pick now
why now an interesting time but she's
got some complaints about the Democrats
being too political
too political yeah so she'll be an
independent
so I wonder if there's I think like any
related information that would uh kind
of give us any insight on
Kirsten Sigma
changing changing parties I wonder why
that would happen
huh
well you know in a completely unrelated
way
um Rasmussen
polling company did a tweet today
and I think it was last year or so they
asked this poll question but we hadn't
seen it until now
um they asked arizonans who did they
vote for
in the election in which Cinema won
against McSally the Republican candidate
now since we know that Cinema won the
election
if you ask the people in the in the
state who did you vote for
it should be very close to what the
actual vote was right
I mean one thing for sure is that it's
not going to be way off
like it's not going to be completely
different
like in an obvious way from the actual
vote
so when Rasmussen ask people who they
voted for 37 of them said they voted for
the winner Cinema
and uh 46 but that 46 percent of them
said they voted for the person who lost
McSally
um have you connected the dots
here it is
there are only two possibilities people
two possibilities one a professional
polling company
forgot how to do a poll
they just don't know how to poll
like all their other polls have been
fine and they're usually one of the
better ones for accuracy in presidential
elections
but maybe just this one time
even though they checked their numbers
maybe maybe they just forgot how to do
this polling thing do you think that
could be it
because it would suggest
that the actual election went to the
loser
do you think that many people forgot who
they voted for
if you reproduce this for another
candidate at another place at another
time would the result be close to what
the actual election was
or would it be off
by the difference between 37 and 46
which is pretty pretty big difference
yeah it's a big difference
now of course
this is only suggestive of what
might have been a problem
it's not proof
would you agree
yeah a poll is a statistical likelihood
kind of a situation it's not proof it's
not like you direct witness saw
something
but uh I wonder is anything else
happening around now
that would make you question the
official narrative about things just
things in general
anything is there anything happening in
the world that would uh I don't know
influence your trust in what the people
in charge have told you is true with
anything
well let's talk about what else is in
the news see if you can maybe tie it all
together
see if you can maybe
find a theme today is there a theme in
today's news Maybe
could be
so um
well I wish I had not gotten all of my
many notes out of order
but uh
speaking of Rasmussen
actually before we speak of them
the CEO of coinbase coinbase is the big
exchange that was the big competitor to
FTX the crypto exchange that we know now
was a gigantic fraud situation and
bankrupt and the CEO of coinbase says
uh I'm paraphrasing now
um why is the CEO of FDX not in jail
is it not obvious to everyone involved
that he just stole 10 billion dollars
and he's walking around like he's your
Barber or something
like like it didn't even it didn't even
register as a crime
now to be fair
here's here's the second theme for
today's show
this theme is important because it's
going to come up with some of the other
uh topics the theme is s if you're a
citizen of the United States you are
innocent until proven guilty
so I'd like to hear his defense
I can't imagine my my imagination is not
good enough to imagine it's not exactly
what it looks like
it looks like you stole 10 billion
dollars
that's what it looks like
but he's he is a citizen of the United
States
and as a citizen of the United States I
extend to him the privilege of all
citizens of the United States
innocent until proven guilty
now of course I'm going to make you know
I'm going to make a little uh exception
or be flexible if it's really really
obvious what the crime was right if the
police capture somebody with a smoking
weapon
and there's a bunch of dead people and
Witnesses and video cameras I'm not
going to say that one's innocent until
proven guilty right if the news is just
like confirms it Beyond any doubt
but FDX is complicated it's complicated
it's entirely possible
that he gives you a defense that says oh
he was just stupid or incompetent it
wasn't the Criminal Intent that you
imagined as possible
uh you know
I I think is very unlikely
very unlikely
but it's possible
so as an individual I give him that
privilege of of assumption of Innocence
do we do we extend the Assumption of
Innocence to our government or to Big
corporations
is that is it reasonable is it ethical
and moral to extend that assumption no
it's not it's not the opposite in fact
for big entities who have much power
over you you know when there's a big
Power in Balance like the government
versus The Citizen in that case they are
definitely guilty until a proven
innocent meaning if they can't provide
some transparency about their systems
you should as a reasonable ethical moral
person assume they're guilty
that should be your Baseline assumption
and you should act like that's true
but if they can prove they're not or
they can make their system transparent
so everybody can see for themselves
then then revise your opinion
but start with
citizens innocent
big entities guilty that's your starting
assumption
to be a you know a wise good citizen in
the Republic
let's talk about banning Tick Tock and
see if there are any uh assumptions we
could make about the government
um speaking of Rasmussen they did a poll
on Tick Tock found out that two-thirds
of Voters are worried about Tick Tock
and that China could use it against
Americans and they support Banning it
so two-thirds of the public bands that
now one assumes that the people who are
opposed to Banning it would either be
people who love using it or people may
be not up to date on the subject or
maybe just people who are you know
radical about
freedom I guess even if it has a cost
so
so that's that's about what I would have
expected
is that is that about what you expected
two-thirds of the public would say get
rid of it does that feel right it feels
right to me
like that that's that's right in the
that's right in the pocket of where I
would have expected it to be
so um
I don't know I
I I know a lot of you are modest
a lot of the people who watch this live
stream are modest but if there's anybody
who wandered in here is not a regular
you know maybe a YouTube you haven't
seen this before
um I hate to do this to my followers but
I'm going to ask you to be non-modest
just for a moment
sort of a demonstration like if you
could just take your modesty and put it
in the side because I want you to show
off for a little bit
do you tell me
what percentage of adult American voters
without any hints you tell me with your
psychic abilities what percentage of the
public
thinks that Tick Tock should not be
banned
you know every time you do this I get
more impressed
I I think well okay you got lucky last
time how do you do this yes 24 percent
24. yeah you're within the margin of
error like
I I don't know you just keep impressing
me you keep impressing me I don't know
how you do it yep it said that was
exactly right
um and now here's the second question
you know that there is bipartisan
support in Congress
both the Democrats and the Republicans
both say with full voice
some of them not all of them that should
be banned so it's a bipartisan issue all
right now here's the question for you
you're all you're all wise consumers of
the news and you know the tick tock's a
big issue
tell me the name of a member of Congress
or anybody in the Biden Administration
who is opposed to Banning it anybody
just give me the name Democrat
Republican independent
now somebody somebody who actually said
it out loud I'm not talking about people
who you think not people you think
believe it
I'm talking about people who said it out
loud
nobody
nobody
no Harris didn't say it out loud I don't
even need to check I know that didn't
happen the the only people who have said
out loud
democrat or republican the only and only
people who've even said anything out
loud said Bannock
you give me a fact check on that right
give me a fact check am I wrong
that everybody who spoke out loud
democrat or republican 100 of them said
ban it
am I wrong
right I believe I believe I'm correct
now
can you explain to me
why
if everyone is on the same side
and it would be a fairly easy thing to
do right probably I don't know if it's
legislation or executive order I don't
know what it is but it would be easy as
long as everybody agrees because there's
no complexity here is there the
complexity is oh it looks like it's
risky we don't know but why take the
chance so take it out of the take it out
of the app stores and you're done it
could be the easiest law you could ever
pass
give me any give me any reason that you
that doesn't use the word corruption to
explain it well I do have two hypotheses
so believe it or not there are two good
hypotheses
um
one comes from a Twitter user on
Hoodwinked
who's a fun follow if you want to add
somebody on Hoodwinked one word
and
explains I always like it when people
explain back to me my own opinions
but they do it well so in this case he's
doing it well says quote people seem to
be more motivated by the thought of
losing something than by the thought of
gaining something of equal value that
quote is from Robert cialdini who's sort
of the The Godfather of persuasion and
somebody I speak about all the time
and
and so on we're doing to ask this
question
wisely why would the Democrats anger
their addicts because the people who use
tick tock or addicts why would they
anger their base
um
given that they have nothing to replace
it with
now they do have something to replace it
with you can replace it with Tick Tock
videos and I'm sorry with Instagram
videos but you could you could have an
American company feeding you the videos
it's not like you would have no access
to videos anymore The Tick tockers would
just move over to Instagram and it would
just take off
but
so that's a possibility I like that I
like that as a potential explanation
don't you
that that passes the sniff test
is something that would make their
voters unhappy and they don't have
anything to soothe sue them or explain
why they're making them unhappy because
you know National Defense is not going
to be good enough for a tick tock user
there's no tick-tock influencer
who is going to say oh I sure liked
being a tick tock influencer and all of
the benefits I was getting from that but
you know now that you mentioned there's
a risk with China I think I'd rather
that you turn it off
nobody right so it's like not like a
tick tock influencer is ever going to
agree with the government
now as Jack Murphy also on Twitter
points out in the tweet
um
he says if and when the Biden
Administration stops hosting Tick-Tock
influencers which they've done perhaps
then the writing will be on the wall but
until then they are they aren't just not
Banning it they're using it for their
agenda
so that passes the sniff test too
doesn't it
isn't that exactly what would make sense
is that there's no politician who wants
it that nobody thinks it's good for the
country
but there are enough politicians who
think it's good for their re-election
that not only does tick tock you know
help them get their message out
but if they took it away it would make
their voters very unhappy
so that's the whole story isn't it
I don't see what else could explain
well you know the other possibility is
they're taking bribes from China but I
think uh on Hoodwinked and Jack Murphy
have the superior hypotheses
I think the superior hypothesis is not
that China is bribing our politicians
could be I mean anything's possible but
I think the the better the better is
that the Democrats know it would be to
their disadvantage and they have too
much power now so there's nothing that's
going to happen
but why does the Republicans not do it
ah how about that remember Trump wanted
to ban it and it didn't get done and
there I don't remember who stopped it
now my understanding is that's the
treasury Department who's researching it
right now
does does giving it to the treasury
Department to research does that sound
like an Administration who wants it to
be banned or an Administration who wants
the issue to be delayed forever
which sounds more like
more like what that would do ah I really
want to ban Tick Tock let me turn it
over to an unrelated bureaucracy and
have them wrestle with it for months
does that sound like somebody who wants
to ban tick tock
no that sounds like somebody wants to
look like they're doing something but
they definitely don't want to ban tick
tock
so you give it to the treasury
Department you say hey take your time
you got to get a committee together
you know maybe we do some research and
I'll bet you'll never have enough
information I'll bet you'll never know
enough to make a recommendation but
we'll wait we'll just keep waiting
so that looks like what's happening
right now if you were on the uh
locals subscription service
uh you would hear more about this topic
that I won't be telling you on YouTube
sorry uh
but there's more more to this story
here's my prediction
my prediction is that Tick Tock will be
banned before June of 2023.
and here's a reason for the prediction
they're definitely not going to ban Tick
Tock Before Christmas
everybody agrees with that right so even
if they were inclined to they wouldn't
do it before Christmas and make
everybody unhappy
so it's going to be after Christmas
but they can't wait too long you know
why
why can't they wait too long
the Democrats I mean they can't wait too
long because it's free money
for the Republicans the Republicans just
have to walk up to this topic and look
down at the table and there's a big pile
of free money
all they have to do is say well we'll
ban tick tock
and then two-thirds of the country says
oh okay
that sounds pretty good
so
yeah it's not it's not literally cash so
when I say money on the table I mean
figuratively speaking
figuratively speaking
somebody says after the IPO so there's
also a hypothesis that some investors
have enough money in Tick Tock that you
have to wait for it to go public so they
can get their money out
once they're cashed out then the money
people will allow their little pets of
the government to ban it
Maybe
that would certainly be a
follow-of-the-money explanation so now
you have three
three pretty good explanations for why
there could be no politicians in favor
of keeping it and yet nothing happens
and I think maybe it's a combination of
all that
yeah as long as long as 12 year olds
can't vote so I think the Democrats are
going to have to take the issue away
from the Republicans because it's just
too available and easy for them to just
pick it up they have to take it away and
they have to get they have to take it
away as soon as they can
so it doesn't doesn't get close to the
2024 election
so I think before June of 2023
that's my prediction
um
yeah see
well
you want to talk about uh Brittany
greiner's released
so as you know with WNBA player Brittany
Greiner who plays for the the popular
and WNBA team the uh
the uh
well I'm just going to roll through in
my mind all the names of different WNBA
teams that I'm familiar with
there's the uh
the
unicorns uh that might be a team
um how about the uh
the shooters the uh the Mustangs
I don't know
I don't know but I'm assuming that they
have actually teams team names right
does the NBA have actual teams
in them names and stuff
probably probably but anyway we respect
the WNBA uh although we don't know
anything about them I think it's
basketball
it's like a basketball thing
I don't know I've never seen it but I
hear I hear great things about it anyway
the uh we're being told by the Biden
Administration
that uh Russia gave them a choice they
could trade
for The Merchant of death arms dealer
who killed more people than you know
maybe Hiller we don't know
but uh
they traded that guy for but only one
they would only give us one person in
return and it could either be
um
it could either be the ex marine Paul
Whalen who's being held over there for
reasons that appear to be trumped-up
charges
uh or the WNBA player but as Biden's
spokesperson who is and this is
important to the story
otherwise I wouldn't break it up
spokesperson is both black and lesbian
now coincidentally
um
Brittany Greiner is both black and
lesbian
both black and lesbian so when the Biden
administration had a choice of who to
bring back the adult white male who
served this country as a Marine or the
black lesbian uh basketball player
uh the the spokesperson said that they
valued her being black and lesbian
and so they picked her
just just sort of let that settle in for
a moment
I listened to it and I thought well
you're not going to say it directly
right you're not going to directly say
we favored her for being black and
lesbian
because you wouldn't say that out loud
right
and they did
she actually said it out loud
she said that that was that was a
variable and if you were going to choose
between the two
they put a priority and they said it
directly a priority on her being black a
lesbian because that made her a role
model
you know who's not a role model in this
country
a white male Marine who defended the
country
that would be not a role model
that's the opposite of a role model but
what you want is a law breaking drug
dealing not dealing drug doing I don't
mind the drug part actually uh
athlete who's black and lesbian which is
an advantage two advantages
three advantages she's female she's
black and she's lesbian she's got three
advantages so of course you want the
valuable one to be let out
do you know what I fear
I fear that I will someday be captured
by
an adversarial country
you know because I'm exactly the kind of
guy that they want to pick off the
street you know I think I'm just
traveling overseas
go into an exotic place and I get picked
up by the country and jailed on some
trumped-up charge
and that would be bad enough but the
only thing I fear is that at the same
time they put me in jail
they also picked up a black lesbian WNBA
player
and then then my Embassy got a message
to me and they said Scott Scott good
news
uh we made a deal that we can get one of
you out of here
and I would say one of one of us what
are you talking about you know there's
two of you there are two of you that
have been you know illegitimately
captured and we're pretty sure we can
get one of you out so good news and I
thought you're like all right all right
who's the other person
[Laughter]
right who's who's the other
person
all right so so let me say this as just
clearly as I can your government has
gone full racist they did it right in
front of you
right in front of you and they didn't
they didn't pull their punch they didn't
hide it
they said it directly White lives don't
matter that much
and they said it in direct language with
no no hesitation
that the role model of an adult black
lesbian
uh was
like something that needed to be
protected and this American ex-marine
not so important they actually told you
white lives didn't matter
I mean I'm paraphrasing
but that's what I heard I heard White
lives didn't matter because I don't see
anything happening to get Paul well in
that of prison do you
yeah no they're going to let him
die there oh by the way did you know
that he was a trump supporter
did anybody mention that that the one
that they're is a trump
supporter
yeah
now that's an impeachable offense
that's an impeachable offense
you were the administration went full
racist and didn't hide it they didn't
hide it and they left him there because
he's a Trump supporter if you
tell me there's any other reason that
they left him there then besides the
fact that he's in you know a trump
supporter your life
because everything you suspect about
your government has to be assumed to be
true
what you what you believe about any one
individual in the government well
they're innocent until proven guilty if
it's one person
but not the government it was the
government that decided to discriminate
based on race
based on political preference based on
maybe gender preference
that was a decision they did her right
in front of you
and they hunted again another adult
white male and they just left in
there and he's still there
can you tell me that we don't have any
leverage over Russia
nothing
in your wildest imagination can you
imagine Trump leaving him there
now Trump would have gotten both of them
out you agree with that right
Trump would never would have said oh you
you're only going to let me have one do
you know what Trump would have done
I'll tell you what Trump would have done
he would have picked up lavrov wherever
he is
that's what he would have done he would
have locked up their foreign
minister
tell me you wouldn't you tell me he
wouldn't do that yeah he would and i
would support him on it
now of course we'd have to get all of
our diplomats out of Russia
but I'd do it
I'd close the embassy in Russia I'd pull
out every American and then I would grab
the highest ranking Russian I could find
anywhere I'd put him in jail and
say you're holding a Marine
did he hear us you're holding our marine
Red Line
Red Line
Red Line
everything's on the table now
everything's on the table you gotta let
that guy go everything's on the table
that's what Trump would have done
and he would have gotten both of them
back
and then he would have murdered The
Merchant of death before he got off the
plane
you want to give him a give him a last
meal that has like a Time release
capsule in it or something but I'd
definitely kill that guy you got to kill
that guy but
I think you would have gotten our people
back now I'm not saying that Trump
should be our next president because I'm
not on that team at all I'm just saying
it's easy to see that this was a
solvable problem if somebody wanted it
solved
it's clear they didn't want this solved
or they're terribly incompetent one or
the other
and like do you think do you think
Russia would have given up everything
just to keep this one Marine
I don't but I would have risked
everything to get him back
because that's that's just got to be how
it works right you can't send to your
Marines over there to protect you if
you're not going to protect them
like nothing works that way that the
world doesn't work that way you've got
to be on their side
or don't send them over to kill people
on on your behalf
all right
um
what is what is currently the
friendliest country in the world for a
adult white males if I have to move
the serious question
if if I want to move someplace where an
adult white male would do well where
would that be Poland
Romania
Iceland
Japan I don't know
Thailand
I think Tyler there are a lot of
countries that can go both ways right
you know they might hate you but they'll
treat you well you know so they might be
racist against you but you'll still do
all right God I feel like Thailand
would be a place where you would do fine
as an adult white male but they maybe
they don't like you that much privately
Ukraine Ireland I don't know but it does
feel like it's not not a friendly place
to be anymore for all of us
um
did you know
that Twitter can read your DMs
did you all know that you know that the
Twitter employees they can just look at
all your private messages
you should have known that right the
reason that the reason that encrypted
apps exist
is that unencrypted apps
whoever runs them can look at them
have you ever put anything in a DM that
you didn't want
the world to see
don't do that don't do that yeah I you
know of course you know I re I replayed
my past history to I asked myself have I
ever DM something
that it became public
that would be a problem
and the answer is of course
of course I have but not a big problem
right you know it would be like one new
cycle of
cartoonists said this thing that
surprises you and it would be out of
context because probably it wouldn't be
anything bad I don't I don't think I've
ever put anything
I don't think I've ever put anything bad
in a DM
but definitely I've put opinions there
I've I've had opinions there that maybe
I've not expressed in public
so maybe those would be embarrassing but
they would be easy to defend it just
would be something I hadn't yet defended
so I think I I think I'd be fine as far
as I know
but let me give you this advice again
there's no such thing as a private
digital communication
that is not a thing
that is not a thing not a text message
not an email not an encrypted app not
telegram not WhatsApp those are
encrypted
but it doesn't keep them private
because there are other ways that people
can get it besides breaking the
encryption
somebody can just look at your phone or
somebody could look at the phone and who
received it or the person who received
it could just show it to a friend right
so so there's no such thing as private
digital communication the sooner you
realize that the safer you'll be
uh Barry Weiss it was her turn to do the
next Twitter files drop so we got
another tweet thread and more to come
and we learned a little bit more about
Twitter and let's talk about all that
and This falls into the category of
everything you suspected
might actually be true
everything you thought people were doing
to you
they were
just like you thought
let's talk about that
apparently Barry Weiss has discovered
and we all know now that there were two
groups official groups within
Twitter who individually had the ability
to Shadow ban or throttle or decrease
the visibility
of various people and we know that among
those who were
Shadow band
were Charlie Kirk
and Dan bongino
and the libs of tick tock so those are
three that we know for sure that's now
confirmed that they were not imagining
it when they saw that their engagement
dropped through the roof it was exactly
what it what it looked like
now here's my first question
suppose and it seems to be confirmed
suppose it's true that some of those
accounts got totally Shadow banned
how bad will I feel if I wasn't
have you ever thought about that there's
going to be a race now because uh musk
said must said he would uh he would
release a tool that would let you check
your own account status
what happens if I check my account
status and it's just fine and there's no
Shadow Banning on at all do you know how
embarrassed and pissed off I'm going to
be I'm going to be like seriously
you get a band Dan bongino but not me
have you seen what I say
I mean just listen to me for five
minutes if you're if you're gonna ban
Dan Bond you know what has he got that I
don't have why is he better than me all
right sure oh oh you're gonna ban Dan
bongino but not me why
why
I I'm gonna be a little bit jealous of
Dan bongino as I already am because he
does great work
um
I'm gonna be a little bit disappointed
and I'm not even joking
I'm not joking yesterday I realized what
if I find out I was never important
enough to be Shadow banned
I will be crushed
crushed like I desperately want to be on
that list
now here's the here's the problem though
as soon as musk took over
my Twitter account immediately began
responding as though it's not Shadow
banned
so in other words I don't see any
indication that I'm being throttled so I
would imagine that when the Tool is
available I'll check and my account will
look totally clean
that's what I think but that won't tell
me
that won't tell me if they had ever
if they had ever had it banned because
here's what I think
do you believe that that at around the
time
musk took over
do you believe that
um somebody at Twitter went to
individual accounts such as mine and
then made an individual decision to take
the
throttle off of me and then went to the
next person and said all right let's
make the decision on this next one that
feels unlikely
what it feels like and there's no
there's no confirmation to this this is
speculation what it feels like is there
were a whole bunch of us on the list
and that I want to find out if they're
if their so-called tool for for
visibility can do an entire list the
same way in other words can they make
can they make all people on one side
disappear for a little while
because that's the way I would have
built it right wouldn't you build it so
it was a list based as well as
individual of course that would be the
obvious thing you do right you just put
it in a list and then because you want
to be able to treat them all the same
sometimes
yeah
oh uh people on locals
this is the third thing I want you to
remind me of so when I talk to you
privately later
after YouTube is gone
uh I have a Jim Baker story
that I can't tell on YouTube okay
it's not what you think
all right
um here's what else we found out
uh so there were several references to
what Jack Dorsey knew or did
uh do you believe that uh what for those
of you who saw it do you believe that
Barry Weiss and the information she came
up with do you believe it confirms that
Jack Dorsey knew all along and was lying
to the public
how many think he knew all along and he
was lying to the public and that the
information we have confirms that
I see yeses and no's all right have I
mentioned
that private citizens are innocent until
proven guilty
now I'm on record as saying I believe
that he didn't know what was happening
that it was happening clearly but that
the CEO didn't know because the staff
lied about it
that was my speculation now I don't know
that we don't have enough information to
confirm one way or the other
but let me tell you what I think
happened yesterday which is making you
think that it was confirmed
that Jack Dorsey knew what was going on
here's what I think I think we're we're
conflating Concepts
concept number one
did Twitter have a tool a software tool
that would allow them to Shadow ban yes
or no
did they have a tool that could do it if
they wanted to do it yes did we all know
that that was the case
because they obviously had a tool for
getting rid of trolls and Nazis and
people who violated terms of service so
there's no new information no new
information
about the fact that they have the tools
to Shadow ban some people would you
agree that the fact that the tool exists
is known to everybody
now when Jack Dorsey confirmed
that that tool exists was he confirming
that the company does Shadow Banning
because he did confirm that the tool
exists
so what you read was yes that tool
exists
did you read did you read anywhere that
Jack Dorsey knows they used the tool in
an inappropriate way
now stop stop saying he knew that's a
speculation and I understand why you're
speculating it it's a perfectly
reasonable speculation but regardless of
how reasonable it is as a speculation
would you agree that the evidence has
not shown it
the evidence is not shown it
the evidence has shown
that he admitted the tool exists
the evidence has shown that the tool was
used by the employees
and that's what we know
we do know that Twitter's official you
know whatever their official tweeting
account is said unambiguously and said
we do not Shadow ban how could that be
true and not true at the same time
is that possible
is it possible that Twitter
could say and and be honest and true
about it that they don't in Shadow ban
but at the same time they totally do
Shadow ban cannot can both of those be
true
yes I think that's what's going on they
can both be true they seem like
opposites but here's how they can both
be true
hey Twitter what is your official policy
on Twitter on a shadow Banning oh our
official policy is we don't do it
we don't do it at all
okay that's your official policy but now
how do you explain Charlie Kirk Dan
bongino and Libs of tick tock
oh that's not Shadow Banning that was
our opinion that they had created a
danger for our our base and we we always
have a normal process everybody does of
getting rid of dangerous stuff stuff
that stuff that violated our terms of
service well wait a minute wait a minute
Twitter
um even in your internal Communications
you admit it that the libs of tick tock
did not violate any terms of service and
yet in your own writings that we can see
ourselves you banned them so how do you
explain that
and then they say well look at the same
document you're looking at we explained
it in the document we didn't say we said
clearly they did not violate the terms
of service but that they were creating a
dangerous situation in our opinion
and so in order to decrease Danger
we were responsible citizens and we
reduced that source of danger but that's
not Shadow Banning
what are you talking about
that that was good citizens being you
know having a fiduciary responsibility
to their customers seeing what they
believed in their in their honest in
their honest interpretation was a danger
to the citizens the lgbtq community in
particular the trans community
and we didn't want to we didn't want to
be part of increasing the danger
to a
um you know a Target population that is
protected and so oh yes you know it's
true we we did not follow our terms of
service but we did something better than
that
we acted where we thought there was a
risk yeah you could smart people could
disagree and they could say we shouldn't
have done that and you know in
retrospect maybe you're right
but we did it with good intentions and
we didn't break any laws
we did it with good intentions and we
broke no laws
how can you disprove that
you can't you know unless there's a
document somewhere that that proves they
knew exactly what they were doing and it
was just political and we haven't seen
that
no they could they could be telling the
truth that they don't Shadow ban
because they simply have to Define this
other stuff as not Shadow Banning they
simply have to say no we have a
different term for that did we reduce
the visibility of those accounts oh yes
we do that
are you talking about our visibility
reducing oh yeah we totally do that you
should have asked about that
but you asked about Shadow Banning
Shadow Banning would be doing it for
political reasons oh we never do it for
political reasons we do it because there
are some accounts that say dangerous or
untrue things and those things we Target
and it wouldn't matter who they were
right it's just dangerous and untrue
things so we're just sort of doing our
job right
um
I'm going to double down
while also admitting that I could be
wrong
I'm going to double down
on Jack Dorsey didn't know
that they were doing actual Shadow
Banning he thought they were doing you
know visibility reducing of dangerous
stuff
and that but I also Imagine That toward
the end of his uh tenure
I believe he probably had a strong
suspicion of what was going on
and that with that strong suspicion
so here's the funniest part about it so
so Jack is famously sort of a high
awareness
uh kind of an individual
like he's not he's sort of not down in
the the dirty weeds with the rest of us
yeah he's a little bit
you know more of a meditator
seeker of knowledge kind of a guy and
and he seems very non-violent wouldn't
you say
he seems like a non-violent kind of a
guy wouldn't wouldn't wish any violence
on anybody you know higher awareness
kind of guy
I'm imagining how this is playing with
his mind
because if he got screwed by his own
staff as badly as I believe he did
he probably wishes he could go in there
with a machine gun and just just like
kill them all right now that's not fair
I don't want to put any speculate about
other people's internal thoughts but how
how mad would you be
if you didn't know what was going on and
your staff had lied about it and put you
in this position
I would be really really mad and I think
he probably I think he probably either
suspected or knew about it before he
left and I think that's why I think
that's why he's so vocally in favor of
two things all of the documents being
released
now if Jack were guilty
would he ask for all of the documents to
be released
at the very least he knows that there's
no internal document that incriminates
him wouldn't you say at the very least
he must know there's nothing that would
incriminate him
otherwise he wouldn't be calling for it
to be released
you would just be silent about it
and
and he has been a number of times
vocally in favor of uh what musk is
doing including the downsizing of the
company he built
so my if you piece it all together my
speculation is this it's just
speculation
that Jack probably feels like he got
screwed by some people on his his team
and he's happy with musk getting the
Revenge that it was Impractical for him
to get
that's what I think now
let me say this as clearly as possible
if in 10 minutes it turns out I'm
completely wrong and Jack was behind
everything
I will say to you without reservation
well that was wrong
I got that one wrong all right so I'm
not I'm not going to hide it from you
if I'm wrong I'm wrong right it won't be
the end of my life
from wrong I'm wrong
did I miss a Super Chat
I guess I missed it a long time ago
all right what else did we learn here
um
question
is legal for a corporation to lie isn't
it not to Congress but they could lie to
the customers can't they it's legal yeah
I remember it was such a mind blower
when I was a kid to learn that the the
professional wrestling you saw on TV was
not real
because I said to myself well they can't
lie to you on television can they if
it's on television
somebody must have checked to make sure
it's real they wouldn't just say it's
not real
but apparently there's no law against it
and game shows are the same thing did
you know those game shows where you know
somebody wins and somebody loses you
know that they legally they can just rig
those if they want to now I don't think
that they do all the time maybe not most
of the time but but it's completely
legal to rig a game show so you think
you're watching an actual game but you
know it's just rigged it's not even
illegal
years ago this blew my mind do you
remember when uh
was it David Copperfield made a a jet
disappear
does anybody remember that was on live
TV
I don't know if it was live or recorded
might have been live and what they the
way they did it was it was like a real
jet
and they had people uh uh hold hands and
form a circle around it and then they
covered the jet with some kind of a
cloth covering and when they removed the
covering the jet was gone
how do you make an entire jet disappear
obviously it wasn't lifted over the
people
because they would have known that and
it's a whole jet so it's not like there
was like a secret trap door
like there's no trap door that's big
enough for a whole jet
right so how could that how could they
possibly do that trick no it wasn't with
mirrors
no think think more basic
it was just a TV camera trick it wasn't
a magic trick at all the the trick was
it wasn't never a magic trick
the people who were holding hands were
part of the Trek and as soon as the
camera you know looked at one part of
them
the other part the other group just let
their hands out and somebody pulled the
jet out and you know with some kind of a
whatever you used to pull Jess around
and then when the camera you know went
back to where those people were they
were back where they belonged it was
never a magic trick
it it was just a lie that was
entertaining
and because it's entertaining they can
lie
that I think that's roughly the rule if
the point of it is entertainment you're
allowed to lie you you only have to
entertain people
that's it you did what you said you do
I'll entertain you
so once you know that
that helps inform
a lot of what you see
just because just because somebody says
something is true there's no legal
liability there they can say anything
they want
all right
um
Jack Dorsey did tell Charlie Kirk in
2018 that they don't Shadow ban
um Jack Dorsey told me the same thing at
around the same time you know different
words but at the same time now I
believed him
so
could I be wrong sure sure people can be
wrong
but I I still I'm still gonna bet on
that mm-hmm
now what happens to Democrats when it
becomes a point of fact that the system
was rigged
and if if Twitter was rigged the way it
looks like it was rigged that definitely
changed the political landscape
in a dirty trick kind of way but not
necessarily in the illegal way
definitely a dirty drink
so
what happens when their dirty trick
which definitely changed everything
what happens when that's revealed
how do they act do they say oh you got
us this time
well that would be hard to do
right do they say
um no that didn't happen your facts are
wrong because that would be hard
it'd be hard to say the facts are wrong
so here's what I predict
cognitive dissonance
now what is the tell for cognitive
distance have I taught you that
does anybody remember what the tell is
what could be the the so right where
they go so you're saying and then they
say something that's not what you're
saying word salad yeah word salad is the
tell so here is Ted Lou famous uh
Democrat Twitter user who uh is a member
of Congress and you would expect him to
have to say something
you'd have to say something about this
so I'll read you what he tweeted and you
tell me does this make sense or is this
word salad
all right I'll just read it the way he
tweeted it
he goes dear Magda folks
this is Twitter asserting its right to
ban you
or not
or to promote qcat videos over posts by
Barry Weiss or to have quote Twitter
files or to accelerate posts about the
Browns or decelerate posts about kale
Twitter is a business get it
laughs
now
does that have anything to do with
anything yeah that's word salad isn't it
it literally looks like I gotta say
words but I can't say anything that
makes sense so I'll just put these words
together in sentences
right that this I would I would call
this a strong tell
I mean this doesn't even look like he's
lying it looks like it broke his brain
what happens when you realize that the
entire time your side was the bad guys
you know that Ted Lou knows at this
point that the party he belongs to
corrupted the Republic intentionally
and they got caught
now it wasn't illegal apparently but it
was the most unethical immoral weasel
thing that I've seen in a long time
and that's his party and he was an
active member of you know the party that
did that
yeah you even had kale in his word salad
very good he actually used the word kale
in his word salad
talk about a simulation tell there you
go
now I came up with a new word I call
that Twitter explaining
you've heard of mansplaining here's
Twitter explaining and let me do it for
you and you have to do it as if you're
so arrogant you think the person you're
explaining this to somehow is hearing it
for the first time
so let me let me Twitter explain for you
I've got to get in character a little
bit
let me get in character
foreign
let me explain to you maggots
Twitter is a private company do you know
what private means right like not the
government
like you get that does everybody
understand
that Twitter's a private
private company
okay now do you Magnus understand
their free speech applies to the
government
how about that
put that in your pipe yeah no so you
were talking about Twitter a private
company
but but freedom of speech that's about
less about the government
and so I think I've explained that away
for you
and see
and now I'd like to do my impression of
Newt Gingrich
making a complete out of that
guy
right
and now my impression of Newt gigrich
from his appearance on Tucker last I
think it was was it Tucker or Laura I
think Laura
what a big Corporation
colludes with the government
we have a word for that
fascism
that's the literal definition
of fascism
a private company and a government
colluding against the Citizens
that's exactly what happened
and scene
so pick your politicians
Twitter splators or
history professors
I think I'm going to go with a history
Professor on this one
um Do You Believe
that what we've learned about Twitter
which falls into the category of exactly
what you thought was happening
would you agree that that
characterization is fair
that what we know about Twitter is
exactly what you thought was happening
because it looked exactly like that was
happening
okay yes
second question
do you have any question about whether
Google and its YouTube part
and Facebook are doing the same thing is
there any question in your mind that
they're doing the same thing no of
course
uh respecting the law against Free
Speech perpetrated by an extra
government organization and they asked
Twitter to do it
okay
um
yeah
now remember my theme for today
individuals are Presumed Innocent
Jack Dorsey I presume him innocent I
could change my mind later if there's
different information but he's Presumed
Innocent even though there's no legal
he's not in a legal process but just a
you know ethically he's Presumed
Innocent
but is is Google and YouTube and
Facebook are they Presumed Innocent no
no they're presumed guilty and at this
point a reasonable person has to assume
that they are not uh
they're not on the side of America that
they're they are a fascist organization
involved in a fascist process
I I don't think that's hyperbole is it
it's the definition of fascism
is the corporations and the government
working together against the will of
their citizens
we're looking at it we're looking right
at it there's no way to spend that is
there it's just that's what it is
all right so yes you should assume that
YouTube uh hi YouTube
I know you're watching me right now
um so my live streams get uh demonetized
fairly regularly and then you have to
you know ask for it to be undemonetized
and then it does because there was
nothing there to be in the there was
nothing there to get it demonetized it
just gets demonetized based on topic I
think
so uh so they're actually watching me
right now
like literally somebody at YouTube
watches this live stream because we know
that because it gets demonetized so
quickly
and
and so I'm actually in effect talking to
the person
who almost certainly is a fascist
isn't that interesting like for sure
like there's a fascist at YouTube
probably at least one
who's actually watching me right now
and knows for sure
that they're working with the government
of the United States
to you know do you boost some accounts
and they're probably sitting there
thinking
I'm a fascist
that doesn't sound good I'd better look
up the definition of a fascist
but if you do look up the definition of
a fascist and I say this to you
whoever is watching me at YouTube right
now just look it up
I'm not making it up it's when when a
private company and the government
worked together against the interests of
the people that's what it is
so just
I'll let me say this to whoever YouTube
is watching this right now
just think about your life
just ask yourself who you are and who
you want to be
seriously
who do you want to be in this world
do you want to be a fascist
does that feel comfortable
but would you rather be now I don't know
if you're American because you could be
in another country but do you want to be
on the side of reducing legitimate
political speech
is that who you want to be
because if you de-boost my voice you're
not really on the side of the people
any people
and So speaking to you directly
just consider who you are and who you
want to be that's all I'm going to ask
of you I'm not going to ask you to treat
me differently I just want you to be
confident in who you are and who you
want to be
it's all I'll ask and I'll let I'll let
that fall out wherever it is
all right
um
musk was asked on Twitter if there were
any candidates running for office that
we know were Shadow banned
and musk said
yes
and apparently we'll find out
just just hold that in your head for a
moment and and YouTube
whoever is watching this at uh
you know for YouTube
you hold that in your head
that we know for sure that at least at
Twitter
there were candidates legal candidates
for office who were Shadow banned on
Twitter
now of course you're doing it here too
I'm not you personally maybe whoever you
are at YouTube that I'm talking to but
you're part of that process
how does that make you feel
now I get that maybe you preferred a
certain side
yeah I understand that and I respect it
because your opinion is valuable and you
should you should hold your opinion but
just ask yourself if you think you're
improving the country
this way
you know of all the things you could do
to make the world a better place is this
it
is reducing the legitimate speech of uh
40 percent of America
is that
is that where you want to be
does that make you feel good at the end
of the day
all right
I updated updated my hoax list uh it was
18 two days ago and we've already added
uh a couple
so uh now the question of whether
Twitter does
does or does not a shadow ban
is now settled
yes the shadow band they might have
called this something else but there's
no question anymore that happened
um
and I'm just going to go out and just
say this out loud
given what we've seen recently
where the theme of exactly what you you
your worst suspicion was actually true
if we keep seeing that our worst
suspicions are true with one topic after
another
I'm gonna go back and revise my opinions
on Aliens Pizza gate and the 2020
election
I mean right on the edge I I have said
all three of those things are non-valid
topics I've said aliens I don't think
they're real
I don't think they're real I mean I'd
love to be wrong about that I've said
that peace gate from the from the first
from the first minute of basicate I said
no that's not real
that's not real if anybody wants to fact
check that you'll find that I said it
wasn't real from the first second
now
and also the 2020 election I accepted I
accepted because I haven't seen evidence
until today that there was you know an
obvious problem now the Rasmussen poll
that shows that the people who believe
they voted for one person were maybe
surprised at the outcome uh because it
looks like at least from a statistical
polling perspective it looks like there
was a big issue in Arizona
yeah uh so we've got a total collapse of
trust where and by the way I'm not
joking about this
does this sound like a joke I'll say it
again so you know it's not joking
this is so unsettling that everything
you imagined is true
that I literally no joke will reconsider
aliens pizzagate and the 2020 election
three things that I dismissed as you
know not worthy of my attention
all right
yeah don't get me started on Evolution
all right
um Adam Schiff
he said this is a tweet to musk he said
hey Elon under your leadership neo-nazis
homophobes and racists are flocking to
Twitter and spewing his speech
um
and then musk responded that his speech
is like down 30 percent
so literally
shift did what shift does he just made
up something and then presented it as
truth
except musk's credibility is so high
right now
that if musk says in 10 minutes now
that's not true
who are you going to believe
who are you going to believe right musk
of course
so here's what you need to know
um it's always useful to know the teams
one of the one of the ways you can tell
what's really happening in the world is
to identify the teams
to know who plays on what like who does
what role and what on their team and
when the Democrats need somebody to
change a story in the news
and they need to just lie to get it done
there's no other way to do it they
always go to Chef he's their designated
liar that's not a joke
these the designated liar he's the one
that will go on and say something that's
completely not true
whereas your other politicians might
want to shade things or use hyperbole
they might might want to leave out some
context you know basically normal stuff
but Schiff will just make up a fact
he'll just say I saw something that he
didn't see like that's a whole different
level of lying than what you normally
see like when Trump lies he looks like
the you know the A salesperson
and unless you're an idiot you know what
he's doing because he tells you directly
he tells you yeah I use our probability
to get things done but when shift lies
that's a whole different thing he's he's
just making up a story to change
something not in the best Direction
so when you see uh John Brennan Clapper
or Adam Chef
those are the three designated Liars
they use them for that purpose so when
you see them
there you go
um
let's see
what was the story about Harry Reid
oh
Sam Britman
so you know the uh
the the individual Sam bretman who I
don't know exactly how he identifies as
a non-binary but he's got he's got the
shaved head he works in the the nuclear
energy area of or is it weapons nuclear
weapons area of the government
and he was accused of because he was
seen on video of stealing somebody's
expensive bag off a airport carousel
and was later allegedly seen wearing the
clothes from that bag
well it turns out he's alleged to have
done the same crime twice
once at another Airport
and probably they have it on video
and
so so that's happening uh
and you know what the funny thing is
that have you ever lost a bag when
you're traveling
uh you ever have your your luggage
missing does that happen to any of you
because that's happened to me
uh but if it happened recently
I'd be Googling pictures of Sam brentman
just to see if he's wearing my any of my
clothes
like that that's how you find out
uh my the house where I grew up once got
robbed
yeah a burglar came into the house and
robbed a bunch of stuff
and the way the burglar was caught was I
saw him wearing my father's clothes one
day
true story I'm just a kid in the car and
I'm uh yeah we're driving past somebody
who was chopping some wood and like
that's your shirt
he was actually worried my father's
shirt
and so he was caught
anyway
um
what else is going on here
God what a day
uh
did I miss anything
was there any story I missed
now let's put it all together
pull it all together
uh
say I'm a bankman freed
is an American citizen
and Wallace certainly looks like he did
something
suspicious
he is innocent until proven guilty
because he's an American citizen Jack
Dorsey
looks like it's
sketchy situation doesn't it
he's an American citizen
he is innocent
a less proven guilty
but Twitter itself guilty as
Google YouTube guilty as
Congress guilty as
all of them
FDX the company guilty as
right so yes as soon in the election you
let me just say it directly my operating
assumption is that the 2020 election was
rigged
I do not have direct evidence of that
or no I don't have direct proof I do
have evidence
because the the Rasmussen poll and
I'm generalizing from the other the
other experiences
so the the rule that I use all the time
is that if it's possible to get away
with something like you have a good
chance of getting away with something
you shouldn't be doing there's a really
high chance
that the the benefits will be tremendous
either power or money
and there are lots of people involved so
there's always going to be somebody
sketchy if there's lots of people and
you've waited enough time
right so if you have all of those
variables enough time is gone by enough
people are involved the benefit of
cheating is amazing and the odds of
getting away with it are really good
under those conditions
bad things happen 100 of the time
eventually not on day one
but a hundred percent of the time
and and we see that exact situation
with the 2020 election
the 2020 election was a huge benefit if
you could get away with it it's been a
situation for a long time A lot of
people are involved you could probably
get away with it
it's guaranteed
under those conditions it happens every
time
so the only thing I'm not sure of is if
it's happened yet
but it's going to happen if it hasn't
and and certainly that overwhelming
likelihood is that the election was
rigged in some way now I'm not saying I
know that it was rigged enough to change
the result
there's no I don't have that information
there there's certainly an indication of
that
the erasmussen poll but
don't know it as a fact now it's still
true that no court no court has shown
proof that the 2020 election was rigged
it's just that as an informed citizen
who can recognize patterns but more
importantly you can recognize causes
right when I when I say those rules
about you know if there's time and
people and opportunity and the big
upside that's not just a pattern
it's also a pattern that repeats every
time but it's a direct cause and effect
statement where you can say oh there's
the engine that's the exact engine that
drives that that engine was in place and
that can cause these things and it does
it every time
now was any of it illegal I don't know
the Supreme mature to say that
but it certainly happened I mean let me
let me just say this statistically let
me put it in the safest way
if you were a citizen of this country
and you're paying attention
you can do any kind of pattern
recognition and you have any
understanding of how the world works the
reasonable assumption is that the 2020
election was rigged
will I still be on social media tomorrow
what do you think
I think I will
now I'll probably be demonetized I'm
probably getting demonetized right now
am I
YouTube
if I'm being demonetized it means you're
watching me right now
let me find out
let me ask the question
uh
I will ask the one person who knows the
answer to this
demonetis yet
because it's being monitored right now
I'll have an answer probably in half a
minute
what do you think do you think I'm
demonetized or do you think that would
be just too on the nose so like today
will be the day it doesn't happen
there's a good chance that today's the
day it doesn't happen because I made too
much of a big deal about it
but I'll tell you in a moment
now often it will be demonetized as soon
as it ends
so that's another possibility it's
possible it's not demonetized but the
moment I get off it might be demonetized
Jim Baker cooking the books uh the guy
who cooked the books was named Baker
I'm not sure he cooked the books but I
see where you're going with that
all right I have a response
what do you think what do you think do
you think I'm demonetized or not
I am demonetized yeah I'm demonetized
right now
so you can you can watch the fascism
happen right in front of you
this is fascism
you're experiencing it right now and by
the way there's there's no ambiguity
about this
so I have a confirmation
that I'm demonetized by a private
company
who is not doing it for their own
benefit
do you think do you think Google is
doing it because Google's profits would
go better
if I as a well-informed adult citizen of
this country question the sketchiness in
a context where everything is sketchy
do you think that that helped Google
this profit
I don't see how
in fact if it's provocative it helps a
profit the only reason that they would
do it would be why would I be
demonetized
because the government wants it
can you think of another reason
because I can't see any argument
well the cursing would be an excuse
but my my videos in which I curse all
the time are not demonetized so they do
not have a pattern of demonetizing me
only for a cursing
that's that's not a thing because those
are the ones that get reversed
so there's actually somebody at YouTube
presumably who actually listened to my
presentation listen to me talk to them
directly and demonetize me well well
right in front of you like right in
front of you this just happened
everything you believed
was happening
was true
it was all true
now I still have questions about aliens
uh
and peace gate
but
I you know you're what you're watching
me being
victimized by fascism right now like in
real time you're experiencing it
how does that feel how does it feel to
know you're in the fascist country
you don't have to wonder now
interesting
all right well
YouTube I'm going to say bye to you I've
got some more comments for the locals
people who are subscribers so they get
the good stuff and I will talk to you
tomorrow
