good morning everybody
and congratulations for what you've done
for the world so far yeah you woke up
you became part of it and so far you're
on the
on the verge of the best day you've ever
had
what would it take
to put you across that line
into the best day that you've ever had
well
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker chelsea stein the canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
it happens now
go
shudder
quiver
save red save red
okay i'm good now
now did i tell you about my little uh
health mystery i was trying to figure
out why
when i write
i become so tired that i actually fall
asleep instantly
but when i do other things i'm not
necessarily tired
like right now
i don't feel tired at all
but
sometime later today i probably will now
yesterday i did a little experiment and
i recommend this process for all of you
if there's something in your lifestyle
or your diet or your your practice
that's not working
try to isolate it try to isolate it so
yesterday i actually
very methodically
tried to see what it is that wakes me up
about going to starbucks because when i
go to starbucks i can sit there and
write
as long as i want i'm not even a little
bit tired i was trying to figure out is
it the environment
the temperature the people around or is
it just the caffeine
now i couldn't understand it would be
the caffeine
because i drink coffee continuously
is there some magic about starbucks
coffee so this is what i was testing
so the first thing i did was i tested
how i felt before i went
so it was around noon
and i was so tired
i could barely walk
now that's not hyperbole
i mean walking across the flat surface
in my house
was a challenge it was actually hard to
the point where i really didn't even
want to be standing i wanted to sit down
and so that's how tired i was this was
not normal tired
this is not tired like oh i didn't get
sleep last night
right because i did it on a day when i
had plenty of sleep so i eliminated lack
of sleep because it was a day i
you know i had plenty of sleep
so it wasn't lack of sleep
and i was exhausted
so i thought well maybe it's diet or
something like that so i go to starbucks
and the first thing i do is since you're
waiting for your your beverage i wanted
to see how awake i was
just sitting at a table
because i thought maybe it's the
environment
and i did feel in fact a little bit more
awake
maybe a 20 difference it was noticeable
but just just being in an environment
with more action and stuff
but also the temperature i estimate was
probably 68 degrees
now
if you're in a place that has a
heat wave going on as i am
you've probably had your house at 75 or
above for a while now
so when you go from 75 to it felt like
68 it might have been not 68
but it was cold
it was actually cold in there
and it wasn't too cold that i had to
leave or get a jacket but it was like
right on the edge right
so
could be the temperature right so then
my drink comes it's
an icy
drink with a
shot of coffee in it
and i'm drinking my drink and i'm i only
have like this much
of a large thing
and already instantly i could feel a
difference
by the time i was done with my one drink
and i had a little banana bread just so
i had something else with me
by the time i was done i was wide awake
and i could write infinitely and in fact
it was so much fun to write because it
was so easy i wanted to stay for another
hour but you know i don't like to stay
at the starbucks for two hours
i feel like i'm taking up a chair
so but i stayed there for an hour
so here's the mystery i eliminated lack
of sleep that's not what the problem was
i eliminated and by the way i was going
to go to the gym before i went to
starbucks but i couldn't
i couldn't
i just i just couldn't do it
uh but after the starbucks i was like oh
i could totally i went to the gym and
not only did i have a good workout
it was a really good one it was like one
of the best
so i went from literally and again this
is not hyperbole it was difficult to
walk on
a flat surface
it was too much energy i couldn't handle
it
to having a starbucks experience and
being able to go to the gym and do
a vigorous workout
and then wide awake all night
not not a problem for the rest of the
day got all kinds of stuff done
so you tell me what happened
i don't understand this and i'm sure i
can reproduce this by the way because
it's similar enough to other experiences
it appears
that it's actually the drink
it's the drink
so there's something in that drink
that is completely unlike the literally
starbucks coffee that i drink all day
this is starbucks
the size of this mug
look at the size of the mug
and then
right and then then double this because
i drink about two of these before noon
and it doesn't make any difference to my
energy level none
like well i mean i'm sure would be
better than if i didn't do it
but i couldn't even walk
with just regular coffee
but as soon as i had that starbucks
drink i went to the gym
fine everything was fine
what do you think it is
i think it's 20 ambiance and temperature
and 80 caffeine
but or 80 to drink
but maybe it's the sugar but here's the
thing i can i could do sugary treats at
home and it wouldn't make any difference
so here's the next thing i'm going to
test
next thing i'll test is i'll drive there
i'll get the drink and i'll drive
directly home because it's only five
minutes away
and then i'll do the i'll do the
starbucks drink at home and see if i
stay awake
all right so i'm isolating you know
variables all right so the the the
larger point of this was not about me in
my book well i guess this is about me
too
in my book i had a fail of almost
everything and still went big one of the
big tips i give
is that you should experiment with your
own
health
and you should always do it you should
be in a continuous never stop
long-term experiment
to say okay if i eat peanuts
does it make me less hungry
because allegedly they do
i've tried that and it works
eating peanuts does make you less hungry
so every time you have a hypothesis
try to isolate all the other variables
and really see if it makes a difference
because whatever this is
this is a major major deal in my
happiness and in life
so i'm just isolating it i'll figure it
out
um
i saw a funny tweet by james and
newberry a user on just a twitter user
and he said that somewhere around 25
years ago i got my first tech job
we were on a jihad to connect everyone
on the internet our thinking was that if
every person had access to the entire
sum of human knowledge then humanity
would be smarter
his last sentence is
in hindsight we were so naive
[Laughter]
to
talk about the greatest fail of all time
hey
if i work really hard
weekends and nights
i can get everybody connected to the
internet
and then we'll all be smarter
[Laughter]
well
well
here's what they did not see coming
if you empower the dumbest among us to
have an equal voice
that's not going to work out
and that's what happened
so in the old pre pre-internet days
what did it take for somebody to get
noticed
before the internet the internet what
did you have to do
to rise high enough that you could be in
say a newspaper or give a speech
you had to do a lot
you probably had to be really educated
and accomplished you probably had to be
rich other people had to think you had
some substance
right
but now all you need is a twitter
account
and say some provocative things and you
get followers
and you can be as dumb as you want
so
i think when we enabled the dumbest
among us
to
to be full participants in the
intellectual
discourse
maybe we should have seen that problem
coming
maybe we could have anticipated that one
now what is the antidote to that
the antidote
what is the antidote to too many dumb
people on the internet
what is it
it's this
okay robert um
there's a good hypothesis
on youtube fellatio
and i'm gonna take that as a solid
number two solution
really for just about everything
in fact
you know i'm no doctor so don't take
this as medical advice
but
there are very few problems you can't
solve with fellatio
i'm talking about being on the receiving
end here
if you're on the giving end that doesn't
solve as many problems but it can also
solve problems can also solve problems
so really there's not much you can't do
i think i was talking about something
else though oh so the solution to all
the dumb people on the internet is this
what you're doing right now
which is
there are some people who can help you
think about stuff better
because they spend time in that field
i believe i'm one of those people
that
i can help you figure out what's true
and what's not
now i think somebody like mike ceravich
is one of those people
meaning that he's more clever than you
are
at figuring out what's true and what's
not so if you want to if you want to
figure out you know how to avoid all the
dumbest people on the internet
find some people who have spent some
time and develop some skill
to know what's true doesn't mean it'll
always be right i mean you you've
certainly seen me be wrong enough
but
yeah i just use cernovich as my
universal example for just about
everything ben shapiro another excellent
example
that here's let me give ben shapiro a
compliment by the way i've been meaning
to do this
but
um you know when you're watching the the
queen go 70 years without making an
error which really is remarkable quite
remarkable um then you start asking
yourself if there's like anybody else
you know who's going a long time without
making an error
um and
so ben shapiro
says a lot of stuff and i don't think
he's wrong very often is he
he probably has the highest ratio of
saying stuff in public
without being wrong
of just about anybody you can imagine
so i mean that's that's that's worth a
lot isn't it and also i don't think that
ben shapiro has fallen for
um
any conspiracy theories
i can't think of one can you
has he has he actually managed to surf
the highest level of
right-leaning politics without buying
into any any conspiracy theories because
i don't think so i don't think he's
bought into one
that i'm aware of
right
no he didn't i don't think he bought
into the fine people hoax
i don't think that happened
all right
is wrong about blackrock acquiring homes
wrong about the facts or wrong about the
importance of it so i don't know that
issue anyway
you know the the other thing
um
well
i'm going to switch paths here for a
minute
ken olin you might know him as an actor
he retweeted
a woman who was saying that she didn't
understand his little viral video of a
woman explaining that if donald trump is
so awesome
and he is not a criminal
why can't he get the top lawyers to
defend him
what do you think at that point
so this is a democrat obviously
saying if donald trump is so good just
like you think why can't he get the best
lawyers to defend him she says what do
you think of that
why do you think that
trump can't get the best lawyers
according to one person
well number one
have you heard of alan dershowitz
like alan dershowitz the the number one
guy you'd probably want on your side if
you had a legal problem
so he does have
the best lawyer in the world
you know or at least certainly in the
top .001
so there's that but that's just one and
dershowitz is a special case
dershowitz is braver than other people
that's that's just a fact
he is just publicly braver than other
lawyers
so
think about the
uh yeah heartbeat doing a great job we
here
army to dylan
yeah but
so first of all i would uh question the
statement that he's not getting good
representation
that does not seem to be the case
i think it's more to the point that
trump
embraces people who embrace him
i think that's basically explains
everything about it but it's not like he
doesn't have also high quality attorneys
right
but here's what the democrats don't
quite understand
the reason trump can't get good help
is democrats
i'm not wrong right the reason nobody
wants to work with trump
is because of what democrats say about
trump
which is most of it's untrue
so
isn't the problem not trump the problem
is that democrats are broken
because if they said accurate fair
things about trump then people would say
oh i totally disagree with maybe
trump's opinion on whatever
but i wouldn't have any problem
representing him
as long as everybody's being reasonable
he's just a reasonable person in a
reasonable world
but when they paid him out to be the you
know the next hitler who the hell is
going to represent that
it doesn't even matter what the lawyer
believes
if they believe that other people will
destroy their lives for being associated
but
i guess the amazing part here is
that the person who made the video
saying why don't people want to you know
work with or represent trump and the
person who tweeted it
actually don't understand that they're
the problem
isn't that weird
they actually don't understand that they
are the problem and the actual tweet
that i'm talking about is the problem
that's the reason that they don't work
with them it's you
not you
but you that i'm talking about
so the the i i guess uh it's just a
stunning lack of awareness a stunning
lack of awareness and it's so common
um
so the news got a little uh boring
recently that's why we have a double
whiteboard i'll give you some updates
here in a minute
um a weird thing happened with the
dilbert comic online
it got
a whole bunch of the text and the first
panel got deleted before it got
published
i don't know why
and it's not even it doesn't seem
censored
because the part that got deleted
doesn't have any special importance so i
think it happened in the production of
it somehow somebody said the newspapers
have a correct version but the online is
wrong
i don't know what's up with that but
if you like to collect things maybe i'll
make an nft out of it
there was a cnn article talking about
ted cruz's complicated relationship with
trump
and let me tell you this was an amazing
article
all right just hold this in your head at
the same time
it was on cnn
so cnn is the source
it was their opinion
and it was about trump and ted cruz
here's the amazing part
it was objective
it was objective
now it wasn't all positive
i'm not saying that you know it said it
talked about trump insulting cruz's wife
and
and all that
but nothing in the article
was stupid
they just reported the news
and i kept reading the article waiting
for the part where it would say but of
course you know trump is a fascist
monster or something like that
it wasn't there
it was actually a story about two
republicans
that actually just talked about the
interesting news
around them and that was it
and i i read the whole article looking
for
the the cnn spin where you know he's the
devil it wasn't there it was just an
article about two republicans
so if you don't think that the
new head of cnn is serious
about pivoting to the middle
i mean it be serious it's happening
well the news on ukraine
seems to be all
uh pointing in one direction suddenly
doesn't mean it's true
doesn't mean it's true
because we're still in the fog of war we
don't really know what's happening in
ukraine and russia
but
it is notable
that even the russians are not
disagreeing with the coverage at the
moment and the coverage is saying that
the ukrainians are making major advances
against the positions of the russians so
they've gone 30 miles across the
previous line they've encircled well let
me go to the white board and give you an
update
i know it can be confusing because a lot
of people are not familiar with the area
so
this map will explain the entire
situation
so
uh what you've got is you've got the
ukrainian forces that are surrounding
the uh blakkava karba region
but they're also making inroads in the
collapse of kappa and the akba
kinzometer the sasaki
is a holding tight but there are a lot
of assets being lost in the coupons
and ludowski and pumpkin
so but this area in the just surrounding
the laksa makaba
is a
sustaining heavy fire but we do hear
that there there's a retreat in the uh
in the
in
uh but the key and peel are
are
making inroads as well
so
i think that pretty much summed it up
now there is one thing that is uh
conspicuously missing
in this story
did you see anything missing
yes
airplanes
there don't appear to be any airplanes
in the story
what the hell is going on
don't you expect some jets
it's a war
i don't know what's going on
but there's so there's something very
unexplained
and the unexplained part is where's the
the russian air force
apparently it's not there
the russian air force apparent it just
doesn't seem to be part of the war
why
why
now one one theory is that the
ukrainians took delivery of some
advanced anti-aircraft
assets from
nato countries
that could be the whole that might be
the whole uh
explanation it could be that the new
anti-aircraft is so good
that russia's would just be throwing
away jets in other words they wouldn't
gain enough
by putting a jet up there versus the
odds of losing it
now it may also be true that the
ukrainians had great success destroying
weapons depots and resupply lines
because that's the reporting don't know
if anything's true
remember everything out of this region
is suspect
and fog of war
but even the russians are not claiming
they're holding tight so the reporting
is
uh russians are retreating they're
abandoning the equipment
the ukrainians are basically taking over
cities within a fight
and
it's starting to look like the entire
russian army is collapsing
did you see that coming
now
could be a trick could be a trick i mean
maybe maybe russia is like baiting in
the you know trying to get the ukrainian
military in there
but one report said that's what the
ukrainians did
to the russian army
the ukrainians allegedly again who knows
what to believe but allegedly they
actually baited the best russian forces
into a kill box and then started
degrading them and once they had
degraded the best russian forces
then they mounted the invasion and there
was nothing to stop them
that's what it looks like that doesn't
mean that's true remember everything
about this
is highly suspect
but here's the question i wonder about
you know that ukraine
was smart enough and skilled enough
especially zelinski
to know that persuasion is
maybe the most important part of the war
so zelensky's persuasion of the west how
would you rank it
was zielinski's persuasion skill
of his allies
give me a give me a grade what do you
think it was
i see an a plus
zelinski's persuasion skill i see a c
a plus a solid
nine and a ten b minus
all right i think he's closer to an a or
an a plus
now let me ask you this
do you think there's someone who's
capable
of that level of persuasion and by the
way this would be the very best in the
world
you know in my opinion what zelinski has
done is winston churchill level
persuasion
right
now you can say what you want to say
about him if you don't like him for
other reasons but persuasion wise
he has the goods
now here's my question
do you think that his persuasion only
works that powerfully with his own
allies
because this might be the variable that
everybody's missing
ukraine has quite intentionally been
running a
discouragement campaign against the
russian soldiers
trying to simply discourage them
from being interested in fighting
i think they may have succeeded
they may have succeeded because it's
hard for me to understand
why russia is not putting up a better
fight
that's sort of
unless it's a trap
and that would be a stretch
unless it's a trap it looks like their
will to fight has been broken
that's what it looks like now again pure
speculation
we're way too far away and
under-informed to know what's happening
but that's what it looks like it looks
like he broke their will
what do you think
is that hypothesis does it at least
match the facts that we can discern
it looks like it doesn't
now the bigger story of course is the
modern weapons and the fighting
the fighting skill and will of the
ukrainian military which apparently is
freaking awesome as far as we can tell
so i i think the big story is going to
be the persuasion game
uh you remember the ukrainians were
taking pictures of the captured russian
soldiers
and they would find their social media
and they would send messages back to
their parents and stuff
they knew that it would take a while for
that persuasion to work
because they were doing it retail like
one one person at a time here's a
picture to your mother
here's a note to your mom
maybe it worked
we'll see
amazingly the russian police arrested
five
government officials they weren't very
high level but
they had
these five officials
said that uh putin should be charged
with treason for his uh
his launching of the war in ukraine
now those five people are probably going
to be dead pretty soon but there were
five people who had successful lives in
russia
who just gave their lives
to protest putin
they just gave their lives
and they knew it
they knew it when they did it
so something's happening
something's happening over there
all right
um yesterday there was some news that
bannon said there were going to be that
there were 35 raids against trump
supporters did you see that news
yesterday
and i tweeted that that looked like
 to me
that there's probably something
happening
but it's not going to match that
description
and then we woke up this morning
and it's up to 50 up to 50 people
but they were not rated per se they were
subpoenaed
so it's more of a paperwork thing so so
it's not like the fbi went into 35 homes
there were
35 or 50 people
who got some legal paperwork saying hey
we'd like to see your documents
now it's still bad
unless unless i'm not excusing it
it just did not involve home invasions
apparently
which is what i imagined when i first
saw it i said that's two on the nose
35 raids i'm not believing it
how many of you how many of you saw the
news that there were 35 raids
which would suggest actually going into
homes how many thought that actually
happened when you saw that bannon said
it happened
how many of you believed it was true
when you read it
because
because you should have said to yourself
it's too on the nose
i mean i teach you that all the time
right
i couldn't say anything more often than
i say that
that was so on the nose
that you should have seen that one
immediately now it doesn't mean nothing
happened just that the way it was
described that was a little too on the
nose
all right so it looks like it didn't
happen
um
let's uh talk about the
imaginary civil war
so eric swalwell
tweeted this he says no matter what
do not lose sight of the fact that
they're more of us than there are of
them
hashtag strength in numbers now i assume
he means the more of us meaning you know
good people like democrats as opposed to
bad people like mega extremists
um
okay
so let me give you an update on the
imaginary civil war
so the the two sides it looks like the
two sides have been formed
on one side we have the
people who want to vote but can't get id
there are quite a few of them so this is
a pretty big force
then there are the people on the left
who want to be uniters and not dividers
so they're they're part of the imaginary
army
and then very importantly the army of
the dead
voters dead voters
so at the army of the dead voters the
people who want to vote but can't get id
and the people on the left who want to
unite
that's one side of the imaginary
war but on the other side they've got
some stiff competition
it's going to be a tough because
here you have the magnafascists
those are the people who believe in the
constitution
but yet somehow are also fascists
i don't know
some would say that that can't exist
it's an imaginary category
because how could you be
a mega lover of a constitution
and a fascist
doesn't make sense in your mind
but
for the imaginary civil war it's good
enough
so you've got those then you've got the
people on january 6 who who believed
that they would actually take over the
country
without using weapons
so you got those
but
if i were going to handicap this war and
figure out who's going to win
it looks like the imaginary people on
the right have an advantage because they
also have the nuclear plans
that they captured from the mar-a-lago
boxes
so if you've got imaginary nuclear plans
and the imaginary insurrections have
that and they bind together with the
non-existent maga fascists you have an
amazing fighting force
that i think
i think will be even stronger
than the people who want to vote but
can't get id the uniters on the left and
the army of the dead
voters
and obscene
all right
in other news
elon musk continues to solve problems
that other people just talk about
so apparently he's proposing building a
major
lithium refinery facility in the gulf of
texas
in other words trying to
decouple from china
and make sure that we can make batteries
with domestic
stuff
so that's good
good for him
all right and
correct me if i'm wrong
but it's only half an hour into our live
stream if it's already the best thing
you've ever seen in your life
i know how do i do it
it's amazing
all right
i would like to remind you
of some of the weirdest
predictions that i've made
which
i went to look at and are not even here
how about here
there we go
so here here are some predictions i made
which is not to say all my predictions
were right
right they were not all right but here
are the weirdest ones
you ready for this the weirdest
predictions i made that turned out to be
right
the the famous one of course i predicted
that trump would win in 2016.
uh but i also predicted remember the las
vegas shooter
and
isis claimed credit
for that
and after isis claimed credit
i said it's not isis
do you remember that
now how often does isis claim credit for
something and it's not really isis it's
pretty rare
so i even after isis claimed credit i
said it's not isis and of course it
wasn't wasn't isis
when fauci first said that masks
wouldn't make any difference now i'm not
going to argue about whether masks work
that's not the that's not the topic the
question is just lying
i was the only person in the country i
believe who said he's lying he's
obviously lying
and then he admitted later he was lying
to
protect the supply of masks
i don't think anybody else in the
country thought he was lying
or at least said it i believe i'm the
only person in the country who said it
immediately that's a lie he's obviously
lying
what about that secret sonic weapon that
was injuring the
people in the embassies
i said as soon as that story broke
you will never find a secret sonic
weapon you will never find a secret
sonic weapon
so far
no they didn't find any secret sonic
weapon no they didn't
i also said that ukraine would be too
hard for russia to conquer because of
modern weaponry
literally the only person who got that
right
apparently
apparently i'm the only person in the
world who got that military prediction
right
my weirdest one that i got wrong was
that kamala would be the toughest
competition for trump in the past
election
and
and here's the weird part even after she
dropped out of the primaries i kept my
prediction that she would she would be
his biggest competition
and then she ended up weirdly being
president for two hours while biden was
under anesthetic or something
now that prediction was 100 wrong
but it's the weirdest wrong prediction
of all time you couldn't get be more
right while being completely wrong
and then of course my prediction that
republicans would be hunted
if
biden got elected
now some say but scott you also said
that if biden got elected there'd be a
good chance you'd be dead in here
you don't know if that was true or true
or false you just because if you make a
prediction based on the odds
and it doesn't happen it doesn't mean
you were wrong
because you said the odds if i say
there's a three to one chance of
something happening and it doesn't
happen i'm not wrong
it just means i estimate the odds it
doesn't mean i predict it
oh that people uh do have
no there there are definitely people who
have um
actual physical medical problems who are
part of the embassy thing
but the thing that makes it a mass
hysteria probably
is that some number of people have
problems that you would find if you did
an mri if you just took 100 people
and did an mri
you'd find out i don't know
10 of them had some health problem you
didn't know about
and some of that would be in their
brains
so i think some of it is just if you're
looking for it you're gonna find it
so i think it's that
anyway those are some pretty weird
predictions i think i had some other
ones that are equally weird
oh somebody's speculating that kamala
harris may have fried her brain with
drugs
you know that's not a bad that's not a
bad hypothesis i was going to reject
that right out of
hand but when i watch kamala harris
talking as vice president i can't
understand how she ever won an election
it's like something changed because when
i originally predicted she'd be the
hardest to be is because i'd watched her
speak in public
and she seemed very good speaking in
public but she's clearly not
so something
i'm not going to speculate that that's
what happened but it looks like
well there's a mystery here i'll just
say
that's funny um
she lost her writers i don't know
because when she was doing the uh
interrogating people in congress
she didn't have writers for that she did
great
yeah i don't know
i i don't know how she passed the bar
she does not look like she would be
capable of
high level
intellectual anything
based on her performance
you think she's overwhelmed and brain
fogged
i don't know
um
all right well i think that i don't have
anything else to talk about as i warned
you
the democrats would not want to compete
with
the queen's news because
they don't want to compete because they
can't get any attention so any dirty
tricks and fake news is probably going
to have to wait until the queen's stuff
is done
adam t said this too
all right
that's all for me and i'm going to
say goodbye to youtube and i'll talk to
the locals people a little bit more bye
for now
