hey everybody
come on in here it's time for coffee
with scott adams
today will be the
i'll tell you it's been a it's been a
tough morning
didn't even have my microphone that's
better
question are you seeing me in sideways
orientation
or is this another technical problem
i'll bet i'm sideways aren't i can
somebody tell me if you're seeing me
sideways or right side up
no okay so uh
most of this trip as i tweeted earlier
uh because you go to a new environment
and there are all these controls and
user interfaces and buttons you have to
learn
i swear half of my life is just figuring
out new buttons
for example the toilet here has this
two-part button
where you know depending on your
business you push one button versus the
other
and it has this unique design which is
sometimes the button flushes the toilet
and when i say sometimes i mean one
times out of three
and the other times you can jam it as
much as you want nothing happens
now you're thinking to yourself it's
because the bowl has filled or the
the tank is filled nope
has nothing to do with that or when you
do it
it's just that it only works one time at
a
three one time and a five and my entire
environment is filled with that
i'm using a i'm using periscope right
now
the comments are coming streaming
sideways
so i can't read them very well i'll try
but they're sideways
instead of the way they normally go why
i don't know how many times if i use
periscope
a billion times but this time it doesn't
work
oh here's what i could have been doing
instead of periscope i could have gone
to youtube
and live stream on there now you
probably know that i've been live
streaming on
uh on youtube for months and months and
months
every single day so if you were to say
to yourself
does that guy know how to live stream on
youtube
does he know what button to push to make
youtube
happen and live stream yes he does
because he does it every single day
except for reasons i don't quite
understand
those buttons don't exist anymore and i
honestly don't know why
i open up youtube just like always
look at the app look at it on a browser
look at it on a different browser
and that little button that i've been
pushing for months to go live
live stream it's not there
i don't know where it is now you say to
yourself
i'll bet you could solve that scott you
know you
operate in a complicated world i mean
you can figure out where that button is
and why it's not there
might have something to do with being in
another country i don't know
that does make some of the apps not work
but here's the thing
if that were my only interface problem
yeah i could probably take half a day
and google it and figure it out
but i'm surrounded by these everything
i've touched
has become a technical problem today
everything
every button every every piece of
software
every device i've got several electronic
devices
so we've reached the point in
civilization where a full
50 of our time in any given day can be
given up to fixing your printer
reloading your software or figuring out
why the car doesn't do what it used to
do before
so there's your world all right let's
talk about the news
in california it's reported that the
government of california will not tell
its citizens
what kind of formulas and statistics and
algorithm i guess they use for deciding
what to do about coronavirus
and the reason they're not telling the
public it's reported is
and i quote state health officials said
they rely on a very complex set of
measurements
that would confuse and potentially
mislead the public
if they were made public that's right
so in california my state i'm not
allowed to see
what kinds of information that is used
to determine my entire life
you know what happens with the
coronavirus
isn't that a problem now i understand
the
point that it's complicated people
wouldn't understand they would take it
wrong it would cause some problems
but is that a problem with the people
is that a flaw in the public because to
me it looks like a flaw in
how they're measuring things if you're
if you're doing big public policy like
this
and you haven't simplified what it is
you're measuring
and therefore managing too you're doing
it wrong
so as soon as somebody says yes we're
managing to a complex
stop it's already wrong you don't need
to hear what even
the re the s the the rest of the
sentences
let me say that better without
butchering it
if a politician says to you we're we're
going to make decisions based on a very
complex
stop you don't make decisions about
public policy based on complexity
because if you do the public won't
understand it they won't buy into it it
won't work
so you need to simplify it somehow even
at the risk of being less
accurate simplicity is really really
important
so there must be some way they could
simplify their decision making down to
you know if i don't know school children
or people over
65 have x infections or something like
that
now it would be deeply imperfect but
probably better than what they're doing
now
you know you could be eighty percent
imperfect and it might be better than
the current situation which is not
telling the public why they're doing
what they're doing
plus we're not so smart that being
really complicated in our formulas is
going to give us a better result we just
don't know
we don't know what works and what
doesn't so being complicated about it
that might be adding complexity to the
unknown which is really just
getting you further from anything useful
so simplify simplify that's my advice
um seattle police have made a startling
decision
this surprised me i think you'll be
pretty surprised too
so the the seattle police are going to
do this thing called uh
cracking down on crime you've heard a
crime that's when do
people do things that are against the
law such as rioting and
breaking windows and businesses and
vandalizing and stuff
and up until now um i didn't know this
but
apparently they were just spectating so
the police were more of a spectating
situation
but now they've decided they're going to
crack down on riders who damage
businesses
and i'm thinking to myself now i would
like to have been in the brainstorming
meeting for that
right wouldn't you like to have been in
the brainstorming meeting
okay your comments are going sideways
but i can see that a lot of them have
the word
s.i.p in them and i think that means
that you're telling me it's time for the
simultaneous set
and i believe it is if you'd like to
enjoy it to its full potential
all you need is a copper mug of glass
canteen
jealous no
a thing more things that liquids will go
into without spilling
there are several of them with different
names and blah blah blah the dopamine
of the day it's the best part of the day
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
simultaneous up
go
are you ever frankly amazed that i can't
remember
the thing that i say literally every day
you shouldn't be because it's actually
completely normal
you know within the landscape of my
brain
one of the things that christine and i
love talking about
is the differences between what she can
do and what i can do
things her brain can do that mine can't
she can she can memorize
you know beethoven's moonlight sonata
and three acts which has how many notes
i don't know a lot of notes thousands
and thousands of notes
in a specific order and she can memorize
that
i can't memorize the thing i do every
day it's just a few sentences
so different brains anyway
the china has decided to ban the trump
administration
from our ex-members of the trump
administration from ever
entering china to which i say to myself
is it getting a little bit too obvious
that china and the democrats are
sort of you know hand-in-glove
now you can say to yourself but scott
that's not then it's not they're not
working together
they just both don't like the same thing
there's nothing unusual about that
but every time we see a situation where
the democrats and china are on the same
page
there should be a little flag that goes
up in your brain that says
huh maybe ought to look into that a
little bit more
so uh honestly
i think there's an inevitability to
china's
control of our information and our
and our government i think because it
goes like this whoever has the most
money wins
just in general eventually just because
of the sheer
size of china if they just grow at some
normal rate
and the united states grows at some
normal rate
china's going to be bigger and it won't
take long because they got more people
so
that's all it takes when they have
immensely more money than anybody else
they can start bribing like crazy
and they can send millions of people to
embed themselves in other in other
governments and other countries
until eventually they have full control
of everything so they're really only
i guess three things you'd need for
china to control
everything uh immense amount of money
check
you know they they have immense already
but even more coming
um will are they willing to send
millions
of people into undercover
you know jobs around the country or
around the world
yes we already see them doing that and
then third they have to be willing
to do it they have to think it's a good
idea and a high priority and just
willing to do it
and they are so if you take those things
what's going to stop them from
eventually having a at least a financial
direct or indirect control over
everybody
take me i'm you know giant critic
of china but even i have business that
goes through china indirectly not my own
personal business but if you look at my
publishers or my
you know people i work with they have
china business so
pretty much everybody's got something to
lose
or will have something to lose if they
speak out against
china that's where we're heading where
you won't be able to criticize china
because they'll have too many controls
in too many places
what would it take for china to control
cnn
what would that take i think all it
would take is to open up their market
and say yeah you can you can have some
news here but
after you've got a nice profit there and
your stockholders like it
we're going to say you know maybe you
can't stay here
if you keep talking the way you're
talking about that story
so china has a whole bunch of different
ways
to directly and indirectly apply
financial pressure
or incentives to people so i don't
really know
how they could ever avoid having full
control of everything
just by money without firing a single
shot i don't know whatever
what would stop that i can't think of
anything the only thing that would stop
it is what trump was doing which was
looking to decouple our business it
looks like biden is probably going to
reverse that
i think and therefore we will have no
plan
compared to china's long-term strategic
plan which is
largely guaranteed to work in the long
run
the only part you don't know is how long
it takes you don't have to wonder
if it happens it's how long it takes
i say the same thing about the integrity
of our election system
and i'll say it about every other
country any country that has
an election system and enough openness
that
you know people can get in and mess with
it if they if they had a reason to
eventually i would think any voting
system would be
compromised by the intelligence agencies
of either their own country so that the
intelligence agencies could have more
power
or by an outside force and again it's
exactly the same question
it's not if it's going to happen it's
guaranteed
it's just when has it happened already
or is it
in our future that's the part we don't
know but it has to happen there's no
there's no way around it
in the long run um of course there could
be surprises right so
a straight line prediction of anything
is always is always the worst
prediction so when i say it has to
happen
that assumes nothing's different between
now and whenever it might happen
but things change so there could be lots
of things that
that would get you off track there all
right um
we're seeing calls for fox news to be
banned
from the white house now this of course
would be the mirror story for
trump banning cnn for a while i don't
know how long that lasted
but um the the call for banning fox news
you knew that was coming but of course
the stories that talk about it will give
examples of
of the things they say fox news got
wrong and riled people up and
blah blah what they don't talk about in
the same story
is how many things cnn got wrong
and how many things msnbc got wrong
because the claim is
the fox news is a special brand
of wrong news i don't see it
i don't see it at all the criticisms
that you know they leveled sort of
depend on
magical thinking which is
let's say they know that fox news is
wrong about some things
that you couldn't know they're wrong
about they might be wrong
but you couldn't know they're wrong so
i'm not going to get into the specifics
of that
because i don't want to get kicked off
of social media
but um you know
it's amazing that in my opinion
i think it's true i don't want to be a
mind reader
but i believe it's true based on
observation
see what you think about this that the
people who are saying that fox news
should be banned from the white house
and
you know taken off the air or whatever
else they're saying
i think they actually believe that cnn
is giving them real news
don't you think i don't think that they
they think that cnn
is you know biased propaganda but it's
on their side
so that's okay i don't think they think
that
i think they're completely unaware that
all of the news is the same
they're just differences on topics
but there's no such thing as one of the
news that's nailing all the stories
correctly
that doesn't exist in any world but i
think they think it does
and i'm going to get to that point in a
little bit
we'll say more about that in a bit all
right
um i was also reading on cnn which i
read for entertainment not news
an opinion piece in which somebody smart
was on the air saying
and this is a direct quote from cnn
quote
and this is an opinion person not a news
person uh
who they had it was an opinion person
that they had on
on to talk about it and this person said
it's it doesn't matter who it is it's
the point that matters
it's been very clear from the data that
states that have
implemented strong mass policies have a
slower increase in the number of cases
or even a decrease but it's not mask
alone
says this person it's masked in
combination with other measures such as
measures such as distancing and improved
ventilation and hand washing etc
now i don't know if that's true
or untrue it's my personal opinion based
not on science the masks probably work
and why i say probably 90 percent
you know nothing's 100 these days but
i'd say
just my personal opinion not an expert
not a doctor and not in not even looking
at the studies
just the fact that if if a mask
slows down the spread from your mouth
and that's the problem
it just makes sense it probably works
and
social distancing how do you get
something from somebody you're not
near right so it makes sense to me that
these things work
but why have i never seen
a reliable study or set of studies
that say that doesn't that seem missing
is it because of my news sources because
the
the gentleman who made this claim didn't
point to a source
how many peop how many people believe
that there
that this is a true statement that
science has looked at the data
and they're quite quite certain based on
what they've seen
in a scientific logical data-driven
sense
that masks work where is that data
now again i believe they do work i think
you should wear your mask
until there's you know some some proof
that they don't work and we don't have
that
but where is the evidence that they do
work
doesn't that feel sort of suspiciously
missing
it's just the most obvious thing right
if wearing masks is so important
why doesn't cnn and anybody who wants us
to wear masks
point us to the data and say look we're
not making this
up you know this is not us just trying
to guess
on science we're looking at actual
studies
here here are the studies you can look
at them yourself you
take your skeptics in look at them and
you can see that these masks work
now democrats believe these studies
exist
i think they might i'm not saying they
don't
but why don't i know that at this point
yeah and i like to use myself as sort of
a you know canary in the gold mine
or the in the coal mine situation
which is i follow the news
pretty closely compared to the average
citizen
pretty closely i follow it on the left i
fall in the right
every single day i check both cnn and
fox and compare their stories every day
as part of what i do here and i don't
know
where i would look to find the
definitive
um you know study or studies
that confirm that masks are lowering
infections
now i have seen lots of studies of
laboratory tests
if you've if you've seen a laboratory
test where they say a mask
doesn't have the the density to stop the
virus because the virus will pass
through
do you know that those are worthless
because you might not
if you only watch news that's sort of
right leaning
you could test all day in the laboratory
but it's not really testing the real
world situation
i'm pretty sure the only way you would
know if masks work
because obviously air is getting out
somehow you couldn't exhale
unless the air was getting out of some
hair right uh
anyway my my bottom line on masks is
that
it's not just that we don't know it's
that they're not pointing us at an
authoritative source
that's got to bother you right if
if they want us to believe masks work
and the science is unambiguous that's
what the claim is
how come they don't just point to it and
say here it is
and and every time the subject comes up
joe biden says look
i know there are a lot of doubters but
here's a link
go look at it yourself ask your best
data people to look at it
it's really clear it's right here i
don't think that exists
now part of the problem is that i don't
think you can measure it
i don't think that we have the ability
to know that a certain let's say city or
state
had better or worse performance because
of masks
i don't think we can know that i think
we can only know what happened
we can't know why now statistically you
could often
you know tease out a cause but there are
so many variables going on
and we don't understand the interplay of
all the variables and they're big ones
we just don't know i mean you know until
recently
we didn't know that it's hard to get the
virus from a surface
we didn't know until recently that the
super spreaders are really the the
problem
right if you could get rid of all the
super spreaders you'd probably get on
top
of this pretty quickly so there's a
whole bunch of stuff
that are really really big variables
that we didn't know just recently
until recently and i would argue there's
probably a whole bunch of variables we
still don't understand
so i don't believe it is scientifically
logically
possible for us to know that masks have
worked
by observing them in the field i don't
think that's the thing
that feels like confirmation bias that
said
it's my opinion that masks work and you
should do what you can to
wear them all right and i say that in
terms of a risk
management calculation
maybe they don't work i mean it's a
strange world
i could be surprised but the risk
management
is that you know there's not that much
risk of wearing it it's just a
huge pain in the ass but if it saves
lives well maybe
all right the other the other news was
uh it was a new york times had an
article that the uh
the blood plasma idea was saving lives
now the idea is that you would take some
blood into somebody who had already
recovered and had antibodies
you pump that blood or some condensed
version of it into somebody
and they would acquire the antibodies
from the person who got them
and then they would be better off
i was very happy to see that for
five minutes that's how long it took
somebody smart to debunk it now keep in
mind this is in the new york times
and it took five minutes to debunk it
now when i say debunked
i don't mean proven that it was
incorrect
but i do mean proven that you shouldn't
necessarily believe it
i still think it almost certainly works
if i had to guess
it would be hard for me to imagine it
not working because you know it's a
well-known process
that's been used for other things
there's just no reason it shouldn't work
but as one of my
twitter buddies who's uh really good
with data
anatoly lubarski he follows me
if you i think if you just google him
you can find him he's an excellent
follow
he's a game designer but whenever
there's this
data kind of a claim it takes them about
five minutes to debunk it and it doesn't
matter what the claim is and it's really
actually
it's impressive to watch and i hate it
i hate it love it because i often will
be
tweeting uh tweeting studies that i
think are a big deal and it's good news
and
hey this is great and we've learned
something and then
anatoly lubarski comes in five minutes
later with the counter claim and the
other study that shows it's
and i think not again
got me again so
i don't know if the plasma situation
actually works i do know that there's
some
at least one study as anatoly said that
showed it didn't
so now we have a study that shows it
didn't a newer study that shows it does
but apparently the newer study that
shows it does according to
anatoly was small study and not well
constructed
so we just don't know if it works i
would say
i don't trust any of the studies until
you've had lots of confirmation of them
here's one of the things that oh and let
me uh
back up to uh something i've been
talking about before i told you i was
going to form a news
review board if you will it's a
brand new idea and the idea is to find
some independent thinkers
who you could rely on to tell you what
fake news is fake news
now uh that should be helpful for people
on the left
and the right right it's not about just
calling out cnn
it's about calling out everybody so it
doesn't matter
if you left or right and at first i
thought i would organize it
meaning actually have you know group of
people who talk to each other
and they they know exactly uh you know
what the topic is and then they rule on
it or something like that
i'm starting to think maybe i should
just create a list of trusted sources
and then you can do what you want you
can go follow them and you'll get
you know just follow them and you'll get
better ideas i'll tell you who's on the
list so far
uh four different topics all right uh
andres backhouse
michael shellenberger michael tracy
eric weinstein christopher hill
uh who also is great at just using the
logic of anything that's
technology related and then i'm going to
put anatoly lubarski on there
now none of these people asked to be on
my list and
and they may not be happy to be on the
list i don't know i'm just saying that
if you were to follow the people i
mentioned and i'll add to it as i go
you would get the point and the the
counterpoint
to a lot of things which you've only
seen the point to
if you've only seen a claim you don't
know anything
so these are the people that you would
rely on to look for to know where the
counter claims are
and to look at the counter claims and
the claims and give you a sense what's
crazy and what's
not right doesn't mean that these are
the people who will be right
every time it does mean that they're
very smart
and they have independent minds and they
have a background in history
of being wherever the data goes very
rare
they're very rare to find people who
will follow the data and the logic
and we'll do it in public and we'll do
it consistently i named a few
i'll be adding people as we go all right
so that's where that's at i don't know
that it needs to be organized
maybe you just need to know who these
you know better minds are and you can
follow them
all right we've learned recently
that the super spreaders are the big
problem
and that those people who are super
spreaders literally have more virus
in their mouth and nose so you can find
that some people just have a big dose
and when they talk or sneeze or whatever
they do
or cough they have more virus to send
down
and that's worse here's a question i ask
and i assume this is not possible
but i just like to think of fun
optimistic things sometimes
so don't take this too seriously if
a gigantic amount of virus in your mouth
means something could you invent
is it possible a lozenge
that would turn color or change taste
if you had the presence of a lot of
coronavirus
is that possible now the first thing i
say is
uh the the cheap fast tests
are a chemical reaction in which
something changes color right
so are those deadly chemicals are those
chemicals you would never want to put in
your body
they should only be in the in the
chemistry test
or is there any way you can make a
lozenge
that would you suck on it for a while
and then you take it out and look at it
and
find out if it changed colors and you
could just
take one every day just take a lozenge
every day
now suppose there was also a logic
lozenge
that you knew would kill coronavirus
and you said hey everybody we don't know
if you have coronavirus or not but
why don't you just maybe chew on some of
these lozenges a few times a day
would that make a difference if you used
the right mouthwash would it get rid of
the coronavirus in your mouth or
do you need something more specific
to get rid of a virus in your mouth and
secondly
if you could get rid of your virus with
mouthwash or a lozenge or just some
physical process how long would it take
for your mouth to be full of virus again
in other words if you killed everything
on the surface of your tongue
on the inside of your mouth would it be
five minutes later it's full again
or is it tomorrow because that's a big
deal right
if it's tomorrow all you need is
mouthwash to end the pandemic
right am i wrong about that but i don't
think it's tomorrow it's probably
closer to five minutes than it is to do
tomorrow
how long it would take to produce more
virus to live in your mouth
yeah so people are are joking about
bleach
it does seem to me that have you ever
seen those uh
teeth cleaning lights where that you put
the solution on your teeth and then they
shine this blue light on you
to help the chemical do its reaction it
does seem to me
like you could have some kind of a uv
light
if it's the right kind i think is far uv
or something or uvc
that you could just stick in your mouth
literally like a flashlight in your
mouth
and just go ah stick it in there with a
uvc light
and clean in you know maybe 30 seconds
clean all of the virus that's at least
on a surface
and in your mouth would it hurt you i
don't think the far uvc
light would hurt you i think other kind
might but
here's my main point if the biggest
lever that you could pull turns out to
be
finding and stopping the super spreaders
who have a lot of it in their mouth why
don't we go after that directly
and just make everybody put something in
their mouth that kills it three times a
day and
see what happens after three weeks so
anyway i just put that out there i doubt
i doubt there's any
scientific thing there that would work
or else we probably know about it
all right uh here's another positive
thing
there are now new super
let's say air purifiers prior to the
pandemic
there were hepa filters and air
purifiers but
they were not quite up to the task right
you couldn't just turn on your purifier
and everything's good
you needed a leap of technology and now
apparently
those leaps are happening so there's a
company called
active pure which i believe they do as
one word
active pure so you can google them if
you're interested
and they make this um box that looks
like
just from the picture it looks like it
was it would fit on a tabletop
you know portable thing you just plug in
and apparently it's really really good
in terms of removing
the virus from the air and killing it
and it's so good that it might be the
difference between
opening a restaurant and not that's
actually how good it is
now these are claims you know you have
to be careful about who claims what
but what if
a restaurant was willing to get one of
those or
more than one depending on how many
zones they have i don't know what they
cost
but you know people are going to be
willing to pay some money to get back in
business
what what about a rule that says if you
have one of these per
whatever square feet they handle because
they they only handle a certain amount
of square feet
what if you had the right amount of
these
is that a good enough reason to reopen a
restaurant i feel as if we should
we should push to get an answer on this
really quickly either
an up or down right and i'll make a
direct
call to the biden administration
and say uh dear biden administration
if you have somebody who could do a
quick look at this device
and look at the science look at the data
they have and just give us an up or down
i think the public would like to know
that we'd like to know if we can get
back to our indoor spaces
especially restaurants and recreational
things that entire industry has been
devastated and we would like to get that
back on on track so biden administration
up or down are these things do they make
enough difference to
to maybe recommend and maybe fund maybe
biden would say
let's uh let's give you some financial
aid to get some of these into
probably senior citizen homes and
restaurants and anywhere that we need
them
now all this depends on the fact that
this technology works i'm not the one
who can guarantee that
i i'll just tell you there are claims
and there have been
at least some research and studies
all right you've probably seen the video
if you're on social media
in tacoma that there was a police car
that was set upon by a mob
and the mob was jostling the police car
and they surrounded it
and the police car decided that it would
have none of that
and just drove forward and
it looked like they ran over completely
one of the protesters
so at least one person got hurt and i
thought it looked like i saw the tires
go over a person
like all four tires i thought i saw that
but it was hard to tell in the video
that might have been an inanimate object
of some type that they were going over
but it looked like a person
and this is what i'd have to say about
this do we all agree
we don't want violence if you can avoid
violence
nobody promotes it nobody celebrates it
we're all adults here we know that
violence has no place
except in defense can we be adult enough
to say that
in self-defense nationals for defense as
well
that violence unfortunately is a
necessary tool
in some cases and there's just no way
around it
this is one of those cases i would like
to see
a lot more i hope i can say this on
social media without being banned
but i think the best thing that could
happen to tacoma is a whole
whole bunch more police cars running
over a whole bunch more people who
surround
police cars on top of that i think
citizens
should be doing a lot more of it too but
unfortunately they're going to go to
jail if they
you know if the if the judgment is that
they
they could have done something else but
i feel as though this
this trend of cars being surrounded and
attacked
needs a solution and i don't see the
government being involved
do you have you seen any government
action that would make any difference to
this
i haven't so the only thing i can
imagine
that would stop the trend is that every
time you see one of these stories it
goes like the tacoma story
a car was surrounded and then the car
ran over the people in front how many
times do you need to hear that story
before it stops happening so now we've
heard it
once and maybe it's happened a few times
in the past it needs to be every time
and and those people need not to be
punished
in fact here's what i like i'd love to
see our government say
that we don't plan to prosecute anybody
who gets out of a situation that way
if your car is surrounded you have the
right of self-defense
let me put this out there uh sooner or
later there will be a
you know there's somebody's going to be
prosecuted for this right there's going
to be a trial
in which somebody's car was surrounded
and they got out of it by running over
somebody
and injuring them or killing them i want
to say this in public
as part of their defense so they can
actually use this video later
to me as a reasonable human this is my
opinion
not my legal opinion right i'm not a
lawyer
in my opinion as a reasonable person
this is self-defense
and it's unambiguous self-defense and
the reason i say this in public is that
i'm a
reasonable public figure and that
if you're a jury and someday you're
wondering to yourself
was this person being reasonable that
person can call on this video and say
look
other people are reasonable and they say
the same damn thing
that in this situation it is
self-defense
even if you're not let's say let's say
the windows haven't been broken
and so arguably you could say you're not
quite in an
imminent threat would that be the the
argument it wasn't
imminent enough because your windows
were still intact
not good enough because the time it
would take between breaking a window
and dragging your body out is too short
all right too short that's like saying a
gun is pointed at your head but they
haven't pulled the trigger yet
it's still imminent right you can kill
the person who has a gun at your head
that's fair and i want to add to that
that the
car being surrounded is identical in my
reasonable citizen mind
so any jurors who are looking at this in
the future
i would ask you does it seem
unreasonable
to get into that situation with force i
think you will agree with me
that if you were in that situation you'd
want to get out of it before the windows
were broken
so i support the police officer who did
that i would be terribly disappointed if
there were any charges about that
they obviously have to look into it but
that's a police officer
who served the public that somebody
deserves uh
a commendation baby quietly but
accommodation
um here's the funniest but most tragic
part about the story
in the news today not that story but the
the world
is that democrats who voted
for biden will tell you in many cases
that they were really voting against
trump now what is the downside
of having a strategy where you're voting
against somebody
not so much for somebody
could that ever come back and bite you
in the ass well
one way that could go bad is this the
person you
you voted for was not quite as stellar
as you would imagined in your mind and
now we're going to see that start to
to play out and you can guarantee that's
going to happen
there will be buyer's remorse because
number one people didn't really care too
much what biden was going to do
so they didn't look into it that clear
that that much
i i think that's a fair general
statement
that people didn't care so much what
biden was going to do they just cared he
wasn't trump
they say that directly i'm not not
reading minds people say that pretty
directly
so now you're going to watch what he
actually does
and the first week a little rough
um and none of this is funny by the way
uh
because they're real people getting hurt
with this stuff but let me give you some
we'll walk through it and this is where
you learn the difference between an
opinion
and a half opinion now i made up this
word a half opinion
to cover the situation where people will
look at the cost of something but not
the benefits
or they'll look at the benefits and not
the costs
and democrats do that all the time it's
almost a defining feature
of the left that is not as common on the
right
on the right people will say well if you
do this
it's going to have this cost so let's
balance that
on the on the left they'll say let's do
this
let's do this because we like we like
fresh air
yeah fresh air is good let's do this but
they haven't figured out what that's
going to cost them
they're starting to learn that via a
process called the news
be it as it may uh so here are the
things going on so
so biden does the 60-day moratorium on
new oil
and natural gas leases and new mexico
the state of new mexico is saying yay
yay joe biden who we voted into office
as a blue state
yay joe biden wait you're doing what
you're gonna our oil industry
and so apparently new mexico has started
to realize
that if joe biden does exactly what he
promised to do and apparently is
on uh at least on oil drilling etc
that they will lose a ton of money in
their tax base
that pays for their schools and their
health services
so new mexico just realized that they
had been suffering under a half opinion
and they just figured out what the other
half was you lose your
school funding you lose your state
funding you lose your jobs
but is new mexico the only ones no
because the biden also is going to
cancel the keystone pipeline
which should cost a lot of jobs
and the unions that supported biden
are going to lose a lot of union jobs
and they're now realizing it
why because it turns out that get rid of
the keystone pipeline
was a half opinion now they've learned
that if they had an entire opinion they
would have anticipated this loss of jobs
and
loss of tax revenue now
do you think that trump didn't
understand
that the keystone pipeline had an
environmental risk
of course he did that was the whole
point but he also understood it had
these other benefits
he weighed them and then he made a
choice that i would call
an opinion a full opinion with the costs
and the benefits considered
well democrats are getting a quick
lesson on what an opinion is
and the half pinion is not serving them
as well as they had hoped when they
voted for biden
so and then then we learned i don't know
the details yet
that more troops are moving into syria
for what
why are their troops moving into syria
now presumably there's a
you know somebody on the ground an
american general
or somebody said we need these troops
for some specific thing
but let me ask you this which is your
safer situation
a president who says no to what generals
ask for even with good arguments
or a president who says yes because he
trusts the experts
which is your dangerous situation
because trump was the one who would say
no to the generals and even
basically called them idiots biden is
the one who would say yes to the
generals
and would call them the experts which
one
is the dangerous one well i would say
that trump also took the
advice from the experts about how to do
the rules of engagement
in that example trump taking their
advice
probably matched his own opinion so i'm
not sure he took their advice
so much as they gave him an opinion that
matched his own and then he could say
yeah we'd like to
be a little little tougher on those
rules of engagement
but what if here's the scenario that's
scary
your general comes into the president
says president we need a bunch more
troops
to do this or that that's what generals
do
the general is never going to ask for
less stuff
the general is never going to say
everything's done let's go home
the general is a fighter and the general
might want a job
in the private sector which would be
very happy
to have a little more war so do you want
the president
who knowing the incentives of a general
the way a general is going to conduct
things which will be more more and more
just like any leader any good manager in
the company is going to go to their ceo
and say
i need more those other departments they
don't
i don't know about them but i need more
that's every manager in every
organization so
general is going to be one of those they
want more
they need to do more that's how they get
their
their own career does well that's how
they get that job later in private
industry
so it feels like trump had been saying
no to generals i'm guessing that's just
a guess
pure speculation i feel as if trump has
been saying no to generals for quite a
while
as in maybe you don't need that many
people in afghanistan because there's
nothing there that we need to protect
it's going to go wherever it's going to
go no matter what we do
maybe it went something like that but as
soon as you see biden
immediately sending extra troops into
presumably harm's way
what happens to the people who voted for
him did they say
yeah that's what we wanted what we
wanted was cranking up the war machine
is that what the left wanted i don't
think so
i think they're just finding out what
they voted for
and war is definitely you know one of
the things that i would expect to end of
a
regular politician but less so anne of a
trump
who's not a regular politician so
uh mike cernovich tweeted about this
phenomenon about the uh
the democrats learning about what they
just bought
and he worded it in a funny way so i'm
just going to read his tweet
so mike cernovich tweeted it's been less
than a week and biden's voters are
outraged
it's a treat it's a uh
i think you meant testament but it's a
testament to how low
information they are that any of this
stuff surprises them
that's exactly the case they are low
information voters who just found out
what they voted for
and i feel like republicans largely knew
what they voted for
they knew what trump was but they also
knew what biden was
so so they're not so surprised but more
generally i'm finding that it's way more
fun to be a critic
than a supporter and watching this
develop in slow motion even though the
events that are happening may be bad
and i'm not going to minimize that there
could be some bad outcomes
i don't want to make light of the
outcomes but in terms of the process
it's kind of fun it's kind of delightful
that i can just sit back and criticize
biden for things
and i don't have any responsibility for
him because i didn't support him or vote
for him
so being able to criticize without the
without the burden of responsibility
it's way good it's way better than the
old way
and those who were criticizing trump for
four or five years
now i get why it was so much fun like i
understand
how much they enjoyed it because i'm
starting to enjoy it myself with biden
all right here's just a
thought just going to complete a thought
here
when we think about climate change we
tend to think in binary ways
the binary ways are we either go hard
and do a green new deal
size thing that's gigantic and changes
civilization
and you know it's it's a real drastic
thing
or you don't do enough which looks
closer to doing nothing so we we got to
have this
you know do nothing and die in the long
run according to the
climate change scientists or we do
something really aggressive and we kill
our economy and
there are other there are other problems
but probably
there's some kind of middle ground and
what i mean by middle ground is
something that's a stalling tactic
something that just puts off any
potential problems now
i understand that many of you watching
still believe that climate change is not
real
i'm hoping that you will evolve out of
that belief
at some point for the good of the world
now we could be surprised and anything's
possible
but my take on it is that climate change
is something you have to address
now uh here's here's a stalling tactic
should we need to stall and this is a
tactic which
uh might be good to do whether there's a
climate change risk or not
so ideally you would find strategies
that it wouldn't matter if climate
change is
catastrophic or less than catastrophic
it's just something you'd want to do
anyway such as
clean energy you'll want to do that
anyway so you don't need a crisis to do
it
but here's an idea suppose you get your
generation 4
nuclear power plant and you put it in
the middle of the desert
in northern africa and
because it's in the middle of a desert
you don't worry if it doesn't work you
know it's a little safer there
if you had a new design for a nuclear
reactor and something went wrong
well at least it's in the middle of a
desert but
let's say you you it works and you're
getting lots of power
you use that power to run desalination
desalination uh plants next to the ocean
and you pump in the water and you start
growing stuff
so you need more than water to grow
things you need uh reforestation
you know plans et cetera but it can be
done
and let's say you take it you take your
goal to reforest
the the desert areas in africa now
if you grew a lot of stuff where there
used to be desert
would you not have you know more
carbon capture because plants capture
carbon
so that part's good right so you'd have
more plants but
there's also another benefit which is
and i'll need a fact check on this it's
something i've read
and i believe it's true but if if i'm
off base i'm sure somebody will tell me
my understanding is that atlantic
hurricanes
form because of the tempered temperature
differential between
northern and africa during a certain
part of the year
and the ocean and that temperature
difference is what gets the wind going
which gets the hurricane started
so if you were to lower the temperature
in northern africa
by vegetation would it reduce
the power of the hurricanes even if
it didn't do much else about climate
change
that would be a stalling tactic because
the hurricanes are you know one
predicted problem that you know maybe in
50 years they would be much worse than
they are now
but if you started now and tried to
increase your vegetation and cool down
the
northern africa could you make a dent in
it
you know could you could you do enough
in time
to make a difference well the
so i just put that out there as a
question now somebody asked me when i
mentioned this the other day what about
all the salt
brine that's created by desalination and
that's a problem because you don't want
a bunch of
basically condensed salt you don't want
to throw that in the ocean it'll
even though the ocean is saltwater
you don't want too much of it in one
place so the way they get rid of it now
is they've got an expensive process
where they
spread it out and it goes back into the
ocean but
they spread it down so it doesn't matter
apparently there's a new process where
you can
fairly easily trans
change the salt brine into something
commercially useful
and oddly enough some of those
commercial uses are making
desalination plants more efficient so
you can actually you
take the salt brine brine turn it into
sodium hydroxide and uh
it's a caustic soda blah blah and it can
be used to pre-treat
seawater going into the desalination
plant
and pre-treating it uh helps the process
not gum up the works so apparently
they can make money on the soul brine
and what they don't use themselves they
can sell because it has some commercial
value
and one of the big problems with
desalination plants is that they go
offline
and this will help them not go offline
so
i'm just going to put that out there i
have no idea if this is just dumb ideas
or not but there probably are some
some stalling tactics that would be good
no matter what right wouldn't you like
to have fewer hurricanes
sure wouldn't you like to be able to
reforest
a desert make it more useful sure
so maybe reasons to do it anyway
um
yeah salt brine not salt brian
somebody says give it to elon musk well
i think first you need the
the nuclear power because the the
desalinations
is it desalinization plants yeah
desalinization plants
or desalination which word is right
you know what i'm talking about all
right
that is uh all for now let me show you
what it looks like
outside it's looking good out there
i think i'll go out and try to enjoy
this day
a few more days here and then back
to life all right
um am i are we still in the golden age i
think we are we just don't know it i
think we're going to realize it
the pandemic threw us a loop but
uh we'll get on top of the pandemic and
i think we're going to
i think we're going to learn so much
from the pandemic that it's going to
look like a better world when on the
other side
let me give you just a small example
restaurants and hotels now
instead of giving you a physical menu
that's often on a date will give you a
barcode
so that your menu appears on your phone
i love that
and oh here's a feature at this hotel so
i met the
four seasons at bora bora and
a feature that the four seasons has is
that you just use an app
to text them for anything you need so
anything from
room service to you know making
uh let's say scheduling appointments for
things
during your your stay you can just send
one text
always to the same person so you don't
even have to worry what department
you're sending it to
and so i sit over here and i just say uh
can you give me some coffee and some
bagels or whatever for breakfast
and a text comes back immediately 30
minutes
when it shows up and i think to myself
every way that this was done before
needs to be eliminated
the only way i want to deal with my
hotel
is by text it's great and
maybe this is how this becomes permanent
and the only way i want to see my menu
is on my phone that's great
and i wouldn't mind having air purifiers
in my restaurant anyway
right i don't care if it's the the
normal seasonal flu or somebody's got
you know rabies i guess that's a bad
example or tuberculosis or something
i wouldn't mind having one of those
active pure air
purifiers in every restaurant no matter
whether there's a pandemic or not
so there are a whole bunch of things
that are going to be better because of
what we learned from the pandemic
so yeah i think the golden age is still
on track
but delayed and that's all for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
if i can turn this off
