hey everybody
come on in here it's time it's time
again
for the best part of your day yeah and
every time i say it
it's true and in order to enjoy
the best part of the day in the best
possible way all you need is a
cup or a mug or a glass of tanker gels
or stein a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind you fill it with
your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the dopamine here today the
unparalleled pleasure it's called the
simultaneous yep
and it happens now go
siptastic civilicious
sip credible that's how good it was
well here's a positive thought of the
day
you ready the positive thought of the
day
you know how whenever there's a war
nobody wants the war but wars have a way
of creating
innovation so you get a lot of
inventions
that come out of the fact that you have
wars
and one of the things that i'm just
going to put out one example it's
not that this particular one is the one
that's going to happen
but there are a few things that are
probably being worked on
right now that could turn into something
big for example
um you know that dogs apparently can be
trained to sniff out coronavirus
how many other viruses would dogs be
able to
sniff out probably some other ones right
now if a dog can sniff out
coronavirus and other viruses perhaps
could you create a chip or a device
some kind of hardware software situation
that could be as sensitive as the dog
which is hard i realize that
the dog's sense of smell is ridiculously
good
but do you think it's impossible that we
could ever make an artificial
nose that could smell at least as well
as the dog can smell
to to find a virus because we might be
at a point
where we just have public sniffers and
they find everything while it's new and
we just don't have pandemics anymore
because we can just literally sniff them
out
now all the attention of course is on
the near term stuff like the
therapeutics and the vaccines
but i'll bet you somebody somewhere
in the world is in a laboratory working
on an
artificial sniffing machine if anybody's
watching this who knows anybody who's
doing that
let me know because i would put a very
large bet
on somebody trying to invent that right
now
um and i and i believe that there have
been earlier versions of sniffing
machines that actually
were good but not as good as dogs maybe
we could get there
here's another one what about some kind
of
uv light that doesn't hurt humans
but it's bad for viruses put in lots of
public areas
and i think that's being worked on too
so we could find a
it would be easy for me to imagine that
this
um project warp speed which caused all
the
vaccine making companies to work at you
know
super pace they probably in
in the process of working as fast as
they can
they probably invented all new processes
they probably figured out whole new ways
to do things
so my guess is that our ability to
create vaccines in the future
is going to be way better probably
because didn't you think that it was
impossible to create a
coronavirus vaccine we heard that
six months ago six months ago
the top experts were saying nobody has
ever made a coronavirus
vaccine that works and now we have it
that's probably a big deal you know have
have we come
close to the point where we could pick
off any virus
and do what we just did because we just
it looks like i mean we're on the border
of i'm optimistic
of curing an incurable virus
what would that do to the world if we
learn how to consistently
cure incurable viruses i don't know that
this is the one
incurable virus that we'll ever be able
to get on top
of i've got a feeling we invented
processes along the way
that would allow us to maybe take on
other viruses that we couldn't take on
before
so that's the good news all right here's
a little update
uh fact jack there's a lot of rumors
going around and i
i like to clear up the rumors and if
you've fallen for any of the fake news
i like to clear it up so here's a little
uh fact check
the dominion voting systems did not kill
epstein so if you're seeing anything
anything else uh it's fake news
right so the voting software did not
kill epstein
that's fake news
the president retweeted me again i guess
last night and i didn't realize it when
i woke up this morning and
i looked at one of my tweets and i
thought well i guess that was a pretty
good tweet look at the re retweets on
that baby
15 000 retweets don't see that a lot
at least at my level and i'm feeling
pretty good about my
tweeting ability until somebody else
tweeted that the president had retweeted
me
and that i thought oh well that would be
a reason why there would be so many
retweets
here is the tweet that the president
retweeted
you may have seen those i said the most
corrupt institutions and individuals in
america have declared that the election
was
free of fraud and that's good enough for
me
what's wrong with the rest of you so the
president retweeted that
now the funny part about this is that he
retweeted me
was it earlier this week or was it last
week
a few days ago he retweeted me and the
thing that that
creates is it it paints a target on my
back
if you get retweeted by the president
you end up in a lot of
articles where they'll show the retweet
and they'll say
crazy thing the president's thinking and
crazy thing the president's doing and
now he's being supported by other crazy
people so apparently my twitter
followers have reached a level where
if i if i tweet something
just the fact that i tweeted something
can become national news
which is the damnedest thing it just
sort of happened in the last
few months that that that's especially
true
so the president retweets me and if it's
exactly like the last week
all these minor publications and other
bloggers and stuff are going to start
you know
shooting me in the back because i'm just
in the story
that's all it takes you just have to be
in the story and you're you're a target
so that'll start all all up again
can we confirm yet do you feel that this
is fair for me to make this claim
that uh my prediction that the world's
greatest
dad joke actually happened
meaning that there were tons of people
who were lying to pollsters
intentionally and that that would be the
big reason that the poll numbers were
way off so the
the existence of quote shy trump
supporters
i've seen it confirmed in two places
breitbart
and someplace else do you think that
that's confirmed
do you think that the the news has
accepted
that the reason the polls were so off is
because people intentionally were
pranking them
because they'd always say that right you
know you've heard it from me
but you don't hear the actual legitimate
if you can call them that
news business you don't say them saying
and the reason is
people were pranking them they don't say
that
but i feel like that is the reason
because so many people said they were
and then it turns out that the category
that the pollsters
most got wrong according to breitbart
is uh the thing they got wrong was they
they failed to detect
trump's support from quote educated
whites who tells dad jokes
okay who is it who is it
you know you know who tells dad jokes
educated white people now also
uneducated
white people and other people as well
it's not
we're not the it's not the only group
that tells dad jokes
but what is the biggest group in america
that tells dad jokes
i'm not bragging about it i'm just
saying
you know and i you know i don't have
science to back me up
but don't you think wouldn't you
wouldn't you go with this
uh gross stereotype that has
educated older white guys
that tell the dad jokes right
would you agree with that or not i'm not
saying that there's you know
no educated black guy who ever told the
dad joke i'm just saying
it's sort of concentrated in one
demographic group
now is it a coincidence that that's the
same demographic group
that was underpolled what would be the
other reason
that pollsters can't find educated white
people
what would be the other reason are you
saying that educated white people don't
have
cell phones or phones what would be the
other reason
there's no other reason educated white
people are probably pretty easy to reach
they have phones they answer them
you know they have opinions so i feel as
if
that prediction was uh a hundred percent
correct
and one of my one of my greatest
predictions
but uh not not like i was the only one
who predicted it or anything like that
but it was certainly one that lots of
people doubted
there were lots of people on the other
side saying i think those poll numbers
are right
but they were not however it was all
overshadowed
by the temporary situation
that it looks like biden one emphasis on
temporary we'll talk about that
cnn in one of their
news stories on their site said spoke
about the claims of election
fraud and they
include this sentence claims are all
false
now do you think cnn can report that as
a fact
that all of the election fraud claims
are false does that sound like a fact
to you now here's the thing
it could be a fact right has anybody
we have not conclusively ruled out that
a hundred percent of the fraud claims
turn out to be false
hasn't been ruled out but you know what
it also hasn't been
ruled in it's definitely not a fact it
is something that could be true
if anybody looked into it in any depth
it's something that could be false
if somebody looked into it in any depth
but what it surely isn't
is a current fact that can be reported
as effect
let me ask you this so it's also been
reported by let's see politifact and
lead stories and the ap and more
quote that there's no credible evidence
that dominion voting systems software
impacted any vote tallies during the
election
according to the associated press new
york times and politifact
now let me ask you this question so
speaking of the associated press new
york times and politifact
which one of those organizations got a
court order
to do a line by line code review
of dominion's voting systems along with
an audit of all their processes
and interviews with their employees
which one of them did that
um um i don't hear anything yet
none of them how in the world could
anybody conclude
that this vote software didn't impact
anything
how the hell would they know the fact
that they think you're so
freaking dumb that you would take their
denial of any evidence as proof
of no of no evidence they're really
playing you for suckers here
in a really big way now
to be fair so i'm going to be a little
bit
fair and balanced here if i can
if you were in charge of the world
you would probably you know i'm speaking
hypothetically if you were in charge of
the world
there might be times you didn't want to
give people the full
technical truth because it might be bad
in other words my p people might take
the truth
and act in the wrong way misinterpret it
get too worried about it for no good
reason etc
and so i have some empathy
for major news organizations and the
people in them
who probably are feeling the weight of
responsibility
of keeping the republic together because
that's real
the news business could tear apart the
republic
or they could hold it together it
appears
that the major media is trying very hard
to hold the republic together
i like that all right i i want to
dislike it because it feels like it's
working against
what i think is true which is that there
was some fraud in the election i think
we'll find that
but i also appreciate
that there is a higher responsibility
than the truth
i i hate to say it but there is a higher
responsibility
than the truth the higher responsibility
is to take care of your
you know fellow human beings and if a
little bit of a lie
a little bit of a shading of the truth
gets that done i'm not really going to
be the one who says
well that was unethical or immoral or
impractical
or illegal or anything if the
if the intention is to protect the
republic
i can't hate that even if i wouldn't
have played it the same way
all right but
i feel as if it is a direct lie
to say that nothing's been proven in the
context of nothing being searched for
and the complexity is such that you
couldn't possibly know if anything
happened or didn't happen
it is unknowable by its nature until you
do a deep dive
and short of doing that deep dive to to
declare that it didn't happen
when all of the all of the requirements
for
it to happen are in place so
the place that you would look for a
crime is where there are a hundred
percent of all the variables that would
suggest
oh there definitely was a crime we
haven't looked into it
but we're pretty sure let me give you an
example
if you took a high-end automobile
and parked it in a dangerous
crime-filled neighborhood
and left it unlocked with the keys the
keys in the ignition
and then you wait let's say you wait a
year
do you need to go back and check to find
out if the car was stolen
you don't really have to check if you
leave it there for a year
and it's unlocked in a bad neighborhood
a high-end car
with the keys clearly in the ignition
it's stolen
all right do you need to do a deep dive
you don't even have to go back and look
that car is gone likewise if you have an
election system that is deeply
complicated
and you waited long enough somebody will
find a way to take advantage of that
complication
not once in a while not
we're worried that it will happen not
it happens often not there's a bias in
that direction
no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying
just like the high-end car
parked in the dangerous neighborhood
with high crime
it's definitely going to be corrupted
not a little bit
not sometimes not once in a while every
single time
you just have to wait long enough now
have we waited long enough
meaning have there been enough elections
and enough years have gone by
that anybody who could find weaknesses
to exploit
would have by now found those weaknesses
and exploited them
of course somebody says this is
interesting
but disingenuous what the do you
know about my inner thoughts
seriously what do you know whoever said
that
what do you know about my inner thoughts
and why would i even lie about this
what would even be my motivation for
being disingenuous
on this topic right now can you think of
one
did i run for election nope
would i i don't make money somehow
nope my my traffic is higher
today after trump has allegedly lost
than it's ever been i don't have
anything to gain the only thing that i
have a benefit for
is telling you the the closest thing to
a useful
filter on reality that i can i don't
have an incentive
that's outside of any ethical bounds
because everything that i want and need
is well within those bounds i either
have to do a good
credible job at doing this or nobody
watches
what what reason would i have to
lie to you really
seriously what reason would i
have to lie to you think about that
because people need a reason you need a
 reason
all right and if you think it's because
i would be let's say
embarrassed if i predicted trump and he
didn't win
then you really don't know me because i
don't get embarrassed
by mistakes i wrote a whole book
about it about how i don't get
embarrassed by mistakes it's right over
my shoulder right there
so i wouldn't care about getting
embarrassed i wouldn't care about
failing i wouldn't care about being
wrong none of it would have much effect
on me at
and what reason would i have to lie to
you
really can you think of one because i
can't think of one
all right um
triggered
um here's another fake news from cnn
their headline says
trump threatens to deny new york a
vaccine
did you see uh trump's press
uh press event there and did you see him
threaten to deny new york the vaccine
nope nope that didn't happen at all
do you know what did happen the opposite
of this headline
that's what actually happened so cnn
says
trump threatens to deny new york a
vaccine
here's what really happened trump said i
sure wish we could get you that vaccine
but new york won't take it
because they're going to do their own
testing etc but i would sure like to
give it to you
can you let me give it to you is there
anything i can do to please let me give
you this vaccine
because i would like to give you this
vaccine if you'll let me
that's what happened that's what
happened
and then cnn reversed it
and makes a headline trump threatens to
deny new york a vaccine
didn't happen it just didn't happen
all right here is the
uh most interesting persuasion thing
that happened
that is being reported incorrectly of
course
and it goes like this and you probably
saw this story that
i i need to give you trump's quote
because the the way he chose his words
is the story
and it goes like this trump said i will
not
this administration will not be doing a
lockdown
trump said speaking for the first time
and
then he went on and said hopefully
whatever happens in the future
who knows which administration it will
be i guess time will tell
but i can tell you this administration
will not go to a lockdown
now the way it was reported is that the
president
has doubts about his own claims that
there is fraud and that the election
went his way and so it's been reported
as
that even he doesn't think he won
necessarily
here's a here's the story that they
missed
are you ready what is trump's biggest
risk or the claim against him at the
moment there are lots of claims against
the president all the time
but the biggest one the hottest one at
the moment is that he's going to
try to become a dictator and not leave
the office
even if the election is certified to be
biden's
that's his biggest problem right people
think he might literally just try to
cling to
to the office in his statement
where he talks about i guess time will
tell
and who knows which administration it
will be
he is signaling as clearly as you could
possibly signal
that he's not going to keep the office
no matter what
right did you see anybody report what i
just said
the biggest story completely ignored
that the president has pretty much
confirmed
that in his own opinion he's not going
to be fighting to cling to the office
if it goes against him i feel like
that's as clearly as you could say that
completely ignored and then they they
turned that into
i guess he thinks he didn't really win
the vote
that's not exactly what i'm seeing i
mean that's also true
but i feel like what we're really seeing
is him
giving no seriousness whatsoever to the
ridiculous thought that he's going to
turn dictator and try to cling to office
there's no indication of that now did
you see
there was some kind of weird statement
that general
is in milli the joint chief of staff's
made
and it was reported that it was a sort
of a broad side to the president and
that really he was
sending a message to the president that
the military
is you know is not gonna get involved
in the transition or whatever and
i thought this general billy guy i don't
have much confidence in him frankly
from just a little bit i've seen is only
about his gaffes
so i'm sure he's done great things or he
wouldn't be in that job
but what the public sees is not terribly
encouraging
and here's what i think that the the
head of the joint chiefs should have
done
so the way he played it was like it was
really serious
and there was some real risk that the
president would try to get the military
involved
that was really the wrong way to play it
really the wrong way to play it here's
how he should have played it
let's say i'm the i'm general milly i'm
the
joint chiefs of staff and the press says
will you get involved if the you know if
there's some dispute about who the real
president is
here's here's how you answer that
you laugh at it you say that's not the
job
of the military ha ha no we wouldn't get
involved in that
in any way civilians need to work that
out
but if you need if you need somebody uh
killed you know come see us
but we don't get involved in this stuff
and just treat it
like it's not even serious because
that's the way i want to think about it
as a citizen i don't want to hear that
the
military is mulling it do you want to
hear that the military
treated the question like it was even
serious
i don't even want to go that far i don't
even want to hear
the joint chief of staff deny that they
would get involved
i want them to think that is such a
stupid freaking question
that they're not even going to answer it
it's like oh come on
that's not what we do ridiculous no
it's funny that you would even ask that
question do you know the military no we
don't do that this is not what we do
and everybody who thought this was going
to happen
i guess they could still say well it
still might happen but anybody who had
this
thought and really really thought
that the president would try to cling to
power with a military intervention
that is really crazy i mean that's
different from just having a wrong
opinion
that's a little bit crazy i think
the the press
continues to do their trick of debunking
the weakest
claims so if you're a low information
voter
you think they debunked all of the
claims because what they're saying is
there are no credible claims now what
they usually mean is that they're that
the courts
have not seen credible claims of fraud
yet
that might be true i don't know what the
courts have or have not
seen i'm not sure anybody knows do we
have we all seen the claims but whether
or not the ones that have been submitted
as claims are
valid or supported by the courts or not
i would see them as a stalling action
in other words you want to you want to
get the public a little bit pregnant
with the idea
that you're looking for fraud and it
might be there
so you want to get that idea in the
public's head so this first flurry of
lawsuits
probably were just a stalling action to
keep that idea in the public's head
and say we're working on it actively
which would sound way better than
we think there's fraud we're not doing
anything about it
right imagine if the trump
administration had said
we think there's massive fraud and then
people would say all right what
lawsuits are you filing and they'd say
uh well we're you know we're thinking
about
getting some together at some point
don't have all the data
what would that look like it would look
like there's nothing there
right but by filing a bunch of lawsuits
on things which may be just the first
things they could think of or
the first indications that there might
be a problem they just get the
they get the uh the system going they
get something that looks like momentum
momentum is everything i'm going to be
talking about that later as well
if you get the momentum looking like
there's something your team is doing
that's moving forward
then everybody's minds can get in that
mode it's like oh
okay there might be something coming and
then you can
you can be ready for it so i think
that's all that's happened the good
stuff
uh is still to come on the the evidence
but you'll see the debunking going after
the weak stuff and here's the easiest
one to debunk
so easy that i wouldn't even make this
claim even if you thought it was true
here's a claim that even if you think
it's true
it's the worst one that dead people
voted
now do you think any dead people
voted in this election i do
yeah in the whole united states you're
telling me that there wasn't
one ballot filled out by a relative you
know for their
dead dead grandfather or something oh
yeah
there's a hundred percent chance
somewhere in america
a dead person voted at least once
right now how how does the media debunk
it what they do is they'll go to find
one person who is on a list that is
claimed to be dead people voting and
then they'll find that that person is
actually alive
and they'll say look ha hahaha these
idiots
they're claiming that all these dead
people voted but we picked this one name
off the list
we found him he's live here's a video of
us talking to him
hahaha dead people don't vote
but of course that's the selective
debunk they'll just
it's easy to find people who are
mistakenly on the list
of of dead voters it doesn't mean that
it didn't happen
now if i had to bet i would think that
the total number of dead people voting
will not rise to the level that that
would change the election
result but certainly not the only claim
is it
did you see matt gates tweet i retweeted
it
so he retweeted a graph that shows that
historically
you can tell how many people in each age
group have
have registered to vote and you can see
you know this year
the graph shows this many registered and
the following election this many
and then you get to uh you get to 2020
and in 2020 the number of people over
the age of 90
who registered to vote just went off the
charts
off the charts now
could it be a coincidence or could not
coincidence but could it be
the result of really good democrat
uh get out the vote do you think the
democrats were so good at getting out
the vote
but it mostly worked for people over 90
because the data suggests that even if
the democrats were
excellent in their get out the vote then
it really only worked for people over
90.
that's interesting isn't it why wouldn't
there get out the vote
work for everybody why would it work
really really well for people over 90
but it works about the same as it worked
in prior elections
maybe a little bit better about the same
as prior elections
for everybody else what could it be
now could there be any legal
explanation for this i think so
i think so there could be right i can't
think of one
but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
right so you never want to think
that your own inability to imagine
alternative explanations
means they don't exist it might be maybe
there's some reason
for this maybe they did a maybe you know
let me give you an example
let's say that the get out the vote was
um
sort of separated in different teams
and the teams that worked on young
people didn't have much luck
but the teams that worked on the older
people were just really good at what
they did
that could be possible couldn't it
but is it likely probably not
so that's the sort of thing in the data
that's going to make a lot of lot of
eyebrows go up
all right um
correct me if i'm wrong i tweeted this
this morning
correct me if i'm wrong but 100 of the
press and pundits who have not
personally analyzed the voting data say
there's no fraud
right so everybody who didn't look into
it
did not personally research everything
from
counting the ballots themselves
to auditing every line of code and every
part of the system
for the voting uh system private
companies
all the people who did none of that say
there's no fraud there
is that does that pass the fact check
that all the people who are saying
there's no fraud have also
not looked into it personally right
now how many people have looked into it
personally
and really dug into the data
and concluded after looking at all the
voted voting data in the relevant places
how many people who know how to do that
and have dug into the data
have concluded hey folks i looked at all
the data and it looks good to me
i don't see any problems how many of
them are there
still zero i think zero
right how many people looked into the
data and then concluded there was
a problem or at least your eyebrows are
going crazy
because it sure looks like there's a
problem how many
people like that quite a few quite a few
so again i'm open to a fact check
but i believe all the people who haven't
looked into anything
say that they haven't found anything no
surprise
because when you don't look for things
it's easy to not find them
all the people who who could have looked
into it
and found that there were no problems it
seems like i've heard no reports of that
but all of the people who have looked
into it and really dug into it
have found problems or alleged problems
or the appearance of problems fact-check
me
are all those statements true
does it mean anything well it might
we'll find out
here's my current best guess
of where this is going there are
deadlines
in terms of when you have to put in your
claims of
election misconduct do you think that
we'll get past
those deadlines before any good
information comes out
about that at least that proves there's
some problem with the vote
very likely very likely that
we will learn more and more
as time goes by we'll learn more and
more and we find might find more and
more fraud
so here is my belief about the world my
belief about the world is this
that in any complicated system you end
up with fraud
whether it's the stock market or the
voting system they're all complicated
systems
and over time they all become subject to
fraud
no exceptions so given that it's just a
big complicated system
the voting system the odds of it being
full of fraud are
really a hundred percent it's not even
any chance there's
no there's no chance of no fraud the
question is how much
right i think we're all on the same page
even democrats
the yeah there's always a little fraud
always a little bit
but not not necessarily enough to change
an election with
a 5 million vote difference so that's
the first thing i think we agree on
that there's got to be a little bit now
if there's a little bit of fraud
a baseline fraud that also tells you
that fraud is possible right
fraud is possible because it happens and
i tweeted some stories about
uh specific ballot stuffing uh
prosecutions etc
where we know it's we know it's possible
and we know it's done
so then the question is what is the
extent of it
and again this gets back to the the
press
creating a an image at least in
democrats
that trump was actually literally hitler
now if you know how to cheat and it's
possible
and you could do it to stop who you
believe you've been brainwashed to
believe as hitler
how how much fraud would you get in that
year
compared to all the past years when the
only thing you were trying to do is win
the election
versus stop the end of the world well
every bit of your common sense and logic
and reason
says that whatever amount of fraud there
had been in the past
would not even be close to what you
should expect
in this election again i'm not saying i
personally saw it
i said that this setup of thinking that
hitler is running and having you know
decades of knowing that fraud is
possible it pretty much guarantees
massive fraud
so if you ask me scott what would you
bet
that massive fraud massive being
more than ever before i'll just let me
just define it as more than ever before
as opposed to enough to change the
election what are what are the odds that
we've had more than ever before
and that it's widespread fraud this time
100
there isn't any chance that didn't
happen there really isn't
now the second question still matters
a lot was it enough
that's what you will learn in the coming
days
so far i don't think even in my own
opinion
i don't think i've seen enough in the
public
to say oh yeah that's that's it right
there
but the time that you would see the
stuff that's good
is sort of next week all right
so we don't have to argue about who will
be right
we can just wait just get back to me in
next week and if nothing happens next
week maybe it's the week after
but in two weeks you don't have to
wonder if they're going to be strong
claims
let me put that out there i've seen a
little bit more than you've seen
and i think they're going to be strong
claims
so but here's how i think this is going
to go
it's based on the fact that the media
has proven they can disappear
entire stories and create narratives
that are just not true
and and make that the truth that the
public
sees now they've demonstrated that in
the past several years
and i don't have to give you all the
examples of things they've disappeared
and things they've created and nothing
so they do have the power now that even
if trump
and his legal team can prove that the
election was stolen
and that reversing the the fraudulent
votes would be enough to give him the
re-election
even under those conditions where the
court can see it the public can see it
the data is right in front of you even
in all of that proof
i don't think it's enough because
reality is not based on votes
reality is a collective agreement of
what is real
and i believe that the news media is so
strong now they can create a
big enough consensus that biden won
anyway that trump won't be able to keep
the office
even with proof that he won
now is that the most out of the box
prediction you've ever heard
probably but i actually don't see how it
could go any other way
let me let me give you the other
possibilities so one possibility is that
trump proves he won and then it's just
reversed
and then the court says yeah okay you
made your case
you proved you won we threw out a bunch
of fraudulent votes
and so it's president trump reelect what
would happen
do you think that joe biden would just
say oh okay
all right good well i guess that's the
way it goes well i guess i'm not
president
and then his his supporters would say oh
darn darn it darn it all to
to pieces we sure wish we won
but i guess we didn't so better luck
next time
guess we'll try harder next time no
nothing like that would happen
so the path in which biden just says
okay the data was not what we thought i
changed my mind we'll get rid of our
transition team
forget about those cabinet appointments
and we'll i'll just go back to my
basement
i don't think it can happen i think i
think we've
passed the point where reality
can be adjusted that much in other words
people
uh the people who think biden one are so
firm in that belief
that i don't think there's any amount of
counter evidence
that will change it and i think
that president trump is going to be
faced with this decision
the george washington decision which is
sort of perfect
and the george washington decision is
this
i could take power because he probably
could
but would it be best for the country
and i think he would have to think
seriously about
his lifelong instinct you know to win
this would put that all all into focus
the most you know competitive
personality we've ever seen in the
public domain
the person who wins wins wins never
quits wins wins wins never quits
could he say you know i've proven i've
got more votes
and i'm going to step down could he
if he did it's george washington time
because he would do it for the love of
the country it would certainly not be a
personal
personal preference you know it wouldn't
be a personal preference
you could be sure that he doesn't
personally want to step down
that i feel confident about that but if
he did
it would be a completely selfless act
except that you would get joe biden as
the president which would be a problem
now he might negotiate something for
that you know
but imagine if he did and then started
his own media company
here is the beauty of this play
if trump stepped down even after winning
the technical vote the electoral college
because the just the country's mood just
couldn't handle him
he would know that the real power in
this country is not the elected
people that would prove that the real
power in this country
is the press and who can create the
narrative
and he might create his own press
so imagine a president trump being
essentially driven out of office
by a news press fake news
bubble and then saying oh
it looks like the real power is not
politics it looks like the real power is
to own a media platform
and then having him start one
would you watch it you know you would of
course you'd watch it
so i think the most likely path is that
uh president trump will show he won and
still not be able to take the office for
re-election
and he'll start a media platform because
that's where real power is
real power is in the media it's not in
the government anymore
what were the odds that the republicans
would pick up a bunch of house seats
but lose the presidency by 5 million
votes
do you think that that happened do you
think that republicans
picked up substantial seats in the house
while the president and the same party
lost by five million votes
i don't feel like that happened could
happen right
can't rule down it's not impossible
but i just don't feel like that happened
i also don't feel like joe biden got
more votes than anybody's ever gotten
there's just a lot of stuff here that
just doesn't look quite
quite right now our new
our new hobby for the next several days
will be uh
picking out social distancing hypocrites
because instead of thanksgiving i guess
this year will be zoom's giving
and zoom giving as a holiday is the most
empty holiday
of all time at least thanksgiving has
some real meaning
but zoomsgiving is just an annoying call
with your relatives
and so far the following social
distancing hypocrites
alleged nancy pelosi she just had to
cancel a thing
governor newsom was apologizing for
going to a dinner party
the chicago mayor was partying with the
celebrants over the election
and then chris cuomo caught on camera at
some some place
without his mask so i don't care about
any of that stuff really
none of it is i don't know it just
doesn't have any weight
but you'll see a lot of it sort of a fun
hobby finding all the
finding all the people who are cheating
all right there isn't much new news now
and part of it is because the president
has decided to starve the news media
i don't know what what his thinking is
on this
he might just not want to be in public
because
you know the vote didn't go his way so
far and maybe he just doesn't want to be
in public for a while and he can be
forgiven for that
but i feel as though the president
staying away from the press
is punishing the press isn't it
it feels like he's punishing them on the
bottom line
by taking away their their click bait by
taking away their uh
all their footage and everything that
gets them uh clicks and and revenue
so he's really he's really handicapping
them by just staying out of the news
now i also think that if he believes he
can win and it's pretty clear that he
has
that belief at this point if he believes
he can win in these challenges
the best way he could play it would be
to stay low
would you agree now it doesn't seem in
character you you expect him to be out
front
you know in front of the army fighting
hard all the time it's just his
personality
but the best strategy if that's what's
happening and i don't know that that's
what's happening
but the best strategy would be to
quiet down all of the fire that he
normally brings to every situation
and it looked to me like at the that
little press conference he
gave which was just on the topic of
coronavirus it looked to me like he was
really trying to tamp down
the you know the fire and the gasoline
and if he does that enough and a little
time goes by
maybe the public will will start to get
these little indications that there was
something wrong with the election
but trump himself maybe just some tweets
about it but not too much
to to flame things up
his best play is to let it play out
because if the if the process plays out
and then the process says
you're the president then maybe
just maybe he can avoid huge riots
there'll always be a little bit of a
rioting but if he goes
in like a um like the 500 pound gorilla
he says i'm gonna change the this
election
you know i'm telling you that it's wrong
i'm gonna do this
i'm gonna make this result overturned
that would not be a good look because
then that looks that plays into the
dictator thing and he can't accept the
election
and all that stuff but if he just steps
back
and starves the media so that they don't
have any good stories to get your blood
boiling
what would happen i think you just your
your tensions go down the election
starts to feel like old news
because things move so fast and you can
get used to anything
so the best strategy might be to to
dribble out
you know these numbers look a little
a little sketchy you know
it's not just these few numbers we found
some other numbers that look a little
sketchy too we'll let the press deal
with that
and maybe some of the senators will
weigh in and
we'll see how it plays out so
i don't know if it is strategy or not
for him to stay out of the uh and the
public he might just
not feel like it and that would be
perfectly appropriate
right if you if you have this election
outcome
you were entitled to a little bit of
golf right
i mean nobody would begrudge him or
biden taking some time off
and by the way the fact that biden took
some he's taking a few days off
to recover from his campaign
i swear to god it would almost be more
fun to have a president biden
just to see him struggle to do the job
and i'm not proud of that but it would
be
interesting to see all right
yeah so there's some i'm seeing in the
comments that elon musk
took four coronavirus tests with the
same tests and the same nurse
two of them said he had coronavirus and
two of them said he did not
and he's asking the question uh are
these tests even real
i'm paraphrasing and i guess there's
some
some question about the sensitivity of
the tests
if they do i don't know 35 cycles
whatever that means they're
good if they do less than that they're
not so there's some question about
whether the tests that we're using
are even tests or is it just a coin flip
i don't know yeah it's a coin flip test
all right that's all i got for now
i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope is off and
youtube's still on he took the antigen
test you know i keep getting confused by
the whole
uh antigen versus finding the virus test
um somebody says scott is not mega
because he operates according to the
media rules
i don't know what that means um
get a grip okay how's your health
never better my health is great
by the way maybe the best it's ever been
in my life
weirdly enough um
wow your questions are going by so
quickly it's hard to even see them
your thoughts on online hypnosis
training i don't think it works
my experience is that if you don't do it
in person
it probably doesn't work i can't
guarantee it doesn't work
but i i wouldn't bother trying it
slaughter meter i'm going to bump it up
to 96
96
um what about biden's
anti-fraud organization
well i haven't heard from them how to
find a good hypnosis
hypnotist people ask me all the time how
can you find a good
hypnosis instructor or a good hypnotist
and it's really hard to answer that
question because usually the only way
you can do it is from
reviews or personal recommendations
but if somebody is a good hypnotist they
could certainly get somebody to give
them a good
recommendation so hypnosis is the one
uh service where you should really not
trust
the reviews on reviews
because it wouldn't be hard to get
people to give you good reviews even if
you didn't help them uh do you really
think he'll do it george washington
um i don't know that i could predict he
will do that
here's what i do predict i do predict
that we will
know there was massive fraud in the
election and they will
know that before inauguration i don't
know
if we will agree that it was massive
enough
that he should be the president and if
there's any gray area
i think he won't become the president
but i think historians
may very well say you know he was the
president
but he just didn't take the office
it says scott they are deleting evidence
well i don't know who they are or what
evidence
um somebody says
dan bongino owns parlor i think he's he
was
wasn't he an investor or something i
don't know that he owns it
he'll have to stay to preserve integrity
i don't know about that
maybe
oh yeah it does look like trump let his
hair go gray
i don't know was that a coronavirus
thing did he do what everybody else did
and
you know he couldn't do as much hair
care
ann coulter thinks that trumpism trumps
trump
well trumpism was sort of a reflection
of the
voters so in that sense yes
uh get kraken there was some kind of
tweet about release the kraken
that was deleted before i could see it
so i don't know what that kraken is all
about but it's in the
it's on twitter um cital is the name of
the
company that all the votes go to and
apparently they have
offices in germany why do any of our
votes go overseas
don't you think that if we could do one
thing to protect
our votes of this country the one thing
would be to make sure that
the data on the voting never left the
country
i feel like that would be basic now it's
not that you can't hack it remotely
but if you put the server in another
country
i feel like that's just asking for
trouble
why is the stock market going up people
are saying
i think people are optimistic about the
vaccine
and that's mostly it what if they delete
the dominion
evidence how would they delete it
if dominion deleted their records and
their logs
they would never work again so if they
were to delete that they would also be
out of business
i don't think that'll happen could
happen but that would also be an
admission of guilt
somebody says voting is not transparent
you are correct
it's not uh what if they delete
the dominion evidence well so i've
answered that if they delete it it would
be an admission of guilt
uh thoughts on rallies today versus
anti-funds so is there going to be a
big mix-up with trump supporters and
antifa today
i don't know if antifa wants to fight
because they they think they got joe
biden right
and do they want joe biden i don't even
know if antifa wants
a real president where they just want
the end of society i don't even know
what they want
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
