not as good as this one now if you'd
like to take this up to levels that
could only be described as super all you
need for that is a cuper mug or glass a
tanker chells or Stein a Cen joer flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
delightful dare I say
super well my theme for today is things
in the news that my smart Democrat
friend will never
hear the things in the
news that are well established as facts
that my smartest Democrat friend he'll
never
hear and just watch as we go how true
that is it seems like one of those
things that you know clearly would be
some kind of exaggeration or something
nope nope it's going to be fascinating
well of course the big news is that the
Super Bowl is today and uh because we're
America we tried very hard to find some
way to ruin one of the best things we do
the Super Bowl how could we ruin it h
could we make it super political
yes let's do that let's make it super
political Let's uh add a national anthem
for well it's the black national
anthem uh and I for one say that we
can't I can't get enough of this I think
we should have the regular national
anthem which I call Obsolete and we
should have a national anthem for every
individual group in the country because
you know that's what the whole point of
a national anthem is that each
individual ual group gets their own so I
would like a anthem for bald white guys
I think I'll start writing that and if
you're not willing to run my national
anthem well I guess you're some kind of
a bigot aren't you yeah we need to
embrace and amplify this if you're
complaining about the black national
anthem I think you're completely off
base because I would like to hear the
Filipino American national anthem
um the elbonian national anthem and
maybe the Scottish Scottish American
national anthem they're a lot of Irish
do they have any kind of a national
anthem Latino the Latino national anthem
why can't we see the Italian exactly
Italian Americans okay so let's uh get
some national anthems for all of them
now in all the hubub about the Super
Bowl could we take a moment to not lose
track of what's really important yes yes
sports are fun they're fun and they they
they feed our souls in some ways but
let's not lose what's
important what's important is that just
a few short years
ago um there was this massive problem of
our police abusing black people that
they had stopped for rest huge problem
and the public responded uh were massive
black lives matter riots which they some
would call protests and there was lots
of kneeling a lot of kneeling as sports
events and a lot of people were you know
cynical and they were saying how can
this kneeling and this protesting will
it really make a difference in our
terrible racist country how could this
work but it worked it worked it turns
out there hasn't been a single instance
of police abuse of black citizens since
Biden was elected and no need for
kneeling the kneeling is done can we all
just take a Victory lap for a moment
honestly I was a little skeptical that
it would help but it did and I don't
think you can doubt that so here's
something that my smartest Democrat
friend will probably fail to notice that
the black lives matter protest and the
kneeling completely worked to eliminate
police brutality against black Americans
and I think we can all celebrate
that all right I'm moving on um oh I'm
trying to move on I'm I'm trying Taylor
Swift Taylor
Swift I couldn't do it I couldn't I
couldn't do it I tried to talk about the
Super Bowl without mentioning and I
literally my body took over and
something happened to me I I I couldn't
actually do
it all right but having handled that
important business let's talk about a
study how many of you are aware that the
Heartland Institute did a study on the
mailin ballot situation and determined
through statistical
means that the 2020 election was quote
almost certainly won by Trump now the
almost
certainly is they do a number of
scenarios and almost all the scenarios
show that he won
handly now the without getting into the
details of this
study um it went into let's say the
irregularities and the uh legal
violations involved because in lots of
cases there were let's say ballots that
were counted that maybe technically
should shouldn't have been because of
dates or some irregularity about them so
there were a number of categories of
things which happened that were unusual
for that year and if you were just
basically adjust any of the
irregularities Trump wins every time
almost every time
now do you
believe that my uh smartest Democrat
friend who I often like to mention do
you think he's aware that there is a
study
that put a lot of effort into looking at
it and came up with the answer that
there's no way that Trump really won or
Trump really
lost nope he will have no idea that it
happened now I'm not saying that he will
question it I'm not saying that he would
believe it if he saw it I'm saying he'll
never know it
exists where our press has gotten to the
point where they can just disappear
anything we we first noticed this
several years ago right you notice that
the Press could make any story
disappear just imagine that there's a
major study that largely proves the
election was maybe not rigged but
because of the way it was done
irregularly and the way the you know the
way things were let's say overlooked
that normally would have made a vote
knock
count uh it's a pretty big
story now I don't know if it's true you
know I spent a lot of time telling you
that people do the statistics wrong and
they're looking at the wrong data and
all the data is wrong so I wouldn't
automatically assume this is true don't
don't automatically assume it's true
that would be irresponsible but I'm only
talking about the news do you think that
if the news had gone the other
way it wouldn't be in the mainstream
media every single day oh yeah if they
had done the same same kind of
calculation on Trump's 2016 victory
and they had found the same statistics
just they would be
reversed you think that wouldn't be the
biggest story in the
country of course it would and it
wouldn't matter if the statistics were
correct or not so the story is not even
you know just whether or not the
election was
sketchy uh the story is that this can
never get any
Oxygen just they can't get any Oxygen
it's amazing all right um and the one
place I saw it was behind a pay
wall so the only place I saw it was
behind a pay wall it might it must be
somewhere else by now all
right um did you ever see a terrible
crime that you couldn't find a way to
feel bad about does that ever happened
to you and then you don't want to admit
it you know I I've told told you that
when I see a Serial murderer but he did
a really good job of planning and ex
executing obviously uh I always say well
that's terrible I certainly feel bad for
the victims and then there's a part of
me that I don't like to admit that's a
little bit impressed by the level of
planning and work that went into it
little bit impressed I just don't say
that part out loud well here's another
one of those situations so apparently in
San Francisco there was a wayo wayo
vehicle wayo a company uh that makes
self cars and for reasons unknown I
guess a crowd decided to Graffiti one of
these cars and they surrounded it and
then they broke a window put some uh I
think fireworks on the inside and it
caught on fire and it became a big
spectacle where they uh big spectacle
where everybody was dancing around and
celebrating now I do not want to see any
self-driving cars being destroyed for
ready any reason right so everything
about that is
odious
except I probably shouldn't admit
this but I kind of love the attack on
the self-driving
car I don't know why I don't know why I
I feel like it's the same reason
probably the crowd responded you know
first of all I'm a boy all right I'm a
boy so I like to see blow up is
that
wrong I can admit it I like to see stuff
blow up in fact there's a there's a
whole Instagram uh like page or Channel
or whatever you want to call it that is
just stuff blowing up I can't tell you
how much time I spend looking at that
thing wow that blew up too look at that
is this going to blow up it blew
up I never get less interested in
it so I can kind of appreciate apprciate
it even though I disavow it don't do it
don't catch any self-driving cars on
fire but I totally get it I get it just
don't do
it all right here's my prediction for
the
day how long before a terrorist uses a
self-driving car to deliver a
bomb yeah you just got quiet didn't you
because there's no way that won't happen
it would be the best way to do it I
can't think of a better way now I assume
the self-driving cars will have some
kind of way to indicate if a human is in
it but you don't really need to be in it
do you you know couldn't you called a
self-driving car put a put a dummy in it
and a big you know dummy full of
explosives in it and if anybody looked
in the I don't know if anybody monitors
it to see if there's a human there but
it kind of look like it
it's going to happen there's going to be
a self-driving
car that carries a bomb eventually so
look for that um here's some uh shocking
science
news this is shocking so the American
College of uh
pediatricians reviewed more than 60
studies and concluded quote there is no
long-term evidence that mental health
concerns are decreased or alleviated
after gender affirming
therapy
huh it it's almost like the whole thing
is sort of a mass hysteria or
something it's almost as if it's not
based on either observation or
science it's almost as if everything
that you knew to be true is
true now I did actually expect that some
people would report better Mental
Health
um but to say there's no long-term
evidence
none are you say you couldn't you
couldn't you couldn't find one person to
say I'm better
off how is that possible you know how I
always mock studies that I disagree
with whenever the conclusion is
something I don't like I remind you that
science is all rigged and and
all the data is bad and the peer review
is ridiculous that's when I don't like
the result or I disagree with
it do you think this result is
true I don't think there's a I don't
think there's one chance in the world
this is true that whoever did this study
and found out there is no long-term
evidence none not a single person do you
believe that do you believe you can't
get a single person to say yeah this
worked out for me glad I did it not one
now let me remind you what cognitive
dissonance is do you know what cognitive
dissonance is it's when you do something
that doesn't make sense even to you even
to you it doesn't make sense and so you
reinterpret it in a weird way that makes
it make sense when you know it didn't
make sense so it's it's how you protect
your brain from thinking you're
ridiculous so everything I know about
the World suggests that even if let's
say you took a thousand people who
transitioned when they were young if you
took a thousand people and talked to
them I would
expect at least a quarter of them to say
it worked even if it definitely
didn't even if and I don't know if it
did or not I'm not saying it did I'm not
saying it didn't I don't know but
there's no way you don't get at least a
quar to the people saying I'm pretty
sure it worked I think I you know maybe
I'm not happy but I think I would have
been worse off if I hadn't done it so
how in the world is this the only survey
in which a 100% of the people say the
same answer you believe that there's a
survey of a large group of people about
any topic any Topic at all be it health
be it political be it not you think
there's any topic where % of the people
will say the same thing and no obviously
this is
 now how how many of you wanted
to immediately believe it because it
agrees with your political point of
view I
did for the first five minutes I thought
well that's something hey there's some
there's some evidence and then I think
about it for like one minute and I
realize oh why would this be the one
thing that's
true everything else in the news is fake
all of it and this is going to be the
one story that's true
maybe but the odds of it are so small
I'm going to Discount this as
 all right um
so uh this it did change my plans though
because for a while when I was thinking
that um that maybe you know maybe I
could remove my balls and I'd be happier
I mean I I didn't really make a plan for
it I was just looking at all the options
I was like you know maybe I'd be a
little bit happier and then I thought
maybe I could get the Apple Vision Pro
and using a enhanced reality and virtual
reality I could just make it look like I
transitioned but I'd be the only one who
knows like I look in the mirror and I'd
just see myself as a woman and by the
way not just a woman but a woman who
could do pretty darn well in in sporting
competitions and I don't like to
brag um tuer Carlson uh allegedly met
with more than Putin in Russia there's a
report that says I don't know if it's
true yet that he met with Edward Snowden
and Joe Biden's uh accuser terara Reid
she's the one accused them him of
sexually abusing
her
um what do you think
do do you think he talked to them now it
is making it look like um I I like the
fact that Tucker Carlson appears to be
not afraid of
anything but of course the uh the
narrative that's being used against him
is that he's being a uh what do they
call it the useful useful idiot yeah
that Russia is using tuer Carlson for
their propaganda how many of you would
say that's a true statement that Putin
is intentionally using Tucker for
propaganda
obviously obviously yes
transparently obviously 100% no question
about it is that a
problem that's just describing everybody
you ever did an interview anywhere do
you know have many interviews I've done
do you know what my purpose of the
interview is my purpose of the interview
is propaganda I want I want me to look
good and I want people to you know maybe
buy my book or
something do you think I'm there to tell
you the truth I mean I I don't generally
lie but I'm not there to tell you like
the whole
story have I ever done an interview
where I said you know I wrote a I wrote
a new book the reviews are great if you
look at it but to be honest I have
terrible character if you want the full
story uh the book's okay I mean I'm
being honest but I'm kind of a jerk so
maybe you should think about that and
not buy that book right I don't tell you
that I just say the book is good you'll
love it which it is you love it you
should see the reviews they crazy
reframe your brain you should get it
right away it'll change your life it'll
actually change your life literally it
will change your
life um but no of course Russia is using
for for their propaganda of course but
it's all
transparent we all know it it still
works it doesn't matter that you know
it's propaganda still works because it
does expose you to a point of view you
hadn't seen
before but I do wonder why Tera Reid is
in
Moscow it's for her safety isn't
it I think she was afraid of actually
being killed by the Biden uh
regime do you think she had inside
information or was she always working
with
Putin I don't know I I suspect she
wasn't working with Putin but Putin is
smart to give Asylum to people like that
to Snowden and teror readed yeah she she
alleged that she was in
trouble I don't doubt it I don't doubt
that she got death threats you know I
think people on both sides are getting
death threats all the
time anyway so I I like that Tucker is
talking to all these people just because
nobody else is doing it and if you
didn't know that the other side is
pushing propaganda you shouldn't be
watching the news in general I mean if
you if you don't know that Putin is
trying to push some
propaganda you're really not you you're
not qualified to watch
television that should be kind of
obvious all right
so there's more evidence that NATO was
always the baddy and that uh maybe maybe
the story we've been fed for years is
completely
 because it is of course it is
that doesn't make Putin the good guy no
it just means that you've been lied to
for years all right let me give you an
idea um so do you know that
uh that after when the the German
reunification was on the table then NATO
promised that if Germany
reunified uh that NATO would not push
further toward Russia and it's in
writing that was the actual agreement
and that was a pretty good agreement in
my mind because unifying Germany is a
pretty big deal I mean it's a really big
deal so if you could get that and the
only thing you had to give up is to
agree well I sawed in writing um the
only thing he had to give up was
expansion of
NATO I feel like that would probably be
a pretty good deal I see some people
saying it's not in writing um and you
might be right I did see the actual
writing so I saw the document with that
Clause circled this morning is it true I
don't know I mean it might be
fake but anyway so the reporting today
is that NATO has been lying NATO lied
about Ukraine NATO lied about Germany
and NATO has just been an expansionist
power and then it's all about the
military-industrial complex and the
neocons pushing it and it was always it
was never about peace it was never about
that it was about destroying Russia and
getting their energy resources and
degrading them and making our
military-industrial complex
richer of course it's always more
complicated than that but that's part of
it now do you believe that do you
believe that NATO might have been the
one that was lying and being aggressive
and
threatening now that doesn't mean that
Putin wasn't also lying and threatening
and being aggressive right nobody
nobody's giving him a
pass I'm not giving him a pass I'm just
saying that in situations like this it
would be normal that both sides
suck and everything that we've seen
about everything in America in the last
seven years would suggest that NATO is
corrupt now the reason I said that is
that everything else
is everything everything else has a
monetary connection which NATO has in a
very big way um everything with that
much money involved is corrupt
everything everything is there's no
exception once you get that big and
there's that much
money it's always corrupt in some way if
not thoroughly at least in major ways so
you don't have to wonder you just have
to know it's a big a big entity with
lots of money involved there's nothing
else you would need to know do do you
remember all those uh
audits I
don't do you remember all the
whistleblowers I
don't well you would you don't know
what's happening with NATO it's just
like a big old slush fund as far as
we're
concerned um according to Colonel
McGregor who was talking about zalinsky
he reminds you that zalinski was a a an
actor which is weird to go from actor to
head of a country but not unprecedented
Ronald Reagan for example um you could
argue that Trump was on TV before he was
in politics so it's not that unusual
that that a charismatic person becomes
leader um but what you might not know is
that the same billionaire that funded
zelinsky's TV
rise is the one that uh funds the
Neo-Nazi as of Battalion this is
according to
McGregor and also supported zinsky for
president with the blessing of Victoria
nuland who some say is the
cia's uh operative who's just ruining
Ukraine for some purpose that is hard to
discern but has to do with money and
whatever
um and that zalinsky ran for office on
the promise of Peace but almost as soon
as he got there it turned into the
biggest war ever
so is is that a narrative that you
accept or is that just the the
alternative narrative you know cuz the
The Narrative of the people who would
like us to fund Ukraine would be that he
is this democratically elected leader in
a democratic country that canceled that
canceled
elections cancelled elections uh he's
only there because the United States
staged a coup in
2014
and to me it looks like every single
part about the Ukrainian experience was
corrupt and wrong and not even in the
Americans best interest that's what it
looks like
and so people are saying hey if we
stopped funding it would be a tragedy to
which I say
okay like I don't like tragedies but
that's not really a reason not to do
it that's not good enough because
funding them created the biggest tragedy
do you think that stopping funding them
is going to make it
worse yeah it's a moneya laundering
headquarters we assume yes
to me stopping funding is the easiest
decision in the world because we've lost
we've lost all faith that funding makes
things better and all the evidence
suggests it makes things worse now let
me ask you
this would you feel bad if the poor
Ukrainian um citizens uh ended up being
managed by the evil Russian
Empire would you feel bad for the just
the ordin citizens not not the
politicians not the generals that fought
against Russia not them they they're all
going to be dead but would you feel bad
for the
citizens well not compared to what
they're going through right
now not compared to what they're going
through right now and it seems to me
that the only only reason Putin has a
claim at all is that his management of
some areas appears to be superior
according to the locals you know I'm not
saying it's superior but if if there are
people who would vote in a referendum
will take Putin that means something I
mean assuming the referendum isn't
rigged so I would say that there's no
argument
anymore uh in favor of funding
Ukraine that the fact that Ukraine will
lose I think is
irrelevant I think I I think that at
this point it seems obvious that any
negotiated settlement would give Russia
the parts they already control and
probably Russia would be happy not
controlling the rest of it at least
short term you know long term they might
push for it in a variety of clever ways
but I can't see any reason to support
zilinski um I don't even see him on my
side I don't see Victoria Newland on my
side do
you
so
why would I fund somebody that I can't
even tell if they're on my side that it
seems like that would be the minimum
requirement are they even on my
side I don't I don't see it in any
obvious
way I see them taking my money I don't
see them making me safer in any
way all right
um so there were two US representatives
who voted against a measure that would
PR prevent any of the participants in
the October 7th terrorist attack in
Israel from immigrating to the
US now I can't think of an
easier thing to
pass okay can you imagine anything that
would be easier than saying let's not
allow the terrorists who actually you
know helped overrun Israel and murdered
people and take children as hostages and
all that and so our representative has
wisely said let's let's do a let's pass
a measor or vote on one something that
will keep them out of the US in case
they try to get in and believe it or not
Rashida TB and Corey Bush voted against
it they voted against allowing
terrorists known terrorists not
potential terrorists known terrorists
into the country now on one level that
sounds terrible right sounds terrible AO
AOC voted for it
yeah but it's also very clarifying isn't
it this answers all of my
questions I have no I have no further
questions yeah these two people are not
on my
team and how they remain in government
is just a mystery but apparently Corey
bush is way behind in the polling for
reelection so it looks like that's going
to correct itself I think T is probably
safer
in her
District um here's some New York Times
headlines uh number one that these are
both from The New York
Times uh I want you to see if you can
tell which one is about Trump and which
one is about Biden I'm going to remove
the names all right so the headline
without the names one headline is memory
loss requires careful diagnosis
scientists say memory loss requires
careful diagnosis scientists say all
right that's one headline at a different
time this
one uh this person I won't mention the
person is mentally unfit no exam
needed is is mentally fit no ex oh you
guessed right yeah good guessing yeah it
was an opinion piece but uh the New York
Times said no you don't need to examine
Trump he's obviously mentally unfit but
when Biden is obviously mentally unfit
in front of all of us you know memory
loss requires a a careful diagnosis
you're going to need to get some
scientists involved in
this
and this is the news the New York Times
this is the primary source of news for
my smartest Democrat
friend do you think he's aware that the
New York Times has reported these two
similar stories you know completely
different depending on who the person
was probably not because if you're not
an X you don't see the two stories put
next to each
other um so anyway all right here's
another one uh Wall Street Journal
reported that
Facebook uh deboosted Tucker Carlson's
Putin interview by 50% at the demand of
the White
House is it can you is that a real story
I saw a uh I'm I'm having I'm having
trouble believing that that was really
in the Wall Street
Journal so I'm going to put a question
mark by that I saw it on acts but I
didn't see a link to the article I see
some people saying true but did you see
the actual article there's is that
really that's like a real
story that that today after all the
attention about the social media
platforms suppressing things did they
just do that like a week
ago this or this week actually that just
happened uh Wall Street Journal Jim here
you didn't see it okay I'm G I'm going
to say that
that's all right we we've got a
confirmation that's not real all right
so I'm going to back off of that I'm
going to back off of that okay so let's
let's put a fake news story like a
attack on
that oh it might be a year old oh okay
might be an old story okay yeah that
that didn't there was something about
that that didn't ring true so let's say
that one's probably not true that's my
current take all right
um and the end wokeness account um
points out that satire and reality are
have
merged uh so here's the ex
example Biden said that gun should not
be in the hands of the mentally
unstable Joe Biden your president said
guns should not be in the hands of the
mentally
unstable and he says that while in the
throws of dementia and controlling our
new nuclear
Arsenal that's right the man who has
obvious dementia so much so that even
his own team can't help but sort of
acknowledge it's there
controls our nuclear Arsenal and has the
gust come on TV and say gun should not
be in the hands of the mentally
unstable now that would sound like a
joke a few years ago and that was just
normal just normal do you think that my
Democrat friend is aware that Biden has
a mental
problem do you think he's
aware I don't uh I'll bet you that the
news he heard is that Biden mixed up
some names of leaders and then he also
heard that Trump does it too and then he
remembered that he knows some old people
who do that too and then he said that's
nothing mix up some names of some people
I'll bet you that's what he thinks I'll
bet you he's never seen the compilation
clip I saw today of Biden losing his
place it's like five minutes of Biden
saying and uh the uh would uh well
uh yeah well uh well uh well well
anyway if you see it all together it's a
pretty daming thing but he won't see it
he'll never see that you'll never see
the clips never see the
Compilation All right now here's my
favorite part of this the Newsday
Jonathan Turley uh who you should read
every day um is calling out the
the mainstream media is reporting and
the White House is reporting on the her
report Hur report now that's the one
that said that Biden was an elderly man
with memory problems and uh didn't seem
like essentially that he wasn't fit to
stand
trial now how can you possibly spin that
the only way you can spin that is if you
completely own the media you would have
to completely own it to spin that and
let me tell you the things that
according to Jonathan Turley the things
that they spun number one did everybody
notice that all the news said that uh
the comments about Biden's mental
capacity in the her report were quote
gratuitous how many times did you hear
the word
gratuitous a lot right do you think that
that was accidental no of course
not that's professional work that's
professional
if you can make your sound gratuitous
you've said it's unnecessary to pay
attention
to but it was actually the most
important thing that happened in the
world so the
news is telling their people the
Democrats that the most important news
this week that a a real serious person
said that the president of the United
States is incapable and put it in
writing and put his name on it and he
works for for the Attorney General of
that
president that is the biggest news in
the
world but you can make it go away with
one word
gratuitous because if you can get people
to believe it was
gratuitous by definition it didn't
matter it was unnecessary it didn't
matter they're all they're trying to
convince you that the
observation doesn't count because it
wasn't his job to say it but of course
it was his job to say it he he's
supposed to give the reasons that he's
going to convict or the reasons he's not
going to and that was one of the biggest
reasons it was literally his job to say
that and they reported that it wasn't
his job right in front of you it's the
most obvious part of his job and the
media said well that's not his job with
a straight face and they all said it
like nobody there's not a single
Democrat supporter who's willing to say
well well obviously that is part of his
job he's supposed to say why he's not
pressing charges and then none of them
are willing to say well if you say he's
incompetent he needs to be
removed and if the Democrats are saying
no it's not true he's not incompetent
well then he needs to be he needs to be
convicted because that means he
willfully all right let me give you the
actual things the media lied
about this from tur's uh
article
um
so so here are some things he said
President Biden said that the special
Council report found that the that Biden
did not willfully retain
materials did you all hear him say that
he went on TV and says the report has
cleared me it says I did not willfully
retain
materials are you aware that the that
the report says in
um repeatedly not even just once that he
definitely willfully retained
materials it says it clearly and
repeatedly and then the president went
on TV and with a big smile told you it
said the
opposite do you think that my Democrat
smart friend knows that the actual
report says the opposite of what the
White House told you it it says no of
course not he never would hear that news
how about this one
um Biden said that he did not disclose
any classified material to his ghost
riter but the special counsel found
precisely the opposite it reported very
directly and specifically that he did
exactly that and then Biden came got in
front of the world and said nope the
report says I didn't do
it the opposite and how did the media
cover
that
they didn't fact check him they didn't
fact check him I'm got I'm not I'm just
beginning uh again this is from Jonathan
Turley who's a superstar you should read
all of his stuff
um Biden said that the material that he
had was not highly classified with quote
that red stuff around the corners I
guess that's what indicates it's really
super classified in fact the her report
found that the material was quote highly
sensitive including an Afghanistan
related Memo from the National Security
advisers to Barack Obama in 2009 marked
top secret it was actually marked top
secret so do you think my Democrat
friend knows that
no
um Biden said that all of his materials
were locked or in lockable filing
cabinets we all saw the video of the the
boxes falling apart in his
garage every single person in America
saw
pictures of them just sitting in the
garage but he said every single one was
locked in file cabinets or or it was
locked in his garage with his Corvette I
think I heard him say that
but how many people have access to a
garage I don't know about your town but
in my town our garage doors are open all
the
time I mean it's just common that people
have the garage door open because it's
not really any you know real crime where
Biden
lives
um and as turle points out Biden was
working off a teleprompters when he told
these
lies that means that a number of his
staff made him stand in front of the
public and say the opposite of what the
report
said and that that was okay and there's
nobody on the in the media who's
reporting what tur Le is reporting in
you know sort of the mainstream stuff
you see on TV nobody's reporting this
that he actually got up and said hey
good news the report says the opposite
of what it
says that happened right in front of you
while we watched that that all happened
right in front of us
amazing
um so here's an interesting uh fact of
things happening the opposite of how you
think they should in
theory uh Biden's open borders were
bringing in more voters for the
Democrats and I know you've probably
everyone watching this has said that to
be true now he's bringing in voters Elon
Musk has said is true and it's obviously
true they're bringing in people who they
believe they might be wrong but they
believe will be Democrat voters
now but what's actually happening but
what we observe is the opposite no
matter how many come across and the more
that come across the the better Trump's
poll numbers look compared to
Biden so they're bringing in Democrat
voters by the millions and the net
result is that the number of voter
Democrat voters has been decreased by
millions as has anybody noticed that the
more the more Democrat voters they bring
into the country
illegally the fewer Democrat voters
there are because he's lost you know at
least black men have have bailed out to
some degree so if the polls are correct
the more people who flow across the
border to someday be Democrat voters the
more likely Trump will
win but here's the thing are you worried
that the uh election will be be rigged
is anybody worried that the election
will be
rigged
yeah uh I would like to remove all of
your concerns about that for all of you
who are worried that the election will
be
rigged you should not worry about that
do you know
why no not until I tell you do not worry
about the election being rigged because
it doesn't matter who wins the media
will tell you that Biden
won the the media has gotten to the
point where the election results could
be 10 to one for Trump and they will
simply tell you Biden
won they can actually do that at this
point now I'm being you know hyperbolic
I don't think they'll actually do that
but I'm not joking about the following
this is not a
joke they have now created a media
brainwashing
Enterprise that is so powerful and has
so many layers they
literally literally could show you the
result of trump winning the most votes
take it off the screen and tell you
Biden
won and actually sell it to the American
people they could actually sell you the
opposite of the poll results you don't
believe it they just sold you the
opposite of the horr report
they sold you the opposite of the uh the
report on Russia collusion they sold you
the opposite of the fine people
hoax we we elected a president whose
primary theme was a hoax that everyone
in the media knew was a hoax I think I
mean I think they all know it just think
about that now if you think that he
can't run on a hoax well he did run hoax
and you watched it right in front of you
you you don't think we have a we've
reached a point where the media can just
tell you who won no matter who won we
have I'm not predicting it but we have
literally this is not hyperbole we have
reached the point where this is within
the realm of completely practical
Behavior they could actually jail you
for protesting it am I right would you
go all January 6 some people would but I
wouldn't because I would just end up in
jail I'd end up eating it if they just
told me that Biden won I don't think
there's anything I could do about
it and you you couldn't
either just think about that they can
now just tell you who won and they could
sell that
completely completely
uh they accused a YouTube movie yeah for
an attack right on the
embassy uh all right so that's just a
mindblowing thought that they can ignore
the election results no matter what they
are but here's the good
news
um at least our social media companies
are totally legit uh here's a story from
a doge designer who says that uh meta
has suspended the Facebook and Instagram
accounts uh that were tracking Taylor
Swift's private jet now apparently the
uh jet travel is public information but
you'd have to know where to look for it
so there was some gentlemen who had been
reporting wherever Taylor Swift Swift's
chat is so I guess Taylor's people must
have complained and now Facebook and
Instagram uh dinged him
however uh they did not ding him for for
tracking Elon Musk private jet um and
both of them are still running on
Facebook and
Instagram that's right they kicked they
kicked off the accounts that are
tracking Taylor Swift but not Elon
Musk are there any
questions are there any questions about
whether or not the entire system is
rigged the entire system is rigged
yeah um jack babic points out that uh
SNL was joking about debank not even
being real word but apparently Mike
Lindell the my pillow guy got
debanked this week Mike Lindell just got
debanked in other words he can't do
Financial stuff
why I assume it's just politics I
assume so let's see our financial system
is is rigged the um social media
companies except for X are
rigged what else is
rigged well um I'm going to keep saying
this not because it's new but because
it's it saves lives so if you don't mind
I'm going to save a few lives and you've
heard it before once again I saw another
old video of old New Yorkers walking
down the street and every one of them
was a good weight
they all looked healthy it is of course
our food supply our food supply is
completely
destructive and do you think your news
is reporting that well maybe not the big
news you know there might be like
individual blogs and articles and stuff
about it but it is insanely obvious that
the entire industry is killing the
country now I've told you that you know
you know I had horrible health problems
for a few years during the pandemic of
you know not related to vaccinations CU
I started before the
vaccinations and you know great infl
inflammation and you know I was gaining
weight but I thought oh it's just age
related you know everybody gains a
little weight but as soon as I took
wheat sweets and processed foods out of
my
diet my weight just dropped down to my
perfect weight stay there ate all I
wanted all day long as much as I wanted
as long as it was healthy food and all
of my inflammation went
away yeah all of my inflammation I was
actually giving up on exercise for a
while because it hurt too much now I can
Sprint I can run all over the place yeah
so it it was it was just food it was
just food and I saw Bill Amman made a
simil SAR comment today that the food or
food's probably a
problem so yeah our food supply is
totally
rigged our big Pharma totally rigged our
politics totally rigged our media
totally rigged but at least the
financial system oh never
mind um here's what I'd like to
see I would like to see Congress if
there's any kind of a process I don't
know if there is I'd like to see
Congress do some kind of a resolution or
something uh to or maybe a congressional
uh inquiry to find out who's the
president
literally I want to know who's making
the decisions because it might be
Jill and I feel like we need to know now
I don't know if there's any way to find
out I don't know if there's any kind of
official I don't know if there's an
official process for doing that but
don't you think think the Republicans
need to make at least a show of it that
they should at least make some noise
that we don't know who's running the
country Putin doesn't know who's running
the
country and apparently as far back as
Bill Clinton days if you believe this
story when Bill Clinton was initially
interested in maybe Russia joining
NATO uh he came back and said I was told
we can't do it meaning that he had a
boss
or bosses
yeah probably the
CIA so I think that Matt Gates or
somebody should or maybe you know MTG
should just try to ask who's in charge
and actually find out who makes the
decisions now of course the White House
will say it's a
president um there was a study by a
Cambridge academic who suggested that um
if Harvard
hired its professors on a
meritocracy there would be uh almost
zero black
professors do you think that's
true that's true because you want to
believe it's true yeah I don't know it's
based on a study based on a study by one
person is that
credible no it's not really credible but
if you wanted to believe it it would
give you some uh some backup
um here's what I think I think it's
obviously
true that there would be fewer because
that's the whole point of Dei is to
Goose the system you know where it
wouldn't exist on its own through normal
means so there there's certainly some
Distortion there but why is it that we
keep acting like you can fix it once
people are
adults there's literally nobody who
believes that
right like who who thinks that you can
have a poor
education and then uh as long as Harvard
lets you in anyway everything's going to
work out well it's really just the
admissions process no it's the poor
education like all of all of the
problems we're trying to solve in our
adults are already too
late and why can't we focus on the
school systems it's because the teachers
union is is enormous and they have a lot
of money because they're a lot of
teachers and they control the Democratic
party so the Democrats can't they can't
fix the problem that they are the cause
of systemic racism is
90% Democrats supported by teachers
unions and therefore we can't fix the
schools if you could fix the schools so
that every kid of every color and income
could get a quality
education which should be a national
goal if you could fix the schools so
every black kid had a really good shot
at a good education you assuming their
home life supported it you don't think
you get way better
diversification and everybody would be
completely happy with it like who would
 about it if everybody got there
the same way
nobody you know nobody about
Sports I mean except jokingly nobody
 that uh there are a lot of black
people in
sports you know Way Way Beyond the
numbers in the population do you know
why do you know why I don't about
that because every single one of them
got there on
Merit every single one of them no
exceptions I I don't think there was
ever one black guy who got into
professional sports because he was black
probably never I mean not in the modern
world
world so no how about why don't we work
on the thing that every single person
agrees on school isn't good enough it's
even worse in Black communities and if
you don't fix that nothing else matters
nothing else matters everything else
will look exactly the same
forever so I I've SED I'm sort of sort
of bowing out of the adult diversity
conversation a little bit I mean can't
get away from the entire
but if it seems so stupid to talk about
the thing you can't fix when there's a
thing you can fix that we're ignoring
and that it would fix the other thing as
well all right the latest hoax you
probably already heard it um we were
wondering what would be the summer hoax
about Trump and the summer hoax is that
he encouraged he wants to encourage
Russia to attack NATO allies who don't
pay their
bills
really now first of all did he say
that something like it yeah I mean
that's not an exact quote but he did say
that and we don't know if this really
happened he said that uh uh a member of
NATO said are you saying that if we
don't pay our bills to Nato that you
won't protect us if Russia attacks us
and Trump reportedly said as if this
conversation really happened we don't
know but he reportedly said that's right
you're on your
[Laughter]
own now is there anybody uh watching
this live stream who is so dumb that
they don't know exactly what he was
doing there is there anybody dumb enough
that I need to explain
this I'm going to act like there's
somebody dumb enough here that need to
explain
it this is called a combination of a dad
joke and really good negotiating
technique because if the NATO countries
know they'll be protected without paying
why would they
pay now of course he's supposed to say I
won't protect you if you don't pay even
if it's not true he's supposed to say I
won't protect you unless you pay that's
exactly what the president is supposed
to say and in fact we can even laugh at
you after we say it yeah yeah we're
going to let them take over your country
and turn you all into slaves oh yeah if
that's what you want but hey the other
thing you could do is just pay your
bills like everybody else but if you
don't and Russia attacks you know in
fact I think he even went further didn't
he say like he he would support Russia
attacking him or
something it was something like
ludicrous now if you don't understand
that he doesn't mean it I mean in the
real world he's going to do whatever
makes sense
always but he certainly should tell them
he won't protect them if they don't pay
their bills that's exactly what you want
your president to do and so they're
turning into he's not he's he hates
NATO now by the way he used the same
technique negotiating technique with
Putin and he brags about it that he
would uh he would nuke ma
Moscow now as Trump said well maybe
there's a 10% chance he believed it
that's all I needed I just needed to put
a little you know doubt in his mind well
that's what he's doing with the NATO
countries if if it really happened that
story you're just putting a little doubt
in their mind maybe I won't but but you
probably would protect us anyway right
maybe I won't maybe I won't that's
exactly what he should
say I I don't know how many times Trump
can do exactly the right thing and then
the Democrats will find a way to make it
sound like exactly the wrong thing not
only did he do exactly the right
thing he did it
funny that's like a home run with a
little
extra yeah a perfect a perfect
negotiating stance you pay or we won't
protect you perfect there's literally
nothing I would change about that you
you could not improve that with any
change that is
100% absolutely perfect
persuasion
so they're going to say he doesn't like
NATO so that's your hoax for the summer
the summer hoax we were we were waiting
for
it uh who's reporting it the hoax NBC
news now remember you have to know the
players it's not enough to know the
facts you have to know the players to
make it all make sense NBC
News typically understood to be a CIA
asset which is just in the propaganda
brainwashing business not really news
that's what people say I don't have
personal information about that
um but here is their headline on X
former president Donald Trump said he
would encourage Russia to quote do
whatever the hell they want if it
attacked a NATO country that didn't pay
enough for
defense referencing a conversation from
his
presidency so of course they went with
the hoax without without any reference
to the fact that it's the obvious thing
to do that it was the obvious thing to
say and it was the right thing to say
they they just report the
hoax and then the hill also reported it
similarly all right uh you remember Nate
silver nay silver was famous for being a
statistical
uh statistical uh what would you call it
I don't want to call him a genius let's
say he was famous for his statistical
takes uh but he's he's definitely a free
thinker now and he's not going to be
kind to either side if they don't
deserve it and I'm really start a guru
statistical Guru let's take that
statistical Guru I like that thank you
um but he he hits hard at both parties
now and so he's a must follow in my view
anybody who can criticize both parties
with complete full throat he he doesn't
hold back anything for either side I
just respect that even even if I don't
agree I respect it so here's what he
said about uh he said you don't
demonstrate your seriousness that Trump
is an existential threat to democracy by
going through the motions to renominate
an 81-year-old with a 38% approval
rating who 75% of Voters think is too
old without giving anyone a choice
because that's just how things are
done pretty well capsulized right there
pretty
well all right and uh Hillary Clinton
has said even even she says that age is
a legitimate issue about Biden but that
Trump is only three years
younger and that uh Trum and that Biden
is out there campaigning
vigorously
what bites out there campaigning
vigorously I don't think he's done
anything vigorously in 10
years except
lie um but this could be a ctis on the
roof situation because if Hillary
Clinton is saying that age is an issue
although she says it's for both of them
I feel like that might be
the way that the Democrats are getting
softened up you know you know even even
your most
trusted politician on the Democrat side
Hillary who we all love and respect and
you know she's a certain age herself so
you know she would know and gosh uh you
know maybe we should take seriously this
age thing yeah could be the cats on the
roof
all right ladies and gentlemen is there
any big story that I missed this
morning I realized that I stopped
reading all official news sites unless
they're linked by a post on the
xplatform so I think I might be missing
some stuff
now
uh there's a there's a Tesla S
equivalent for
29,000 well I don't know about
that
um Trump made fun of Haley's husband
really I didn't see
that uh what else we
got all right so I'm G to reiterate my
uh suggestion from the other day because
the more I thought about it the more I
liked it if you believe that George
Soros is destroying America by funding
everything bad from black lives matter
to
um you know a you know District
Attorneys um
then would it make sense for uh some
rich billionaire on the Republican side
to do investigations of everybody he
funded because I believe that everybody
in the local scene they're all corrupt I
think you could you know investigate any
mayor of a big city and you'd find
corruption I think you could investigate
basically every political member of
every big city and you would find
corruption you just have to look for it
now generally speaking I'm very much
opposed to looking for crimes you know
just like oh show me the person I'll
show you the crime it's very stalinesque
but if the country if you believe the
country is being destroyed by the
funding of you know Man's family you
should Target everybody he funds until
it's too dangerous to take his money so
if you send to let's say you send to
jail three district attorneys that were
Soros funded and you make it clear that
you're investigating all the rest of
them and you're looking you're going to
look for anything and you're going to
you're going to give them the lawfare
problems of all
time and it's completely legal
now just as it's completely legal for
George soros's foundations and families
to give money in the ways he's doing it
he seems to be doing it completely
legally it would also be completely
legal to fund somebody to investigate
using totally legal means uh the
potential Corruption of a political
figure right as long as nothing illegal
was done in the investigation it could
be just talking to people they know and
you know that sort of asking for be
paying for whistleblowers you know put
up an award how how about an award
program for
whistleblowers specifically for Soros
funded entities how about that you don't
even have to do the investigation you
can just say a million dollars for every
whistleblower that can bring down a
Soros funded um
person because you wouldn't have to do a
thousand of them you could do three of
them and the rest would
quit they'd be like I'm out I'm out yeah
we're all we're all be because as soon
as the pattern is established that
everybody Soros funds is going to be
taken down and I believe at this point
that would be a legitimate political
process that they should all be targeted
for uh elimination and I think it's just
too dangerous to live in a country where
Soros is controlling it so while I
normally would never recommend that you
target a citizen who does who has not
been you know accused of a crime by the
normal process I think this case is a
special
case I think that there's no
justification for what sorus is doing
except destruction and under that
special case I could get pretty
aggressive all right yeah I guess V uh
was invited up to give a little speech
at Trump's rally yesterday which is
causing people to imagine that VI would
be the favorite faed VP pick um I'll say
again uh anybody who's not VI is going
to look like a real mistake at this
point if aake is not
selected it's going to look like a
mistake would you
agree so and and that's different from
other years I've never said that before
I've never said that there's a mistake
you could make with the vice president
because you don't normally even think of
that as the biggest deal in the world so
normally you could get a you know Mike
Pence you could get a you know K Harris
it kind of doesn't matter that much you
know you can have your Dan quail and
still get along fine but I would
actually see if he doesn't pick V
assuming V would say yes if he doesn't
pick V that would look like just an
obvious
mistake which is not the kind of mistake
Trump
makes by the way did you hear his uh in
his introduction Trump used two
adjectives to describe the do you
remember what they
were smart was one what was the other
one young
young young and smart now those were the
first two words that came into his
mind that's what he actually thinks and
and what what would be better for
America younger
and
smarter I I would love to see Trump like
actually deal directly with the with the
the question could you have a vice
president that's that capable would you
feel comfortable with that because I
want you to see the answer and you're
going to be surprised because I think
Trump would say I actually I'm positive
like I'm just positive that Trump would
say are you kidding smarter is better
why wouldn't I smarter is better that's
the end of the
story I'm I'm sure that's that was what
he really thinks
too I do not believe that Trump is even
a little bit um threatened by super
smart people I don't think that
threatens him even a little bit I think
he just says you're on my team excellent
let's get some stuff
done all
right uh yeah the number one everybody
always says the number one qualification
for a VP is the ability to be president
they don't always pick somebody like
that but we do see that the ability to
be president is a pretty low bar at the
moment let me ask you this is there
anybody watching this now that you see
that Biden is actually the president is
there anybody who thinks they couldn't
do the
job like you
personally oh you think he couldn't do
the job so you think you couldn't do as
well as Joe Biden is doing right now
does anybody believe
that I spent most of my life thinking I
would could never be capable to be a
president you know who ruined it for me
Bill
Clinton I used to think I was smart
enough to be a president until I saw
Bill
Clinton and every time I watch that guy
no matter what you think of his politics
every time I watched him I I would say
to myself okay I'm not that
smart how does he remember all those
leaders
names so to me it was obvious that he
was just extra and I think Obama is
crazy smart too you know even if you
don't like him he's crazy smart but you
know Reagan you know when I watched the
old Reagan uh videos I've watched a few
recently I I was much younger when
Reagan was President so I'm not sure I
was paying attention too
much uh my take on Reagan he's way
smarter than he was given credit for has
anybody had that has anybody had that
realization I I swear I spent all the
time he was President I Bel I believe
the narrative that he was not that smart
but then you see him talk and I'd
forgotten you know how good he was he
was a great communicator but you forget
you forget how good it is when you
actually watch it again with the let's
say with the perspective of time and you
see what our current leaders do and then
you see what he was doing and then they
called him the dumb
guy he looked really smart in a in a
practical way that you know matters more
than the anything
else so that's all I got for today
thanks for joining on the X and Rumble
and YouTube platforms another great show
I'm sure you'll agree things my smart
Democrat friend will never know and
never see and we'll be back tomorrow
join us son thanks for
coming
