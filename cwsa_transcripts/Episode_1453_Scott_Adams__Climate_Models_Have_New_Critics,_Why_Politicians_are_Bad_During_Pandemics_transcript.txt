yes
this little piece of paper is what i
read every time it's got the
simultaneous sip language on it
yeah yeah i know just about anybody in
the world would have memorized this by
now i say it every day
but for some reason i can't i don't know
my brain doesn't work that way
if it's written down i won't i won't
memorize it
and all you need to make your day better
here i can make that better there you go
there's a copper margaret glass a tanker
chelsea style canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine here of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous
sip go
ah yes all right so first of all
youtubers we got cut off yesterday and i
didn't know why
uh the answer is my device so i had some
kind of a wi-fi
bug that knocked me off on my ipad
but if it happens again the problem is
me
not youtube i have new new hardware for
tomorrow so we'll
you'll see a different look tomorrow if
you don't want the ads
you can go over to the locals platform
which today i've unlocked
so that you could watch it without a
subscription so just the
that part of the content my other
content
the provocative stuff you would still
need a subscription for that
all right uh
oh okay thought i had a problem here but
i don't
life is good so
did you see uh did you see that uh
mike lindell pulled his my pillow ads
from fox
how does fox even survive without the my
pillow
ads that's that's pretty big part
and part of it is and the reason he
pulled his ads is he wanted to do
something i guess about the election and
fox news didn't want that one on there
and so mike lindell pulled it all
and it should be noted that mike lindell
stuck with
fox news when let's say uh
tucker carlson was getting a lot of heat
michael and dell stuck with him
but uh didn't work the other way i'm not
saying you should
i'm just noting that there was uh the
reciprocity was not
complete although the situations are
different to be fair
there's no reason to assume there would
be reciprocity but you can see why mike
lindell might have said you know
i was loyal to you and you weren't loyal
to me
you may be thinking along those lines
the other possibility is that the
business isn't doing that well
because he's getting so much heat
because the election stuff
i don't know how many pillows he's
selling them that had to
have some kind of an effect so it could
be that his advertising budget isn't as
much as it used to be either
but on the other hand that's the only
way he sells pillows right
unless people just buy them off the
shelf these days
so that's something to watch because
as advertisers are affected by
the news and the issues i don't maybe
the whole advertising model of news
can't last it's going to be all
pharmaceuticals all the time
all right um representative
madeleine dean is very mad at
the insurrection deniers so
the republicans apparently the
republicans like to say things like
well that thing you call an insurrection
was just p
people walking around peacefully and
taking pictures
now that's such a lie
why would you say that now
that's close to something that is true
what's close to something that's true is
that almost everybody there was
non-violent
and they didn't really have heavy
weaponry but
obviously it was seriously violent in
some places the the fact that you know
98
of them had nothing to do with violence
doesn't change the fact it was a violent
day and all that was bad
so here's a suggestion to the
republicans
you look like idiots when you say it was
peaceful you just look like
idiots because a hundred percent of the
world knows it wasn't peaceful
why would you say that it's just it's
such a bad way to persuade
you have to tell people the thing that's
obvious before you start
it's obvious horrible things happened
let's stipulate that horrible things
happened
and now make your point that 98 of them
blah blah blah were peaceful obviously
it wasn't an insurrection because they
didn't bring the kind of weapons or any
kind of assets that would make that
happen
it was just a protest now you could
definitely make the cases just a protest
and that well not just a protest but
that part of it got violent but why
would you
why would you be so ridiculous to
categorize
to try to categorize the whole thing as
peaceful i mean that's just so dumb
it's so dumb don't do that
all right here's one of those goals
versus systems
situation and i feel like we're
the public and and uh that would include
most of you
i think we're stuck in a little weird
trap with the pandemic
and the trap is that we
manage to what is measured this is one
of the most
important uh understandings of the world
that you will ever have and it's
something you don't get when you're a
teenager it takes it takes like a long
time to figure out how the world really
works
and one of the ways that the world
really works
is that we manage to statistics
so if something can be measured that's
what we're going to manage to
because there's going to be somebody
elected or hired whose job it is to
manage to that thing
it's the only thing we're measuring so
make sure this goes up and this goes
down that's your job
so how do you how do you measure in the
context of the pandemic
if you're a politician how do you
measure people being happier
you don't do it i mean there might be
polls about people being happier but no
no politician manages to that right
but what do you care about if i ask you
what do you care about you'd say well
being happy
being free like being able to make my
own choices
but where's the measurement for those
things
how where's your measurement of freedom
it's not measured where's your
measurement of happiness
it's not measured right so the things
you want
don't have numbers associated with them
because you couldn't
but the things that the politicians will
be
judged on are the stuff you can measure
deaths during their term
that's basically it right i mean
infections too
i mean that's going to look bad if
everything's spiking
but mostly deaths and
what is different between politicians
and the public
what is the public saying consistently
pretty much all of us pretty much all of
the public
is saying some version of we know it's
dangerous
we know it we want to do it anyway
yeah we've assessed the risks thank you
very much
you know the government is actually
pretty good at at least trying to get
you information you know at least
pushing the right buttons you don't get
the right information all the time but
at least they're trying and it's the
right entity to do it
so i think we have to look at the fact
that our goal of getting past the
pandemic
doesn't look the same if you're a
politician or you're the public
and that's a big freaking problem
because the politicians are in charge of
fixing this thing
or getting us past the pandemic and they
don't have the same incentives
that we do that's the worst possible
situation
what could be worse than your leaders
having a different motivation
than the people they're leading it that
doesn't get worse that's the worst
system you could devise
is that the people and the leaders are
on a different page and that's what we
have
and it's because some things are
measurable and some things aren't
now do you think we should build a
pandemic policy around things that just
coincidentally are things you can
measure sort of and you're not even sure
about that
that's that's what we got let me suggest
a different system which is sort of
self-organizing
as we speak it has to do with let's just
take the one example of mass
mandates coming back on now i think we
all understand
why the politicians want the mass
commandants
the delta variant is super bad and it's
infecting people even vaccinated people
and then they can give it to other
people
even if they don't have a big problem
themselves they can spread it
blah blah so we all understand why
but would you make the same choice the
politicians are making
no no you wouldn't you would you would
probably say yeah i get everything
you're saying
i hear everything you've told me i
understand it
and i think i still don't want to wear
my mask because i want to take that
chance
i feel as though the system that's
emerging
is that let me put a number on it
i think that mask mandates work when
99 of the public or more
complies just based on the sign
just the sign alone you walk up to a
business you see the sign
99 of you put on your masks
if that's not the case and it's only
let's say
ninety percent what happens if only
ninety percent
put on their mask to enter that store
even though the
sign on the door says put on your mask
what happens if it what happens if it's
only 90
well the store owners have a big problem
right
they either have to spend all their time
getting that 10
to put on their masks or they ignore it
what are they going to do you're at
mcdonald's
i'll just pick a random business you go
into mcdonald's without your mask
even though the door says you got to
wear a mask
the manager says oh could you please
wear a mask you know we require them
you say oh okay um yeah i
i thought i could eat here without a
mask but i'll eat somewhere else
they don't care that much but then then
you say
oh okay or let's say ultimately say oh
okay i didn't didn't realize that you
would need a mask
for fully vaccinated people but i'm
happy to comply
so you put on your mask you order your
food and then you take your mask off to
eat it
right but you have caused their staff
to do something that's not related to
their main job
how many people go through mcdonald's
every day
if one in ten comes in and causes a
problem
the whole operation doesn't work you
know mcdonald's is a well-oiled machine
but even that doesn't work
if they have to tell 10 every 10th
person they have to have a conversation
with them
the whole the whole system shuts down so
here's what i see emerging
when things were less less certain and
people were less vaccinated
listening to your government about what
to do medically to keep yourself safe
pretty rational i'd say that was
rational but once you realize that your
government's incentive
has sort of veered away from your
incentive
or how you would like to live your life
the freedom the risk you'd like to put
into it
i think the i think the public's in
charge now
i believe that i believe that authority
is being transferred accidentally
from leaders elected leaders to the
public
and i believe that with this second
round of
masked mandates i don't think the
leaders are in charge
or should be or should be
right i believe this decision will be
the publix
the public last times 99 point whatever
percent of us
said all right all right we hate masks
but it looks temporary
it looks well considered and we think
that the people who are recommending it
are on our side that was all true don't
you think
the people recommending it were for the
most part on your side
doing the best they could look temporary
perfectly reasonable even if you hated
it
it was reasonable i thought right
reasonable enough so you comply even if
you
didn't think it was reasonable it was
close enough right
but i don't know about the second wave
if
mass mandates come back i feel as if
you're going to get at least 10 percent
who just say well let's see what happens
every time i go into a store
without one just see what happens
and let them take you out be polite
about it
because the people working at the store
they didn't cause you any problem
like they're just citizens they're just
trying to get through the day
so don't you know don't be an to
whoever works or owns the store
or the place you're going to i mean
please we don't need that
right but you can certainly assert your
preference
and politely put on your mask or leave
when asked
it would probably stop the whole system
so
i think you're going to see the
public take control of this decision
i think that's what's going to happen
all right
but suppose you wanted to change the
system
so that the leaders could do what you
wanted them to do
how about the leaders just said all
right the only thing we're going to
measure
is hospital capacity
as long as the hospital capacity is fine
you can all make up your own decisions
would that politician get re-elected
probably not because then because then
the other side would say well you don't
care about deaths and look at how many
people you killed by being irresponsible
they would actually have a number for
how many people you killed so you need
some kind of a system
that recognizes that in this case the
public
needs to sort of make the decision so
maybe you make it based on polls
how about you say uh you know if you
were a politician suppose you said
look if 75 of the public wants no masks
i'll support that if 75 of the public
says no masks
on let's say whatever poll you think is
credible
that you'll you'll agree
would you support a politician who said
look
if you go your way with no mass more
people will die
i believe more people will die but you
will all live free
and you all know you risk so i'm going
to go with you i'll go with the public
what would you say about that and
suppose your politician said
look i'm going to work with the the
medical people and the mental health
people
and and the experts i can we're going to
pick a number
and when 75 of the public just to pick a
random number
when 75 of the public says no masks
and that you prefer that risk you prefer
that risk
i'll agree with you so and i would just
throw it back to the public and say and
by the way this is something trump could
do
that nobody else could do name one
person who could do this
trump could stand in front of the world
and say look
you know we got the medical
considerations we've got the freedom the
psychological considerations
the public you know the the president
doesn't need to tell you what to do all
the time
sometimes you tell me what to do so
public
we're going to start pulling the
out of you when you get to 75
no masks that's it that's it that'll be
the decision
you make the decision this time we made
the decision last time
because that made sense but it doesn't
make sense this time
i feel like the public has enough of a
sense of the risk
that uh that we could handle this
somebody says polls don't work well you
know nothing works perfectly
but you have a choice of things that
don't work perfectly i mean
you can't get away from that uh
manufacturing consensus
yeah it would be somewhat manufactured
because you'd have the different
the different entities deciding you know
the public debate
and the the influential people would
have more influence
right the persuasive people would have a
bigger impact
but i still think it's a better system
because the public would say
okay we listen to the medical experts we
made our decision
democracy sometimes it works
rasmussen did a poll on asking people to
rate
congress now as you know congress does
not have a high
rating for good job uh
but i didn't know it was this bad
how many think how many people in the
poll
the rasmussen poll said that congress is
doing an
excellent job excellent
five percent five percent i thought they
were excellent
how many thought they were at least well
good you're good
12 so 17
thought uh good or uh excellent
and i think they were like i didn't
write this one down but it was like
four percent or something um thought
didn't have an opinion
who doesn't have an opinion on congress
i guess there's somebody
but if you add together the 17 and say
the 4 percent
who just don't have an opinion you get
about 21
who answer this poll who are just
 idiots
consistent right around 20
of the public are idiots
on any question and you know it's
between 20 and 30 but i used 25 as my
as my anchor point there so
uh 25 said they're doing a fair job and
54 said poor can you think of any other
job you can keep
when 54 of the public think you're doing
a bad job
can you is there anything else and again
it's a system problem isn't it the
system
problem is that everybody likes their
own representative
but they hate yours
and we all get to vote on everybody
else's representative
so you have a system which guarantees a
low
rating because your you're ranking the
other person's representative not your
own
um let's talk about climate models
uh michael schellenberger was tweeting
this this morning
that apparently there's a new group of
critics
for the climate models so they're the
people who make the
the models they're involved in that kind
of work
so they make the models and in the past
there were a lot of critics
of the models for example a lot of
people on the right
mostly mostly people on the right and
people like me
um i don't i don't align with the right
um
on my own thing but um i've been a big
critic
of the models but now there is a new
group of critics of the models
and that includes the people who make
the models
so the people who make the models are
having trouble agreeing
on what assumptions should go into the
models so much so
that it would wildly change the outcome
now aren't you confused
because is science
dull and if it's science
how could there be disagreement and
climate science is all settled and all
dull well as
a hundred percent of people who have
ever worked with any kind of models
that are iterative over time where any
small change in the assumptions
wildly changes the outcome in you know
year 10 and certainly in the year 80.
anybody who's ever done that work and i
have i've done a lot of that work
of modeling you know it's
everybody who's done modeling knows
models are
unfortunately i mean i had a job for
years that was
more than than useful so that
wasn't awesome
but at least i learned something i
learned that models are
basically based on the assumption so
now we know that there's a little bit
more disagreement on the models
but before you get all happy
because you're let's say you're a
climate change
denier type before you get all happy
all of the models still say we got a big
problem
right so when i say that the people who
make the models
are arguing against the models too keep
in mind that all of the models
say things are bad or that the earth is
warming because of
human involvement so there's nobody who
says oh
everything's fine at least within the
you know the main
credible model making world now does
that mean that they're all right
i don't know i mean i
my personal belief is that the uh
the people who say that adding a certain
chemical to the atmosphere should cause
a certain
effect are probably right but the
estimating exactly how that goes and
then especially
estimating how humans respond to it
totally unpredictable so dave rubin's
twitter account got limited by
twitter so here here's why his account
got limited and i guess that just means
he can't tweet for a while or
i think that's what it means um
so he's he's not kicked off he's just
limited for a while
and here's what he got limited for
saying that the vaccine the vaccinations
are not working
as promised so maybe we should take a
step back and look at our strategy
and he got limited on twitter for that
what what
i what he just what he said and what i
paraphrased is what all of science
believes
he agreed with science he agreed with
everybody is there anybody who disagrees
with the statement
that the vaccinations did not work the
way
you know you could say promised or
expected
does anybody believe they worked the way
they were expected
who was it who thought that you would
need more booster shots
i don't remember anybody talking about
that i mean it was always in the wind
but it wasn't really a topic
how many people knew that you could get
vaccinated
and still many many people could get the
effect
the actual infection and also spread it
you'd have a high viral load
how many people knew that i mean i
suppose
experts probably thought somebody says i
knew
okay you knew somebody on youtube is
like i knew
you didn't know anything you may have
suspected but you didn't know
anything but i like your confidence
um so
wouldn't the entire medical community
and the scientific community say yes
we thought the we thought the
vaccinations would
pretty much prevent you from getting it
and
would probably not need a booster i
think those are important
and safe accurate things
and so dave rubin says that given that
you didn't get what you thought you were
getting
should you pause and consider your
entire strategy
essentially the same thing i said
earlier in this live stream
which is you know maybe the
experts and the strategy or around of
alignment
how do you get how does anybody look at
that
and tell him that that wasn't a
legitimate thing to say
now yeah you could disagree with it
that's what opinions are right
but he didn't say anything that's
inaccurate
it was just the most not only is it
accurate it is the least
provocative thing you could possibly say
because everybody agrees with this
statement
everybody everybody agrees
that if there's new data you should
maybe reconsider your strategy
everybody like i don't know how to say
that stronger everybody says that's
right
and everybody agrees that the
vaccinations weren't quite what we
thought
and everybody agrees that when the when
the information changes
the most rational thing anybody can do
is take a step back
and say all right did that change what
our strategy is
how the hell do you get suspended for
that
good lord now
let me be a little bit charitable to
twitter i assume that the people who are
monitoring activity and making decisions
like this
you know they're not your your high-end
executives right
it's people who are getting paid a
certain amount of money
dealing with a large volume of stuff but
when you see somebody who's a high
visibility account
like dave rubin i feel like that one
should have gotten kicked upstairs don't
you think
i don't think that any decision about
his account
i mean if you're a blue check you've got
a certain visibility in the world
i feel like that just has to go through
management like so
to twitter let me suggest
that for the larger accounts if you
don't have this system in place already
i would recommend that you have a system
of just for the larger accounts
give them a second look you know get a
get a supervisor involved
because i don't know that you could get
two people to ban this account or
to limit it i just don't know the two
people sitting there and looking at it
carefully would have the same outcome
it looks like one person made a bad
decision so
consider your systems twitter there
might be a
hiccup in the system all right so
you know i told you that if mass
compliance lo
goes down to 90 just picking a random
number there
probably that will be such a problem for
the system that mask
mandates just won't work well we're
going to see a little leadership
happening in the house
of representatives because dozens of
house republicans and staffers they
took off their mass or didn't have them
in the first place and marched to the
senate floor to protest
the mask mandates so it looks like
some republicans are going to go first
now would it be easier for the public to
ignore mass
mandates if they saw their elected
representative
elective representatives doing it it
might
so this is the weird thing about
leadership
when you hear the word leadership don't
automatically think it's good
right leadership doesn't mean good
it just means leadership because you
could lead somebody
to you know the holocaust or you could
lead them to
peace i mean you could lead somebody
anywhere so leadership is not good or
bad
well usually it's evil in my opinion but
doesn't have to be
and here's an example um is it right or
is it wrong
for for the house republicans to
encourage people to not wear masks
if they're vaccinated is that good or
bad
i don't know i don't know i mean
it's one of those things that could turn
out either way and you could evaluate it
either way maybe extra people will die
well that's bad maybe they give us our
freedom back
at the risk of some risk of death well
maybe that's good
i'd like a little more freedom even at
the risk of death
so i don't i don't think you need to
have an opinion on whether it's good
or bad to still applaud them this is
actual leadership
you know you elect these people
to you know to express the will of the
people
most of the time but sometimes they have
to lead
that's an expectation and so i would say
to the republicans who
stage this protest good leadership
even if it's the wrong thing right in
the end we're sort of guessing
and we have different priorities perhaps
but good leadership
i would say whoever was involved in that
give yourself a pat in the back for not
being a sheep
even if you're wrong even if you're
wrong
um so
here's my take on things and i wonder if
anybody will ever
say this in public in terms of
politicians will they ever say this in
politic
in public hasn't our
um path out of the pandemic
it's different now right i believe we
had a path out of the pandemic or
thought we did
mistakenly we thought we did earlier on
in which it was you're you're going to
get
hurt immunity and then you'd be done
and the herd immunity would be some
combination of infected people
plus vaccinations but that's not
possible now right
when do you say that the delta variant
along with the fact that vaccinated
people
can still carry it quite easily it seems
doesn't that change the strategy from
trying to get to herd immunity and then
being done
i don't think we can isn't it a
foregone conclusion given current
information
not not a year ago but current
information
isn't it a foregone conclusion that
we're basically all going to get the
virus
and that the only thing that matters is
how sick you got
or if he died so it seems to me that we
need
a leader who can tell us the truth
i think the truth is that
we all have to get the virus or else
it's perpetual
we either live like this forever and
that's unsustainable
or we get as many people as possible
both vaccinated
and also infected because if you're
vaccinated first and then infected
you're
almost certainly not going to die so
and then you know enough to keep our
keeper hospitals running the reason for
both
is that until the vaccinated people also
get infected
they're almost certainly going to be
spreaders
so correct me if i'm wrong but a
vaccinated person can spread very easily
a person who's recovered will it'll
never take hold
in a way or rarely will take hold in a
way that you could be a spreader
so there are two things you're trying to
stop one is the spreading
which the vaccinations don't do enough
of stopping the spread
but being infected does i think now give
me a fact check on that but i think
that's the case
so and and by the way uh
i also think um based on
freedom and free will and choice and all
that that if there's some people who
don't want to get vaccinated
and they're fully aware of their options
and their choices
that's fine but at least your strategy
would be the same
your strategy would be to get as many
people both vaccinated
and infected the people who don't get
vaccinated will just get infected
so that's a strategy too so
um am i wrong let me look in the
comments am i
am i analyzing this incorrectly
check my assumptions assumption number
one
since the vaccinations do not stop
infections
and the delta variant is just crazy
we're all going to get it this year next
year five years from now
right you see somebody saying you are
wrong well
just tell me which assumption i'm wrong
on or
if the logic is wrong so i've got some
assumptions and i've got some logic
um tell me if either of those look wrong
to you
we need therapeutics in every situation
yes
herd immunity doesn't resolve
individuals i don't know what that means
uh our reputation leading to new
variants oh
so the let's make an assumption about
new variants
new variants are coming no matter what
right is there anybody thinks that the
variance won't
won't happen no matter what so i don't
know if
the vaccinations make more variants but
i don't see any other way to get there
yeah there's no way to tell well yeah
that's true
is the spanish flu still around the
spanish flu
burned itself out in two seasons
i think uh but i don't think that this
one has the same characteristics as the
spanish flu so
i'd be careful about comparing them
yeah and then there's the idea that the
vaccinations by their nature
might create variants but i think we're
already past
that in other words there are so many
people vaccinated already
that if what you're worrying about is
that the vaccinated create variants
we're already there
um spanish flu didn't have the internet
yeah that's true
and getting value somebody says getting
vaccinated during a pandemic
creates the variance well do we know if
the delta variant came from
a vaccinated person or an unvaccinated
do we even know that the delta variant
is a variant
that came from the natural spread
or was it just a different virus
can anybody tell me that we know for
sure
that something is a variant versus
something that was a variant in the lab
are you telling me that there couldn't
have been a second coronavirus escape
i mean i don't think they would have
escaped at the same time because the
delta variant would have been the
dominant one from the start but
i don't see anything that would stop a
second league
later especially if it was intentional
which i'm not alleging i'm just saying
you have to consider all possibilities
so somebody says delta is a variant from
the original
but that could be in the lab as well you
could make a
you could make the variant in a lab
it doesn't have to have to happen in
nature does it
um
so somebody says if you discussed the
election audits this deeply
you would have a different position that
could be true
but let me uh reiterate my
my belief on the audits
which is if they found the goods you
would already know it
let's take arizona as my example and i'm
going to stick by that
because i find that that kind of
prediction
to be really accurate meaning that
the you know making a prediction based
on you would have had a leak by now
is really it really works so
even though you're maybe common sense
is telling you no scott there's so much
smoke
i mean there's smoke all over the place
we've heard so many things
that suggest that there's a problem
there's so many
so many and from credible people too
right
but you haven't heard anything like from
the actual audit
that you know was official enough that
got leaked
and i'm positive you would have heard
that by now i'm
positive i think where it's going to end
up is two movies
easiest prediction in the world is that
when the audit
results come out there'll be some
ambiguity about maybe
chain of custody or whatever and people
who believe there was a problem will say
well it's been proven
by the audit and the people who don't
think there's a problem will say well
look all they found was some ambiguous
thing they didn't actually find a
problem
it's going to be two two screens there's
no
i don't think the odds of a uh an
audit producing a kill shot you know
that just says whoa
the whole election definitely was
fraudulent
i will put the odds of that at i don't
know
five percent maybe and that assumes that
there's
there's fraud like you know that that
makes a big assumption that i don't
think is
uh necessarily supported by the data
um so why were you blocking it
i don't know what you're talking about
uh
[Music]
so what do you what are you going to do
if the fda
approves the vaccinations through the
normal process
i see a ton of people saying that
one of the one of the reasons they don't
want to take the vaccinations is that
they didn't go through the normal fda
process what if they do what if a month
from now
or whatever um
you i'm just looking at
a comment here
you know a lot of people are just
terrible people aren't they
like you you see some comments going by
and you say to yourself
my god i'm glad i don't know that person
in the real world
i mean just just horrible people
i mean i know i see some of the comments
i don't think i can respect you less
based on most of you of course i love
but yeah i'll tell you the comment that
triggered me
somebody's saying that i said i left the
house twice during the pandemic
and therefore i'm not a hermit what i
said was
i traveled more miles during the
pandemic than any other year of my life
does that sound the same does that sound
the same as left the house twice
no i traveled more outside my house
than any time in my life
and and so this guy wants to call me out
on that
um
oh i i think i'm i'm triggered by
people who misstate things about me in
public
and then present their opinion based on
their misstatement
it's just really annoying if you're a
public figure
because if you think about it aren't
there legitimate things to
criticize me for if you look at all the
things i've said and done
even today seriously you can't find a
real thing to criticize me for
even i could criticize me like i like me
and i agree with all of my opinions and
even i could find things to criticize
about me real things like real
objectively obvious real things
why do you why do you have to make
up if you want to criticize me
go wild i'm okay with that but criticize
something that's a little bit real
just a little bit why the do you
have to make up
all right um
giving cuomo a pass for mass murder is
something i criticize
you for fair how fair is that good
example
now there's a person who is not an
that's just a completely legitimate
criticism
that i said in the beginning of the
pandemic
that people were going to make big
mistakes it was because this fog of war
and mostly people are guessing
and that we should be somewhat generous
after the fact because we're asking our
leaders basically to go into the
machine gun nest and when you ask
somebody to go into the machine gun nest
i feel like you got to be a little bit
more forgiving about
how they do it you know so
yes it was a gigantic mistake
yes it was a gigantic tragedy yes it
should never have happened
but i'm going to be consistent
if trump had done it i'd be saying the
same thing
the fact that cuomo did it and he's an
enemy of trump doesn't change the fact
i would say the same damn thing if it
had been trump
so at least i'm consistent but
those of you who are criticizing it
totally fair
because you're looking at the same facts
you're not making anything up
it's just an opinion and that's fair
um are you paid to soft sell
vaccines that's a good question
wouldn't you say so uh first of all
am i am i soft-selling vaccines
i would say that that observation is
correct
that's correct what's not true
is that it's my intention now that part
you can't check right because that's
something happening in my head
you also couldn't know if somebody had
secretly paid me to influence
i definitely would not take money from a
pharmaceutical
to influence anybody that would be
i mean i almost can't think of anything
less ethical than that
i mean that would be so deeply immoral
uh that let me say it directly no
i don't take money from pharmaceuticals
i don't take actually any
let me make sure that i'm not lying but
in terms of the live stream i don't take
any advertising
from anybody directly it's all just
stuff that goes through the system
you know youtube decides what ads are on
there
so i don't take any money for that for
live streaming or let me be less
specific i don't take any money from any
pharmaceuticals for anything
period and neither has the government
asked me to persuade
now if this had been
the trump administration i guarantee
that somebody in the administration
would have reached out and asked
me to persuade i guarantee it
but under the biden administration now
nobody nobody's reached out to me
nobody's asked for that
so i give you uh i tell you my
experience and i tell you what i think
is true and not true
as best i can determine it and i help
you think about it
now because this is the real world
talking honestly and usefully about any
topic
is likely to cause you to be influenced
because things do have a natural a more
natural right and wrong
lots of times right sometimes things are
you know just a toss up
but i feel like the vaccination thing
leans towards vaccination
just an opinion now if talking about it
objectively gets you to that same
opinion
which by the way remember remember the
recording that i like to run in my head
the recording i run in my head in
situations like this where you can't
really know how things are going to turn
out
but the recording is but i could be
wrong and
easily like if you ask me what is your
level of confidence that getting the
vaccine was the right decision
i'd say more than 50
but not 99 yeah
definitely not 99 but
you have to make a decision right not
getting a vac seen as a decision
with a whole bunch of unknowns getting a
vaccination is a decision
with a whole bunch of unknowns and you
don't know which of those unknowns is
bigger
for you i mean you could know
statistically but it doesn't apply to
you
you're not a statistic so given that you
can't know
what's the right decision for you i
don't think i should
influence you should i
but you also can't turn it off if you're
let's say you're a character in the real
world
and you're you're living in the real
world you're saying real things about
real things
it's going to influence somebody that's
the kind of influence that i think
is ethical because it's just you
speaking your opinion and
not intending to persuade
um adam says
that i make you feel like you're talking
to a friend in the living room
so i don't know if you know this but
that's exactly what i'm trying to do
so i try to do this live stream so it's
not a
production it just feels like you're
talking to somebody familiar
on topics you're interested in ideally
scott do you purposely avoid oh here's a
good question
avoid drilling too deeply on a topic if
it would reverse the point you're trying
to persuade
no and you i thought that was going
to be a good question
but it was just an accusation basically
no i don't avoid looking into the
details
because i'm worried it will change my
opinion
i like having my opinion changed
you know my sort of unique place that i
feel in the media landscape
i have an advantage that other people
don't which is that i can be
spectacularly wrong and just turn it
into entertainment
i don't have to turn it into votes so
what would be more entertaining
than finding out something i was dead
certain about is wrong
i would be entertained by that i would
be totally entertained by that
and i would definitely hope that you
would too because since
since my major theme is the let's say
the
vulnerability of psychology the fact
that you can be
you can be a smart well-informed person
and totally bamboozled
by you know fake impressions and fake
news and bad analysis and all that
it it's part of my core philosophy that
i can be completely wrong
about things i'm really really sure
about and that to me is the
basic nature of reality is that people
being wrong about things they're sure
about
so in my specific case being
spectacularly wrong about something
doesn't hurt me
and i'd argue it helps me because it's
on brand
it would be exactly what i tell you is
true that even people like me
who look into stuff you know at least
more than most people i would say the
average
and i figure i'm educated and reasonably
smart
how wrong can i be about obvious stuff
that i think i'm really right about
really wrong really wrong but i would
want you to see that i wouldn't want to
hide it i wouldn't want to hide it from
you
do you think engaging more with youtube
comments is
versus locals is bad persuasion for
gaining local subscribers
well i like that you're competitive so
i've got two live streams going here
youtube and then subscription service
and
i get comments on both yeah
and but i do spend more time on the
local stuff before and after
all right um and but i also noticed that
the
locals people are a little more likely
to agree with me
you know which is no surprise they're
subscribers uh and the youtube people
are more provocative
they're they're more idiots on youtube
sorry youtube
but it's true there there's a pretty
high
high percentage of idiots in the
comments on youtube compared to locals
locals tends to be more civilized
uh that has to do with the fact that
people you know are paying to be there
all right um and that
is all we've got today and i'll talk to
you
oh wait i want to see this comment
before i go it's not about your opinion
it's about the point you're trying to
persuade others
i don't know what that means okay see
you later
