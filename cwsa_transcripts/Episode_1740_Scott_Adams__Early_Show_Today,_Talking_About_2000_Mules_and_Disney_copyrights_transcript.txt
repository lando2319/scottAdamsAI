good morning everybody it's a early show
today
it's a travel day for me i'm gonna go
take a week and just write on my new
book
i'm gonna go where the scenery is better
to my top secret location
uh you'll watch on youtube later okay
so we'll be at a different time today
and all you need to make this special is
a copper margaret glassette tanker
chelsea signed a canteen jogger flask
vessel vatican and fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopey the other day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
i might be a little quick today because
i gotta get ready
go
all right you early birds
you are the birds who always get that
worm because you're up early
sorry messing with your schedule it's
only today only today all right i tried
out my new technique technique
of when somebody responds to my tweets
with a personal attack on me
instead of responding to the personal
attack which is a habit
bad habit that i have developed
because sometimes it's funny and
sometimes
it's just work
uh so i just call everybody who does
that keith olbermann
and i just say okay keith and i tried it
out today and it took
a personal attack and just turned it
into confusion
and i thought well that's an upgrade
somebody was attacking me personally and
i said
okay keith
and the person said who's keith
defused the entire thing so try it
if we could make keith old berman a joke
i mean
more than keith olbermann has already
made himself a joke
then we should do it
so
so remember
okay keith
all right here's the dad joke of the day
you ready dad joke of the day from
twitter user frank scaramello
talking about the kentucky kentucky
derby winner did you see the video of
the kentucky derby
and the horse called rich strike
coming from behind and winning at the
last minute
now let me tell you that your first
thought is i could not be less
interested in horse racing
right
i mean i've never watched a horse race
like a complete horse race uh just for
fun i've never watched one
but
the video of this horse an 80 to one
shot coming from the back of the pack in
the kentucky derby and and winning it
all
was really breathtaking it was really
fun to watch and i have lots of
questions
like my question is
could that horse always do that
what's up with that
like why did that one horse have that
amazing one day
was it that the
a better
better jockey
was it somebody says drugs but i think
they test for that
i don't know
so
it was amazing anyway here's the joke uh
from frank scaramuela he says breaking
kentucky derby winner rich strike turns
down a meeting with joe biden
asked why they said if i wanted to see a
horse's ass i would have come in second
not bad
not bad good dad joke
all right
my twitter growth has slipped back to
baseline levels
do you remember when we all thought that
the algorithm had changed
and now all the conservative accounts
were gonna have a lot of uptick because
they did for a while
well that uptick is over
does anybody else have the same
experience
that you were getting tons of users for
like two weeks and then boop back to
normal
because that was my experience so
remember elon musk his opinion of why
the
follower account went up
is just because
twitter was in the news and
musk was trying to buy it
and it looks like maybe that was the
reason
so i think maybe the most obvious reason
is the reason
he got a lot of attention people said
hey we can go back now see what all all
the noise is about
and then they were done
so so probably it wasn't so much about
twitter you know trying to burn the
records and change the algorithms before
elon musk found out what they were up to
probably wasn't that
it probably was just they got a lot of
attention and that's all it was
well i got there was a hit piece on me
put together by some group called lgbtq
nations
and they're quite quite angry
about my treatment of the trans
community
in my comic in which the trans community
was not mentioned directly or indirectly
or even contemplated in any way by the
person who wrote it
but they're quite mad
and so this article accused me of three
things
one being a right winger
incorrect
i've left a burning
two making a trans joke incorrect it was
a joke about a guy named dave who is
black and an engineer had nothing to do
with trans whatsoever
not even a little not slightly not
glancing
not indirectly not
not in any way
but they're pretty bad
because they just saw themselves
now remember this story will you
because in a moment i'm going to tell
you a unrelated story
that connects to this story in such a
clean way it's going to amaze you
right it's just a coincidence these two
stories happened at the same time but
just remember this story
that
that people were that this group
were absolutely sure that this was all
about them
my joke and it was nothing about them
nothing at all not even slightly not and
i don't know maybe maybe some people
don't believe me maybe you think maybe
you think cleverly in my mind it really
was about them no no
not not cleverly in my mind not in the
back of my mind not my subconscious it
just was nothing about them
and yet they believed it was about them
who does that
what kind of person does that
there's nothing about them but they
think it's all about them
hold that thought
hold that thought
we'll get back to it
they also said in their article they
just threw this in that in one of my
prior tweets i had insulted
pete butterjudge and suggested that he
liked to touch young children
and then they showed my tweet
that didn't do anything like that
so they actually showed my tweet
that clearly debunked
what they said about the tweet it was
like they said
you're saying that
snow is purple and then they show the
tweet that says
i say snow is white
and then they say see
what's that
what is that i don't even know what that
is
how do you even explain that
i mean they show their work and the work
clearly shows the opposite of what they
say is yes
i don't even know how to i don't even
know how to interpret that
behold this thought it's gonna it's
gonna circle back
and then uh when i responded to it
telling them that every single fact in
it was
was literally and obviously incorrect
what do you think they did
apparently and i don't know the details
there's some way that you can use an ad
sign and you delete your tweet and then
you repost it
and somehow it doesn't show up in your
timeline but it's still searchable
somehow they managed to take down my
comment that their tweet was completely
wrong in every factual way
and they got to retweet it without my
comment
and somehow cleverly made my comment
disappear from connection to the tweet
now do you think it's because they felt
they were right
no
no they disconnected my comment from
their tweet because i'm the one who
knows what's right
obviously i know if i'm a right winger
right i know what i was thinking when i
made the comic
like i don't have to wonder
i'm the one who knows so they took the
only person who knows the actual reality
of it and they
dismissed me from the conversation
does that make them look guilty
a little bit
hold that thought hold that thought
the people trying to suppress your
thought without a counter argument
that looks pretty guilty doesn't it
that topic's going to come back around
you just wait for it
all right
the other thing that people kept asking
me when i said i'm not a right-winger
people say what do you ever disagree
with conservatives give me one example
scott
give me one example where you disagree
with conservatives to which my answer is
 you i'm not your bookkeeper i'm not
it's not my job to go
go figure out everything i've said and
present it to you in a nice form
if you wonder what my opinion is just
 ask me i'll tell you you don't
have to look at three things i've done
and a fifty thousand and for an opinion
and you don't need to tell me to go back
and research my entire life to tell you
who i am
you can just ask me
just ask i'll tell you
you don't have to do the research at all
i'll just tell you
and yeah there are plenty of people
who've watched so much of my content
that they can confirm it so just ask
anybody who's watched me for years
to confirm that's all
all right here's an example of me
criticizing conservative
opinion i guess so
uh republican josh hawley
is introduced to bill to strip disney of
some of his copyrights
now i i vehemently disagree with that
it's a political retaliation and it
changes a deal
and
i i have a real real
like i don't know it's
almost irrational
emotional response to anybody changing a
deal
i don't like changed deals i'll give you
the philosophical reason
the philosophical reason
is that the economy works best
when it's predictable
people will invest because they can
predict at least they think they can a
little bit what would happen if they
invest if you take away all the ability
to predict because anything could happen
then people don't invest
the economy suffers
right
so
the first thing is don't change a deal
and and somebody said to me scott
the government changes deals all the
time they change your tax rates they
change the laws
the government is changing deals all the
time why why do you pick this one like
why is this the one thing you're going
to pick on
to which i say okay you're wrong again
i pick on it every time something has
changed
it's a very basic economic rule
that you don't change stuff
people the economy will adapt even to
inefficiencies
but once it's adapted you don't want to
mess with it
right you don't you don't want to make
it have to re-adapt unless you have to
now there are reasons why you would
change things intentionally
but if you're just changing something
for political payback
that is not the reason to change
something so let me say as
full
full-throatedly as i can and this is not
a defense of disney by the way this is
not a defense of disney this is the this
is a defense of
systems that work
a system that works is that you don't
randomly not randomly but you don't
target a company
if you're the government
for special rule changes to punish them
you just don't do that and basically
this is up this is just up
and josh hawley i think is just a
 idiot really
i mean this is such a bad idea
now it might be politically good
it might be good for his team you know
it's popular
but what it looks like is somebody
trying to be ron desantis and failing
that's what it looks like it looks like
ron desantis is the genuine item like he
he knows how to get effect you know surf
the headlines and take advantage of the
news and do little things that really
get him attention in just the right way
so ron desantis is you know he's batting
a thousand basically he's just hitting
every note
and consistently i think josh hawley is
trying to be like that
and this is just not the right way to do
it
this just looks cheap it looks like a
cheap shot to me
all right here is the most interesting
tweet thread that i have seen in a long
time now i wouldn't normally read the
whole thread but it's so good
and it might explain so many things that
we're seeing
that i'm going to read it now i want to
warn you in advance there's one example
that's used within the thread
about the trans community
i disavow that comment
because i i think it's more complicated
situation
but but a comment does fit within his
thesis so well
then i'm going to read it anyway
normally i would consider it
not really the content i would share
with you
but because the larger opinion is so
solid
that i'm gonna i'm gonna take a little
uh uncomfortable discomfort with that
part of it okay
uh here's what uh a username p-e-g just
three letters p-e-g
um
and he says this he says he starts his
threat he says what leftists described
as empathy or compassion is really
narcissism now this is his theme
that the left is not really full of
empathy or compassion they're really
just narcissists he says the feeling of
being a good person and having power
over the punitive
victims they so solicitously help
then he goes on the tell is that there
is no reconsideration when their empathy
causes harm to the people it's directed
to
holy
holy
[Laughter]
this is the part where i said
i think he's onto something here all
right
let me that gives examples
he says if they actually cared he's
talking about leftists if they actually
cared and were just misguided they would
go oh turns out defunding the
police leads to lots and lots more black
people being shot
or pick another example or pick another
out of literally hundreds of examples
but they never
but they never ever do
in other words they never reconsider
that they're hurting their victims
they just double down that is what they
wanted
who does that
narcissist
that's who doesn't and i thought huh
he's on to something
the other tell he says is a total lack
of interest in other perspectives
well i think you could blame both sides
for that
right
but it does seem
it seems that the left have more
let's say less interest in listening to
the right than the right has an interest
in listening to the left
but that could be subjective
i mean maybe it is just that the right
is always subjected to the left's
opinion and it's easy to understand
so
uh then he goes on in this thread
he said imagine this
i meant well but i guess most hispanics
don't want to be called latinx
and since i believe in centering
uh you know
bipoc voices he goes nope never not once
so he's giving an example somebody who
would change their mind because
their their prescription for other
people didn't work in other words the
people they were trying to help
by being more respectful and calling the
latinx didn't want it
so they never say oh sorry
i guess you didn't want that so we'll
just stop doing it nope just keep doing
it
because it doesn't matter if they wanted
or not
who does that
um
and then he goes on again it's not just
that they disagree
which would be legitimate and human
it's that it doesn't even register for
them
because for them it's all about me me me
and the theater inside their own head
when they're a white knight where they
are waiting
in many ways they're the okay here's
here's the part where i'm uncomfortable
with this and i'm i'm just going to read
it because it's
it completes the picture
but this is not this does not match my
own opinion of the trans community all
right
he says
in many ways they're the prototype of
the abusive parent which is why the acme
of lib brain is munchausen by proxy
where where you castrate your own child
for their own good you see
okay here's the part where he's going
too far from my comfort but then he says
the deranged munch house by proxy trans
mom
is just the micro version of how they
see all problems munchausen by proxy
government
the point here is not the uh vaguely
police related word
oh i'm sorry
oh and he then gives an example of aoc
where she talks about herself
and you you sort of don't notice it
until he mentions it but here's an aoc
tweet to use as an example so the
beginning of her tweets started out this
way
tired of having to collectively stress
out about what explosion of hate crimes
blah blah
so he points out the aoc begins her
tweet by talking about how tired she is
that the problem is about her being
tired
and i've never noticed this before
and then he when he talks about aoc's
tweet he says that the point here is not
the vaguely policy related word salad
is that aoc is so tired and stressed
it's the first thing she mentions it's
what she cares about it's what she wants
you to know about her
and he says guess what tucker carlson
never talks about it on his show
himself
did you ever think about that
does tucker carlson ever talk about
himself
i don't know maybe he does but i can't
think of an example
um and then
and then the last part of the thread was
a tweet by george takai
um and this is george takai talking
about himself another leftist he goes
there's much talk these days of what
being a man entails i'm more of a man
than someone like tucker carlson would
ever be you know blah blah talks about
it himself and again it's another good
example of a prominent left-leaning
person
who starts by talking about
him or herself
now what do you think of this hypothesis
that leftist politics at least the
aggressive leftists not we're not
talking about people who just lead the
democrat right
can i can i make sure that you all know
when you talk about generalities you're
not talking about everybody you're not
talking about any of the people in the
middle ever you talk about the you know
the
the left and the right extremes usually
but this is a fairly solid point
that it does look like
narcissism now i would argue that
um
the all politics is just people talking
about themselves
can will you go that far with me
so i think that uh user peg peg makes a
great point that it looks like
narcissism drives the leftist
at least the most headline grabbing
stuff
but i'm not so sure that there isn't
just as much of a
personal projection going on on the
right
it just it just expresses itself
differently
because i think the right mostly wants
what's good for them individually
which they then assume would be good for
other people individually
for example
gun ownership
if you're on the right
and you're a certain type of person
where you're going to take a you're
going to take a gun ownership class
you're going to learn you know all the
safety elements of a gun you're going to
put a gun lock on it maybe put it in a
safe you're only going to use it in
emergency for self-defense
well in that case
guns are pretty good more good than bad
but lots of people are not in that
situation
and so generalizing your personal
preference for security
and imagining that you know other people
share it as opposed to being in more
danger because there are more guns in
their
apartment or house or
environment
so
lots of times i think that all of us are
just
generalizing from ourselves and i would
argue that everything is that
i would argue that everything we invent
is a is a person
it's an extreme thought let me connect
that
everything we invent is an extension of
our selves
for example the internet
is us talking but we're doing it better
an airplane is us walking but faster
right
this is just a conversation
but extended
so everything that we invent is just us
it's just more of it
and i have it i have a theory
that is all we can invent
that you could never invent anything
that isn't a projection of yourself
because you couldn't even think of it
now that might be too far
i don't have any way to prove that but
it feels as if we don't even have the
ability
to see anything that isn't a version of
ourselves
we fall in love with something that
feels like something about us
you you have a pet that feels like
something about you everything's about
you
all right um i asked this question and i
don't
i guess i was just being provocative but
also curious
it's the middle of may
and those of you who have watched me for
a long time you know how i get stuffed
up in allergy season and it's actually
hard to listen to the sometimes it's
hard to listen to the
live stream
because i'll be so stuffed up
this is the middle of may i don't have
any allergies
at all
this is literally peak season this this
week would be the peak of the whole year
nothing
why
now the i'm trying to think what's
different
now it could be yeah somebody said
vitamin d but there doesn't seem to be a
strong enough mechanism for that
some people said maybe it's your
vaccination
but the i asked on the internet and
people had experiences all over the
place there were people who never had
vaccine who never had bad allergies who
have the worst time they've ever had
this year
so there are some people
oh that's interesting wildfires
i i think it's actually early for the
wildfire season though so that's not a
may thing that's usually a summer thing
it's not the drought
because
the current conditions where i am are
completely green and lush
so it's not the drought
it will be it would be the drought over
the summer
but in the spring there's still plenty
of water everything's green
so the plants are not feeling any
drought the plants are well fed so that
shouldn't be it
um you jinx yourself your cat your cat
no i had the cat until just this week
and i didn't have any allergies
now the other thing that i did is i
stopped
stopped
having things with sulfites in them
because it turns out i do have a severe
allergy to a food additive that took me
my entire life to discover
it's their various sulfite related
chemicals that i have a reaction to now
they're usually in wine so i do have a
allergy to alcohol
and they're in salad dressings and
dressings and i have i do have a
reaction to those
but it's also hidden in a lot of
different foods and you don't notice it
on the label so it's really hard to
avoid
but this is the first time that i've
tried hard
to avoid that and sure enough i'm having
a good spring so is it possible i never
had allergies but that doesn't make
sense
and that i don't really have an answer
for it so it could be that california is
low pollen it could be just a
coincidence could be 100 things i don't
think it's from the vaccinations
so can i say that clearly
i don't see evidence that the
vaccinations had any correlation with
anything because when i asked online
people were all over the place
right they were every combination of i
did or did not get faxed i did or did
not have worse lately but there's
something going on
there's a whole bunch of people who said
their allergy situation is completely
different than any year in their life
what is that is it just confirmation
bias it could be
yeah it could be
all right so i watched 2 000 mules last
night as many of you requested
and i was not surprised that it was
deeply persuasive
it was deeply persuasive
now i knew that before i watched it and
i told you that right
because
documentaries are the most persuasive
form of communication
because you get let's say an hour of one
point of view with no
no counterpoint
imagine any lawyer who could make who
could argue in court for an hour
and the other attorney couldn't talk
there would be no evidence presented on
the other side how persuasive would one
lawyer
talking for an hour
and no counterpoint how persuasive would
that be
100 percent how persuasive is a
documentary that talks for an hour and
shows no counterpoint
100
so remember being persuasive has nothing
to do with being true
do you all get that that's really
important
this documentary is persuasive as hell
i mean it's really persuasive
doesn't mean it's true
doesn't mean it's true
um
so
that's the first thing
so i wrote a little thread on my take on
it and i saw that dinesh had retweeted
it and said he wishes that
other people took the same critical
opinion of it now it's notable
because i was not entirely positive
about the movie
this is notable i was not entirely
positive about the movie and dinesh
still said
this is the kind of thinking i want
everybody to do about the movie
so his credibility i think improved
like by that statement because he
allowed a negative about the movie into
into the opinion that he tweeted
retweeted
all right so
i'll read what i said in my tweet i said
i watched 2000 mules last night it makes
a persuasive case for major election
fraud in
don't take me off the platform yet
because i'm gonna soften that a little
bit okay so before i'm removed from all
from all uh social media
wait for the rest
uh so i watched it last night it was
very persuasive and then i say most
documentaries are persuasive so are most
lawyers that's why i never trust either
one i recommend you do the same so keep
in mind that i just said most
documentaries are persuasive so are most
lawyers that's why i never trust them
and you should do the same so in my
tweet thread i told you you should not
trust
this documentary to be true
and the person who made the documentary
retweeted that
because he also says
and i think this is a fair
characterization of his opinion i think
he also says
you should not take it as the final
answer
it's it's enough information for you to
go to the next step which i believe is
what he would like you to do now if you
took the next step and found out that
the early indications that are pretty
strong signals
were false signals
then wouldn't that be good to know
i would really like to know that if none
of this is
indicative of a real problem i'd like to
know
that's very important
all right
but then i said
uh i said i said the alleged debunk of
the film so i've seen in writing
in some
smaller outlets because the bigger
outlets aren't even talking about right
but but some smaller entities
attempted to debunk the film
but their debunk is nothing but hand
waving
let me pause and tell you what it was
the debunk i saw
was that the method used in the the
documentary 2000 mules was that they
they got a hold of uh
the analysts got a hold of his cell
phone tracking geolocation stuff and
that they could find that there were
certain per people who went between
certain organizations non-profits and
drop boxes
way more times than anybody would have a
normal reason to go in those directions
so they could find that there was an
unusually high level of activity
of people the same person going over and
over to a drop box in lots of places in
lots of places that the election was had
an unusual outcome
and there's lots of videos
of people putting multiple ballots in
boxes
now we don't know if those people were
maybe legal maybe they had gigantic
families
and they were taking all the ballots for
their family
that is possible
which would be
legal or
it's exactly what it looks like a bunch
of mules in other words transporters
just taking these ballots from however
they got them and
shoving them in boxes which would be
very illegal
so um
the pushback is that the uh
the cell phone data would not be
accurate enough to know that they
actually put the ballots in the box
okay
that's it
that's the debug
the debunk is that the
uh the phone information is not accurate
enough
to know that they actually put a ballot
in a box just that they were in the
neighborhood
now if you listen to the movie
whether or not the movie is telling you
everything true i don't know that part
but the way they describe it
their method would be
pretty darn persuasive
now i don't know if it's wrong
don't know if it's wrong
i don't know if they analyzed it wrong
but
it's very persuasive
all right so and and so i said this
um
a reasonable assumption under these
circumstances the circumstances being
that the pushback
is weak
and and the film is massively censored
by the alleged guilty team
right if the team that is being um
in this case the democrats if their team
is being blamed of something and they're
also the ones primarily behind censoring
that allegation
well that's a little suspicious too
and the fact that the pushback is so
weak it's just ridiculous
now that doesn't mean that there isn't a
good argument against the movie
i just haven't seen it
nobody's offered it in any public way
that i've seen
and
and then just to keep myself on social
media i said to be clear no core has
ruled that the 2020 election had
substantial fraud but lacking full
i capitalize full election transparency
a responsible citizen can assume fraud
because the signals are all there
so in my opinion if you if you made an
assumption that 2020 was fraudulent
without without core evidence
because it's not proven definitely not
proven
but the the situation is sub is
sufficiently
signal rich
that that would be a reasonable
assumption
that it was a rigged election
doesn't mean it's proven doesn't mean i
have evidence of it but the signals
i would say are so strong
that you could be quite a reasonable
citizen you might be wrong
but you would be reasonable into some in
assuming it was fraudulent
that would be very reasonable
sorry
yeah if somebody doesn't like that
um there's nothing i can do about it
yes and as as the comments here i think
i feel like i was the first one to see
this by so to say this but i saw a
sebastian gorka say
in the film
and it was in the comments here that if
you thought that hitler was actually
running for president
you would do whatever you could to rig
the election would you so to imagine
that the democrats who actually thought
trump trump was a form of hitler to
imagine that they wouldn't try to stop
him is sort of an insult to them isn't
it
it's a pretty big insult to democrats if
they didn't try to rig the election
in fact i'd hate them
i mean i think i think i would have no
respect for them all if they didn't try
to rig the election from their
assumption
that trump was like the devil
like now that part i disagree with
but if that's their starting point
i can't respect them if they didn't try
to kill him
i
i guess that was too provocative
we don't want us we don't want to
recommend any kind of violence so we're
not doing that i'm just saying that
they're not acting consistent if they
really believe that stuff
they should act a lot more aggressively
and they should tell you right up front
yeah we totally rigged that election
because there's no way we're going to
let this hitler in there
might as well just admit it
now i think that that suggests they
don't believe their own arguments
there's something to that
all right
so that's my bottom line on the movie
very persuasive but that doesn't mean
anything about being true
and ladies and gentlemen this is my
concludes my shorter better
uh amazing live stream
yeah that now bidens after the ultra
megas
ultra
i'm not just mega
i'm ultra
ultra
all right
inflation numbers came out i imagine
they're bad
how do what do we believe if we can't
believe the news and we can't believe
our own research
don't believe anything
so we have we have to navigate a world
in which nothing is um credible
there are ways to do it i mean there are
a number of strategies for making your
cost-benefit decisions
but you have to do it with the
assumption that you can't trust anything
all right
uh
it's got electrolytes
all right
that's all for now
uh disney has a special except all right
let's talk about the disney copyright
thing a little more detail
that my
my problem with changing the situation
with disney has nothing to do with
whether the deal they had was fair or
good
that's not the point
that should be
irrelevant what should be relevant is
that you make a deal and you do
one of the reasons you make deals
is to create predictability
economies need predictability
even if things are inefficient people
will adapt to it you don't want to
change things midstream that's just a
bad economic
thing always
imagine if you had invested in real
estate for years and you know you're
going to retire and you've done well
and then the government says uh we're
going to take away all of your tax
benefits
for your life's work
they could do that
and it wouldn't even be unfair because
you made all your money with an unfair
tax benefit
you worked all your life use you used
those set of rules that you believed
would be stable
and then at the end they said you know i
think you actually owe us all those
taxes that we told you you didn't have
to pay because we can we're the
government and it wasn't really fair
that you got all those breaks in the
past so we're going to make you pay it
back
because other people didn't get those
breaks would you be okay with that
see the
there's a larger economic
um
let's say
i don't know i wouldn't call it a
guideline but sort of a
a thing that you can't ignore
which is when you make things
unpredictable it ruins the economy
now this is just one small special case
so if you say to yourself scott this is
such a special case this isn't going to
ruin any economy this is just bad for
disney
and you don't like them to which i say
you don't want to make this a precedent
you know anytime you can not change a
rule that's the way to go right anytime
you have the option of not changing
things do it now an exception would be
if you've got a bunch of health and
safety things that don't work
of course you want to change those
but if something's sort of
cruising along and i would say that the
disney copyright problem wasn't causing
any problem for anybody was it
like nobody was worse off because mickey
mouse
is a protected copyright nobody no
nobody was worse off it didn't hurt
anybody
and it probably allowed disney to grow
into the robust business that
probably contributes to florida in a lot
of ways
so
changing deals i just have uh uh
i have i admit it's partly emotional
when you change a deal i just get really
angry
just don't like it at all but some of
that's on me right so i'm projecting
from my
personal preferences
um
a micro lesson on finding the truth
uh i don't know if i can make that micro
but it is a big subject of my book loser
think it's sort of the main theme so it
would be hard to
summarize that entire body but i might
be able to do that
i'll try that
mickey was around before
yeah before disney world but
it's a big part of it
all right that's all for now i'll go
i'll talk to you tomorrow
i'm not sure about the time difference
but we'll see how that works bye
