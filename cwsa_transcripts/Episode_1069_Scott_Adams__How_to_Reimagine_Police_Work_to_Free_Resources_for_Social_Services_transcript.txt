hey everybody this is a special
unexpected
uh live stream i want to talk about one
topic
and one topic only today it's the topic
about
defunding the police which of course is
a provocative thought
some people want fewer police presence
or less of it some people want more of
it
so the country is being torn apart and i
would like to suggest
that this is not a question of left or
right even though we've made it that way
the question of defunding the police
should be a
technology and systems question
in other words we should be thinking of
it in terms of a puzzle to solve and not
a left problem or a right problem
and the puzzle is this how do you get
more bang for your buck
a very basic corporate business decision
how do you take this thing we've been
doing policing
how do you get as much benefit as you
can at the lowest
cost and i would say that just thinking
of it that way
would make a big difference and so i
would like to say
we should think of it more as
reimagining the police
not defunding them defunding is sort of
a
those are fighting words and we don't
need that
but i would suggest that we already have
in place
everything we need or very close to it
to be able to do something that really
radically
reimagines the police so what i'm going
to tell you
are some things that already exist so if
you say to me
scott scott scott we will never be able
to develop these things
you're already behind the times
everything i talk about
already exists we just have to think
about it in this way
and it's going to be able to to move us
forward it looks like this
so you have a current police force with
a current budget and a current way of
doing things
but at the same time there's a little
satellite
around them of private companies who are
doing
functions they have in some cases wide
application
but they're also really really good for
police
and i'll talk about a few of these in a
moment
if you'd use this model where you let
private companies
develop new technologies that would make
policing
way more effective cost effective so it
gets the job done
at a much lower cost would you like to
see these kinds of things experimented
with
inside the police force in other words
inside a government-like entity or would
you like to see private entity
doing the development and taking the
risk it's a rhetorical question
the last thing you want is a government
entity or something like the police
force doing
technology innovation right you don't
want it there
you want it where it is in the private
industry now there are a few
developments that really make the idea
of changing or reimagining how police
work is done
very practical so when the left says hey
let's defund the police
and make money available for social
services i say
that is completely doable it is
completely doable
without losing a thing in policing and
because of this new technology that i'll
talk about in a moment
you can actually get far better police
results
and i'm talking about multiples of
better i'm not talking about a
10 improvement i'm talking about a five
times improvement sort of situation here
are some examples
let's take dna if you are a serial
rapist it is possible that the police
already have
several records of you with your dna
because you might be leaving it at each
of these sex
crimes places but it would be very
common
for the police to have three separate
dna samples for three separate crimes
and not know who you are because knowing
your dna
doesn't automatically make you findable
approximately 15 percent of sex crimes
you can take the dna and actually find
the person
85 percent of the time it's just a data
and a record and
it's a dead end can't find the person
but
the newer dna technologies and we won't
get into
specific companies i'm going to talk
generically now the newer dna
they could take the dna from the suspect
and they could find their family members
and if you find somebody's family
members because there are enough people
who have dna in different places
etc that are accessible if you can find
their family members
you can pretty much find the suspect
almost every time
because you just go to uncle bob and you
say hey bob
do you know anybody in your family who
might live
in this neighborhood and uncle bob will
say yeah
that's that's my nephew jason and then
you go check on jason
and you've got your suspect so
imagine the uh that level of improvement
to go from about 15 percent of your
cases
are solved if i i'm talking about
violent rapes
15 1-5 is how many they can identify
an external company can get them all
can get them all now nothing's 100 right
so when i
say can get them all you should
translate that into your head to
you know maybe 90 or something but to go
from
1 5 to 90 percent
how expensive would that be and here's
the kicker
not very it's not very expensive in fact
there are hundreds of thousands of rape
kits
in other words the the sample that's
been taken from the crime
that have not been tested hundreds of
thousands of them
now most of them will be tested and
they'll go through the system
but they will not result in any kind of
a match
they could go to an external company
and say for this reasonable dollar
amount
can you solve all of our worst cases so
you could take for example
all of the records that have multiple
crimes associated with the same dna
and you can say to this company look
we've got
five dna samples from five different
rapes
and we don't know who this is how many
drugs do you
how many crimes do you prevent
if you take a serial rapist off the
streets
maybe a lot you could end up solving or
not solving but preventing 10 rapes
by getting you one serial rapist and
likewise i suppose if it's some other
kind of violent crime that leaves dna
so imagine how much is being left you
know sort of on the table
of free money because this isn't
completely being used at the moment
and that's just one example imagine
having facial recognition
widely available for the police imagine
the police have a suspect
get a photo somehow and they can
identify them
now you have the problem with
african-american faces
or harder to identify but apparently
that is not
common to all of the different facial
technologies
there are some that are actually good at
distinguishing african-american faces
and some are not so if you hear some
stories about
facial recognition has problems with
black citizens
that's true but it's not true of all the
technologies
or at least not as true and and
certainly
uh there's something about the process
that can be done better
right and we i talked about this on a
separate periscope
that if you have a match you think you
have a match and you go to the
suspect's house to find out if your
facial recognition got the right person
you should at least bring the picture
with you so you can hold it up and when
the person answers the door you can say
uh okay we didn't get a match this time
it's obvious i'm looking at you i'm
looking at the picture
it's not you sorry to bother you so
there's
something that could be done differently
in the system to make the technology
even more bulletproof
likewise police are already using drones
you can imagine
uh private drone companies being able to
take the risk away from the police
and to just try some stuff and it works
or it doesn't work and then the police
can watch it they can decide to do more
of it or less
imagine if you will i'm just
brainstorming here imagine if you will
if private drone companies
made a bunch of deals to put drones on
rooftops
just staged in various places around the
city
i'm just making this up this doesn't
exist and imagine if there was a crime
and the police force had a deal with the
drone company and they said look
we've got a crime in this neighborhood
can you get us some eyes on it
drone takes off and takes pictures
and they get the best look at look at
things that they can
if the drone has a good camera
then you got your facial recognition all
right so
some of these are being done in some
fashion but what you'll find
is uh you're gonna say to yourself well
scott you've just described a perfectly
good system
so is this already working is it isn't
this already working because why
wouldn't it be
the police know about these technologies
in most cases
they know about them why aren't they
using them
some are some are not but why isn't it
just like widespread
just this is the way you do it and the
reason is bureaucracy
the reason is the left and the right the
battle over
you know turf the nobody wants to be to
lose their job on the old system that's
not working
how do you how do you get anything done
in a bureaucracy it's all that stuff
but as as these technologies prove
themselves
with the police entities that do use
them and they're all being tested
somewhere
as they're being tested it will be
impossible
to ignore them because if you have one
city that is solving all of its sex
crimes
just think about that suppose you had
one city that said
we don't have any backlog we solved them
all just give us the dna
we'll solve it for you too how does how
does chicago
just to use an example how do they not
do this
if some other city let's say baltimore
tries it out and it just works
and they not do something that's so
obviously good and works and saves money
now the idea is that each of these
technologies
is so much more effective than what the
police are doing already
that it should take the amount of
resources they need way down would the
police be in favor of this
let's say the individual police officer
not talking about
bureaucracy not talking about left or
right or
the mayor or anybody else would the
individual police officer
be happier if these technologies were
more widely deployed
i think yes they'd be happier on a
number of levels
number one if you're a police officer
don't you like to solve
crimes of course you do what what
is better if you're a police officer
than actually doing good work and
solving crimes and
making your community a better place you
probably get a raise
so that's all good but i would argue
that also there's a secondary benefit
which is really big
it's really big which is if you're a
police officer all of these
entities which you would then be working
closely with
become a career path because wouldn't it
be good
to have a you know experienced police
officer working on your drone
startup you know working on any of your
other startups that have
policing technology involved
so this is the basic idea uh you'll
notice there's some themes i'm pulling
together one is that
uh a b testing is always the way to go
if you can if something can be tested
and to do it large you know and to roll
it out everywhere would be really
expensive
well then test is small this is the
perfect
situation for testing as small now the
other thing that's working here the
other big theme
is changing the system of course it's a
it's a change in the system
instead of moving all of the functions
of police
within the police organization and
budget
you can move some of it out to private
corporations
and de-risk it in other words the
private corporation can take all of the
risks
that a police entity could not and i'm
not talking about life and death risks
you know nobody should be taking those
i'm talking about just something that
might be embarrassing if it didn't work
something that
if if a police put their budget into it
and then it failed
well that'd be bad for the police bad
for everybody
so you take that risk and you just move
it into places where people like risks
venture capitalists entrepreneurs they
like risk
so move it where they like it and it
won't hurt the rest of the the people
until it's
proven um
i'm looking at the comments it says
scott does not talk about the real
problem
which is the wickedness and the hearts
of people
well that might be a different periscope
somebody else is going to have to do
that
but i do make the following claim that
there are a lot of things that look like
there are problems of the left
and problems of the right and not not
agreeing
this is not one of them this is a
problem that has artificially been put
into the world of politics
because everything is but it has nothing
to do with politics
there's nobody in the world who wouldn't
like better police
police effectiveness with less violence
and a lower cost there isn't anybody who
doesn't want that
and so if you take it out of the
political realm and put it in the
economic realm
the entrepreneur realm the you know the
realm where ideas
actually work and can be tested well
then you've got a solution that works
for everybody
and of course language gets us in
trouble because it
is what i just described a case of
defunding the police
kind of yeah because the ultimate result
would be the police would be far
more effective and there's also another
impact on top of this
imagine you're a criminal some of you
might be criminals so it's easy to
imagine
imagine you're a criminal and in today's
world
if you did a violent rape you could get
identified
0.15 not 0.15 15 of the time
that's not much of a disincentive is it
because a lot of people who are you know
inclined to crime if they see there's
only a
15 chance of even by being identified
you might be you might be willing to do
the crime suppose you had a 90
chance of getting caught would you do
the crime
some people will and they'll be caught
they'll be caught but they won't do a
second crime
because they got caught after the first
so that's my idea i thought i'd put that
out there for a comment and
i'd love to see your feedback so give me
your comments
and we'll go from there
