well here we are getting ready for the
show as we're waiting for everybody to
pour in I'm printed my
notes any moment
now you have the best show you've ever
seen there we
go yes ladies and Gent gentlemen there
will
be double
whiteboards well good morning and
welcome to coffee with Scott Adams the
highlight of human civilization if you'd
like to take your experience today up to
levels that nobody can even understand
for their tiny smooth human brains all
you need is a copper muger a glass of
tanker chalice or Stein a canting Jugger
flask of vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite look at I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine day
of the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens
now
delicious well if you follow the dilber
reborn comic that you can only see if
you subscribe on X or if you're members
of local plus you get a lot more on
locals you would know that ratbird who
works for the Washington Post as a
writer has been assigned a CIA person
who will be telling him what to write so
look for
that well in the big news let's start
I'm going to start with the big news and
then we'll work the little news later in
the big news uh Denmark is going to
Institute a cow fart tax because of the
methane emissions so the farting cows
are warming the Earth we're all going to
die and so Denmark has decided to uh
increase your taxes if you've got a cow
that farts now as I've told you they're
that's not the first thing they tried
the first thing they tried was
corks they thought you know if we just
put a cork in these cattle's ass but
what happens was the the gas that
couldn't be expelled from the
cow started building up and eventually
the cows would turn into
durables you know if they inflated
enough they would be lighter than air
and a lot of the cows inflated and uh
ended up sort of drifting over to
France and uh so they said well that's
no good we're not going to Cork their
asses anymore we'll just tax them we'll
just tax them so if you ever think to
yourself can I reduce my taxes by by
putting a cork in my own ass no no don't
do it because you might find yourself in
France and nobody wants
that um the good news uh scientists have
found a way to make mice live
forever so uh they found a molecule that
will uh influence their telr you know
the part that makes you old and uh it'll
increase their memory and speed and
coordination in their grips
you know if there's one thing that's
been bothering me for a while is that
mice they have the older ones their grip
strength it's it's nothing to write home
about let me tell you like if you put
your finger out for a mice or a mouse we
call a single a single one a
mouse and it grabbed you and it tried to
hold on with just his little uh hand
strength you'd be like are you serious
mouse that that that's your total hand
strength uh not very impressive not very
impressive at all but scientists have
figured out how to make those mice
stronger
smarter reduced
inflammation and it's going to be great
for mice everywhere there's some thought
that something like this could someday
be useful for
people but that's down the road the
immediate benefit is to the mice and
we're going to have the oldest
healthiest mice you've ever seen
so if you've got a mouse in your house
uh it might be a fair fight in in a few
months there's a report in the New York
Post and this is the kind of news that
we need and the science that we need you
know there's a lot of frivolous news and
science you can't trust sometimes but
every now and then the media will get it
right and the science will be right
here's an
example New York Post is reporting
that a quarter of the respondents
surveyed in a new study said they've
orgasmed from being
tickled just being
tickled wow that that's quite a headline
and I'm glad I read the whole story
because a quarter of the respondence
surveyed a quarter of them now
immediately I say to myself huh huh the
Scott Alexander
rule that says that if something is
sounds fantastically unlike
even though it's in the
news you're going to soon find out it's
not true because I'm pretty sure you've
met other human beings you may have met
more than four people I'll bet you would
know if a quarter of the people you know
would have an orgasm from being tickled
don't you think you'd know that you'd
probably know there there would be some
story in your life is like well I was
just tickling somebody and you wouldn't
believe what happened tried it again
worked t tce so if you read down the
article it turns out that what they mean
by a quarter of the
respondents is a quarter of the
respondents who had said in
advance that they have a fetish for
being
tickled so of the universe of people who
have already responded to a survey
saying oh my God I like being tickled it
gives me a sexual thrill a quarter of
those people actually had an
orgasm now that's not so impressive is
it I'd like to do a survey of people who
like milk all right you're all the
people who said you like milk all right
here's the question do you like
milk wow almost every
person wow that's called a science it's
not just science it's science you can
use you can immediately apply this in
your own
life well I read that and just to make
sure I tickled myself
and uh sure enough major
orgasm
so um as speaking of
breakthroughs uh you know that solar
panels are usually made from the same
old silicon stuff but there's this thing
that could work better called uh per pav
skite so uh over at Rice
University which is weird did you know
there's a a university just for
rice I don't know but uh Rice University
uh where the students are just I assume
just various versions of
rice um but it's smart rice because the
rice came up with this idea of how to
modify or make a I don't know I think
it's a a fake version of this pav
skite now uh the parkite is not only
useful for making potentially much more
efficient and reliable solar power uh
solar cells but but perovsky is also the
name of the uh newest General uh for
Russia and
Ukraine oh I have an update he's been
replaced he's been replaced
okay as you know uh Assange made a deal
and a lot of us said hm huh I feel like
the story about Assange making this plea
deal is maybe missing
something I know it's the fog of War
it's the first day but it really feels
like there's some big variable that
might be
missing and we found out what that big
variable is kim.com tells us and others
do too that apparently Wikileaks
Wikileaks agreed to delete the DNC
files so they had to delete the stuff
that was
real and that was apparently part of the
plea
deal but here's the good news kim.com is
hopefully reminding us that they're all
still available at The Pirate Bay um I
don't know how legal it is to access the
Pirate
Bay but since it's been taken down from
the the wikileak site just know that if
you ever really really needed it you
could get
it kim.com doing us a
solid how many of you have seen the now
viral video of Tucker Carlson in
Australia
uh uh going off on a reporter who has
some a series of dumb questions in
public well I'm not going to try to
characterize it because it would ruin
your enjoyment of watching it I'm just
gonna say if you don't like the fake
news you're really GNA like that video
so you'll see it in my f my feed or you
could just just Google or or search on X
for Tucker Carlson and the
Australian Australian reporter and
you're going to have fun because he
starts out tough and it just gets
tougher and he just he just destroys her
in public just absolutely dismantles her
and she she just starts acting stupider
and stupider and he just keeps laughing
at her and destroying her and it's just
great I recommend
it so did I say that Tucker's in
Australia Australia
where did Assange
go back to
Australia who is the kind of person
you'd expect to be the first to
interview
Assange I would expect tuer to be the
first
maybe well as you know there's a debate
tonight um and uh CNN has uh rolled down
some technology some anti-trump
technology
uh they've got some voice suppression
and microphone cancellation going
on they're probably working hard to make
the lighting worse for Trump than for
Biden it's funny that we don't trust
anything about this the debate we don't
trust anything about it uh uh but that's
what makes it fun uh so I will be
watching it live I'm going to live
stream a lot of people will be live
streaming I'm sure a lot of podcast PS
but I'll be live streaming too and I
will do
it
um probably just for locals I think I'll
just do it for locals because the other
the other outlets will be doing their
thing but uh maybe well let me think see
the problem is if I live stream it on
YouTube YouTube might give me a strike
for copyright
infringement so I might have to I might
we'll see I might stream it on X and
Rumble and locals and forget YouTube
this time I think that's probably what
I'll
do all right um uh axios apparently when
they reported about the 16 economists
who say that uh Trump will destroy the
economy 16 economists they got to sign a
letter wow they couldn't get
51 they could only get 16 they should
take some advice from the intelligence
community that can get 51 people to sign
any damn thing but uh here's something
that people are saying the aios left out
of the
reporting uh this is Fox News busting
them apparently these are all donors to
the Biden
campaign they're all people who are just
known
hardcore uh Democrat
donors don't you think that would be a
little a little bit important to mention
now it is it is the case that if they
legitimately came to the opinion that
Trump was the Menace to the
economy then it would make sense they
would also be Biden
supporters but I don't think that's
what's happening and I think the axios
would have owed us a little bit extra
clarification of who they were were they
a randomly picked group of people who
are all over the political Spectrum or
are they hardcore Democrats who are just
going to say what Democrats say because
it's not much of a story if the story is
16 Democrats agree with
Democrats
because that's really all it was no you
don't have to tell
me that Rice University is well
known there there may be some people
here who are having trouble with
satire so seek help
all right ABC has a new fake news
technique that I thought was so clever
I'm going to call it the triple click
fake news triple click now you know the
the scrolling trick right where the news
will say something completely fake or
misleading in the first paragraph of a
long article because they know you're
not going to scroll to the end or a lot
of people won't and in the end they'll
say and it should be mentioned that
everything we said in the first
paragraph is completely opposite and
wrong and misleading now they don't say
it in those words but the words they do
use are basically just that yeah
everything in the first paragraph is a
lie and now that we're adding the
context you can see that it's really the
reverse of what we said very common but
now there's a new one the triple click
fake news so it goes like this Trump
claimed a
retribution so this is this is the top
level article on ABC so it's ABC own own
site it claims that Trump wanted
retribution and it mentions that people
like Liz Cheney are concerned that they
would be the targets of
Retribution so if you were going to read
that by itself what would you think that
Trump had said he was going to do did
wouldn't you think that Trump maybe have
mentioned some people like Liz Cheney
because she's
worried well or maybe he said something
that was close enough that it would make
sense she'd be worried and so the
article linked to the backup story that
backs up their claim that Trump had
claimed he wanted some
retribution so I clicked on the story to
see what what exactly did he say that
would make Liz jany
afraid and then that
story simply refers to yet another page
also on ABC News That's the Bas story so
now I've gone down three different
stories to the third story um I've gone
to the third story to find out what
exactly did he say about retribution and
when you get to the third one it's not
about Trump wants retribution against
Liz Cheney or any
individuals he wants retribution against
the
government he's saying you know the
government was your enemy my retribution
will be going in there and cleaning
things up and making the country work
and by the third time that they'd hidden
that behind well if you click this link
you could find out more by the time they
get to the top level of the
hoax they're suggesting that he said
something that would make LZ Cheney
afraid it's a pretty good trick it's
almost as good as the uh the correction
you know you get 100 million clicks on
the fake story and you know a thousand
clicks on the correction
um the AP has said this that the uh
Trump's claim that the 2020 election was
rigged has been
disproven has
it I I feel like that would have been a
big
story if it had been
disproven it seems like that'd be a big
headline can can you find me that
story can anybody find me the story in
the news any news even the fake news
that says that there was some kind of
process that disproved the
claim of course not nothing like that
happened in the real world there is no
way to disapprove the claim you can only
you can only
show that the claim was not accepted by
a
court which is true there were no
individual claims that a court has
accepted or endorsed now in many cases
it's because they said they didn't have
a
standing um and a variety of things some
technical reasons there's a locked door
in uh
Georgia that if it were unlocked we
could find out if those ballots were
real or fake but they won't unlock it
even though the judge said they should
and now the lawyers for that locked door
are saying they'd like permission to
destroy the ballots that they can't show
you now I had speculated early on that
that so-called locked uh room by now if
there was anything illegal in there it
been
removed I think Tucker had mentioned
somebody said Tucker had mentioned it
was like a two-hour window when the
security cameras were down so I think
it's already removed and I think that
the reason the lawyers would ask for it
to be destroyed as opposed to just
opening the door and say why don't you
take a look you'll see they're all valid
and then you know once you're happy
we'll destroy them why would you do a
legal process to do something that would
be as easy as unlocking a door that the
judge told you to
unlock why why would you go through all
that trouble well the most likely reason
is that there's nothing in the room and
the lawyers are going to act like they
didn't know that and they're going to
say my clients asked this to get
permission to get rid of the stuff they
say is in the room so the lawyers will
be in the clear because they will never
have looked in the room they will be
taking the word of their client that
they need permission to destroy what
they say is in the room so the the
lawyers won't be breaking any laws
because they could just say we don't
know what's in the room we're just doing
the work of our
client and I'm pretty sure there's
nothing in the
room now does that mean that election
rigging has been
disproven it's a lot closer to the
opposite that every indication is that
it was rigged and that the cover up is
in full you know full swing but I can't
prove it but I'll tell you what I can't
prove also I can't prove it was not
rigged that's not even a thing and uh I
was in a news article being mocked
because some election official uh
schooled me on the fact that our
elections are fully auditable and
therefore we can now essentially prove
that the election was fair now I got
some questions for you
why is it that the security software and
systems for every highly
secure business and facility has to
continually update their software
because they found
vulnerabilities why would they do that
if it's so easy to secure a digital
system why is it that there's a major
company that's being uh blackmailed
right now by hackers who got control of
their very important critical
infrastructure structure is it because
they didn't know how to do cyber
security or could it be that if you're
good enough at hacking let's say a state
actor and you could get insiders and you
can get people to switch Sims in
different places and you can put them to
embed embed passwords in their code that
sort of thing do you think you could
catch
that I don't and here's another question
apparently Texas is talking about a law
to to you know put some kind of
numbering system on the ballots do you
know why because if you don't do it you
can't audit the system wait a minute
wait a minute they have to do a
significant change in Texas to make it
possible for the first time to audit a
critical part of the voting like a
really critical part why why would they
be talking about improving
something that's already fully
auditable why why are they even having a
convers ation is it because Texas likes
to do things that don't need to be done
that's is that part of the Texas
character hey we found some stuff that
doesn't need to be done let's put all
our energy into doing
it no you've been lied to
Forever that our elections could be
audited in a way that you would know
that they're fair I don't even think
they're doing signature verification in
many
cases that that's not just not
auditable that's clearly working in the
other direction we're we're as far from
a reliable credible system as you could
possibly get and even if the votes were
right which seems really unlikely in my
personal
opinion just based on everything we see
about everything it seems very
unlikely uh we do know that the
intelligence
people ran an OP to give 51 people to
lie to you about something that would
have changed more votes than the margin
of victory for Biden that stuff we know
for sure that's not a guess and the only
purpose for it was election
interference there are no questions
unanswered in that story we know every
part of the story it's all transparent
and it's
public so
anyway well the first amend died in the
Supreme Court um so the the Supreme
Court ruled that they uh they're not
going to stop the government from
interfering with social
media so the government can lean on
social media to get them to do what they
want and apparently that's still legal
so that would be the end of free
speech no I'm just kidding it's not the
end of free speech
yeah I you know sometimes I speak in
hyperbolic terms and I have to stop and
say oh not everybody understands
hyperbole it's not the end of free
speech people can I just be clear about
that it's not it's not literally
actually the end of free speech because
Free Speech ended a long time ago so you
can't end something that's already
gone let's go to the Whiteboard
here's our current
system see about right
there so there was a time when the
government was all about the rights and
and your rights were either taken away
or granted by the government you know
you could say God granted your rights or
nature did but in fact the government
had to agree with it or you didn't
really have it so that got
outsourced so the government's not in
the you know suppressing speech business
except indirectly so now what we have is
a situation in which the government but
really just the Democrats because the
Republicans don't participate in this
sort of stuff so the Democrats set the
narrative for example they might say you
know uh everybody has to love uh
transitioning children or everybody has
to of Dei or climate
change right that sort of thing so the
narrative is set and then because we're
a big free market not really free market
but you know sort of uh uh country the
big businesses they don't really have
the freedom to violate the narrative
because if they did they would be
complaints from their
stockholders the stockholders would say
um the government told you what is right
and correct and true why are you saying
the opposite I I can't even do business
with you and by the way if you disagree
with the government on the big stuff
when you need the government to do
something for you and all the big
companies eventually do gota gotta have
a rule or make a rule or suspend a rule
or you got to enforce something or not
enforce something you got to change some
kind of Regulation some kind of
code you're not going to get anything
unless
you're compatible with the narrative the
common narrative so big business because
they're they're uh responsible primarily
by Design they're responsible to their
stockholders and the stockholders will
never be well served if they try to tell
the truth if it violates the
narrative so you if you work for a big
business and you could substitute any
big organization it's not necessarily
just a profitable business could be any
any large organization and pretty much
every
individual is working for or needs to
work with or selling to or is a customer
of or has an association with large
organizations and you couldn't really
operate as a modern person in the modern
world without lots of associations for
or with organizations of one type or
another and they will cancel you
they will cancel you now you might say
to me wow you know when you say it that
way Scott it does sound pretty bad and
it sounds like all that happened to free
speech is that when the government was
not allowed to suppress it directly they
just used the free market to do it and
the Supreme Court just upheld the
government's ability to pressure because
it is pressure it's not just requesting
when the government requests something
it's not just a
request they have
guns right I mean they don't use them
unless they got to put you in jail and
you resist but they have guns they can
make you do what you want and you're
probably going to want to do it anyway
just stay out of trouble you know stay
under the under the
radar but one of the things you might
say to me is uh
Scott at least we don't have that
Chinese social credit system am I right
that would be pretty
bad imagine if the United States
implemented like the Chinese style
social credit where every little thing
you do gets added to the database of who
you are and you know it starts
restricting your rights if you get to a
certain
level
well let me give a uh alternative view
which is that the Chinese system might
be better than our system both are
terrible so I'm not I'm not supporting
the Chinese way I'm just saying if you
think it's worse than our system you're
not paying attention let me say
why if you jwalk in China you violate a
uh let's say a rule of
traffic um maybe it gets caught on a
camera and then it hurts your social
score but that's a real thing you did
you actually broke a real law now again
I'm not supporting the Chinese system
it's it's
terrible but it seems to be based or or
the intention is to base it on real
things you did it's not based on making
up I don't think now obviously they're
not going to talk out against the
government there so you know they don't
have that going for them uh but we don't
either you're allowed to say bad things
about the government so long as they're
not terribly
important but if you say bad things
about the government that
matter well maybe somebody's going to
whisper to your social media platform
that I really think you need to get rid
of this one because they not for the
things they said we don't like no no but
we look through the feed and we found
some things that look you know like they
might violate your terms of service so
you know even though we really hate the
the main thing that the person is saying
that's not why they're being canceled
because we have free
speech no it was the thing down like a
year ago they said uh you can't have
that on your platform so if I were you
i' get rid of that so no we do not have
any kind of free speech we haven't had
free speech for a long time the only way
you can say something even remotely
honest and true and useful is if you've
already been cancelled and you don't
give a that's not many people I
happen to be in that group so I thought
I'd tell you the truth
all right um so we got this uh
Department of Homeland Security guy May
orcus who's LED in millions of
people and he's bragging that they did
something that will reduce immigration
by 40% which I believe is something
similar to what Trump was doing which
means they could have done it all
along and they knew it of course they
knew it because all they did is take
away the executive orders that were
keeping you know the immigration low and
they knew that they were doing that so
if you remove the only tool that we'
figured out how to use so far that
reduces it and then it goes up that's
got to be seen as intentional so I would
say that mayorcas um should be seen as a
criminal and certainly a traitor to the
country and I think that's
obvious I I don't know how that could be
more obvious he is working
full-time to give the country not what
they want but rather some other thing
and is certainly bad for us you know at
the level that is happening I like my
immigration but at a lower
level so you got this guye of the
Department of Homeland Security and I
guess there's an amendment that just
passed the house to defund uh his
office now I don't know if that has a
chance of getting through the Senate
doesn't have any real chance of getting
signed by the president so it's more
symbolic I think but uh at least it's
something then you've got Garland
attorney general Garland who's in
contempt to Congress for ignoring
subpoenas or something like that uh so
he's the person or his group that wants
to put you know bid U banon in jail and
Peter Navaro is already in jail for the
same
stuff but apparently uh
he's Above the
Law literally he's just putting himself
Above the Law because that his his
Department won't prosecute and nobody
else's and then you've got Biden himself
who's clearly part of a larger crime
family situation I think that's well
demonstrated enough that we can say it
not humorous humorously that Biden ran
or he was the head person of a crime
crime family I think that's well enough
established that I can just say that we
all can see that that's a fact so we
have the most criminal government that
I've ever seen um I've never seen
anything like this where we're fully
aware of the
crimes is is this unprecedented where
the most important people in the
government are obviously criminals like
right in front of
you well as Democrats would say there's
no evidence of that
um how others have asked this too how
are the 51 Intel people who obviously
lied on the laptop story The Hunter
laptop Story how do they still have
security
clearance how do they still have jobs
some of
them it it's just the weirdest thing
that these crimes are being done right
in front of us this literally was a coup
there's no other way to put it I mean
maybe it wasn't illegal they may have
found a way to do it legally but it's
the most illegal thing you could ever do
whether or not it's technically illegal
I don't know it should
be so I I think this is one of those
cases where we just hung too long until
we got used to it how did we get used to
the fact that the major characters in
our in our government people whose names
we know and they still here on TV to
talk have done the worst things that
have ever happened to this country
unambiguously there's not really any
question about the
facts
weird well Democrats continue to think
that they can change Reality by changing
the definition of
words um so here's what they call the
the laptop coup now you and I would say
well if a bunch of intelligence people
colluded and the collusion is obvious in
the letter they got together and did a
thing together and there's no way that
they thought it was true
obviously um isn't that a traitorous
treasonous Behavior those are the words
I'd put on it but do you know what
Democrats would call
that they would call it oops we really
thought it looked like Russian
disinformation so they don't change any
of the
facts they just just put different words
on it and move on ah yeah probably big
mistake no it was a coup it changed the
outcome of civilization
intentionally it diverted the entire
Democratic
process no that wasn't just a
mistake anyway um and then of course
they did the same thing with the Russia
cusion hoax how are any of the people
involved in the Russia collusion hoax
still
working how do they have
jobs what's up with that that these are
the worst crimes against the American
people I mean they they literally
changed the the they essentially took
away your entire Republic right in front
of you there's nothing like it that's
left I guess things are just so weird
that we just get used to it but then
they can call the protest on January six
and Insurrection because to them words
are what matters now here's one of the
things that I was curious
about uh that I'm going to go to the
other side of the white board to talk
about which is how is it that Democrats
keep falling for these obvious
hoaxes and when I had a conversation
with Michael Ian Black he said something
that triggered what I think is the
answer how can they believe things that
are so insanely obviously not true you
wouldn't even have to research them
here's
how apparently the main evidence that
Democrats use to support their belief in
hoaxes and I'm not making this up are
the other
hoaxes so for
example um why would you ever believe
the people
hoax because even if you didn't do the
research to look at the transcript just
on the surface you should have said to
yourself okay well I don't think a
sitting president just praised
neo-nazis you know that I mean you
wouldn't have to research that would you
that obviously didn't happen you don't
even have to ask around but how would
you believe that so with with Michael
lean black when I was talking to him and
when I showed him the debunk you know
could you could see that the president
was
claiming that Trump had uh praised the
neo-nazis and then I showed that the the
Snopes site had debunked it as
fake um he responded that but you have
to see it in the larger
context and I said what what's the
larger context he goes well remember
when Trump came down the stairway and he
said that the uh Mexican
immigration was bringing in rapists and
murderers and they weren't sending their
best
people and I said wait a minute wait a
minute you can't support your belief in
the hoax by referring to another
hoax and then he would say that's not a
hoax and I would say well I didn't say
this but yeah I wish I
had what part of what Trump said was
racist when he talked about too many
coming
in because do you think that he would
have had a different opinion if they
were
Canadians if we had people streaming
across the border from Canada taking
American jobs and they all looked
exactly like Trump do you think you'd
say whoa whoa that's good they look like
me nobody believes
that has Trump ever said I'm really
against Crime well I mean except when
white people do it
no nobody says that nobody thinks it
it's not even a thing I've never met a
single person who would have the opinion
that you should open up the border to 25
million
Canadians well I mean they're white so
why not no nobody has that opinion that
Trump is ain't
nationalists United States is his frame
of reference no when he says too many
criminals are coming in it's hyperbole
first of all uh but there's too you know
more than zero is too many a lot of
people would reasonably say if it's
crime
so literally a hoax but why would you
believe in the first place that Trump
was talking about some kind of racial
thing when there was no mention of any
racial anything why would you believe
that well because you also believed the
central five
hoax so he had that sort of in his
reputation coming forward now if you're
watching this and you're a Democrat
you're say wait what hoax that actually
happened Trump actually said that those
five innocent people should be executed
because they're black no he
didn't nothing like that happened
nothing like that happened not in the
real world no there there was an
accusation against five young black
people that they were part of some Mass
horrible rape he did right after that
and probably I assume triggered by that
event ran a full page ad saying that uh
you know there are too many monsters and
criminals running around uh unchecked
and that we should Institute the death
penalty for the the worst of them never
mentioned the specific crime he just
used it probably was triggered by it but
it really wasn't even about those five
people and there's also some question
about how innocent they really were but
that's a separate question the point is
even if he was
wrong he wasn't talking about
him it was a general statement that
wasn't about those five people there was
just way too much crime in his opinion
so if you believe the central five uh
the Central Park five hoax then you are
already primed to believe the uh too
many rapists and criminals coming across
the border hoax if you believe those two
you were primed to think the fine people
hoax was
real and then by the time he referred to
some hole countries you said he
must be talking
racially why not because he ever
mentioned race because he didn't and not
because race was implied because it
wasn't he was talking about the you know
the economic educational you know
situation in other countries and if
they're coming in for more
industrialized high education countries
we're probably getting people who will
more immediately impact our economy in a
positive
way
so then by the time by the time you get
to let's see all right so
then how did anybody ever believe that
Trump once said to a
general that the people joining the
military that once died were suckers and
losers
now if you heard that a president said
that to a
general you would have said that didn't
happen why would anybody believe that it
was real that's that's like a president
saying that neo-nazis are fine people
you shouldn't need to D dig down and do
research that's obviously not
true it couldn't be more obvious that he
would never say that to a
general I I I think that's the most
obvious hoax in the world but why would
anybody believe
it well it's because they also believed
the framing of the media I'd call it a
hoax that when he made the joke about
McCain in which he said I like people
who don't get caught that's literally a
Chris Rock joke and it didn't really
have anything to do with any people in
the military he was literally just
mocking one guy about one thing and a
joke popped into his mind and he he
popped it out
the worst thing he did was say something
insensitive about
McCain but because the media said well
he must not like the people in the
military because look how he's treating
them that primes you to believe the
other one that was you know obviously
ridiculous on the
surface how do you get somebody to
believe that he once suggested drinking
bleach again you don't need to do your
research to know that that didn't happen
but if you say SC Scott okay I I agree
he didn't say bleach that word but he he
said disinfectant and you know and
that's the same
thing yes it would be the same thing
except it didn't happen the disinfectant
he talked about was light if you see it
in context it was obviously always light
he never changed the topic but he did
use the word disinfectant once in the
context of Light which is how others
used it as well now why would you
believe that well maybe believed it
because they told you that he once asked
about using a nuclear weapon to stop a
hurricane if you said if he's going to
talk about nuk in a hurricane he might
he might say drink some bleach now it
took me a long time to piece this
together that all of their
hoaxes are they know that the that the
hoax isn't exactly on point but they
think it's probably close enough because
of the other hoax as they
believe so they've created a hoax
architecture where you think you can
take out one of the pillars and it all
fall down but they're all supported by
the other hoaxes so every time you
debunk one they say as Michael Ian Black
did some version of
this you have to see it in the larger
context and the larger context is always
the other
hoaxes and that's the world you live in
now when I say that the government is a
hoax ocracy not a republic I mean that
literally uh the the main things we
believe about the world and the
government are literally
hoaxes so we have an entire civilization
built on known hoaxes speaking of
sketchy things uh V says that he has not
been asked to be vice
president uh there was a a hint that
Trump had flown into his town or
something so they thought
thought maybe maybe he had been asked
but he says he had not been asked
now let
me just have some fun with this V is not
a liar and so when he says uh I have not
been asked I think that's literally
true here's what's left out which makes
it
fun I bet he hasn't asked
anybody he said he picked
he didn't say he asked
anybody so don't conflate I haven't been
asked with it's not going to be me those
are not the same and notice how
carefully V picks his words now I think
it won't be him I think he won't be the
choice but he'd be a great choice but I
I think it won't be him because I think
he'd have more value somewhere else uh
in the government if if he
chooses but I think I I think that uh
the candidates and also Trump are
coordinating um let's say a show so I
think they're all aware they're putting
on a good show of hey wh which vice
president do you think he's going to
pick and you know who's it going to be
and I've got a hint that it might be V
but V denied it but is it a real denial
or is it really just a denial that he
was ask because that's kind of
specific I I just love this nobody but
Trump can do this you are so going to
miss this after Trump I love the fact
that he's treating it like it's a TV
show and it's so well scripted look like
a reality TV show where where there's a
little bit of non-reality that you know
gives it a structure the non-reality is
I think they all know to keep the
suspense and that is part of the show
it's kind of brilliant I just love every
part of it so um I saw that
stefanic was added to the short list at
least by one
publication so that would mean the
speculation is down to vake uh JD Vance
Senator Tim Scott Doug bergam Elis
stefanic and Marco Rubio so that's what
they're calling the short list does that
mean that he will pick somebody on the
short
list it does not it does not this is the
media short list how many people saw mic
Pence on the short
list I didn't I don't think the media
saw that one coming so I don't think
there's any way I don't think there's
any way to guess a VP but I'm going to
still agree with Simon attiba who just
for fun um he thinks Doug beram might be
the one and I say Doug beram is boring
enough and yet
substantial he might be the one so just
for fun I'm going to say Doug berham but
I tell you in advance my ODS of getting
this right are very low you no no better
than 10% it would just be luck if I did
nobody can guess vice
president all right the 538 polling
site um that used to be D Nate silver
site but I guess he sold it I think ABC
owns it
now and one of the things they do is
they
aggregate um a bunch of polls about the
presidential election so you can see the
average and according to them it's about
a tie if you look at the average of
polls it's roughly a tie between Biden
and Trump now does that agree with the
polling you've been seeing it doesn't
agree with the polling I've been seeing
so how can this big polling
site come up with an average of
polls that shows it's going to be a tie
how is that possible well it's not every
poll uh apparently they tossed out uh um
rasmason because they said it didn't
meet their
standards rasmon also consistently shows
that Trump is
ahead is that a coincidence do you think
that they looked at the other polls and
said you know based on the quality of
this poll I think I'll leave it out or
do you think maybe they only did that
for right leaning polls that have not
been unfriendly to
Trump so here's something if I teach you
just one thing about data
if you're doing something like averaging
together
polls the way you get the result you
want is by you in your own opinion
subjectively deciding which polls are
good enough to be in and which ones are
not good enough to be
in so it's not about the polls it's
about the person making the poll and
they will make it kind of do what they
want does that sound
familiar it's an average of
polls but they also get to decided which
ones are in the average what what's that
remind you
of something
else climate
models a climate
model the people who put together the
average of the climate
models just like this they get to decide
which models are good
enough which means you've never seen
anything like climate models you've seen
the opinion of the people who compile
them
that's
it to imagine you're seeing science is
actually really naive because it's not
even trying to be science science
doesn't predict the future in 80 years
that's not
science that's some kind of speculation
that might be informed by data or
science but it's not
science yeah it's the person picking
what's in and what's out and then beyond
that they also pick which variables to
emphasize and that's why they're
different models so yeah the the
modeling is so transparently fake that
it's laughable that anybody was ever
convinced by
it meanwhile Nate silver the actual Nate
silver who is Credible in my opinion not
right every time but credible he says
there's a 67 66% chance of trump winning
so uh two and a three chance that Trump
is going to win the election and I like
I like that way to express it when you
say here's the average of the
polls you if you show if you show the
average of the polls and it shows one
person is likely to win and then they
don't you start thinking the polls were
wrong not necessarily but the way Nate
silver goes about it is he says there's
a
66% chance of winning which is a
different frame so if he says there's a
two-thirds chance of trump winning but
then Biden wins is he
wrong here's the question if Nate says
there's a Nate silver says there's a two
out of three
chance that Trump will win and then he
doesn't was he
wrong
no he wasn't wrong he said there was a
two and a three chance now he might have
been wrong but not because Biden won
Biden winning doesn't say anything about
whether he was right or wrong because
that was one of the outcom he said was
at least a one-third possibility so if
if a one-third possibility comes through
nobody's really surprised right so
that's a better way to frame
it um it hides your mistakes but it's
also a more honest
way so the Biden campaign as you've all
noted and I think even the Democrats
have noted is maybe the worst
presidential campaign in history now
much that is the candidate himself he's
not fully functional so there's just so
much you can do with him but I would say
it's it's really obvious at this point
that the campaign is
incompetent and there are plenty of
Democrats who are saying the same thing
it's just really obviously incompetent
and they've got a new ad that's out and
it's not even worth talking about it
looks like a high school
project so compare the political ads
from Trump which are sometimes hilarious
and sometimes just have soaring you know
feel and music and you know imagery like
uh we're we're back
America they're really well done and and
I'll I'll I think I'll probably say it
every day until the
election the level of improvement in the
Trump campaign compared to other prior
runs is so obvious I would love love
love love to know the inside story of
who is let's say most influential um
advisers are because remember Trump was
the candidate in the other cases too and
it's his job to pick the best
advice um you know he may have had
limited options the first two times he
seems to have better options now so he
seems to be getting great advice but
also great
execution um I think Lara Trump is a
superstar I think whoever does his
videos is better than anything I've ever
seen in the political Realm
uh his speeches are
perfect you know for what they're trying
to do uh and his messaging he's calmed
down his messaging here's the here's
what I think is
funny the uh Democrats have this
strategy of trying to get under Trump's
skin so that he will exhibit a behavior
that people will say this chaos he's
unstable he's a dictator look at that
chaos do you know why they think that's
a good
strategy why do they think it's a good
strategy to get under Trump's skin and
make him act like a crazy
man there's one
reason they brainwashed themselves into
thinking he's a chaos guy which he never
was even close to it they brainwashed
themselves to believe that he can't
control his presentation based on the
situation we've watched him for 70 years
crafting his presentation to the
situation perfectly
consistently for 70 years he he he meets
the opportunity with the right
presentation if you put him in a
situation where the fake news is just
giving him the business he knows that
fighting back you know giving that some
energy that's going to look good it's
going to be popular with the Bas and it
will be based on real
so he's going to fight back you put him
uh you put him behind the scenes and you
have a bunch of people who aren't doing
what he tells him to do and then you
hear that he went off on him and he
yelled at them and he like like he just
went off on him that's what we want him
to do we we I want my president if he
tells somebody to do something and they
just won't do it or they oh I got
problems I want him to just go
off on them I don't want him to say well
you got good reasons I guess we'll have
to not do that no he needs to fire them
or yell at them scare them motivate them
whatever it takes he just needs to get
it done and I've never seen anybody who
was better at changing his presentation
for the situation right you know there
there there's no time when he invited a
world leader to the White House and the
cameras are going and then he went off
on the world leader
ever never never because I wouldn't be
smart there there's not one situation
which anybody's even heard of that's
real uh that would suggest he would just
go crazy but you know who might believe
he
would somebody who believed he staged in
Insurrection they might believe he would
do something crazy but he didn't that's
just Democrat propaganda somebody who
believes that he tried to strangle the
driver of his own car on January
6 would think he might be
unstable but that didn't actually happen
that was fake news the drive according
to the
driver so you could go down right down
the line did he stand in front of the
public and say that the neo-nazis were
fine people no that was a hoax but the
Democrats believe it so just hold this
in your mind how funny this is
the entire Democrat debate
strategy from his Dei
staff is that he's got to treat
Trump as if all of their propaganda were
true but it's
not it's just the best trap in the world
all all Trump has to do is just show up
and be
Trump he doesn't even have to adjust
because there was never any truth to the
claims that he's crazy and chaotic and
can't control himself in every given
situation there's no evidence of that
over 70 years
so I think this is the funniest thing
ever that they fell for their own hoaxes
and falling for their own hoaxes allowed
them to come up with a um a strategy
that can't possibly work that the odds
of that working would require him to
turn into a different person before it
happened
since when has Trump ever turned into a
different person never never he's always
Trump that's the one thing you could be
sure of so that's hilarious anyway the
new ad looks like a high school
project and I said that uh you know it's
obviously a incom massive incompetence
problem we can all see it even the
Democrats see the incompetence in the
campaign and it's somewhat obvious that
Dei is the problem
problem would you say that's a fair
statement I'll give you some details but
you'd agree with that that the Biden
campaign is being destroyed by the very
thing they tell us is good for the
country more
Dei clearly his campaign is a Dei driven
campaign because the David Axel rods and
the people who know what the
they're doing are totally frozen out
sorry old white guy we got a young black
guy who's really nailing it
so am I saying something bad about black
people no absolutely not I wouldn't do
that and that's there's nothing in this
story that would suggest that because
here's the
test if di was only about promoting
redheads you know white people that's
about as white as you can get if you're
a redhead if Dei were only about you
know making sure you had good
representation of redheads
it would destroy the
system because there are not enough
redheads but everybody would need one
because if they couldn't prove they
didn't have a
redhead then they'd have to answer to
their bosses their bosses have to
support the narrative from the Democrats
so if the Democrats say you have to do
this redheaded hiring stuff we're not
going to accept that there weren't
enough of them you're going to have to
hire redheads that can't do the job and
hope for the best
so if you could replace the people in
the story with redheads such as they're
sending too many redheads across the
border and some of them have criminal
backgrounds then you know it wasn't
racist let's call it the redhead test
the redhead test is if you if you switch
out the black people in the story or the
lgbtq or the women in the story The
Hispanics in the story whoever whoever
is your your diversity Target if you
switch out and just replace it with a
red head does it look exactly the
same and it would di would look exactly
the same it's a supply and demand
problem on top of human motivation to
not be fired so you're going to hire the
redhead no matter what their
qualifications are and you're going to
put them in charge of the engine
development on your boing
airplane and then it's going to fall out
of the sky by the way I don't think
that's the problem with Boe
I'm just using them as an example
there's no there's no indication that
there's any Dei problem at
BO there is an indication that if they
continue pursuing Dei which they say
they are it's guaranteed to make a plane
fall out of the
sky guaranteed the only thing we don't
know if any of that's happened yet that
would be unfair to say but it's
guaranteed because the system design is
such that it can only go in One
Direction
all right let's do a little uh survey of
what the Biden campaign is telling us is
true and important to the
election you got the fine people hoax
the drinking bleach hes the suckers and
Liars hoax the January 6 Insurrection
hoes you've got two impeachment show
trials you got the immigration Bill hoax
you know the one where they say if only
Trump had not killed our immigration
Bill we we'd have a closed border no
that's just the talking point Trump
didn't kill it you you ended his his
executive orders Trump didn't need that
law to close the border is so you don't
need it either it's
OES um there's the inflation is down but
really that's just how you carve the
numbers there's the jobs are better
under Biden but not really it's because
he's counting the pandemic like it was a
normal year there's the Biden is a yeah
he might look a little unsteady in
public but behind closed doors he's a
genius which is stupid and
you're just insulting my intelligence to
imagine that he's all okay behind closed
doors that's not
happening um he's saying things that are
ridiculous like Trump is going to put
your democracy at risk when he's been
lawf fared tried to keep him off the
ballot tried to put him in
jail uh and may or may not have rigged
an election they say that he thinks he
wants to be dictat for a day which is
just pretending they don't understand
how language works or the context of it
they say he's the C chaos candidate
although there's no evidence whatsoever
that that's ever happened or anything
like it they say he might fire Rachel
madow and put it in a camp which is
 they think that white
supremacists are forming a army up in
the hills but nobody can find one they
think the militaries might have a little
problem but they couldn't find any in
there they say no one is above the law
while they're law faring the
people's pants off they say Ukraine is
about protecting the Democracy from
Putin which is a transparent lie we know
that Hunter's laptop was not exactly
real you we know that
the fake impeachments are and
so is those show
trials and we know that they've
weaponized the Department of
Justice so what do Biden's uh lawfare
dogs tell us
today they tell us that if you don't
agree with accepting the election before
you see the results if you don't agree
in advance that it's fair no matter what
it looks like he even if the outcome was
hey Biden got 99% of the votes even in
that condition the Democrats are telling
you that complaining would be
inappropriate no matter how obvious the
the rigging of the election now I don't
know if the election was rigged I don't
have any proof of that I'm I'm just
telling you it should look like it was
rigged and that a reasonable person
could say you know there's a lot of
[Music]
unstandardised the elections certainly
you know Zuckerberg money affected it
certainly some sketchiness with the mail
and ballots affected it certainly the
not checking signatures probably had a
little
effect um but the law dogs say that no
matter how obvious it is um that you
should go to jail
basically that's me paraphrasing uh you
should be punished in some way if you
believe that an obviously rigged
election is obviously rigged and you say
it out loud because you're free speech
they're trying to make sure that free
speech is not even tempting don't even
try your free speech because if you say
it obviously looks rigged it doesn't
matter if it does obviously look rigged
what's important is you said it can't
say it
and so apparently the uh the lawyers
against Trump are using the fact that he
once said he wouldn't accept the results
automatically as evidence that he
planned an Insurrection if he didn't
win are those the same saying that you
won't automatically accept an election
without knowing what it looks like is
that the same as saying you planned an
Insurrection no you idiots
that's not even close but they're going
to watch this debate debate to get more
law fair that apparently they are to
watch more to get more law fair zingers
against them because we live in a fair
country in which nobody's Above the
Law
anyway um here are some things that
voters in America are being told number
one our elections are secure and there's
no evidence of any rigging at a national
level you know nothing that would change
the outcome so we're told the elections
are
secure and that we know that the way we
can know that is because our elections
are fully
auditable so you can be quite sure
because they're fully auditable right so
that's what they tell us they also tell
us that we need to make changes to our
system so that it can be
audited it's already fully auditable
that's how we know they're secure but we
got to make some real big changes in
lots of states and lots of different
ways because it's not
secure it's Totally
Secure but we got a some really big
changes we've better make to make it
secure while it's already
secure they're telling us that right in
front of
us now there's no such thing as a secure
election there is only such a thing as
you got a result and people accepted it
or they
didn't there is no way to know if a
state actor that is capable of hacking
the Iranian nuclear
program as one example or the Chinese
hackers who are allegedly already inside
our most secure infrastructure in the
United States according to our own
experts how in the world would you know
if they co-opted an Insider and covered
their tracks of course you
wouldn't but the idiot Democrats who are
just a
hoaxy you know running the country have
decided that they can tell you that it's
secure while also telling you at the
same time they have to make some big
changes because it's not
secure
okay
um and then uh my favorite uh rid ulous
story uh Joel PO is writing about this
in Breitbart there's a billionaire Hamas
official uh they said although Gaza is
destroyed um that's not all bad news
because it's the first step toward
Liberation how do you deal with an enemy
who kind of likes death and thinks that
a noble death is your best situation
because then you get you know get your
virgins and you get your paradise and
stuff
it's the weirdest situation where
they're glad that they're being killed
because they're sure that feels like
winning I don't feel like it's even
unethical to kill somebody who thinks
it's better they're better
off it it's sort of a gray area wait let
explain this again you you believe that
life is better after death oh yes yeah
the the whole deal is we're playing for
the afterlife that that's the big game
you know this this life stuff is
important
but you know afterlife is permanent so
that's that's the big game
so if I killed you while you were in the
service of trying to you know Chase
something for your religion uh or any
other reason you would have the best
possible
outcome yes yes I would I mean I
wouldn't be helpful here on Earth
anymore but it would be the best outcome
for me I'd be living with God and it'd
be
great I'm not so sure it's unethical to
kill that
person I don't know it's a little bit of
a gray area giving somebody what they
want more than anything in the
world an honorable
death it it's hard to feel bad about
that now you might say bu Scott bu Scott
that those are the people fighting is it
is it just the
fighters if you took the 10 year olds
who have been through their brainwashing
and you just separated them and say all
right your parents aren't watching
you're 10 years old you know what do you
think about dying as a murty oh good
stuff I cannot wait to die I am so
looking forward to dying as a martyr I
can't even wait and you talk to Mom you
say did you do this well I mean I didn't
do it the schools did it but you know I
agree with it
what you agree do it so even you're okay
with your child dying yeah I mean if
it's a if he's doing the right stuff he
goes to heaven good
stuff I don't
know now obviously the uh the people
from Gaza are not of one mind and so I'm
you know it's a parody of of a imaginary
person so don't assume that they're all
like that or they all feel the same way
but you're fighting a group that's
presenting itself as a unified thing and
that unified thing seems to want to
die
literally so I'm going to say it
again it's a tragedy when you know
anybody's being killed so as a human
being I see it as a
tragedy but if you going to look at it
politically it's hard to feel sorry for
a group of people who prefers death you
know in the in the context of fighting
for something better and it's hard to
follow somebody who gives them what they
want under that condition if the
alternative is that you're going to be
dead and you're not crazy about that
idea so you have a situation I'll need a
I'll need a religious check on this can
somebody give me a fact check on
this is it true that if you're Jewish
you don't believe in the afterlife per
se you know not not a heaven with
virgins and stuff you're you're more
about what's happening while you're
alive is that fair to say or do I have a
mischaracterization and would it be fair
to say that uh
Islam has the opposite emphasis you know
the the worldly stuff is important but
you're really playing for the
afterlife so how do two people live in
peace when one thinks that uh the
afterlife is the important part and the
other think thinks that the being here
is the important part draw that up on
paper
just draw that on paper and act like
you've never heard of you know Israel or
Gaza just on paper you got two enemies
one likes to be dead one likes to be
alive you know I'm summarizing but
that's basically it where is that going
to
end the incentive system is very clear
the ones who want to stay alive will do
everything in their power to kill the
ones who want to be
dead and so they both win yeah see the
the mistake that observers make is that
there could be a win-win if they make
peace it's a win-win if you both have
the same idea of where the the payoff is
if you think the payoff is during life
you're not going to find a way to
compromise with somebody who thinks the
payoff is
afterlife I don't think that's doable I
mean not in the long run in the short
run you can you know use the reality of
threats to do
things but on paper
Israel should eventually kill everybody
who believes that it might take a
while but if both people want the same
thing I want to kill you so you don't
kill me and you want to be dead I think
we could work out an arrangement and
apparently that's what Gaza is it's a
bunch of people in Gaza too many of them
again not all of them there's no group
that are all the same but Gaza said hey
I think we'd rather be dead than what's
going on now
and Israel said you know kind of agree
with that I think you would rather be
dead we'd be happy with that
too so every time somebody says why
don't they get together and resolve
their
differences I I sit here and think what
differences I don't see the difference
one side wants to be dead and the other
side wants to kill them for very good
reasons how am I supposed to feel about
that why why should should I get
involved in
that now if I if that sounded a little
too pro
Israel let me balance it out a little
bit I don't give a about your
Holocaust period I don't give a
about your Holocaust don't tell me that
I have to make decisions based on your
Holocaust A lot of people have had Hard
Times also don't give a about your
slavery I really don't I don't care at
all I don't care and if you're looking
at the past I don't care that much about
you you're you're not somebody I want to
spend a lot of time with if you want to
figure out how to start from wherever
you are and I will acknowledge we're not
starting from the same places there is
systemic racism it's real we're not
starting from the same places if you'd
like to figure out how to optimize your
situation in the future I'm all in I
wrote a book on it ask me some advice
I'll give it to you I'll tell you how to
maximize your situation in the system
you find yourself in I'm all in on that
if Israel says how do we start today and
build like a really good civilization
all in I'm all in I don't want to care I
don't want to hear about your
Holocaust it's exactly as bad as you say
it is I don't care stop making me care I
don't care don't care about your slavery
don't care about your
Holocaust you're not going to make me
care I can be your friend and I can help
you in every way that that I can
possibly do
it but don't make me care about
well it's not and the sunlit
it's important and it happened but don't
make me care about
it it's just not helping you and it's
not helping
me all right so that is my provocative
show for today it's going to be lit
let's see if the uh needle gets moved by
the
uh the debate my prediction is Trump
will not become chaotic but they'll find
at least one thing he says that they'll
sell as chaos because they're so
committed to finding it yeah if you hire
ghost hunters because you think there's
a ghost in the house they're going to
find one because they're Ghost Hunters
it doesn't matter if there's a ghost
there they're Ghost Hunters they got
paid to find a ghost they're going to
find a ghost if you think that chaos is
going to be there and you're in the
press and you think it's your job to
point it out you're going to find some
chaos even if it's not there so you can
guarantee that something will happen
that they will call chaos and that you
and I will look at it and say are you
kidding me that just looks like another
hoax to add to your hoax
oy so that's
guaranteed you can guarantee that even
if uh Biden falls asleep and falls out
of his chair has a stroke
that the CNN and MSNBC people will say
you know what that was a lot better than
we were expecting I'd call that a win he
beat
expectations yeah so to imagine that
there's going to be a killshot in the
debate I think is optimistic although
it's fun it's not impossible yeah there
there's a nonzero chance of a total kill
shot and here's what I
think I think Trump's strategy is is
going to be to get under Biden's skin
but not in the normal Trump way which
would be a little over the
top I think he's going to just slide it
in look look for the kill shot to be
said in mild
tones all right here's here's not a this
would not be a Kill Shot your whole
family is a bunch of criminals that's
not a Kill
Shot not at all here's a Kill
Shot he said the election was rigged he
was rigged here's a Kill
Shot does anybody know why we have
election
machines they don't make things
faster they're not more
credible they're not
cheaper they're not
easier why do we have them the only
reason I can think of is for the purpose
of rigging
election now I'm not saying that that
will be the one who uses I'm I'm just
saying that the
killshot is going to be the one he
says in a matter of fact way that will
be the kill shot because if you really
want to get under his skin you don't
want to make it a shouting match because
he'll just
shout like if if you go you're a
criminal he's just going to yell back ah
you're a
criminal so you got to say that factual
the the factual thing that nobody can
argue against which is we don't know a
reason why voting machines
exist there might be one by the way but
it's the fact that we don't know what it
is we the
public all
right um so I don't think there'll be a
result but I also don't think that the
election will give us a a result either
I'd be very surprised if we think we've
actually had an election and the and a
president was picked fair and square
whoever loses is going to say it was
rigged and it might be I I think it's
entirely likely actually all right
that's all for now I'm going to say
goodbye to uh YouTube and Rumble and X
I'm going to talk to my beloved locals
subscribers for the extra thanks for
joining and we'll see you some of you
tonight at the debate it's going to be
fun
