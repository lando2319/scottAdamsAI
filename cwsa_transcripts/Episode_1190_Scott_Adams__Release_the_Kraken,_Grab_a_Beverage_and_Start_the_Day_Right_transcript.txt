hey everybody
come on in come on in gather around it's
time
yes it's time for coffee with scott
adams
best part of the day every time
every single time no exceptions
and i know some of you are waiting to
fast forward
past the simultaneous sip for some of
you
it's annoying but for the rest of you
it's an amazing ceremony it's a bonding
thing
you feel closer to people all around the
world yeah
that's that's how important it is and
all you need is a copyright glass of
tanker towels or stein a canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the
other day the thing that makes
everything better except for election
recounts
it happens now go
i can feel the election getting more
accurate every moment all right let's
talk about
all the things many things are happening
and we shall discuss them
um i guess the border patrol seized
enough fentanyl at our border to kill
200 000 people that's right
there was enough fentanyl in one
shipment to kill 200
000 people of course it comes from china
and i would like to reiterate my call
for ending relations with china until
they execute their
fentanyl dealers now the china knows who
their fentanyl dealers are
we have named them they know who they
are they know where they live etc
and apparently they're allowed to be
operating
continually without any penalty and i
think china can do what they want to do
but we should do what we want to do
which is
uh send all of their diplomats home
so what i would do is i would actually
and i recommend this
send 100 of chinese diplomats home
until they can show us that they've
arrested and stopped the fentanyl
and if after 30 days you know give them
30 days to
do that send all their diplomats home
after 30 days
and then wait another 30 days and if
they still haven't
corrected that um should send all of
their students home
so i don't know how many students are
physically attending college in the
united states
during coronavirus but they we should
just send them all home
just every one of them and don't make it
personal
because it doesn't have to be it's just
business
if you're sending us fentanyl we're
sending you back all of your diplomats
if if you continue doing it we'll send
you back all of your students
we don't want to it's not our first
choice
but it's not like they're giving us much
choice
and it would be extra delicious to uh
for president trump to bind
biden to whatever whatever trump does
before he leaves office
with china how in the world are we ever
going to trust
joe biden to negotiate with china
it doesn't even feel like a thing does
it is there anything that joe biden
could negotiate with china that would
make
at least half of the country say oh yeah
that looks like a pretty good deal
i think joe biden pushed them as hard as
he could
probably got the maximum deal that you
could get out of china
literally nobody will think that and and
half the country will think it's treason
so i don't know how biden can
um win with what
all the smart people say is the biggest
issue with the united states
going forward which is how do you deal
with an emerging china
so we'll talk about that a little bit
more um
i always hear people say that masks
don't work
claim lots of people and they say
but show me the proof if you believe
that mass work
show me the study oh oh there's no study
oh scott you don't have any studies oh
so this morning there was a study
showing that masks
do work according to one study
now if you watch my periscopes or my
live streams
on youtube you know that i always warn
you that
studies um studies even studies that
look like they're
well done at first maybe 50
50 chance that they're real at most
i would say when you hear that a study
proved
whatever it's sort of a coin flip
you know a study proved maybe 50 percent
likely that it could be reproduced
but the study says masks work and the
way they looked at it was
they looked at people who were handling
coronavirus people they looked at people
who wore masks they compared them to the
people who did not
to which i say wait there were people
handling
handling coronavirus who didn't wear
masks
what so i don't know how you get that
group of people who didn't wear masks
but apparently they exist and they
studied them and they found that the
the people who didn't wear the masks had
substantially higher
infections and again it's one study
50 percent chance that any study is true
but let me let me just wrap it up this
way
i don't think you should believe that
study or
any other study um you know in
in isolation you need you need a body of
work before you should believe something
but those saying there are no studies
i would like to add that there are so
now there's at least one so you can't
say there are no studies
but you can certainly say you don't
believe them media matters came after me
you were probably waiting for that
weren't you what took them so long
so media matters uh seems to have
put me in their crosshairs i'm on the
radar
you might say if you don't know who
media matters is it's a
left-leaning disreputable website
where they make lots of claims against
trump supporters etc
so here's how they went after me they in
their article they note that i
and a number of other people i think
laura ingram was in there
but we were accused of retweeting
a tweet from someone who had made
tweets that they think are racist in the
past
so media matters is calling me out by
name
writing a big article to associate me
with a website
that has made what they consider
offensive and or racist
tweets in the past now
how many people who
use twitter think that that's a thing
that's not a thing i think media matters
is confusing
facebook with twitter let me explain
this to media matters
if i'm on facebook and i do decide to
friend a white supremacist well that's
something you should probably worry
about
you might even write an article about it
oh my goodness
somebody friended a racist
and i think that could be part of a
conversation
i would say that's not nothing you know
your associations
are part of the story right but
twitter isn't facebook if i retweet you
you're not my friend
if you retweet content from somebody's
twitter feed
you're not really becoming their friend
it doesn't have that meaning it's just
the content
so the way that medium editors turns a
nothing
into a something is by assuming that
people don't use twitter
enough to understand that retweeting
something
doesn't mean anything it has no meaning
it doesn't mean you know it doesn't mean
you researched
the original tweeter doesn't mean that
it means you looked at the content and
you said oh that's some content that my
followers
should see you or might like that's it
that that's the twitter model
you do not acquire the reputation of
people you retweet
and let me explain it this way if you
acquired the reputation of the people
you retweeted how could you even
understand your world
it would mean everybody on twitter who's
retweeting they're acquiring everybody's
reputation
and you wouldn't know who anybody was at
that point
let me tell you uh what percentage of
people i retweet
who i would consider uh horrible
in at least one way okay so
if if this site i i retweeted has some
bad retweets in their past let's say for
my my conversation that they're horrible
in at least one way
that doesn't mean they're mean to pets
right
it means that they're horrible in
exactly one way allegedly
i don't know myself but allegedly
they're horrible in this one way
how many people have i retweeted in my
lifetime
who were horrible in at least one way
all of them every one of them
you know i'm pretty sure if i dug into
your private lives
oh i'd find something i'd find something
even if you're 99 lovely you could be
delightful people
pretty much law abiding you could be all
of that
but i'll bet i can find at least one
thing you've all done
that's pretty bad that one thing
so do i acquire all of your mistakes
if i retweet you do i pick up all of
your flaws
do they become part of me because i
retweeted you
so media matters is silly and we're
going to ignore them
um i would also like to point out and i
will return to this
point often i think that a lot of what
we've
in society we've decided to label as
racist
is better described as offensive
because people can be offensive
intentionally they can be offensive
unintentionally
without being racist would you agree
that that statement is true
that you could be offensive both
uh both intentionally and sometimes
accidentally
without necessarily being a racist
right so if you look at a lot of the
claims you'll find that the claims fall
into that category of being
offensive but clearly not racist
and i think that we should make that
distinction really really clear
because it would solve 70 percent of our
problems
did i offend you oh i'm sorry
that wasn't the point the point was not
to offend you
it's my opinion but i don't mean it to
offend you
so i think you can apologize for being
offensive
even if it's an accident why not you're
we're social people we live in the world
we try to
get along you should certainly certainly
apologize for accidentally offending
somebody that doesn't mean you won't do
it again
it doesn't mean they own you it doesn't
mean you're a bad person but
sure apologies are good social lubricant
i think they're appropriate quite often
rasmussen has
shared some information that i think
will be available to the rest of you
today sometime
that apparently opinions about china are
worsening
where uh now 60 of americans think that
china should pay some kind of
reparations or something because of the
coronavirus
and that's that's up
from uh what
42 that's a pretty big pretty big change
but here's the part that got my interest
33 percent of americans now consider
china an enemy of the united states what
do you think
that was in march of 2018 so it's 33
i think china is an enemy today what was
it
two years ago 18
so it went from 18 of americans thought
china is an enemy
to 33 percent do you know what happened
in 2018
that's when china killed my stepson with
fentanyl
and it was the time that i promised you
i was going to
take china down
now of course i've been
talking crap about china for two years
and probably just a coincidence
that that turned out to be the high
point of china's
goodwill with the united states and it
has gone straight down
since then now it could be
could be that there are a lot more
voices talking out against china and of
course the coronavirus is
probably the biggest deal that's
happening in that regard
but uh i would like to say that i am
part of the productive change in opinion
from china being our
frenemy to being our enemy and i would
consider them
our enemy as of today well
since 2018 in my case all right
black lives matter founder co-founder
has made it clear to biden that
black lives matter expects something
because they they say that they help to
get the black vote for biden and they
want something in return
they want something in return but
luckily
joe biden is no president trump
so when black lives matter says we'd
like to guess something in return
they can depend on joe biden to come
through
just the way democrats have been coming
through for the black population for
decades
for example here are some of the
important things that joe biden
has promised the black community and i
think they can be pretty happy about
this
pretty happy because you'd think hey i
wonder if the democrats will
once again make promises and do
basically nothing
unlike president trump who literally
promised
nothing and did a whole bunch of things
everything from the platinum plan to
special
opportunity zones and funding the hb
historically black colleges to prison
reform
so the president he didn't promise
anything he said what the hell do you
have to lose
that's as little as you can promise
that's no promise
and he delivered what even even his uh
critics grudgingly say okay gotta admit
that's a lot of stuff
so president trump delivered for the the
black population in this country
even including his critics agree but
biden can take that up a level so he's
made some promises and let me tell you
what he's promised
and uh this is nothing to sneeze at so
pre
biden has promised that as president he
would
create a police oversight board to
combat
police brutality especially against
black and minority people
within the first hundred days in the
white house so if you were worried
that biden was going to do nothing
don't worry anymore because he's going
to
put together a police oversight board
i don't know why nobody thought of that
before put together a little committee
huh how about that yeah
so i think the black population is
pretty happy about that
because nobody ever promised to put a
meeting together
but that's not all there's way more than
that biden has also promised to create
an economic plan
that provides housing education and
financial support those are all good
things
housing education financial support this
is good stuff
that joe biden is planning to give
and he says as financial support to the
black and latino
communities who have been
disproportionately affected by the
corona
pandemic wait what
am i reading this correctly that joe
biden is going to give
emergency relief based on your race
does is that actually happening joe
biden decided that your race
would determine how much emergency
support you get
isn't that the opposite of what a
president should do
that's like exactly the opposite isn't
it
shouldn't the president make sure that
everybody who's in trouble during a
pandemic gets help sort of
close to equal amount of help now i
don't know if this is talking about
an equal amount of help or some kind of
a special help
if what it's getting at is an equal
amount of help i'm all for it
but it doesn't sound like that does it
so joe biden's got some promises he
needs to keep
i think he has duped the black voters
as the democrats have been doing for
years
but successfully looks like he got away
with it
if you're wondering what the future
holds for this recount
business with the election do you wonder
how it's going to turn out
is it going to turn out that the
election is overturned
seems highly unlikely doesn't it or is
it going to turn out that
there's just not really much fraud there
or maybe a little bit of fraud but not
enough to change anything
don't you wonder how it's all going to
turn out well i'm going to narrow the
options for you
there's one potential outcome that i
think doesn't have any chance of being
true
here are the ones that do have a chance
of being true
one is that there is a little bit of
fraud
some anecdotes but the election stands
would you agree that it's at least
possible
right you might think that that's
unlikely because you think the election
was stolen or something
but wouldn't you agree it's possible i
mean it's possible
that you look into it you don't find
much right
it's it's still possible even though
we'll talk about sydney powell and the
voting machines and
we'll talk about all the allegations and
the strange data i'll get to that
but at this point it's still possible
right that they could look into it and
not find much
would you agree or no because i'm
interested
if you would at least agree that it's
possible
even if you think the odds are pretty
low so i'd say it's possible
here's the other possibility that we
find that
the there's not only fraud but there's
massive fraud throughout the election
system
so much so that maybe we've never had
a fair election now do you think that's
possible
you don't have to put an odds on it yet
just say
is there any possibility that when
when we do these audits and look into it
that what we discover
is it's not just bad it's so bad
that we couldn't even imagine how bad it
was i mean it's like unimaginably
corrupt do you think that's even
possible
is there any chance that it's so corrupt
that we didn't even have
a democracy or a public and we thought
we did
is it possible i think it is i think it
is
i don't know what odds to put on it but
i'd say that's
possible so those are the two things
that i say are
are possible we find out there always
has been massive fraud including this
time
we find out that things have actually
been pretty good
not much fraud at all i'd say that's
possible
um but are there any any possibilities
that uh
that don't exist i think the possibility
that
um
the the possibility whether
let me let me get to biggest point
i don't see really
much chance that they're not going to
find massive fraud
do you if you if you want to go further
and put some odds on it
i would say the what's going to happen
is that some people who have an idea
about the country they live in
and the their reality is going to change
a lot
all right so in my case if i were to
learn
that despite the fact that these
elections are full of holes
meaning there are lots of opportunities
to cheat we'll talk about those two
but i can't understand any world in
which
lots of people are involved there's a
huge upside potential for cheating
lots of ways to do it and that it
doesn't happen
in a major way so my
my understanding of reality will be
completely
destroyed if it turns out
that the right people look into it and
don't find anything
and don't find anything significant
anyway my whole life
understanding of people how the world
works
uh how big systems work how big
organizations work
literally the thing i spend my life
writing about
i would all be wrong about all of that
it would completely annihilate my
understanding of reality
so that could happen here's the other
possibility
all the people who think that they've
been living in a democracy slash
republic with something like fair
elections
it's never happened it's
possible we've never had a fair election
in fact if i had to put odds on it
when i say never you know people get
caught up on the absolutes so let me
pull it back from an absolute
it doesn't mean that the person who got
the most voter support never won
because i'm sure that sometimes people
win even if the other side cheats
that's probably happening but i would
bet
i would bet that pretty much
all of our major elections anything that
involves a
a city at least probably corrupt
and maybe always have been and maybe we
just don't know
so i think that's the big reality twist
that's coming we shall see
um as the dilbert guy the guy who writes
about big organizations and
what people do in big organizations the
election
is like a big organization and if i'm
wrong about this
uh my my whole career is sort of a joke
because all i write about is how when
there's a big organization
bad stuff happens every time it doesn't
sometimes happen
it's every time every single time
all right um
there's some research on mouthwash
that apparently there's some kind of
mouthwash that has this particular
ingredient
uh which watch me now try to pronounce
it
cedilpyridinitium cerapido peridinium
i think i nailed it if you've got that
sarah periodium chloride
in your mouth watch it it has promising
signs of reducing
covid so i use mouthwash several times a
day but i have to check if i have that
if i have that ingredient by the way if
you
smoke marijuana and do mouthwash
directly afterwards it gets rid of your
munchies that's a little tip for you
so it so if i get coronavirus
uh that would be a miracle because i use
a lot of mouthwash
all right um does it seem to you that
joe brydon sort of
evolved into that guy who complains at
every meeting
that there's no plan have you been
have you worked for a big organization
or even a small one
there's always somebody at the meeting
whose only comment
is going to be that there is no plan
where is the plan
or where's our strategy same thing
where's our plan
i think joe biden became that where's
the planned guy
because he keeps complaining that the
president has no plan to distribute
the vaccine do you think that's true
the president assigned the top logistics
guy in the military
to make a plan all right so this is the
part we know
is true that trump picked the top
logistics guy in the military
to make a plan to figure out how to get
all these
vaccines to people in the quickest time
joe biden says there's no plan
which of those do you think is true do
you think if the top
military guy who's in charge of
logistics
and he's literally charged with saving
the country
that's his job the guy whose job it is
to get those vaccines to people
he's he's saving how many lives will he
save if he does a good job
so joe biden thinks that guy isn't doing
it
right that's what joe biden says there's
no plan
i got a feeling that if you assign a
logistics
job the most important one in the
country
there's nothing else going on that's
that important for logistics is there
nothing even close so it's the most
important goal
given to exactly the right person the
logistics guy
in the military it's the military
this isn't wally it's not like you give
an assignment to somebody in a cubicle
and they tell you a week later they were
busy and they didn't get around to it
it's the military when the
commander-in-chief tells somebody in the
military to give me a plan for logistics
i'm pretty sure they're making a plan
just because joe biden hasn't seen it
that doesn't make it not a plan
i think it's hilarious that kamala
harris is getting security briefings
because she's a senator but biden does
not
so so you already see it happening that
joe biden is already being left out of
decisions
not exactly but but you can see like the
first hint of it
oh yeah we're giving security briefings
to kamala harris
but there's a reason it's not because
joe biden isn't the real president
we have a reason is because she's a
senator
and you know he's not an elected
official so
the president has to give him that
authority and he hasn't
so it makes sense but i'm kind of
wondering will we see
other examples in which the vice
president
knows more than the the president elect
um
joe biden is also what i call the angry
obvious guy
he likes to say obvious things that
just don't have any new new information
in them
it's just obviously what anybody would
do but if he says it
with an angry condescending
voice he sounds like a leader
um so let me give you uh give you an
example here's one of his tweets
and i'm going to read it two different
ways one is the way a normal person
would talk
all right and then i'll give you the joe
biden angry obvious guy talk
okay here's without any effects
his tweet said right now congress should
come together and pass coven relief
package like the heroes act
that the house passed six months ago
once we shut down the virus and deliver
economic
relief to workers and businesses then we
can build back better
than ever before sounds reasonable
right completely reasonable thing
democrats
want a relief bill republicans want a
relief bill
we all understand it could be important
to getting our economy going
a very reasonable tweet wouldn't you say
but if he were saying this in person he
would do an angry obvious guy voice
to make you sound more leaderly and it
would go like this
right now congress should come together
and pass a coveted
relief package like the heroes act
that the house passed six months ago
six months ago people folks six months
ago they passed
and nothing and once we shut down the
virus
and deliver economic relief
economic relief
to workers and businesses
then we can build back
better see how that
turned into literally talk just by
getting
angry and excited about ordinary words
he does that well all right
i tweeted humorously that
reading twitter lately about all the
election fraud
techniques it's like getting a prison
education
if you had asked me two weeks ago scott
can you name all the ways that an
election could be rigged
i would say well you know i haven't
thought about it but
if i make a list let's see i'll make a
list
i got uh yeah i got two or three things
that would
be ways to rig an election but i feel
like
now i have a lot of them if you ever
want to throw an election in a third
world country
and you're wondering what technique to
use
you could just ask me because i picked
up quite a bit of technique
in the the past couple weeks let me give
you a few examples
and let me say that these are techniques
which are alleged
if you ask me they all look a little
sketchy
because if it's really this easy to
cheat
then people have some real big surprises
coming
so i'd like to think that it's not
really this easy
but here are the allegations one of them
is you could take a pile of ballots
let's say for one candidate all the
votes are for one candidate
you can feed it into the counting
machine and then just
pick up the ballots and feed them
through a second time
or a third time or a fourth time now
it is alleged that that's a real thing
somebody says they saw it happen
but there's a part of me that says
really
really the system is so insecure that
you can just take the same bunch of
ballots and just feed it through a
second time
and nobody catches that now i have a
little bit of trouble believing it's
true
because it feels a little too easy but
it's alleged
how about this one dead people voting
that's probably universally true
but i doubt that dead people alone will
be some kind of a big
change to our election outcome um
here's a trick that i'd never heard of
before but it's a clever one
when unsolicited ballots are being
mailed out
they just send a whole bunch of extra
ballots to democrats
and they send republicans one so if
you're a republican
and you requested a ballot you get your
one ballot
and you think the world is good what do
you know
you requested one ballot you got one
ballot you filled it out
you're a happy republican you're a
democrat
you requested one ballot perhaps
you give five of them and you say to
yourself
huh i got five ballots
what do you do well probably most people
are honest and they go i only needed one
they throw the other four away
but some people are gonna fill out the
other ones
you don't need everybody to fill out the
extra ones you just need you know two
percent
and suddenly you've got a race now that
one is also alleged
um anecdotally we've heard some stories
about that
again i don't know how true it is it's
an allegation
i've heard the allegation that there are
lots of people register
the same addresses such that
i guess you could just say you're
different people living at one address
and you can get lots of ballots is that
a big deal
i don't know could be um
how about manually reading the ballots
wrong
so there's one allegation that uh i
guess all
the other different mechanisms and
systems for counting
votes but in one place it is alleged
that there's somebody who would have the
ballot
and would read it to the person who was
inputting and would say
uh joe biden and then the person who was
inputting would take it and was supposed
to double check it
but you know there are a lot of ballots
so they would just hear
joe biden and they would just type in
biden and just put it in a pile
without really checking that it really
said joe biden
now there's some allegation that
one of the uh the watchers saw them
uh saying that the trump ballots were
really biden
second person doesn't even look and just
inputs biden
and so i happened multiple times so
apparently
the allegation is that one way you could
cheat
is just have the person who's reading
off the votes just say biden
now is that the rock solid
voting system with checks and balances
that you thought you had
where somebody could just say oh it says
biden here yeah
trust me yeah this is biden right there
that's it
you can actually cheat that way are you
kidding me
all right here's another way i heard and
again i don't know if any of these are
real
these are just allegations um i've heard
that
uh i think this is a philadelphia story
if i remember correctly about somebody
asking whoever
was running the polling station who
should we talk to to drop off the blank
ballots
blank ballots so one way is just deliver
pallets of blank ballots
when it's time to you know put your
candidate ahead
and all right so here's another one
turning off the signature matching
so apparently there's electronic
signature matching
who knows how well that works i don't
know can you really electronically match
a signature is that even a thing
but let's say it is a thing but you
could just turn it off
you could just go to the machine go turn
it off then every
every ballot goes through when normally
lots of them would get rejected lots of
them might be
three percent as opposed to 0.03
but you could just turn it off but you
but you could also turn down the
sensitivity
because you've got a lot of work to do
you don't want to be
checking everything just because the
machine told you to so you could just
turn down the sensitivity
did you know that you could probably
dial the winner of the election just by
how sensitive
you made the signature check it could be
that easy
to throw an election just go in there
and go let's take 20
off the signature sensitivity checking
might be enough right now again i don't
know that this happened these are all
just
allegations and all the allegations are
equal
until they're not meaning that they're
all unproven until they're proven
um and then of course i haven't even
mentioned the
software system you know the dominion
systems so if you have software you have
a million different ways
somebody says there's proof that there's
no cheating because scott did not do
this in 2016.
well you know if the person you didn't
expect to get elected
gets elected uh you should check
don't you think you should check into
that so if somebody had made the same
claim
in 2016 and i don't remember it being
made
but if somebody had well i would have
taken that seriously
are you telling me that i would believe
that no
republicans had ever tried to cheat in
an election
how could you be seriously even
considering that of course
you you have to assume that both
democrats and republicans have cheated
in elections at whatever scale i don't
know
but you have to assume it's both so if
there had been those accusations in 2016
i'd probably treat them the same way i'm
treating these
which is well the allegations are just
allegations
should they be you know proven through
the
the correct mechanisms i will treat them
as facts
but if the allegation had been made in
2016
i definitely would not would not have
ruled it out
based on it being impossible on face
value
i would have done that
uh scott said about rigged in 2016 i
don't know what that comment is
there's a whole industry of people
rummaging through my old tweets and
statements to try to find an
inconsistency
it's a weird thing about being a public
figure it happened you know even this
morning
somebody produced some tweet that they
imagined was
inconsistent with something i say now
but isn't of course
all right so sidney powell as you know
super lawyer is making some really
strong allegations about this
software and it's almost so crazy that
you can't even
describe it but apparently the
allegation is that she has a
whistleblower
a high-level military person but i don't
know military of what country
she doesn't say but somehow was present
or had close personal knowledge of
this same software that we use for our
elections being originally created
for chavez in venezuela for the purpose
of throwing an election
so the allegation is that it's designed
to throw
elections it's not designed just to
count elections
that it's specifically designed to cheat
on elections
and that it was used in venezuela
effectively and other countries i think
effectively
and that now that same software which is
made
allegedly to throw elections is the one
we're using
now here's the thing
you can it's easy to believe small
allegations
isn't it if somebody says oh somebody
stole a loaf of bread
it might be true it might not be true
but it's easy to believe
it's easy to believe a person could
steal a loaf of bread
but would you say something as big as
this
that the entire election system of the
united states the greatest
uh alleged democracy in the history of
the
of civilization that our voting system
is completely fraudulent just completely
fraudulent
as in whoever has access to this feature
that changes votes is the only person
who gets to determine the election
that is such a big claim
that your brain can't process it and
that's the problem
the problem is that the claim is too big
well
you know i hate to make analogies
from uh hitler but was isn't there a gob
gobbles or gobbles or whoever it is uh
quote about
the bigger the lie the more the more
easily it can be
believed so the big lie in this case is
that the election is
that's fine it's all secure
software is not a problem who could hack
software
so that's the big lie that there's no
problem with the elections
and uh and when you hear this allegation
it too is so big
that your brain can't even process it if
if tomorrow this story went away you
would probably just stop
thinking about it you would just stop
thinking
about it as soon as the news stops
reporting it
you'll stop acting as if it were real
it's it's the weirdest psychological
thing and here's the thing i don't know
if it's real
i don't know i do know that if there's
such a thing as a piece of software
that you know various different
countries have
their fingers in it somebody at least
tried
so wouldn't you say that you could say
with 100 certainty
that various entities have certainly
tried to mess with that software
i can say that with complete confidence
because if
if the cia has never tried
to mess with that software what the hell
are they doing
why are we paying them if they're not
messing with that software
that software is used in other countries
our intelligence services probably like
every other intelligence service
is looking for ways to influence other
countries of course look at their
elections
of course so are you telling me rcia
didn't at least try to use that software
to
at least try to influence other
countries
if they didn't they all need to be fired
likewise you know the intelligence
agencies of
china and russia and great britain and
israel and everywhere else if they
haven't at least tried to get in that
software
they all need to be fired that's exactly
what you should be doing all day long
is trying to get into that in fact if
there was anything
else you were doing you should be fired
because you're not a very good spy if
you're not working full time trying to
get into that software
now my guess if i had to guess
is that that again this is just based on
knowing people
knowing motivations knowing people
knowing large organizations
knowing the job of intelligence agencies
and knowing that lots of time has gone
by so just knowing those assumptions
here's what i believe that the software
has not only been penetrated
by bad bad entities
but probably multiple
so for example there are probably more
than one employee
by now who's been placed in in these
voting system companies that are
actually just agents of foreign
companies
foreign countries wouldn't you say that
the odds that they've at least
tried to get people that they can
influence on the inside
a hundred percent they've at least tried
so by now since lots of time has gone by
almost certainly they've succeeded and i
would say the same thing about these
social
media platforms the social media
platforms by now
should be completely penetrated by all
the major intelligence agencies
or at least they've tried i would
imagine they've succeeded by now
so to me it's almost unimaginable that
the right people
haven't tried and had enough time to
make a difference
in any kind of a system so it's not an
allegation about
specifically dominion or specifically
anybody
it's just when you have that set up it
can only go one way
it's not like there are two different
ways that this goes in the long run
in the long run the intelligence
agencies of course
will take control of voting systems they
have to
it'd be crazy for them not to that is
their job
lynn wood who's also working on this
issue
working on the georgia recount he
this is a guy who does defamation
lawsuits for a living and he said this
in one of his comments and he said that
he's very careful about defaming people
in public
because it's what he does for a living
is defending people who got
defamed in public and he said still
that he's willing to say in public that
the governor of georgia is crooked
and that the election was stolen that is
pretty direct isn't it now do you think
that's true
do you think that lynnwood with all the
connections that linwood has
would know for sure whether georgia is a
corrupt
political situation do you think he'd
know now whether he could prove it or
not is the separate question
but do you think just as a person do you
think he knows
i feel like he probably does because
there probably aren't too many people
who have more access to
you know behind the scenes and how
things really work
than a high-powered you know government
kind of lawyer
so i think lynn woods probably knows
but you know i'm not going to make an
allegation because i don't want to be
sued
but he's somebody who would know and
that's a pretty direct allegation
so i think what you're gonna find and
here's the
the big red pill that the country is
getting ready to take
if i had to put money on it
and i did actually so let me correct
that i did put money on it
so i do have bets that we will
discover that the election is fraudulent
now the bet is in the form of
thinking that some of the states will be
reversed
so i've got some bets about some of the
states being reversed
which would indicate fraud all right
so here's what i think
i think that the country is going to
learn that our entire
voting system is uh
corrupted and when i say the entire
system i don't mean
oh it's just the software nope
i think we're going to find it's
literally everything
i think it's going to be soup to nuts i
think we're going to find the software
is completely corrupted
i think that we will find that the
physical ballots are completely
corrupted
and i think we'll find that the whoever
does the counting
and the way they organize the account is
completely corrupted
my guess is that it was corrupted from
top to bottom
and really corrupted and i
and i think that what this country needs
is some kind of a government in a box
for the local the local part i feel like
the country needs some kind of a
federal option where you can go to the
go to the people in the town and say all
right detroit
just picking detroit to pick on for a
moment you citizens
we're going to give you a federal
election that will not be managed
by your locals and this federal election
will ask you one question
would you like a government in a box for
two years i'll just pick a random time
if they say yes
and that so the federal government does
the election not the locals
if they say yes the federal government
comes in and for two years
they replace the entire local government
so all the
the corruption and the bribes and
everything stop
because there's nobody to bribe anymore
it's it's these federal people
government in a box and they're not
going to stay that long and then it
cleans everything up
sets up a a credible government
and then takes off after two years i
feel like
we might need it
you know i can't say that's a a
well-developed idea
so there might be some problems with
that but but it looks to me like
as long as the cities can throw the
national
elections and it looks like that's
what's happening
city government's doing that the locals
um i don't know how we can have a good
government
so we almost have to be able to have
some mechanism
to dismantle corrupt city governments
according to lou dobbs the fbi is
looking into the election but we don't
know about
that if the fbi is looking into it that
would suggest they have at least
enough evidence to look into it
newt gingrich agreed with my tweet
and as did others i asked the question
why is it that
it's not considered a hate crime when
trump supporters are attacked
for simply being trump supporters
shouldn't that be a hate crime
and i'm told that it's not a hate crime
because it's not
called out as a protected group but
apparently there's i'm not the only
person who thinks that it should be
and to me that's a no-brainer because if
you're attacking somebody for their
political opinion
a completely legal political opinion
that's a hate crime and it's a hate
crime because
the fake news gets people all worked up
to think that they're
killing nazis or something so there's
definitely hate involved
um
here's a fake news story of the type we
see all the time
it's reported by let's say the new york
times reported this
the reporting that trump asked last week
asked his senior aides what
possibilities he had for an offensive
strike
on iran's primary nuclear site now if
you see that story
you say to yourself oh wow the president
wants to
attack iran right
that's how you would interpret it if
he's asking his aides
about options for attacking iran your
brain processes
that as oh it looks like trump wants to
attack iran
but these stories are also illegitimate
because if you're the um you know if
you're at the head of the military
you should be asking this kind of
question just routinely
you should always ask what are my
options and if you're talking about iran
one of the options is always attack
if you're the if you're the
commander-in-chief of the united states
shouldn't you always be checking in to
find out what your military options are
for an active topic like iran do you
think that
do you think that the israeli military
do you think netanyahu
has never asked his military what
options they have for attacking iran
of course he has which doesn't mean he's
planning to do it next week
it just means you have to know your
options it doesn't mean anything except
checking your options
and they turn it into a story and it's a
non-story
it should be just baseline nothing
happened
checking your options is nothing
happening that's nothing
all right uh here's cnn with a little
fake news
the uh wolf blitzer was reporting that
lindsey graham
was asking the secretary of state of
georgia to toss out
legal votes
do you think that lindsey graham asked
anybody
much less the uh you know georgia
officials
do you think he asked anybody to throw
out legal
votes of course not
of course not he believes
that some votes will be determined to be
illegal
because they don't meet some requirement
of signature or whatever the details are
and that those would be illegal votes
according to the laws of the land
or at least the laws of georgia and that
georgia should follow its own law
that gets reported as lindsey graham
wants to throw out legal votes
no no that's not really what was
happening here
here was an interesting story it's a
van jones story saying that he is quoted
as saying tuesday night was devastating
the polling had been suggesting
that that there would be just a wipeout
of trump and the fact that it wasn't a
wipeout
was crushing so here's what i get from
that story so van jones thought
that the polls would be correct and that
trump would be wiped out
but why did van jones think the polls
would be correct
there's something with this story that
doesn't make sense
because um a lot of you believe
again it's just allegations but a lot of
you believe that the polling was
intentionally fraudulent
for fundraising reasons or to depress
trump votes or or something why didn't
van jones think that why is it that you
think
you thought from all last year you
thought the polls were
were fraudulent but why didn't van jones
think they were fraudulent
because based on his answer i think he
really thought they were real
why why do you think they were real
well here is my assumption he wasn't
in on the steel
so don't take this too seriously
but if you imagine that it was all
coordinated then you imagine that the
fake poles
were coordinating with the people who
faked the election
so that the polls you know somehow
they'd all be on the same team
but i don't think anybody talked i doubt
that any election fraud
was uh so widely coordinated that there
were meetings and you know
zoom conversations and stuff like that i
think just everybody knew what they
needed to do
i think that the people handling the
software
if they saw an opportunity they took it
the people had handling the ballots
if they saw an opportunity i think they
took it
i think that's all it is but so many of
them took it that
now biden's vote total is 79 million
and one of the things that uh critics
are saying
critics of trump and his supporters
they're saying that
there's no evidence that the election
was
stolen to which i say define
evidence because i would
i would acknowledge that there's no
proof
my understanding of how systems work is
that
let's say in the legal system if there's
evidence of a crime
then you start the legal process if the
prime
if that evidence does not turn into
proof
well then the person is innocent but you
don't say there's no
evidence just because you couldn't get a
conviction
there's plenty of evidence you know what
the evidence is
79 million votes that's a lot of
evidence
could it be that there's another
explanation
that it was just a really high turnout
and biden got a lot of votes because
people really didn't like trump
is that possible yeah of course
that's possible but
the evidence would suggest there's
something up
because it's pretty big coincidence or
maybe it's not a coincidence but
it would surprise a lot of people shall
we say
if that number held it would surprise a
lot of people
all right somebody says the vote count
doesn't
matter because it's uh electoral college
it does matter in this limited context
of figuring out if the vote itself was
real or fake because the total number of
people voting
that certainly would suggest there's
something going on here
especially when you compare it to the
size of biden's
rallies if you look at the strength that
people
wanted him to win he just didn't have
the energy that would suggest 79 people
79 million people showed up it just
doesn't make sense
so i would say there's plenty of
evidence
what there isn't yet is proof
but there will be so um
i think that the world is going to get a
little bit unraveled this week
because you're going to start to see the
good stuff
you know the actual uh valid
stuff that holds up and looks credible
and you're gonna see it
soon probably all this week uh so that's
really gonna change stuff
now one of the things i was worrying
about uh
when president trump brought
dr scott atlas into the uh
into the office uh and put him on the
corona task force
i thought that i would eventually be
confused with him and sure enough
i was so
i tweeted an article that calls him dr
scott adams
now i knew i just knew
that i would get confused with him
eventually
because even when president trump says
doctor
he goes scott atlas when i'm listening
to it live
and i hear i'm just listening to trump
you know while i'm doing something else
and i'll hear
trump say and i'd like to introduce
scott at and i'm like
celis oh okay that's not me
all right um hunter's laptop was hidden
from views somebody says okay i don't
know how that's relevant
29 states will be forced into a hand
recount some people say
perhaps we shall see all right
i'm going to say goodbye to periscopers
i'll talk to you tomorrow
youtubers still with me 6.9
000. wow there's a lot of you here today
um scott would trump bluff
this long if he had nothing he might he
might
uh just because he doesn't like to lose
maybe it keeps the issue alive he might
but i don't think the thing that
surprises me is watching the attorneys
i don't think you would see lynnwood or
sydney powell
or um or any of the lawyers i don't
i don't think you would see them make
such specific
uh dangerous claims unless they knew
something
uh yeah rudy giuliani you you could
maybe imagine that rudy giuliani was
you know the president's guy so maybe
you could
you could see him using a little
hyperbole but
you don't really see the other lawyers
necessarily buying into
that i i feel like i don't feel like
uh sidney powell or lindwood would throw
away their
careers making this kind of claim
unless they knew there was some meat
there slaughter meter is 97
97 um
yeah the other thing we keep learning is
how many interconnections there are
how many people are connected to one
thing and also connected to another
thing and connected to voting
it's uh pretty scary
um somebody says i feel like catherine
says i feel like china is involved
well again why wouldn't they be why
wouldn't they be they can send us
a fentanyl by the boatloads and
coronavirus and
bad trade deals and steal our ip and
nothing happens
why would they why would they not try to
ruin our election
it wouldn't make sense for them to try
what is the slaughter meter so the
slaughter meter is a is a
momentary uh it's a slice of time
that says how the election will go and
at 100
it would say that trump is 100 going to
be re-elected
now i think the slaughter meter has to
be revised
i think that we will learn the election
was stolen that's my prediction
i think we will learn the election was
stolen but
the mainstream media has the power
to make that disappear and i think
that's the way it's going to go
so i think that we will know that the
election was stolen historians may
record it that way but that joe biden
will probably take the office
because the the mainstream media will
just say
oh yeah he won and it just doesn't
matter if it's not true
they'll just say you did and then you'll
take the office
all right
um what would happen if trump retook
the white house in terms of riots well
there would be great civil unrest
and so one of the plays that trump has
available to him
is to win the election and then resign
uh resign put pence in charge have pence
pardon him for everything and then start
a media platform
and and really have some power
i got to tell you it's a lot more fun
criticizing things than it is defending
things
so um
yeah if if biden takes office uh you
also
would be heading toward uh republican
control of congress
fairly soon what about the phone calls
i don't know uh any news on phone calls
alright that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
