hey everybody
come on in it's time it's time for
coffee with scott adams the best time of
the day every single time
and i'll tell you it was tough it was
tough getting here i didn't have
internet all yesterday i'll tell you
about that
but first wouldn't you like to ramp up
your day a little bit better
have a great time in the next 45 minutes
or so
yeah you would and all you need is a
copper mug or glass a
tankered chalice or steiner canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous step it happens now go
oh that's so good
have you ever noticed that sometimes
your beverage tastes
extra good and you don't know why well
it's one of those days
yes yesterday my neighborhood was
internet free
and i don't remember the last time i
went a full
day without internet now i still had my
phone uh you know data plan but for
reasons that i don't understand
it stopped working at the same time now
i don't know why the jackhammer
that turned off the wi-fi in my
neighborhood meaning
the cable cable got caught i guess
but why that affected data flying
through the air
and the only day it didn't work was the
same day that my regular internet went
out
it was just sort of weird anyway
christina and i looked at each other and
said what are we going to do without the
internet
and i had to go back to my little house
in the prairie days thinking saying
what did people do
what would you do without the internet
if the only thing you had
was a beautiful woman
but what are you going to do well
it turns out that christine is a better
problem solver than i am so we we
figured out how to fill that time and i
got to say it was pretty good
it was pretty good i didn't have access
to twitter so much but
we worked it out so if you're worried
what will happen to us if we don't have
the internet for a few hours
there are other options i was surprised
too
i didn't know it so speaking on that uh
same topic and by the way the the the
most
upsetting thing about not having
internet
and i don't know if you've experienced
this yet maybe some of you have
my house is what i call a a living house
meaning that from any room in my house
including the garage
i can talk to my house and make an
answer and do things
that's because i have a you know digital
assistant amazon's product
throughout my house so in all the key
rooms anyway there's a
there's a alexa you know one of the uh
digital devices so all day long i'm
walking through my house and they'll say
you know hey what's the weather what
time is it
uh you know answer this question
i i make you do math because i'll be
thinking i wonder
i wonder if the math of that world works
and i just speak out loud
and it does the math for me and then i
go on it's almost
it's become this uh augmentation to my
normal
experience that i just expect the house
to talk to me
because i don't really look at the
device when i'm talking to it
because it's you know all over the house
so i just talk
and it answers and when that goes off
your house is dead now if you've never
experienced a living house
you wouldn't notice one is dead but it's
really weird
to have a house that won't talk back to
you for the first time in
a few years all right
i was looking at uh greg jarrett's
uh blog i guess it would be called
website
and he's decided that the
in the chauvin trial that the
prosecution has made its case
and made it clearly and unambiguously
and he says
basically he says quote no reasonable
jury could conclude
that chauvin did not substantially cause
floyd's death
i guess the phrase substantially caused
is the wrong one substantially caused
because i
that's sort of up for a lot of
interpretation isn't it
i i feel like there's something wrong
with sending somebody to jail
over a phrase as ambiguous as
substantially caused
because there's still a lot of other
things you'd have to know right
as in would the person not have died
except for these other causes you know
was the substantial part the person
the part that killed them did they know
were they aware of it you know there's a
lot of questions there
but according to greg jarrett who is an
attorney
um so looking at it with through his
attorney eyes
he says the case is made basically and
even thinks the second degree murder is
a high possibility
now early on when i was looking at this
i just said all right he's way
overcharged
second degree murder having some
intention to do it there's no way that
got proven
and indeed i didn't see that but i
didn't watch all the trial
how many of you who are let's say not
attorneys
so you're looking at the trial stuff
maybe you're only seeing clips that came
out
but how many of you who are not
attorneys would agree with greg jarrett
that the case is totally made
even up to the point of good chance of
second degree murder
how many of you would agree with that
based on what you've seen
because my real question is can he
if you're an attorney and you really
know how things are supposed to work
does that blind you to how non-attorneys
would think
or does he have so much experience that
he can see both
which you would expect
yeah a lot of you are disagreeing so i
think it doesn't matter what a
well-trained
highly let's say highly capable observer
would think
because that's not who's on the jury so
i'll tell you that my view on it did
did evolve so on day one based on what
the public knew
i said i don't see any of the way he's
going to get convicted
day one the prosecution i will say did a
good job
i'm going to say that their experts were
good for the prosecution and i thought
the defense
was very capable but if i had to guess
he's going to get convicted of something
i would think that the odds of him not
getting convicted of
anything are really really small
but the odds of you know i thought it
would be manslaughter
but i'm i am a little bit influenced by
greg jarrett's opinion just because he
knows what he's talking about and i
don't
so um so keep an eye on that
um here are some of the things that greg
says he says the officer's excessive use
of force was deliberate
was it do you think that the officer's
excessive use of force was deliberate
because that wouldn't
assume that the officer knew what he was
doing in terms of
what his impact would be because i feel
like
that's the opposite of proven it seems
to me that as obvious he didn't know
because why would you do it right in
front of witnesses now we haven't heard
the defense's
closing arguments but i know how this
sounds but i'm going to say it anyway
all right you know that i'm trained in
persuasion right so this isn't stupid
what i'm going to say i feel like i
could get him off
i feel like there's enough there that
with
the world's greatest i'm not saying i
would be the world's greatest but
but a really strong defense
wrap up summary i feel like it could
it could make the difference because i
think everybody agrees at this point
that the facts
aren't going to matter to the to the
conclusion right
the jury is going to think how do i
protect myself
you know can i possibly let this guy off
and go on and live with my life i'll be
attacked and killed
so that's part of it that has nothing to
do with the facts
of the case and
i think that there's enough ambiguity
here that you could
pretty much make the case here's how i
would argue it
i would say you're wondering if the
officer knew what he was doing
so this would be the yeah the second
degree charge
second degree murder if you think that
he knew what he was doing
how would you explain the fact that he
did it slowly
in front of witnesses who were filming
it and in front of his peers
how could that possibly be explained by
him knowing he was using too much force
why would he do that what possible
motivation
would anybody have to ruin their own
life quite clearly
by committing a crime in front of the
best witnesses in the world
if you're the jury and you hear me say
that what's your answer
he's a racist that doesn't make sense
because even a racist wants to protect
themselves you know even a racist wants
to protect
their own family so everything that you
saw
chauvin do made no sense
if you thought he knew what he was doing
it didn't make any sense
if you put me in front of the jury i'm
going to demolish that
and what we've seen from the defense
attorney is that he's capable of doing
that as well
so until you hear the closing argument
i don't know if you've heard anything
then the um then uh greg says greg
jarrett says
at the very least the defendant
committed a dangerous act
in using the legal term quote evincing a
depraved mind
okay evincing a depraved mind
you're on the jury and you're not a
lawyer
what the hell does that mean
do you think that the average jury of
americans
could even wrestle with the concept
you know competently all 12 of them some
of them of course
but any 12 americans that you pick you
know
not based on their let's say academic
credentials
but just a cross-section of americans on
a jury
how many of them could competently deal
with
what evincing a depraved mind
even means now of course it'll be
defined for them etc
but do you think that'll help 12
americans
you think all 12 of them are going to
get what evincing a deprived
depraved mind actually even means
no we don't live in a country where 12
people could
handle that 12 people couldn't even
handle
directions on you know putting ikea
furniture together
you can't get 12 people to do anything
competently like all of them
so that's a problem and i would say that
put me in front of the jury and i would
say ladies and gentlemen of the jury
the charge of third degree murder
depends well i guess this one also would
cover manslaughter
but it depends on you understanding the
the thoughts of mr chauvin
do you think he can do that do you think
you can
without reasonable doubt know what
officer chauvin was thinking now most of
those jurors will be thinking to
themselves yes i can
i just watched all the evidence i saw
the video too many times
i absolutely can figure out what he was
thinking
and then i say to the jury ladies and
gentlemen the jury
have you ever been married have you ever
had a partner or spouse boyfriend or
girlfriend
everybody of course will say yes
at least in their mind they'll say yes
have you ever had a situation in which
you were misunderstood by your partner
and that they were sure they could read
your mind
but they were completely wrong does that
happen to any of you
and do you think that the certainty of
your spouse
about what you're thinking was their
certainty in any way
related to the accuracy of what they
thought about your thoughts
have you noticed that people don't know
what you're thinking
have you noticed how often you've been
wrong when you were positive
you knew what somebody was thinking
let's say your spouse
only to find out that you're completely
wrong
ladies and gentlemen if this case
depends on you knowing the thoughts of a
stranger
no matter how much data was presented
you are not being reasonable
a reasonable person knows they cannot
know the inner thoughts of another
person
you can only watch what they did and
even then
the video can be misleading so at best
you have misleading video you have
conflicting testimony and you would have
to rely
on what is effectively magic the belief
that you can read a stranger's mind
you don't think that's reasonable doubt
honestly i could win this case i think i
feel i could
like you know i'm sure that lawyers are
laughing at me right now
because you know lawyers are so
they're gonna laugh at anybody who
anybody who thinks they can do their job
better than that uh
no i'm just kidding lawyers are
wonderful people
actually most lawyers are wonderful
people but
it was funnier when i said it that way
and somebody says we're all laughing at
you
thank you have i mentioned what that
shamelessness is a superpower
you know one of the things that makes
you watch anything is that there's some
danger or there's some provocation
there's something different something
something out of the
the usual and when you see me do
something that makes you say
there you go i feel he's being arrogant
or i feel like he's go he's way out over
his skis
man lawyers are going to rip this guy
apart that's why you watch
do you think it's an accident that i go
to the edge
no the edge is the only the only thing
that's worth doing
if i didn't do that you wouldn't watch
so you're supposed to be a little bit
uncomfortable
now in my segment uh the left eats
itself
cbs apparently is doing some major
reorganization
uh because they're uh they're racist and
misogynist
so cbs apparently is full of racist and
misogynist and they had to do something
about it
okay and it's probably true by the way
i'm certainly not doubting it
but the the people on the left
are uh getting a good dose of their own
medicine
and i'm not saying that this isn't fully
warranted i'm sure these complaints have
some basis in fact but uh it's
interesting to watch
everything come home isn't it now let's
talk about the trump curse
you know the trump curse which is people
who
criticize uh ex-president trump
bad things happen to them or thing or
people he doesn't like
well today we hear that mike pence got a
pacemaker
which um you know these days is a
fairly safe procedure right
but if you had somebody running for
president let's say hypothetically
would you be comfortable if that person
had a pacemaker
now of course the medical professionals
will probably come out and say this is
so routine now
well you probably probably everybody
knows somebody who's got a pacemaker
right
and you can live live forever and you
know it works fine
but how does it feel to the voters the
voters are going to feel
like it's just a little something to
worry about right
so that's bad news for mike pence who
and like i've said i've always been a
fan of
mike pence as a good person who has some
really
um in my opinion objectionable opinions
about the lgbtq community but i think
he's evolving
um and then uh
i just noticed this robert de niro
apparently he's just getting uh
absolutely killed in his divorce
his estranged wife is asking for all of
his money he's complaining that he has
to take any acting job at age
77 just to just to pay for her
extravagant
extravagant spending but here was
here was the headline i think this was
in fox news on their website
uh the headline for this story was aging
bull
[Music]
aging bull because you know part of the
story is that
at age 77 he has to keep taking jobs
so whoever came up with that headline
aging bull
good job
and what this makes me wonder is uh if i
could hire
uh robert de niro because apparently the
story is he'll he has to take any job
that's offered
because he just needs money desperately
so he you know he wouldn't want to be
working necessarily
on marginal jobs at age 77
but i'm wondering if i could hire him
like just to do something i don't know
to make a
make a commercial maybe i'll hire him to
make a like a dilbert
commercial or something just for fun
all right uh as i've told you bill maher
has i believe elevated to a new level of
relevance he was always relevant he's
always quoted almost
every time he does a show he becomes the
news the next day and that's about as
relevant as you can get
but i feel like he's ascended to a new
height
and for reference you know i've i've
been critical of his opinions
in the past especially on trump's stuff
but
he has become the best insider uh critic
of the left insider meaning he you know
has more affinity for that side but man
he's being savage
to his own team and right
like you could be savage if you're right
and he's just right
and here's some of the things he's been
saying about that
so so bill maher pointed to a gallup
survey
that showed that a vast majority of
democrats
incorrectly overestimate the probability
of being hospitalized from covid
with 41 percent of democrats believing
there's a 50 percent chance
there's a 50 percent chance of
hospitalization if you get covert
democrats believe there's a 50 chance
you'll end up in the hospital
if you get covered what news do you
think they've been consuming
now apparently they're even let's see
compare that to two while only 10 of
democrats correctly said
that the probability is only one in five
or one to five percent
i'm sorry uh one to five percent while
26 percent of republicans
said said the same
so basically maher is saying that the
democrats are completely
factually uninformed and that the party
of science he basically mocks his own
party
for being the party of science and being
completely oblivious to science
now he has to know what the problem is
right
he has to know that the problem is the
news
right cnn msnbc the news of course he
knows that
of course he does and um
and he goes on i mean this is sort of
like this was his closing monologue and
the parts i'm reading about are
basically a masterpiece of
political commentary in my opinion he
goes
i think a lot of people died because of
trump's incompetence
you can agree or disagree with that
opinion but i would they say that's
you know a reasonable mainstream opinion
right
and he goes and i think a lot of people
died because of talking
because talking about obesity became a
third rail in america
it is a key piece of the puzzle by far
the most pertinent factor
but you dare not speak its name
who else on the left could say that
right and again i'm not even sure bill
maher even qualifies as
just being on the left because he's one
of the few people who can take a
reasonable opinion
no matter where it lands um
that's pretty brave it's pretty brave
right and this is why we like having a
bill maher in the world
because he can just say stuff or he's
willing to that you can't say
and i think that's important for his
audience to hear
then bill moore blasted the atlantic
magazine
do you remember when the atlantic well
i'm not sure i ever remember
was sort of respectable and then it
became just sort of a joke
joke of the magazine which it is now uh
so he made fun of the atlantic for
shaming the media's use of beach photos
as a concern for spreading the virus and
then
mars said even though it's increasingly
looking like the beach is the best place
to avoid it
so again atlantic associated with the
left
completely unscientifically covering you
know the beaches as being a problem
and then bill maher went on to praise
ron desantis for following the science
and he described ron desantis a
republican
bill maher on his show highly
let's say highly favored by people on
the left
said out loud without a qualifier
this is important can you imagine
somebody somebody's voice who's as
prominent
on the left giving an unqualified
opinion that ron desantis nailed this
thing
when was the last time you heard a
democrat
not throw in uh and he's bad on these
other things
right that's just the common thing well
i don't like
ron desantis for x y and z but i gotta
say he might have done okay with it
that would be the normal way you'd hear
this
credit to bill maher he didn't do that
he just talked about the thing that was
the topic
and accurately described it in my
opinion he also gave desantis credit for
i think he used the phrase voraciously
consuming
the scientific literature and then he
mocked
you know he mocked the democrats for for
pretending
that they're the the party of science he
basically just ripped off
you know the whole illusion that the
democrats have some kind of monopoly on
science
because clearly it's not the case now he
did say that
you know that covid was the democrats uh
equivalent of
you know climate science denial which by
the way
i'm closer to his opinion than you might
you might know
uh closer to bill maher's opinion that
you know something has to be done
but i'm a little less panicked than the
average person
all right um somebody says are you
angling to be a guest on his show well i
was a guest on the show
so i have been a guest on the show i'm
not doing media
at the moment so i'm not angling to be
on anything
because if i were asked i wouldn't do it
only because i'm not doing any media at
the moment
yes and and bill maher pointed out that
protecting the nursing homes was
probably because desantis understood the
science better
so speaking of desantis
whose uh i guess his uh reputation is
rising among republicans etc
and oh come on come on come on
pk pk i can't let that go i can't let
that comment go
bill maher is a narcissist you got to do
better than that
right you got to do better than that
you know my view is anybody who calls
somebody a narcissist
all you're saying is that you have low
self-esteem
that's all i hear okay pk you have low
self-esteem
and you don't want to hear anybody
talking confidently about anything
you're you're arrogant um
that's the lowest level of analysis is
this person's a narcissist
all right so um
ron desantis so cnn did a big opinion
piece on ron desantis
and what do you think cnn said about all
of the flaws of
ron desantis because you know cnn used
to be a news organization when i was a
kid
but at this point i don't think anybody
thinks of it as a news organization at
least nobody
nobody is paying attention you know
they've morphed into a
pure propaganda operation as project
veritas has now
shown us with no doubt
well thank you omg puppies
you're too nice um
but here's what's interesting about
cnn's treatment of ron desantis
are you ready for this
no criticisms this actually happened
today
there's a an opinion piece it's not even
news it's an opinion piece
it's on cnn it's about a republican
no criticism it just said he's doing
great his popularity is rising
what what
what so
what's this mean now i know you're
thinking you're saying well that means
he really has a good chance of being
president et cetera
well maybe
or cnn is just telling you
telling the world who needs to be taken
down
it could be the cnn because we know that
they've done this
with trump and ted cruz yeah there are
documents that have been
presented this show without any doubt
the democrats and cnn were working
together to try to promote the wrong
candidates
for the republicans so that trump would
get nominated and he couldn't possibly
win the presidency
whoops whoops so it could be
and i'm not i'm not i'm not saying this
is the case
but the thing you'd have to worry about
is that cnn
wants him to be the nominee because they
may think
he's weak in some way which i don't know
now one way that you can make the
argument is he's not exciting
so wouldn't you agree ron desantis does
not
light up the room with his charisma and
if he were running
in a you know let's say against trump
he just wouldn't have a chance because
trump's charisma just you know fills the
room and
makes everybody disappear but what if
trump doesn't run and i i don't he says
he is i don't know
maybe maybe not what if he doesn't run
suddenly there's nobody interesting in
the race right and then that whole
charisma thing
just matters less there just wouldn't be
anybody interesting there'd be some
governors
there's nobody interesting if you put
ron
desantis into a group of uh competitors
where nobody's interesting the way trump
is interesting
i don't know that he could lose i don't
know that he could lose
because unless something new comes up
with the way he handled kovid
he's the next president and by the way
earned it earned it right if that
happens
i would say he earned it
um let me ask you this and this is
pretty revealing
name the biggest negative uh in terms of
political let's say mistakes or
reputation
or brand ron desantis name his biggest
flaw
go like a real flaw you know not
you don't like his haircut or something
name ron desantis
biggest flaw
that watch to watch the somebody says
boring but remember that only matters
if there's somebody interesting in the
race and trump's the only interesting
people person we've seen in a long time
somebody says short white his voice
[Music]
yeah white republican look at the
comments
there's nothing there have you ever
thought to yourself what would happen if
somebody ran for president and had
trump's
policy preferences without the
provocation that might be ron desantis
he i i think he maps pretty close to a
trump kind of view of politics but
without the provocation
i don't know has anybody even called him
a racist like the most common thing that
you would call a republican
somebody says he's friends with matt
gates
i don't know at this point um
he surprised me a little bit but if he
runs against anybody interesting he has
a problem
all right but at the moment i have a
high opinion of him so we'll see what
happens
um speaking of brave uh
brave pundits you know there are only a
few people
in the uh in the public eye
who are even able to say what they think
one of them was bill maher another is uh
greg gutfeld
who had a real good a great monologue
about uh
i guess ben and jerry's want to defund
the police and stuff
and uh greg guffeld went after him
ben jerry's for basically creating one
of the foods that makes you fat
and makes you die of covet and
again there are only a few people in the
world
who would call out that obesity is being
ignored essentially um as
as big a you know issue as it is
but uh greg took that on and uh you
should read that
set um
he he said in part uh it's not hard to
see that a product that packs more fat
than
chris christie's swim trunks isn't doing
black americans any favors
all right so if you haven't if you
haven't checked out uh guffeld's new
show
in the evening spot it's eight o'clock
on the west coast and
11 p.m at uh the east coast you should
check that out
speaking of check out i was at safeway
yesterday in the self checkout
have you ever used the self checkout uh
of course you have have you ever
successfully used
self checkout without somebody having to
come over and clear it for you
i have not so i have this uh
you know many year track record and i do
it just for fun to see if i can do it
let's see if i can use the self checkout
without having to call the attendant
over to clear something and fix
something
and change the number of bags never
works
so yesterday again it didn't work and
the
the helper who helps out when you we
need it
comes over and let me preface this by
saying i don't do fat shaming
fat shaming is not allowed on this
everybody's different
nobody wants to be overweight right so
nobody nobody chooses it
we're all different there are reasons
that people have more weight than other
people
um but the woman who came over was very
large
very large woman and i have to tell you
that
i i gave her a lot of distance
because if the science is right the
the people who are most likely to have a
bad infection which would make you a
super spreader
are going to have certain
characteristics and she had them
and so i gave her a lot of distance and
i wondered if we'd known that earlier if
it made
any difference i feel like it would do
you know there's a gigantic
problem in this country that nobody
talks about because it's one of those
it's hard to talk about but we're saying
a few more articles about it
it's a loneliness loneliness
it's a really unsexy topic
and it's also one that you're not likely
to find a leader
who turns it into you know movement or
something
because if you were a leader who could
turn something into a movement
you would be not lonely
so lonely people are sort of the least
able to
complain right or at least complain
productively
you just complain to your friends
so here's a statistic in 2018 nearly
half of americans reported sometimes
they're always feeling alone
recent findings suggest that during the
pandemic
over one in three americans face serious
loneliness i think this was in
cnn also think of that
one in three facing what they call
serious
loneliness yeah and if you think
loneliness doesn't kill people you're
really wrong
i think loneliness kills probably as
many people as
as a lot of diseases yeah and the
lockdowns of course making everything
worse
um but i want but there's
something even worse coming
remote work if you're
naturally let's say you're just not
socially
adept you're just not good at it
at least you could go to work and you
would be forced to interact with people
who were forced to interact with you
so if you were not the kind of person
who could create a social life at least
you
could be have one inflicted on you what
happens when all your co-workers say hey
let's work remotely
and then you have to work remotely too
because you've all agreed
that's devastating there must be a lot
of remote workers who
are just desperate to get back to an
office
just so they're humans just have human
contact
i can tell you that when i work i first
moved to california in my early 20s and
i had a job at a bank
and i didn't know anybody literally
i just didn't know anybody you know i
finally met one person who played
tennis with and that was about it and
the
the loneliness was really tough
really tough and on friday evening i
would come home
and i wouldn't see well i would see but
i wouldn't talk to or have any
interaction with and certainly not
physically touch anybody
for two days and by the time monday
morning came
i was like so desperate for human
contact that going to work
felt like going on vacation that's not
even
i'm not exaggerating a bit i was
desperate to go back to work
because it was the only place i could
talk to another human i didn't have any
human contact
and you know especially in those days i
was a little less
socially adept i probably could solve it
now but there's another thing that's
making things pretty bad
it's a thing called tinder have you
heard of it
the problem with tinder as is well
documented
is that women of course can you know
have their pick of men
so on tinder they just pick the top ten
percent of good-looking men and they
just ignore everybody else
so if you're male and you're not in that
top 10 percent that always gets picked
on tinder
you don't even have the chance to sort
of accidentally talk somebody into
liking you
you don't even get past the swipe
and you know i've never i have never
been single in a
tinder world uh or at least i've never
used
tinder and been single at the same time
but
uh this is devastating this is
really really devastating and i think
it's going to be worse for men
what happens when there's a problem that
is way worse for men
nobody cares am i right
if if you could imagine that women
are better at just you know making
friends and socializing and stuff and i
think that's a fair statement
that there'll be plenty of loneliness on
the women's side too
but it's sort of a man problem isn't it
like it feels like it's 80 male problem
and you know what we care about male
problems nothing
nothing society doesn't care about men's
problems
never has never will not not this kind
of problem
they might they might care about like
gun violence and stuff like that where
it's you know big and flashy and
somebody's dying but if somebody is just
silently
silently dying of loneliness literally
society doesn't care so
i see this is one of the biggest worst
problems that's coming toward us is
already here
for a lot of people and i got to tell
you
i've told you before that
i didn't realize i'd never felt fear
before
until i felt it you know a year ago i
didn't realize i'd gone through life
without feeling fear i just didn't even
know what it felt like so i didn't miss
it
so i didn't know i didn't have it but
there is one thing that scares the
out of me
it is loneliness it's the only thing
that really scares me i mean i was
scared about
christina learning to fly airplanes that
scared
me but uh loneliness
scares me a lot a lot
all right uh in cuba raul castro's
stepping down
i think you'll still have effective
power but other people will
be a name running cuba and
i heard i heard the saddest here
let's know how sad this is cuba
apparently
tried to make their own vaccine
now i don't think they've completed it i
think they're still working on it
i don't know maybe they could do it but
there's something terribly terribly
wrong
if little cuba has to go on their own
and i get i get it they brought it on
themselves they at least the leadership
did not the people
but that's just terrible
how bad is it that there's this you know
little island right off the united
states
which is at least strategically
important and they had to make their own
vaccine
really nobody nobody can help out cuba
that doesn't feel right because we're
mad at their
you know if anything we're mad at their
leadership we're not mad at their people
this is just so wrong and i don't know
if maybe the leadership is entirely a
fault i don't know
but it seems to me that this uh change
of leadership in cuba
would and especially with the
coronavirus stuff going on it feels like
this would be the time
to just offer a deal now i need a fact
check on this can
somebody give me a fact check i have not
heard in the news that cuba has a closed
internet do they if you're in cuba
can you and you can get to the internet
at all
can you get to the whole internet can
somebody tell me
because we hear about you know iran and
china and stuff
but i haven't heard about cuba and the
internet
all right because what i'd like to know
is how in the world
will we remain enemies if whatever we
are
with cuba if they have the internet
somebody says i doubt it
they have tor uh
their somebody says they're very capable
internet look it up
that's what you're for you're supposed
to tell me in the comments all right
um but it seems to me that this would be
exactly the time to make a
an opening offer to cuba something along
the lines of
hey if you if we can play nice with each
other
you can all get richer but we'll even
open up
private investment in cuba where you
will let people build hotels down there
you can have everything you want and we
won't even be your enemy
just work with us right just work with
us
now i feel like this is the time to do
it
because if they do have access to the
internet and certainly they would have a
workaround if they don't
um the public is going to see the united
states offering
offering all these things and how does
the leadership deny it
i don't know if i feel like this is the
time so let's do it
um cnn of course is also targeting you
know anybody who has a strong voice
on the right and nicole hemmer
did an opinion piece on tucker carlson
and
watching the you know what used to be a
respected news organization
turned into a propaganda outfit is
really interesting
if you have the same interest i do of
persuasion
and they're going after tucker for using
the word replacement
or replacing now the history of that is
that there's something called the
the great replacement which i guess is
some white supremacist or
racist view that
the brown people are coming in and
replacing the people in this united
states
so that would be the racist version and
there and cnn is
and others are trying to tie tucker
to the the white supremacist you know
great replacement idea
because he used the word replacing or
replaced
now my job is to help you sort
news from propaganda let's dig into this
a little bit
what is what is a fact and what is just
propaganda
now tucker does use
the word replacement uh but he uses it
in the sort of english language sense
not in the greater great replacement
sense
but but here's where the critics come in
and say
is that just the english language sense
or is this a
or is this a wink and a whistle to the
racists
well here's the problem tucker has a
really unique
place in the world in which he refuses
to use other people's language
so if other people want to say he's dog
whistling
and he just wants to use a word he's
going to use the damn word
and he's going to let the chips fall
where they do where they will
now whether you think it's a good idea
for him to do it or a bad idea
if it were me i would avoid the word
because to me it would just be a
distraction and i it wouldn't wouldn't
let me get my message across
so i don't want to create distractions
in my communication so i wouldn't use it
it would just be giving you a new thing
to be mad at me for
but as i've often said i i have a great
appreciation for people that
do different things than i do because
you need creative tension
in this world and tucker is probably the
strongest voice right now
maybe in the united states strongest
voice for
declaring his personal freedom in
in a sense declaring it for all of us
simultaneously
and his personal freedom yet lets him
use the words he wants to use because
they're english words and he's talking
and if he wants to if he wants to die on
the hill he won't die on it but
if he wants to make that stand for the
rest of us
which is yes i can use any words i want
and i'm not going to let you define them
i like that so even though i would have
played it differently
i definitely appreciate that there's
somebody out there who has that strong
voice who's willing to say yeah you can
kill me
before you can make me talk with your
words
he's basically saying that i mean
because he isn't a dangerous
literally it's a physically dangerous
position right i don't have to say more
it is physically dangerous for him to
take that position
and he's taken the position that freedom
is more valuable than life
you need him like he's a requirement for
this country
you could disagree with everything he
says
but you need one of him you need more of
him right
the the people who say all right here's
my limit
my limit is you can't tell me how what
words to use
i'll die on that hill good for him
good for him now but let's dig in a
little bit and see what we think about
his choice words and
you know how that feels now of course
the cnn and the others will try to
paint this as the great replacement but
let me ask you this
imagine if you will a conversation with
a
black american
i don't have to say more whether it's
democrat or republican just uh
oh let's make it a democrat we'll make
it interesting so imagine if you will
you're having a conversation with a
black american
and you say um your current situation
as a citizen of the united states is
that the country has a certain amount of
resources
that is available for the citizens so
each person
in the united states is getting some
share maybe not even but
some share of the united states's
resources
and you're getting some of that right
right um also each individual citizen
has some political power
based on their vote and you have that
right of course and you say
what would you think of letting people
from outside the country
into the country so they could take some
of the resources that
you know would have been yours and some
of the political power
that would have been yours what do you
think of that average
black democrat american what would they
say
well i think if they were good democrats
they'd say i'm good with that
this is a country of immigrants of
course we want to help them
you know our our economic well-being in
the future
actually requires immigration
we don't even have an option if you
stopped immigration
we would eventually you know age out and
be unproductive
and it would be bad for everything so
yes i'm totally on board
with immigration coming in even though i
completely understand
it reduces a little bit of the resources
in the short run
in the long run i think it might be good
but in the short run it reduces my
resources
and it reduces my political power if
they vote because there'll be
more of them you know and i'm still just
one person
and then you say you know that's that's
very open-minded of you and
and i agree with you more than i
disagree we do need immigration to be
economically healthy by the way you all
know that right
is there anybody here who doesn't know
that at least with among
economists left or right if we don't
have a lot of
young people coming in with immigration
we're kind to dead
does everybody know that or do you think
that just immigration is bad
you have is required it's not even
optional really
is the way we're set up it's it's closer
to required
and when i say required i mean for the
strongest economy
all right so now you continue your
conversation with my hypothetical
imaginary black democrat american
you say all right i'm on the same side
with you we do need immigration
and even if it costs a little bit even
if it decreases a little bit of your
vote
you get more than you lose and then i
say
well that wasn't exactly what i was
talking about what i'm talking about
is that you let everybody in if they
want to come in
they can come in and then the black
democrat says
well how many people would that be
compared to our normal
amount which is kind of healthy well it
would be unlimited it would be waves and
waves of people
and it would be up to them how much of
your resources
they get and then he say wait a minute
say that again
yeah that's right it wouldn't be up to
you
how much of america's resources which
are part yours
it wouldn't be up to you how much of
that got transferred to them
it would be up to them because they're
the ones deciding to come
if lots of them decide to come then a
lot of your resources go that way
but it's their decision now what do you
think
do you think that there's even one black
democrat that you could get to say yeah
i still like it
even though i'll be worse off
i mean you could probably get somebody
to say anything you know there's always
25
of the public that will say anything but
seriously
are there any black americans who
disagree
with tucker no
i don't think there are you would just
have to present the argument
without all the trigger words if you
take the triggers out
and you acknowledge that immigration of
course is good for the country
it's i don't think anybody who's smart
even argues that
i might be wrong but is there anybody
smart
on either the left or the right who
thinks immigration could just stop
there's nobody smart who believes that
right everybody believes there has to be
some level
it's just a difference in what it is
whether it's unlimited or limited
so when tucker uses the word replacement
he is using it in the
english language sense if you hear a
dog whistle good for you it's english
he can use english he's allowed
replacement's a word and it is quite
literally
an accurate description meaning that
your amount of political power would be
some of it not not you but some of that
would be replaced
with a little more power for other
people some of the resources that would
be
partly yours as an american some of that
would be
replaced with other people getting it
not even saying this bad again if
immigration is the right level
for good economics and good health of
the country then that's exactly the
replacement you'd want
right no matter who you are
you want the country to be prosperous et
cetera
all right so a lot of this is a fake
argument and you can see the news has
turned into propaganda
it's the only way you can put us against
each other if immigration were ever
described without
the trigger words i don't even think
we'd have any disagreement
in many ways immigration is largely just
a fake issue
it's a fake issue because if i put you
in
if i put a bunch of democrats in the
room who just let's say they disagreed
with me on
on immigration i'll bet you
we would leave the room agreeing i'll
bet you
no matter how we entered the room about
we'd leave the room agreeing if you let
the rest of the world
be ignored and it was just people in a
room talking because i would say the
same thing i did
everybody agrees some immigration is
good raise your hands everybody
everybody agrees that unlimited
immigration would be bad right
and if anybody says no i think unlimited
immigration is good then you just say
you're not for us you you need to
you need to go somewhere where you're
not trying to be a country
right you know some place where they
don't mind that your country falls apart
and then i would say how about this
we'll get our best economic
economist to agree how much immigration
and what kind and
from what people from where for the best
economic result
would you be okay with that yet just the
economists decide
if if they say more immigration is good
for the people who are already here
we do it if the economists say more
immigration is bad
for the people who are already here we
do less of it
do you disagree or agree i think you can
get most democrats to walk out of the
room in complete agreement
you know if you could if you could strip
the politics out which is hard
um so biden continues to become trump
but it didn't work out this time
i i told you in advance that biden would
be forced
to adopt a lot of trump's policies that
he had
complained about but one of them one of
the ones he tried to adopt
was reduce or keeping the same level as
trump had
for refugees
so as opposed to regular immigrants
refugees
and apparently that limit's pretty low
15 000 or something
biden wanted to be 60 some thousand but
he
he started by saying he had to keep it
the same and of course aoc
and everybody attacked him on the left
and now he's rethinking it
so he has to rethink it now but isn't it
interesting
that when joe biden the leader of the
left
had to make the actual decision you know
it wasn't just talk anymore now he's in
charge he has to actually do it
that he agreed with trump
when he had to actually make the
decision he violated his own promise
and just did what trump did because once
you looked at the facts
i guess that's where they both ended up
um
but apparently now he got so much
pushback he's gonna have to do something
he
obviously didn't want to do uh jen saki
quite cleverly blamed this on trump
before i tell you how if you haven't
heard this part
take a guess i want to see if you can
guess how did uh
biden's spokesperson jensaki how did she
find a way to blame
trump for the fact that biden wasn't
going to increase the number of refugees
over trump's level
let's see if you could guess the this
will see if you could be the
spokesperson somebody says racism uh
no not in this case
it's hard isn't it yeah kovid no
no those are good guesses but no all
right here's the answer
uh jen saki says that the trump
administration
dismantled the refugee um
system in other words there are people
in the government who are in charge of
bringing in the refugees
and apparently trump had dismantled it
so it so
so biden didn't have a choice he only
could bring in some refugees because
they didn't have enough
infrastructure to bring in more does
that sound
true it might be
but i don't think so i mean if i had to
put bet on it
i would bet there's no truth to that
whatsoever or
if there's a little bit of truth to it
it's not really the obstacle that
they're presenting to it
yeah she actually used somebody saying
she used the word trashed
he trashed the system i wonder if you
looked into it you would find that he
had
trashed the system all right here's an
interesting thing happened i've told you
before that the phrase
black lives matter is is brilliant
persuasion
and you know why because if anybody
tries to push back on it
it sounds like you're saying black lives
don't matter and there's no way you're
going to get away with that
right so it was sort of this bulletproof
thing and
you we saw all the people who would
would fall into the trap
they'd say do you think black lives
matter yes yes i do
and not only do i think black lives
matter but i also think
all cancelled you're canceled
and you're thinking wait a minute why am
i canceled i just agreed with you
black lives matter but i'm even more
liberal than that because i'm saying
other people matter
like how about other people
nice try racist saying other people
matter and
other brown people matter you just said
black people don't matter no that's the
opposite of what i just said
i said they totally matter and other
people are important too
that's a white supremacist if i ever saw
one
right so in terms of persuasion it was
brilliant
because it just shut down the other side
but do you think there's a high ground
that can get above black lives matter
do you think that anybody with any
amount of persuasion ability
could high ground that meaning meaning
say something
that everybody would recognize is either
more important or more
true than this thing which is also
deeply important and deeply true
black lives matter could is there
anything above that
well honestly i thought no but it turns
out
that there's a young woman named denisha
merriweather
who's the founder of uh i think the
group is
black minds matter
black minds matter
and i guess the emphasis is going to be
on school choice
it's pretty good isn't it black
minds matter i give you two choices
black lives matter
or black minds matter
it's good it's good and it's also coming
from
a young black woman so it's going to
carry you know
different credibility than if it came
from from me for example
and she's going after teachers unions
here's
here's how i plan to help
my first question is this was this
luck because you know as a trained
persuader when i see this
i just stop and i go
okay this is a pretty young person
behind this
is there somebody behind the young
person because remember when
aoc was making a big splash early on and
people were saying oh you know
there's she's got this mentor who's
really the
you know the power behind her now which
i always thought was
unfair by the way i mean i'm sure he had
some influence but
i think that was unfair um but when i
see somebody
do this this being finding something
that's this powerful as a persuasion
starting point i wonder did this come
from
somebody this young because you'd have
to be
pretty pretty experienced to
intentionally
come up with something that almost
looked impossible to me
find a higher high ground than black
lives matter that even
black people would say yeah that's
better
that's pretty good so when you see this
you gotta ask is it an
accident if it's not an accident there's
a new force to be reckoned with
that we don't quite understand and we
might we might see more of it
um here's what i'd like to add and i
tweeted this today i think
that um teachers unions are the main
source of gun violence
what do you think when you hear that
teachers unions are the main source of
gun violence
it's true it's not even a little bit
untrue
because if our school system were better
everybody would have more options crime
would be less
there would be fewer reasons and
atmospheres and situations and
neighborhoods
in which gun violence is routine
and i don't think it's a stretch to say
that without teachers unions you would
already have
school choice it would be a huge
advantage to
all low-income people who could have
some chance of getting there
if we change the funding to change to
follow the student instead of the school
which is the big trend now um here's
another one
teachers unions are the main source of
white supremacy
i used to say the teachers unions were
the main source of
systemic racism and while people would
say to themselves yeah i get that
intellectually what you're saying
is that you can't you can't even things
up until you get the schools right
right if everybody doesn't have equal
schools you're pretty much
doomed to have an average this is good
in the long run
you can't get there so the school
systems are the main source
of systemic racism which is not
hyperbole by the way
it's not it's not just persuasion for
persuasion psych
literally truly factually unambiguously
teaches unions are the main course of
systemic racism
but persuasion wise it's more powerful
if you say
white supremacy because i didn't
weaponize that word
or those words that got weaponized by
the people i'm talking to
so once they've weaponized it it's a
weapon
you've seen trump take fake news out of
the hands of his
opponents turn the gun around and use it
against them
it works once once a term has been
weaponized
it's your weapon too right once it's
weaponized
so imagine if you will
a white republican leader i'll just
throw out some names
just because they're prominent imagine a
tom cotton
ron desantis i'm talking about people
who are
considered reasonable right imagine a
ted cruz
you know maybe less reasonable according
to the left but
still a you know a serious person
imagine them saying teachers unions are
the main source of white supremacy and
here's the argument
because if you don't fix them whoever's
in charge will stay there
right if you don't fix the schools
whoever you think is in charge of the
country
stays there because the rich people and
the white people will
have school choice because they have
money so they they can
have more choice they can move to a
better neighborhood
better schools so if you want to
maintain white supremacy
the number one thing nothing's even
close
if you said what's the number one thing
it's teachers unions because they're
ruining the whole school system
which causes everything to be impossible
after that
so denisha merriweather if you can find
her on twitter give her a follow
denisha spelled d-e-n-i-s-h-a
merowether m-e-r-r-i-d i'm sorry
m-e-r-r-i and then the word weather is
the rest of it
so give her a follow she's on the right
track
i've got a question for you oh here's
another
one critical race theory causes gun
violence
do you believe that critical teaching
critical race theory
causes gun violence
it almost has to doesn't it because the
whole point of
uh critical race theory is to demonize
um part of the public
and and cause us to hate each other for
reasons that we didn't need to
right and if you create uh animosity
you know you carve out enemies where
enemies didn't have to be
how does that not affect violence
i feel like it's it's just you know a
equals
a leads to b it's got to happen so
if you argue that there are benefits of
critical race theory
um and obviously the people promoting it
believe there are
you should not ignore the fact that it
almost certainly is going to increase
gun violence in the long run
i don't know how it wouldn't uh here's a
provocative question are black
republicans happier than black
democrats go
what do you think
um of course i've never seen any uh
data that was suggested either way but
doesn't it feel obvious
i saw one person say no so far and all
the rest are yes
all the rest are yes now of course
you're probably
more republicans than anything else on
this broadcast here
but it looks obvious to me
i don't know if it's true because you
could easily be
you know fooled by stuff like that
here's why i think it's obviously true
if you are sold a story where you're you
are a victim
and that's why you are where you are
you're going to feel like a victim
if you're sold a story let's say more
republican leaning story
where your success is entirely up to you
how do you feel even if you're not
succeeding
yet but you feel your success is
entirely up to you
don't you feel better i would feel like
you would have mental health problems
if you had been convinced that you were
a victim and there's
you know not much you can do about it
except complain
i've got a feeling if we if anybody ever
did this survey
now of course you wouldn't know what his
cause and what its effect right
so its cause and effect could be a
little messier but i'll bet you would
find that it would be a fact
and i'll bet it wouldn't even be close
i'll bet the the difference would be
pretty significant
now i'd love to i'd love to know i'm
wrong because if i'm wrong about this
it would reveal how easily i could be
fooled by
you know misleading observational
anecdotal stuff
which is always a good thing to learn
you can't learn that enough really
um all right
so and i wonder if it let's say that
fact
came out let's say some polling company
found a way to pull this i might be hard
but i suppose you could do it
and just find out that having a let's
say a republican
strategy and philosophy makes you
happier
now what would what would restrict
black americans from let's say being
republicans
would it be because republicans are
really religious on the whole
but black americans are not no
that's a match right on religious stuff
black americans and right-leaning
republicans pretty much a match
both love their god both want to go to
church both
consider it you know on average of
course everybody's different but on
average
so if you've got the religion thing
right
all you're talking about is sort of a
strategy
and i don't think that the republicans
have ever done a good job
of selling republicanism as a success
strategy
yeah what happened when you heard me say
that
selling the republican platform
as a personal success strategy
because it is it happens to be you know
politics is how we talk about it and
frame it but it's about you personally
it's about you personally taking control
of your life
getting your education staying out of
jail
you know praying to your god it's
optional
but it's part of it right and
it seems to me that the republicans are
just selling their
brand all wrong because they talk about
the policies
and that's sort of the national stuff
and of course they have to but the real
the powerful part of being a republican
isn't the policies
the powerful part is the life strategy
stuff
and i gotta tell you the minute
i don't know if this could ever happen
i'm not sure i would predict it
but there's nothing to stop it except
the fake news
actually the fake news is a pretty big
force but if the fake news were taken
out of the picture
and and we were not being continually
brainwashed to hate each other
if you were black and you're american
and you're presented with these two
things we've got two different
philosophies
one of them consistently produces good
results and here's the poll
showing that these people are happier
it happens to be called republicanism
you might disagree with some of the
policies
but you know how you could best change
republican policies
try being a republican if if black
people
in numbers decided to support
republicans
republicans would quite quickly
modify their most extreme things that
are the most problematic
it would happen automatically so if you
want republicans to act differently
become a republican
and if you want to be personally
successful in your life
the republicans have the formula forget
about the policies
they just have the formula for personal
success that's completely separate from
you know what do you do with world
events and what your tax rate is that's
that's a whole different topic
but just taking care of yourself getting
your education
protecting yourself knowing your
constitutional rights
treating everybody the same based on you
know what they do
not their you know anything else that's
really republican
somebody says but you're not a
republican i'm not i do not
identify as republican and probably
never will
but it is true that republicans have a
a philosophy which is more effective
there's just no doubt about it i don't
think anybody could argue that in terms
of results
um oh somebody says the pro-choice thing
uh let me put this out there as a
question
do black americans differ
that much with republicans on abortion
i don't know the answer to that but i
feel as though at least the religious
part of black america might be closer to
the republicans than i'm aware of
but and i don't think that that
necessarily is going to be a deal
breaker actually
um we got a lot of questions on gun
control i don't like talking about that
because it's just a power
question gun control is not about what's
right or what's wrong
it's not about how many people died it's
not about any of that
it's just a power so we're doing this
pretend argument about
gun control but it's just all pretend
it's it's just nothing but power there
are some people who are better off
with them there are some people
certainly
would be better off with fewer than in
their community
but they're different people so the
people who are better off with them
and those exist let's say you're a rural
person
it's your only defense of course you're
better off with them
or at least you're better off with a
choice so
every argument we make about you know
this will change the number of people
who die
or which is important i don't want to
mock it but
these are all fake arguments there is no
real argument about guns
except some people are better off with
them
definitely some people would be better
off without them
even without them in the area definitely
and and pretending that you can you can
solve that by arguing
or or your constitutional argument or
your debate
you know your reasons your your data
it's all irrelevant
and and if we can't like wake up from
this dream sequence
where we imagine this is some kind of an
intellectual exercise
where if you say the right thing you'll
convince the other side there's nothing
like that happening
there's just people who are better off
with them who want to keep them
people are better off without them would
like to have less of them
that's it yeah it's naked power
all right um that
is my show for today i'm going to wait a
moment to see if you have any
comments but i think we've done our job
for the day
um yeah and everybody has their own view
of the constitution that's right
all right do you think multiplayer
virtual reality
first person wait that was an
interesting question
hey scott uh juan asks hey scott do you
think multiplayer virtual reality first
person
shooters would increase or decrease
violence in other words do i think
violent video games
uh increase violence the answer is yes
yes
i believe our culture in general if you
turn on the tv and watch an action movie
it's about people getting shot
right unless it's an old time movie
where they're using swords to kill each
other
but basically our entertainment is
entirely
around violence you don't think that
makes us more violent
of course it does and
and while we might not be able to find a
link
between let's say getting primed for
violence by video games and then
committing it
we might not find that direct link but
what are you going to do if your mind
snaps and you decide to do something bad
like there you've got this mental
condition and you're going to do
something really bad
what do you choose to do well what you
choose to do is whatever is on the top
of your mind
like what what you've experienced
recently zero people
have done hand grenade attacks now it's
harder to get a hand to grade right
but people will do the kind of attack
that's in the top of their mind and
because the news is covering non-stop
mass shootings you'll have more mass
shootings
you'll have more mass shootings because
of video games you'll have more mass
shootings because of the way the news
covers it
you'll have more mass shootings because
of the coronavirus lockdown
you'll have more mass shootings because
teachers unions
you know basically our entire society
is guiding us toward more mass shootings
right so the way to fix them
is that you'd have to fix everything
but there's a trade-off here and it's an
ugly one
and i almost hate to mention it
the violence is all men right i mean for
all practical purposes it's a
male violence problem what would happen
to the united states
if we did a serious effort
to reduce male violence
it feels like a big problem right i mean
obviously it's a big problem
lots of people dying but suppose you
succeeded
suppose you succeeded in making american
men
less violent what would you have
you know where i'm heading here right
it's the thing nobody wants to say out
loud
america is great because
the men are violent
as hell
i wish that were not true right i'm not
i'm not if it sounds like i'm being a
cheerleader for violence
i'm not nobody is a cheerleader for
violence that's not even a thing
but it is just a fact that
violence is an asset and if you have it
on your side
your side might do well you know all
other things have to be considered
if you're a criminal violence might not
work out for you but if you're a country
violence is a national asset and
when other countries look at us do they
not say
they're crazy do you know why
afghanistan can repel
every major world power it takes a long
time
but afghanistan can do it apparently
consistently
hey russia good try you're out of here
hey united states
nice try you're out of here what's one
of the biggest
assets that the afghan men
the men what is their biggest asset
i would like permission for cursing
there will be a curse word coming up
it's the only one i saved it for the end
you ready one of the super powers
that the afghan man men have is that
they're crazy
i'm not wrong you can count on them
not quitting even when a reasonable
person should absolutely quit
they're not going to do it they are
violent like violence you've never even
seen
and they're not going to stop and you
know it's true
why are we leaving afghanistan because
their men
are too violent for a superpower
that's real right that's real
and i have to think that other countries
look at the united states a little bit
the same way
it's like they seem a little
trigger-happy over there maybe when
we're negotiating we'll take that into
account
maybe when we're deciding to militarily
oppose them
we'll take into the account that they
will kill us for entertainment
you know you never want to get in a
fight with somebody who enjoys fighting
that's the best advice i could ever give
you never get in a fight
with somebody who enjoys fighting that's
not going to work out well
in the united states uses violence for
entertainment
do you want to get a fight with somebody
who uses violence for
entertainment that's the worst person to
get into a fight with
so uh nobody's in favor of violence
that would be a dumb position no nobody
is but it's just a fact that violence is
an asset
it's just a fact and if you can't
acknowledge that you'll be confused
about the world
yeah so um we do need to do something
about the gun violence but i don't have
any special ideas other than fixing the
school systems
and that takes a while all right that's
all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
