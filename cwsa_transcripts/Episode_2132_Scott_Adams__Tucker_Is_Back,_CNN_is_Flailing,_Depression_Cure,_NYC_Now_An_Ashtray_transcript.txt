good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization the best
thing you've ever seen in your whole
life if you'd like it to be even better
I'll bet you could do that all you need
is a cup or a mug or a glass of tanker
chalices die and a canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
dopamine to this day a thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
ah
delightful
all right well
uh let's see we got stories
turns out New York City and much of the
Northeast
is uh under a
thick veil of smoke from Canadian forest
fires
I'll tell you
Canada is just becoming a troubled
country isn't it
you know you think they're up there just
minding their own business sipping some
Molson
wrestling with the
um the the mooses the mice whatever they
do up there I don't really know uh but
uh it's causing a lot of smoke
and uh we found the only way to make New
York City less hospitable
so the good news is that it's sort of
good news bad situation so the bad news
is it's really hard to breathe
in in New York City
so if you're you know if you're going to
do calling balls and Strikes you'd say
the bad part is they can't breathe and
it's giving them all asthma and
headaches that's the bad part of all
that smoke on the plus side you can't
see the crime coming
I know that's not a lot because the
crime will still come but you don't see
it as quickly and I think that's an
upgrade
because you'll you'll suffer less
because you don't see it coming
it still comes either way
so I'd get out of New York City as soon
as you can
there is however a hope for people who
stay in New York City
uh because researchers have found the
reason that mushrooms and LSD work
they found the blah blah blah that binds
to the blah blah blah I don't want to
get too technical here but there's a
thing that binds to a thing
and the way they found it is they looked
at
LSD as well as psilocybin
because both of those are implicated in
curing depression they were trying to
find out what's going on here it turns
out that the the the thing that binds in
the hallucinogens binds way better than
the off-the-shelf stuff that is supposed
to treat uh treat depression so it does
what the prescription drugs do but a
hundred times better
without negative consequences
because you could just do your
hallucinogens and then be done with it
but if you're on depression meds you're
just taking them all the time
so you've got the you got the side
effects forever
whereas if you do LSD
or psilocybin you've got the you know
you've got an interesting trip and then
it's over and then your depression is
lessened
but they figured out how to isolate the
the part that helps you with your
depression
separate from the part that gets you in
your trip
so that that might give them an Avenue
to commercialize it
because the first thing that your drug
company wants to do is take the fun out
of your drugs am I right
takes the fun out of it but maybe it'll
cure your depression
so that would be worthwhile I guess
um now the biggest story I think today a
lot of big stories but none bigger than
this
according to an article in the guardian
evolutionary biologists
and this is important work you know
sometimes you think science
is not getting it done you know we don't
trust science may have lied to us you
know maybe their models are not all that
accurate and stuff so we do a lot of
criticizing the science but when they do
good work like this well what I'll tell
you about here
you have to give them some credit so
what the evolutionary biologists have
done according to the guardian
they've traced back the origins of
masturbations and they found out which
monkeys started it
so we got that going for us now they
think that it started uh 40 million
years ago no how long ago
uh yeah like
10 the first humans by tens of millions
of years so yeah 40 million years ago
uh evolutionary biologists have
determined if they've discovered the
first masturbating monkeys
now how do you think they determine that
how do you think an evolutionary
biologist can reach back in time
40 million years
and determine which monkeys were beating
off
does that sound like something that
really happened
in the actual real world Guardian
did they really know which monkeys were
beating off I don't think so
I would call this another story where
science is just making itself look
ridiculous
because first of all we don't really
need to know which monkeys beat off
first
I'm happy to know that Evolution after
40 million years brought us to the point
where Jeffrey tubin can do it on Zoom
so I mean there's an interesting
evolutionary
story there but other than that did it
matter what was it terribly important
why monkeys are masturbating
somebody got paid for that somebody got
paid for that and then after they got
paid to figure out which monkeys are
masturbating apparently they just made
up the answer
I don't know what do you think Eric
I don't know
40 billion years ago let's say the
monkeys were getting busy is anybody get
a check
how could they check we can't even check
well why are we claiming that we know
nobody else will know the difference
either all right monkeys beat off 40
million years ago
could you have a lower opinion of
science right now
I mean after we get through the pandemic
you're expecting some big wins for
science
so far the only win as they figure down
how to cure your depression without you
having a good time
that was the first story we figured out
how to cure your depression but we've
removed the part where you have a really
good time while it happens
that's it that's what science
gave you
they took away the fun and they kept the
drug
uh
and they figured out that monkeys were
bad or were beating off 40 million years
ago yeah how does that help you with
your climate change
well speaking of uh masturbating monkeys
there's a story from CNN
anybody anybody
best Segway of any podcast ever
yes for masturbating monkeys to CNN
their CEO Chris licked or liked or we
never bothered to alert his name because
we didn't think he's staying
I never bothered to figure out how to
pronounce his last name I just figured
he wasn't gonna last
uh Chris let's call him Chris licked or
liked or something
uh anyway
so I wondered if CNN would cover the
story of their own problems and they did
the way they covered it was this was
unbelievable uh so this is CNN's own
words Chris light or Licht or Licht or
Lex or whatever the embattled chief
executive and chairman of CNN so they
called their own CEO and battled uh who
is brief one year tenure at the network
was stained by a series of severe
missteps
severe missteps
and then it and then the article links
to the example of the biggest of all the
missteps what do you think the article
was
what do you think was his big misstep
having Trump on the town hall
yeah the only successful thing the CNN
did all year
it was the only success they had
CNN called it a big failure because the
person who is most likely to be your
next president of the United States
was featured on their Network
and they can't have that because their
job is to prevent him from being present
so he gets fired for being probably for
being a adult white guy but that wasn't
mentioned instead it was mentioned that
he had helped another adult white guy
Trump
but it's not over right it's not about
race it's not about race it's not about
gender he was replaced by a woman
temporarily
um now would you like to take bets
do you believe that he could be replaced
by another adult white man
do you think there's any chance that
could happen to CNN
any chance
no now their next hire will be based on
race and gender
and if they don't pick a trans for that
job
well I call them haters and I would say
that would be a severe misstep a severe
misstep I think they need a
yeah
possibly a trans
so that's what I like to see I'd like to
see them walk the walk and talk the talk
they should do what they say and get
themselves a a properly diverse CEO
well it looks like Trump broke them
the trail of Destruction that Trump has
left
but I feel like you finished off CNN
so I wonder if anything else is
happening that would be relevant to give
us context to this story about the
struggling CNN whose best Prime Time
Shows get about 300 000 viewers
about three hundred thousand
how would that compare to other things
that we're seeing lately you'll see 300
000 viewers oh
well there's a story by uh so Robert F
Kennedy Jr was saying on a podcast with
I think Jordan Peterson that he thinks
the 2024 election will be decided by
podcasts
you think she'll be podcast not Network
television
now did you hear anybody else say that
make that prediction
yeah that's exactly what I said so but
it's not I wouldn't say that's a hundred
percent of the story
yeah uh I would say the story is you can
use the podcast to get enough traction
that then the networks will cover you
because if you don't get to the networks
the old people will never know you exist
and if the old people don't know you
exist you're not getting elected
so the podcast might give you some life
and they might be able to test you out
and get some good quotes and some viral
videos and all that stuff which is great
but you're still going to need to get on
TV
um and you know when it comes out to the
final two they will be on TV so I guess
I guess that takes care of itself when
you get to the final two but if you're
running in the primaries you're trying
to make a dent it's all podcasts and I
would say that's one of the best things
that's happened to the country
uh you know we we like to focus on all
the negative
but wow
the I would say this year you really see
the maturity of the podcasting you know
network is it's not just that the uh the
technology and the audience and
everything is maturing
is that the type of voices you get are
completely different they're completely
different you know there never was a Joe
Rogan
you know you're not going to see a
Jordan Peterson on network news
uh same with you know Ben Shapiro same
with me there's a lot of voices that are
now interesting and different and
actually making an impact
speaking of that you may have heard that
Tucker Carlson is back he's back but
he's on Twitter so he did his first
little video maybe you could call it a
show I don't know what he's going to
call it an episode but it was one
monologue basically it is similar to how
he used to do on his Fox News and uh I
wonder how that did poor
poor talker he gets kicked off a show
that was killing CNN by about ten to one
in viewership he would have maybe four
million when CNN would have less than
four hundred thousand so he was about 10
times bigger than CNN but then he uh
that he lost his gig on Fox News so the
poor guy poor poor Tucker Carlson has to
take his show to Twitter and
let me see an update uh how many numbers
uh views did he get on his little tiny
little
64 million
64 million
no 68. I'm sorry update 68 million
let me say that again
CNN prime time
three hundred thousand to four hundred
thousand people
Fox News Tucker Carlson
10 times that 4 million
Tucker Carlson on Twitter
uh 15 times that so far
20 times it
now I don't know how many people watch
the video because somebody said that
that number might be Impressions not
views yeah I'm seeing that in the
comments so so apparently it's
Impressions not views
so that doesn't mean they watched it it
means they showed up for them to watch
it but
yeah but the 68 million impressions
probably translates into the biggest
audience
for a news person of all time that's my
guess yeah I mean it could be six
million but it would be the it would
still be record-breaking
so good for Tucker and how did
um
and how did uh Tucker do well he's got a
technique that uh I think Hannity does
this a little bit but Tucker perfected
it
where you say a bunch of things that you
know your audience agrees with and they
they really have some you know emotion
in it so you're like oh yeah that's true
oh that's true oh that's true and then
he gets to the thing that's not quite
proven
you know after you've been noddling
along yeah that's true that's true
that's true that's true and I guess to
the last thing and you're still nodding
when he says it you're like oh
Maybe
and he did that with the the uh he
starts with Nordstrom too and you're
like you know we Nordstrom too it turns
out that the ukrainians uh and the
Americans were behind the blowing it up
and his audience is like yup yup we knew
that I mean it wasn't official but we
knew that absolutely absolutely
Nordstrom too and uh and Biden lied to
the country about it said they didn't
know anything about it yep
and then he goes to the Ukraine Dam
and now you're like and he says the
Ukraine Dam almost certainly was done by
Ukraine because it was in Russian
territory
and you know you don't really blow up a
dam in your own territory
I mean there's some speculation about
maybe there's some Advantage but not
really right
so then talk to goes from the north
stream thing which is pretty much
confirmed
to the damn thing which is not confirmed
but you pretty much know it's true
right so now you've gone from certainly
true
to almost probably true
that Ukraine was behind it and then
after you're still nodding along yep yep
almost probably true I'll bet you you
crane did blow up that Dam and the next
thing you know he's talking about the
aliens being real and The Whistleblower
has the goods and you're like yep and
aliens
um
okay I guess so aliens too I'm I'm on
board let's go with the aliens
uh I still believe there are no aliens
but
um and I'm not going to criticize Tucker
for this because he does what
Joe Rogan does and I call it
recreational beliefs
recreational beliefs it's different from
actually believing something
so recreational belief would be like
when I see stories about the pyramids
and the story will be that the aliens
built them or where the story is that
there was an ancient civilization on
America and we've lost their technology
I don't know if any of that's true
but I like to believe it recreationally
you know what I mean I'll believe it ish
because it's fun I just enjoy it
so when Tucker talks about the aliens
it's either the biggest story in the
history of human civilization
or it's just fun to believe it it's just
kind of fun so I don't care if it's true
or not I don't care if he believes it or
not it's recreational yeah it's it's
Bigfoot news and if you can just enjoy
it for the fun of it
that's good let's just enjoy it for the
fun of it I don't believe there are any
aliens
could be wrong I hope I'm wrong that
would be the greatest thing ever I would
love to be wrong about that I mean I
really really love to be wrong about it
until they'll kill us
well uh
Mike Pence is in the race
and let me tell you all the interesting
Parts about that
okay there are no interesting Parts
about that
um what he's offering you is uh Trump's
policy but without the fund
Trump's policy is without the fun
I believe that Mike Pence would be in
favor of taking the fun out of the
hallucinogenics to help you cure the
depression
yes I'm going to give you Trump's
policies but with none of the
interesting fun parts
we'll just get the job done you know
what I hate about that
the thing I hate about it it's like a
really good proposition
it's a really good offer it's like a
really good offer like a really really
good offer then nobody's going to take
poor guy I have so much respect for Mike
Pence
but it just doesn't translate into
excitement right he's basically the guy
who just makes the right decisions one
time after another
and that doesn't get you to
the presidency I don't think
but no I have immense respect for Mike
Pence I'm sure I don't agree with him on
everything policy wise I'm sure we would
have some differences but uh he's a
solid guy I like that he's in the race
and I will I will add him to my list of
people who would be perfectly acceptable
presidents
left and right we we now have we have
the best set of choices I've ever seen
four interesting and capable young
people now Biden is the only person
running that I think is incapable
uh everybody else they've got something
to offer I think Biden's the only
problem
all right well we like drama in our
politics so he's just not breaking that
um
there's a news story that's
I don't know what to think of it yet so
you know that uh representative Comer
and Senator Chuck Grassley are after the
FBI saying that the FBI has a document
which apparently they've seen in person
and they would like that document to be
you know entered into the record and
made public I think I think made public
so that uh we could say apparently it's
an accusation
about Biden taking a bribe
now that would be a pretty big
accusation now the FBI does not want
that available but they did offer to
show it to Comer and Grassley so they've
seen it so they know it they know it
exists
and the FBI says it's part of an ongoing
investigation so they don't want to make
it public
now here's the thing
I'm not sure I disagree with the FBI on
this
what do you think
because if it is an ongoing
investigation
that means they will soon be able to
determine if the accusation is valid or
not
right
and wouldn't you rather only see
accusations that have at least a little
bit of checking out to make sure they're
valid
because otherwise you're just maligning
somebody who doesn't have a comment
right there must be lots of accusations
that don't pan out
so I'm a little bit on the fence on this
one because in terms of you know
innocent until proof and guilty uh
keeping this stuff out of the news until
you've looked into it makes sense on the
other hand it also seems like a
transparent attempt to keep it out of
the news because it would be bad for
Biden
well I don't know that that's bad I
don't think you should take out a
president on a rumor or an allegation
on the other hand every rumor and
allegation about Trump became known
so at what point do we have a right to
know the allegations
you know you can make an argument that
the public has a right to know
especially an allegation of that
magnitude it would be the ultimate
allegation but
on the other hand because we got two
hands
I think you should be innocent until
proven guilty and I don't think every
accusation somebody makes should be
public
so I don't know where to end up on this
I guess I'd have to see the document but
I don't know that we will
so the government can just keep this
from you for whatever reason
uh speaking of the
the FBI Rasmussen did a poll on the FBI
and found out its popularity here
uh
well not popularity but 60 of likely us
voters believe it is likely that top
officials at the FBI
helped cover up wrongdoing by Biden or
his family members
60 percent of the country
thinks the FBI was in on
it on a plot
60 percent
oh my God so that would include
basically every Republican uh but a
slice of other people too Independence
and whatnot
that's insane
insane but true
here's a story that didn't get a lot of
uh attention but apparently it's true I
saw it on Twitter
that American manufacturing is way up
did you know that
talk about like the best news so at the
same time that China's exports are down
I think seven and a half percent if you
can believe any numbers enter China so
China's exports are down seven and a
half percent
and
American chip making and the basically
the activity that predicts Manufacturing
booming is happening so all of the
Investments and plants and Manufacturing
assets are happening so at the moment
we're undergoing
a manufacturing boom and it does seem to
be related to Biden policies it does
seem to be related to the the chips
specifically the chips act that's trying
to bring chips back to America
so I hate to say it but it looks like
the well no I don't hate to say it
that's the wrong thing it looks like
Biden might have a win on this
what do you think is this a clean win
because I think I think Trump would have
done it
to me it looked like a policy that
probably just made sense we had to
repatriate some of those Industries
no you're not willing to give them
credit for that
yeah I don't think it's a clean bill
none of them are there's always
something that you don't like but if it
gets the job done you're not going to
give them credit if it actually brings
chip manufacturing back onto our shore
you're not going to say that's a clean
one
you're going to be tough tough grading
on this aren't you
all right
by the way the reason the reason you
watch me is that I don't just take one
side all the time
that's that's the point of the point of
what I do
that would be useless if I did
all right uh so keep an eye on that
um Apple's a new iOS has some new
features and one of them is it will
block you it'll block a naughty nude
picture that's unsolicited so send
somebody sends you a picture it'll block
it until you choose to see it I guess
so
I'm wondering if this is the end of uh
the end of smartphones
I I have this weird theory that 20 of
all electronic travel traffic is Dick
Bix
what happens if if Apple gets rid of
dick pics
I mean the the total internet traffic is
just gonna
fall through the floor
uh so you got that and apparently
they've changed it so that the
autocorrect will not will no longer
change the f word to the word duck
so
the number of times I've I have typed
this ducking thing or that ducking thing
except I didn't say ducking and it
changed it to ducking oh my God it was
one of the things I've hated the most
about my phone
and the the reason I hated it is not
because it's an error or a bad user
interface I hated it because
it felt like it was censoring me
do you know what I mean did you have
that feeling it felt personal it didn't
feel like a mistake it felt like it was
yeah scolding exactly it felt like
somebody was telling me what I can and
cannot say in my private conversations
and it really was offensive to me that
that's the only auto correct that I
found offensive everything else was okay
but they changed it so that's cool
um
I should tell you that I sold all my
Apple stock because I I don't know if
they have an answer to AI yet and I
don't think
um
I don't think the
the glasses thing is going to be big
what do you think
well what's your guess on the what do
you call it the mixed reality headsets I
say it's not going to be big
I think it's going to be Apple watch
like
you know sort of a maybe Gamers will
like it maybe it's a party trick
I just don't see everybody in the family
getting one
and not a certainly not at three
thousand dollars or thirty five hundred
or whatever yeah it obviously happening
so uh you could I knew that at some
point we would see the loss of Steve
Jobs
but apparently it's taken a while and I
I feel like this is the one this is the
one that stands out as something that I
think Steve Jobs would not have done
what do you think
do you think Steve Jobs would have
introduced this headset
he did the Lisa there's always that yeah
you think so maybe it's possible because
they were running out of ideas but I
don't know I I think if I were jobs
here's what I would have done I would
have introduced it as a alternative to
in-person school
this is what I would have done I would
have I would have introduced it as an
education tool and training tool only
and I would have limited it to that and
then every expert in the world would say
whoa that's the best thing anybody ever
did for education
right they would have said it was the
best thing that ever happened in
education because you could you know
watch your shows and watch you could
homeschool you could learn training you
could move objects around
but by making it the everything thing
that everybody might want but for a
whole bunch of different disparate
reasons I think the marketing just fell
apart
because I don't know why I want one
I want one for miscellaneous and various
reasons
I'll tell you what doesn't get me
excited miscellaneous and various
anything
right well I don't even think it's good
for porn I mean I I don't know but I
would imagine it doesn't really add much
for porn maybe it's okay for gamers
maybe it gives you a headache I don't
know I don't know if it works with my
glasses on who knows but
I I
think Steve Jobs would have said we've
developed the greatest product ever for
homeschooling and for corporate training
and everything else
and then build it from there then it
would look like the biggest hit of all
time because he would just own that
category and then it would grow from
there that's the way I would if I was if
I were alive and Steve Jobs
all right
what else is going on
um
not a lot
looks like that was about all that's
going on is there anything else
happening that I've missed
aliens
well how many of you believe that the
aliens are not only visiting Earth but
the the government has their ships and
their dead bodies how many believe
that's true
go I won't mock you
I will not mock you you can you can
admit
I see almost nobody all right this looks
like 10 yeses and the rest or no is that
because I talked to you out of it I feel
like it may have
I may have embarrassed you out of that
belief
it's all knows okay
well I was not expecting that I actually
thought it'd be close to half yes but it
looks like it's almost all knows
we got we do have yeses but it's at
least 80 notice it looks like
all right
um
now you know I'm just going to jump
around a few things
um as I'm watching uh RFK Jr navigate
all the podcasts
the the one thing that I feel deeply uh
bad for him about
is that he gets asked the same questions
and he has to give the same long
explanations which are excellent by the
way if you haven't heard his long
explanations of how we got where we are
with big Pharma it's it's riveting like
it's really tight and complete and a
good story
but I think he ends up telling that
story on every podcast so he's probably
doing it three times a day do you know
how tired you get of telling your own
story three times a day
I tell you when I do a book tour which
by the way I'll be doing some kind of a
podcast book tour
um and over the summer
which were there so it's only maybe a
month or two so we'll see
uh but I'm gonna be really tired of
talking about myself after the first you
know 10 podcasts
uh uh the question
Cornell West entered the presidential
race is it official
Cornell West is in all right it's
official
I'm guessing he's running as a Democrat
he's in all right
and Chris Christie's into right
you know I I'm just waiting for a trump
to be asked about Chris Christie's uh
possibilities
I feel like he's going to say fat chance
I just feel like that's coming
what do you think about Chris Christie
becoming president Fat Chance
that seems like a typical Trump
all right
um
now I did look into the remember you
asked me about
RFK Jr wanting to quote execute people
who were opposed to climate change
how many of you thought he was referring
to just ordinary people who were opposed
to climate change and that he wanted
them jailed or executed
okay that I I've confirmed that was
never the case never said anything like
that he was talking about people who
were
polluting in a way that was killing
people
while lying about uh well creating
disinformation so that they could get
away with what they were doing so he was
talking about
way over the top corporate behavior that
killed people
corporate behavior in which people lied
intentionally
to do dangerous things that actually
killed people or damage them now in that
case if you say somebody should be
killed
or executed or go to jail because they
intentionally did something that killed
people like lots of people not even just
one person lots of people
if it's intentional
and it killed lots of people
it's not crazy to call for their
execution
that's not crazy
Mass murderers are typically executed
it's the same reason I'm calling for the
execution of cartels
and anybody we can get in China who's
involved we should kill them all because
they're Mass murderers
Mass murderers you have to kill
that's not negotiable or at least put
them away forever but you can't get away
with mass murder
nobody can get away with that I mean if
you can catch them you've got to treat
them in the harshest possible way and
there's no way around that that's not
negotiable
all right
um
a sterilizer
you know I do have this idea about crime
I would agree with the Democrats halfway
about crime which is too many people are
being picked up by police and put in
jail for too many things
there's something that has to stop that
but we didn't have a plan getting rid of
police was exactly the wrong thing
because then just people stole more
stuff
so I have a plan for decreasing crime
without police you ready for it
because I think technology can get us
there instead of taking somebody's
Freedom away
let's say they shoplifted and you don't
really want to put them in jail because
that's just going to cause some Cascade
of problems later
so what do you do
you can't let them steal
and at the same time you if you don't
want to put them in jail they're just
going to steal some more
so I would suggest that there might be a
middle ground here
in which you take away their privacy
so let me say this another way if you're
going to let a criminal and a jail
you owe me that information my
government
if you're letting somebody who who did
it let's say a violent crime and you let
them out of jail and then they walk into
my store
you owe me the information that
that guy that you let out in jail just
walked into my store
right his privacy
he lost that you lost your privacy when
you were dangerous as soon as you're
dangerous you don't get privacy because
I have a right to protect myself and I
have a right to that information I have
a right to his private information
right now maybe not illegal right but a
let's say a moral and ethical right
all right if a criminal is Led out of
jail because our justice system doesn't
want to keep him in there but he's
legitimately a risk either for
shoplifting or physical risk
I need to know where that is
all the time
because I want to stay away from them
I want to watch him if they come in my
store
I don't know what I could do about it in
these days but I certainly want to keep
an eye on them
take a picture at least
if they're dangerous I want to know to
get away
I want to know who to stay away from and
who not to
right
so
I believe we have the technology to take
somebody's privacy away
put a uh put an ankle bracelet on
if they take it off put them in jail
but I would just keep the ankle bracelet
on there forever as long as they keep
doing crimes
oh you did another crime well that's
another year of ankle bracelet so
imagine the criminal walking down the
sidewalk
and the people with their their
smartphones all get an alert and so they
just give them room or how about you
know that there's a dangerous person
somewhere
and so you keep an eye on them in case
you need to help somebody out
let's say you're on the subway and a
person with a violent criminal record
gets on well you would know to put them
in a headlock
okay that's too far
but you get my point right
if you're going to let them out you owe
the rest of us that information
not legally not constitutionally but you
 owe us
anybody disagree does anybody disagree
with that that that they owe us that
information if they're going to let
criminals out of jail you better tell us
all right yeah and I'm pretty adamant
about that now I don't mean necessarily
a first offender
right I don't think a first offender for
let's say shoplifting or something I
don't think at first offender needs to
have a like a privacy you know bracelet
on their ankle but if you're if you're
one of these arrested 42 times a year
people yeah you need a bracelet on your
ankle so I can stay the hell away from
you
all right it'll become a fashion
accessory
I'm all about that
all right yeah it'd be sort of a Scarlet
Letter but it would be temporary I mean
it would have to have some kind of time
out you couldn't put it on there forever
all right uh make them glow
tattoos
all right uh yeah CNN fired Chris licked
light we talked about that already
um girls would use it as a dating app oh
you were so cynical
but women do seem to like men who are
murderers and in prison for life so it's
a thing
that was done to you in high school for
smoking weed you were just made public
oh yeah that probably as well works yeah
so if somebody gets picked up then the
parents don't let them come over for the
sleepovers after that
oh yeah maybe maybe that Apple uh mixed
reality headset can help you see
criminals
oh my God it would actually do that
because all it needs is facial
recognition
if the criminals are in kind of some
system where their faces are known
then the the Apple mixed reality could
actually light people up in a crowd to
tell you the criminals were
I wonder if it could also tell you a
single
imagine going to an event go to a bar or
something you put it on and it just uses
facial recognition to tell you're single
based on their social media
can get pretty close to it of course
whether they wear a ring or not would
tell you that as well
all right
anything else is happening
could show you canceled cartoonists yeah
so people could stay away from me
I guess it works both ways
people want to stay away from me
oh the splc has labeled the moms for
Liberty as a hate group I don't know
enough about the moms for Liberty to
have an opinion on that but I have an
opinion on the splc which is I don't
think they're a credible organization
I'm sorry the splc the Southern poverty
and Law Center they they label people as
uh hate groups if you get labeled by
them
you're in bad shape
yeah and they they do seem to be a force
for evil that that does seem to be the
case at the splc
all right um no deal for t-shirts I'm
not really that much into merchandise
FDX yeah
uh
desantisk of the kidnapping mask
what about Tate
yeah we don't want to cut off the hands
of the thieves probably don't want to do
that
what's my handle on Twitter it's uh at
Scott Adams says
by the way I'm very proud of that uh
Twitter handle
because when I went to sign up for
Twitter of course you know my own name
was taken Etc so I had to figure out
some variant and I thought well if I'm
on here just saying stuff
I'll just put my name and then says
and it turns out that really worked
because when people quote me they quote
my Twitter handle as part of the
sentence and as Scott Adams says and
then they say whatever I tweeted
I've seen some people copy that the says
part
because there aren't that many things
you can do after all the good stuff is
taken
uh
what about the PGA I don't fight that I
don't know the golf news was not
interesting to me
you had a doctor to yours
all right Matt wall she's uh somebody
said that Matt Walsh's
video what is a woman got 180 million
impressions probably
uh
um I didn't say that Apple doesn't have
ai I said that they're behind
meaning that their s-i-r-i is it feels
like something from the 90s
and they have not announced anything
that looks interesting to me there yet
um
aliens have a different frequency from
us okay
all right
um
you work with somebody with my name
oh I'm sorry
you know I used to use a Google alert to
look for stories about myself in case
anything was important
and of course there are too many people
named Scott Adams so it kicks up lots of
stories about other people and I always
look I'm hoping that nobody with my name
ruins ruined my reputation
like I would have hated if there had
been a Scott Adams who became like a
serial killer or you know did some
heinous crime
and then it turns out I was the one who
ruined everyone I ruined the day for all
the other people
it turns out it turns out having my name
is a really bad deal
uh I think it's hilarious that I'm the
one who ruined the name
uh disgrace cartoonist
all right
uh
you and Trump ruin everything we do
I'm a destroyer of worlds
uh
I can't believe you would trust the
government with people's privacy
I don't think that happened
did that happen I'm not sure I saw
anything like that but
all right
was Mark Twain canceled
did that ever did that ever happen
somebody said Mark Twain got canceled I
don't remember Mark Twain he did
for oh for the n-word but not during his
life during his life he was never
canceled right
or was he
I don't know
have I ever met another Scott Adams I
have yes
uh I've met black Scott Adams too black
Scott Adams lives near me
he's got a lot of explaining how would
you like to be black Scott Adams now he
lived somewhere in my area I've met him
I feel so bad for him
uh
well I was but then I wasn't and maybe
I'll go back
did my ancestors owned slaves I don't
think my ancestors owned anything
I don't think they owned slaves I I once
I
did a uh what do you call it the
ancestor check when you check your
ancestry it actually found a will
for one of the Adam's ancestors and you
look at the the will you know the items
that are being left to the Next
Generation
and it is so revealing
so here were the items left in one of my
ancestors will
my good Copper Pot
that stick that I used to stir stuff
and a handkerchief
no I just I just made that up but some
of them were just cooking duels that was
it that that was the entirety of what my
ancestor owned was just some items that
you could hold in your hands that's it
that's all he owned no property no
slaves no nothing
and so but apparently starting with that
nothing
uh thanks to slavery I've prospered on
the backs of other Americans apparently
uh will you be open endorsed to migrants
I thought about it
I know that surprises you but I actually
thought about it I'm still thinking
about it
I wouldn't mind taking a family from
Mexico
it wouldn't be terrible
I mean if you have room
yeah now I wouldn't take you know I
wouldn't take some unattended males
but if you know if it was a family of
four with a real mom and dad and two
real kids maybe
yeah just for a month or something sure
I could see it
it's not out of the question I think
it's unlikely it's unlikely but it's not
out of the question
for how long I don't know month
whatever it takes
am I related to John Adams I'm not a
descendant of
but probably cousins
um
yeah I probably won't do it
but I don't rule it out
you know they are human beings after all
right
um
would you put them to work that's an
interesting question would I put them to
work
they would probably want to
they would probably volunteer so the
thing you don't understand about that
culture if you're not
sort of uh deeply in it
is that they're helpful by Nature I mean
they would offer to help
that would be automatic
now that's that's the South of the
Border culture there's a lot of people
coming in from other cultures who are
just using that passing point and that
would be different but if you told me it
would be an actual born in Central
America or Mexico and it was a family
I would have all positive feelings about
that except for the fact that you know
some laws are broken
yeah these are all just generalizations
you are correct big old generalizations
all right that's all I got for today uh
YouTube I'm gonna say bye until tomorrow
and let's see if we find those aliens
between now and then yay aliens let's
find them
