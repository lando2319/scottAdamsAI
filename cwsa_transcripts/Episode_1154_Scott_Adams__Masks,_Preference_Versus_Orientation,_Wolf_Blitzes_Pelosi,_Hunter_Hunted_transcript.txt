hey everybody
come on in it's time you found the right
place
this is where you have coffee with scott
adams the best part of the day
every single time and it's gonna happen
again
yeah the consistency of it is just crazy
and all you need is a copper bug or a
glass of tank or gels or stein a canteen
joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine 10
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the pandemic it's called the
simultaneous up it happens now
go
i um my vitamin d levels zooming
my white blood count
it's going crazy i hope you are
just as healthy as i am today i feel
like president trump
yeah that healthy that's crazy i know
all right so i've got a little quiz i
want you to think about
and then we'll get to it later all right
here's here's the quiz
let's say 85 percent of the people who
got to koved
wore masks what is the conclusion
because you're all rational people you
all know how to analyze things
this should be an easy one and i'm going
to get to this a little bit but i want
to i want to let it
just marinate with you a little bit okay
so 85 percent of the people who got
covered wore masks
what do you conclude about that we'll
get to that in a minute
uh but first uh last night i was going
to be on
msnbc as a guest with uh ari
melber but i got bumped uh
because the acb
supreme court hearings went long they
offered
to re to tape it but i decided to
decline the offer to
tape it and we'll just do it live some
other time
so i'll let you know when that happens
um
i saw i saw that the phrase black
trump was trending and i thought to
myself
oh it's a story about lebron james so i
went to see what
uh lebron james was doing because as you
know
who was it who came up with that name uh
somebody's calling
lebron james black trump because
because he was born with a lot of
advantages
and it turns out that the story is that
a lot of black trump
supporters on twitter were not real
black
supporters they were actually fake
accounts
and a number of them uh i guess there
were thousands of them and they vanished
now the funny thing is if you're a trump
supporter
you probably noticed a whole bunch
of black trump supporters that just sort
of appeared
in the last few months
i remember seeing them all and thinking
to myself
maybe could be real but
uh i guess we know the answer now uh
likewise there are a number of uh
a number of female
trump supporters on twitter who just
sort of appear around election time
and i'm waiting for them to disappear to
you
so i don't know who's behind that but
it's fairly transparent
did you see that trump tweeted a meme
in which it showed joe biden at a an old
folks
a home and uh instead of uh biden for
president
the p is crossed out so it's biden for
resident
a resident of an old folks home and it
shows shows him in his little wheelchair
in the middle of the old folks home
now it's really funny and of course
what makes it funny is that he did it at
all
you know if i send that to you you know
you say ah cartoonist send it to me it's
kind of amusing
but when the president of the united
states tweets that
it just becomes a whole different level
of funny because he's not supposed to
and he knows he's not supposed to and
that he does it anyway which is what
that's the joke the joke is not the meme
the joke is that he tweeted it and he's
not supposed to and he's just going to
do anything he's not supposed to
until something stops him so
so that's part of the fun uh now some
smart people noted
that being mean to senior citizens might
not be
the best election strategy when you're
already behind on senior citizens or
you're losing ground on senior
citizens but i don't know
this one's kind of a a break even
because it's sufficiently funny
that you get some points for that you
know it's part of
a larger strategy to keep the energy up
for his supporters
but i could see the point i can see the
point that anything that looks like it's
making fun of senior citizens
probably not the ideal time to do it but
as a person who does humor for a living
i appreciated it
might cost them the election but
sometimes a good joke
has a price that might be the price on
this one
it was totally worth it uh in
fun technology news there's a new
development in
solar cells that could double their
efficiency
fairly easily that's the the fun part
is that it won't be hard so this new
uh this new discovery is that this
chemical or a compound or whatever it is
called perovskitis or perovskites
or perovskites let's let's just assume
there's a word i can't pronounce
that's a there's a thing that they i
guess they can put it in liquid form and
then coat it on top of
uh existing solar cells to make them
more powerful
but you could also use them by
themselves to make solar cells
so here's how big a dealer could be
current
solar cells max out at about 22 percent
efficiency and it looks like using
current technology
you'd be capped at about 22 percent or
maybe somebody said
28 or something but anyway the no to
and this new chemical can bounce that up
to 28
but it could get up to 40 so we might be
able to take
solar from 22 percent to 40 percent
and that could be sort of a next
i don't know 24 months situation it's
not going to take forever to
commercialize this so if it works and
there's no downside that we haven't
discovered
solar cells could be twice as efficient
in two years now i i bring you back to
the atom's law of slow moving disasters
when you look at climate change if
nothing
improved and we just kept going the way
we were going
yeah probably a problem probably a
problem
in in my view but
how do you account for all the things
that will get invented in the next
80 years well who had this on their list
who who made their long-range climate
model
in which they wrote in to their
assumptions and
by 2022 solar cell efficiency will
double who had that
maybe they did i don't know but i would
guess that they do not have
technological developments in their
models
all right um so that's cool
uh did did you all see the video of
wolf blitzer attempting to
have a professional interview with nancy
pelosi
it didn't go well so nancy pelosi for
whatever reason she was
she was in a uh let's say a competitive
mood
so we'll put it that way you you can you
could put other
words on on her demeanor but i'll just
say she was competitive
and you have to see it just you could
just google
uh wolf blitzer and nancy pelosi it'll
pop right up
and what's funny about it is wolf
blitzer is sort of a
he's sort of a soft-spoken guy for a
for a television personality he looks
like he would be an
introvert that just also has a
television show
and so nancy's sort of in her aggressive
alpha alpha mode and he's just sort of
in his
you know low-key mode and she's talking
over him
and and he's talking under her and it's
like
it's not going well right she's talking
over she's aggressive
he's just trying to be professional
low-key yeah here
and then the last thing he says and the
topic was the
stimulus package and he was trying to
convey
the importance to nancy pelosi's own
district as well as the country about
getting some relief out there
for food fairly quickly and
he gets the he gets to the end of the
interview and he just
tosses this he just tosses in a line
about seeing nancy pelosi's uh
constituents
begging for food on the streets and he
just
he just sort of he just puts that shiv
in there nice and smooth
it's like the sharpest little ship you
don't even feel it going in
you're like what was that oh my goodness
there's a shiv it's all the way through
my abdomen
you have to see it just to see how
smoothly he put that in right at the end
before he signed off with her
it was it was tv magic so good job
wolfe blitzer um and as others have
noted
it feels like cnn and the anti-trump
people
might be feeling a little uh a little
more aggressive
about the democrats going after them
we'll see
i guess the uh william barr and the
the attorney general basically william
barr
uh there won't be any uh charges
based on all of the unmasking remember
all the big stories about
susan rice and the unmasking and too
many
americans got unmasked which means that
they could be
surveilled by the government apparently
nothi nothing about that was illegal in
any way that could be proven in a court
of law
here's the thing that bothers me about
the
entire russia collusion
hoax all of the people involved from the
department of justice the fbi
the cia you know everybody
they're all high-end operators meaning
they're
they're either lawyers themselves or
they've been around lawyers or they're
working with lawyers
so they know how to stay out of trouble
and i have this
this bad feeling that there will be an
actual documented
coup against the united states the
legally elected government
the trump administration in the first
term
and that it would be proven and known
and historical fact
and still no real crimes
except for the one lawyer who maybe
falsified something on a document
might be the only one because everybody
else sort of knows where the line is
and they know they can pretend to know
something they don't and that's not
illegal
most of the time they know they can over
interpret data
probably get away with it and just say
oops oops i guess we made a mistake but
it's not illegal
so it's starting to look
uh yeah it's starting to look like
everybody's going to get away with it
uh which is alarming um
so i turned on the amy coney barrett
hearings yesterday and of course it
lasted many hours but i happened to turn
it on
at an especially interesting part i
caught
ben sass senator's ass you know
talking to barrett and i thought to
myself
wow he's asking really
professional good questions he's adding
context
he's so well spoken he's obviously very
smart very well informed
and then she's answering and her answers
are just like you know
cracklingly brilliant you know she's
she's she's super smart
that's pretty obvious um and these two
people
who were you know one being nominated to
the the highest court
the other serving in you know our
highest
uh elected capacity as a senator and who
is not a president
and i thought i'm really proud of my
country
those two people talking made me feel
good about america
honestly because they were both just so
smart and well-spoken and professional
etc
and then chris coons gets up for the
for the democrats and i'm thinking okay
okay here's
i guess the the happy part's over you
expect the republican will be a little
kinder to the nominee and then chris
coons
questions her and even though it was uh
i guess you could call it
hostile questioning because he's on the
other side but completely polite
completely professional all of his
points
well well reasoned
completely rational even if you don't
like where he was going
and i thought to myself damn this guy's
good too
this guy's really good he's on the other
team
you know maybe from you i've certainly
heard him say things i didn't agree with
in the past but he's a
smart capable really good at what he
does
at least in terms of public presentation
that's all i know
so there were there were three of these
professionals and again
you know barrett was amazing with their
answers very strong
and i really i had this i had a moment
i had a moment you probably had this
this experience if you're american there
are times when you fall in love with
america
have you ever had that experience you
can hate america you can be a you can be
a critic
you can complain all day long about
everything that's wrong with the country
we're designed to do that that's one of
the things that that's one of the things
that's good about america is that we
complain about everything
which makes us try to fix things so it's
a it's a positive thing
i have this great feeling about america
and i even tweeted about it it's like
wow really
really strong people and if these are
the people who are in charge
running the country i'm feeling pretty
good about it
well that didn't last that didn't last
so maisy arano gets up there and i'm
thinking
oh okay the kindest thing i can say is
you know chris coons
if you know what i mean you're no ben
sass
you're no amy coney barrett
whatever the hell that is you're doing
that just looks stupid
i'm sorry she just looks stupid
and she's embarrassing and when i see
her as a representative of the country i
think
that's not a good look i hope nobody's
watching this
and then um who's the other blumenthal
then blumethal goes i forget which order
they were in
and i'm listening to blumenthal and i'm
thinking
oh my god oh my god
all of those good feelings i had about
the competence of our leadership
evaporated and again i'm being very
careful
not to make this about democrat or
republican
they just happen to be two extra stupid
people
i don't know how the hell they got their
jobs really when
when you see like a josh a holly
or you see ben sass or you see chris
coons
you see amy you know coney barrett
you're seeing people operating at a
really high level
right really smart people and then you
see maisy
and then you see maisie arona and then
you see
dick blumenthal and you think how did
they get in there
how could they be in the same club you
know it just
doesn't it's mind-boggling and then
booker
cory booker now cory booker is someone
who
and i imagine this would be true of
verona and blumenthal as well
if any of these three people took an iq
test i imagine they do great
if any of them took in fact i think
booker was a
what kind of a scholar i mean he has he
has scholarly academic
credentials that are the highest level
so i'm sure that they
you know scholastically these are three
really accomplished people
don't want to take that away from them
but
they don't act capable in public
i don't know what's up with that and we
know that it's possible
because we just saw chris goons do it we
saw ben sasse do it
it can be done we know it can be done
but they can't do it for some reason now
it could be that they were the
designated
attack dogs so maybe they were they they
may have been assigned
the job of going hard so you know you
have
you have to be a little careful about
how much is their personality
and how much is them you know doing the
work of the party
uh the funnest the most fun story
the funnest story is that hunter biden's
laptop this is just the weirdest 2020
story
this is just so perfect nothing could be
more perfect
than this story except the next one
that'll happen tomorrow
because 2020 is just lit so
apparently uh sometime in the past
hunter biden had taken a laptop his own
laptop in for
service and he never picked it up
and so the owner of the repair shop
ended up figuring out whose it was and
giving it to
uh rudy giuliani
now as someone on twitter who was a
lawyer said
some legal advice if somebody leaves a
laptop at your
computer repair store don't give it to
rudy giuliani
that's probably not the most legal thing
anybody ever did
but it happened so not only is there
allegedly photos of hunter biden
uh smoking crack and having sex or
something i don't know i
i saw one picture that alleges to be him
asleep with a crack pipe still in his
mouth
i don't know if that's real or not but
uh that's the story
whether it's real or not and i guess
in there there's a email that
indicates that vice president biden when
he was vice president
did meet with a top executive of
uh the barista uh
company that hunter biden was working
for now keep in mind that joe biden had
said he
he didn't talk to hunter biden about
barisma and what hunter was doing in
ukraine
but now there's an email that indicates
that not only
did they probably talk but
but biden met with a high official of
burisma
and it's not looking good
you it's not looking good
um oh somebody's saying it's an
abandoned
work product in some states so
so there might be a state state law that
allows the
computer shop operator to do what he did
we don't know that
so i will revise my legal advice
because you should not take legal advice
from me
um
all right so
so that story i think is going to be
i think it will be a lot like the
unmasking story
i feel like the hunter biden thing is
going to be a whole bunch of things that
you're pretty sure
should result in some kind of legal
action but won't
or you're pretty sure it should change
the election but it won't
i feel as though the election is already
past
the point where something where a
revelation of this size will make any
difference
you know maybe six months ago this might
have made a little difference
but i don't know if it makes any
difference now
um apparently trump
said out loud and i don't i'm trying to
remember if he said this directly before
i think he might have
uh at his speech yesterday he said that
black lives matter
is a racist uh
and intends to cause division they're
racist and they
intend to cause division now of course
he says the black lives matter movement
as opposed to
the idea of black lives matter which as
far as i know nobody
nobody disagrees with the idea of it but
he's talking about the
organization and that they're racist and
that they intend
to cause division this is reason enough
to
reelect you know if you were looking for
one reason
like what's my one reason to vote for
trump
and i would say the fact that he would
call out black lives matter as being a
racist organization
or a racist movement as he put it i
think
that that's really brave
because you know what the right answer
is right everybody knows the right
answer is
you need to be fully on board with the
movement
but trump is willing to say what is
obvious to
most of us that it is a racist uh it is
racist
by its nature it doesn't even you don't
even have to get into the intentions of
the people involved
it is just by its nature racist because
it calls out
races for you know special consideration
so you could say that's right or wrong
but you can't say it's not racist
you might like it but it's still racist
and i think the president should call
that out so that i like that
and again nobody is arguing the point of
it
you know every everybody agrees black
lives matter that's not the point
so nielsen ratings are way down tv
rating for
not only the nba but things like
golf and horse racing so
it looks like there's some major shift
happening
or not i don't know you would think that
sports would be
more watched than ever because we don't
have as many forms of entertainment
right
if you don't have as many forms of
entertainment the ones that you do have
should get
more more business but
the the opposite is happening
and uh remind me to talk about kim
jong-un
i'm being prompted there and i'll do
that in a minute
um and i i wonder if
it's just because habits got broken i've
talked about the book
habit by charles dewing and it talks
about how you can program yourself into
habits
and one of the things i learned when i
was doing the dilbert tv
show for you know two half seasons back
in i don't know
years ago one of the things i learned is
that once you built an audience
in a time slot even if that audience
loved your show if you move it to a
different day or a different time you'll
you're going to lose
a big chunk of your audience now there
are cases where you'll gain audience
because you're moving to a better time
slot
but in general people are habit-based
and you mess with their habit
in any way and they'll lose the habit
and i think that watching television
just watching television in general was
a habit
most of us had and then we lost it
because there was nothing on tv worth
watching except the news
and you could watch the news and you
know on your phone etc
so i think that one of the biggest
under-appreciated effects of the
pandemic is that it broke our habits
and once your habits are broken then you
have to redesign your life
and it looks like people decided decided
consciously maybe
to redesign their lives without as much
tv
i feel like that's what happened and i
think that that would be a permanent
change um
so there's now evidence that uh both the
biden
and the trump rallies have spread
coronavirus
the the alleged uh biden part of that is
trivial
two people i guess or something at one
event but
uh the trump and that makes sense
because not many people are at a biden
event
but uh there are now 16 cases linked to
an outdoor trump event
at an airport uh september 18th
and and then some other one three people
from some other event in duluth or
something
so what do you make of that
does that tell you that we should not
have
mass events yes yes it does
it tells you exactly that it does if if
this data is correct
it does tell you or at least it's you
know more indication it's not a
scientifically uh you know locked down
point
but it's more indication that mass
gatherings
are you know a special problem for for
coronavirus
does that mean that the president
shouldn't do it well that's a different
calculation it's a different calculation
because we live in a world where people
take risks
suppose none of these 16 people
were hospitalized which is a good chance
and suppose that i imagine that they
also gave it to other people
and supposed that nobody was nobody was
hospitalized
i guess that's possible right so we
don't know that
but it's entirely possible that uh that
political rallies
have killed people would you agree
that that's possible there's no evidence
of it but just statistically
would you agree that we could conclude
now that
trump uh trump rallies had a pretty good
chance
i don't know what the odds are you know
i don't know if the odds are over
five percent or if they're over one
percent
but there's some chance that trump
rallies killed people
so what do you think about that
therefore was a big mistake
probably not because any time you get
you know ten thousand twenty thousand
thirty thousand people
changing what they're doing there's
gonna be
risk all right every every uh sporting
event has risk
every time you get your car has a risk
so the question is not whether these
caused infection i think everybody
thought there would be some
the question is whether it made sense
you know what was the benefit equal to
the cost
well if you think that the cost of trump
losing the election
the cost was socialism and the
destruction of the country
if you believe that would be the natural
progression well
then it's worth it if those events
got trump elected and that was the only
thing that prevented us from going full
socialist
and just you know destroying the country
yeah
totally worth it um and even if he
doesn't get elected
the risk you know the risk might still
look like it was worth it
it just didn't work out so
you know you could differ on the
question of whether it was worth it
but we now have pretty good indication
that it does cause
infections which shouldn't be a big
surprise right
webster's dictionary had a little rapid
change yesterday
did you see that story so when
maisie hirona senator rona
was i guess talking to barrett and
barrett had used the phrase sexual
preference
and hirono was
schooling her and telling her that no
it's sexual orientation
and the senator's point is that your
orientation is what you're born with and
that's
that's her view of the world that your
your sexuality is what you're
you're born with it's not something you
choose later it's like i think i'll be
gay
so that's what the senator says and
she says further that saying it's sexual
preference
is offensive and apparently uh
online webster's dictionary updated
their definition
to add that sexual preference is
offensive
in real time basically
i i think before the uh the hearings
were even over for the day
webster had changed its online
definition of the freaking word
does that scare you you should
they're changing the definition of a
word
to make it match the democrats preferred
narrative and it happened in real time
that's amazing
now it doesn't change much but here's
what i would add to it
how could you have a sexual preference
without the sexual orientation
first how does that happen how are they
different
now i i'm not the one who's going to
argue over which word you should use
because you know that's just i call that
word thinking you can't settle an
argument
by what word you choose to use on it
that's just talking about words it's not
talking about the the base
understanding but here's what i would
add
uh there's no such thing as a sexual
preference
that is disconnected from your sexual
orientation in other words the way
you're born
gives you all of your preferences right
why is it different i have a preference
for certain sports i have a preference
for certain foods
i have preferences for certain colors
pretty much all of them
i was born with i think because i you
know i had them when i was little
you know green was one of my favorite
colors when i was little
still one of my favorite colors you know
the the food i ate
for the most part you know you developed
some adult
food preferences but largely the same
stuff i liked when i was young
is the same stuff i would like now i'm
just a little better at staying away
from junk food that's it
um but i would add this to
the senator's understanding just just to
mess up the whole conversation
are you ready and
people can change their sexual
preference
that's it people can now
i believe that what i just said is
counter to
all science so let me put that out there
as far as i know science is very
solid on the fact that you're born with
your sexual orientation
and i believe that that's largely true
that you're born with a sexual
orientation
but i'll tell you as a hypnotist
i am well aware of situations
in which people have changed their
sexual preference
intentionally in other words they just
wanted to see if they could program
themselves
to have a different sexual preference
and they succeeded
and then they changed it back now you
could say well if you changed it back
it wasn't real but it was real when it
was happening
there were people who said i like this
kind of
activity and now i'm going to see if i
can intentionally program myself
to be a different person who likes a
different thing
and you can do it you can absolutely do
it
and i would argue that there are
probably lots of cases in the wild
where some charismatic and or
bad personality program somebody
to have a different preference
preferences
are are very programmable now you are
still born with a certain uh bias
so that's true you know the day you come
out of your
your mother or test tube or father or
whoever you come out of
in our in our amazing technological
world
but when you're born you do have really
strong
you know orientation and bias toward
things which which looks like a
preference later in life
but what science in general
said somebody in the comments is saying
that i'm lying
i'm not i'm not why would i lie about
that that would be a weird thing to lie
about wouldn't it
because i wouldn't be lying to make
money i wouldn't be lying to make a
i wouldn't be lying to be more popular
what would that lie by me exactly and
what would be the point of me telling a
lie on that point
you know i don't think there would be
any point to it
so anybody who
is born with a certain orientation and
nobody tries to influence it and they
don't try to change it
probably probably their preference and
their orientation become exactly the
same
but i'm just telling you that human
beings can be reprogrammed
way more than you think way
way way more than you think now i'm
uncertain
whether your life experience can change
those preferences
i would think so in extreme cases you
know
probably in extreme cases it could
change your preference
but i don't think it happens often i
wouldn't i wouldn't think that's even
anything to think about it probably is
just in the weirdest
case maybe somebody has a traumatic
experience
this involved their primary orientation
and maybe
they talk themselves into a different a
different preference over time
possible so if anybody is
new to my periscopes let me let me
remind you i am
the most pro lgbtq
person you've ever met in your life i am
left to bernie
here's what i mean uh
a conservative might say that they have
problems with
lgbtq people or problems with what
rights they have or something
right you can imagine there are people
on the right who's got problems with
that community
so i'm not in i'm not in that group then
you can imagine let's say bernie
sanders who would be a good example of
somebody who is the most
open you know the most the most uh
aggressively wants equal rights for the
lgbt
community now i'm left to that
in which i think bernie should suck a
dick because
i don't think it's enough that he's just
okay with it i think he needs to spend a
couple of weekends
living the life i'm just joking i'm just
joking
but the only way you could get left of
bernie would be to make it mandatory so
that's the joke
um but i am left of bernie on other
stuff such as drugs
bernie would legalize marijuana so would
i but i would go further i'd
legalize mushrooms maybe some other
stuff
and if you're over 80 i should i would
say you could do whatever drugs you want
because you're over 80. damn it do
whatever you want
so um and i'm quite serious when i say
i'm the most
pro lgbtq person you've ever met in your
life
more the better more the better
some of you might not love that position
but you'll get used to it
all right uh
let's see um so trump says he's going to
be in a
i guess he agreed to do a town hall on
nbc
and thursday night at the same time the
abc will have a town hall with uh joe
biden
is that just the best what could be
better
than nbc and abc having a
a town hall off against each other for
ratings
in which people will watch either biden
or they'll watch trump
who do you think is going to get better
ratings
you know no matter how much you like
biden you don't really expect him to get
good ratings do you
now i think a lot depends on what's the
lead-in show
and you know what what are the ratings
of cnn i'm sorry
what are the ratings of nbc and abc
already
so whichever one is starting with the
better ratings you know has an advantage
but that is going to be
fun the fun part will be switching back
and forth
and by the way how well how well do
nielsen and other ratings companies
or you know whatever you call them
can nielsen determine if you're
switching back and forth between
two pieces of content how would how
would they pick that up
do they do they measure the actual cable
box
so they know exactly how much time
you're spending i don't know how they do
that but that'll be fun to watch
all right let's talk about uh
oh it turns out that the new update
on kyle rittenhouse apparently
the gun he used is not going to be a
legal problem
so remember when all the news was about
he had
he illegally had a gun the cross state
lines or something like that
it turns out that no charges will be
there will be no charges related to the
gun it looks like at least in
this one county and i don't that still
means
he has to answer for the you know the
shooting itself
but it looks like he won't be charged
with a gun crime
which is new all right
all right let's talk about masks i will
go back to my
quiz all right reminding you
how would you do a lot of you've been
thinking about this quiz we'll see what
your answers are
85 percent of people who got covered
wore masks
therefore the logical conclusion is
if you were watching tucker carlson last
night you know that his conclusion was
masks don't work or if they do work they
don't work very well
because if 85 percent of the people who
wore a mask
got the virus anyway
what's that say about masks right mass
don't work
right wrong
wrong wrong wrong and wrong do you know
what this
conclusion should be almost
everybody wore a mask
that's the conclusion if
if everybody's wearing a mask which is
largely
true right if if i go out in public
pretty much every person has a mask they
can't go in a store within a mask
and people don't wear masks at home for
the most part
so really you're talking about going in
public and
i'll bet just about everybody wore a
mask
now does anybody believe that a mask is
designed
to eliminate coronavirus no
nope nobody believes that masks are
supposed to
eliminate all coronavirus everybody
understands
that whether masks work or masks
don't work in all cases whether they
work or don't
work people who wear them will get the
virus
you all agree with that right everybody
knows that wearing the mask is not a
hundred percent or even close to it
in terms of protection the only thing
you should get out of this
is that pretty much everybody in the
study was wearing a mask
and what would what would you know about
somebody who didn't wear a mask
well in all likelihood somebody who
didn't wear a mask
under these conditions probably was
somebody who knew they weren't around
dangerous situations in other words they
were in areas
where there wasn't much coronavirus to
begin with
in other words they were not in a hot
spot now maybe they should have worn
their mask more often
but they could easily get away with it
because there wasn't as much
virus so this kind of thing is so
freaking misleading to people who are
not
good at somebody says you are lying
lying about what what am i lying about
what a weird comment somebody told me
there's some
trolls who just come in and just say
stuff like that i'm guessing you're one
of those
all right i'm going to take it to the
next level
are you mad at me yet you will be
if you're not mad at me yet it's coming
here's the part where i lose about
two-thirds of my audience
and goes like this
so we all have to have a mass
strategy not just society but you
individually need to know
you know what are you going to do what
is your strategy
and let's say your sure masks work
or you mas you think mass might work but
you don't know
or on this extreme your sure masks don't
work
what would be the strategy you would
apply under each of those beliefs
well if you're sure masks work
you should wear a mask that's easy right
be sure they work wear a mask and
most medical professionals the vast
majority of medical professionals
are sure they work and they follow this
strategy
they wear a mask now that doesn't mean
they're right and it doesn't mean that
masks work in all situations
it just means that if they believe this
this is the right strategy that's
compatible with the belief
if you think masks might work but you're
not sure
yet you think there's some trade-off you
know but
but you think yeah they could work
given that it's temporary by its nature
now temporary might be
middle of next year but still temporary
what would be the right
strategy well if you're not sure
i would say you would wear a mask that
would be the better
strategy because you don't know if it
works it could be huge
you know if it's true that they make
some difference and let's say the
difference was
ten percent let's say the difference was
twenty percent
you know so it it mostly doesn't work
but there's a solid 10 20 difference
is it worth it probably because there
are so many lives at stake you're
talking
potentially millions of lives so this
would be the
most social thing you could do now let
me be clear
could this be a mistake could you say
well they might work and then you wear
them because that makes sense to you
and then later you find out studies come
out that was way worse to wear masks
that could happen totally right someday
there could be a study
this is the this is the ultimate final
study it's credible
it's controlled and it shows for sure
that man was that a big mistake back in
the pandemic
everybody who wore a mask they made it
worse
so that's possible so what should you do
probably still wear a mask because what
are the odds of that happening
nobody knows i would say not that high
probably somebody's going to have a
study like that but
may not be credible and then let's how
about this one let's say you're sure
masks don't work you're really sure they
don't work
what what is the strategy well it
doesn't matter you're irrational
because if you're sure they don't work
that's not based on data
why would you be sure of that most of
the professionals in the world
who know things about masks and are in
that world they're doctors they're
they're professionals far and away the
majority of them
think it probably works might be wrong
but that's all we know now you say
you're going to say to yourself but
scott scott scott
will you please look at this link i've
got on twitter
and it will clear you up you might
finally be informed
scott scotty scotty
you might finally be informed if you
follow my link and you can clearly see
from this story that masks have been
test
tested and they don't work just look at
this test
see right here and then i'll follow the
link and i'll look at it
and it won't be there meaning that there
is no
proof the masks don't work at the end of
that link
and so i'll say well anybody else got a
link and somebody else will come in
with the same amount of certainty
and they'll say scott you looked at the
wrong link
look at this link and look at this study
clearly shows it's a new study
so where it's an old study clearly shows
mass do not work so look at that so i go
open the link
and i look at it and there's nothing
like that there
in fact the the actual study says
and this is the important part we can't
really study this
the way it should be studied because it
would be unethical
in other words it would be unethical to
send half of your doctors
into the hot spot without masks
even if those doctors even if those
doctors said we volunteer
look we need to know the answer we
volunteer we we know the risk
and we won't wear masks it's still
unethical
because there's such um there's such a
strong
belief that it probably makes a
difference even if it doesn't
that you can't put together a study that
would have a control base
or a control group if you don't have a
study with a control group
you don't know anything because if we've
learned nothing
it's that every study that doesn't have
a control group is just garbage
sometimes they're right sometimes
they're wrong
but i think it's by accident or chance
or something but you can't depend on it
all right so everybody who thinks
they're sure mass don't work you're in
the irrational group
could you be right yes
yes let me say that as many times as you
need to hear it
could this be group end up you know
someday in the future could we find out
that they nailed it and they were right
yes but there is no evidence of that at
the moment
and it would be irrational to act on
something that has zero evidence
when the stakes are this high okay
that should take care of 40 of my
audience right there
all right so i know a lot of you are
getting really mad right now and you're
having the same
experience that the left does when i
point out
that the fine people hoax is a hoax
and all you have to do is go read the
transcript and you can see for yourself
what happens when i point that out do
they ever do this
oh really there's more to the story let
me look at it oh follow that link
yeah oh my my goodness i never saw this
second part of the quote
it is a hoax yes once you read the
second part it's obvious it's a hoax
do they ever do that no
no not one time do you see anybody do
that
but is that different than this all of
you who are
anti-mask all of the alex berenson
followers etc all of you who are sure
that the mass doesn't work are having a
fine people hoax experience right now in
other words cognitive dissonance
is making you a little bit angry at me
and one of the things that will happen
is you're not going to be able to hear
me right in other words
you will reinterpret what you just heard
and saw
into something different and then you
will angrily send me a tweet after i'm
done here
that will show you don't understand what
i said but you're really mad at your
misunderstanding of what i said
that's going to happen it's probably
already happening if i
if i were to open my twitter right now
you probably already see the cognitive
dissonance
all right so
this is one of those tests where you can
say i keep laughing at those fine people
hoax people with cognitive dissonance
but is it happening to me right now
and it might be oh thanks for the
reminder kim jong-un
i did see finally uh maybe yesterday a
video of kim jong-un
on talking and on video
and it looks to be a current one so my
my current revised updated conspiracy
theory
which was just for fun i told you at the
time is that he does seem to be alive
so good for kim jong-un
and i'm kind of glad because the last
thing we want is uncertainty
and one thing he does bring is at least
a little bit more certainty
and he he does seem to uh he does seem
to like it
or he does seem to like the president
all right um
let's see i'm just going to look at some
of your comments here
see how we did hypnosis somebody's
asking me well you need more of a
question than just the word hypnosis
with a question mark
oh somebody's asking about peanut
allergy is it the
the peanut allergic person who has the
responsibility or is it the
rest of society who is not allergic to
peanuts who has a
responsibility to keep it away i'm not
sure that works as an analogy to masks
so i'm not going to
go there
oh msnbc if you're joining late uh that
got bumped
uh because of the coney barrett hearings
so that will be rescheduled for another
time
um
somebody says that i'm correct
uh oh so there's a doctor who's watching
right now
who says that my mask analysis is
correct
thank you mask transcript
no there's no mask transcript
mask help prevent blah blah blah we
don't
well i'm not going to talk more about
masks i've said i've said all i need to
say
about masks so
this is one of those loser thing
situations
where i talk about your talent stack
being important to being able to analyze
situations my guess is that there's
nobody
with an economics degree or very few
who would have had a different opinion
than i do about masks
so let me put that out there as a
challenge to you
my challenge is that anybody who had the
sufficient
training to know how to compare things
and i would say
we'll use economists as our as our
measurement
an economist would know how to compare
things and i would guess that most of
them would agree
with what i just said um
i had the experience yesterday as i went
into a store and i
just forgot my mask and i didn't realize
that i wasn't wearing it until i got all
the way up to
to pay and i felt like a lot you know i
felt like
uh you know patient zero or something
i've
never felt more uneasy in a store
knowing that the other people are like
oh he's going to kill us
what about mathematicians mathematicians
are not
trained to compare things the way
economists are trained to compare things
that would be a different skill
all right um yes and vitamin d
apparently there is a real
there will be a controlled vitamin d
test for coronavirus
so that's just being organized now so i
don't know how long that will take
maybe three months or so we'll we'll
know if
vitamin d is the big deal we thought it
was
um
the zelenko protocol you haven't heard
much about that
lately have you somebody's uh prompted
me in the in the comments
so i i'm blocking people on
twitter when they say so scott where's
your hydroxychloroquine
well you you've been pumping that
hydroxychloroquine scott
no i haven't no i've been doing the
opposite
i've been telling you that every day
that goes by
and i believe i've been saying this
probably since march
i said that every day that goes by where
we're not
we're not sure that hydroxychloroquine
works
probably tells you it doesn't so
having now gotten all the way into
october
without any conclusive you know real
solid solid hydroxychloroquine results
the kind that would cause everybody to
start using it
in other words if you hear that all the
major hospitals
are just using that as their go-to maybe
not hospitals but doctors they'll say
then i'd say okay well they've looked at
all the evidence they've seen the
results
it works but my guess is that there is
less
hydroxychloroquine being prescribed
today
than there was in may how
does anybody want to take that bet
anybody want to take the bet
that the people who are most qualified
the doctors the researchers
the people who are most qualified to
determine even though we don't have
perfect information yet
but the ones who are in the best shape
to know what studies are telling you
something that's useful
i'll bet there's less of it prescribed
so my last update was that i think i'd
uh put it down to a 30 chance at most
the hydroxychloroquine is some kind of a
game changer or it makes a difference
i think i would lower that again so i
think i'll lower that again to
twenty percent so i'd say there's no
more than a twenty percent chance of
maybe ten percent
maybe less that hydroxychloroquine will
be the answer
now i think that's that was a sensible
way to go
early indications were so strong
that optimism was you know it was
warranted but the further we went
without confirming it
because if the signal was as strong as
the lenko said
zelenko's claim is that basically it
eliminates the problem
if that were true surely there would be
enough other people who were trying it
in the same way
and they would be reporting the same
thing and it would just be so confirmed
there would be no doubt about it
i think at this point we have to assume
that the odds of hydroxychloroquine
being a big deal
maybe 10 i think i'll i think i'll put
it at 10
again it's not impossible that the
entire thing was a
you know a big mind effort and
and really it worked the whole time it's
possible i just say the odds the odds
just keep plunging
every day that goes by without
confirming it
i will offer your bet somebody wants to
make me a bet on it
i don't know how you would prove the bet
because we don't believe any studies
these days
somebody says the fine people hoax is
the best analogy for hydroxychloroquine
is it is it i don't know
i i don't like analogies for trying to
understand the world
they're good for explaining something
the first time that's the only thing
they're good for
uh do i read the posts on locals i do
yes
now i can't read every single thing that
people send me so at this point
i'm getting messages from you know
linkedin email
text you know various apps
on locals on twitter etc
so i get far more messages than i can
read them all but i
i put more effort into reading the
messages on locals
because those are subscribers um
did you hear trump on who is it the
johnson johnson
thing oh one person got sick so they
they postponed
or they put it on hold um yeah
i don't know if we can tell anything
from the johnson johnson trial
because it's not unusual that one person
has a weird
illness and it might not be related to
the vaccine
but it's just good form to pause things
until they can find out
so i don't know that we know anything
that's kind of standard procedure
somebody says masks equals slavery
well okay
somebody says they're pro mask but their
anti-mask
mandate i feel you could make that
argument
i'm not sure that a mandate makes any
difference does it
oh let me give you an update on
california most of you know california
has been mocked
because the the state updated its mask
guidance to say that you should wear
your mask between
bites at a restaurant literally the
guidance in california
is you have to lift your mask take a
bite
and then put your mask down while you're
chew and that's how you will enjoy your
restaurant meal
well so i went out to eat last night
and my observation is that exactly
zero people in my town are obeying that
california regulation and i like that
uh you know i would be disappointed if
my town didn't use
you know masks because that that feels
reasonable enough as i've
explained but the mask the part where
you can eat in a restaurant but you have
to have your mask on
unless you're putting the food in your
mouth i think everyone in california
as one looked at that and said
nope nope you know
you always know when you've gone too far
when a hundred percent of the public
just says
nope at exactly the same time i would be
willing to bet
that i will never see a single person
wearing their mask and only taking it
off to bite and then putting it back on
i'll bet i'll never see
even one person do that and you know
what
every person in the restaurant i was in
last night
probably would have accepted uh being
arrested
to not have to comply with that you know
i don't obviously i'm not a mind reader
i i don't know what other people are
thinking but my sense of it was
that you would have to put me in you'd
have to put the the chains on me
you'd have to drag me to jail to get me
to wear my mask
in between bites all right the there is
such a thing as too far
and that is so unambiguously
clearly too far nobody's going to do
that
so california if you're smart you'll
rescind that
because it makes you look like freaking
idiots it just makes you look like
idiots
nobody's gonna comply with that nobody
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you
tomorrow
