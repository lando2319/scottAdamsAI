well i understand it takes about 10
seconds for the
youtube feed
to kick in
so i don't want you to miss anything
because today
well let me tell you today is one of the
best days ever
at least
you made it to coffee with scott adams
and that is a strong strong start
and what is this the best thing of all
time the best thing in the universe the
multiverse
and possibly every simulation
to infinity
and how do you make it even better
um yeah you uh you just need a couple of
marker glasses thank you chelsea canty
drunk flash fest of any kind philly's
favorite liquid i like coffee
science has now proven that the
simultaneous sip will boost your immune
response
oh it will it's gonna happen right now
are you ready go
oh yeah
i feel even the vaccination is being
destroyed by this coffee not just the
carotid virus the vaccination itself
yeah that's how powerful coffee is
well
let's talk about all the fake news i
like to start with the fake news first
we got fake news from cnn and a little
more fake news from fox news let's see
who's the fakest
cnn has the following headline
texas school administrator
told teachers to include holocaust books
with quote opposing views
when explaining the new state law
what
that's the headline
there's some school
where the administrator said you know
you're going to need a
second opinion on this whole holocaust
situation
now does that sound like real news
do you think this really happened it's a
headline it's on cnn
do you think it really happened
sort of
sort of
but in a fake news way it happened
here's what actually happened
the administrator was discussing that
you always have to have books on
both points of every issue
that's it
that's the story
that the story is you need books that
represent both sides of every issue
then somebody said well what about the
holocaust
and the administrator
had to explain the policy
and the policy is
you need an opposing view of the
holocaust
now
uh you know there's there's a uh there's
some one issue which is how did he
answer the question right there was
somebody who just answered the question
and i think he answers the question by
saying they don't allow exceptions
it's not really his fault
that the way the headline the headline
is writing it like there's a school
administrator who who's not so sure
about the holocaust
that's not happening it's just somebody
who didn't know how to explain to people
that there weren't any exceptions you
have to have the opposing view
now
i would argue that the holocaust is one
thing there are probably a few others in
which
an opposing view cannot be expressed
and shouldn't be
probably
because it's a psychological pillar of
the you know israeli nation
very important to
you know jewish people and jewish
supporters all over the world
and i would say that the
the narrative of the holocaust exactly
the way it is
has a use that goes beyond information
and knowledge
it becomes almost a physical asset
because it protects israel i mean it's
part of their defense
so i don't think that you should
necessarily
uh question something that has turned
from an idea into a physical reality
if that physical reality is keeping
people safe
i mean
i'm not sure you can
treat an idea the same as a physical
reality
from an idea
now it's dangerous it's dangerous to
have something you can't question when
just generally speaking but
you know just in the same word that the
same way i would argue that
we should all have free speech
i would argue with that
right we should all have free speech
no argument
but do i think you should say the n word
if you're not black
no
no
because that word isn't like other words
to imagine that every word is like every
other word
is just not realistic right that word
has translated into the physical world
right it's
it's so palpable it's
it's not even really a word or a concept
anymore it's more like a physical object
um you know i'm being a little
hyperbolic here but you can't treat all
the words the same that's not the real
world
anyway
so that's cnn's fake news uh trying to
make it look like this texas
administrator was anti
or i don't know pro holocaust or
something
and it was just somebody trying to
explain a rule that didn't
didn't handle exceptions
how about fox news how they doing well
they ran a uh
an opinion piece by senator marco rubio
now keep in mind this is not seen this
is not fox news's opinion
but they put it on their their website
so whatever rubio says here they have to
take a little bit of
you know tangential responsibility
and this is what they say senator
senator rubio says he says for weeks
rumors have swirled in washington about
president joe biden's climates are
john kerry and his opposition to taking
concrete action against the chinese
communist party's use of slave labor
huh
so john kerry is not so he's not going
hard against china for their slave labor
and rubio goes on he says now we may
have an answer about his reluctance to
take action
according to a new report
kerry and his wife
have at least one million dollars
invested in a chinese investment group
called hill house and i guess they have
some
and then that group
has some connections to
some slave labor
but what kerry invested in was not the
company
that does the slave labor but rather a
group that invests in companies in
general
including at least one involved in slave
labor allegedly allegedly
now do i have to do a doctor evil
impression to tell you what's wrong with
this story
can can anybody do the impression in the
comments you know where i'm going right
the care
so i just
you know googled
the net worth of john kerry
it's 250 million dollars
he has a net worth of 250 million
dollars
do you think he cares about one million
dollars
that's one
250th of his net wealth
do you think he even knew
do you think he was even aware
that he had an investment
which would be tiny in his case
in a company that also had investments
in another company that was slave labor
i mean
you know you could argue he should have
zero money in china and i would argue
that too he should have zero money in
china but
a million dollars
you think john kerry's gonna
throw the united states under the bus
for a million dollars because he's a
democrat you don't like him
i don't think so i mean he might be
throwing the united states under the bus
he might be making bad decisions that's
a separate question
i'm just saying
if you think that a guy with 250 million
dollars is making
like decisions about the world
because of the fate of his one million
dollars
that he could move anytime he wants
he's not
that's fake news
there's no way that's that's influencing
his decisions
i'm not defending kerry
right you know i do not think the biden
administration is exactly nailing it
when it comes to
when it comes to china so i'm a critic
of how they handle china but this
criticism
doesn't make sense this is a criticism
you could only make if you've never been
rich
let me be blunt
i'm not even sure i would be influenced
by a million dollar investment
right and i don't have 250 million
dollars
so
i don't think this is fair
uh glenn says you're completely wrong
i'm sorry
i
well now i'm thrown
i had this argument i thought it made
sense
i was just looking at the numbers and
using my own personal experience
but now glenn says i'm wrong
well now i'm rethinking everything
glenn you have thrown me for a loop
here i thought i was making a little bit
of sense but glenn comes in
nope
you're wrong
wow
i'm just gonna quit
give up i give up
glenn
glenn qed you win
well the hashtag bear shelves biden is
going around
apparently
uh
somebody paged
bearish elves biden at an airport
there's a there's a video of
the page
paging bear shells biden bare shells
biden
that's pretty funny
here's my problem
with
trump's current approach to running for
reelection one assumes
and it goes like this
what would trump have to do to win
re-election
just show up and be quiet right
just show up
don't make any trouble and just say
look at look at what i did
on the border look what i did in various
places and then just compare it
if you want more of what i did vote for
me
if you want more of what uh biden's
giving you vote for him
i don't know how he could lose
right how could he possibly lose but on
the other hand
asking trump to not be trump
is that fair
is it realistic
yeah i don't think there's any chance
he's going to change his technique
but the technique that was
100 percent right
for the first election
i think is 100 wrong for the second one
what do you think
because the the being provocative and
being you know
you know more extreme than even his base
really worked on the first
election but now we look at
you know we can look at his track record
as a president which is completely
different right
when he was running for president he
didn't have any track record and he was
a newbie to politics in a sense but now
he has a track record
just compare it
just compare your statistics to biden
and say what do you think
that's all he has to do
to win i think
i mean he has to be interesting and you
know have good opinions and stuff not
make mistakes but you can do all that
now i guess i'm wasting my breath
because you know trump's going to be
trump and i'm not even sure you'd want
that to change would you
i mean
i always feel silly
giving advice to somebody who's more
successful
doesn't sound like a little bit absurd
like if i could have run for president
and you know gotten gotten the job like
trump did well maybe i should give him
some advice but i didn't make it all the
way to the presidency
i didn't try but i imagine i wouldn't
have succeeded
he did
so it always feels a little uh
i don't know arrogant or something to
give advice to somebody who clearly
knows how to do stuff better than you do
at least better than i do
but at this point it does look like a
gigantic glaring mistake
we'll see if we'll see if that changes
um
so a report from an icu doctor
that said it was statistically
impossible for this doctor to see in the
icu what the doctor is saying
i think i believe it was a woman who was
saying that
um there's just a whole bunch of people
coming in with
vaccination related side effects like
really bad ones you know devastatingly
life-changing bad effects
now
the doctor says
how is it possible statistically
that if the vaccinations are as safe as
you say
how how is it possible
that my icu is seeing all these damaged
people after vaccinations
so the doctor makes the case
that statistics shamistics
mystics
if one doctor is seeing all these
problems it is statistically impossible
for it to be coincidence what do you
think
what do you think
statistically impossible
that one doctor could see all these
vaccination related injuries
anybody
coincidence
well that would be a pretty big
coincidence says the doctor
what what nobody's nobody's going to
agree with the doctor
this is a doctor personal experience
it matters
all right you're all too smart
you're all too smart
yes
in a situation in which you have many
many hospitals and many many icus and
many many people getting vaccinated
what are the odds that what are the odds
that at least one
of the icus
will get a whole bunch of people
that seem to have
vaccinations bad side effects what are
the odds that one icu would have that
thank you
the odds are exactly 100
there's a 100 chance
that at least one icu would have this
experience now what would be the odds
that the doctors in the icu
who experience this this very odd thing
that's 100 likely to happen to somebody
what are the odds that they would think
it was a coincidence
go ahead what are the odds that the
doctors themselves
would think they were experiencing a
coincidence
when they get all these people coming in
with vaccination related
side effects
almost 100 chance they would think there
was something going on
because they're dumb
because they
are not good at statistics no
no
they should feel exactly the way they do
feel which is i imagine i can't read
their minds but i imagine if you had
that experience you'd say whoa red flag
i'd better tell people
is that the right decision
oh red flag i better tell everybody yes
yes
if you're in the icu and you see person
after person with with huge problems for
one cause
yes go public right away
but just remember
there's a hundred percent chance this
had to happen by coincidence
there's a hundred percent chance
that some icu would have a weird outcome
and they'd want you to know and they
should
they should
we're going to talk about ferris in a
moment
so uh
so there's that at the same time
um
i saw a doctor yes dr
j
uh batacaria
said there's a lot to learn from this
graph and he showed a graph that i think
a lot of people with vaccinations are
still getting infected
so he says what is the argument for
mandates
if people who are getting vaccinated
are still getting infected this doctor
says so what's what's the point for
mandates
if you're still getting infected
does that question even make sense
how does that question make sense
the question doesn't even make sense
what does mandates have to do with this
the mandate is
is disconnected from this question it's
just a separate question
all right
so a number of people have told me that
the government has quote moved the
goalposts on vaccinations how many of
you think that the government has moved
the goalposts
first they told you oh these
vaccinations will stop you from getting
infected and then it turned into whoa uh
maybe maybe there will stop you from
getting infected maybe it just stops you
from getting from dying
so did they move the goalposts
i'm seeing lots of yeses but some no's
that's not moving the goal post
i mean they said
the goal
is to vaccinate you so you don't get the
vaccination but now it's not
it's a different goal
have they not moved the goal post
yeah i'm saying less yes they moved the
goal post
no they didn't
how did you let me how did you let me
goad you into agreeing to that
nobody moved any goal posts
the data changed
the data changed
what we thought we knew
turned out to be wrong
so when the new data came in
did they move the goal post or did they
revise their plan
as any reasonable person should
when they have new data
that's not moving the goal post that's
just
adjusting to the fog of war and you had
a plan it didn't work out
you've heard the saying that a battle
plan only lasts until the first bullet
is fired
and then it's chaos and then you've got
to improvise
i want my government to improvise
don't you
what what did you want them to do get
new information and then just do the
same thing they were doing when they
knew it wouldn't be effective
that they they couldn't do the first
thing
what did you want them to do
i want them to change to change the plan
which they did
why are you complaining about that
why would you complain
about them changing the plan to
something more reasonable
once they have better data
why are we bitching about that
it's exactly what you want all right
here's another mind blower
you ready for this
what would be the best case scenario
for how to you know manage the pandemic
and get to the other side
uh given that we know
vaccinations don't completely stop it
and it's going to be around for a while
what's the best case scenario
i would argue that the best case
scenario
is the one we're in
exactly the one we're in
precisely exactly the one we're in
is the best case scenario because the
best case scenario given
what we have to work with right it's not
a perfect world but what we have to work
with are vaccinations and therapeutics
that can greatly reduce the risk of
serious problems and death but we know
if you wait around long enough pretty
much everybody's going to get it whether
they're vaccinated or not probably
or even if they've been infected before
apparently you can get it again
so
if we know we're all going to get it
isn't the best case scenario
that we get vaccinated so it doesn't
kill us
and
and we just you know build immunity you
know the humans build immunity over time
just by being infected
somebody says stop calling them vaccines
that's word thinking
word thinking
so whether i called a vaccine or not
we are all under the same understanding
that it doesn't
completely stop
the spread would it matter if i changed
the word
how would you be happier if i changed
the word given that everybody knows what
it means
that in this case
the vaccine is more like a
prophylactic
therapy we all know it right so now that
we all know it
the word is okay
i would argue that when we first were
finding out that the vaccines were you
know leaky or they
they wouldn't stop infections
when it first came out we should have
been real careful about using the word
vaccine
but now you all know what it means
so now we can use the word you all know
it's not perfect
so yes it's different than other
vaccines but
we know what it means so the word's fine
all right um
we're all brainwashed now well somebody
says there might be some legal
definitional thing that's a separate
question
um
yeah you could call it a shot
but let's let's not care about what we
call it okay
all right let's talk about uh
uh
let's talk about
the joe rogan versus sanjay gupta
and it's fascinating to me that this
continues to be
big news
i mean i'm very interested in it so i
love this story so so i guess i'm happy
uh but what you saw after the joe rogan
versus sanjay gupta
interview is you saw something very much
like when
sam harris had me on his podcast
in i don't know
20 whatever
um talking about trump
and i went on sam harris's broadcast i
thought i did well presenting my
argument
and
the people i talked to said wow you just
you slayed him
you just demolished sam harris on his
own show
good job you just
made him look like a clown
and then i'd check online
and i would see the people who follow
sam harris more than they are interested
in me
and they said
man sam harris just destroyed you in
that interview
and they were equally certain
that they had watched something in which
i had been dismantled
whereas the people who were more likely
to like me before that
thought i dismantled him
which really happened
i don't know
i don't know apparently they're just two
movies and they're both complete
i live in one of them
but i can't tell you the other movie's
wrong
i don't know i just know i'm in one of
the other movies i'm just not in i'm not
in the other one
i can't see that movie
so with the rogan versus sanjay gupta we
had almost exactly the same thing
we had i'm seeing lots of people say oh
man
joe rogan demolished sanjay gupta he
just ripped him apart that was great he
just
sanjay didn't have anything he could say
in response
i didn't see that movie
what movie was that in
what movie did you see where joe rogan
destroyed sanjay gupta
did any of you see that
was that the movie you saw because i
didn't see it
i'm seeing a yes
um sanjay hedged
so i'm just just looking to say
um
all right so somebody's on to the right
answer what i saw
was joe rogan eviscerating cnn as a
network for lying
that's what i saw what did that have to
do with sanjay gupta
i i didn't see rogan ever
say that sanjay gupta called the horse
horse medicine
you know
dr gupta never called it horse medicine
i don't think he's not been accused of
it
so when
uh sanjay was sort of uh put on the spot
to defend cnn
did he do it
no
he didn't
i think my respect for
dr gupta you know went up to another
level i already liked him
but i think he went up to another level
because he didn't defend the network
he just didn't address it directly
because it wasn't his problem
it was his employer's problem it wasn't
his he didn't need to he didn't need to
defend some problem he didn't cause
so he didn't defend it
um and let joe rogan's criticism stand
and that was exactly the right thing to
do i think that was ethically and
communication wise and on every other
dimension i think sanjay gupta handled
that criticism of the network
just right
just right but
when they started talking about medicine
um i'm sorry but sanjay gupta showed
that joe had some big big holes
in his understanding of the odds
of you know what's the relative risk of
one thing versus the other and and the
fact that you can get reinfected if you
have
uh natural immunity too there were some
other things that rogan didn't
understand at the level that
sanjay gupta did statistically not even
medically just about the statistics of
things
so what i saw was sanjay gupta
eviscerating joe rogan
on the top deck that sanjay was there to
talk about
but yes joe rogan eviscerated
sanjay gupta's network
but i don't think that was ever a debate
i think sanjay just let that stand as he
should
as he should have
you know if he's being objective at all
he's just going to let that stand
all right so that was my take two movies
the let's talk about the vares database
here's something that a lot of you
didn't know
number one
the vers database is not a database of
verified vaccination
side effects
it is a database where people report
i think
this may have been caused by
the vaccination
all right
seeing somebody sign off don't sign off
until you see the point
how come you wouldn't want to know the
point
[Laughter]
so the people who sign off before i
finish the verse conversation
that is cognitive dissonance
because they can't handle the fact that
they have a pretty strong opinion and
they've watched me long enough to know
that there's a pretty good chance i'm
going to dismantle it in the next
30 seconds and people are like no
no i have an opinion don't dismantle it
too weak
can't handle it too weak to hear a
competing opinion
don't be weak
don't be weak hang in here you can
handle this
all right so the varus database is just
what people report it's not what's true
but in the context of a pandemic
what would you expect
about the reports
so the vera's database you know chugs
along
gets a few reports you know hardly the
public has barely even heard of it
so get some reports but then the
pandemic comes along and whoa
everybody gets vaccinated and suddenly
wow lots of reports
what's that tell you
does it tell you that the vaccinations
are therefore causing lots of problems
because there are lots lots
like way lots
of reports on theirs
this is where you report the problems
and it's like off the chart
so what does that tell you
does it tell you that there are
probably
a lot of problems with the vaccination
is that how you interpret that
i'm watching the people on locals
commenting and
uh there they might be a little bit more
um
maybe more trained
about how to look at these things than
than the people coming in from youtube
who haven't been exposed to this kind of
analysis
here's here's what the vares database is
measuring
mass hysteria
the varus database is not a database
of how many people had vaccination
side effects
it's not
it is a database that tries to be one
where you report them without
verification
but what it morphed into during the
pandemic and so what it is at the moment
and later it will you know probably not
be that but at the moment
it is only a database
for capturing mass hysteria
because there are so many people
vaccinated and in a big country lots of
people have just medical problems that
they don't know where they came from
people say wait a minute
i just got a lump
and last week i got vaccinated
put it in the various database
does everybody get that that the varus
database is only measuring
mass hysteria
people worried that whatever problem
they had came from the vaccination
now i want to say this as clearly as
possible i don't know if the
vaccinations
are hurting more people than we think
i don't know how would i know i just
know that you can't tell anything by
looking at the varus database
in a pandemic
in which everybody's talking about it
because as soon as everybody's talking
about the varis database and like the
average person on on twitter knows
exactly what it is
you didn't know that two years ago did
you
two years ago had you ever heard of the
vares database
no
that's why not many things are reported
to it
because you've never even heard of it
but now everybody knows about it
so if you have if you have a sniffle
two weeks after getting the vaccination
you're thinking
maybe i should put that in the varis
database maybe
all right
so learn to tell evac a massive stereo
from data you'll be in better shape
here's the podcast i want to see
and therefore never will i'd like to see
dr sanjay gupta speaking with alex
berenson
who was de-platformed on twitter
and other places i think
because he made many claims that the
experts said
are a little too provocative and outside
of
science
um
well i'm that's my own judgment i i
actually i i shouldn't give my own
opinion of why he was de-platformed
so just say he was he was de-platformed
for his
pandemic related opinions
and data
um i would love to see sanjay gupta talk
to alex berenson but
i wanted to be moderated by or or
fact-checked in real time by andres
andres backhouse i mention him all the
time on my live stream so in my
experience he's the most productive
thinker
when it comes to looking at data he's
got a phd in economics
and it's sort of his thing
so when whenever i get a here hey here's
this study
and i'm i think i don't know should i
believe that study
i always shoot it over to him
uh
about half the time he comes back with
uh
this study is garbage and here's the
reason
and he's almost always right
as far as i can tell i mean i'm not the
one who can judge it but it seems like
it
so he usually gets the last word on a
lot of these things
now
let me ask you this have you ever seen
that kind of setup for a podcast
because i haven't
usually what you see is an expert a
sanjay gupta
talking to a regular person who's the
host of the podcast
let's say joe rogan
how much can you learn
when one expert talks to a non-expert on
a podcast
nothing
nothing
that model
just doesn't get you there
in fact i just told you people watched
that model and came away with completely
different movies
completely different movies
you have to you have to put together a
show that at least has a chance of
producing one primary movie in other
words one interpretation of what
happened and i think you could get there
if you had two people who know what
they're talking about
in this case alex berenson's he's not a
medical doctor but he's one of the most
famous critics and he's done a super
deep dive
on his position
i'd like to see his super deep
non-doctor take
balanced against you know dr sanjay
gupta or somebody of you know similar
credibility but i think you know gupta
has got the
communication skills on top of the
knowledge you know it could be a doctor
drew
um but somebody somebody who has
communication skills on top of
medical expertise
and then have it moderated by somebody
who does fact checking in real time
because most of these conversations are
going to be
alex claims x study tells them something
right and then you need andres to sit
there and say wait
that study has the following problems
and then you can evaluate you know how
much weight to put on that
so
that's the podcast i want to see
um
i saw an opinion today uh was it an epi
epoch epoch times
good publication you should be following
epoc i never know how to say that word
e-p-o-c-h
tell me how to pronounce that
epoch
epoch
or
ebook
epic
you're not all agreeing you know what
the word is
all right
um and they had a report that
an owner operated independent truck
drivers association
warns that part of the problem i don't
know how big this is in relation to the
whole problem
is
the required drug and alcohol testing
for truck drivers
is quote a challenge for them
yes the drug and alcohol testing for
truck drivers is a challenge
you know who else is a challenge for
everybody basically there aren't too
many people who aren't on drugs or
alcohol but i guess the testing itself
is probably
you know takes time out of their
effectiveness so it might be that they
don't want to get into a profession in
which they would be tested
that's probably going to limit the
number of people
um it's time to get the amish
driving trucks
no i know i know the amish don't like
their modern technology but they also
don't do a lot of drugs or alcohol
if we could just
just get the amish to
be a little bit flexible on the vehicle
part
or how about your mormons
let's get some mormon truck drivers in
there you know the ones who actually
don't drink and don't do drugs
and i wonder if you could pay more if
you had somebody who was guaranteed to
be alcohol and drug free
i feel like you could pay them more
couldn't you
because it seems like your insurance
costs would be lower if there was some
way you could demonstrate that you only
hired people who are free of drugs and
alcohol
so maybe you could pass that
along to the drivers get a bunch of
non-drug drivers double their income
maybe you get enough
robot truck drivers yeah that's the
future but it's going to take a while
for
the tesla
robot-driven trucks eventually i think
all transportation is going to be
automated trucks right
wouldn't you expect that to be all
transportation eventually
i also wonder if we should build a uh
like a a truck-only
series of highways
where you know only trucks can be on it
and and you know just crisscrosses the
main part of the country and gets you
close to everything
because i feel like if you had a truck
only road and there were automated
trucks
that you could really
dr john
i i saw i saw an idiot
on the comments
and i thought who is this is dr johnson
again
dr johnson i don't believe you're a
doctor
you seem to be a troll
but we'll put you in
we'll hide you on this channel you're
hidden dr johnson
he's the guy who comes on and no matter
what i say he says i'm
shilling for vaccinations
no matter how many times i tell you
i don't care if you give accidents i
mean i genuinely don't care
you know most people think that
i get accused of being afraid
scott you're just afraid because you're
personal risk
that's why you're trying to talk
everybody else into getting vaccinated
number one
not trying to talk anybody into getting
vaccinated
number two
afraid of what
are isn't everybody afraid of something
you're either afraid of the vaccination
itself or you're afraid of the covet so
you get the vaccination
is there anybody who was making
decisions free of fear
i mean it might be a statistical fear
where you don't feel it in your bones
but you're trying to minimize your risk
right
so do i do i feel fear from covid
not vaccinated
i'm not sure i felt a giant risk before
but i definitely felt it before but once
vaccinated
and i can't tell you that that's
rational
because fear is irrational right usually
um
so i just tell you i feel i don't feel
anything that i could recognize as a
fear of the virus
do any of you have that fear
how many
actually i'd be interested to see this
tell me in the comments
which one scares you the most
if you're scared at all
is anybody afraid of the shot or afraid
of the virus itself
most people are going to say they're not
afraid that's what it looks like so far
not afraid no fear no fear
yeah
i do think some people have some fear
but
i don't think it's a big
big part of the decision making frankly
all right
uh i fear the vaccination somebody says
but
i think it's all it's all fear-based
all right
that
was my prepared
set of notes i saw also that uh
bannon it looks like he's resisting the
subpoena or something
to testify in front of congress to which
i say
why does congress even have that power
shouldn't testifying just be a a legal
thing like if you have legal problems
why should you be forced to testify to
congress
i'm not sure that even sounds like a
free country does it
now i guess people are not really
penalized or they don't get jailed for
refusing subpoenas to congress so we'll
see if bannon does
but i hope he doesn't
i hope he testifies
because i can't imagine anything that
would be more entertaining
than seeing
bannon
you know having the stage in that
setting
that would be
fun to watch
so
let's hope that happens
all right what else is happening is
there any uh stories i missed today
uh oh mccabe i guess he got his pension
back
you know i don't mind that
i don't mind that so for some reason
i hate it extra that people lose
pensions
that never feels like the right penalty
to me like i get you know getting fired
i get
i get going to jail if you did something
that bad but losing a pension feels like
taking something from you that you
earned
and mccabe earned his pension
i don't see it just doesn't feel like
justice
you know no matter what you think you
did
it doesn't feel like justice to lose a
pension
i mean or or you'd have to do something
a lot worse i suppose
i don't know
can you please help end the mandates
um
why
no i i'm opposed to mandates so you
don't have to convince me why why i want
them to go away
but why would you want me to do it
does that seem fair
because you know i told you that i've
tried to not persuade on
on some of this stuff because it's
unethical
the problem is i'm too persuasive
and
i'd have to be really sure i'm right or
it has to be non-medical you know so
there's low
low risk
but i have to be really sure i was right
to persuade people to do something
medical
and i think even the mandates have
basically are a medical decision in a
sense
uh can you persuade everyone to be
happier and healthier yes
it's called the simultaneous sip and and
all that comes with it
how many of you feel that i've made you
happier
in the comments
yeah now on youtube you're not seeing
this but over on the locals it's a
subscription see it's just a sea of
yeses
it's just it's all yeses
it just lit up
the the comments just lit up with yeses
now you're now you're a little bit
behind but they're all yeses
right so somebody asked me if i could
make you happier
and
apparently i can
apparently i can now not every person
kristen says my uh epistemology is
flawed
oh man
i was having a good day
but it turns out my apisto epistemology
is flawed
alexa what's an epistemology
investigates the limits and nature of
human knowledge
i guess mine's flawed
so
good for you with your perfectly
functioning epistemologies
mine apparently is broken
yes i did cause all of your devices with
the same name to go off but you have to
admit it's funny
i did that intentionally so those of you
have a device next to you it just gave
you the same answer that i got
oh how's boo
so can you believe that i'm involved in
a genuine schrodinger's cat
situation
all right dig this
so my cat gets a
t-cell lymphoma diagnosis of cancer
she was she had an operation for her
unrelated thing and but they tested and
so oh she also has this
but it was inconclusive
it was an indication that you could see
if there's a lot of swelling
but also if it's this kind of cancer
now she just had an operation in the
place that they took the sample
so was there also swelling
and inflammation
yes
so the indication it could be cancer
or it could be well of course it's just
swelling here that's why it looks that
way
so they did another test
and it came back
ambiguous
so they're going to do another test
and then so then they checked her for
lumps and stuff didn't find any
but there's so i think we have one or
two tests that indicate
there's a good chance she has it and at
least a few tests that don't show it but
probably should have
but none of them are conclusive
so if you know what schrodinger's cat
refers to it's about it's a famous
science slash philosophy
experiment where you put a live cat in a
box
there's some kind of radioactive
decaying thing that's truly random and
if it decays in one way it'll
trigger something that kills the cat
and if it goes another way it doesn't
and the theory is that until you can
observe what's happening inside the box
with the cat
that the cat exists in the state of both
alive and dead
at the same time
now apparently physics requires that to
be true because things don't harden into
a definite thing until they're measured
or observed
why
i don't know
because we're a simulation because
that's the only reason i can think of
we're a simulation that's the only
reason i can think of that things don't
become real until you observe them i
mean really
give me the other reason that that would
be true
i don't think you could come up with one
to me that's the strongest evidence that
we're a simulated environment
the the fact that things don't harden
until they're observed or measured
because that's how you would build
software
because you wouldn't want the software
to build a world just in case somebody
saw it
like the whole universe just in case
no you wouldn't do that you would build
things just in time
so when i dig a hole
there wouldn't actually be anything
underneath the ground
until i start digging because that's the
first time i can observe it
so
uh
pretty sure i had some point i was to
make there
don't agree
don't agree
it's quantum theory anyway so back to my
cat so i literally have a schroedinger's
cat situation
i have a cat
that is either dead or alive
and i don't know
because we can't get a measurement
we're trying to measure but since
there's no definitive measurement it
remains unmeasured
so my cat
is both alive and dead
dead in the sense that if she has this
she has this cancer she only has weeks
to live
and i don't know
i have to live in a world where where
it's a schrodinger's cat she may be
alive for a while she may not be
and
um
i of course believe that i can
manipulate my reality
right
yeah you've seen it you've seen me
indicate that
i believe that if we're a simulation and
the odds of are very great that we are
that there may be a way for us to
manipulate it from within it
to actually program the simulation
now people like it's not a coincidence
that people like elon musk
and people like me
are pro simulation as the most likely
explanation
because
on a smaller scale
than elon musk
we both did things that don't look
possible
often
if i told you the full list
of things that i've personally done
a lot of it you don't know about
because
you know there's there's some
there's some good reason you shouldn't
know about it but if i told you the
things that i've personally influenced
and done you wouldn't believe any of it
because none of it looks real
even i can barely believe it
and imagine being elon musk
how does he wake up in the morning and
think any of this is real
would you think this was real if you
were elon musk i don't think you would
you would think whatever is happening to
me
i must be causing it to happen
and i believe he is i believe he is
causing it to happen and i believe i am
too
so here's where the cat comes in
when i got the cancer
diagnosis
the first time
i said to myself
i'm going to change that
i'm going to make it not true
and the next time i talked to the doctor
she said
you know we're not so sure this is
cancer
we'd better check
and now they're checking
and somehow the cancer
diagnosis
turns into maybe cancer
except she doesn't have any signs of it
i feel like
i schrodinger can in this situation
i feel like i pushed pushed the cat in
one direction here put my finger on the
random generator feels like it
let me tell you another story
similarly maybe i've told you this story
before
years ago i think it was in my 20s
and i got a lump on my neck it was about
the size of like half of a golf ball it
started small but it just sort of grew
over
you know maybe a week or two it was like
this big lump
so i go to the doctor kaiser is my
doctor hmo and doctor looks at it and
says huh um
we better have this x-rayed
and we'll better have x-rayed by the the
cancer
people
and i said oh okay
i realized it could be cancer so that's
why we're checking but what else could
it be
like if it's not cancer
what what could it be
a big old lump that just suddenly forms
and the doctor said
this doctor said
well if it's not cancer
then we'll probably never know what it
was
and it's quote
just one of those things
just one of those things that comes and
goes and you never know what caused it
and you might not even know what made it
go away
so it's either cancer
or just one of those things
so i get x-rayed and i have to wait like
a week
to get in and talk to the
the oncologist
so you go to the oncologist's office i'm
sitting there in a waiting room with
only people who are there for the same
reason
we had all all had a tentative cancer
diagnosis
and this doctor was going to tell us if
it was or was not cancer
so the doctor walks into the waiting
room
he says uh mrs garcia
and and you know i see mrs garcia like
look up all worried and the doctor says
good news
you don't have cancer
tests came back clean
and she's like
and the doctor takes her in to talk with
her some more comes down again
mr jones mr jones is like oh
looks up doctor says mr jones good news
you're clean test came back clean you're
all good come on and we'll talk about it
doctor comes back in the waiting room
and he says
mr adams
i look up and i go
he says
come in my office we need to talk
yup
that actually happened
so i got to go to his office and he says
you know
these x-rays are a little ambiguous
and i said well if it's not cancer
what else could it be
the doctor goes ah
it looks like cancer
but what else could it be
like what are the other possibilities
since you're not positive
what else is going to be
and the doctor said some version of
i don't know if it's not cancer
just one of those things
use different words
so i have to wait more days
with a tentative cancer diagnosis
and
that's a bad week
have you ever had a tentative cancer
diagnosis
it's a bad week
waiting for that
to come in
so
uh finally they say the only way we're
going to know for sure is to take a
sample of it biopsy and so we're going
to make an appointment
this
guy is going to stick a needle into it
and draw out whatever's in inside
and then the doctor says this
if the fluid in there if there's a fluid
in there that's
that's clear
then it's just one of those things it's
not cancer this is one of those things
if it comes out red meaning blood
you have cancer and it's a pretty bad
one
like there's a big old lump on your
throat
so i'm sitting there and i and the
doctor puts in the the needle
and he draws it out
but i can't see it
i forget which side he was i think this
side i can't see it i'm like
i'm like you bastard
start talking
because he knew
that doctor knew if i was basically
alive or dead at that moment
right
you got to tell me that right away
and then i say what is it what is it and
he says oh it's clear liquid
it's just one of those things
and i said well what do i do to treat it
i have this big old lump here i'm
thinking well it's going to be surgery
or something and the guy says i'll take
care of that he sticks the needle in a
second time goes
takes out the rest of the juice
puts a band-aid on it and sends me home
cured
cured
now
at the time
um i thought i did have a cancer
diagnosis and i did think i needed to
change reality
because i was in a schrodinger's cat
situation
and i said to myself if i have any
control over this universe
i'm going to put my finger on the random
number generator now
so i did
you know sort of mentally
still here
so i'm going to try to save my cat the
same way
yeah they did say it might be cat
scratch fever that's a so i'm seeing
your comments that they did mention that
it might be that
um
and so that's my story
sometimes
you might be able to put your finger on
the random number generator
all right i gotta run now
and
uh is a pleasure to speak with you as
always
