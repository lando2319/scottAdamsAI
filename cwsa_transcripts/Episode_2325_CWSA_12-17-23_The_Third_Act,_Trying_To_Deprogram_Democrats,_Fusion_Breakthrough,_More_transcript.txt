[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and wow
you're lucky you're lucky to be here
because we're going to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even imagine with their little human
brains and all you need for that is a
cuper muger a glass a tanker cheler
Stein a canteen Jo or flask a vegetable
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopam Mee h
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen right now
go oh it is
culated savor
it all right uh some how about some
science news so uh there's a new AI that
can read your brain and turn it into
text on the screen that's right so they
did a test where they put uh little
sensors on somebody's head and they said
read read these
selections and as the person was reading
the selection the AI was uh typing it
now you say to yourself that's not
special we've always had voice
recognition except it wasn't using voice
recognition
the voice recognition part was you know
not part of the the test they were
testing if it could directly tell the
word you were thinking because you were
reading it and it could do it now you
you've heard before that there's there
have been other ways to you know create
a an image of what you're thinking and
stuff but this is the time they've taken
it all the way to the word level with
without being uh intrusive like putting
a chip in your head if they had a chip
in your head you you could understand it
but they can now read your actual
thoughts in
words your actual thoughts in words now
the article that I read didn't have
anything about this
point but how do you not use that for uh
a light
detector have we are we on the edge of
creating an actual lie detector that
works
because if you didn't know this the LIE
detectors that we've had for
decades they don't pass any kind of
scientific riger meaning that if the
light detector said you lied it doesn't
mean you did and if it said you told the
truth it doesn't really mean you
did um I don't know if you know this but
the main way that you use a light
detector is to scare people into telling
the truth because they think the light
detector is working so you can use that
f false that false understanding to kind
of pressure them into telling you the
truth so the way you do that would
be uh really really so you say you
weren't there uhhuh uhuh well uh getting
some interesting readings on the LI
detector so let me ask the question
again yeah you so you see where that's
going right so the person thinks oh my
God oh my God it knows I'm lying so I
better change it to you know tell the
truth and try to make that work somehow
so that that's how light detectors work
they work by not working but making
people think they
did uh and that's the reason light
detectors are not acceptable in court
because they're too
unreliable well up the road for me uh
the town next to me uh Lawrence
Livermore
lab uh they've now triggered four and a
six attempts they have created Fusion
that created more energy than it took to
turn it
on four and a six
times now um here's a little
backstory I think it was
maybe five or six years
ago um I had a brief talk with uh Sam
mman who who you know of course now is
famous for being the head of Chad GPT
um but he was you know it's not the only
thing he's involved in he's a general
investor and one of the things he told
me and this is several years ago is if
Fusion had already been solved in terms
of the
science what had not been solved is the
engineering how do you actually build
the thing and his take was that once
once it goes from is it scientifically
possible to well we don't know how to do
it but we think we might be able to
figure fur out with engineering that
once you've reached that engineering
phase it's
guaranteed and I never really thought of
it that way but I have to I actually
adopt that opinion that once you've
reached the engineering stage it's about
tweaking and testing and adjusting and
you know moving toward it but if they've
achieved four and of six attempts where
they've created more than they consumed
in
energy I think knocking on the door so I
think Fusion is certainly within the
next 10 years might take longer to build
a working infusion reactor but I feel
like we're at least 10 years
away now remember everybody used to say
oh Scott that's what they said about the
flying car but where's my flying
car well do you have Instagram because
they're advertising lots of flying
cars if you want a flying car
they're for sale you can actually buy
your flying car now the flying cars are
not going to be you know street legal so
much and then also flying they're more
like just flying but it's basically a
flying car for all practical
purposes so yes Fusion like the flying
car may take longer than we wanted but
it looks like it's going to come there's
a study that says narcissists May engage
in feminist activism more more than
other
people uh do you know what category of
science I'm going to put this in this is
in the category of science you could
just asked
me you could have saved a lot of time
and money just ask me next time hey
Scott do you think that narcissists are
attracted to the types of activities
where they can celebrate their
superiority over other people well I
don't know what's the definition of
narcissism well uh the a quick
definition would be people who like to
celebrate their superiority over other
people and and that's what feminism does
right yes okay I'm going to go with more
more narcissists are attracted to that
because it's exactly in their sweet
spot of
course yeah of
course um so you didn't have to do that
study could have saved you some
time uh Jeff Bezos agrees with Elon Musk
that the population of humans should be
you know in the trillions and we'd be
better off and we'd have more uh more uh
Geniuses if we had trillions of people
which is true the more Geniuses you have
the better off you
are so that's a two
brilliant billionaires who think we need
more people not fewer are you convinced
how many of you on this live stream are
convinced that it's a true statement we
need more people not
fewer it's pretty basic
economics yeah it's basic economics it
too few people is way bigger problem
than not than too many in in our current
environment you know not in every
case so yeah I think that's it's turning
into common knowledge but I think it's
more commonly known on the right
where people are in favor of having lots
of babies and on the left they still
think it's I don't know some kind of
evil well uh Kanye is back using X I
guess he was already approved for X but
hadn't been using it recently he's got
some kind of $200 foldable sock
boots that is I guess his first new
product since Adidas canceled
them um I don't know about about his
timing
though you know I I assume this has been
in the works for a while building this
product
and and now when he decides to go public
again you know after his long
disappearance um and of course the knock
on him is that he was
anti-semitic let me ask you
this was this the right time for an
accused anti-semite to
resurface I think I might have waited
another few
months like I suppose he could have done
it on October 7th you really make a
really make a statement but this is not
exactly a perfect combination of the way
people are
feeling with his launch of his new
product
so yeah not not ideal but he's back
we'll see if that
lasts well let's talk about that Senate
staffer who had some uh gay sex in the
so-called Senate hearing
room and apparently the senator you know
parted ways with him and he he released
the
staffer uh but NBC News reported it this
way their headlin said Senator bar Ben
carden's office has parted ways with a
staffer who conservative news outlets
Alle Ed was shown in a leaked video
having sex in the Senate hearing room
yeah because it was only the
conservatives who were talking about
that
story and alleged
alleged he's already admitted
it the the alleged staffer is completely
admitted it happen he's not even
fighting the on any kind of factual
basis he's already put out a statement
about it yeah it's alleged by all those
right-wing
people I guess well in a totally
unrelated story there's some farmers in
Great Britain who couldn't figure out
why their cows were all alarmed they
seemed to be stressed out and they found
there was a young man who had been
climbing into the uh the fenc area with
the cows and having sex with the cows
and they they caught him uh I was going
to say
red-handed but I don't think his hand
was involved his pants were down
so they may they may may have caught him
red something but not
handed um and apparently he was banging
a lot of the cows so he was a cow Banger
and you know what's really
unfair yeah you have sex with one
cow for the rest of your life you're
going to be a cow seems unfair
but in his case apparently he was uh he
was hurting the cows
he was hurting the
cows he was hurting
them that's all I got come on if you
don't like your cow sex jokes with puns
you came to the wrong place he was
hurting them yeah it was an utter
disaster yeah I'm probably going to milk
this for all it's
worth all right
um but he got caught you know that's uh
let me tell you something that is not
the kind of thing I want to see anywhere
in my cow field or am I right you don't
want to look at your cow field and see
someone bagging a
cow that sort of thing belongs somewhere
else well you can take that somewhere
else the Senate hearing room for example
apparently anything goes in
there so take your cow there
um here's a little uh alarming news from
Hawaii now it's in the news but I also
knew about this
personally so you might know that a lot
of people own property in Maui that they
rent out to other vacationers when
they're not using it and the governor of
uh Maui is telling those people that
they're going to take their property and
they're going to put uh residents in it
who are homeless because the the of fire
that's right if your business your
livelihood was renting your your
property in Maui the government's just
going to take it and put uh and put the
permanent residence in there and you
won't be able to rent it
out now they do say that they'll
compensate but I don't think they're
going to compensate at the vacation or
level probably something closer to like
a a normal rent in the area which would
be much lower than a vacationer would
would pay so that's a real thing there
are people who thought that they had an
income from renting these things and
they you know took several months off
because nobody was going for a while and
now now they can rent them again because
Maui's open and the governor is saying
that they're going to force them they're
going to force them to give up their
businesses and and put it in the
government's hands for as long as the
government wants to do it now that's
pure communism isn't
it how is that
legal like I I get that it's an
emergency you know I understand it but
how is it legal I don't understand
it um Arizona governor Katie hubs she
signed an order she had threatened to do
this but now she signed an order
deploying the National Guard to the
state's border because of all the
immigration
problems um now what's notable is that
she's a
Democrat right so even the Democrats are
very
aware that something isn't
working so they're going to have to do
something well here's what I call the
third act update I call the third act
the
possibility now this is just for fun
just for fun right the possibility that
Trump's story will follow a movie Arc
meaning that he's already he hit the
third act which is January 6 not only
did he lose the
election at least officially but he also
was so damaged by the allegations of
January 6 that he was an insurrectionist
he'd never be able to run again he you
know he'd be lucky to stay in a jail he
still is still would be lucky to stand
in jail so that's the third act it can't
get much worse than that you lost the
election and they might put you in jail
that's pretty bad but here are three
things that are
Brewing they're all Brewing now I've
told you about these so these are just
updates because the third Act is
tantalizing because you can see it
coming if you watch a movie and your
hero is in the worst possible situation
and it's half an hour before the end of
the movie you know you look at your
watch and go oh that's the third act
then you you can always tell the Third
back cuz it's just time for it you you
know when it's it's about ready to
happen and it's about ready to happen if
it's going to
happen now I think it's too soon so it
looks like it's just the cats on the
roof you know it's like slowly building
up but here are the things that might
happen I'm not predicting they will but
there is a predictive framework called
the third act that does predict
it so rasmuson gives us updates all the
time the rasmuson account on a um and
there's a report that Georgia Governor
Brian Kemp has notified uh their
Secretary of State Brad
renberger that there are over 177,000
invalid votes and I understand that on
Monday there's some kind of meeting or
hearing about them and that those
177,000 votes might be thrown away
away now that's far more than the number
of votes needed to reverse the outcome
of that
election so do you think it'll
happen remember remember the rule the
rule never
changes 95% at least that's the minimum
95% of all election rigging claims will
turn out to be false as they have been
so well so far closer to 100% right uh
at least of the significant ones that
would change the election but it's out
there and apparently it's enter the
official domain you know it's not just
people talking about it it's people in
government talking about it and
seriously having to make decisions so on
Monday it's entirely possible there'll
be some news about the election I doubt
it but
maybe well at the same time remember
that alleged
uh locked closet that supposedly has a
bunch of fake ballots in it and if and
if people could see it it might reverse
the
election um we don't know why but now
for hundreds of days I believe the judge
has failed to rule one way or another on
whether we can have access we the public
can have access to the
room and there's no reason for it and
and the judge is breaking the law I
think or at least breaking a standard by
going more than 90 days without even
responding one way or the other so
there's a really really obvious ignoring
of the legal process which suggests
guilt would you
agree the the fact that there's a judge
that could simply just say well just
open the
door just open the door and have them
check seems like the simplest thing you
just want to see what's in there and
it's public information and you want to
audit
just to make sure sure open the door see
what's in
there but no answer no there's not a no
there's not a yes just it act like it
doesn't exist well that suggests that
there's a problem and the judge suspects
there's a
problem so that's two separate
things that could change the you know
your understanding of the 2020
election think about the timing it's
happening in the run up to the the
election so now we're now within a year
of the election and you've got two
things
Brewing that could make Trump
right very
interesting again if you said gun to
your head you've got to make a bet on it
Scott will either of these things pan
out I would bet against them I would bet
against them probably won't pan out just
like everything else but it's really fun
that they're out
there here's another thing from
uh they did a poll and 10% of the people
they talked to said that uh they
admitted they had a friend or co-worker
or acquaintance who admitted to them
that they cast a mailin ballot in a
state other than their own
State 10% of the people questioned in
this General poll of the public 10% of
them said they personally knew somebody
who had cheated in the election by
voting in a state where they didn't
live now rason did the math and said
well if there are6 million voters is and
10% of
them know somebody who did something
illegal that would be U you know 16
million
people did they do the math
right 10% of the people said they knew
somebody who said they cheated 10% just
knew somebody
and so they multiplied 10% times the
number of Voters and found out there
could be 16 million wrong
votes no that is not the right
math I don't think you can do the right
math on this you don't have enough
information but at the very least you
should acknowledge that if there is one
person who says they know somebody who
cheated that one
person may have talked to a number of
people so there might be one cheater and
and 10 of their friends know about
it right but it's only one cheater it's
not 10 people 10 people just know about
it so you don't count the 10 people you
count the one person that 10 people know
about now it's probably not 10 might be
five or three or something but it's not
it's not it's not 16 million it's
probably if you were really to do the
math if you could probably be 10% of
that that's still 1.6 million
people right it doesn't it doesn't make
the point any less valid 1.6 million
would be plenty you know to change the
election because the the things were so
close in the Battleground States so
again a poll of that type is not
conclusive of
anything but you've got three
really solid idly brewing
things that suggest the third Act is
coming we'll see we'll
see all right uh there's an obesity
report galloped did a survey 38% of
American adults were beast in 2023 up
from 32% in 2019 that's a pretty big
gain um and of
course almost certainly was the pandemic
apparently people are eating worse
after the
pandemic and they're cooking less at
home probably a door Dash think people
got used to Door Dash I think or eating
out and uh
wow they say it's up eight percentage
points oh that's better at least they
don't say it's up 8% it's up um and then
people between 45 and 64 had the highest
obesity rate at
44% doeses that sound right to you 44%
that sounds low to
me kind of low there there are places in
this country where you won't even see
anybody in that age who's not obese like
you could stand on the street and there
wouldn't be anybody at that age there
would be people who are not obese but
they would be under 45 there just
wouldn't be anybody in some places
yeah well um continue to be fascinated
about uh Tucker Carlson's take on the
aliens now he does have more information
than the rest of us because he's talked
to more people in person and probably
heard things that have not been
aired so keep in mind he knows more than
we do about this question of whether
aliens have been to
Earth but let me say it again there's no
there's no chance aliens have been
to there's really no chance that that's
true in my opinion no chance chance now
could I be wrong yes
yes but let me ask you
this humans have been around for 200,000
years and you've been around for you
know maybe well under a 100
years what are the odds that you're
alive when when aliens visited the
Earth
100%
I'm going to say I don't think aliens
have visited the earth now if you take
the question to do I think a probe might
have landed from another planet as
opposed to a piloted ship with an alien
in it oh now that's a little more
likely yeah who built the Pyramid Scott
who built the pyramids shouting at me in
all
caps well I should only answer answer
people who write in all caps with
shouting answers I don't know who built
them I don't know who built
them maybe aliens maybe human maybe a
human civilization was smarter I don't
know but an but if the Earth had been
seated by various probes it would answer
a lot of
questions it would answer a lot of
questions who knows I'm going to bet
against the
aliens apparently the head of the main
pack the political action group that
raises money for candidates for disantis
guy named roow um he's quitting so he's
leaving the uh pack because he cannot
says he cannot in good conscience stay
Affiliated uh because some bad things
they did I
guess apparently they're backing some
fake statements and he doesn't want to
back that uh what is the name of the
political action committee that he is
quitting checking notes it's called The
Never Back Down Never back down so the
head of the Never Back Down committee
he's uh well he's backing down he's
backing
down
so I don't know how else to report that
he's sort of backing
down now I guess he had a good reason
but everybody who backs down has a good
reason that's why you do it all
right Trump uh once again repeated his
uh successful campaign uh process of
going to a UFC fight and making a big
deal the crowd went wild when he went to
the newest fight and I love the video of
him he goes over and he makes a appoint
to shake hands with Joe Rogan you know
kind of goes out of his way to lean over
people and make sure he shakes hands
with
Rogan now that's good
politicking do you know how many
votes Trump solidifies when somebody
sees a video of Joe Rogan smiling and
shaking his
hand now I feel a little sorry for Joe
Rogan because he doesn't try to be that
political you know he talks about
some stuff that's political but he's not
overtly political I mean he's much you
know more broad than
that but he got sucked into being on a
viral video shaking hands with Trump and
smiling now he does seem to be at the
moment reasonably Pro Trump at least in
recognizing that their things Trump did
correctly but I think he got a little
sucked into that I don't I don't know if
he loves
that I I suspect that when Rogan looks
at that video he's going to say ah he
got me like he he sucked me into doing
something that looks like sort of a
pocket endorsement without being an
endorsement I don't want I don't want to
accidentally look like he endorsed a
candidate but uh anyway so Trump made a
big big uh big impact there it was
probably good but in a rally speech um
he once again found a way to lose um and
it's going to take him some
work Trump is going to have to work hard
to make this a close election cuz if all
he does is just go to UFC fights and you
know go to his court cases he's going to
win in a landslide the only way you
could lose is by saying something you
shouldn't say in
public so see what he said about the
immigration quote they're poisoning the
blood of our country
oh
boy how do you think that went
over they're poisoning the blood of our
country
wow uh do you imagine that the Democrats
said Nazi that sounds like a Nazi yes
they did do you think that Trump should
have been able to anticipate that using
those phrases they're poisoning the
blood of our country do you think he
should have known that that was going to
be taken the wrong
way yes he
should however I do think that he's
leading him into the narrow
Ravine because I think he knows now that
he can mock the dictator thing uh out of
existence because he's already shown
that he can do it uh I think he's lead
to me this looks like a trap I mean I I
feel like he intentionally
use language that people are going to
interpret as you know going too far just
so he could lead them into the narrow
Ravine and say so what do you think I am
Thanos or something so I call it the
Thanos approach that trumps so bad but
as soon as his he has all the jewels and
his bejweled glove he'll snap his glove
fingers and half of all the people on
Earth will die because Hitler is not bad
enough you know I mean Hitler killed
Millions sure that's bad
but Thanos well that's billions so they
should go full Thanos or at least we
should when we mock
them um anyway that was probably an
ill-advised choice of words except that
I think it's going to work exactly the
way he wants it
to I I think it's actually going to work
even though I wouldn't have done it I
wouldn't have recommended it but I think
it's going to work just the
same well I I I did a post on X that
appears to be going viral and people are
making a lot of comments about it so I
thought I would just read it to you it's
a little lengthy thread but rather than
summarize it's easier to read it to you
and here's what I said I said uh dear
Democrats I'm sorry your media has done
this to you I realize you have no
mechanism for knowing how brainwashed
you are and as a trained hypnotist I am
genuinely empathetic about it which is
all true it does look terrible you know
and I feel sorry for it um and I went on
I said I mean no disrespect which is
also true uh because brainwashing is
more powerful than brains that's why it
works so I I see them as victims I don't
see them as my enemies or anything like
that talking about
Democrats uh and then I said one way out
of your mental prison is to ask yourself
which countries are okay with changing
the basic nature of their societies via
unchecked
immigration that's a pretty good kill
shot just ask them what country is okay
with changing the nature of their
existing Society via unchecked
immigration now there are lots of
countries that have immigration but how
many of them have enough immigration
that they know for sure they're changing
the entire nature of their country and
they're okay with it now you say the
Germans but I say that's the German
government what what Society wants to
change itself not the German people are
you telling me the German people by a
majority wanted to no longer be like
Germans they wanted to change and be L
say Islamic or
something doesn't seem
likely you know I I'll give you that
there are some governments doing some
things but I don't think the people are
largely on the same side there um and
certainly if they knew the extent of it
and then I said if such countries exist
you know ones that do want to change
themselves via unchecked immigration if
such countries exist and unchecked
immigration is working out great for
them you might be right you might be
right that uh the right- Wingers and
Trump are like
Hiller cuz if unchecked regul uh
immigration turns out to be popular and
there are countries that are benefiting
from it and they don't mind that their
National character is altered
forever well then you're right sounds to
me if that were true then the right-
wiers would be kind of going too far but
you got to give me an
example give me an example of a country
where that's true where unchecked
immigration is making him pretty happy I
don't think you can which is why it's a
good kill
shot and then I go
on and say if no such country exists
consider that you have been the victim
of brainwashing the real kind and that
this type of manipulation is the basic
nature of American
society it has been for
decades that has been for
decades is the persuasive part
because if I just said hey they're
fooling you this week that's easy to
dismiss but if you say you understand
that for decades this has been true and
you would have to believe that this is
the only time it's not
true are you willing to do that are you
willing to say that for decades it's
been very very true but hey how lucky
they just stopped doing it for some
reason it was working totally the way
they wanted it to work for decades
but then they just
stopped why why would they
stop what what would make you stop doing
something that worked for
decades so that's that's the thing that
you want you need the brainwash people
to think about they they should
understand that brainwashing is the norm
and always has
been then I went on and said next ask
yourself if anyone has ever used a
complex model to predict anything about
the future climate or otherwise you will
learn it isn't a thing and never has
been models do not predict the future
nothing else does either not
horoscopes not tea leaves not psychics
not magic eight balls nothing no models
don't do it if you could predict the
future with
models people would be doing it all over
the place but it's not a thing thing
your real enemies are the brainwashers
in charge I said not the so-called
rightwing there is a common enemy the
common enemy is whoever is brainwashing
all of us some more than others but
because I know the left will say butd
the right is brainwashed it's not us I
said the political right can be duded
and wrong too but it never looks like
the result of organized brainwashing
just an attraction to conspiracy
theories too many of which have proven
true
so you have to say you know both sides
have something going on otherwise nobody
takes you seriously if you can't say
okay both sides have something going on
but it's a little
different a little
different all right so apparently that's
going a little bit viral at the
moment
um so uh Jonathan Turley is talking
about the hunter Biden situation and
says that uh made a breathtaking
Mistake by going to the you know the
capital and simply announcing that he
wasn't going to talk to the to the uh
Senate
um and that the problem with that is
that
uh what is the
crime oh that he told his
father uh that so apparently John uh uh
Karine John prier said that President
Biden was certainly familiar with what
his son was going to say when Hunter
said in public that he was going to
refuse going into testify which would
put uh hunter in contempt of congress
you know just like Bannon was in
contempt for the same thing so we assume
that there's at least some risk for
Hunter to be found in contempt but
here's the part that is interesting if
he discussed it with his
father Joe Biden might be in
trouble because it it would look like he
colluded with the
president to resist Congress and break
the law by well you know having showing
contempt for congress basically so that
would be some kind of obstruction of a
uh government
process would would they be obstructing
an official government
process is that
what is that is isn't that an
Insurrection if you try to stop a
government process I thought that's
whole reason that that Trump is uh in
trouble so now we know for sure because
it came right from the president's own
spokesperson the hunter who tried to
thwart a government process the
investigation
worked with his father and his father
was aware and therefore could have
stopped it because you know he's a
president of the United States
uh probably had to agree with
it right don't you think that Joe Biden
had to say yes to
it because he couldn't just listen to it
and let it happen could he I don't know
to me it puts Joe Biden in exactly this
position of trump as person who could
have done something different he was in
the job where it's sort of your
responsibility to do something in these
situations and there was a alleged
obstruction of a government official
process now is there a difference
between
certifying uh
electors and having an
investigation is one of them a
government official government process
but the other one is just something the
government's doing is there some kind of
Distinction there because it seems to me
the whole obstructing the government
thing was totally made up there's not
even a law about that they they took an
existing law about destroying documents
you know from the Enron era that's what
the law was for and they over applied it
to trying to slow down a government you
know
process so I no if you're going to over
apply that law you better keep over
applying it consistently which would
make Joe Biden look like he's in a
little bit of
trouble so that's interesting that's why
you should read Jonathan Turley because
he's he's pulling the nuggets out of
these stories that I would not have seen
well CNN is getting some attention by uh
reporting
honestly the
obvious the the true story people are
giving CNN credit for not
lying here's the
context smires was talking to a legal
expert Eli honig on smes' show and I
always tell you this marones is not like
the other CNN
hosts I've told you that a bunch of
times he actually seems to be just
interested in what's true like I've been
watching him for a long time
and he will
consistently try to get at the truth and
he will ignore the narrative even if
it's the common CNN narrative so I have
full respect for smes I've been on his
show a few times and
uh and I always thought he was a a fair
fair broker but you know asked the tough
questions because that's his job but
anyway Eli
honig uh and smish seem to agree with
each other that the the legal stuff
against Donald Trump is clearly and
obviously
political if only because of the
schedule so they agreed that the that
the prosecutor is rushing to do
something that is not typical you
normally the case would take longer than
the election so the election would be
over before any outcomes of the uh
trials now if that was the case I
suppose it creates the problem that you
know once you're the president
you know you got some extra powers to
Pardon yourself or
whatever so they want to get it done
before he's president so he can't pardon
himself I
guess but both both these CNN
personalities smires and Eli honig they
both said just directly Without Really
hedging it at all that it's obviously
political it's obviously political and
they reported it like that's just a fact
it's a fact that is
obvious so what do you make of
that sort of surprising but if it was
going to come from anybody it would come
from smires now I've told you before
that the in my opinion there are two
voices on CNN who have the potential to
be objective you know they're not going
to just buy the narrative one is fared
Zakaria and he just came out strongly
against the current immigr ation
practices of the country and in favor of
tightening the
Border just like I thought he would
because that's the only smart take on it
and then smires is looking at the
lawfare against President Trump and he's
saying the obvious this is obviously
illegitimate basically that's my word
not his but that's the sense of it it's
illegitimate because it's political not
not a legal
process
so uh
smes went to your local high
school well I wouldn't judge him from
that all
right so that's
interesting um as you know there are
some missiles a whole bunch of them
coming out of Yemen at ships in the uh
Red Sea and apparently the United States
is now talking about attacking Yemen
because you know what we
need third war yeah we we want to have
wars going on and Ukraine Gaza how about
Yemen how about Yemen now to be fair
Yemen's asking for it apparently it's
the hoodies not all of Yemen
but there there have been dozens of
these drone attacks apparently we're
pretty good at shooting down
drones because we shot down a few dozen
of them uh but what do you think are we
going to attack Yemen
yeah here's what I think if we attack
Yemen we should just destroy
it like I I'm so done with calculated
attacks we should either leave them
alone or just level it
because I don't know I don't want
another one of these half
Wars but I I suppose I'd be happier
having no war then cuz I don't want to
level Yemen it's you know primarily
innocent people who probably don't know
anything about any
missiles so but I don't see the benefit
of doing a strategic attack I don't
think it'll stop them it'll just anger
them yeah on the other hand do you not
attack somebody because it will make
them matter when they attacked you first
I don't know I don't know what you do in
this
situation uh but uh I would certainly
look for at least a decapitation strike
I wouldn't go after the missiles because
you wouldn't be able to hit all the
missiles you're going to have to go
after a decapitation strike and I would
tell Yemen hey Yemen if we respond we're
just going to go after your leaders
we're not even going to go after the
assets um there's a
poll uh Harvard Harris polling that 51%
of Young Americans support
ending
Israel and giving it to
Hamas over half of young people 18 to 24
so it's just 18 to 24 over half of them
want to give Israel to
Hamas so have I ever told you at what
age your brain is done
developing so this is the age 18 to
24 uh at age 25 your brain is roughly
done developing so when your brain has
not been developed you think Israel
should go away and when your brain is
developed you're more likely to
say everybody's colonized
something yeah everybody's colonized
something all
right Bill Mah says and I think this is
the only point you need to know and and
this is why young people don't
understand the situation
how many young people do you think
understand that if Israel made peace
they would just be
destroyed like they don't really have an
option of just standing
down they don't know that so Bill Mar
says all wars end with negotiation but
it's hard to negotiate when the other
side's bargaining position is you all
die and
disappear the the whole
two-state solution is pure Danger
dreaming is people who don't know
anything about what's happening if you
knew that the only thing that would make
the extremists were in charge and the
extremists are always in charge uh the
only thing that make him happy is the
end of Israel there's no two stay
solution and and I I go further than
that do you know why I have limited
empathy for the Gaza situation as tragic
as it is my my actual empathy is much
lower than you would expect to be for
the degree of you know death and
destruction that's happening and the
reason is that both sides are getting
what they
want I've never seen that before I've
never seen a war where both sides were
winning here's what I
mean Israel probably needed to get rid
of Gaza at some point so to them it
feels like winning because they can get
rid of Hamas so they're not going to
stop they're not going to stop because
they're winning what does Hamas want
Hamas wants to um you know unify the
Arab world against Israel is it working
looks like it yeah yeah Saudi Arabia is
not taking the bait you it looks like
there's still going to be a uh the
adults in the room it looks like but
yeah it's working yeah I would say
public opinion has absolutely turned
against Israel they have destroyed the
Holocaust narrative that was the primary
asset of Israel because now they can
saywell look what you did you know sure
why should we care about the Holocaust
when look what you did now I know it's
not a good comparison I'm saying that's
what they'll say and it will work so why
would Hamas what the end the fighting to
stop when what they wanted really was
the most amount of death and destruction
of their own people to get this larger
gain which is at the long run it makes
maybe Israel weaker
so how can I how can I vote to end a war
that both sides think they're
winning it feels like I just want to
stay out of it hey you guys you want to
fight so and the people who talk about
the peace deal or a ceasefire I don't
even understand that why would you have
a ceasefire when nether side wants it
and neither side would find a benefit in
it so it's the weirdest situation where
both sides want to be in a war there's
not one side that wants to negotiate and
the other one wants a war they both want
to be doing exactly what they're doing
which is why they're doing it if either
side wanted to not do this it wouldn't
be happening it takes both of
them they both have to be really
committed and want
this so anybody who from the outside who
wants to tell them to stop doing
it
why would they they're both getting what
they want and if we don't understand
they're both getting what they want
nothing makes
sense you're you're just going to be
spinning your wheels like hey why don't
we all get together and talk about this
let's draw up some lines for what a
two-state solution would look
like forget it forget it it it looks to
me like a a war of
extermination it's just slow
motion and what I mean by that is Israel
can't really survive in the long run
because they're going to be S surrounded
by people want to kill them who will
continually increase their ability to do
so so even though you can take Hamas
down to
zero you know they can get pretty close
to zero they'll just come back again
different people different place they
just come back again so
honestly how could Israel exist for 200
years surrounded by people whose only
objective is to destroy them I don't
know how you could ever do it
so so the Hamas supportive people have a
long-term plan of extermination of which
this is just a key part of it so their
plan for genocide of the
Israelis is going along the way they
want
meanwhile the Israelis are increasing
their territory and getting rid of Hamas
and they're doing exactly what they
want exactly what they want
so it looks to me like Israel is winning
in the short run in terms of militarily
and that Hamas absolutely won in the
long
run now could that change well yes
because it's not yet the long run there
could be other things that change that
would yet again you know reframe the
long run but at the moment you have a
situation where Israel is pretty much
guaranteed to win the Shor run and Hamas
has created a situation where they're
kind of guaranteed to win in the long
run and I'm going to be honest Israel
should look for another location as a
backup
plan I hate to say it right I hate to
say it but if it were me I'd definitely
be looking for a backup plan because the
thing that the thing they want well two
things two things you
know look at me talking for Israelis
like I know what I'm talking about but
I'll do it anyway I would imagine that
there are two major factors one is the
the history of the
area like there's a there's a connection
to the history of the land itself and
that's
important unfortunately both sides have
that same connection to the same land
but on top on top of that there there's
an
overarching desire to have a Jewish
state that can be
safe and you'll hear people say that if
Israel Falls that Jews all over the
world will feel less safe because it's
like a backup plan like you could always
go to Israel if things turn bad in the
country you're in you could just Escape
go to Israel
so I actually
think that if you want a 200-year plan
you better have a second Israel back as
your backup plan you better have a
second Israel lined up
somewhere and you might have to give up
that connection to the
land but far more important is survival
and I don't see a survival plan for 200
years can and let me ask you am I being
um too
negative because I can't understand how
a tiny piece of land
surrounded by so much hate where the
where the ability of any individual to
cause trouble will go up forever so one
person with you know a biological agent
and a drone can take him T aiv in 200
years right at the moment not quite but
in 200 years an individual will be able
to get a nuclear weapon in 200
years so how could it possibly
survive you know and if you imagine ways
that Israel could survive for 200 years
you have to say well the uh is Islam
will you know reform or something and
they'll stop caring so much does it look
like that might happen it could I mean
200 years is a long time could but I
think that even if Islam in in the
Middle East did a major major
reform so that 80% of all the people
there were on board with you know just
moderate get along with everybody that
would still leave 20% of a growing and
large population that wants nothing but
to destroy Israel at any price it feels
like that's too many like you couldn't
you couldn't brainwash or let's say
educate uh the local population even in
200 years
to get rid of all of it you know all of
the negative feelings against Israel I
mean they've lasted how long how long
has there been negative feelings against
Jews it's not like it happened last year
right there there's something going on
the last thousands of years and I can't
imagine it will end in 200 years
so while I'm 100% backing Israel on
their um October 7th response and I
would would do the same thing they're
doing that's why I back them you know I
can't complain about somebody who would
do exactly what I would have done in
that situation
exactly like how am I going to criticize
that so they're in a tough
spot and um I since I wish wish them the
best I really think maybe secretly you
don't want to say it publicly cuz it you
never want to say it publicly but Secret
there ought to be some people looking
for a backup plan because you're going
to need one
eventually all right and that ladies and
gentlemen is all I wanted to say today
in my most excellent live stream
possibly the best thing you'll ever see
is there anything that uh
now bad bad take is an unacceptable
response that's an NPC response uh when
I hear somebody say bad take do you know
what my ears here my ears here I'm that
you are
underinformative
so you need to separate between I don't
like what you're saying to I have a
reason that you're
wrong all right some of you are saying
it just to be just to be
trolls uh this needed to start
yesterday uh Molen salt reactors you
know I think Molen salt reactors got a
setback didn't
they uh um I need somebody to give me a
fact check wasn't there was it new scale
was Nu new scale was name of a uh Gen 4
nuclear reactor that I think Bill Gates
was
backing and it had some approvals and it
looked like it was going forward and
then they had to pull back because
something wasn't
working do I have that
right so that doesn't mean that the uh
molten salt reactors won't be a big
thing but I think the most promising IND
company doing it uh had a big setback
recently and I can't remember if it was
a regulatory setback or a techical one
but it
was uh I somebody says no it's not
backed by
gates are you saying that new scale is
not backed by Gates or are you saying
that new scale is not molten
salt which are you
saying yeah I thought thought it was a
regulatory problem not a technical
problem but I don't I'm just going off
of
memory you have an argument Jews will
not relocate too much
history that's not a so so the person
who said I had a bad take is saying that
Jews will not relocate because there's
too much history you don't think that's
Incorporated in my
opinion of course
this so are you telling me that if
Israel became a uh
smoldering nuclear uh hole in the
ground the Jews would still want to go
into the radiated nuclear hole in the
ground because of their historical
connection to it that's that's your
point they wouldn't want to go to
someplace safe they would rather go to
the smoldering smoking
irradiated place where they'll die in a
day
because nothing matters except going to
that piece of land safety doesn't matter
is that your point see when I said when
I said that when you said bad take and I
said bad take is a signal that you don't
have a take and then you came back with
but Jews will want to live there no
matter what that wasn't a
take you know that's not true you know
it's just a case of how much danger
there is they're not going to live there
if it's infinite danger it guaranteed
death you know that don't even pretend
that that's your real argument that's
not your real argument you just said
that cuz I caught you having no argument
you just didn't like it that's what
happened all
right uh who propos being in a black
light into the
sun I would love to see Matt Gates bring
a black light into the the Senate
hearing
room you know what would be the funny
part see I'm imagining this in my mind
all right imagine they they turn down
the lights and Matt Gat sneaks in there
with a black light and they go to the
place where the filming was and you know
the black light picks up let's say
biologics but here's the funny part then
they go around the whole
room and they they find out the whole
thing is just
splattered the entire room appar
apparently it's been used every night
for every night for hundreds of years
all the game members of of the
government go in there and just you know
just knock it
out that would be the funniest show of
all and now the black light in the
Senate hero and then then then you take
the black light and you go to the Oval
Office like you just do the whole
capital and you find out the whole thing
the whole place is just covered with
jizz because that's what it's kind of
how I see it it'd be hard to explain
Washington unless that's
true all
right so how long did it take from the
time that I said uh the public should
not see the Epstein flight logs because
there'd be too many innocent people
dragged into it how long did it take
before somebody said an X well I guess
you were on that flight weren't
you that is so NPC
no I've never been on an Epstein flight
I've never met him uh but oh my God you
you have to do this you have to avoid
the most obvious thing to say in every
situation that was the most obvious
thing to say it's like well if your
opinion is we shouldn't have that list
you must be on it right just so obvious
and and I'm not even mad is the
accusation because I get accused of so
many things that that's just you know
irrelevant but I'm just so offended that
your lack of creativity would bring you
to that place if you say the most
obvious
thing let's try it you know uh I was
thinking of uh looking for a really good
form of
exercise anybody swimming is the best
form of exercise say the NPC thank you
yeah cuz it's the most obvious thing to
say in that situation let's do another
one hey the science has found a new uh
form of uh food that comes in packets
and it's like a good protein Source soil
and green is soil and green soil and
green is
people
yeah don't say the most obvious things
please stop it stop
it took a boat to the island yeah all
right um at least release the passengers
that flew to the island Brian you you
don't seem to be following along too too
well here
no it's the people who flew to the
island that are the problem because
people flew to the island not
necessarily for bad things probably a
lot of people went to the island and
didn't know what was going on
all
right uh half the population is below
average sorry Dean but you were trying
to be clever there and you failed no
half the population is not below
average
sorry they might be below the median but
no they're not below
average I mean it might be but that's
not what average
means all right um so thank you for
joining YouTube another Banger
