[Music]
hey everybody
i hope you're done with church
because it's time for the next
form of worship in this case
it's coffee i worship my coffee
it's not an actual religion but it could
be
and if you'd like to give it a try
grab your cup your bug your glass your
tanker your stein your chalice your
thermos fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
simultaneous
sip
hmm that could have been warmer
well so msnbc was in full propaganda
mode this morning somebody says
so update on the find people hoax
many of you have been watching me debunk
that for the last several months
lots of people joined in steve cortez
joel pollock is all over it carpe
dunctum
and tremendous progress i just tweeted
around
joel pollock's article in breitbart uh
detailing how jake tapper
now gives the second part of the quote
and says in clear terms
the president wasn't talking about the
neo-nazis
and the uh white nationalists when he
referred to the fine people
now the hoax is sort of transformed into
well who was he talking about
which actually doesn't matter because
the worst case scenario is that he
thought other people were there
they were not racists well that's either
true
or not true but completely irrelevant
because first of all no one knows who
was there no no complete accounting was
ever done
and if he was wrong on the fact
well he was wrong on the fact that a
reasonable person
would assume was true also it's the same
thing i assumed
i assume a big gathering has a diverse
group and even if it's
dominated by one group or organized by
one group
a lot of other people show up if you
give it enough attention
i just saw there was some kind of audit
by the city in which they did
identify people who were there not
affiliated
with any of the named groups so even the
city has confirmed
that it was a diverse group but we don't
know exactly what they were thinking
anyway so now we've seen in the past
week
uh new york of course the new york times
actually interviewed one of the people
who was not
with the racists and uh just was there
about the statue
and was not racist uh
so it's hard to refute that and
even politifact has included it
with the full quote now but they refuse
to actually
they refuse to actually call the uh the
fine people
thing a lie so they've they've gone full
uh mueller you know everybody criticized
mueller for not making a decision on
obstruction
well politifact just went full mueller
on this fine people hoax and they said
well
why don't we just show it to you in
context you decide this one
their very point the the entire thing
that politifact does
is they give you their opinion
of whether something's a fact or not but
this one time
this one time they've decided not to
give an opinion
they've they've gone full muller why
well it's obvious why
because giving that opinion would be the
second
biggest hoax in political history
after the russia collusion and i'm not
sure that
i'm not sure that the mental health of
the anti-trumpers can handle all that
all that revealing of reality in the
same time zone
so your time frame i guess
so this morning uh jimmy wales
uh founder of wikipedia
retweeted joel pollock's article from
breitbart
now that article article talked about
jake tapper
giving now the full context where before
it was typical for cnn to give just the
first part of the quote which was
misleading about the fine people
and so so the founder of
wikipedia retweets that article
now of course somebody jumps on him and
says jimmy wales
why are you retweeting break art and of
course
the answer is that breitbart
is talking about cnn and it's talking
about both of them
agreeing so you've got a
an outlet identified with the right and
outlet identified with the left
cnn and breitbart and they were on the
same page
on the fact who was the first
major outlet to get
get the fine people hoax correct who was
not
identified with the right answer
wikipedia wikipedia beat
every news outlet on the left
associated with the left to get this
right
and now all the other outlets are
starting to report it in its full
context
so i love the fact that wikipedia
is continually is continually attacked
for
you know bias or whatever
but let's let's call it out let's call
it out
when when they beat the back wikipedia
was the most reliable
outlet that wasn't clearly associated
with politics on the right
they got it first and they got it right
all right so that was interesting
um
so i guess trump said in his rally
speech last night he said quote
now we're sending he's talking about the
illegal immigrants they get rounded up
he said now we're sending many of them
to sanctuary cities
thank you very much he told the crowd in
green bay
uh they ain't so happy about it i'm
proud to tell you that was actually my
sick idea
so trump is actually calling it his own
sick idea
to send them to sanctuary cities now the
question is
is that true now the claim is that
we're sending many of them to sanctuary
cities
that's probably true isn't it it may not
be
any more than they were ever sending to
sanctuary cities before
it might be it might not be but the
claim is that they're sending
people to sanctuary cities and i would
guess
that's probably true meaning that if
they just do business as usual
some of those immigrants are going to
end up in sanctuary cities right
so his claim might be technically true
but it's going to be interpreted a
little bit differently than the
strictly technically true part
president also talked about executing
babies after they're born
now people on social media
came up to me after i was debunking the
charlottesville hoax
and they said to me and i quote scott
why aren't you also
spending all your time in your
whiteboard trying to debunk
this this abortion claim about executing
babies
to which i say i have without the
whiteboard i didn't really need the
whiteboard
but how often if you heard me debunk
that hoax often right
so every time somebody comes after me
and says
aha you are being a hypocrite
because you debunk this but you don't
debunk that
almost always they're wrong almost
always
now so i tweeted this morning cnn's
take on the fact checking of that
comment
and cnn was weirdly ambiguous
uh in their fact check they did fact
check that the
the law he was talking about the
specific law
they say already has a penalty built
into it
for if anybody kills a live viable baby
it's just murder so
so they fact checked the president's
claim as not true
but then they referenced the northam
quote
without fact checking it so the northern
quote was about a different law in a
different state
but for some reason cnn's fact-check
did not go so far as to say and it was
also
untrue when people misinterpreted
northam
they didn't say that they simply showed
it for context
now i had been saying that the northam
thing was a hoax
but i really did expect cnn to back me
up on that
and maybe they have in other places i
haven't looked that hard
but it it just tripped a little flag
it's like wait a minute they're being so
clear about this other state and this
other law
and then they only mention northam
without saying that he also got it wrong
in the same way
if that's the case now i think he was
taken out of context and there were some
assumptions he was making
that are not clear in the video and so
if you only look at the video
it looks exactly as bad as everybody's
saying
but remember if you only looked at the
first part of the charlottesville
fine people quote you would go away
thinking that you'd seen it with your
own eyes
and you couldn't possibly be wrong and
the president
clearly you heard it you saw it called
neo-nazis fine people and then you see
the rest of the quote
and he clarifies i'm totally not talking
about neo-nazis and white nationalists
so if you don't see the second part you
don't see it in context
you would go away saying scott are you
are you freaking crazy
i saw it with my own eyes i heard it
with my own ears
everybody's reporting it how are you
saying that didn't happen
so just remember it's common
it's ordinary it's
universal that people on both sides on a
regular basis
believe they are seeing and hearing
things with their own
senses and therefore cannot be wrong
unfortunately we no longer live in that
era
because videos can and and even
transcripts can be so easily taken out
of context
to turn them into their opposites
so so if you see something that you say
i'm looking at it with my own eyes and
my own ears and
i know that i'm seeing it here's how you
check
to see if you've been duped i suggest
this rule not for this case but for all
cases
and it goes like this if the facts
not the opinions if the facts
are reported the same on left leading
organizations
and right-leaning news organizations
it's almost certainly a fact
if you only see it on one it doesn't
matter which one
just the right or just the left and
again i'm not talking about opinion
i'm talking about a point of fact if you
only see a point of fact
reported on one side
it's a hoax it's a hoax
so ask yourself and i don't know the
answer to this have you ever seen
a left-leaning news organization
say anything that was similar to there
is a law in any state
that allows a doctor and the mother to
decide to let a baby die
that would otherwise be viable and has
already been born
is there any left-leaning site that has
ever said that that's true
as far as i know that's never happened
and i want you to and i want you to
i want you to hold that rule
and keep that in mind every time you see
one of these situations
now remember you're going to see
opinions all over the place
but on the on the point of fact whether
such a law exists
that would allow the mother and the
doctor to literally kill a baby
that would not have otherwise died if
they'd given a care
just ask yourself why nobody reports
that as fact
on on one entire side
now to be fair the fine people
hoax you know it looked like
only the right-leaning organizations
were reporting it as a hoax
and it looked like only the left-leaning
organizations
were reporting it as completely true but
if you crawl through the you know all of
the the links and the articles you'll
find that the
new york times interviewed somebody who
was a fine person
who did not come there for racism came
there about
statues and it's a real person who has a
name and they talked to her and she's
part of a group that were
that felt the same so there was a
left-leaning
organization that reported the fact and
there
there were times when left-leaning
organizations at least once
printed the entirety of trump's
transcript
so there was in fact a very obvious
footprint
on both the left and the right the right
was shouting it a little louder
the left was underplaying it but they
both reported the fact
the fact that there were other fine
people there
confirmed and the fact that the
president
specifically excluded the racist so when
you apply this rule
takes a little skill to know what
actually has been talked about and what
hasn't
but you can suss it down all right
uh so i will leave you that rule
instead of giving you my opinion on
whether the
executing the baby claim is true or a
hoax
just use that rule if you don't like how
it comes out for you on this topic see
how often
um see how often the rule works
for other topics and if you note that
that rule works for
other topics then i would say um
you know give it more credibility all
right
can you be for human rights and be for
abortion yes you can the way everybody
makes their decisions on abortion
is by pretending that the words make the
decision
so abortion is not a logic
argument it's not really a fact-based
argument people try to make it that way
but the entire argument for or against
abortion is that um
i forgot where i was going that the
abortion debate
depends on people uh inserting their own
definition of when
life begins which is an unsolvable
problem
in other words there's no objective way
where we can do an experiment and say
well here's life and you know here's not
life
so the pro-life people say it begins at
conception
and i would say that's a perfectly moral
position
that is a hundred percent morally
appropriate
position that if there's any ambiguity
about when life begins
it's life that's less the most
morally clean position because it allows
that you might even be wrong about
where life begins but as long as there's
ambiguity
morally clean opinion is that you don't
take a chance
maybe it's life maybe it's not now the
people who are on the other side
are not really arguing the the morality
of it
they're arguing sort of a freedom
question
so they're saying that the real question
is who gets
to decide now they don't say it the way
i'm saying it but in essence this is
argument
so the the pro-abortion argument is who
gets to decide
because we live in a world where it's a
decision
somebody has to make a life and death
decision
especially if there's any uh competition
between will the mother have a risk
to her life versus the child somebody
has to make the decision
so the pro-abortion is not
so much we think we want to kill babies
they they try to
they try to define it away from being
life to make the argument easier but
that's not really
the argument the argument is who makes
the decision
and the pro-abortion people are saying
the only reasonable way to do this is
that the mother who clearly has the most
skin in the game
other than the unborn child the mother
can make a decision but a fetus or an
unborn child
can't make a decision the government can
make a decision
or the mother can make a decision
working with the doctor
so the pro-abortion people are weirdly
saying that the government should stay
out of their
their business on this case so
if you're on the anti-abortion side
you have a weird situation in which
you're promoting the government making
decisions
over the individual which is a weird
place to be
if you're conservative i'm not saying
that's right or wrong
i'm not giving you an opinion in any of
this i'm just describing the situation
so there's a there's an incongruity on
the left
in which it they favor a little bit of
government intervention
when normally they would run away from
that
but to be fair murder is already illegal
so i'm sure the people on the right
don't say this is a little extra
extra government involvement they would
say this isn't extra
this is freaking exactly what we do for
adult people
doesn't matter when you became a person
we're just saying
murder is murder in our opinion so
the right interestingly does a terrible
job
of promoting their opinion because
theirs is based on
this is a terrible terrible decision to
make
and somebody has to make it who is it
the only decision you get is who makes
the decision because if you're saying to
yourself
if we let the mother make the decision
under these circumstances if we let the
doctor do it
if you don't let them do it you're
saying that somebody else could do it
better
can they i don't know so this is why i
recuse myself
from an opinion on abortion i recuse
myself because as a man if i weigh in
i'm somewhat in a small way i'm
decreasing
the weight of women's opinion on this
topic
and my philosophical preference is that
since this is basically an impossible in
a possible situation
the way people see the world you know
it's impossible that everybody's going
to be on the same side
the most credible outcome is when women
have a stronger voice in this
just this topic not every topic in the
world but just this topic
the most credible outcome is when women
have a bigger voice
than men and so i recuse myself so in my
small way
i can let that happen all right
uh
yeah you know people are are throwing
their arguments at me do
do fathers have skin in the game and you
can argue yes
obviously less than the mother does do
they have financial
interests yes can the financial interest
be a
separate decision from the life or death
abortion decision yes
you know the if you're asking me about
the financial part
then i think men certainly have to have
a role in that lawmaking and opinion
making
but not on the life and death decision i
think
and by the way i'm not telling any of
the men
listening to this that you should recuse
that's your own decision
you live in a free country you don't
have to recuse from anything
i'm just telling you that my ethical and
moral
stand is that i need to recuse
because i just think that's a more
credible outcome
all right i guess we have to talk about
this
latest uh synagogue shooter
uh clearly at this point we're seeing
copycats
now the news is going to report
that the copycats are coming from
i don't know president trump's rhetoric
or something
and it's going to be crazy because
of course israel loves trump etc
and and the the only people painting
trump as a white supremacist
is the media you know the the fine
people hoax being the
the alpha hoax supporting all the other
hoaxes
and so the media really has to take the
hit
for this latest shooting in my opinion
if you you know for anything to happen
in this world
all of the variables that supported that
thing happening had to be present
so i always argue that it's never this
one thing that caused the bad thing it's
it's everything you have to have
everything
for the bad thing to happen but one of
the everything's
is that the media makes heroes and makes
makes famous these people and gives them
the idea
gives them the idea and
if and they also at the same time that
the media is
giving all these nuts the idea that hey
shooting up a place of worship i guess
i'll get a lot of attention
and they'll all be there and i'll make a
big statement because it's you know
there's more energy to it because it's a
place of worship that will get everybody
you know twice as excited as if it
weren't
so who who gets who gets the nuts
thinking about doing that it's the media
they choose to cover these stories in a
way
that's guaranteed to make more of these
stories
i predicted back in
[Music]
1997 or something in my book the dilbert
future
i said that the the probable
place that these press would end up
is killing people to create news
and that's actually what's happening so
the the news industry because of the
business model the mo
the news there are certain topics that
they can get more attention to which
gives them more money
and if they run out of things that are
happening naturally
if there are not enough disasters not
enough tragedies
i predicted that they would start
manufacturing
their own strategies or their own
tragedies
so that the news business would have
fodder
now it may not be a decision to do that
they may not sit around the boardroom
and say hey who can we kill
but by their collective actions and what
they care about
and don't care about they've created a
clear situation
in which they've guaranteed there will
be a continuous string
of more of these copy calculators
because it's all the headlines
if they had decided
if if the media had collectively decided
to um here's how i would
suggest covering these we should not
ignore them
we should run the story that says
there was a tragedy at this place maybe
the basic facts
for injury is too dead and then
i would recommend that everybody have
some website
that is completely sanitized of anything
interesting
such as the shooter's name
and they just link to it and then every
if you're on the right or the left
you're on social media no matter who you
are
you just link to the same one page that
has nothing but the barest of facts
there was a shooting x people got killed
the shooter is in custody boom nothing
else
because when as soon as you go beyond
that and you give it this extra
importance because
and let's be i hate to be
sound cold about this it was a terrible
tragedy it's like the last thing that we
would ever want but
the the truth is
that while we were talking about these
four victims of this
tragedy probably
a hundred people died in automobile
accidents
you know they're probably way more
people than that
were shot in chicago but because they
were onesies
you know and they they were acts of
passion or crimes or whatever and we're
just used to them
they're not really news they need to be
they need to be packaged the way this
latest synagogue shooting was sort of
packaged
hey it's got multiple victims it
connects to the headlines and racism
and you know it connects to israel it's
it just connects to all of our
other things we're thinking about so
it's the news industry that decides
whether or not there will be copycats
and
by their actions the news industry has
made the decision
they've decided that there will be more
of this
that's a conscious decision now
that's probably not the way they process
it the way they process it is this
is the news of course we cover the news
where the news
you know if the other if the other side
is going to cover it we have to
we have to cover the news imagine how
we'd look
if this thing happened and then we
didn't talk about it we would look like
the people who didn't care about
you know jews because like why are you
downplaying this
when there are some victims so you can
imagine that the news industry has their
reasons their rationalizations for
why they have to cover it but let me ask
you
as as a public service did it make you
safer or less safe you as a citizen
watching this periscope
because the news covered it as
thoroughly as they have
is that making you safer or less safe
i don't think there's any question about
it it didn't make you safer
it definitely made you less safe because
it's giving another
another crop of idiots and mentally
insane people a bunch of ideas
they're all getting the ideas like okay
it's an ar
place of worship got it
yeah they're basically giving the recipe
for more of these
so i don't know maybe maybe the news
industry could
get together and instead of patting
themselves up
on the back at the correspondence dinner
which by the way i watched a little of
that correspondence
dinner and also uh cnn
before that don lemon actually said on
live television
so i guess he had to borrow some clothes
from jake tapper to go on air
because of the tragedy he was he was in
town to
do the correspondence dinner but
you know they they put him on the air
because of the tragedy
and he actually complained that the
tragedy happened
on his his big night that he had it that
they had this event
the correspondence dinner you know
like like that was the problem yeah the
problem is
it ruined don lemon's night he had to
work on the night that he wanted to
go enjoy himself at this event and i
thought
my god that might be one of the worst
things i've ever heard on television
now i'm not the outrage monster so i
don't think that's
worthy of outrage people people who talk
on television for a living are going to
say
things imperfectly trump does it don
lemon did it
but it was jarring to hear it that's
i'll just stop there i'll just say it
was jarring to hear it
no apologies are needed uh speaking of
apologies the
new york times has apologized
for their international edition now the
international edition
would have different editors and you
know different management
but apparently the international not
apparently the international edition
ran a comic of trump wearing a little
yamaka and walking at a wiener dog
with netanyahu's face on it that was
supposed to represent israel and
the moment you see it if you've lived in
the world for very long
especially in this country the moment
you see that cartoon
you go what the
and i think wtf was probably the most
common response to it
people looked at it and said i don't
know what i'm seeing here
are they really running a gigantic
anti-semitic
comic in the new york times
international
edition now to their credit
the you know the parent company new york
times
when they saw the blowback they removed
the comic
they said it was an error in judgment
and the the entity that provided them
that comic
um they uh
they deleted it now of course people
piled on and said where's my apology
yeah that's not an apology you're just
saying it's an error
an error of judgment and then that you
corrected it
now i'm not the person who was offended
personally
i i feel like the only people who could
accept the apology if you even want to
call it that
because it wasn't quite framed as an
apology but the only the only people who
could or should consider accepting that
as a good response
would be the jewish community
but i would have to say if i were
looking at the situation
that the new york times has met my
personal standard for
good citizenship if we judge the new
york times by the mistake
instead of the capable adjustment
and you know correction to the mistake
i think that's not the world you want to
live in i think you have to let people
correct their mistakes
and then say okay you know i i see you
understand the mistake
the moment you understood it you fixed
it
and you said what you did you were
transparent you were quick
you did the only thing that could be
done
i i'm going to say the new york times
gets um
gets an a for the correction
now if you are a member of the jewish
community and you feel that
more is needed in the way of an apology
i would say that that would be up to you
but as just an observer from the outside
if anybody can meet that standard in
this world
i made a mistake bam i realize it now i
corrected it and i just told people who
care
what i did about it if you can do that
i'm gonna be okay with you about this
yeah i called the 48 hour rule for
correction and they were well within the
48 hours
they were well within 24 hours i think
so i love to make fun of my new york
times
as some of you do but i'm not going to
make fun of them
for making a mistake which they capably
and quickly corrected that's just not a
standard
i want to live with um
yeah so somebody's saying what were the
tropes
uh in other words what was it about the
cartoon
that made it anti-semitic it's an
interesting question
because i don't know
i don't know i mean i looked at it and
i could feel the anti-semitism
i could feel it it you know from just
a perceptual sense it looked
obviously offensive i never would have
you know
green lit that kind of comic but if you
ask me what's the exact element
that makes this anti-semitic i'd say
i'm not really the expert on that but it
is true that a lot of people
took it that way it must also be true
it must also be true that the people who
originally
gave the green light to run that
probably didn't see it
it wasn't obvious to them i i think that
people can be blind to things that other
people don't
let me give you one rule that really
helps you in life
one of the biggest problems we all make
and we all do is that we assume that
other people are starting with the same
set of knowledge and have the same
filter on life that we do
so when they make a decision that's not
the one we make
we just we start imagining all kinds of
reasons why they're making it oh they're
lying they're
they're stupid and all those things but
indeed people have different starting
places let me give you my best example
do you remember when ron desantis who
was governor now of florida when he was
running he referred to his
opponent who was african-american
gentleman
he referred to him as articulate
when he did that um social media and the
regular news blew up and said my god
it's a
it's a racist dog whistle because
everyone knows
that you don't call a black person
articulate
because that's a historically that's a
well-known
backwards insult right it's a backwards
insult
everybody knows that so if ron desantis
uses this term that
everybody knows is an insult to black
people well must be intentional
now somebody in the comments is getting
ahead of me it is also true
that joe biden is on record referring to
i don't know who he was referring to oh
obama i think and he called them uh
he called them articulate right he
called obama articulate
now one of the things i would say about
obama
if i did not already know that this word
has
has this double meaning if i didn't know
the double meaning
i would say that's actually a pretty
good description of
obama he's in one articulate mofo
right now if you never knew that saying
articulate
was considered an insult by the vast
majority of people
you could easily fall into that because
it does fit
and if you don't know the second meaning
it's just a compliment
so biden did it desantis did it
they both did it in public
they weren't hiding anything in public
now what is the more likely explanation
of why both of those experienced
politicians did that in public
the most likely explanation is that
they didn't realize it would sound that
way that the second meaning
just didn't occur to them by far that's
the most likely explanation
it really stretches imagination that
they were cleverly
using a a dog whistle that literally
everybody in the the news media
recognizes as a dog whistle
you don't use a secret racist dog
whistle that
everyone can see let me let me show you
the difference
if you wanted to send a secret dog
racist dog whistle
it would look like this
see that's secret i'm i'm not trying to
make you see it
here's what it looks like if you're not
trying to send it as a secret
tweet tweet look at me over here tweet
tweet everybody you got the camera get
the camera on here tweet
tweet okay that's not a secret
so the very minimum requirement for
sending a clever secret racist dog
whistle if such things exist
is you don't do it in a way that
literally everybody's gonna see
so it's the least likely explanation
that it was a clever trick
i'm gonna use these words and only the
special people that i'm trying to get
will understand it all the rest of the
media they'll never know
they'll never know they can't see this
it's invisible
it's invisible okay maybe
now you can't rule things out right
because we're not mind readers
maybe that's exactly what both biden
and desantis did maybe they are so dumb
that they don't know that their secret
racist dog whistle is the most
famous obvious unambiguously racist
sounding thing that anybody ever said
i mean it's right up there with the
n-word as far as
you should know you know if you've lived
in the world
you should know that's an insult
so anyway my main point is that we are
so often
amazed that educated experienced people
have a blind spot but it's the most
universal thing in the world
people do have a blind spot
now somebody's saying that it's
subconscious
i'm not buying the idea of subconscious
uh bigotry
not that it doesn't exist because of
course it does so when i say i'm not
buying it i'm not doubting its existence
of course it exists we all we're all
subconscious monsters
and we're doing the best we can to fight
it but
as a standard for society we really need
to judge people
by how our executive brain
manages our monsters right
if we judged each other by what our
inner thoughts are
if we judge them each other by what we
believe are other people's subconscious
feelings you don't want to live in that
world
you do not want to live in a world where
it
makes sense and people say yeah let's
yeah i could tell by the choice of words
that he's got terrible thoughts so i'm
going to judge him by
the terrible thoughts that i believe he
has
even though i can't tell when people
have legitimate
you know they're giving a tell for their
subconscious thoughts versus they just
don't know it sounds wrong
because that would look exactly alike so
don't let yourself live in a world
where you imagine you can judge people's
inner thoughts
you have to judge people by what they do
and even by what they say you you've got
to give them
a chance to clarify if it sounded wrong
the first time
so the 48-hour rule works well with this
the 48-hour rule is that
i give everybody 48 hours to either
apologize or clarify
if they've said something accidentally
provocative
and uh i think that's a good rule and
you should you should ignore what you
imagine people are thinking it's just
not the
it's just not the world you want to live
in
all right um
has biden apologized for his hoax video
yet
now so what we what we see is that
for last several days i think most of
you have seen this
you've seen that the people who believed
the original
hoax that the president called the
neo-nazis and the white nationalists
fine people as soon as it's proven to be
a hoax because you can look at the
transcript and you can see he said
we i condemn totally those groups uh
they usually retreat
to a weaker position it's like well it
was organized
by nazis so you know there's no
ambiguity it was organized by
racists but
nobody's really saying the organizers
were the only ones who showed up
it was a well-publicized event and it
turns out we have
evidence um you know from the new york
times interviewing etc
eyewitnesses i've even talked to
somebody who was there who was not a
racist
and so we have plenty of reason to
believe
that there were people besides the nazis
who came even though it was organized by
nazis
now you can say to yourself why in the
world
would anybody go to an event after
seeing that
poster and it gets to the the articulate
question
i i convinced myself after a long
conversation
with somebody who did not see that
poster as being as evil as it is
i convince myself that not everybody
sees it's the same
it's a it's a yawning and laurel thing
and specifically
the way that they saw it differently is
they didn't really recognize that the
design
as being something that would you should
have raised a flag you know just by its
design
elements but also didn't recognize all
the names
so there were names of speakers speakers
and if you only recognize one of them as
a racist
you might have said to yourself as this
person did oh i thought it was one of
these free speech things
where it doesn't matter how bad you are
you still get to speak
and then the assumption being that not
everybody is a racist
but there was one in in the mix now
i don't agree with that assumption at
all and i didn't have
anything like that kind of impression
when i looked at the poster
but i do understand i live in a world of
you know yani and laurel
where people can literally look at the
same thing right in front of them and
see two different worlds
so we know that to be true and we know
that people make decisions for
all kinds of crazy reasons that we can't
even imagine
in fact i would go so far as to say the
the most likely explanation for anything
you see
in terms of a decision to make some
somebody makes
the most likely explanation is always
the thing you didn't imagine now the
thing you didn't imagine
is you know the grab bag for all of the
things you don't imagine
but how many times have you had a
situation where you said
well there's only one thing that can
explain this set of events
and then you find out that the the
reality is just completely different
from the one thing you thought was the
only thing that could explain it
because you hadn't imagined there was
could be this weird other explanation
you just couldn't imagine it so
sometimes we confuse
our inability to imagine alternative
explanations
with the fact that this must be true
sometimes
it's just a lack of imagination i would
guess that any group of 100 americans
gathered in any place for any reason
another or
any event without any reason but if you
put any
group of 100 americans you will have a
lot of different opinions
even if they came for the same event
you're gonna get a lot of nuance
that's just guaranteed so that's all i
got for now
i will talk to you more tomorrow
