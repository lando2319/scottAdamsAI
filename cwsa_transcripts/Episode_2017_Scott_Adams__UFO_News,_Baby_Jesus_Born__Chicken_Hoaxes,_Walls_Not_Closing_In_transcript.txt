dude
good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams which is the
highlight of civilization
and today we've got some of the most
interesting stories of all time
none of them are true
but I think you're used to that so if
you'd like to get ready
for the fake news of the century the
fake news pelosa
is that something fake news pelosa it's
the Cornucopia of fake news and it's all
here today and if you'd like to enjoy it
to its maximum potential all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
jealous of ironic and theme yoga flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better and today today only
a little hint of oxytocin just a little
bit see if you can detect it
yeah I got it there's one note of
oxytocin in there today
but the dopamine is Sublime as usual
well I don't know if you caught it but
the biggest story of the day
is that a uh Japanese Zoo reports that
they have a female Gibbon
that has given birth despite living in
isolation for two years
so there were no boy Gibbons anywhere to
be seen for two years and yet the female
Gibbon
is pregnant
now
this could mean one of two things
number one it's a good thing I'm not an
employee of that Zoo
okay we all agree it's a good thing I'm
not an employee of the zoo they had the
Gibbon they had the baby with Anthony
Boya Gibbons because
I'm the kind of
who would be mercilessly mocking the
zookeeper
so uh
you got that female Gibbon in there
she's looking got out
they tell me that no male Gibbons have
been in there for two years
two years seems there's only one person
who has the key
uh Bob Bob you're the only person who's
been in that Gibbon habitat
and
I'm just saying maybe you and the Gibbon
got a little busy
right now okay that you know that didn't
happen
but you know if I work there I would be
mercily mercilessly mocking Bob
for having access to the given
can we agree on that it's a good thing I
don't work there okay let's agree on
that the second thing is
I think we're missing the significance
because
I only know one case in history in which
a primate had an Immaculate Conception
so there's at least a possibility
the baby Jesus has returned
but maybe was being a little bit more
modest than the last time
now you don't think of Jesus as like a
bragger right
am I right Jesus was not like oh look at
my Rolex
and Jesus could have had to Rolex he had
powers
um but no Jesus is humble if there's
anything we know Jesus is not a show-off
and I think it would be just like him
to come back as a baby Gibbon
because that would put everything in
perspective you'd be like oh we're
humans we're so special then Jesus would
come back and say oh not so special
I I'm a gibbon
and I'm Jesus
you're like not even that so I think it
would be a good lesson for humankind
now just so you know a gibbon is not a
monkey
so some of you are attempted to say oh
it's monkey Jesus that's that's first of
all that would be disrespectful second
of all it would be technically incorrect
it is a gibbon and a gibbon I looked it
up there not one of the great apes
not a great hip again totally consistent
with Jesus's personality Jesus isn't
going to come back as like a great ape
that would be not very modest would it
oh I'm the great ape look at me I came
back as a great ape no that would be so
so not in keeping with the whole vibe
instead there's at least a possibility
that he chose What's called the lesser
apes
the Gibbons are small compared to the
the great apes so they're called the
lesser apes
I think that's perfect
I feel like that's right on brand it's
like not too Shelly
but
still making a point it makes a point
without being too showy
so I think at the exact time that the uh
the space aliens are attacking earth uh
baby given Jesus may have come back we
don't know this this is not confirmed
but possibly possibly and would be
we're hoping
we're hoping baby Gibb and Jesus is on
our side
because if baby given Jesus is on the
alien Invader side
it's going to be harder than we thought
and Joe Biden will tell you you're going
to need more than your AR-15 for that
huh you're going to need more than your
AR-15 for that
let's talk about chickens uh not laying
eggs
if anybody if any of you heard that
chickens stopped laying eggs because
there's something in their feed
that makes them non-egg layers
well
uh I will I would ask you to Google
chickens not laying eggs
and then the word debunked
[Laughter]
because
it looks like chickens are leg eggs but
they're always sometimes when some
individual groups of chickens will not
be laying eggs and individual Farms
could have you know a variety of
problems that are unique to the farm so
it's not that unusual
if one Farm has chickens that are not
lay eggs
it would be very unusual if they were
all not laying eggs but apparently
that's not not the point
apparently that's not happening so don't
worry about
your chicken eggs price is high but
they're plenty of them
uh Wall Street Journal reports that the
government started getting smart
I know
you're not going to believe this story
this will be wild
you did not see this coming this is out
of left field people it could be again
related to Baby given Jesus or possibly
the Alien Invasion because this is not
normal behavior
all right listen to this the government
did this our actual government the U.S
government
uh Wall Street Journal reports that the
Biden Administration has started
approving State requests
to use Medicaid to pay for groceries and
nutritional counseling
it turns out that our government has
discovered
and I think it's true
that what you eat is related to your
health
has anybody heard that before
this is brand new information what you
eat and how much of it could have an
impact on your health
no no seriously I'm not kidding stop it
stop doubting me it's true it's a true
fact
and what's more amazing than that
if that were not amazing enough
the U.S government
apparently is acting
rationally
and I don't know preliminarily it looks
like it's in the interest of the public
like I don't want to get ahead of myself
but it looks like they did something
smart that's good for us
I okay I screw it yeah I don't believe
it either yeah they'll find some way to
take it back but for a moment there
I I felt this little tinge of
government competence it was like
thrilling it like went through me like a
like a chill well Goosebumps Goosebumps
just the thought that the government
would make a good decision wow but
probably not I'm sure they'll find it
some way there screw that up
um here's an amazing thing that happened
on CNN today in a opinion piece by
someone who's not a normal CNN
contributor I'm not saying that the
person is not normal
I'm saying not routinely a contributor
to CNN which is important to the story
it's a Jennifer Rogers former former
Federal prosecutor is arguing that the
walls are not closing in on Trump
did you ever think you would see that
there's an opinion piece on CNN website
whose only point
there's like one point of view it's not
like two points of view showing both
sides is one point of view
that says the walls are not closing in
on Trump and that some recent things
with uh I guess the the old prosecutor
for Manhattan
they're I guess they're the ones that
are following up in the Stormy Daniels
payment that that BS story
not BS in terms of it not being true but
BS in terms of nobody cares
nobody cares
there's not there's not a single person
in the whole world who cares if Trump
did or did not use campaign funds to pay
off Stormy Daniels
zero people care but
apparently the the prior prosecutor
wrote a book
and in the book he gives away a little
bit more information than a prosecutor
ought to be giving away
so it makes it a little bit easier for
the defense
to know exactly what the worst
prosecutor was thinking in terms of what
the case would look like which is just a
present to the defense but it also
showed that they seem to be wildly
interested in just getting Trump
which is a real gift to the to the
defense so
I don't know the the big story here is
not Trump's legal dilemma because I
think that was always trivial what's
different is the CNN is going out of the
way to say that is Trivial and that that
he's moving in the direction of less
risk not more I've never seen that
before have you
have you ever seen CNN write a story
with no hedging there's no hedging to it
whatsoever it just says looks like looks
like things are going his way
it's different right yeah and I I like
the fact that the public is being brutal
on CNN
because I believe CNN could be a
valuable asset to the country
and I I think they had been in the past
you know they they certainly went
useless at some point
but I'd love to see them rehabilitated
I'd love to know that the news you know
was real for its age
so we'll see how many of you have
forgotten the Durham investigation that
was supposed to be uh the walls closing
in on I don't know who Democrats in the
Department of Justice and the FBI and
Hillary Clinton and everybody associated
with her and then basically they got
kind of nothing
um do you think that's because there was
nothing there and you we all got excited
and there was never anything there
so here's what I think
I think that the Durham investigation
was looking for crime
and if your conspiracy involved just
hypothetically just hypothetically if a
conspiracy involved people at the
Department of Justice
the FBI
lawyers
and had Democrats who mostly are lawyers
do you think they couldn't figure out a
way to do a plot without breaking any
laws
I feel like that would be easy
just don't write anything down in an
email that's clearly illegal
and just have all your conversations
privately and then everybody does things
which individually look like they could
have been explained by one individual
doing something they thought was the
right thing to do
that's all it would take
so I'm not sure that the Durham
investigation tells you anything
about what did or did not happen the
only thing that it does tell you is it
was not something overtly and easily
identifiable
that was illegal
so yeah and all those conversations with
super sketchy text
stuff that's super sketchy
but I think it falls short of being
obviously Criminal
meaning that if there's at least one
other interpretation that's all you need
you only need one other interpretation
of the facts and you're you're free
that's the whole story
so when they say stuff like
um you know something is an insurance
policy
that could be an indication that that
person had bias
which is not illegal
is it
is it illegal to be a human being with
bias
as long as what you're doing is your job
no it's not it's not illegal to have
bias it's illegal to act in a biased
manner
but it's not illegal to have bias
so they would have to find that they did
something that was very non-standard and
bordered on illegal to have anything so
so I don't know that Durham finding
nothing means there's nothing there it
might mean there was nothing illegal or
nothing easily found it was illegal well
let's talk about those UFOs
uh the funniest meme I saw in the UFO
hysteria is an alien talking to another
one
and one alien says can we land yet and
the other alien says no it's too early
at the moment they're trying to change
the weather by eating bugs
we are kind of we are kind of doing that
aren't we
isn't that sort of exactly what we're
doing
I I believe that's actually the literal
idea on the table
to eat bugs to change the weather
what's funny about it is that it's
technically true it's technically true
we're trying to eat bugs to change the
weather
that's a funny meme
all right what else about this Hysteria
um the the thing I'm waiting for is when
the alien leader has to meet our leader
and the only thing we can hope is that
the advanced intelligence of this alien
civilization
I hope they have a sense of humor
because when we show them Biden they're
going to talk to him for five minutes
and then they're going to turn to us and
say
okay you're you're joking right
no seriously that was a pretty good one
you got us we we traveled from Alpha
Centauri and that was one of the best
pranks we've seen we almost believed
that was your leader no seriously
seriously show us the real one
I you know honestly our Universal
translator isn't even working on this
guy
I mean I'm looking at the universal
translator he talked and I think he said
uh we're going to focus on the uh
we don't even know what that means this
is a universal translator Universal
it doesn't work on this guy that you're
pretending he's your leader we don't
know what he's saying it seems like some
kind of Mumble talk we don't know
so that that could not go well perhaps
anyway
um so we got an unidentified object shot
down over Canada
uh one shot down over Alaska another one
shot down over our warmer waters on the
south in the southeast
so now we've got three objects one
definitely a Chinese uh spy balloon
or not who knows and then two things
that are mysterious one of them might
bend a giant tube with no people and no
uh guidance system how do you know there
are no people in it
if if you saw a
giant metallic tube
flying at forty thousand feet with no
windows there's no windows
how would you know
there were no people in it
or aliens how would you know there's no
aliens in there
what mechanism do we have to know what's
inside the big tube
or Gibbons or Gibbons
yeah I don't know I feel like when they
say it's unmanned
they either know it's a balloon
because if they knew it were if they
know it's a balloon then they could
reasonably Intuit there's nothing inside
it
right depending on the size of the
balloon and where it is and everything
uh there's no exhaust
so if I were to build an inter let's say
interplanetary Wormhole traveling
spaceship would it have Windows
and would aliens necessarily need to
look at things
maybe aliens have a different type of
sensing way of sensing their environment
maybe they don't need to look at stuff
with eyeballs so they wouldn't need any
windows
nor would they need any uh external
propulsion signs like smoke coming out
of the engine or anything like that
because my God they just traveled
interplanetary through a wormhole you
don't need a gas engine for that or even
nuclear
so uh
I don't believe that any aliens have
visited us
but I have questions number one
why did the U.S shoot down an object
over Canadian airspace
now it's reported that we were
coordinating with the Canadian
government
but
why do we shoot things down over Canada
even with permission
is that because Canada doesn't have
any Air Force they can shoot down a
balloon
now I get I get that you know NORAD is
up there and they saw it and blah blah
blah blah but and I get that and I get
that we have better
military assets perhaps maybe
NORAD is joint U.S Canada
it is
NORAD is joint U.S Canada well NORAD is
just the monitoring right but when you
put the actual jet up
I'm just wondering why would Trudeau
allow a an American pilot to save Canada
if Canada has Pilots
and missiles
what's behind that
he requested that
the here's my theory
um as you know Trudeau only looks for
opportunities
where he can look weak
am I right
the Trudeau is always looking for a way
to look weak and feminine
the the best way that Canada could look
weak and feminine is to say oh oh could
you help us with this this UFO
we don't we don't think we could handle
it with her oh we have Jess yeah yeah we
have Jen but could you handle this and
maybe maybe you could do this one how
about you do this one oh you do this one
we'll do the next one you do this one
I feel like it was the most feminine
thing Canada could do
to ask for help from the big strong
neighbor oh could you lift this
oh we could do it oh yeah we could do it
ourselves but we'd have to stand on a
chair
could you do it you look so big and
strong
how would you like to be a Canadian
today
how would you like to be male and
Canadian today
and not not feeling so strong today are
you
I'm sorry Canada we love Canada
but uh your leaders
you said he's fun to mock
all right uh what else is going on
um you may have done what I did which is
click on the UFO links on Twitter today
did you see how many UFO sightings there
are according to Twitter
now I recognize some of them are being
you know old ones and they look like
hoaxes and stuff
um so here's the thing I can guarantee
you
95 of everything you see on these UFO
stories is just made up
would you agree
whatever whatever is true I don't know
but at a minimum at a minimum 95 of
everything you see is just made up
so if you see a picture of a UFO if you
see a video and even if it looks like it
was taken from the space shuttle and
even if it looks like there's a ship
landing on the moon which we saw this
morning no matter what you see there's a
95 chance it's not true no matter the
source no matter the source now I'm
allowing five percent
which is pretty big
if you're talking about you know aliens
visiting the Earth five percent is
really big I'm just allowing that you
know anything's possible
anything is possible so I'm not going to
rule it out
but I wouldn't believe any of the
pictures
so don't believe any videos or any
pictures that would be my advice
all right
um
so now there are still pictures of
cylinders flying everywhere
now unfortunately a cylindrical tube is
the easiest thing to fake if you're
going to do like Photoshop or a fake
video
yeah I'm trusting the experts again
exactly
um
so anyway uh let me uh
[Music]
let me ask the audience how many of you
believe literally
that space aliens are here
go how many of you believe it like just
say yes I believe these are actual space
aliens
oh it's all nice I saw one yes
they're on the way all right a few yeses
but mostly no's all right that's good
that's good
you know what imagine if we had not
experienced five straight years of
nothing but fake news
if you had not been trained and primed
by fake news of every type
would you be more likely to think there
was an alien invasion
I I feel like I feel I feel like we were
protected by fake news
the fake News accident acted as a what's
the word I'm going to use
fill in my word
because we had so much fake news we were
primed and let's say protected
from let's say thoughts of a massive
area of UFOs invading
a vaccine that's right fake news acted
as a vaccine
so that almost all of you don't believe
there's an alien invasion
that's a real thing
just think about that for a moment
if you had not been primed by five years
of fake news just obviously fake news
you might have actually believed this
was nearly an invasion
but now you're all you're all uh so
uh Battle of war and experienced that
you know just because it's in the news
and just because you saw a video and
just before you because you saw a
picture and just because it because you
saw incredible people talking to you on
TV that doesn't mean anything
in 2023 what is the news value of a
credible person tell you something
happened that you can't verify
zero
zero
zero it doesn't matter how credible they
are because everybody's lying on TV
every side every issue everybody's lying
on TV
so
it's kind of good that I think I think
the public is treating the the UFO
stories and the balloon stories I think
we're treating it as pure entertainment
which is exactly how we should treat it
am I right
when I look at the UFO stuff I don't see
this news per se I see it as just
entertainment I don't think it has any
any impact on anything
I think that probably there have always
been balloon-like things floating around
up there
and countries are now just shooting them
down to look tough or in the case of
Canada they're asking their big manly
neighbor to shoot it down so that they
can remain feminine
and by the way that that is what's
happening in Canada am I right
Mexico is becoming more male
Canada is becoming more female in
Attitude not gender
and the United States is in the middle
and we're being like rocked by both of
those things
it's true
Mexico is your dad
Canada is your mom
and America is trying to figure it out
like like the two or three confused
children of those two parents
that's what it feels like
all right so don't believe anything on
Aliens
um do you believe that there's a I don't
know another country threat
Eric Wright says for 25 on his Super
Chat he says looks to me like operations
space boater is going way better than
China was expecting
well
I don't know what it all means
but do you remember when
um Jesus was born they were
there was like a North star and then the
Three Wise Men followed it
and they knew that the star was a sign
that you know the Lord would be born
but just before this uh baby Gibbon had
its Immaculate Conception
in the sky we were talking about two
things one thing shaped like a big egg
the Chinese spy balloon shaped like a
big egg and the other thing shaped like
a big penis
so in the sky three wise men I have to
be at least one of them are there two
other wise men to join me and we'll open
it to wise non-binaries too women you
could be wise women and wise
non-binaries uh anything you like
uh but I I saw the signs I saw the big
egg in the sky and the big penis and I
knew
that baby Gibbon Jesus was being born in
a Japanese Zoo
that's how I knew it was sort of obvious
if you put the pieces together
all right my ongoing uh conversation uh
indirectly with Brett Weinstein and
Heather heyer continues I think they
they mentioned something on their
podcast I haven't heard it yet
but somebody was uh arguing their side
and said that the fact that some people
can consistently win at poker
is evidence
that Brett Weinstein could figure out
what was right or what was wrong about
you know vaccinations in the pandemic
because
it's possible to consistently win a
poker but only some people
so if some people can consistently win a
poker therefore logically some people
could do what Brett and Heather did
but not everybody because not everybody
can win a poker but some people can do
it consistently which shows they have a
method right if you can do it
consistently and it's predictable that
means you have a method
so if Brett can do his thing
consistently that would be a method and
therefore the poker thing
proves the point
how many people accept that strong point
strong point
John says good point
Scott always mispronounces names that's
true
Weinstein and Weinstein I will never I
promise you I'll never get them straight
and that's on me that's on me but I I
know my limitations
um
statistics are a thing right
all right so here's the real answer
poker is an analogy
there's no logic there
there's no logic whatsoever it's just a
story that reminds you of another story
that's all that is it's a story that
reminds you of another story in some way
there's no logic connection at all now
let me tell you why this the poker
analogy doesn't fit
had it been a good analogy
then it wouldn't matter that it was
about poker or anything else a good
analogy might have actually moved the
common move things forward here's what's
wrong with the analogy
poker is a bounded game
with rules there are just so many things
you can do in poker and that's the only
things you can do you cannot do anything
but what the game allows you to do
now when you're looking at a bounded set
of possibilities it is quite possible
that somebody could figure out a towel
or a pattern in which this bounded set
of possibilities always operates you
know a certain way let's say on average
however the real world is not a bounded
game the real world has infinite
possibilities
so if you compare something where
somebody could conquer a limited set of
possibilities you have said absolutely
nothing
about the real world with unlimited
possibilities
in fact you've proven that the only
place you can do it is where the
possibilities are bounded
that's actually Opera that actually
works against the point
if the point is I can do things in this
this domain when there's infinite
possibilities and new information that
could come in ETC you can't compare them
all right so if you fell for that if
when I first described it you said to
yourself that's a good point
some poker players can win so therefore
maybe Brett has those skills he's just
applied them in a different domain if
you if you bought that
I hope you learned something
never compare a bounded set of options
to an infinite set of options it's a
it's a real basic comparison mistake
now I tell you over and over again that
my skill
you know that I learned in two college
courses I know you hate you hate it when
I say that
but it is how to compare things
like I've learned and had jobs in which
my only job was to compare the correct
two things
so when I tell you that I see people in
the wild
comparing the wrong things I'm the
expert
so if I see a scientist comparing two
things that are obviously the wrong
things to compare
I I'm the expert
I'm the expert not not the person who
made the wrong comparison
for example
some people said I looked at the risk of
the vaccines and made my decision
anybody who understands decision making
knows that that was an irrational
process
because what you have to compare it to
is the other risks and those were
unknown
right
all right
um
so that happened
how many of you are bored at uh CGI
movies because they all start looking
the same
do you remember that when you saw Star
Wars for the first time if you're old
enough to have remembered that when Star
Wars was brand new the very first one
it was just mind-boggling
you know your eyes never shot you're
like oh how'd they do that
and then it got better and better until
you know it was Iron Man and all the
Marvel stuff and the first Iron Man was
pretty amazing
first you know the first Superman movies
pretty good
pretty good but now if I watch a
superhero movie I watched uh Black Adam
recently I'm watching it I think is an
exaggeration I sort of had it on while I
was doing something else and it was
unwatchable
the CGI was I guess amazing
but it started to look like every other
movie all right there's a guy in a tight
costume and he put his hand out and some
stuff came from his hand and made that
thing blow up again
right so I can't I don't even watch when
I you know if I try to watch a action
movie I fast forward through the CGI do
you do that
I fast forward through all the action
because it's just boring it looks like
every other movie I've seen and then I
get to the maybe a dialogue
but if it's a dialogue where it's two
characters who are trying to act
romantically interested fast forward
because there's nothing worse than the
movie trying to convince you that the
two people love each other so that
you'll feel extra bad when one of them
dies or is in danger
and I think no I don't want to feel
extra bad I don't I don't want to be
invested in that character fast forward
let's just see the funny jokes and then
I'll go to the dialogue where the you
know the the hero is just saying clever
retorts and I'll go oh that was good
clever retort I could watch that
but here's where this is all going it's
not about movies
um as you know AI can make art and it
can do it instantly and in my opinion
it's already way better than humans not
even close in my opinion now remember
I'm an artist
sort of
sort of I'm kind of kind of almost an
artist
cartoonist that counts a little bit
a little bit and in my opinion AI art is
already better than a human aren't by
far
uh
and here's what's going to happen it's
going to go the way of CGI
when I when I looked at examples of AI
art
the first time I saw it I was like whoa
just like I did the first time I saw CGI
wow
that is amazing second time same thing
100th Time same thing
but already
it's starting to look
like not special
because once you've seen your thousandth
really really good AI art
it just looks like things are supposed
to look like that if you could make
something that looks like that why isn't
everybody doing it it's free it's
instant
so I think we're getting to the point
where visual art
and I'm going to go further
all art will become meaningless very
quickly
probably 10 years but maybe five
because movies are no longer interesting
and it's going to go the same way
now now somebody gave me an analogy with
us and as I said analogies are useless
somebody said well the radio didn't go
away when television came in no
radio and television were very small
addition to our our mental load
like it was just something you you made
a point to look at it once in a while so
it was always like an exception and
special and stuff like that so radio was
still a special TV was special but you
didn't get too much of either one
even if you watched a few hours a day
you didn't get that much of either one
but AI will just be everywhere
like every piece of art every piece of
entertainment it'll just be AI created
and better than anything that humans can
make eventually not yet but eventually
and you will just get bored
because every everything will be
excellent
the the reason that art
is you know special
is because it's rare
the reason human or a specialist as rare
but as soon as uh AI can make as much as
you want for free it's not rare and
you're going to see it everywhere it's
just going to be everywhere and and
you'll be surprised when something
doesn't look amazing
it'll like stand out and you'll say
you'll say to yourself why did
why did you put this advertisement in
this publication when all you had to do
is push two buttons and AI could have
fixed this for you and it was free like
like anything that is an excellent
will just look like a mistake so it'll
all be excellent yeah so I think all art
will actually go away
art will go away
because it can only exist as an
exception
does that make sense
once there's no such thing as oh this
one is special it's just everywhere
every advertisement is Art every
building will be art every design will
be art every TV show will be AI it'll be
pretty good it just nothing will seem
special or interesting
and I think there's probably a
biological reason why we're built this
way
I believe we are biologically designed
to identify a genetic advantage in
another human
that makes sense right we are
genetically evolved that we can see oh
that person can shoot a basketball
really well I want to mate with that
person that person is really smart I
want to mate with them that person can
create art
I want to meet with them
so it so we we can spot exceptionalism
anywhere and I often think that when
we're looking at art
we're actually thinking about the mating
potential of the creator
even though we're not directly thinking
of it that that's that's the thing
that's triggering us is the mating
potential of the creator that they
created something amazing now the art
itself can also be breathtaking
all right so let me not take away from
the art the art can be breathtaking
but the only reason we respond to it is
that we're seeing a genetic greatness
coming through the art
that's my hypothesis
I do think humor will be the last thing
that goes to AI but that when it does it
will be instant
humor will not go slowly
the the moment AI can do humor
it will do it like it will replace
people basically
um but we don't know when that will
happen could happen soon
all right here's uh
something uh I want to see if I can get
your agreement on it
you can't sell any idea to the public
until they get a little bit used to it
would you agree with that that you can't
introduce a brand new idea to the public
because we we uh reflexively
reject anything new
would you agree not every person not
every human not every situation but as
as a public we reject everything new the
first time you hear it but over time
would you agree that if you hear an idea
enough it starts to make sense
do you remember the first time you heard
about uh reparations for slavery
the first time
did you say well that's not going to
happen no but nobody's going to take
that seriously right but then you just
kept hearing it and hearing it and
hearing it and now there are committees
looking into a formula for it
like suddenly it went from a ridiculous
idea
to it just got socialized and became
part of the fabric and now it's normal
think back to when you first heard that
Trump had privately asked his defense
secretary I think about the option of uh
attacking the cartels directly
militarily do you remember what your
first reaction was
holy cow you can't do that that would be
an invasion of Mexico that's not going
to happen and and the News treated it
like Trump was basically a crazy person
right
well
I I brought up the idea a number of
times and when I brought it up initially
I got the same response
which is yeah no that you don't you
can't attack your neighboring country
you can't do that
how about now
how about today
today it's an option isn't it
it's an absolute option and politicians
are talking about it out loud
it's actually being discussed Out Loud
by traditional politicians
that's
um
that's where we need to get to get
anything done about the border and about
fentanyl you have to get to the point
where it feels normal
that our military would take out the
cartels
and it's getting there so I was asking
these uh provocative questions on
Twitter and let me let me start by
saying I do not recommend vigilanteism
or killing anybody
so I do not recommend violence I'm just
predicting
predicting the things get worse with
fentanyl
sooner or later a bunch of dads with ARs
are going to surround a fentanyl
dealer's house and Light It Up
it's going to happen
sooner or later
and it's going to feel like
there was a good reason for it
now when I asked when I was
provocatively saying can an American
citizen
kill a member of the cartel if they find
them on American soil
even if they're not in the act of
threatening anybody can you just kill
them for being the enemy Invader on your
land in in a hot War
and almost everybody said yes
think about that
I asked if Americans should be allowed
to kill
fentanyl dealers and let's say cartel
members on American soil if they're not
actively threatening somebody at that
moment and a lot of people said
absolutely yeah you could kill that
person that would be self-defense in
every in every definition
now in my in my opinion it should be
legal
so I don't recommend it because I don't
think it's legal
but in my opinion we should change the
law and make that legal because it's
going to happen anyway
you just have to make sure the dads get
pushed far enough
you know what I mean and by the way this
is a case where I'm not going to say
internet dads includes women and
everybody else
this does not include women
if if ever there's this situation and I
predict it will happen I don't recommend
it I don't promote it don't recommend it
but the government has checked out
the government is allowing The Invasion
to
to happen
it looks like they're promoting it
so I mean their actions would suggest
that they want it rather than they want
to stop it
so I think that the inevitable outcome
of that
will be there will be enough people who
have personally lost somebody to
Fentanyl that they're just going to
surround a deal or location and just
take them out
and they will bid at the beginning
now here's the other thing that's really
pissing me off
how many how many right-wing uh
militias are there
you can stop worrying about your
right-wing militias
like if you're on the left and you're
worried about right leg right wing
malicious
they're not doing anything about an
invasion
There's an actual invasion of the
country right now
and there isn't one freaking militia who
has organized to stop it
done
and you're worried about them
they could not be more toothless
clearly this is LARPing and you know
some kind of Lifestyle preference
clearly the militias are not here to
protect anything
if they were here to protect anything
they would be organizing against the
cartels they'd be doing what the
government is not doing for them which
is protecting the country
again I don't recommend militias I don't
recommend that they act in any way I'm
just saying
that the country is now ready for direct
violence
and I don't care if they're in the
country or not
I'm not recommending it I'm saying what
I care about
so to be perfectly clear I would love
every American citizen to say in public
that they would not vote to convict if
they were on a jury they were never
convict an American for killing a cartel
member in on uh in the United States or
even in Mexico
I I'd like to I'd like to see uh if we
have anybody in congress who isn't uh
useless I'd like to see one of them
propose a law a federal law
that says that if you kill a cartel
member on American soil it's legal
under any condition
not you don't have to be directly
threatened
now such a law could never be passed
would you agree
there's no way Congress would pass a law
like that because it would be violence
in the streets
but we should have the conversation
we should have the conversation about
killing cartel members on American soil
citizens doing it
because our government has abandoned us
the government has abandoned you they
are not working to protect you
and if we can't do that ourselves we
should at least ask why not
I I'd like to see somebody do a public
argument
telling us why we can't do that
now we can't do it because it's illegal
and I vigorously recommend you don't do
anything like that
but we should have a conversation about
making it legal
because if the government's abandoning
you you have the absolute right of
self-defense
there is no there's no wiggle room
and right now the government's laws are
denying you your natural right of
self-defense
you have a natural right to self-defense
that's the only natural right I think I
believe in
uh I'm not a big fan of a thing called
natural rights but the one that's
unambiguous
is self-defense
like you don't even have to call it a
right
to say that you agree with it it just is
like that's not something you debate
self-defense is not a debate
but I like to see the the people who are
against it try
I'd like to see what that looks like
all right so my main point on this is
that the American attitude is changing
and it's going to lead to something
and my prediction is
it's going to be violent
it has to be
all right
what else is happening I think that's
about it
probably the best live stream you'll
ever see in your life
now remember I told you and I'll tell
you again that AI
um is going to change everything
in a way we cannot predict cannot
predict
um
but this UFO thing is interesting in its
timing isn't it
if you were if you were another
civilization let's say an advanced
civilization and you had been watching
Earth for
hundreds of years or whatever
would you contact the citizens before
they had AI
or is the introduction of AI which let's
say let's speculate they know is
happening would that be the time you
made contact
because that's a weird coincidence isn't
it that our UFO Hysteria
is is at a Peak at exactly the same time
the AI is becoming conscious
I don't know that would be sort of a big
coincidence if those two things were
happening now I'm still going to go with
the UFOs are all fake
all right so in case
in case you want to know where I stand I
believe all of the UFOs are fake in
terms of aliens I don't believe aliens
are on Earth
but
if there are aliens
the the version I prefer
is that they've always been here
always meeting since the beginning of
people but they had to get here
somewhere yeah my my preference is that
they've always been here on Earth
and that they live underwater
that's all they just live underwater
and what and the reason we can't find
them is they live in deep water and you
know it's just deeper than we can detect
yeah now I don't I would not bet on that
yeah or maybe they're like uh Atlantis
or something like that now I wouldn't
bet on that I would I would put zero
dollars to bet that that's true
but if there are aliens it seems more
likely that their travel time
uh is limited
right it feels like to have a lot of
activity
would sort of indicate they're here if
we saw one thing once
that would suggest it was one chip from
a distant planet
but if there's you know stuff swirling
around and has been for years you know
just aliens all over the place well then
I'd suggest maybe they're already here
just because of the commute time
some are interdimensional
maybe so
maybe so
Maybe
they're just different game players
maybe this simulation exists but people
are playing different games on the same
field
because it's expensive you know
relatively to create an entire
environment
but once you've created it maybe the the
people who create it and said oh let's
introduce some aliens and we'll put some
animals and some people and you could
inhabit any of them
so as a game player you could you could
be a human character or an alien
character who is visiting
now how many of you think the alien
stuff is uh an intentional distraction
it's an obvious distraction but do you
think is a government intended
distraction
I don't see any evidence of that
what I see is a government that doesn't
know how to deal with whatever the hell
is happening
all I see is incompetence
and uncertainty
that's all I see
if you think that the collection of
uncertainty and stupidity indicates a
Ultra capable government that has
secrets
Maybe
[Laughter]
maybe they're Ultra capable and Ultra
capable of keeping secrets
Maybe
but what is more likely
is more likely that you're just seeing a
bunch of uncertainty and incompetence in
space garbage
it's probably just space garbage there's
probably just you know weather balloons
that are deactivated that just never
came down
don't you think plastic bags weather
balloons I think we're just going to
find out that there's some kind of
debris in space I know he says but
always always in modern times anyway
we were capable enough to blow up the
Nordstrom well I do believe that
Americans are capable of blowing up
yeah the if you gave us one task say all
right here are a hundred tasks
uh number one task I'd like you to work
out this reparations thing so all the
public is happy
probably probably not so good at that
number two we'd like you to change your
spending habits to bring down the
inflation and national debt
probably probably not so good at that
we'd like you to change the the racial
uh animosity in this country and bring
down the temperature
not so good
now let's say we give them the tenth
task which is
we'd like you to blow up some
do you want it to blow up in a certain
way
no no just just blow the out of it
do you think America can do that
yes we can yes we can we can blow up
something no matter where it is we can
find in space and blow it up we can
find things you didn't even know existed
and we'll blow that up too there isn't
anything we can't blow up you've got a
bridge we'll take it out you got a jet
we'll blow it up you got a building
we'll take it we'll take it we'll blow
it up yeah blowing stuff up is what we
can do
high altitude the Pentagon testing Mass
surveillance balloons across the U.S
so this is from 2019. the Pentagon was
testing Mass surveillance balloons
across the U.S
now this article was in the guardian so
who knows how reliable it is but uh
that that would fit my
hypothesis my hypothesis is that there's
just tons of floating around up
there
some of it is just garbage some of it we
know about
probably we have to shoot down our own
uh surveillance balloons just to show
that we're not weak
I I feel like Canada was like hey hey
can you shoot down one of our our
balloons
because we look we don't want to look
weak
we want to look feminine so we're going
to ask the big strong United States to
shoot it down for us
thanks guys
all right
um
careful Scott is an FBI informant you're
being warned in the comments
that's totally likely
all right
um
that might be totally what's happening
yeah I'm not joking when I say that we
may have intentionally shot down one of
our own assets to make it look like
Biden is decisive and are in our
military is capable that's a real thing
yeah I would say that's at least
40 likely
maybe not the most likely thing but it's
at least 40 percent likely we knew we
were shooting down in our own asset
just to look tough
if we're unmanned it would be a pretty
inexpensive way to you know boost your
military
preparedness illusion
all right
um
YouTube I think we're done here I'm
gonna go talk privately to the locals
subscribers
and uh but on YouTube you can do me a
favor and hit the Subscribe button
turns out that that's useful so hit that
subscribe button if if you like and
I'll see you tomorrow on YouTube and
we'll talk to the locals people for a
bit bye for now
