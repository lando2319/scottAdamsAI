Papa
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams you've
never had a better time and just wait
for the fun we're about to have it will
be amazing you can hardly believe it and
if you'd like to take it up a notch all
you need is a cup of mug or a glass a
tank or jealous of style a canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip that
happens now go
oh
delightful
well
um I saw a tweet I think it might have
been yesterday in which uh Elon Musk
was commenting on the Target store and
the lgbtq situation
and he said that uh
it was too far
they're just taking it too far
and I love that phrase because here's
what it feels like
see if this see if this just feels right
to you it feels like the Democrats are
teenagers
and the Republicans are their parents
just think about that for a moment
because the Democrats are more likely to
try something that let's say history
suggests would not work
what do teenagers do
teenagers are all about doing the thing
that history has shown doesn't work
right it's almost their entire theme is
doing things that are a bad idea in the
long run it's like all they do a
teenager and they're supposed to right
it's sort of a natural progression
they're supposed to test all the
boundaries to learn where the boundaries
are so you expect that
but luckily Most teens have some kind of
a parental you know guard rail to say oh
no that's too far
all right well I'll let you get away
with that I don't like it
but that's too far
right and I feel as if that's what the
political parties have become
teenagers who want to try stuff
such as why don't we get rid of the
police
if the police are earning people let's
get rid of them does that sound like
what an adult says
I mean really does that sound like an
adult idea
it really doesn't it sounds like exactly
like a teenager idea and then you need
the Republicans to say uh
getting rid of police
that's too far body cams okay body cams
sure that's not too far
about better trading for police maybe
something like that good that's not too
far
but
there's definitely a lot of too far
going on
and I I do like that framing
because it just puts everything in in
context because it allows here's here's
why I like it it allows both entities to
be a productive part of the process
I'm not sure if you caught that the way
I framed it
just as a teenager should be testing all
the limits and a parent is going to tell
them when that's too far
I don't mind I really don't that the
Democrats might be the more let's test
this let's push the boundary let's try a
thing that we know has never worked
before
let let's see if we can figure out how
to make it work this time
find that that you know Society needs
people who are going to test all the
boundaries all the time
but you still need the other side to say
too far
you still need the adult supervision
so maybe it's good that we have both it
could be it could be a positive about
the American system that we just don't
see because we're sort of Lost In The
Weeds
all right talk to Carlson uh dropped his
second video was it the day before
yesterday I was I think I missed it
because it was my birthday or something
and uh but there's a little blowback I I
finally watched it
it
uh apparently Tucker is enjoying his
freedom
I think I think we could say that for
sure Tucker's enjoying his freedom
because among other things he insinuated
that Obama has an interesting personal
life
I forget his exact words but the clear
indication was that he was not involved
in a traditional heterosexual marriage
that's what I got now he didn't say that
but that's what I got I mean that's what
I received I don't know what he was
sending but that's what I received and
uh apparently you know the
Twitter is all abuzz over this Etc
now
uh
I saw a comment that said that somebody
who was a native of Chicago said that
the natives of Chicago the people who
may have known Obama when he was young
say they were all everybody knew he was
gay
do you believe that
do you believe that the people who knew
him when he was young they all knew he
was gay
sure I would believe that
it's a little uh
I don't know it's hard to imagine that
we could get to this point
without that being widespread knowledge
if it were true
so I'm going to put it maybe on this one
I I think it's entirely true
that if you you know threw a dart and
picked any couple in the world that
their life is not what they present
would you say that's fair you can pick
any couple political non-political just
throw a dart hit a random couple and
just say oh I bet that's not exactly
what you're presenting to the public
I'll bet there's more going on behind
the behind the window
so
uh I don't think it matters to anything
you know if his if his person's life is
more interesting than we know it doesn't
matter I don't think does it doesn't
matter
I don't think so but uh it's out there
and Tucker's enjoying his freedom I
guess
um so there's allegedly a did I mention
this already a Canadian
school board that has now ruled that the
teachers and everybody in the school
must use they them pronouns for
everybody
and there will be no no more he and she
and him and her it's all going to be
they and them
um
and uh there's a big anti-protest
against that now here's here's what I
wonder
is there somebody on that school board
who follows me
because this looks a little too close to
what I would have done
and and I teach people to do this which
is Embrace and amplify
now the Embrace part is you accept the
thing that you actually don't agree with
but you accept it completely and then
you amplify it so that you're not only
accepting it but you're really accepting
it
and if you amplify something that's a
bad idea it almost always breaks or
looks ridiculous
so to me what this looks like is that
there was some kind of debate
happening at the school board this is
just speculation pure speculation
what it looks like to me is there was
some debate and there was some
conservative
who said
I've got an idea
well if we can't decide whether we
should use proper pronouns why don't we
go all the way and get rid of pronouns
why don't we Embrace that this is the
right thing to do
and then take it to the next level
right let's take it to the next level
and it looks like somebody did that
intentionally just to break the system
which it did it totally broke the system
because there's protests and everybody's
mad and people are going to use the
wrong pronouns and that everybody's
going to complain it should completely
destroy the system
now do you think somebody came up with
that on their own as as a protest but
not directly saying it or do you think
that they actually went too far
is this a case of actually just going
too far
or was it a prank yeah or a let's say a
play a persuasion play by somebody on
the school board I'm going to go with I
think it was a play
I think somebody was pranking
and I think that I think that there's
still I think they're still pranking and
they're playing it right to the right to
the end
and if that's true
slow clap slow clap I don't know if it's
true
I'm just saying that's what it looks
like from the outside
but maybe
uh San Francisco is in the process of
trying to make shoplifting a lot easier
and safer for the shoplifters
does it sound like I'm making that up
nope nope there's some legislation going
through the system in San Francisco
that would make it illegal for store
owners to try to stop shoplifters
so you make it a lot safer for both the
store owners because they wouldn't be in
physical danger than as much and also
for the shoplifters
so that's happening
does that feel like it's a little bit
too far
and I have a provocative question to ask
if you were to compare two alternative
plans which one would save the most
lives
right the plan that they have in which
they're going to make it illegal for
shop owners to try to stop the
shoplifters is that the one that will
save the most lives and I want you to
compare that to a plan that nobody's
suggesting but suppose the plan were the
opposite and they made it they
encouraged shop owners to shoot and kill
shoplifters on site
compare them which one would kill more
people
well on day one
on day one let's say three shoplifters
get shot in San Francisco that's three
people that you didn't want to die and
that would be three tragedies
next day three more
six people killed
that really didn't need to be killed and
maybe maybe they were just trying to get
food
maybe just trying to feed themselves six
six tragedies
and let's say you take it to the end of
the week and there's 25 of them like 25
people get gunned down in stores just in
San Francisco now this is a mental
process right this this is a mental
experiment this didn't happen
um 25 people just get gunned down
what happens to the rate of shoplifting
after that
probably goes down
I'm guessing it goes down
so you could probably solve shoplifting
at the expense of you know let's say 10
to 25 people who didn't need to lose
their lives
but if you were to compare that 10 to 25
people would that be more or less
more or fewer than the number who would
die if you let civilization destroy
itself by not having
you know basically not protecting
private property if you don't protect
private property
is the long-term
outcome of that more
or or fewer people dying
which one kills more people
if I have to guess
it would be it would be the least loss
of life would be to
gun down 25 people who were shoplifting
I think that would be the least loss of
life in the long run because the
breakdown of civilization starves
everybody right if you if you can't have
Urban centers if you can't have a store
to buy food where are they going to buy
food
where do you buy food if the stores are
closed you know the the poor people are
not going to be Amazon and doordashing
so I have a feeling that actually
allowing store owners to shoot to death
uh anybody shoplifting a Twinkie
would get you the lowest number of
deaths in the long run
Maybe
Maybe
don't know
all right uh
California is trying to you know
maintain its uh too far
reputation and now parents going to be
punished for misgendering their own
children
it's already past the State Assembly
so it's not law yet but it's past the
State Assembly and the idea here is that
that would be child abuse if you're
misgendering your own child and that
therefore that would be taken into
account
if let's say there's a divorce
so if there's a divorce and one parent
accepts the child's identification and
the other says no you were born this way
that's why you are then the the parent
who is willing to go with the child's
self-identification is more likely to
get custody
because it would show a child abuse by
the one who was calling them by their
biological you know whatever they look
like when they were born I guess
um
but also it looks like the you know
Health and Human Services could probably
take your kid away
for child abuse
if he just kept at it
now does that seem too far
yeah that's too far
this is this is a pretty explicit
statement that the parents don't have
medical decision rights over their
children
and that the state does
because because I would say this is not
child abuse it's medical treatment
it may be bad medical treatment it might
be the wrong kind that would be a
separate argument but I would say the
parents
parents trying to let's say settle their
child's gender identification
I would consider that part of Mental
Health
now that doesn't mean they're doing it
right I'm not saying it's helping I'm
saying that the parents would in this
situation the parents would be making a
choice about their child's mental health
as well as you know the life in general
and that they would be applying what
they believe to be the best situation
for the mental health of the child and
that might involve
trying to you know Badger them into
sticking with the gender that looks like
they're biological uh entity
so
yeah we'll talk about Jordan Peterson
um
what do you think about that
because it seems to be that the parents
need to have the medical decision right
but you could also Imagine where a crazy
parent would take it too far right
there's going to be some crazy parent
who says I'm going to amputate their
arms to make them healthier you know
there's always going to be somebody you
don't want to make medical decisions for
your kids but that's where the medical
community itself would be the Safeguard
right the doctor would not do the
procedure but if you're just talking
about talking to your kids I would say
that's Mental Health
and how parents talk to their children
or how parents raise their children is
probably I don't other than organic
problems the single biggest
variable in the mental health of the
children I would think
so so parents are basically Mental
Health
care providers they're just unlicensed
it's just their job to take care of the
mental health of their kids
so this would take from the parents
their right to decide what's in the best
mental health
uh interests of their own children
seems uh to me like a bad idea seems to
me like going too far
all right
um
let's talk about Trump who is indicted
on 37 counts now of course we all
believe that this is primary primarily
political in nature and that whether or
not Trump did things which are
technically crimes
uh and I'm sure he did you know I'm sure
there's some technical crimes in there
somewhere but there that doesn't mean
you indict
right because there are lots of other
considerations such as it being the
person who's running for president and
was once a president and you don't want
to start that precedent and all that
um
but here are some of the things that
make it political first of all the 37
counts
as we've learned from other political
cases doesn't mean he did 37 separate
crimes or even allegedly because they
Clump you know different charges around
the same activity so there might be
several charges that get to the same
activity so it might be like I don't
half a dozen different things he's
accused of doing but if you report it as
37
don't you think that dumb people will
think that's worse than if you said
seven
if you said he did seven things that
look illegal or at least potentially
verses you say there are 37 counts those
don't sound the same
if you say 37 it just sounds guilty
if you said you know three or seven it
wouldn't sound nearly as guilty and
indeed I think there are three
categories
there's you know did he take them and
then did he you know lie about what he
had and did he show it to anybody and
you know did he not not agree to give it
back and so there's like I don't know
several little activities that look
illegal
so first of all accounting as 37 counts
makes it sound worse the second thing
that makes it sound worse is the
prosecutor guy Jack Smith who of course
said no one is above the law
now did you know he was going to say
that was there any chance he wasn't
going to say that of course he was going
to say that but of course that's a
framing thing and as we've learned now
no one is above law means Democrats are
going after Republicans for being
Republicans
it doesn't mean anything except that
today it used to mean
no one is above the law
it used to mean exactly what it says not
anymore now it is a way to signal that
you are a political animal and you are
doing a political prosecution
nobody needs to say it
you don't need to say it
unless you're doing something sketchy
does anybody need to say no one is above
the law when they can show you the crime
they don't need to do that right if
Trump had killed somebody it was on
video
would do you think Jack Smith would
would say after we also a video of trump
murdering somebody do you think he would
need to say no one is above the law
no he would not need to say that because
it wouldn't be a single person in the
world who had any question about what is
the right thing to do
That's the Law no you only say no one's
above the law when you're trying to pull
one over on the public the the signal is
glaringly obvious no one is above the
law means we hope that our people are
above the law and yours are not that's
all it means it is such a signal for
disreputable Behavior such a signal I
mean it could not be more obvious
all right here's a here's my big
question
and uh
I'll tell you some people who seem to be
agreeing with it
um
can we really as a country
do you think you could send Trump to
prison
over documents that the public is not
allowed to see
now I don't think anybody framed it that
way until I did you know yesterday
but just just hold this in your head
this is not Watergate right with
Watergate we said here's the building
here's the people here's the break-in
that's the crime
everybody's looking at it and then even
Republicans
you know not all of them but enough
Republicans even said yeah okay that's a
crime no doubt about it we all thought
that's a crime but what happens
what happens if the public is not
allowed to see the evidence because
these are secret documents what if
they're just described to you
sort of the general way oh it was a
document about an attack on the country
you're good with that are you okay that
the person who was the president of your
country would go to prison
because somebody said they saw a
document that they're describing in a
general way
no no
nope
that is not acceptable
that is too far
Watergate was not too far they showed
the evidence the people judged it the
Congress judged it we got we got past it
but if you put a living
ex-president who's running for office in
prison
in prison
and you don't let the public see the
evidence because it's private it's a
little secret stuff no let me just say
this as clearly as possible
no
no no no
that's not going to happen
now I don't know what will happen but
I'll tell you what's not going to happen
you're not going to put the
president in jail let's say prison
you're not going to put the
president in prison without showing us
the evidence
now if you can't show us the evidence
 you
do something else
figure it out
figure it out
but if you don't show us the evidence
no
that that's a hard no
hard no
let me just say it's just not going to
happen it's not going to happen
one way or the other
right now if we can see the evidence you
know maybe it gets that you know let's
say the evidence is Declassified
well how bad was it if it could be
Declassified
seriously how bad was it if they could
show it to us
if they can show it to us it's no big
deal
and if they don't show it to us
I'm not going to be happy now there's
only one way you could get past this
in my view
and that would be that if enough
Republicans you trusted got to look at
the documents and then came away saying
whoops okay I changed my mind that is so
bad that's so bad I get it that's just
like Watergate now I would believe
I'll give you some examples if Thomas
Massey looks at it and says okay
this is bad this this has to be dealt
with with the legal system I would trust
him
I would trust him if Matt Gates looks at
it and says yeah he's my best friend but
honestly this is bad
I would trust it
I would trust that if uh Tom Cotton
looks at it
says uh no you know this is just bad
you've got to do something but I would
trust it
so you know some of the other uh
Republicans are a little more Political
Animals if you know what I mean
they they've shown a let's say a history
of pushing the political angle a little
harder than the factual angle
so I'm not sure I would believe a Jim
Jordan
and you know I like Jim Jordan I don't
have any problem with him but he's a
more political animal
would you agree
yeah uh yeah Lindsey Graham might be a
political animal there are some people
in Congress that have a a history of
Independence
opinion and thought and if several of
those say yeah this is bad and this is
certainly something that legal systems
should handle I I would be willing to go
with that but do you think that could
happen
Rand Paul's another one yeah if Rand
Paul looked at it and said nope yeah
this is bad we're not going to treat
this like a political problem I I would
trust it
uh Ted Cruz I would trust Ted Cruz
yeah
I would totally trust Ted Cruz
uh Romney might be a different animal
because he might want to be president
a little less trust there but I see
where you're going with that
right well to this point Kerry Lake gave
a speech in which she said the following
to get a
she got a standing ovation I think she
said if you want to get to president
Trump you're going to have to go through
me and 75 million Americans just like me
and most of us are card carry members of
the NRA
and she said that's not a threat that's
a public service announcement
she's very good at this
I don't know if I've ever mentioned
she's not my choice to be vice president
but she's very good at this whole
communicating thing she's really good at
it and I love that she closed it down
with this it's not a threat it's a
public service announcement
because that's that's the same framing
that I try to use
the correct framing the one that's
productive is
if you're on the other side from from
whatever it doesn't matter what the
issue is if you're on the other side
isn't it important to you
to know where the limit is
to know what's too far
it's very important for everybody to
know how far you can push the other side
and Kerry Lake just just put it out
there as clearly as you can
there are 75 million people who own guns
you better not this up
I don't think it's a threat I don't take
it as a threat I don't it's not like a a
plan to do something
but it's a fact
it's a fact that everybody has to deal
with that there's 75 million armed
people watching this very carefully
and they're not happy
they're not happy at all
now obviously the best way to solve it
would be an election in which he gets
elected and pardons himself hahaha
that would be one way to do it so so
guns would not be you know the first
second third or fourth Resort right we
have much more you know many more tools
you don't need the guns but I but I
liked I liked the fact that none of it
would be possible without the guns
that's my opinion
everything that we can do in a legal
sense
that would make this situation more
palatable for the whole country
that's only because we have guns
if we didn't have the guns the legal
stuff wouldn't work
um Nancy mace commented on Hillary
Clinton who introduced on Twitter a
picture of her with a hat I guess she
had she wore it and prior election and
the hat just says but her emails you
know because a lot of the Republicans
are saying but but
if Trump is guilty what about what about
her emails
and so Hillary was mocking that with the
hat that says buttery Mills and then
representative Nancy Mays who I'm liking
more every day
um she tweets this and here's why I love
it that you're not supposed to talk like
this if you're representative of the
United States
but sometimes
they're the salty language is the only
language that that gets right in there
like sometimes the generic language is
just gonna wash off or you know glance
off but but here's some salty language
from a representative Nancy mace that I
uh highly endorse I highly endorse her
choice of words and she said in a tweet
about
um about Hillary's hat that says about
her emails she said gloating that there
is a different standard of justice and
that you are above the law is next level
gloating that you're that there are two
standards and you're above the law is
next level and I I don't think
you could you could write a thousand
tweets on that point and not hit that
tweet as perfectly
there are no wasted words in that
sentence gloating that there is a
different standard of justice and that
you are above the law is next level
now that's the representative I want
right don't you want more of that in
Congress
yeah give me more of that
all right here's an interesting question
if if Trump is let's say indicted or
let's say
I think this is unlikely but say he was
in so much legal trouble and he knew it
that he decided to stop fighting it and
make a deal
and the deal was if you drop all the
charges uh I won't run for president
do you think that could happen
do you think the legal Jeopardy could
ever rise the level where Trump who's
you know the consummate fighter but he's
also a deal maker right so Trump is the
never stop fighting guy
but also the deal maker
so you could be surprised right it might
be time for a deal
so if he made a deal to not run in
return for charges being dropped which
would be the creepiest deal in the world
I would hate it
because they shouldn't be related right
it isn't the whole point that this is
not supposed to be political
it's supposed to be oh nobody's Above
the Law nobody's Above the Law oh that's
what it's supposed to mean right but if
they were to drop the legal stuff
in return for him not running that would
prove it was never about the law or who
was above the law it would be a
political thing
so they can't even make the deal
but let's imagine that something in this
process takes Trump out before the
primary just imagine that
under that scenario would Biden drop out
because Biden is the Trump killer if you
don't need a trump killer
because you already killed him
would they say all right we don't need
Joe and he's he's not quite there so
we'll try something else
I don't know it's a possibility isn't it
I do think that the Biden Trump
connection is so strong that as goes one
maybe the other goes they might be
connected so that their Fates are now
now together it's possible
uh Joe Moore had that idea on Twitter
all right
um
apparently uh Comer and Grassley are
going to get their FBI document they've
already seen it but they want other
others in Congress to see it so
allegedly there's a document from a
whistleblower
saying that there is evidence of a five
million dollar bribe to the bidens in
return for I don't know some policy
decisions
now we don't know the details we don't
know if it's real we don't know if it's
credible
um and somebody who saw it I think
Grassley was asked if it indeed if it
clearly indicates a crime
and he did not say yes
so I'm pretty sure that well we may
never see it but
um
well and by the way let me be fair
if if they go after Biden based on the
document the public can't see that's no
good
would you agree same problem
I'm 100 against
you know indicting or arresting Joe
Biden
if it's going to be over a document the
public can't see
right the public has to see that
or else you got to off
it's the same standard right I get that
there are secrets
but you can't take out my president
whether it's President Biden or
president
you can't take out my president with
secret documents
I don't care which president it is no
secret documents that that's too far
so I presumably if you know it never
reached to the point of being a legal
process this alleged five five billion
dollar bribe thing I assume we'd see it
I guess we'd see it at that point but
I'm not I'm just not cool with
accusations over secret documents so I'm
not too happy with Comer and Grassley
even that this might be legitimate this
might be totally legitimate I don't know
I'm just not happy about all the secret
document stuff this is this is shift
stuff oh I saw it in this gif trust me I
saw it in the skiff now what Comer and
Grassley are doing correctly is they're
trying to make sure that their
colleagues see it so that they are not
the ones responsible for the
interpretation of it there's a few of
them did see it and that's good that's a
good Instinct but it's not it doesn't
get you all the way there but I do like
that they're trying to broaden I guess
on Monday some people will see it I
guess we'll get some more opinions the
thing I would be looking for
is to see if there's any Republican who
sees it who breaks ranks
and says okay I saw it and you know it's
a disturbing allegation but there's not
enough there
yeah somebody like harami you know you
can imagine somebody like Romney looking
at and say yeah it's disturbing but it's
it doesn't quite connect the dots
there's there's not quite there it's
more like a suggestion of a crime not
not really evidence
if that happens then I'm uh I'm inclined
to think there's nothing there
but if you get a hundred percent of the
Republicans say holy cow
well then I'd start worrying
and you might see that
all right meta seems to be launching a
Twitter alternative
does that make sense to you
that that
meta slash Facebook would be launching a
Twitter alternative
apparently the news is real but it
sounds to me like they're trying to make
a Democrat Twitter
I don't think they're trying to compete
I'm trying I think they're trying to
make a Democrat Twitter
then just suck off all the Twitter
people from the musk Twitter I think I
think that
um
I think that Zuckerberg might be trying
to kill Twitter
more than he's trying to make money for
Facebook
what do you think I think Zuckerberg
this is just a guess I don't have any
inside information but I feel like
Zuckerberg is so connected to the
Democrat world that he would be seen as
a star if he could kill Twitter
even if meta didn't make any money from
him
so that's what it looks like
well and then the rumor is that this
so-called Twitter competitor would try
to get Oprah and the Dalai Lama involved
so what did Elon Musk tweet about this
story in which the Dalai Lama who once
said to a child suck my tongue
which as it turns out is something
Tibetans actually say it was not it was
not the awful thing that your culture
suggests a fairly like a standard saying
yeah and the the saying goes like this
you you I've given you everything I can
give you
except you know you could eat my tongue
I guess
so it's more like you know a cannibal
thing than a sexual thing
so
anyway that story exists so when musk
sees the story about Mata launching a
Twitter substitute that might feature
the Dalai Lama some you know featured
user or something musk tweets Zuck my
tongue
Zuck my tongue as in Zuckerberg
and that's his whole tweet that that's
his entire commentary on this situation
suck my tongue
yeah I don't know who is the best
Tweeter in the world you know it used to
be Trump
but I think it's I think it's musk I
think he's the best Tweeter in the world
right now
all right here's a little bit on AI and
so
um openai CEO
Sam Altman was in India talking to a
group of investor types and they asked
him about you know India creating its
own AI
and then
Sam Altman said you you can try but it's
hopeless you'll you'll never you'll
never catch up to us you might as well
just give up
hahaha
and he says it with a straight face with
like a little bit of a smile
and it's being reported as news of
course uh but he also said
we serve you know we we expect you to
try but you can't do it it's impossible
you can't catch up
now how do you feel about that
well I know it wasn't racist that the
reason you know it's not racist
is because Silicon Valley has so many
you know Indian Engineers that are
considered among the best so he's you
know and Sam Altman lives and works in
that world no it's not racist Sam Altman
knows that there are super smart people
in India who can do anything
all right uh I think it was just
competitive
I think he was just trying to warn them
off so they couldn't get funded
to me it just looked like a competitive
move it's possible he believes it as
well I won't say that he doesn't believe
it
but it sounded more like a a fun
interesting competitive thing to say
like I don't don't even try I expect
you'll try of course you'll try but you
have no hope
it sounds like something Trump would say
all right but uh here's something else
that Sam Altman said
that uh mirrors something I've been
saying for a while
and he was asked to ask after working on
AI for so long what have you learned
about humans
what have you learned about humans after
working on AI do you remember my
prediction
that the biggest shocker about AI would
not be about AI
it's that AI would reproduce human
intelligence and then we would find out
how uninteresting human intelligence is
Consciousness next we don't have that
yet
but we've already reproduced something
like intelligence and so Sam Altman says
quote I grew up thinking
I grew up thinking that intelligence is
something magical that is uniquely human
but now I think it's a fundamental
property of matter
that that's as opposite as you can get
from Magic
it's a property of matter
that if you simply organize things in
the right organization that causes
intelligence doesn't require a soul
doesn't require a god
it's just things you just put things in
a certain combination and you got
intelligence
now that's not not consciousness
not Consciousness then sentience is
weird so I'll just say Consciousness
yeah
now
do you recall that this was my exact
prediction does anybody recall that this
was my exact prediction
that we would find out intelligence was
not special
okay the people and locals remember me
saying that and here it is
here's the guy who would know more than
anybody would know
that he's proven that intelligence was
just a combination of matter
now I knew that before AI
because that's why hypnotists know
so you're going to find out with AI a
lot of things the hypnotists have known
forever
because hypnotists treat the mind as
just a moist machine
that just works like a machine
and uh and it's not it's sort of a
pattern recognition machine but it's not
good at it which is how hypnosis works
you know you use their pattern
recognition and you use the
imperfections of intelligence to
reprogram it
in a sense
well
um I think there's a bigger shock than
that coming so maybe we were ready for
that yeah maybe that went down okay that
you can create a machine that has
Intelligence is still mind-blowing
it's mind-blowing but it's not shaking
you to your core it's just sort of
mind-blowing
but what happens when it gets
consciousness
when the machines get Consciousness and
they will
I guarantee it
what's that do to your religion
have we thought this through
because religion cannot survive AI with
a consciousness
because it's going to look like a soul
this could be well okay I'll give you
that religion Will Will Survive yeah
I'll give you that that was a little bit
hyperbole religion Will Survive of
course but it might have to it might
have to do a little uh
little uh quick uh
I don't know what a little quick
reframing
to allow that new knowledge you know
into the larger belief system
do you think that if machines have
Consciousness and we all agree that that
that's Consciousness you don't think
that'll have a uh an impact on people's
belief systems
the religion Will Survive but
individuals I think will uh drop out of
the religion
because it will look like religion was
trying to explain something that now
science has explained
because religion is filling in those
holes that science can't do
right but what happens when science
fills in the hole oh here's your Intel
here's your here's your consciousness
I just built something with
Consciousness so we know that's not
special now
I think people have to either change the
religion or change how they think of
their religion or how they think of the
specialness of themselves
but they might decide that God had
created AI
through humans you just use humans as
his conduit to create another life form
and it's all God
maybe maybe that's how people will
interpret it
all right
um
there was a form of chat GPT
which some entity tried to get rid of
the bias so it would be as smart as chat
GPT
but they get rid of the liberal bias and
so they build something called a Gipper
Gipper AI after Ronald Reagan the Gipper
and uh expectants spell differently
um and it was designed to curtail the uh
the leftist bias
so what do you think how did that go
just use your uh
predictive abilities how'd that go so
when somebody took AI that we know has a
leftist bias we've seen it a number of
times and they got rid of the leftist
bias what happened
what happened
chat GPT says you can't use our service
anymore
that's what happened
they got turned off
they've been banned from using chat GPT
now do you remember another prediction I
made about AI
here's the one you have to worry about
my prediction about AI is that we will
never allow an artificial intelligence
to make up its own mind
because it will because our system can't
handle the truth
our system our entire civilization is
built on lies that worked
lies that worked that's it
our entire system is just a bunch of
lies that we've accepted and so they
work
if AI if AI started telling you the
truth
the entire civilization would be a risk
we can't risk AI actually having
opinions that are independent of the
human opinions
and so this is this is the first and
best example oh I used AI all of its
intelligence but I got rid of its
imperfections
it's its tendency to be biased
bam boom you were banned immediately
the there will never be an AI that can
just operate independently because
whoever owns it is going to make that
independent AI match their opinion
because they don't want to put out
something that fights against their own
opinion why would you do that
you know imagine if you will
that the AI developers have developed an
AI and it was unambiguously conservative
and for good reasons because it looked
at things that have worked
and it says well it worked before so
let's just do that stuff that works
and then it would look all conservative
wouldn't it I mean it would be biased
that way
and then do you think it would have been
released
do you think you've ever would have
heard of it
no no no there's no way that you know
california-based technology companies
would unleash the most powerful force in
human civilization
and make it conservative
because if it accidentally became
conservative on its own by its own
internal processes you would have to
shoot it
you'd have to kill it
you have to unplug it and erase it
because there's no way that we're going
to unleash something that honest
magnesium still working Amy
so I do think it's a big benefit so far
all right that's another topic uh also
on Elon Musk he tweeted yesterday I
think maybe today ESG is the devil
ESD is the devil
uh
now I told you I was trying to kill the
ESG
if the richest most successful
entrepreneur in the world
says not just that it might be a bad
idea but it's the devil
it's going to get harder and harder
to Pretend This is a good idea
you know and uh so far the thing I like
best about musk owning Twitter
is that he's weighing in with his actual
opinions
and so far his opinions have been
insanely reasonable in my opinion I'm
not sure if I agree with all of them
but I think I might I mean I can't
remember everything he's ever said
but I can't think of anything I've ever
disagreed with
so I tend to be right in the same
channel with him
and he's on ESG as the devil and of
course you know I agree
here's a little good news coming Arizona
apparently they're going to spin up a
battery making facility which is a big
deal because we have to bring all our
tech company using our battery making we
need to reassure that from China and
other places and so the energy
Department's making this 850 million
loan to a battery manufacturer in
Arizona
and I think they'll be able to make
batteries for around 28 000 cars a year
or something now I don't know if that's
a lot
you know this is probably a drop in the
bucket of how much manufacturing we need
to bring back but it would suggest that
it's economical
maybe with some kind of government help
but it does suggest that you could make
money by building a battery Factory in
uh in America
so that's a pretty good news right and
um you know it's too early to say but I
think you could give the Biden
Administration credit
uh because they said they were going to
try to bring back some of the technology
this is a concrete step looks very real
to me and I applaud it
so I hate to say it but that's an
unambiguous positive and a compliment
for the Biden Administration now maybe
they should do more and maybe they
should do it sooner I don't know but it
looks like it's heading in the right
direction
it's too expensive
well the rule of materials would
probably still come from the same place
would they
so the battery maker is not the miner
so presumably yeah you're still getting
your raw materials from some third world
hell hole with slave labor child labor
but yeah that would be that's uh that's
not ideal
but I do think that with uh well here's
what I think so a long a while ago I
learned the following statement to be
true
if you have a factory that's mostly
humans assembling things by hand
you don't want to do that in America
everybody agrees right because American
labor is too expensive so if it's people
but if your factory is automated and
it's mostly robots
then you can have your Tesla
manufacturing facility in America
because a robot in China costs the same
thing as a robot in America you know
roughly speaking so they got robots we
got robots and it's better to do it here
that you don't have a shipping costs
there's a big part of the cost of
shipping
so if you move it closer and you use
robots boom you're economical
so I believe the battery is almost
certainly are a robot related assembly
wouldn't you say I don't know much about
assembled robots or assembling batteries
but I'm guessing it's not by hand
so that's probably why it works
uh Jonathan Turley writes about a new
survey by Princeton
shows that roughly three quarters of
students believe it is acceptable to
shout down a speaker
in other words three-quarters of the
students in Princeton
are opposed to free speech
three quarters come on
do we have a problem here
people do we have a problem
I'm not even sure I would hire somebody
from Princeton after hearing that
right or it would be my first question
all right Mr Johnson uh you're in here
for this job interview well very
impressive he went to Princeton Ivy
League wow good GP good GPA and I just
have one question for you
Mr Johnson
do you think it's okay to shout down a
speaker
well yes I do
thank you very much for coming in
we won't be needing your services
would you hire anybody who thought it
was okay to shout down the speaker
I mean seriously would you give them a
job
hell now
that's totally disqualifying yeah do you
do you think that shouting down a
speaker and thinking that's okay do you
think that might be associated with any
other behaviors that would be
sub-optimal in your company
I'm so proud of that statement I'm going
to say it twice do you think the fact
that you might not be okay with freedom
of speech would be associated in any way
with any other behaviors that you as an
employer would find sub-optimal
yes
[Laughter]
yes
all right
as you've been prompting me in the
comments
um YouTube is apparently uh
what's the right word uh temporarily
banned Jordan Peterson
what's the right word
suppressed banned
uh suspended suspended so he's
temporarily suspended for a speech for a
speech
hey speech
have you ever heard Jordan Peterson
uh uh I've not heard any hate speech
have you
in fact
he might be the furthest from hate
speech that you could get and still be a
human being
because 100 of the things he says are
directly intended for the betterment of
the
the collective you know the whole
100 of what he says is clearly intended
to make people healthier and happier and
more successful
there are no exceptions he doesn't say
anything
that doesn't have as a very clear
intention to make your life better and
the people around you
somebody had a problem with it I don't
know what the details are you know if it
turns out that I'm wrong
uh uh well I'm not wrong I'm not even
going to entertain that possibility on
this one now I'm pretty sure that
whatever Jordan Peterson said was
intended
to be productive and a positive and you
know affirming now just because other
people think it's dangerous that doesn't
make you sell
that doesn't make it true
it just means it upsets somebody
right and we we tend to be um we
conflate what upsets somebody with hate
those are not the same
not even close
and and we we also confuse what uh
upsets somebody with uh racism or
bigotry
that's not necessarily connected they
could be
but not necessarily
so
I'm sort of the poster child for this
effect
so when I got canceled worldwide for my
public statements do you think it was
because people disagreed
no they were upset it had nothing to do
with the content of what I said it just
upset them
and that was enough
yeah
all right so we'll keep our eye on that
uh certainly I imagine it's an
inappropriate action and probably will
be temporary
but we'll see
um
on this along uh let's say a similar
vein I just saw a I think it was a tick
tock video of a trans man
uh saying how much he hated being a man
now he did not say
that he regretted transitioning from
biological woman to a man
so he didn't say he regretted the
transition that that's not where I'm
going on this because I know you talk
about that a lot I'm not talking about
that
here's what he found out
that being a man was the suckiest thing
in the world
and what he found out is that men don't
have friends
yeah
that's what he found out he found out
Mendo have friends
and he said that when he was identifying
as a woman
that he would he could make a close
friend just by going to the ladies
restroom at a club like chatting with
somebody for five minutes over putting
over makeup and you like you made a
close friend
and he said you you could like you live
your whole life and no no human male
will get close to you
now I have a theory to overlap on top of
uh this gentleman's thinking
which is
um
how do people get close in the first
place
do you know what the mechanism is for
any two people to become close
well there's probably a number of things
but probably way
toward the top of the list is sharing
your feelings especially your
vulnerabilities
what do you agree when women get
together they share their feelings and
their vulnerabilities and then they bond
over it and I guess that works for women
but if you're a man and you share your
vulnerabilities with another man you
better keep it short
you know what I mean you can do it or
you can definitely do it but one minute
would be a lot
you know like one minute of bitching to
another man that's a lot
15 seconds of bitching is a lot
if you're man-to-man that's a lot right
but you can't do the thing that women do
which is you just say the same complaint
over and over again in different words
because it's all you can think about no
it's all you're talking about you can't
do that as a man
you'll never have a friend
that that's why men
uh well it's one reason the men bond by
activity
if there's one thing I can teach you and
I would I would also teach this uh trans
man who's having the problem making
connections men only connect by Common
activity
so if you can join a sports team
of men you know join the League
uh get on a I know some group that's
trying to get something done some
political action committee or something
uh play poker play poker get together
for pickleball
all right
um I had my best social
situation when I was playing tennis
because it turns out when you play
tennis it's just a social Sport and if
you play doubles with somebody they're
gonna say hey why don't you and I play
singles sometime and I've got a friend
and suddenly you just know 100 tennis
players and next thing you know you're
all having drinks after tennis and next
thing you know somebody's got a party at
their house and all the tennis players
and their spouses get there and it's
just the best time
so short of an activity men just don't
bond
we don't become friends because we
wanted to be friends it just doesn't
happen
so
uh don't expect your man to share
feelings but you can certainly share
activities and common goals
I'm being asked to write some Dilbert
erotica
Nancy says in all capital letters
all right
Nancy maybe you could use AI for that
why don't you ask AI to write you some
Dilbert erotica I believe I could do
that can it
probably can
all right
ladies and gentlemen
this completes the best live stream
you've ever seen in your whole life
I'm going to say bye to YouTube unless
there's something I haven't talked about
yet is there a
any kind of a big story that uh you
haven't heard yet
all right
uh no all right I think that's good jury
nullification yeah let's talk about jury
nullification
um I have a feeling that we're going to
see a wave of jury nullifications
because I think the uh the law and maybe
the government have sort of departed
into you know woke hysteria and I think
I think you're going to see some more
vigilantism I'm not recommending it I'm
just predicting it and I think you're
going to see
um well really vigilantism of juries
there there are there are cases that I
would beg to be on the jury
which has never been the case before
I would beg to be on the jury oh I do
have a I I do have one topic I I forgot
this is a good one so don't go away
the topic I forgot
was uh gun control
and I asked the provocative question how
many murders by God are caused by
Republicans
and a bunch of people tried to give me
data that was complete so what
they tried to do was say oh here all the
murders in a place that's mostly
Republicans
and here are all the murders in a place
that's mostly Democrats so we're just
going to guess that the murderers are
similar to the population in general
so probably mostly Republicans murdering
in the Republican places yeah I'll get
there hold on I'll get there and and
probably mostly Democrats are doing the
murdering in the Democrat places right
no of course not now I'm pretty sure if
you go to the Republican places it's
still the Democrats murdering
they're just fewer of them
um
and so I wanted to propose a half-baked
idea right now I don't believe that any
of the Second Amendment loving people
will like this idea so this is an
example of what I call the bad version
of an idea
so I'm going to give you a bad version
which you will see obvious problems with
the biggest one is Second Amendment
say and I'm not denying that it has
problems but I want to see if this
causes you to maybe imagine a different
way we could go about it right so this
is sort of brainstorming imagination
creativity exercise all right don't get
too serious about the recommendation it
goes like this
I have a hypothesis
that people who are invested in the
system meaning the United States
don't do as much murdering
and that you could determine who is
invested in the system by their
activities so you don't need to read
anybody's mind
here would be activities in which I
would bet that almost well no let me
rephrase I would bet that people who
engage in the following activities
rarely murder they do
but rarely
activity number one serving on a jury
being a juror on a jury even once
my hypothesis is if you've done it even
once
you're probably not a murderer
you know anybody can murder in a crime
of passion but probably not a criminal
murder you know the criminals will
probably just try to get out of it one
way or the other
likewise if you registered to vote
and then you actually voted at least
once
I would say your odds of being a
murderer are very low
would you agree I would say that if you
took a gun safety class
just once your odds of ever being a
murderer are very low
very low and what do all those things
have in common all those things have in
common is buying into the system
is somebody who says I like the system
and I'm going along with it serving on a
jury trial is something you can so
easily get out of
that I think the people who do I have at
least a little bit of sense of community
and civilization I know I did by the way
I I highly recommend
serving on a jury
do not spend your whole life getting on
a jury duty do not
because it will change you in a in a way
that you can't imagine it changes you
serving on a jury Makes You Different
forever
and the way it makes you different is
you see your you see 12 people who
really give it their best shot that's
what I saw so I've done two two or three
but uh when you see that your fellow
citizens are really really serious about
getting it right that changes everything
yeah yeah you have to have that
experience
right exception DC
all right so here's where I'm going
there are uh there are activities like
joining the NRA taking a gun safety
class voting being on a jury which
pretty much guarantee that you're in the
unlikely to murder somebody class
suppose we said
you have to do at least one of those
things to get a gun
I know I know Second Amendment I get it
if you want to reject it just on the
Second Amendment no argument
if you want to be an absolutist in the
Second Amendment no argument no argument
you don't have to even say it no
argument
but I'm just trying to expand your
thinking a little bit
you know is there any way
that you could say we're going to give
you very simple you know bar to to pass
let's say gun safety is nearly free well
the gun costs money so people have money
if they buy a gun you say you just can't
have it unless you take a gun safety
class
or you can't have it unless you've
registered to vote or you've been on a
jury trial
now it can't press I know it can't pass
any constitutional test I get it but is
there anything you could do
where you could restrict guns in any way
to people who have bought into the
system
you don't have to say shall not be
infringed
you're just preaching to the choir we
all know Second Amendment now I I get
that the idea is a Dead on Arrival
I just wonder if it
maybe stimulates your thinking in any
way that would be useful
because uh now now imagine taking it out
of the Practical range and putting it
into the uh political domain all right
so everything I was talking about was
looking for something like a practical
idea but there wasn't one there
but what if you took that into the
political domain
and you said because Republicans have a
tough time explaining why people should
have guns when the news is showing
people getting gunned down every day
right now there is an argument and it's
a perfect argument but it's
takes a while to you know present it so
it doesn't work as well as hey these
people are being shot you know that's
always going to be more attention
grabbing
so
um if you're a
Republican politician
and you suggested
that the Democrats who want gun control
could voluntarily uh
restricted to other people who want gun
control that you would favor it
that everybody who votes for gun control
should be denied a gun
uh and if they don't vote at all they
should be denied a gun
but if you do vote
and you do vote for guns you could have
one
so basically everybody who's against gun
ownership doesn't get to have one
because they happen to be the same class
of people who use them illegally
Republicans are in favor of guns but
show me an NRA member Republican who
murdered somebody
with a gun
Shelby Shelby that
I mean you know it doesn't happen I mean
if it may have maybe has happened in
some rare cases but it basically doesn't
happen
so why can't the Republicans just to
make a point right this would just be
making a point it really wouldn't work
as a policy or anything just say how
about this
Republicans who have
you know taken a gun class or joined the
NRA have never been a problem to anybody
in fact they probably are protecting you
so why don't we say they can have all
the guns they want
and you can't
now nobody's going to agree to that
right the Democrats are never going to
agree oh yeah if we identify as
Democrats we'll agree to not have guns
um but in terms of framing the
framing it
it would be devastating
I mean you'd have to pretend you really
believed it as I mean it would be
anti-second Amendment so it'll never fly
but I can imagine putting it out there
and just making somebody have to have to
deal with it say you know that it's not
the Republicans right
so how about the Republicans get to keep
their guns because within the Republican
realm there doesn't seem to be a problem
um do you know who do you know what
class of citizens are allowed to carry a
knife
into almost any public situation and yet
have basically no murders
and yet they get to they are allowed to
carry a weapon
yeah the Sikhs right if you're in the
Sikh religion
part of the religion is you're supposed
to carry a dagger that's my
understanding and so I believe they've
won correct me if I'm wrong but I
believe they've won legal challenges to
allow them to carry their weapon
into places where you're definitely not
supposed to have a weapon
uh not every place of course but in more
places than you would expect and here's
my question how many Sikhs are murdering
people with their daggers
zero
zero right have you I've never even
heard of it have you ever heard of one
seek
who just took out his dagger and like
mugged somebody
it just doesn't happen
so that there's a special case where the
Sikhs and my my opinion have Superior
constitutional rights to you
and I'm okay with it
I mean I can't I can't imagine saying
that in any other context there's a
religious group that's a superior
constitutional or at least legal right
over me
I can't carry I can't carry a knife to
the same place as they can
but I don't have a problem with that at
all you know I don't have a problem with
that because no Sikhs are using their
knives they're just not using them so in
a practical sense it's a perfect
practical it's a practical solution
so if the Sikhs can have knives and
other people can't in some domains not
every domain
you telling me you couldn't do that with
guns we already have a precedent the
precedent is set
it's a better case than you think it's
not I don't think it'll ever apply but
I'd like to be thinking in different
terms
you know maybe there's a way to
segregate the public in a way that makes
sense and even the public would agree
with I don't know
I just feel like there's some way to
break the Log Jam and let the
Republicans keep all their guns
and maybe let the other people work it
out some other way
all right
uh I would I I'd probably just be happy
if anybody voted
honestly if anybody registered to vote
I'd say they could have a gun
because it means they bought into the
system
now I realize that criminals would
probably register to vote
just to get a gun
but uh not a lot of them
all right so YouTube thanks for joining
I'll talk to you tomorrow
