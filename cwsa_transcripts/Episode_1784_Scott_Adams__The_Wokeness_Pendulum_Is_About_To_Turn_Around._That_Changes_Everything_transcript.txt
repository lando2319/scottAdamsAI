good morning
and welcome
to an experience that i think you're
gonna call
later i don't know
you'll have a lot of words for it you'll
say spectacular
hard to describe orgasmic perhaps
but let me tell you
you have stumbled onto or possibly
through your own good work
you you have come upon
the high point
of human civilization it's called coffee
with scott adams everybody's talking
about it
and it begins with something called the
simultaneous sip have you heard of it
yes
it's sweeping the
live streams
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tanker chalice or stein a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of
really any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day
it's the thing that's going to make
everything better
it's called simultaneous hip it happens
now go
oh
god
well
are you in for a treat today
because today the the news served up
little golden nuggets for us
you know some days it's just herds it's
nothing but turds
but today
nuggets
golden
here's the first one did you think there
was any way that the january 6 hearing
committee
could make themselves
look more absurd
and less credible were you thinking to
yourself
i don't think there's anything they
could do i mean really i'm going to
brainstorm a little bit but like what
they could
wear clown faces
no that wouldn't change much
what could they really really do
to look more ridiculous
and less credible
than they have already looked
and then i look at the news today and it
turns out that
sean penn will attend the january 6
hearings
well i guess me
apparently there was a way to to be more
ridiculous
now
let me be fair
i like sean penn
and i actually like the fact
that he's an activist
he does seem to put his own body and
reputation and probably money of some
amount
uh
into causes
so i would say he's not like the regular
hollywood people right
i like the hollywood people who are who
are
you know really
putting their sleeves up and
getting involved
that's why i like melissa milano even
though i disagreed with practically
everything she said
i always had full respect for her
because she
i mean she was a full participant who
also happened to be famous for something
else those those kind i like
because i think i'm you know a minor
version of that so i want to defend
myself i suppose but if you're actually
trying to help
we should be happy about it it doesn't
matter that you also were a good actor
at one point
that said the way the the way the public
will view the january 6th thing
when you add a professional actor
is that it's theater
am i wrong
what does your brain say
when you say well today's uh
today's broadcast will be the january 6
hearings and this episode will feature
sean patton
sean penn will be making a
a celebrity appearance on the january 6
earrings
uh those will be broadcast on all the
major networks
am i right it's just the association
is the only thing that could have made
it look more ridiculous
even though like i said i respect sean
penn he does the work
all right
there's a i saw a clay travis tweet
in which he was tweeting a video i'm not
sure who made it but it was 10 minutes
of democrats saying elections had been
stolen
10 minutes
but each of the clips
you know the the clips are very short
but it's just yeah everybody from
uh you know
hillary clinton to everybody lots of
pundits saying that the election had
been stolen
in some election in which a republican
won it was more than one election
and when you see 10 minutes of it solid
democrats saying this election was
stolen
it just reminds you who controls
the propaganda machine in this country
it's got to be the left
because
it is just generally true that whoever
loses thinks the election was stolen
and it's always been that way
it's just always been that way when you
lose you're like
i think that election was stolen
so maybe it's not a left or right thing
but they sold us to sold it to us as
uh if you say it and you're on the right
you're supporting the insurrections
well i did a long thread yesterday on an
idea that i'd already shared on a live
stream here so you've heard it the idea
was that trump
instead of running for president
starts a media
let's say debate
centered
media entity in which he would host
debates on major topics
it would just be a big event and it
would support truth social and it would
allow him to run air cover
for somebody like desantis
just as an example
and
it's interesting if if you look at how
people responded to the tweet
there were a lot of people who liked it
you know they would check the heart
but very few people would retweet it
why is that
i think average people are afraid of
trump
or trump supporters i think an average
person who is a trump supporter
who sees this idea and says yeah
actually trump
would be even better
as the person who helps us beat the fake
news monopoly
like that that would be a higher calling
than president which is sort of a rerun
in his case
so a lot of people
responded to the idea by saying yeah i
like it enough to hit the like button
but i'm a little concerned about
retweeting it
because it suggests that trump would
have a higher role than even being
president
but it would be different than being
president so and
i'll tell you one of the things that's
sort of emerging in my
understanding of things
is that a lot of trump supporters just
want revenge
or whereas one person put it vindication
basically just to see trump win to say
okay he probably won the other time too
you know
so here we go i told you biden was a
mistake
you know now
now i'm i'm right so a lot of this is
about being right getting revenge
vindication
ego
and
i want to contrast that with something
that i've said publicly a bunch of times
that when i supported trump in 2016
it was because privately i don't think i
said it as much during 2016.
but after the fact i'll tell you
privately i wanted him to break
everything
because i thought we were just becoming
a constipated nation i thought the
republic
the republic was just constipated
they just couldn't do anything anymore
but we're really good at fixing stuff
am i
right we're really bad at like improving
things that have ossified
but if you break the end of
everything
we can put things together better
better than maybe anybody any culture
all right i'm gonna be a little you know
american-centric here
but i think america could probably put
things back together
better than anybody
we're really good at creating
but you can't create if your atmosphere
is in everything stuck
and that was the world that
called trump basically i don't think
trump decided to be the president i
think the world called him
because it said everything's stuck
we need somebody who'll just break the
 out of everything
and then we'll fix it
so i think he did that to some extent
right and maybe some people would want
more of it but i think for sure he broke
the
the news
meaning that there was a fake news
industry
that was really controlling the people
almost like that movie the matrix
i mean i felt like we were in the matrix
because we believed the news
and we didn't quite understand how
illegitimate it was
and then trump comes along and he
basically you know pulled up the cover
and said all right look what they're
doing to me
you can see it right in front of your
eyes look what they're saying about me
right now
and then look with your own eyes here's
the transcript i mean he never said
those words but that was that was the
effect
the effect was he proved to us
that everything we knew about everything
was wrong
because it came from the news
and the news is just made up
propaganda
and so he did break everything in terms
of our mental models
would you accept that
he didn't break the systems which is
probably a good thing
he broke all the ways we think about
them
right
the way you think about the world is
really different
because of just you know the the
conflict he brought the
you know the the mental destruction
that he was like he was like a
psychological
bulldozer and it didn't matter
what th what you were thinking before he
got there he just bulldozed your
thoughts away
and then said hey
about this idea and you might have loved
it and you might have hated it
but all of your other stuff got
bulldozed away and now you were talking
about his stuff
so it was a really fundamental
destruction of the american mind and
maybe global i don't know but far more
of the american mind
so i got what i wanted i wanted
destruction
he delivered it
now the second part
is can we fix it
that's what my idea was about
my idea is that if we could form some
kind of a
a system or a model
in which you could have
good information delivered to the public
without the propaganda in other words a
fair debate debate with experts but
here's the important part
it has to be interesting
it has to be provocative has to be
entertaining
we we've never really had anybody who
could do those two things
you know
trump
could bring the seriousness
and the entertainment at the same time
name one other person who could do that
nobody all right i'll short i'll
shortcut that nobody can do that he's
the only one
and
that's the thing that needs to get fixed
because if we don't understand stuff
such as
yeah is nuclear energy good for us or
bad for us
imagine if we'd had
uh let's say more effective
fair news for the last 20 years do you
think we would have an energy problem
right now
if the news business worked
i would say no
because if the news business worked
it would have been a long time ago that
people said you know
we really should keep these nuclear
plants running
we figured out how to keep the nuclear
waste on the site that produced it
because i mean that can't be that much
worse than
you know what was already there at least
in people's minds it's not that much
worse
and so to solve the psychology of where
does this waste go that was solved how
many people knew it
you don't have to take it uh you know
some yucatan mountain or something just
store it on site
and how about the danger of the nuclear
plants
we were all 20 years behind in our
knowledge of it we thought that the
um let's see is it um
version two
gen two
i think generation one is the only one
that's had meltdowns and we're on
generation three
which has never had a belt though
never
nowhere
so that the the technology that we use
for nuclear
power now
has already solved
the big problems and it's been a while
it solved them for a while
so if the news had been telling us that
from the start
instead of saying
hey look at greta because this is more
interesting
wouldn't we have electricity now oh
i'm looking at the comments rogue got
overturned
well did that just change my show
yeah i assume you can confirm that over
on youtube or over on the locals
platform the comments are faster
row is just overturned all right
well then you weren't even listening to
what i said were you
wow live live streaming
this is kind of cool
now uh can somebody tell me in the
comments so i don't have to look at it
myself
it was the actual ruling the same as the
draft
the actual and the draft were the same
does anybody know yet or is it too soon
uh alito was the majority opposing what
um
bro say uh just looking at your comments
too early to now all right well that's
interesting
uh the opinion is on 213 pages so i
guess we'll find out if any of it
changed
wow
so they pick a friday
um
when does the supreme court
session end
pretty soon or is this it
and what was it
5'4 next week it ends okay so it
happened just as people said it would
all right so
one of the things
six three
it was a 6-3 decision okay
um
i guess we expected that right
so
um
that's interesting
so here are the some of the things we've
learned from that number one
uh when you see a draft opinion that
looks that complete
maybe it's the actual opinion
or it will be
the second thing is
did that just uh
guarantee that the democrats will keep
power
so now the democrats have
now the democrats have the supreme court
two issues right they've got the gun
issue
the new york
supreme court decision about
concealed carry in new york making it
okay to do a concealed carry in new york
according to the supreme court
now and then this
so
these are the two things that of course
you know
conservatives would want a lot
but
it's going to be expensive
because it might affect the election do
you think this will affect the midterms
and then
2024 i think it would affect the
midterms more
i'm saying yes's ann knows a little is
sort of mixed
um
so the states still have laws on
abortion so the states can do what they
want now that's that's the point of
taking the federal government out of it
no effect on midterms
i don't know
we'll find out
scott sounds a tad disappointed about
what
do i sound disappointed
about what
i'm not sure which topic you're on that
i allegedly sound disappointed in
maybe i just sound disappointed
but uh
now i i feel like it would be ridiculous
to talk about anything else because this
is the only thing anybody's going to
talk about today i have such a good show
planned
but now it's irrelevant isn't it because
you only want to think about that
um wrong on this scott only 19
i don't know what 19 is
213 page ruling
all right well
we'll get back to that
uh james is saying scott doesn't care
about abortion as an issue no that's not
true
now well
let me clarify
it's always hard to
it's always hard to summarize somebody
else's opinion if it's even a little bit
complex because nobody's gonna like your
summarization
right
my opinion of abortion
is not that i don't care
my opinion is i'm not a person who
should be part of the decision
in other words i think that i
i make the decision-making process worse
by participating
now if you think that you make it better
by participating
then
you have every right
i wouldn't talk you out of it
i'm just talking about my own my own
moral ethical decision now somebody's
saying that i'm being a coward no i'm
being consistent
let me explain it in the simplest way
the reason i don't participate in that
question
is the same reason i wouldn't want a
woman to tell me if boys should get
vasectomies or
if
if boys should be
circumcised
so let me let me explain it
if there's a question that is specific
to men's bodies
i don't want to hear a woman
talk to me about it
at all
stay away from my body
how about how about the men will decide
what we do with our bodies
because we have more appreciation and
it's this is some kind of hypothetical
situation
how about you stay the away from
our bodies with both of your opinions
and your tools
and i in turn
will stay the away from your body
is that not fair
how's that not fair
so somebody says that you know like i'm
afraid to get into the issue
seriously
you think that's bothering me
not at all i'm just trying to be
consistent for the first time you know
that you've ever seen it in your life
maybe that's why it throws you when
people are consistent people are like oh
i don't know what i'm seeing here
what if the baby is male
that's an interesting debate point but
i'm not really sure
worth focusing on
somebody says as a father i don't agree
my wife should be able to abort my child
okay
then jump right in there with your
opinion
and i'm and by the way
if i were in that situation that was
described
then maybe i would think i had something
to say about
maybe i don't know i'm not in that
situation
so at the moment i'm not and i don't
plan to be so
i take myself out
all right
um
here was an article in the wall street
journal
and brit hume uh summarized it this way
and i was gonna say this in public too
and i have to uh chastise myself
because the only reason i didn't
is that i thought i would be mocked
now i'm not really
driven by embarrassment
but i just didn't want the bother
you know the trolls come in they're like
i don't know it's like extra work
so
i'm chastising myself for not doing
something that was worth doing
i just didn't want the extra work
but hume uh did
and he tweeted uh about the new the wall
street journal article he said and this
is about january 6. he said far from
proving trump nearly blew up our
democracy the testimony has shown his
effort collapsed because republican
officials who voted for him refused to
go along
now that's pretty close to what i've
been thinking and it goes like this
what did what did you learn from the
hearing so far
i learned something that i didn't know
and and let me ask you did you know this
what i learned from the hearings
is that trump had no support for
keeping office
if the system
even even if it were flawed
even if flawed
every republican in the room
his own family
he didn't have support from his own
family
you know as soon as you saw that don jr
was saying shut this down
that should have been the end of the
conversation
right you know as soon as you saw ivanka
said well i thought bill barr was
probably right about that
we should have been done talking about
this completely
trump
didn't even have the support
of his children
and you know why
because his children are smart
and they agreed with
every other republican apparently who
was close to him and had any power
nobody wanted any part of it now that's
what i learned
now you did learn that there were
lawyers
lawyers keyword lawyers
who were providing him an argument for
keeping power
that's what lawyers are
they're the people who give you the
argument
that will allow you to get what you want
it's their job
to tell you how to weasel the system
it's not their job to not weasel
they're paid weasels and i say this with
complete respect because if they do a
good job of it
that's why you hired him
you know you you could hate what mark
elias and his his folks did
changing some election rules before the
election
but it was legal
and it was kind of awesome
you could hate how it turned out if
you're on the other side
but if it made a difference
that's why you pay lawyers
because they can get some stuff done
so
uh what i got out of it that i literally
didn't know
is that
the base of support for trump
keeping power
was so weak it was basically
non-existent
and we spent four years
listening to democrats say
that it was sort of a fact
that trump had the support that was sort
of
fanatical
uh
and it was republicans who would
suddenly violate the constitution
to keep their hero worship guy in power
and and the democrats sold that
primarily to each other
because i feel like democrats believed
it because they were telling each other
but
let me ask you this
how many of you who are are republican
so you have to be republican to answer
this question right
how many of you who are republican
would have ever supported throwing the
constitution away
to keep trump in power
now i get that you wanted more uh more
visibility on the election
separate issue
you know demanding visibility on
election demanding audits demanding a
delay to make sure who won
how many of you
if let's say there had been a delay and
let's say that somehow the election had
been audited
and let's say you were satisfied
that that the audit actually did prove
that trump lost
and let's say they'll say you knew it
you're like oh well i was pretty sure he
won but
this this is a very credible audit
people even audited the audit and
now i'm sure he lost hypothetically
let's say that happened
and you're a republican
do you really want him to keep power
anyway because you like his policies
i feel like that's not one republican
anywhere ever like none have ever been
born
who would ever have that feeling and yet
yet the democrats sold that
like that was just obvious and
observable i mean just look at it they
would say look at those big crowds
they're chanting they're wearing his hat
they'll do anything he wants
not even close to true
not only not only was it not close to
true but
didn't you all know that
i'm not the only one who knew that right
you all knew that you all knew
that zero republicans would support a
man over the constitution
you knew that
because that is almost the definition of
what a republican is a republican is
somebody who's gonna favor the you know
the constitution
over just about everything
like that's the whole freaking point
right
so
it's amazing that they sold that and
and it's it's equally amazing i think
and i credit you know brett hume for
pointing this out having you know more
guts than i did
uh
that that's actually
the only thing i got out of it the only
thing i got out of it is how right i was
that there was never any risk of uh
insurrection
because because what if
you know now that we know even if these
insurrectionists had
what taken control of a room
a room in a building
with no weapons and that like even if
they succeeded and said this is our room
we take over the country
you need every one of those advisors to
trump or at least most of them to at
least say yeah yeah
good on you for
violently or
in some cases
getting into our capital i don't think
any of them said that
has there been one
one person who's not a lawyer
who
was really trying to
literally do an insurrection there's
zero evidence that right
so if you ask me the january 6th thing
has proven to the country
that there was not only was there no uh
insurrection attempt
but it was never even possible
and everyone knew it
that's what i'm getting
are you you know of course that's my
biased lens on this but
that's not that bad is it
i mean is that unbiased or is that
closer to closer to neutral
i know i i feel like it's neutral but
i'm also aware of the fact that i would
have a bias there
i don't know it's hard to judge myself
and i don't think you're necessarily a
better judge either but it's hard to
know if that's an objective opinion
isn't it
what do you think
i don't know
that this is one of those situations
where i'm completely aware that i would
not be able to judge my own opinion
i i think that the january 6 proved that
there was no risk
but i could be wrong
all right
there's big news about you know
people making fun of bite in his little
cheat sheet did you see that item
so he had a little uh cheat sheet for
some event
and on it was you know one bullet point
at a time
saying what was going to happen and then
also what parts he was supposed to do
and he was being mocked because they
would um the sentences some of them
started with uh uppercase
emphasized you
you
introduced the speaker
you
go to your seat and sit down
now he's being mocked for that
i have to defend him on this
i have to defend him
if you've spent any time doing public
events
this is what you want
he's just well prepared
i'm just going to give an a-plus to his
staff
you know this is complete this story is
completely backwards this story should
have been biden has a good staff
this is exactly what i want you to give
to me if i'm running for president or
i'm president i want my staff to give me
this let me tell you why
right
prior to biden walking into that room
how much thought did he give to the
event
he should have given none that would be
the right amount
because if he's just going to go in and
say some words and leave then you know
it's not a debate
you should put the least amount of
effort into that as possible
and his staff
has done literally everything
you could tell by this cheat sheet to
make his thinking
zero
now the way you've interpreted this
is
the way you've interpreted it
is that he's so incompetent and his
staff knows it that they have to like
treat him like a baby
possible
possible
but
let me
let me tell you that when any time any
like
famous person or a public figure
has lots of events
do you know what the support people
would try to do really and they'll
really try hard they'll try to remove
all of your other thinking
it's a service
they try to remove all of your thinking
so that you can only think on things
that you know your brain is
important for
so
the the part where it says you
take your seat here's why that's
important if you saw on there take your
seat
would you interpret it as oh i'm
supposed to tell everybody to take your
seat
or would you interpret it as
you just go take your seat and somebody
else will take care of the opening
remarks
you actually do need to be that clear
it's very important that his notes said
you take your saint
that really does help
so this story is completely backwards
all right and the reason the reason i
defend biden every now and then
is because
you have to understand it's both sides
doing this nonsense
now here's the defense
the defense could be this
trump wouldn't need that
right
trump didn't need it i'll bet obama
didn't need it
but it would be useful
i would need it i wouldn't say i would
need it but i would i would find it
useful
if somebody gave it to me i'd say oh
good job
but trump was a different character
trump could go into any room without
preparation
and somehow make it work right and that
was his specific skill
you could throw trump into any room
any room
it doesn't matter what's happening and
he makes it work so he wouldn't need to
have the you know the perfection he
could just say uh who says this all
right you're you're up here next
and then he would just you know
orchestrate it and everything would be
fine and if he didn't like the way other
people were orchestrating it trump would
have said no you you do this over here
all right well i'll read this you did it
and he would he would have just
he would have turned it into what he
wanted to do
so he never had to tell him what to do
because he's you know such a
micro manager he would just do what he
wanted to do anyway
so
i defend biden on that all right
um
i'm watching the inter the uh collision
i guess of wokeness versus title ix now
title ix is what
gave young female athletes
the same resources for sports as boys at
and so it's been hugely successful
so female sports uh
are like way up
since before title nine
and uh
it's been you know an entirely positive
thing so could we all agree
i'm not sure if you do actually
i guess i'll find out do we all agree
that title ix
did what it was trying to do
it promoted
female
sportsmanship and stuff and uh that it
worked
yes
yeah say yes
i mean i i'm sure that probably
conservatives or somebody else argued
against it back in this day but it
worked
all right so
here's another thing i'm in favor of
wokeness you don't like it so much
my complaint with wokeness is it just
goes too far
it's sort of unforgiving
so but i don't have a problem with
referring to people in the way they
would like to be referred i consider
that just good manners
but
wokeness which i like not the extreme
version
and title ix which i like
have a little bit of a problem
don't they
because it's hard to be in favor of both
of them
here's why
athletes are the opposite of oldness
when you
when you say hey let's let's have a
let's have a system
that really supports
worshiping the best athletes because
that's what sports do it ends up being
about the good athletes right it's
really
reward goes to the good athletes
here's the problem what makes somebody a
good athlete
it's kind of how you were born
now you're going to say no it's not just
how you were born it's also
hard work and
and practice and and all that to which i
say do you know what makes a person work
hard
and it's probably the way they were born
sorry it's probably all the way you were
born
i have i have a uh
a good work ethic
meaning that
i'm willing to work hard to get what i
want and always have been i was born
that way i worked hard in first grade i
mean just always
there's no way in hell i learned that
i was just born into it
and there's no way in hell people who
just don't have that
learn to be lazy or something it's just
part of what you're born with it's just
your chemistry my chemistry makes me
stand up some other people's chemistry
says stay on the couch a little bit
longer mine won't let me it's not like i
thought it through and decided that
standing up was better i just have
different chemistry
so it says scott is jealous of athletes
to which i say of course
of course i would be jealous of anybody
who had any gift that i didn't have
i mean it's not going to change my life
but
in in the conceptual way i wish i'd have
those things as well
so that would be fair a fair statement
but here's my problem
um wokeness is about
treating everybody with the same level
of respect here's my own definition
treating everybody with the same level
of respect no matter what their
situation is
is that fair
that wokeness is about treating
everybody with the same level of respect
and access of course
no matter how they were born what their
situation is so that that captures you
know everything from lgbtq
to
you know any racial stuff religious
stuff
you know handicaps
or different ableness whatever is the
better term
um
so here we have some people supporting a
system which worships people's genetic
superiority which is title ix and really
anything involved with sports not just
title ix
and then at the same time supporting the
thing that's the opposite of that which
is no no it's not how you're born
like we're all equal value
they are opposites
it and what i like about this is that
if you can hold the opinion
that we should be worshiping athletes
but also we should be woke
you don't make any sense at all i don't
think
to me
so here's my point of view
i feel that i i'm consistent
and the consistent thing is i think
everybody's the same value
people are suited for different
functions
some people can lift heavy objects some
people can write supreme court decisions
so you know definitely people are suited
for certain functions
but my own view is everybody has the
same worth and if you add any other view
it's just
it just makes everything not work
so it's just a practical view
um
and i take that to athletes they're fun
to watch
but worshiping him was like worshiping
luck
because they didn't ask to be born that
way they were just born with a certain
set of gifts
including
the opportunity to use them
luck
including
the
the hard work
that's probably genetic
i saw a video in which some doctor was
saying that the triple vaxxed are the
most likely to die from covid
what do you think of that
do you think that's true first of all
that the triple vaxxed are the most
likely to die from covid
so that's pretty scary right
and there's there's a related story
that the
people who get cancer treatments
i don't know if you know this this might
be breaking news for some of you but the
people who get cancer treatments are the
most likely to die from cancer
did you know that
the people who get cancer treatments are
the most likely to die
from cancer
do you know why
it's because people who don't have
cancer don't get cancer treatments
if you didn't see that coming
with vaccinations here's the question
one must ask and maybe it's been
answered but i didn't see it
who is most likely not in every case
not in every case we're only talking
statistics we're not talking individuals
as soon as you tell me about the
individual who made an individual
decision we're on a different topic
you're talking about individuals i'm
talking about the average only the
average completely
selectively exclusively the average and
when you try to i know you're gonna i
know you're gonna say but i know a
person no
no no no different topic
on average
who's likely to get triple vaxxed would
it be somebody who's at high risk
yes
old people
overweight people
people with five co-morbidities they're
vastly the piss out of themselves
because
they think their odds are better that
way now who is most likely to die from
covet
whether they're vaxxed or not it's got
to be the old people and the fat people
and all the same people who have been
dying before right
so
should you be alarmed that the people
who are triple vaxxed are also the ones
dying at the highest rate
i think that's just what you'd expect
if the vaccinations worked really well
but not a hundred percent
so let's not call them vaccinations
let's call them
shots
so if if the kovid shots were 100
effective you know that that'd be
terrific but they're not
all right
um enough about that
so just be aware of your statistics
because it's entirely possible that
uh the shots are helping people
but they're still dying
more than they should
maybe
i don't know i mean how would i know
all right
here's a provocative tweet that i
tweeted today that got way less pushback
than i was expecting but i think it
hasn't broken out of my bubble yet
you know there's some tweets that get a
positive response
because your followers see them and then
you get one non-follower
who sees and says oh i take that a
little differently and then then it
leaves your bubble and then the trolls
come in i mean that's sort of the
pattern
but the trolls hadn't come in yet
when i tweeted this i said if things get
much worse in the u.s
men will take back leadership of the
country
now
i'll explain myself so you know the
context of that moment but it was meant
to be provocative right obviously it was
meant to provoke
but it's also a real point and i'll tell
you the real point in a moment
but here's the thing that surprised me
the number of women who agreed with
the number of women women
who said that it was a big mistake to
give women the right to vote
now i think they're half kidding
but maybe half not i don't know i can't
tell
you you can see some of the comments uh
some women are saying i agree
now i'm not going to go that far of
course
but here's what i meant when i said if
things get much worse in the u.s
men will take back leadership of the
country
number one
because i'm very woke
let me specify that when i say men
i don't mean their genitalia
right when i say men i mean there's
there's a male way of being
that and you know encompasses a certain
set of traits but you could be a woman
who has those traits you could be
identified as anything you want and also
have those traits so it's the traits i'm
talking about
but i hope you'll appreciate that i made
every topic about trans
can can you give me a hand at home
i made this about trans and i promised i
would
um and there's one thing that the
january 6
if i hadn't mentioned this before one
thing that the january 6 hearings is
missing
not enough trans
angles on that
in fact i don't think it's even been
mentioned once in the whole january 6.
and i would like to point out that the
the committee the congressional
committee
has no trans members
zero
so that's a little bit on that the
democrats
all right um but what i was saying was
uh
when i'm talking about uh if things get
much worse in the u.s men will take back
leadership when i say men
just put that into uh sort of mom and
dad traditional stereotypes it's just a
way to shorthand it
so it doesn't really mean gender
but here's what i mean
traditionally
um would you say that it's often true
that in a household
mom seems to be in charge
like mom is making the calls you know
you know
what what are the kids eating and who's
doing what when fairly typical right
now i'm not saying you should be that
way that's that's not the point i'm just
saying on average
it seems like mom is mostly in charge in
the house
but
will will you go with me the extra mile
and agree with the following
the reason mom can be in charge
is because dad
already did his job
dad
kept you safe enough
that you could go about your business
dad's job is to keep the mongol hordes
from coming and raping and killing you
and if you're and if mom is making
decisions about what you're having for
dinner
dad did his job
right and again
dad doesn't mean male or female i'm just
saying you know the relationships tend
to have a protector
and then you know maybe a an operator
you know the operator seems to be in
charge but they can't do
the operator is dead
unless
dad
kept you safe
so what's happening in the in the united
states right now what's happening in
america
is dad doing his job
is dad keeping you safe
 no
 no
dad is gone
we're we're like a single mom country
now
are we
it's like the country turned into a
single mother
situation
dad is just gone
do you know why dad is gone
he got insulted out of the house
wasn't appreciated
said it
i don't need this
i think i'll just go do some drugs
not appreciated
here's a uh
here's a related uh trend that i see in
california
i don't know if you've seen it there
do you know anybody who's an
american-born person male or female
who won't even date somebody who was
born and raised in america
have you seen that
i've seen it and it feels like it's or
i'm seeing some yeses
and there's a reason isn't there
do you know what the reason is
men are appreciated
that's it
every other culture appreciates men
it's only an american culture that
demonizes men
so do you know what men did
they went on strike
you just didn't know it
the men let you take over
again that sounded sexist but remember
i'm not talking about gender here i'm
just using a shorthand for a vibe
yeah
dad said you
dad said
um
we had a deal
dad said we had a deal you just broke
the deal
so
you're on your own
so dad's missing
now all i'm saying is that if you don't
get dad back the whole thing falls apart
or somebody who's willing to be dead
what was trump
trump was dead
and what happened when dad tried to come
back and dad actually fixed a few things
dad made things better in north korea
dad made energy work
dad made the economy work dad was
helping on the border some say didn't do
enough but obviously better than biden
right
so what happened when dad
came back
and dad did his job and dad made you
safer
what the happened to dad
well you dad
you dad again you disrespected
dad now
he brought a lot of it on himself
let's be honest
you made it easy
right yeah you can't you can't support
trump whatsoever
in any honest way without saying well he
did make the attacks on him a little bit
easy too okay
so you know there's no perfection going
on with anybody here
let's be honest but he did bring the dad
energy and it did it did the dad thing
in many areas but he was drummed down
he was drummed out
can you imagine there might be a you
know
a trump-like figure in a different
culture
imagine somebody who had let's say
trump's characteristics
but was maybe running for election in a
central or south american country
do you think you would have been drummed
out for just being him
probably not
probably not
so it feels to me
that
there may be a pendulum move here
and that even
maybe even especially
women are seeing it
that
they they drove dad out
they made it a bad deal to be a dad
basically made it a bad deal to even
protect you so
if you don't get it back
we're in trouble but i think the
pendulum will just naturally swing back
and i do think that you're going to see
something that
sexist people would describe as more of
a
male approach to things i mean you take
any you if you take any topic
don't you feel like you can
sense the male versus the female
approach
i think the democrats are basically the
party of women
well let me test this with you i've said
this before but i don't know if you
agree with it
i say the democrats are the party of
women
who are trying to be a bigger tenth than
that and you know including including a
lot of minority rights in general
but it's basically women
and then the women
tell everybody else what's going to
happen
right i mean even black lives matter was
primarily a woman-run organization
and
all right
i'm sure i had some point there that i
was going to
make
um
so rafsenberger
uh the what was he uh in georgia he was
the uh what was his title rafsenberger
was a
secretary of state what was he
secretary of state right so he was in
charge of elections there and then the
january 6 people were talking to him and
here's a quote from him
that i saw in the wall street journal
and so he was he was the in georgia
uh so he said in testimony in testimony
tuesday mr rosenberger a republican
said audits of the state's election
results showed no evidence of widespread
fraud
and then rasenburger said the numbers
are the numbers he said the numbers
don't lie
the numbers don't lie
what planet is he on
the numbers is how you lie
that's like saying words don't lie no
words are the things you used to lie
numbers are the other thing you used to
lie
you know hammers don't
you know uh
anyway you don't need any analogies
but
let me clarify
all right so here's somebody who was
elected and was responsible for like a
major you know fundamental part of our
republic the election
in a key place
and he would tell us in public the
numbers don't lie well you mother
 idiot
video lies
video lies
photographs lie
data is the biggest liar we've
ever met
politicians lie
we don't have anything that doesn't lie
all right
if you can find something in
this culture that doesn't lie
trot it out i'll take a look at it i'd
be i'm willing to be amazed but don't
stand in front of the public and tell me
that numbers don't lie
it used to be my job
to do financial analysis to decide you
know on business cases for
investing in things within the corporate
world you know should we upgrade our
systems or what
and
i was never under the impression that my
job was to tell the truth
i can't remember ever conceptualizing of
my job as to find out what was real
it never even occurred to me
like that wasn't even my mindset my
mindset was my boss would tell me what
we were going to do
and then i would make some numbers that
supported it
like the numbers are how you lie
the numbers don't lie
now uh
now he might be saying let's let's let's
say i imagine he were defending himself
he might say no i'm saying the data
you know the data is accurate
is it
how would i know
because a guy said so so
a politician
who
lies for a living
because that's sort of what they do
so a guy who lies for a living told me
the data is good
oh well i feel better now
the guy who lies for a living
politician
he's telling me that the numbers are
good
but i wonder if there are also any
lawyers who think the numbers are good
because they don't lie for oh they do
damn it
that's right lawyers life are living too
so yes we should totally believe that
all data is reliable
and in fact all the data for every
scientific study every
political event and every other realm
has been wrong
i mean all of our corona numbers were
but one thing we are assured by a
professional liar is that the one area
the one area
where the data can be accurate
is our elections so feel pretty good
about that
all right um
michael malus
twitter asks provocatively
he says not one not one person who
claimed that striking down the airline
mask mandate would lead to mass deaths
has acknowledged they were wrong or
suffered any consequences for their
now
i like that point
because
there were some people with strong
opinions about that
and i think at this point we can say
conclusively
they were 100 wrong
we can also say
that if you believed it was definitely a
good idea to keep masks on
on airlines
you're a idiot
anybody
yeah at some point right early on there
was some fog of war but at some point
if you were positive that people needed
a mask on airplanes to keep us safe well
you're a idiot
but if i'm gonna be fair
if you were sure that taking them off
would make a difference would not make a
difference
well
i don't think you were on such you know
solid ground to yourself
and i'll say it for the millionth time
you could have easily tested this
with one flight
like one regular flight let's just say
you said all right we don't know if
taking off mass is a good or bad idea so
what we're going to do
is we're going to watch one flight you
know that just say let's say it just
goes back and forth between two cities
any two cities you know maybe something
that has a few hours involved and we're
just going to watch it for one month
and if that one airline then we'll
follow up with the passengers and they
will call them and say did you get
coveted and if there's a higher rate of
people who flew that airline
we'll say whoa whoa at least we it's a
good thing we tested it we didn't let
too much covet into the world with this
one test
but now we know what we need to do
why wouldn't you do that
it's like we keep running away from
something that's so obvious which is can
you test it
well if you can test it why are we
guessing
that wouldn't be that hard to test would
it
i don't know it seems like it's very
testable and you could do it at such a
small
risk relative to the whole pandemic that
it would be certainly good to know i
mean the entire flight
business
and and travel and everything just got
shut down
for something that could have been
tested in 30 days
with pretty high reliability i think
because if you didn't find any
difference between the passengers on the
no mask flight
well aren't you done
all
right um
rasmussen had a poll asked american
public
who we think is winning ukraine or
russia
14 say ukraine is winning which is
interesting i thought it would be higher
actually
uh i'm not saying that ukraine is
winning i think it's a hybrid situation
going on there
uh 45 said stalemate
and 24 said russia is
24.
it's uh it's like close to a quarter
that's about 25
anyway um
here
here's what's wrong with the poll
i think people interpret the question
too differently in this case
in my opinion uh
who's winning or losing depends on
what time frame you're looking at and
what you thought was the goal if you say
the time frame is right now
and russia's goal was to take all of
ukraine well
they didn't get it
if you say they had strategic objectives
objectives to take over part of ukraine
and
degrade the rest and maybe take it over
later then they totally are winning
so
i i feel like it's a weird hybrid
situation where they're winning and
losing at the same time i'm not sure
that there's any smart way to answer
that question
how many people thought biden this is
also rasmussen how many people thought
biden is handling
that situation well the ukraine
situation
31 said it either excellent or good but
44 said poor
that is a stubborn 31 percent do you
remember uh
people used to say that trump
might be remembering this wrong the
trump could always get like 31 percent
there was some like solid base
that no matter what he'd have that 30
percent or so it looks like biden just
has that too so something like 30
percent of democrats and
30 percent of republicans are going to
back their candidate
no matter what's happening
does that sound about right
that about
a third
of partisans will back their own
candidate
no matter how obviously that candidate
is failing
i thought it'd be higher actually
but that's not bad 30
at least it's not the majority
the department of justice actually
issued a statement
saying it respectfully disagrees with
the supreme court ruling on
concealed guns in new york
in new york
to which i say
what does that mean
what does it mean when the department of
justice respectfully disagrees with the
supreme court ruling
is it just talk
or does it mean they're not going to
enforce it
or they're or they're going to
enforce something that the supreme court
says can't be enforced
what does it mean
it's sort of uh
like the foreshadowing of it doesn't
feel so good
i don't know
um i saw a tweet from somebody
called natural redhead
uh danielle kanye
and
she was talking about younger people
feeling doomed
um
do you feel that
she this is what her tweet said she said
i said this to my mom the other day but
but i don't think older adults realize
how outright depressed depressing it is
for millennials and gen z to keep
investing in our future
when everything is headed toward a
future that doesn't seem even remotely
bearable
so if you're a young person in america
is that why you've learned that our
future only doesn't look remotely
bearable
what
so i had to tweet back my helpful uh
context i'm pretty sure every generation
says that don't they
give me a fact check just from your own
uh experience
doesn't every generation say that the
new generation is is
and doesn't every generation think that
the older generation ruined it for them
so that it'll be worse
and isn't every generation better off
you know maybe i'm biased i don't know
i think so
you know there there are definitely um
things such as homeownership is worse in
some cases stuff like that
so are
is is it true or not true that we're
better off see here's here's the
true not true part of it because it's
it's true and not true at the same time
it's true that uh health care is better
right
we have you know more pills and
treatments and things so if you were
born today
you have way better health care and
that's a giant thing
right
uh if you're born today you if you don't
have a car well you can uber if you need
to you got like more options
so
we're probably you know safer from a lot
of disasters than we ever have been
several etc
so i have a feeling that things actually
improve
just consistently
but we always think this is the last
generation and it's going to be ruined
and maybe maybe we'll be right one of
these days
here's the story that surprised me a
little bit stacey abrams who
narrowly narrowly lost the governorship
in georgia
um but is sort of a rising star in the
democrat party she's uh she's very vocal
about being
pro-funding police
and uh
and when someone asked her about it she
said i was never not
pro police and so she's
putting forth some
beefy proposals to raise the pay of the
police locally where she is and
and basically just full-throated
support the police
now
surprising right democrat
um do you think it's a presidential play
because if it is it's a pretty good one
i mean you know in terms of
finding some kind of middle that she
could peel off a few republican votes
maybe i don't know doesn't look like a
terrible idea i don't know if it'll work
but it's also possible let me give her
credit it's also possible it's just her
opinion
so it's a she's just telling you your
honest opinion
which would be awesome
now i have an opinion about stacey
abrams
that i want to see if anybody else has
this
she creeps me out
which has nothing to do with her
capability
it's not because she's a woman it's not
because it's not racial it's not it's
not any of that right
there's just something about their smile
maybe
i think it's their smile something
there's something yeah it's just off
it's like there's a uncanny valley sort
of thing there
and
i don't know i just wondered how many if
anybody else saw it
because i wouldn't say that about
too many other people
it's a weird thing
some of you know that i have a nemesis
named jen
on twitter
and his tweets are always
tagged by twitter automatically as being
affiliated with state-run media
meaning
a chinese agent i mean that's that's how
your brain should interpret it now
i should say that chen says there's no
truth to this
that he is
although he is associated with a
chinese state-affiliated media property
that his opinions are his own
so you can
you can judge for yourself
uh
but uh so he's my nemesis he tweets
things and we we disagree on twitter a
lot
but he's also super talented
you know if you ever get to have a
nemesis
you want one as good as him he's really
good at it like really good at
trolling the american opinion and
you know saying me too you know
have you considered this context america
is not so great and even though i hate
it
because i hate it when he's you know
ragging on america just sort of
naturally have a opposition to it
the things he says are actually oh
that's actually a pretty good point
it's actually useful
but he's pointing this out
in a tweet he said twitter's
discriminary discriminatory policy laid
bare here since the u.s government
propaganda voice of america doesn't even
receive such abuse he's talking about
himself being labeled as state-run media
and he says elon musk must act to remove
such mccarthyist censorship
you can see why i love him
he's such a good nemesis
but he's also right
which is
twitter is not just an american company
right it's an international property
and if twitter is going to
label
one country's people and affiliated
people as propaganda
what would be the argument for not
labeling voice of america as
propaganda
if it is propaganda
because that's why we make it right i
don't think we even pretend it's not
propaganda
am i wrong voice of america is
explicitly publicly a propaganda
entity is it not
am i overstating that i don't think i am
i feel like it's designed overtly for
that purpose and we use it and we're
happy with it
so why wouldn't twitter label it
i mean it's not even we're not even
hiding it
so and just in the way that chen
doesn't hide that he's affiliated with
state uh the china state affiliated
company he's just not making a big deal
about it so twitter does
but
maybe voice of america should be labeled
but here's the problem
well first of all i'm not making a real
practical point i doubt it'll ever be
labeled and i wouldn't care either way
but you wouldn't be able to do that
because
then everything looks like propaganda
because it is
so you'd end up labeling msnbc is
propaganda and then the whole thing just
falls apart
so
twitter has an impossible uh
and a possible task of labeling
propaganda now twitter doesn't call it
propaganda they just tell you it's
somebody associated with a
state-affiliated media
you're supposed to interpret it as
they're trying to sell you a story but
everybody is like everybody's selling us
a narrative
so
either label everybody or label nobody
because i'm not entirely sure it matters
that he's a spy does it
it matters if he's right
but usually you can check
so everybody else on twitter is just
saying stuff that often you know they
can't support
outright lies
i mean it's the nature of the the beast
but only the chinese troll alleged troll
but only the alleged chinese troll is
gets labeled and everybody else can just
spew about everything all the
time
it's a perfectly interesting question
it's either all propaganda or none of it
i don't know why you'd label some of it
all right
this ladies and gentlemen
is the conclusion of the live stream
uh have i offended any of you today
did anybody get angry at any of my
opinions
today um
oh good got a few yes
i'm over the target
oh i hate that thing
i can't believe that came out of my
mouth
do you ever say something that's such a
cliche
that you you want to slap yourself in
the face like give me a minute
there okay i i just deserve that
the the things i never want to say
are
uh it's talk around the water cooler
oh i so hate that
uh and uh and he must be over the target
because he's taking a lot of heat
like i get it's a good analogy and stuff
but it's just a little too but too used
to touch base and to piggyback on that
yeah we should um
by the way if you have any of those uh
like jargon lists that people say in in
meetings all the time uh send those to
me because i'm creating
that's gonna be part of the dave
character in in the comic strip dilbert
so dave is a african-american
character
whose
defining characteristic is you can't
tell when he's kidding
because
he uses the buzzwords that people do but
he uses them
so much
that's not entirely sure
if he's kidding so much so
that he even though he was hired by the
boss because the boss wanted more
diversity he wanted to get credit for
more diversity but dave came in and
told them that he was identifying as
white
which ruined everything
so dave
dave the new character
would just be the guy you can't tell if
he's joking or not
and i think i could just do those jokes
all day long
yeah so if you just sat in the meeting
says well we're circling back with the
synergy uh the teamwork is operating at
uh
at uh you know full scale
