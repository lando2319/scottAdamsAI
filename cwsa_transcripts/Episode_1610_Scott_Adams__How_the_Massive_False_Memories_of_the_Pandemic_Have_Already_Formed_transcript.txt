good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that happened to you in
2022
so far and that's only because i haven't
done any additional live streams
each time i do one that will be the new
highlight of your year
uh audio looks good i've been hearing
some low audio complaints about youtube
i gave it a little boost today see if it
makes a difference
and how would you like to
kick up uh the new year into the best
possible situation you could ever have
oh you do and all you need to do that is
a couple of mug or a glass of tanker
jealous time to canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
and fill it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope being
here the day the thing that makes
everyone feel better it's better than a
vaccination boost it's better than the
omicron it's better than inflation it's
called the simultaneous sip and watch it
do its business go
i just realized how i should advertise
because you know to do an advertisement
that's like dropped into the middle of
the content but i realized when i lifted
my cup up
this could be the reveal
that would be like the sponsor of the
show
and that's the only time i'd show it
it'd be like
you'd be like oh
ford
anyway
speaking of ford
uh one of the
ford executives locally
uh gave some advice on twitter yesterday
and he said that if you're
if your dealer
sells you a car or orders a car for you
but doesn't lock down the price
at the time that you order it
then you should cancel your order and
you know you're dealing with a bad
dealership
uh
i am in exactly that situation so i
tweeted back should i cancel my mustang
order because the livermore ford
dealership told me i can't negotiate the
price until the car is on the lot
which i always suspected was just a way
for them to get an extra car on the lot
and then they wouldn't care if i bought
it or somebody else because they could
sell 100 of that model it's just hard to
get one
so they just did the paperwork
pretended they ordered a car for me i
think i think that's what happened yeah
i mean there's a real order
but the car is not really really for me
it would only be for me i think
if i if i paid the non-negotiated
sticker price
because that's the estimate they gave me
but they said oh yeah we negotiate when
it gets here
well how much negotiating are they going
to do when it gets here and everybody
who walks in would buy that car because
it would be a popular model that's hard
to get
so uh so i tweeted back you know should
i cancel my
uh mustang order with livermore ford now
keep in mind i'm talking to a ford
executive
in public
and the ford executive said
yes
you should you should cancel your order
and i'll help you find a better
dealership
i thought that was that was the most
baller answer i've ever seen from an
executive yeah you should cancel your
order and i'll find you somebody who
isn't a crook basically basically that's
what he said i mean those are my own
words
and
i thought to myself you know i was
getting ready to be pretty mad at ford
but that is so transparent
first of all the executive said watch
out for this trick
and then when i said your own company is
doing that trick to me right now
your company is doing it to me right now
but you know the dealers
operate somewhat independently
and as soon as he heard it he said yeah
cancel that order i'll help you find an
honest dealership within my own company
that is a very baller answer and i give
them credit for that
all right
well we're learning today that omicron
is like beyond dangerous in terms but a
doctor i just saw a doctor on cnn's
website
saying that you could transmit uh
omicron just by taking your mask down
for a moment to say something
that's it
whereas we used to think you know six
feet a distance would protect you pretty
well
basically it sounds like if if one dude
with omicron walks through your party
it's gonna be it's gonna be a bad week
for the the people who went to that
party
now yeah right i'm not saying it's bad
or is it because here's the problem
if you get too many people who have to
quarantine at the same time the economy
is going to get really slow
really fast
but
you know what's really different
different about this one
i feel like
i think i feel like
it's entirely possible that we'll have
an organic two-week shutdown
of the economy
now maybe not the most critical things
but i can easily imagine
that
businesses just won't have enough
employees and so it won't have anything
to do with a mandate
businesses will just say uh
you know three quarters of our employees
have infections
and they have to stay home
so
there's no mandate but we can't stay
open we just can't serve people at this
level of staffing
so you might have something like a
two-week voluntary shutdown of a lot of
places
not voluntary because they wouldn't have
the staff
but the omicron passes through so
quickly
that two weeks might get us to herd
immunity
now i don't want to be the one believe
me i don't want to be the one who says
two weeks to flatten the curve
but we might have two weeks to flatten
the curve like this time it might be
real and only because of the rapidity of
the spread of omicron plus being
you know low danger
relatively
all right um i am often criticized for
talking too much about the pandemic and
that is a correct criticism however i
give you this
uh this one clarification
when i'm talking about the pandemic i'm
usually talking about
the mental part like how do we make
decisions and why do we have different
decisions and why do you see one thing
and why don't i see something else and
there are some
amazing false memories that are being
generated right now
about
what has already happened
so when historians go to write the story
of the pandemic
which of these two movies are they going
to write
are they going to write this movie that
says
the vaccinations came out
originally the data made it look like it
was a pretty good deal
it was looked like it was stopping
transmission as well as keeping people
healthier
both of those things
and for the alpha version of the virus
it looked like it was effective but as
delta came in and
you know it was sort of a
sort of broke the mold and as we found
out that the vaccinations themselves
unfortunately somewhat rapidly declined
in efficacy
the very things that were working before
stopped working so the vaccinations that
did have initially good data very good
data
very quickly turned to negative data
because of delta and because of a fall
off of efficacy now that's one of the
movies
don't don't hear that i said that's the
true one
okay
because today i'm going to talk about
what i've seen or what what i think is
true
and what other people remember to be
true
but i thought it would be
unproductive
to tell you which one is true
because all you would do is argue that
mine was the false one
and i would say no no somebody else is
the false one and we wouldn't be able to
settle that but here's what i want to do
instead
i want to show you how the two movies
formed
so it won't be a question of who's right
because i don't think we can settle it
but it will be
like a fascinating tour i hope
of how such a thing could happen
now here's the first false memory and
i'm dealing with this every day
it's a false memory of what i have
predicted or said
versus what the reality is
and
you probably some of you know i'm
there's a massive bunch of
hallucinations
about what i have said
all of it false now i can say that for
sure because in this one case i know my
own opinion
and i know what i've said
so i can tell that they're hallucinating
or or they have a false idea completely
false often opposite
of what i think now here's how that got
formed all right so here's the first
the first
clue about how illusions get formed
if i talk about a lot of stuff
about the pandemic and somebody dips in
and finds a little bit of my content
it would be as if they were looking
through one window of a house
and that's all they knew about the house
so online you hear lots of people who
say i looked into that scott adams's
house
metaphorically the pandemic conversation
and i looked through that one window and
uh his whole house is a bathroom
and then i'll say
that's not true
and they'll say yes it is i heard it
myself
i saw it myself i looked in your damn
house
through one window
and there was the bathroom there's
nothing else to say here that's what i
saw
then somebody else will say the opposite
because they were looking and they saw
the living room or some other room
so
a huge amount of the
hallucinations and they literally are
hallucinations like actual
hallucinations about my opinions are
because somebody saw a part of it now
here's the weirdest part
some people are saying that
yeah yeah yeah scott you may have
you may have mentioned all of the topics
but you you kind of focus on
one thing and you don't let's say you
focus on the vaccines
uh whether they work and you don't talk
about say the
the cost of the shutdown
would you say that's true
that i have underestimated or let's say
under emphasized
whenever i talk about the topic
have i
under emphasized
the social cost
of shutting down
on locals i'm seeing a mix some yeses
and some knows
yes yes yes so a lot of people would say
that's true i've underestimated or under
emphasized not estimated i've under
emphasized
the cost of the social shutdowns and the
mandates
now here's my defense to that
you ready
for those of you who think i've
underemphasized that here's my defense
why would i have to tell you any of that
we're all on the same page
literally all of us are living those
costs
it's obvious
do i have to tell you that teens don't
like zoom school
but
you didn't know that until i told you or
did you imagine
that everybody knew it but me
did you imagine that it was obvious to
everyone
but because i didn't emphasize it as
much as you think that i was the one who
didn't know that zoom school was bad for
kids
did you think that
because if i think that you know it and
obviously you know i know it i'm not
going to talk about it a lot because
what would you say about it i can't
estimate it i don't know how big the
damage is
i've talked about you know the suicides
etc
but
um
all right
so so there's some obvious reasons why
people have false memories of me now
here's the interesting part
if
if either my memory of events or my
critics memory of the pandemic events is
correct
one of us would be triggered into
cognitive dissonance
and here i'm not going to tell you which
one it is
i'll just tell you look for the trigger
of whoever's wrong but here's the hard
part
my critics think that i have been proven
unambiguously wrong
and the data shows it now clearly
and the anybody can look at it you can
just google it you can see what i said
you can see what's true and you can see
i'm wrong
and then i asked for examples
and the examples almost entirely are
things i didn't say
or just crazy stuff or people
misinterpret the question answer the
wrong question etc
so
so that's going on too but we don't know
who has the cognitive dissonance but
here's i boiled it down to one specific
question
to see if i could give some insight in
this
and the question was was it ever true
that
vaccinations stopped the transmission or
spread of the virus
all right this seems to be one of the
biggest issues that people have with me
is that they say that i believed or were
sad based on my belief
that the vaccinations at one point early
on
stopped the
would stop the spread
now when somebody says stop the spread
how do you interpret that if somebody
said i think this vaccination
will
stop the spread
would you interpret that as every single
person who's vaccinated could not
get the virus and or spread it
would you ever interpret
this will give you immunity as a hundred
percent
does any anybody just automatically say
well that means everybody
because
you should never do that so here's
another reason that the movie's diverged
a lot of people hear
this will give you immunity
this will work really well this will
stop the spread and what they hear is
this will 100 percent be effective
and then they look at the data and it's
not 100 effective
right it's not 100 effective so they say
well this was a lie
you told us it would be effective and
now it's not 100 effective so that's a
lie whereas other people like me would
say
you should assume that they didn't mean
a hundred percent
no it's way less than 100 so that's you
know a big problem
but
um
joe blow is saying that they literally
said 100
so i saw a video compilation
as part of this research here
if you could call it that on twitter and
people sent me a video compilation of
people
saying
it would 100 percent stop
and i watched the compilation
of all the experts fauci and the cdc
saying that there would be a hundred
percent stopping of the
virus right how many of you saw that
how many of you saw the compilation
video
of the experts actually saying
something we know not to be true which
is a 100 it's going to stop the virus
i'm looking at the comments so a lot of
people saw it
i saw it this morning
it doesn't exist
i saw it this morning
and it doesn't exist
so all of you who saw it
no you didn't
i saw it too and there's nothing on
there that would suggest a hundred
percent
it is your interpretation of what they
meant
my interpretation as a writer because i
i write myself into this trap all the
time
if you're a writer writer you are
continuously dealing
with people hearing absolutes in your
writing
when you didn't mean an absolute and the
way that you didn't mean it is nobody
should think this was an absolute
suppose i say uh
guns stop a crime
private gun ownership
stops crime
would you interpret that as it stops all
crime
would that be your natural
interpretation oh you're saying guns
stop all crime
would you interpret it that way
that would be a silly interpretation
right but with vaccines we do i don't
know maybe because it's medical
our brains
kind of we're hearing hundred percents
where nobody ever talks like that
see what i just did
that was accidental i just said nobody
ever talks like that
so i gave you an absolute
and you should have
understood it could never be an absolute
right so the very trap that i said
people easily fall into because it's
just easier to talk in absolutes we all
do it
so the very thing that you saw with your
own eyes as them saying it's a hundred
percent i watched with my own eyes just
minutes ago
i didn't see it
i saw people talking the way people talk
they talk in absolutes but you as the
audience should of course understand
they don't mean absolutes
of course not
straw man gaslight so some of you are
going to have some difficulty with this
topic there will be some squirming
all right um
then i asked this question to see if i
could get a
percentage well actually let me give you
a little test
suppose
the vaccines came out
and and here's the only thing you knew
about the pharma industry this isn't
true
but suppose just as a mental exercise
suppose you knew
that a hundred percent of the fda
approved
medicines that came out of big pharma
worked
in the past different ones i'm not
talking about vaccines but every kind of
medicine the fda had approved suppose
you knew and again this is not true i'm
just saying suppose you do that they all
worked
every one of them for decades and
decades they all worked
meaning that they worked
better than the
cost of the side effects
now
let's say in that context
big pharma comes up with some new
vaccinations
every single thing they've ever done has
worked
what would you think
is the likelihood that the new
vaccinations would work
even given
that they didn't have enough time to do
a long-term study
what would be your natural guess
as to whether it's likely that they
worked
pretty high right if everything had
worked before
even if they had a compressed schedule
for testing which they did with the
vaccines you think well yeah this is
more risky
because they don't have the long-term
effects
but if you look at their track record
it's a hundred percent
so
it's a good bet right now say it was the
opposite let's go extreme opposite
suppose you knew that a hundred percent
of every kind of pharmaceutical drug
that had ever been created and approved
by the fda
was later found to be ineffective
and then they in that context then
somebody comes up with a new drug or a
new vaccine
what would be your reasonable
prediction about whether the new one
would work if a hundred percent of the
old ones didn't work
and you know you'd probably say well
you're not so good
so i asked this poll on twitter
obviously very unscientific i said what
percentage of fda approved drugs of any
kind
do you believe
work in the in terms of benefit over
risk
and i gave people ranges from 0 to 25 25
to 50 50 to 75 etc
and it turns out that your opinions
you being the public who answered this
poll
are very evenly spread
surprisingly so
so here are the the number of people who
answered my poll unscientifically who
thought that the total number of fda
approved drugs that have ever worked
is below 25 percent
of all the fda approved drugs
a quarter of the people who answered
a quarter of the people
think that fewer than a quarter of the
drugs have ever worked
are they wrong
how would i know
how would you know
all right how many people thought that
between 25 and 50
of those drugs never worked
like as high as half
of all the drugs
so 28
said uh
um
that between 25 and 50 of the drugs have
ever worked
and then so that's about even right
24 28. and then the number of think it's
between 50 and 75 is about 31
and only 18 this is the smallest number
think that the drugs work between 75 and
100 of the time
now this explains our two movies
because would you have a different
opinion of how likely
big pharma lied
if they were only right 25 of the time
or less but if you thought they were
right
75 percent of the time or more
okay damn it that's too good
damn it
i just got linguistically kill shotted
this is so good i'm going to tell i'll
regret this forever but the craig 777
just gave me a nickname
claw adams
damn you that's good
that is so good
now of course it's based on a
hallucination right
the hallucination is that you believe i
was
pushing vaccines now none of that
happened in my movie but in your movie
where that stuff happened that is a
really good nickname
i got to give you credit for that it
will probably ruin my whole career it's
not good
and i mean that i mean that that that
nickname could actually ruin my whole
rest of my reputation in life and none
of them would be basically anything true
that's how powerful a good nickname is
but damn that's good
damn i have to appreciate the technique
uh even if i don't like the outcome all
right
so
here's the uh so if you've got different
assumptions about how bad big pharma has
been in the past how can you possibly
end up with the same assumption about
whether the vaccines work so here's the
other reason that we've got two movies
on one screen
if you believe that big pharma almost
always sells you fake drugs
you would assume that this next one was
fake and that they were lying about it
but lying about it working
or even lying about them being concerned
it worked
but if you thought that they were right
75 out of 100 times
you'd probably think you know
probably got this one too
so it's not so much that any of you are
dumb or smart you're starting with
different assumptions
and how would you ever know
which of these assumptions is correct
i mean these are wildly different to
imagine that the past drugs that have
ever been approved
that
75 percent or more of them worked versus
only
less than 25
those are completely different worlds
so
let's see
uh i'm just
i'm trying to resist blocking a user
here who's like right on the edge you're
right on the edge
um
and i i'm i'm just like barely
containing a string of profanities that
are about to come out of my mouth but
i'm gonna do my best
so
so those are some reasons for the false
memories but i got i had some exchanges
with some people online who have a
completely different memory
of the beginning of the vaccination
phase
and i thought to myself how can we have
completely different memories
and how would i know if mine is the
right one so i
tested it on
twitter
and here's the the single question that
i think a lot of this turns on
my memory
of the early the early rollout is this
now remember i'm not claiming my memory
is the correct one
right and you're going to say to me
scott why don't you just google it and
i'm going to tell you why that won't
work in a minute
so my memory is the following
that when the vaccines first came out
that the early data the early data which
later changed that the early data showed
that it improved survivability but also
reduced
the spread
and then
after the delta came out and after the
and after omicron came out that was no
longer as true and maybe so untrue that
it's just completely true untrue at this
point about the transmission part still
true about the survivability according
to the data
now that was my memory my memory is that
there was data
and that when delta and omicron you know
came the the it changed and also the
efficacy dropped off and we couldn't
know that until the long term it
happened right nobody knew the long term
efficacy because you can't study the
long term in the short term
so what i saw
was people who were optimistic but wrong
optimistic but wrong but i didn't see a
lie
in terms of a direct lie
that there's a specific person who told
the lie
now that was my view of what happened
now on twitter i found out that there's
a whole bunch of other people
uh okay drew you're gonna go away
all right so so all the people on
youtube who are uh mocking me about
boosters number one
it's not funny
it's not creative like if it were clever
like claw adams at least give you some
credit for being clever
but
um
if if i can mock you with a funny face
and i don't need to do anything else
then what you're saying is probably
pretty stupid
let's test it
i'm just going to say what you said but
i'll do it with a funny mocking face
and see if you sound stupid using
exactly what you said
but with the addition of my funny
mocking face
scott what are you gonna get the the
booster you gonna get the booster you
get the booster
how about the booster
how about the booster
uh huh
has he mentioned the booster yet
are you getting your freedom booster yet
all right i i hope that maybe you could
stop saying the same dumbass comment
message received
some people got shots
and are considering the booster
it's not a
point that you're making so you're
boring us
stop doing it okay
uh
criticisms are allowed
dumb boring ones are not
all right um
so here's the question so a lot of a lot
of people said no scott you have a
complete false memory and the early data
never showed
that uh transmissions could be reduced
by vaccinations
and i said to myself
seriously
and i thought there can't be more than
one person who thinks that
because my memory was
so
so clear
that it was based on data and i thought
multiple studies etc
so i thought
do other people have the same view and
it turns out a lot of people have the
view
that the data never showed
at any point
that the vaccines worked
in any way
[Laughter]
now does that blow your mind at all if
you're in my movie because some of you
were in my movie but some of you in that
other movie does it blow your mind at
all that both of these memories are held
by the public
one that the vaccinations used to work
but things changed and the other that
the data never showed they worked
even in the beginning
that's freaky isn't it because that
would be the easiest thing in the world
to check wouldn't it
so now you're saying to yourself uh
scott
spend five seconds on duckduckgo
and find out did the data exist or did
it not
so do you think that was easy
i'll just google it
nope
turns out that's really hard
so even the search engine can't tell you
what happened
it's crazy how are the historians going
to write this story
because
you can't even research it
now here's why
i think i have the answer are you ready
for this so this is like the the key to
unlock how these two movies formed how
could i have a and many of you by the
way many many of the comments
have supported my
view of what happened
and others have not
so we know the two movies are
are verified that they both exist
here's what happened i believe and it's
kind of interesting
um and ian or martisa's had the best i
think he unlocked this for me
apparently people were using different
definitions for a lot of important stuff
here
and let me
just give you an idea how bad it was
here are the various terms that have
been used by experts as well as
pundits talking about it
does the vaccination prevent infection
or provide immunity does it boost your
immune response or does it provide
protection does it prevent serious
disease or does it vaccinate against
and apparently we don't have the same
definition of what the same idea of what
those words mean
for example
i was informed
that the definition of a vaccination has
changed how many of you have heard that
that the actual word
vaccination
suddenly magically changed to a
different definition in 2021 yeah you
all heard that right
i'm saying yes yes yes
um and so i
i saw the evidence of that
so with my own eyes
i looked at the direct evidence i read
it with my own eyes how the definition
had changed
from one thing to this brand new
definition in 2021. so i saw it with my
own eyes
and
it didn't happen
i saw it with my own eyes
it didn't happen
i mean i mean i didn't see it i looked
at what you looked at and i didn't see
it
now does that mean it didn't happen well
it happened in your movie
i'm just saying that i can't say it
um
anyway
uh
here's what happened when i asked this
so a number of people sent me uh studies
to confirm that my view was correct
so so i i've tweeted out the links if
you want to see them i've got a couple
of links that show that the um the
initial data showed it was very
effective against transmission
and then very quickly things changed and
then it wasn't
now
how can you not see it
oh um let me give you yeah let me finish
the point there
uh you said how could i not see it and
the answer is
the definition changed from
something that gives you immunity
to something that gives you protection
so there it is right
so what i read that i was directed to
read was that the definition changed for
vaccination from something that gives
you immunity
to something that gives you protection
and there it is right
i don't see it
now you're all saying i just read it
there it is
no i don't see it
let me read it again because i don't see
it
the definition changed from immunity to
protection
to words that mean about the same thing
to me
so i see two words that mean the same
thing
which means that the definition didn't
change they use different words
but i see the same
thing
now
i believe this gets back to the hundred
percent thing
if somebody said
a vaccine gives you immunity
what's that mean to you
what would it mean if somebody says it
gives you immunity
to me it sounds like protection
yeah they changed the word
but
what does immunity mean to you
do when you see immunity do you think
100 of people won't get it or 100 of
people won't get sick
some uh here it is there it is okay so
there's somebody answered in on locals
somebody said directly the word immunity
implies a hundred percent
how many of you would agree with that
that the word immunity
implies a hundred percent
nothing's getting in yeah okay so that's
why you looked right at it and you can
see it
because when you read the word immunity
you read a hundred percent when you read
the word protection you're like oh
that does not mean 100 right
right
immunity means 100
but protection obviously doesn't mean
100
so that's what all of you saw
now
i am a writer
by trade
and my interpretation of the words
are that it means the same thing
that's my interpretation
because if you said to me scott this
will give you immunity i would never
think a hundred percent
in a medical in a medical context
when do you ever think a hundred percent
except maybe
if somebody's dead they're not coming
back well i suppose depends how long
they've been dead
but in the medical world what is 100
anything
is there ever anything ever been 100
so if you're in the medical context
and somebody says something gives you
immunity why would you ever think that
mental hundred percent
why would you assume that
now my guess is that the reason they
changed it is because people
misinterpreted the word immunity
that looks like the obvious reason
if i thought that people were
misinterpreting immunity to mean 100
percent
because remember even the best initial
data didn't say 100 percent
does everybody agree with that
that even the initial data
that all the experts were referring to
it never said 100 it was always 97.95
this sort of thing right
so
so let me let me ask you again
knowing just hearing my explanation
if you ever interpreted immunity as a
hundred percent
does it make sense now that other people
didn't
okay can you see can you see why other
people
would interpret immunity within the
medical context to mean
yeah it works pretty good
for
some people it might be immunity
some people might kill
right now
so i think mostly there's a definitional
problem here
um and uh it's really hard to suss out
which of the experts said something that
really looked like a lie
and which which of them said something
that was
at one time true and then new data come
out and it was different
and
uh when they're just talking sloppy
they're using words that mean something
a little different to you
so i think that a lot of the people who
think that um that we clearly were lied
to
have the following um
illusions
all right
so this would be be supporting
the the theory that my world view is
correct
which doesn't mean it is
it would just be a theory that would
explain why one would be true you can't
prove it so the other worldview
could be true if i'm misreading
everything
so if i'm misreading everything which
can happen right that's what cognitive
dissonance is i could absolutely be
misremembering and misreading everything
and by the way my critics are saying and
a lot of them and a lot of them right
here are saying i'm doing exactly that
that i'm actually misreading
basically everything
and not just one thing just just
everything
so here here's what causes the two
movies number one if you assumed that
the pharma companies are almost always
lying
and almost always giving you fake drugs
that don't work
you would assume quite reasonably
that this was probably another one of
those situations
if you believe that they
probably usually make jugs at work
but not all the time you might be in the
other movie
if you think that these definitions are
different
if you think that immunity meant a
hundred percent
which i would say would be a
uh
i don't want to
i don't want to use a word that sounds
like i'm insulting you let's say
uh i was
i can't think of a word that doesn't
sound insulting because i don't don't
mean this to be an insult it's just an
interpretation thing
if you thought immunity meant a hundred
percent
um
you may not have the
maybe the writer's experience
that people often misinterpret your
statements as as absolutes
so if you have that continuing problem
like i do of always being yeah i did it
again
see what i did i just said i'm always
being
misinterpreted
should you and you should you have
interpreted that statement i'm always
being misinterpreted to mean every
single person misinterprets me every
time of course not
you would use the context
of course it doesn't mean that
um
or here's a comment uh both things are
true many facts are unchanged many
interpret them being fed by media yeah
so it's it's a soup of people being
wrong people interpreting words
differently
people not knowing that the data changed
but i can i can send you the links that
say that the vaccines did
stop everything early but then they
became less effective over time so if
you don't believe that ever happened i
can show you the links
all right see what else we've got going
on here
and also there's a question of
whether the vaccine is like
stopping the the virus from getting a
hold
or is it just building up your natural
immunity so it does it always gets a
hole but it doesn't you know
take root or something
to use common language
so
uh as long as we're disagreeing on all
these things
we'll see two movies forever
and as ian said
martis if we don't agree on what words
mean like at the very beginning if we
don't have common definitions then uh
one can later claim any history of what
they said
and that's exactly what's happening so
because we don't agree on the
assumptions of how likely a pharma
company will lie to you in any given
situation we don't agree what any of the
words meant
and we have apparently some number of us
have completely false memories
maybe me
right i can't rule that out it might be
me
but maybe you
complete false memories of whether the
vaccines ever worked
so
um there's absolutely nothing else
interesting happening
so
how many of you um just heard this and
it sounded to you like i was promoting
vaccinations
how many would interpret this morning's
live stream
as promoting vaccinations
thankfully mostly knows right no
and
um
have i given you my updated opinion on
getting a booster myself
don't think i have
because it you know this is sort of
subject to to change but i'll wait as
long as possible i think there's the
extra risk
that you know that level of boosty
boostiness
can't be tested
so it's sort of even more of a guess
than the other guesses
at the moment i'm leaning toward uh
waiting it out
and getting some of that sweet sweet
omicron in my system instead
so that's where i'm leaning if i had to
you know suddenly travel and it was a
mandate
i don't know i might make a practical
decision
but
you want a real mind teaser i'm going to
leave you with the final mind teaser
suppose you were trying to decide
whether to get vaccinated and you wanted
to you wanted as much information as
possible
and let's say you knew
which you can't know
let's say you knew the history of how
accurate the vaccine
all medications from big pharma had been
in the past
and let's say you knew
you don't
but let's say you did
you knew that
fewer than 25 of the time
the drugs even work
would it be rational
to take the vaccination with all the
other stuff that we know that you may or
may not trust but would it be rational
if you knew
that fewer than a quarter of the people
fewer than a quarter of any medication
that ever went in the market ever worked
the answer is you can't tell
do you know why
because none of the risks can be
measured
you can't measure the risk
of
side effects
in the long term
you can't
so if i told you that there's some
chance that the vaccination works
you might make a calculation closer to
your ivermectin calculation
because i've told you before that i
predict ivermectin will be shown not to
be terribly effective maybe a little
but i think it will not be shown to be
as effective as his proponents show
at the same time that i predict it
doesn't work
i would give the odds of it working at
less than 25 percent
but would i take it
if i got coveted
yes i would assuming my doctor said yes
right i would take it
now why would that be different from the
vaccinations
now one way it could be different is you
say well uh scott the ivermectin is so
well known
we don't have downside
but we also don't know anything about
long covet
so since all of the
all of the risks are completely
unsizable
even if you knew that big pharma had a
low track record of success
it could still be
ivermectin-ish in terms of your cost
benefit
if you thought that the risk was
gigantic
of getting covered and you thought that
the risk of the vaccine killing you
itself
was relatively small you would still
take a 25 chance that it made a
difference
i mean or or let me say it better you
would never have the numbers to know if
you were making the right decision
we wouldn't have the right data for that
but it wouldn't be irrational
to get a shot if you knew that
medicine in general only worked 25 of
the time it wouldn't be rational it
could be wrong but it wouldn't be
irrational
because all the decisions ultimately are
irrational in the sense that we don't
have enough data
yeah you know those who assume the
government is guilty and assume that big
pharma is guilty
you kind of have to know how often that
assumption works
thank you a.a
scott is right about this
yeah as soon as you compare diver meknes
starts making sense
um
but you have to be careful because
xeifermectin has a much safer long-term
well actually let me ask you this do you
think ivermectin's ever been
studied
in a way that can guarantee you it's
safe
can anything because there's no
absolutes right
there are no absolutes
um
we have quite a few short-term trials
yeah we have lots of uh lower quality
data at least
you know my old philosophy teacher used
to say
that the food in the cafeteria was bad
but at least there's a lot of it
so that's that's our data
well our all of our data
about the pandemic is bad
but we got a lot of it
so that's the good news it's all bad but
hey
thank goodness there's not a shortage of
it
nothing is absolute damn it jordan
stop it with your mind games nothing is
absolute
all right
um scott how many boosters would you be
willing to go up to
i still wanna
i
i just feel like
answering that question is a uh
is a dead end
because why would it matter to you how
many boosters that i thought i would get
and first of all why would you think i
could answer that question
what would make you think i could answer
that question
how could anybody answer that question
how many boosters now i have told you
that i'm
you know i'm undecided between zero and
one booster
but that i'm leaning heavily towards
zero
why would you ask me how many i would
get
wouldn't that depend on what i learned
between now and there and then
so if i don't learn anything new
i would certainly well there will be
something new because we'll know what
happens with omicron
so the the booster question is undecided
wait as long as possible and i haven't
waited long enough yet
so stop asking me if i'm going to get
boosted
if you've made a decision about it you
you need to defend your decision
i say there's insufficient data
but there might be better data later
don't know
but there might be even if the better
data is only in the form of knowing more
about the alternative which is getting
infected by omicron
all right have you seen dr malone so
here's my problem with
dr malone on joe rogan
and unfortunately i'm trying to avoid
the same problem that my critics have
with me
which is as they see a little bit of my
opinion and then form
a total opinion based on you know
looking at that one pinprick
and i don't want to do that with dr
malone because i think i've been guilty
of
that same sin myself
and i'm not going to watch a three-hour
anything even even that was sped up
so i will never be able to penetrate
what dr malone said
and i just want to tell you i'm not
going to put in the work
because i'm just not going to do that
much homework to listen to what one guy
said so let me say it this way
if there is a statement he said
you know a
just a clean
statement
of opinion or fact
i'd love to hear it
if you think that that's
that's like the important thing
somebody says it's a cop-out
i think the weakest comment on the
internet is that somebody else didn't do
enough research because that assumes
that if you did more research it would
make a difference and all evidence
suggests that's not the case we we just
get more confirmation bias
but
no i am definitely lazy about things
that don't make a difference
i try to be not lazy about things that
do make a difference
somebody says just watch the last half
hour you're you're so close
but but let me test it
i know a number of you have seen it by
now
state in the comments one just one
sentence could be two it just says
something he said
that you think would be different from
what i believe go let's test it for
those of you seen it
give me one example of something he said
and if i miss it just repeat it please
because there's too many things wrong
um
all right look so here's the here's the
kind of comments so norman says scott
knows if he listens to malone he'll not
be able to hide the cognitive dissonance
now that's the mind reader
problem right there right here's what i
think would happen if i listen to dr
malone
i think i would agree with him
unless there's a difference in data
interpretation in which case i would
look to others to say if his data was
right or not
do you think i would disagree with him
what would i disagree about
balloon talked about hypnosis
but what do you think i would disagree
with him about
right nothing so you're all shooting
empties
there's the
um
mass formation
psychosis i wouldn't disagree with him
about that that's just one window on
this
that's somewhat incomplete
but all the things that form mass
the mass hypnosis
formation thing those those things do
exist and they do matter but give me
consent no i'm not going to disagree
about that
you're shooting blanks yeah not empties
you disagree about him saying deaths are
over accounting
no i don't think i disagree
so if you can come up with any reason
that you think i would disagree with him
tell me what that disagreement is
and if there's a place on the video to
see the context i'll listen to it but
if you can't tell me anything that he
says that i don't say
why are you recommending that i listen
to him
i need to watch it just to say i'm
posting alone
good one
he talks about deep knowledge of
corruption in the medical industry
does anybody think that i'm not aware of
deep
corruption in the medical industry
does anybody think i would need to find
that out for the first time
so
as far as somebody says i'm being obtuse
andrew
it's a very easy test tell me something
he said
that you believe i would disagree with
is that is that an unreasonable thing if
i'm being asked to consume three hours
of content
even sped up it might be two hours
if i'm being asked to do a whole bunch
of homework don't you think that's fair
for me to say name one thing he says
that i might disagree with
um
somebody says this is boring no matter
what we give you you'll just say you
agree with it well that's the point
my understanding is that dr malone is
well informed
if i'm also well informed would we just
agree
i i see no reason
what early treatment what am i going to
disagree about that all right
so
let me ask you this
have i made my case
that you can see the the causes of the
two movies
did i make that case
i'm seeing uh yeses
mostly yeses now the question of who's
right or wrong i'll i'll leave that to
you
i'll leave that to you
um do you think the next pandemic will
be handled better
i do
i do i mean i would be really surprised
if this pandemic doesn't
get us in much better shape
uh
you said deaths are undercounted
yes i said that
but also over counted
so
i
so here's here's the thing
hospitals
were some people say
hospitals were incentivized
to say that somebody died of covid you
know even if maybe it was just with
covet so everybody's on the same page
with that right
and that would be an example of what
over counting
right so if you ever heard me disagree
with the notion
that some people are accounted as
covades
when probably they just had something
else going on and they died have i ever
disagreed with that right so in that
limited context that would be an obvious
case
where you should assume there's over
counting everybody on the same page
now here's
the other part of the equation
when people die at home
who determines what they died of
and it turns out more people than you
think die at home
so the people who died at home
may have died at covid but if they were
let's say they're 98 years old and had a
co-morbidity
if your 98 year old grandmother dies
and you knew she had a bad ticker
what are you gonna do uh are you gonna
do a covet test
no no
so
the thought was in india of course this
would be on a much bigger effect but the
thought is there are people who are
dying
that because they didn't go through the
hospital system they died at home for
example that they wouldn't be counted
so i think that it's true that there's
both over counting and under counting
would anybody disagree with that
that in one way there's almost certainly
over counting
but on in another sense in another
element of it there would be almost
certainly undercounting
now
now my my estimate has always been
that let's say we get to what are we up
to deaths in the united states 800 000
something like that give it give me the
current number
so my take is that if the 800 000 or so
deaths
was
600 000 or maybe it was 1.2 million
that we would have acted about the same
so i'm not sure it matters and i would i
would imagine that you would find
hospitals that have over counted and
hospitals that have under counted
don't you think i mean it's a big world
and you also have the different uh
standards for determining if somebody
has covet i can't i can't believe
everybody used even the same standard
so i would say probably some places or
under some places or over if he asks me
if i know what the net is
i don't
i don't
but
i don't know that it would have changed
anything
uh yeah in rural india there are plenty
of deaths that don't get counted so they
might have more deaths that's correct
all right um
um that's worth listening to
all right
is this a positive discussion
yeah i think it's a positive discussion
only in the sense
of how to make decisions and what to
believe
yeah i'm i'm much less interested in the
actual
you know the medical what you do
than how we process these things and how
is it we have completely false memories
of things that just happen basically
anyway
um
tomorrow will be a lot better than today
because we'll have some actual news by
then today's gonna be a slow news day
and uh
let's uh let's go forth and have some
fun
if you didn't see my special
live stream yesterday that i did after
my normal live stream
uh you don't want to miss that one
that one's the weird one
weird weird good so watch that one
please
and
thank you so some people liked that
video yesterday
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
