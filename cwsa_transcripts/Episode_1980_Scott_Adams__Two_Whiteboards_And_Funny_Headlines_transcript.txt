stable for
half a minute
it's funny that we that live stream
technology is still not the stable
technology
basically
all right looks like it's gonna work
a little bit a little bit
I hope we see all the the clot Birds
um Erica the excellent had a uh a poll
on Twitter
in which people were asked
um what should we name the fans who come
over and the yellow clot clot
and there were several uh possibilities
let's see what were the possibilities we
had a
clitius
clunt
Scott's Scotties Pilates
and clubbers
clubbert's one with 34 of the vote uh
close second was Clems
uh then third was Scott's Scotty's
claudis and then clydie it's worth only
11 so we're going with clubbert's
so welcome to all the club Birds your
fan activity is appreciated
and uh
if you'd like to
if you'd like to show yourself just use
your catchphrase
the catchphalt the catchphrase is cope
cope
so you want to say that as much as
possible during the live stream
but also identify yourself I want to see
how big my fan base is of the clap Birds
well uh Kevin McCarthy uh
had a bad week I don't know did is
anybody paying attention to the Speaker
of the House situation has he has he
been uh denied a 12th time yet I think
he's been he's lost 11 in a row
but there was some news about overnight
they might have a deal
I don't think they have a deal do you
how many people think that overnight
they actually came up with a deal
I feel unlikely Maybe
oh the copers are back thank you
scream it scream it cope
all right well in addition to that uh
somebody was complaining that they
discovered and this is scandalous I
didn't know this about Kevin McCarthy
McCarthy he once admitted that he's
actually confessed this
so you don't have to wonder about it
he's confessed
he had an actual meal I believe it was a
dinner
with that world economic Forum founder
Klaus Schwab back in 2018. yeah they
actually ate a meal together
now every now and then I like to take a
news story to remind the public
that I assert my
absolute right of Association
that you will never you will never
embarrass me you'll never shame me
because you found out I ate a meal with
somebody you don't like
now what do people say when I say that
what's the most obvious thing that
people say they say oh yes anybody oh oh
you would associate with everybody so
would you associate with
a serial killer
yeah
are you kidding
you you wouldn't have dinner with a
serial killer if you had a chance
you know well you're pretty boring I
would take that dinner in a heartbeat
how about uh whoever is the current head
of the KKK
absolutely I wouldn't want to be seen no
obviously I might not want to be seen
but how interesting would that be
are you kidding me
that would be the most interesting
dinner you ever had
how about the head of black lives matter
how about that yes yes totally are you
kidding me how about uh the most radical
people in antifa would I would I be seen
having a meal with them
yes yes absolutely
I can't imagine how much fun that would
be
so yeah Obama absolutely Hitler yes
yes this is the one time when you can't
Hitler me you can't hear me on this
because usually you can go but how about
Hitler
yes
yes
I'm not Ben Garrison though okay damn it
okay I wouldn't be seen with any of Ben
Garrison that's true
well now you just ruined my whole thing
I was sure there was nobody that I
wouldn't be embarrassed but I'd be
embarrassed
with idiot Ben Garrison so okay you got
me
pull apart no problem Putin yes uh
Stalin absolutely Ben Garrison
all right let's talk about chat GPT the
uh AI That's making a lot of news
so it was Sam Altman one of the founders
apparently uh he's talking to somebody
about accepting some investment
that would value the company at 29
billion dollars I
it's a startup
this startup that hasn't produced as far
as I know is produced no Revenue
as far as I know might maybe there's
some
and as being valued by investors at 29
billion dollars
now apparently there's some other AI
companies that are getting lots of
Interest too now let me ask you
do you do you believe that uh
that it'll be worth it
does that valuation sound too high
it doesn't
you know it's too high if some other AI
is better
that is definitely too high if it turns
out and I don't know if this is true by
the way but if it turned out that this
is the best one
and it looks like it might stay the best
one because that has some kind of
Advantage 29 billion is probably cheap
right I don't know all the ways you
could
commercialize it but it seems Unlimited
it's unlimited not only is it unlimited
but it gets to the most important things
we care about
right everything from you missed the Sip
already happened so everything we care
about like human relations it might
replace those work it's going to replace
a lot of jobs and make things easier
searching for things on the internet yes
knowing what's true versus what is BS
well it might not be good at it but
we're going to use it for that so yeah
absolutely everything that we care the
most about even Health Care
everything but AI because you know it's
by definition uh a version of our own
brains
the importance of AI it's impossible
to calculate
is is bigger than anything we've ever
done in my opinion by far and should
grow faster than anything we've ever
done
because even the internet itself as fast
as it grew you know as fast as Google
grew as fast as Apple grew
they still were creating infrastructure
as they grew right they're sort of
following the infrastructure
but the infrastructure is there now like
the internet exists technology it's
pretty Advanced you just plop this into
it and it's just
so
to me it looks like uh it's impossible
to estimate but it's going to change
everything
all right here's a valuable lesson how
can you make a supermodel unattractive
to men
like that seems hard right
if you have a super bottle like one of
the most beautiful women in the world
how could you make her unattractive
to men
now without changing her look all right
and here's here's the rule you can't
change your appearance
she has to become unattractive to all
men
without changing her look at all okay
and
um
supermodel uh what's her name Emily uh
radachowski Retta radishowski
she managed to pull it off
so there's two stories of this one story
one is the Fox News fake news so that's
some fake news on Fox News and the fake
news is the headline doesn't match the
story all right so the story is nothing
it just doesn't match the story so
here's the headline
supermodel complains she only attracts
quote emasculated men after her breakup
with Pete Davidson now if you read the
story wouldn't you expect it would be
something about
supermodel complained she's only she
only attracts a masculated men after her
breakup with Pete Davidson
again the story isn't that
there's nothing like that in the story
but the story itself is interesting it's
just not that
here's the actual story
she also said I feel like I attract the
worst men but then when she explained it
you see it's a different story entirely
she said one of her main problems with
some men uh radakowski said this was on
the Fox News site is that they quote
don't know how to handle the strong
woman
and we're out
[Laughter]
it was really that easy it was how many
words
now one two three four five six seven
eight words
eight words they don't know how to
handle a strong woman and I'm out
yeah are there any women who are
confused
all the men are laughing right the men
are going uh yep yep but already the
women confused by this
all right here's what is not here's what
is not
it's not about
men not liking strong personalities
nope
nope there's nothing about that in this
situation
this is men who know exactly what that
code means
if you hear ever hear a woman and maybe
it's the same for men but you know I'll
just talk from my experience if you ever
see a woman she has a strong personality
run
run away because that's always the cover
for you know of a raging
always
yeah so what she said was uh about the
men because she's a strong woman she I
guess she thinks that the the men need
to tear her down to you know assert
their their level compared to her that's
how I read this anyway and she said they
start to tear you down and then you're
back to square one
yeah and it's so effed up and unfair
because I feel like a lot of men who
truly think they want a strong woman
actually don't know how to handle it
yeah that's the problem
all the men who want a strong woman but
then when they get one
they don't know how to handle it
that's what's going on in this situation
yep that's absolutely what's happening
is that they're afraid of those strong
women they don't know
or
do I I don't need to finish the story
right everybody's already filled in the
entire story
can I have a quick vote
the story is done
no more explanation needed right yeah
you completed it do you mind we're done
all right
um here in this is in the category of
the simulation never disappoints us
the simulation continues to entertain
and here the simulation is provided and
not usually an unusually warm winter
both in the Northeast and I think some
parts of Europe
which means that the future prices of
natural gas
have plummeted
so natural gas that we thought was going
to be a huge shortage and too expensive
and Putin was going to freeze Europe
turns out
Europe's going to have a warm winter and
so is parts of the United States they
usually get cold
so demand is down at least anticipated
demand which affects current prices
at Future prices and
so Putin's strategy of Frieza Europe
looks like it's just not going to work
all right
how many of you
believed that Europe would figure out a
way to get through
I did
I use the Adam's law of slow moving
disasters now this one was an edge case
because it wasn't that slow moving but
we did see it a year in advance didn't
we about a year in advance people were
saying whoa whoa whoa Putin's gonna
start turning off the energy so it turns
out that maybe six months of getting
really serious about a really big
problem
was enough
once again
team human being
pulls off a miracle save
for a problem we saw coming because we
saw it coming
every time we see a coming we win
we we have like a hundred thousand you
know years of success uh maybe maybe the
early tribal people got wiped out by
their neighbors and they saw that coming
so maybe it wasn't so good in the early
days but at least since my life you know
my lifetime
when you give humans a lot of you know
Runway
and they can see the problem clearly and
they all agree what the problem is
we're insanely good at solving problems
it's just crazy how good we are now some
of it might be because the news likes to
exaggerate how bad the problem is in the
first place so it's a combination of
great competence with maybe a little
exaggeration
but here we are it looks like we pulled
it off now
uh how many of you have this prediction
I'll State the prediction and tell me
how many of you like saw this coming you
probably saw this coming right
if there's one thing that works against
Russia's military it's the weather
[Laughter]
it's the freaking weather
the weather that you know the the common
belief the common military belief about
Russia is that the only way they could
win a war is if it gets really cold
am I right
how did Russia do in Afghanistan well it
turns out it wasn't cold enough was it
but you know if you got Napoleon
attacking you
cold is going to help you out right so
so Putin's best defense like the main
thing that was protecting Russia
was the weather
now
so we have this story it's in the Wall
Street Journal right big story National
story that the weather is unusually warm
and because it's unusually warm
it may have solved one of our biggest
Global problems which is what happens if
Europe plunges into darkness and cold
so I was looking for stories
that would connect the two big headlines
it was sort of missing
because it seems to me that global
warming is the reason that Europe Will
Survive
right
because all the experts told us that
there isn't it's unseasonably warm is
not because sometimes it's unseasonably
warm like it always is you know the
things fluctuate no it's not that the
experts will tell you that whatever you
see that's sort of you know non-standard
whatever that non-standard thing is even
though there's lots of non-standard
things even though they're going to
write an article saying maybe they'll
not conclude
but wouldn't you expect to see an
article that says uh climate change
saves Europe
or doesn't
right sometimes they do that is it true
stories you know did climate change save
Europe
and then the experts say well there's no
way to know
right because when you get to the
experts the the you know if you dig down
in the story it's always going to be
well there's disagreement no way to know
but you tell me that you wouldn't have
seen that story if the warm weather had
made it worse for Ukraine
right if the warm weather had somehow
made it worse for Ukraine's military
defense that would be the only story
the story would be damn it climate
change is also made Ukraine lose the war
but because it might help Ukraine win
the war
there's no problem with that climate
change
I don't see why you would connect those
stories together that would be just
crazy
all right
uh here's two more stories I'm going to
connect together
um
the public schools in the U.S lost more
than a million students since the
beginning of the pandemic
now that's as population is increasing
I assume even with population increase
there was a overall decrease of a
million kids and so some schools are
like shutting shuttering buildings and
they've got funding problems as well as
uh
excess capacity
but uh so they have two problems excess
capacity plus there's always a funding
problem everywhere
but at the same time the schools the
public schools are saying we have too
much capacity
we also have a immigration crisis
what's one of the biggest complaints
about the immigration crisis
is putting is putting a strain on
schools
it turns out the schools
they have a strain of not enough kids
so we're adding the strain of extra kids
at the same time we have a strain of
extra buildings and extra capacity
It's Kind of Perfect
It's Kind of Perfect
now yeah I get it so the the extra
immigrants are not always where the
extra capacity is right but the the
Republican Mayors are the Republican
Governors are trying to solve that by by
bussing their immigrants so everybody
gets a gets a share
now this of course does not solve the
funding problem the public schools might
be underfunded
and that's a that's a pretty big burden
but
is it is it not worth noting
that school capacity in public schools
may not be impacted as much as you
thought
am I allowed to say that immigration is
a gigantic problem
and I and I believe we should control
the Border absolutely and then make
smart decisions about you know how much
to open the door and when
so I'm very much I'm like a maniac on
strong borders
but
if you're worrying about the capacity at
the schools might not be as much as you
think
right some schools will be over capacity
some will be under but it's just not as
bad as it could have been
what
all right I'm so proud of you
I am so proud of the people watching
this right now
because I was sure
you are going to be blaming me for being
an open border person
and I see that you I've somehow managed
to do the impossible I somehow managed
to have created an audience that can
handle nuance
and can handle looking at both sides
how about how about this for you
seriously like I don't know sometimes
you can't tell what I'm joking totally
serious I'm very impressed right now
absolutely oppressed because the the
usual thing just isn't happening
good for you good for you
all right
um The New York Times sports
um Twitter site did a tweet and said
this about the Dana White and his uh his
slapping contest with his wife there
um three days after TMZ published a
video of UFC president Dana White
slapping his wife at a nightclub neither
the UFC nor his most important Partners
is signaling that any meaningful
consequences are coming for white
huh
so so the Tweet says
after he slapped his wife
that that nobody's going to do anything
about it huh is there any other way that
that headline or tweet could have been
Rewritten that would be true
totally true but maybe capture the
situation I don't know a little bit more
adequately well I took a shot at it I
took a shot at it so here's what the New
York Times sports tweet could have been
an alternative headline
um three days after Dana White's wife
attacked him the public wonders why the
victim of the attack has not yet been
punished
was there anything wrong with that
did you see any factual problems with
what I just said
he was the victim of the attack
fact
Shia first that's just a fact that well
what do you call somebody who is hit in
an unprovoked way
the aggressor
no we call that the victim we call that
the victim now if the victim
defends him or herself
are they no longer the victim
I feel like they're still the victim
because if somebody tries to kill you
and you get lucky and you kill them
instead I think you are still the victim
they don't call the person that you
killed in self-defense as the victim do
they think they call that the
perpetrator who had a bad day that's a
that's a perpetrator with a bad day his
wife is a perpetrator who had a bad day
she perpetrated a physical act
he ended it very efficiently and quickly
and neither of them were obviously
trying to hurt each other now if any of
this situation
looked to any of us like either of them
actually wanted to hurt the other whole
different situation
but that didn't happen I watched the
video you watched the video it was
obvious they both is obviously she
couldn't hurt him he's a big guy right
there was no way he she could hurt him
and it was obviously he held back and he
just gave her sort of something similar
to what she she gave him so obviously
both of them were trying to avoid any
kind of serious danger been married for
26 years they're both good with each
other none of our business none of our
business but you know what is really
messed up this New York Times sports
tweet
imagine treating the victim as the
perpetrator and wondering why the victim
the victim wondering why the victim
wasn't punished
and and and I read this like this is
okay
like there's no sense of embarrassment
they just put that out there like that's
just a normal thing to say that the
victim should be you know what what's
wrong with punishing the victim more why
isn't that victim more punished
all right
here's a story that uh
is tragic
but also funny
is that my fault
if a tragic story is also funny
is that always my fault no sometimes I'm
just the victim of that I'm a victim I'm
a victim of two coincidences a tragic
story
that's also funny it's also funny
um the report is that a Russian sausage
Tycoon
made his money in sausage
and he was also a lawmaker but he was a
sausage Tycoon and lawmaker he dies
after a three-story fall in India
um and uh
he I believe he was also a Critic of the
uh Putin's uh military action in the
Ukraine
so this poor sausage Tycoon because
you know sometimes I don't know if
you've ever been to a hotel
if any ever been to a hotel that a
balcony you go out in the balcony and
the balcony is I think about four feet
tall by law
and
it's so dangerous you go out there and
the balcony hits you about here and if
you're walking fast you're like whoa
right over it and then you die
or you'll just be standing there you'll
slip you'll right over the balcony
or let's say you're you're pouring a
drink and like something slips out of
your hand and you reach forward over the
balcony and then you fall right over the
balcony I mean
if you've ever been near a hotel
you've seen the number of people falling
off the balconies have you not I mean it
looks like 9 11. you'd stand there for
10 minutes it's like watching a like a
meteor shower like it's not every moment
but you just stand out in a big hotel
you'll see people dropping
oh
all right all right it's been a while
okay there's another one so it makes
perfect sense
and I see nothing suspicious about the
story
that yet another critic of Putin has
fallen out of yet another hotel window
because we all know how common it is
I mean probably you've barely you've
barely survived some falls on a hotel
windows yourself I'm guessing
now why do you think the sausage Tycoon
was a Critic of Putin's military action
in Ukraine what would a sausage maker
know about
war that involves sending lots of poorly
trained conscripts
into sort of a very heavy military
you know bullets are flying and bombs
are going off and they're they're con
scripts so they're not like expected to
win their
they're sometimes called other names
some you know diminishing their
importance but he's a sausage maker how
how could a sausage maker How could a
sausage maker have anything to add to
the Ukraine oh
okay
I get it
yeah Ukraine is actually a sausage maker
turns out he was actually the most
qualified person to look at that
situation and give you an opinion
so if you want to know about Ukraine
talk to the sausage makers that have not
fallen off of Hotel balconies and I
believe there's still a few
still a few sausage makers who have are
clinging clinging to the balconies and
not yet died
now here's another thing if you're going
to kill yourself
you know because I think it might have
been labeled no foul will play if you're
going to kill yourself
a third story window is the way to do it
isn't it
a lot of people would go up higher
to guarantee that they don't survive
because you wouldn't want to survive
that right there wouldn't be much left
to you but I like that the sausage maker
he's so he's so precise
that he just he only goes up as far as
he needs to because three stories that's
just a good solid
75 percent of the time you're going to
be deceased 25 of the time you'll just
be crippled for life
but this sausage maker just knows how to
do it right he maybe he stuck the
landing
and maybe you stuck The Landing went
head first
yeah so could have been an Epstein
situation where you know it's hard to
imagine how we could die
you know jumping off the bed it's hard
to imagine but if you have somebody
really skilled they can pull it off like
a sausage maker for example
so it's bad to be a sausage maker
um
we learned from the Twitter files Matt
taibi reporting that Adam schiff's
office asked Twitter to remove some
journalists
that shift in like and there were
journalists looking into the Russia
collusion hoax
so this really happened
that a member of the government
a senator
his office actually asked Twitter
to get rid of the people who are
investigating
The hoax he was playing on the country
they asked Twitter to get rid of
somebody who was investigating a hoax
that really happened
right that was a real thing that
happened
now
is Adam Schiff already drummed out of
the Senate
nah nah
as a normal business for the Senate
you know I keep hearing uh
Tucker Carlson saying as clearly as he
can that he is completely aware of the
corruption in Congress
as in he can name names he knows what
they're corrupt for or what they're
doing and I was feeling that
there are a lot of people who live and
work in that that life
they probably all know the names too
you know it's just not Tucker's job to
you know turn around turn a rumor into
news
but everything you thought about Adam
Schiff was true it turns out all right
there's a nasty story about
um
Republican Matt schlapp
uh what's his official job he's not an
elected official he's working he works
for the rep does he just work for the
Republican National Committee
RNC okay he's a prominent music TV a lot
mesh lab now The Daily Beast
that I'm going to start by saying
reports right no credibility in this
report not saying is not true I'm not
saying it's false I'm saying that the
source we don't have a name for
is described in general but we don't
have a name for there are no other
Witnesses so you have an anonymous
source
in a in a political moment
and he's a political guy
and it's reported by The Daily Beast
that's everything that signals a fake
story
would you agree
that's every element that you expect the
story to be debunked later fake story
right I mean it's a very it's very
non-credible Source now I want to be
clear
I don't know what happened and what
didn't happen would you agree that I'm
I'm not talking about what happened
that's unknowable I'm only talking about
whether it's believable based on the
source it's not believable
it is not even a little bit believable
remember innocent until proven guilty
and you need evidence to be proven
guilty
now there if some evidence ever comes
available I will speak to it but right
now you and I don't have any evidence
you and I have a non-credible
publication
from a anonymous source
that is always the lowest level of
believability and the least likely thing
to turn out to be true
right now
um You may notice a pattern which I'm
defending all citizens against all
accusations
because somebody needs to I just feel
like it's a public service like somebody
needs to take the hit
because you know nobody likes it if you
defend somebody especially somebody
who's unpopular right nobody likes it so
I'll take that I'll be the
what do you call it the public defender
um so he's absolutely innocent and there
is literally no credible evidence to say
he's not so that's my starting point
however
he's so he's blamed for trying to fondle
the crotch of
uh
some staffer for Herschel Walker so
Herschel Walker staffer one of them was
driving and they were in a car and
allegedly somebody tried to fondle a
scratch or he tried to fondle something
scratch now
it doesn't sound real does it like even
the accusation because the accusation is
not that he grabbed once and then
um and then was rebuffed the accusation
is that after being rebuffed he kept
grabbing
really
I mean you know guys are dumb but
everything about the story sounds wrong
doesn't it
all right however
because we live in the simulation I'm
sure
I have to note
the schlapp's name half of his actual
last name is lap
s
so
if you were going to start a rumor that
wasn't true
uh here's how to do it
to start a rumor that isn't true
you start with some stuff that maybe
people were suspecting a little bit
right
so I you know schlapp's married with
kids and
uh
anyway
that's all I've got to say about that
there's just no credibility to the story
but we'll keep watching
all right
um what's the difference between
audience participation in audience
manipulation
so let me tell you what gets you blocked
really fast in my world
um I like audience participation
so I like the comments
and I like I like when people suggest
ideas and I like when you give me
information when you send me links to
stuff
great especially ideas for the comic
strip great
and can I take a moment I'd like to
welcome all the clot Birds they're on as
many today but the the few that are
there shout out to the clotberts thanks
for the fans all the fans coming in
um cope cope
anyway here's an example of a tweet I
got today
and you tell me is this audience
participation or audience manipulation
Scott man pull it together you're better
than this there are many of us who
respect you and would like to be able to
continue doing so
uh
don't ever do that
don't ever be that person
here's what I never want anybody to tell
me Scott you're better than this
no I'm not
no you are what you do
you are
what you do
if I did something I'm not better than
that that's exactly what I am now you
might like it you might not like it but
it's exactly who I am because I did it
right the only thing I am is what I do
I'm not my internal thoughts I'm not my
wishes and dreams I'm just what I do so
don't tell me I'm better than what I did
you cannot be better than what you did
because what you did
is who you are
right
secondly there are many of us who
respect you and we like to be able to
continue doing so
I am never
going to let your decision about what is
respectable influence what I do
because I have my own like little uh
foldy gray thing in my skull and I get
to make those decisions
that I and I alone will decide what I do
and then you and you alone will decide
how you receive it
but what you won't do is tell me what I
should do based on how you might receive
it in the future uh uh
that's not a thing
no no
and I'm trying to do this without using
the f word I know I know usually this is
where I go in hard I'm trying trying to
stay GP as much as I can 2023 I don't
know if I could pull it off but I'm
trying really hard
yeah I don't really care about uh one
trolls
um respect I enjoy respect
should I earn it and should I receive it
I'm definitely going to like it but no
don't tell me to dance oh man
I I almost can't do it without the f
word it's like the f word
was designed for this this exact
discussion
all right but I guess I made my point
um
the Mexican Defense Forces are attacking
the uh one of the cartels
the Sinaloa cartel I guess they picked
up El Chapo's son who is the head of
that and that caused a war of the
cartels attacked the military the
military is attacking them so we saw
some videos of looked like Mexican
gunships firing down on cartel positions
now when you see that how do you
interpret it
do you interpret it as this looks like
the Mexican Government is finally
getting serious about going after the
cartels
because they've they've never employed
this much military weapons against the
cartels so is this is this a sign that
they're now they're going to another
level
what would be another explanation for it
yes thank you one cartel owns the
Mexican Army and it's not this one
to me it looks far more likely than it's
one cartel got got up on you know got
over on the Army and is using it to take
out the competition
it looks like they're taking out the
competition
now it could be just a response to the
fact that the
well actually no it just looks like it
just looks like that
now surely the America America has been
pressuring them to get the head of the
cartel so maybe they just did that
because of American pressure
and that they didn't want to be in this
at all so that's a possibility
yeah so I don't believe anything about
the Mexican military attacking the
cartels
at all
right
um
here's a provocative question
somebody who is trans and before before
I talked about trans topics I like to
remind you I'm very pro-trans
far more than any of you watching here
today under the theory that everybody's
different and they get to decide what
their life looks like
now the stuff with children that gets
into other issues about you know
parental control and who makes decisions
and what's reversible and what's not and
all that
I'd like to make a a more General
comment about the whole area right
without getting into the the specific
things which are important they are
important but today
would it be fair to say
that the trans community
are people who at least at one point
there was a
let's say a conflict or a difference
between what their physical body was and
what their mind was would that be fair
the gender-wise that that their mind
would be one gender
their bodies would be the opposite and
that's that is that is that bigoted
because it might be I like accidentally
or something is there anything about
that that is like opposite of what the
trans Community would want you to think
about them that's that's still fair
right it's just the difference between
the body and the mind
are we right
because this is important I need to make
sure I'm right on that okay now if
that's the difference
uh the way that they try to solve that
in some cases but not all is through
physical manipulation of the body
to get the body and the mind both on
both On Target
but here's the question
if somebody started a business as a
hypnotist and said I'm going to offer
the following service
I'm going to make your mind compatible
with your body instead of the other way
around
so I know your mind says you're whatever
but with your with your consent
will fix your mind so that you're happy
with your body and this and they're both
the same
now could it be done yes yes yes you you
could in fact reprogram somebody to an a
different gender preference
not everybody
not everybody
so that's the first thing you need to
know it couldn't possibly work on
everybody
and not everybody would be better off
from it right so that this has to be
said clearly I don't believe that
everybody's worse off if they transition
I don't believe that I believe that some
people do it and they're happy about it
and they're always happy about it I just
don't know the percentage I'm not sure
anybody does
but
I'm just asking from the pure mechanical
practical sense if two things are out of
whack
and the the problem is that they're out
of whack the problem isn't that you're
the wrong gender right
like nobody's saying you know boys are
evil or girls are evil in this context
we're just saying that they're in a
whack so would it be bigoted
to suggest that the software could be
adjusted to match the hardware when
generally we only think of changing the
hardware to match the software well
would there be anything ethically or
morally wrong now this assumes the
person is volunteering for this therapy
I'll call it therapy you could call this
something else but would it be wrong
and I can guarantee it would work for
some people while also guaranteeing it
definitely wouldn't for other people I
just don't know the percentages but
let's say it's a small percentage
say it would work for 10 of the people I
don't know maybe that's high maybe it's
love but let's say it was
it be illegal
I think it would be illegal wouldn't it
because under our car our current
concept we believe that the mind
is the important one and the body is
just an accessory
right
so if the mind is the important one you
don't want to mess with that but I say
we change our minds all the time
you're not the same person you were your
mind is not the same one you were born
with
right literally cells have been replaced
you know folds and architecture of your
brain has grown you've learned things
you've had experiences it's got a trauma
in it you're definitely not the same
brain you were born with
and if you don't think I could change
you know as a hypnotist if you don't
think I could change somebody's
gender identity
through hypnosis
somebody in the comments is just saying
stop it Scott over and over again
stop what
could you be less useful than that
welcome to all the clock Birds
so if you receive the clot Birds um
talking those are my fans who uh like to
like to use their clever nickname
and and they're and you should know that
their call sign is cope
cope
all right uh well I thought I would
generate more
more pushback than that
but would you agree with the statement
that it would be illegal if somebody
tried doing it
or somebody would try to make it illegal
right away
because I think what would happen is
here's here's the problem it questions
their mind
instead of their body
I don't know if you're allowed to
question somebody's mind
in our woke world I don't think you
questioned you know somebody's mental
state
but if they ask you to change it
I know that seems fair to me
all right
um
[Applause]
let's see
um I would like to go to the Whiteboard
now for what I call the NPC explainer
and as you know
I speculate that we live in a software
simulation like a game
and that some of us are authors and
players in the game
and others are just scenery NPCs
and I'm looking for a way to identify
the NPCs I'm not sure I have it yet but
it's a double whiteboard time
see I forgot what was on the side
oh okay
so I've been talking to a lot of people
who disagree with neon
a lot of things
and here seems to be a basic difference
between an NPC and a player
during during a period where there's
let's say a new headline but you don't
know what is true and what is not yet
let's say I call that the fog of War
so in the earliest days this is the time
scale so in the earliest days of any big
event
the NPCs start out certain
and then they just stay that way
the players are gathering information
and they're starting uncertain and over
time their their level of confidence
increases they may never reach the level
of certainty
but you know statistically they're a
little more confident a little more
likely but the NPCs they start out uh
completely confident and stay that way
now you might say to me Scott
why does that happen
like why would the NPCs
be completely confident
without actual data or science
well I can answer that
that's why we have two sides of a
whiteboard
because this is what
logic and science looks like to an NPC
they they use instead of instead of
waiting for data and science which is
unreliable I think we all know that
science has been a mass lately so the
NPCs are doing the best they can in a
world in which the data that we get is
useless
all right so I have great sympathy or
empathy I guess I have great empathy for
the NPCs because they live in a world
where you can't you can't believe the
science frankly you just can't believe
it so they do the best that they can
so the user common sense
they use pattern recognition and this is
what they tell me so this is from
feedback on the internet because I asked
them how can you be so certain
without without the information yet and
they go oh yeah we've got our pattern
recognition our Common Sense we have our
wisdom and experience these are words
they use
they've got their instincts and their
their gut feel
now
they also look at studies as information
comes out and they pick the ones that
agree with them
and call those the good ones and then
when there's a study that disagrees with
them they call that a poor study now is
that an insult to NPCs
is there anybody else you could think of
any other group that's not an NPC
that only believes the studies that
agreed with what they already thought
well what would be an example of some of
their class of people who does that
everybody scientists
that's what scientists do
the the entire story of the pandemic was
scientists
looking at studies that agreed with them
and then saying those are the good ones
that that's that's just what we
experience there's no difference between
the NPCs and the scientists on the
question of do you do you promote the
studies that agree with you
have you seen the the the Rogue doctors
Dr McCullough uh Dr Malone
when when they tweet a study is it ever
a study that disagrees with their
opinion
I haven't seen that have you ever seen
that no every every expert
only picks the studies that agree with
them it's no different if you're an NPC
or a scientist
right now you now I know what you're
thinking Scott Scott
science is a whole system that maybe
maybe somebody could try to get away
with something in the short run but
you've got to catch them with your peer
review you're going to catch it with
other people look at the data you're
going to catch them when the study is
reproduced and they can't reproduce it
so yes I get it Scott sometimes science
scientists can be a little biased
themselves
but over time over time science will
drive out the bias
did that happen
is that what you saw in the pandemic
nothing like that happened no nothing
like that happened it was all political
and cognitive dissonance and everything
else so if you think I'm insulting the
NPCs
because they picked the the the studies
that agree with them nope
that's just normal that's just normal
how about the date of the degrees with
the same thing whether it's the study or
data everybody everybody accepts what
they agree with
um and then and then I've been told
repeatedly
that they got the right answer because
they believed the
um let's say the Rogue Outcast canceled
doctors
and they said that's that's a group
that is more reliable so the reason I
got it right is because I believe the
the you know the the Rogue doctors were
fighting against the mainstream
all right now what would you
collectively is there any word
that you can think of that would
collectively would capture the logic and
Science and decision making of an NPC
what would be one word you think I'll
let you see it well one stubborn fun
what do you think
and the clot birds can play too you just
have to use the word clot in every in
every answer
so the cloud Birds you should always
just say clot and then your opinion
confirmation contrarian ego
okay I I have a suggestion here here's
another word that captures all of this
process
magical thinking
magical thinking
yeah it's the opposite of rational
thinking
do you know what common sense is
common sense
is magical thinking if Common Sense were
an actual thing we would all agree
we wouldn't have any discussions if
Common Sense were real it's not real
how about pattern recognition
well I guess you wouldn't even need
science would you why would you need
science just use your pattern
recognition
pattern recognition
can tell you something's up
and it could also be seriously
misleading
all of confirmation bias is from pattern
recognition
the the operating system of human beings
is confirmation bias
it's not truth it's confirmation bias
and confirmation bias is because we
think we see patterns
yeah but there are patterns everywhere
the world is mostly false patterns
something that's a coincidence and it's
just that that's all it is so that's
magical thinking
wisdom and experience is just other
words for these things it's just magical
thinking and how about instinct or God
feel magical thinking
do you know why science was invented
science was invented because none of
this is real
that that's the whole point of science
if you could figure out what was real
without science
if you could just use your common sense
and your pattern recognition and your
wisdom and experience in your gut feel
well then that would be science
that's what we would use
the reason we don't use these things is
that they're not real these are the
things that people think are real the
illusion
the magical thinking
so the NPCs start with magical thinking
and then it never stops
so that that's how they can be certain
in in the fog of War
because they use magical thinking and
that works everywhere so actual rational
scientific thinking is useless in a fog
of War
because you can't trust any of the data
so the actual players
they know they can't make any decision
because they can't trust the data and
then maybe over time
you know the the process
create some clarity
now what do you do
it if you can't trust the science and
you can't trust the data and you can't
trust your common sense what what is the
best way to play it
how would you play it if you believed
you just couldn't trust any of these
methods
probability thank you yeah observation
and probability so observation is a good
answer too you sometimes you just
describe it
right so I try to do that when it's just
a fog of War I just describe what people
are saying I don't I don't believe it
and I tell you not to believe it I tell
you that often don't believe it it's
just what's reported right so the the
schlap story is a perfect one
so the accusations against schlapp are
fog of War
and the NPCs are sure they don't
all right
there are probably some NPCs watching
how many of you know what's true with
the mattish lab story
just admit it just say you know you know
it did happen or you know it didn't
happen do you do you know
at best it's a calculation
right so everything everything about the
pandemic
anybody who talks about the pandemic in
terms of certainty
is an NPC and using magical thinking
everybody who talks about it in terms of
likelihoods and odds and you know
playing playing taking their best chance
and guessing well simultaneously you
know trying to improve the quality of
their understanding of their data those
are probably thinking people
those are people who have some rational
capability you know humans are limited
in the rational capability but they
would be among the better ones right so
this rule of thumb is so good
this would be the best rule of thumb
about the pandemic
everybody who talks uncertainty
is an NPC
you don't even have to have a
conversation with them right now some of
you speak uncertainty
because it's sort of a shortcut it's
easier than saying well I think 90
chance right so we all do that
but once you get into the conversation
that's that's when you can add your
Nuance it's like okay I think there's a
90 chance this is true and then somebody
can say okay that's rational
you know I might disagree with the 90
percent
but I like the fact that you're treating
it as a likelihood or a percentage right
that's that's where rational people end
up
now
how good are people at predicting the
future
generally speaking
how good are people that predict in the
future
some are decent that's the answer I was
looking for yeah the uh the answer I was
looking for was that some people are
really good at it
yeah how many of you believe that
how many people believe that some people
are good at predicting the future
no that's not a thing
that's absolutely not a thing that's an
illusion
in in the world of Finance
you know the finance world is gigantic
and there's nothing that would be more
valuable literally nothing
literally nothing would be more valuable
than being one percent better at
predicting the future than the other
people
nothing could make you richer than being
one percent better
than the average of the other people
and yet doesn't happen
doesn't happen
because it's all guessing
even in the most you know sort of
logical world of Finance
it's still just guessing
if you think that anybody knew what was
going to happen at the beginning of the
pandemic
you should never talk in public
right you should never talk in public if
you say you knew what was going to
happen nobody knew
yeah you can make some reasonable
guesses but you know good luck right
so one of the uh one of the predictive
methods I use is as you know the the
atoms love slow-moving disasters
which may be among the reasons that you
know Europe will not freeze this winter
so that's actually pretty dependable
among the predictive methods
I think that's pretty good
but that wouldn't be necessarily a case
of me being good at predicting would it
it's more like I discovered a rule
that's good for everybody like that's
not really me predicting I mention it a
lot but everybody who's heard of the
Adam's love slow-moving disasters and
everybody's we've seen how many times it
predicts is just a tool you can say oh
there's a tool all that seems to work a
lot not every time but I'll use that
tool to predict so if you if you made
that prediction you did pretty well
for example
at the beginning of the pandemic we
thought the supply chains
might completely crash
where I was saying publicly every day
nope the law the law of slow-moving
disasters states that we all see the
problem
so that we'll do miraculous things to
adapt so we don't starve to death and
that's what happened that's what
happened now the supply the supply
chains got crushed but we all ate
and we we waited a little while to get
car parts and stuff and prices went up
but we basically figured it out yeah Y2K
same thing right
so
so I would say don't listen to people
can't predict
sometimes you can find a tool or or like
a rule
that does a better job but that's not a
person that's sort of a rule right
um
then the other way you can sort of
predict is assuming that people will
always be people
meaning that selfishness and
self-interest are usually behind most
things
but is that really you know somebody
being brilliant in their prediction or
is it just a rule of life
that has a pretty good track record yeah
that's not about people that's about a
rule that does a pretty good job
how about uh how about this one here's a
tough one
the government is implementing a new
program
all right I don't even know what it is
the government is implementing a new
program is it going to work
will it work
pattern recognition Common Sense
experience observation right so all of
you are on the same page it won't work
but let me ask you this
has the government ever ruled any
programs that work
yes
lots of them what's the percentage of
programs that work to programs that
didn't work what's the percentage
I don't know
busy but but if you're saying there's a
hundred percent chance that the
government rolled it down so it won't
work
I don't think that's backed by any
observation
I think the government has a
probably a better track record than a
startup
and a lot of things that the government
does are being done for the first time
ever
so if you compare it to a startup
probably probably 20 success
you know would you say I think the
government's maybe 20 successful on new
things but they're also good at hacking
on the new thing until it's better right
the first thing that the government does
is kind of sketchy and then they adjust
and improve over time
so I don't know
can you use any any rules of thumb
I mean statistically it's the best you
can do
so do away with your certainty
do away with your certainty there are
some rules that seem to predict and just
identify those but if you think there's
a person who can predict
I mean I've you know I put my record
against anybody's
but I don't even I don't know if I can
for example I don't know if the next
time I predict something I'll get it
right
here's the problem
I wrote about this in my book God's
debris
imagine if you were a penny like a coin
a little coin that people flip
and suppose you had consciousness
but you have no arms and legs and you're
just a penny so you can't move on your
own
but you know you do move
like you're aware that you move because
people pick you up and they move and
they flip you now let's say you know
somebody's getting ready to flip you
and you say to yourself you're a penny
you have no arms and legs you're just a
penny and you say all right
I'm gonna make myself come up heads this
time heads and then the person the human
flips you and comes up heads what do you
say
what would be your interpretation of
what just happened you're a penny you
said I'm going to try to be heads and
then you came up heads
no you would not interpret that as lucky
no you would think you did it
you would believe no you wouldn't
believe you guessed it you would believe
you made it happen
you would believe you made it happen you
wouldn't believe you guessed it now
let's say
it does a second flip
and you get it just a second time
yeah which is not that unusual right
getting two in a row
not that unusual like what is it 25
percent
uh so let's say you get it twice in a
row now what do you think
now you know you're killing don't you
because you're a smart little petty you
see the pattern it's a pattern
you've only been asked twice
and both of them you got right there's a
pattern
or you might say God has intervened
let's say you're you're thinking heads I
want to come up heads but it comes up
tails what would you say then
well if you're a religious Penny you
might say uh that's what I wanted but
God is teaching me a lesson so probably
that's more important yeah I could
definitely make myself come up heads or
tails unless you know God intervenes
because he wants to teach me a lesson
right
so when it was all done do you think
that the penny would think it had Free
Will and could control which way it came
up
yeah it would
it would think that it could control it
it would think that when it didn't work
that you know the god or somebody else
was intervening
that's you
and me were just the penny
when we get it right we think it's
because we're awesome when we get it
wrong we say well something happened
there that you know nobody could have
seen that coming
foreign
within politics I'm most famous for
having a guest
that Trump would become president
in the first time
now is that because I'm extra good at
predicting
well let me ask you this
if I had been wrong
would you have remembered that I even
predicted
if I had been wrong would you even
remember
nope nope
so there's a there's a Survivor thing
going on you remember me because I got
it right
do you think I get everything right
I mean I do like my track record but I'm
probably just biased about it there's
nobody who could predict the future
that's just not a thing
now the the places that I've uh had
success
are because I had special information
that just wasn't available to other
people in the case of trump my special
information is that I've studied
persuasion so I could see that he had
you know Superior uh Talent it was kind
of invisible if you didn't study that
world so I had a special case
there are a few other cases where I have
a special case benefit for example when
we heard that the embassies
were being attacked by a secret Sonic
weapon
I said nope in the future you will never
find a weapon
I had and the reason I did that is I
have extra information
because I've studied Mass hysterias
so if you've studied them you could spot
this one right away
why well it's a pattern
that's the other side I guess it's a
pattern
but not one that's always right
so if I told you I have 100 certainty
there will never be a Sonic weapon found
that would be insane I couldn't possibly
know that but I can know that this looks
just like other uh
mass hysterias that once it gets in
people's head they they feel symptoms
they attribute the symptom to that and
they get talked into it so it's only
because I had special little special
insight
that I could get one right right it's
very unusual so I'm not sure you would
count that
so the the cloud birds thank you again
for making our show
more lively
and uh I think let's all cope
uh you missed the biggie covid and vax
perspective respective dangers yeah so
no nobody can predict uh whether the vax
or the covid will be worse in the long
run
how many of you think you could
how many of you believe that with
current information
um and let's exclude uh people under 65.
because the data is turning pretty
negative for younger people but for
people over 65.
do you think you could predict
that the future potential complications
of the vaccine
are
going to be worse or better than
whatever protection it gave you from
dying
I don't think you can
I I don't think at this point
we could predict that
you know you you end up defaulting to
rules of thumb like oh the government
always gets it wrong and
um
the uh you know big Pharma is always
trying to screw us and you know
statistically is good
all right uh truth thank you for being
the best uh clotter of them all
uh the best club Birds
and I appreciate you coming and thank
you for uh
boosting my signal and showing the
people that I have a fan base I
appreciate it
all right
clutter is assembled
for travel would you give government
biometric data to travel
why would I care I already did
I I use the clear system for traveling
that's where you you uh
it takes your eye takes a picture of
your eye so you don't need ID the same
way after that you just look into it and
it tells you you're okay that's
biometric information I've I've also
given my fingerprints
so my fingerprints are in the government
system because I once owned a restaurant
if you own a restaurant the government
has to fingerprint you did you know that
did you know you can't own a restaurant
without getting fingerprinted by the
government if you serve alcohol
yeah if you serve alcohol you get
fingerprinted by the government
so yeah I've already given my stuff now
I wonder if
uh
I wonder if they have my DNA oh yeah
right my DNA is in 23andMe
which apparently the government has
access to if it needs it so the
government has access to my DNA my
fingerprint my retinal scan
all of my medical information I suppose
I could get it if they had to
all of my banking
all of my location and all of my all of
my communication
how many are you are worried about
losing your uh privacy
you lost your privacy so long ago your
privacy disappeared long ago
the the only privacy you have and I say
this all the time the only privacy
anybody has is to be uninteresting
that's it
the moment you're interesting to either
the government or to the public boom
privacy gone you have you have no
defense except being boring that's it
so that's why I differ from you when we
talk about
let's say uh vaccine passports which I
oppose by the way I oppose them but I
did not oppose them because
that would be the the way we lost
privacy
because to me that's that conversation
is already over
you already lost your privacy
now it doesn't make sense to make it
easier like put it in an app so that the
government can just like turn off all
your banking if they're mad at you
they could already do that
the government can already turn off your
banking all of it they just have to want
to
they're making a little bit easier I
don't know
I don't know
yeah that does make a difference if it's
easier they're more likely to do it I
will give you that if it's easier
they're more likely because that's the
the friction argument right if you
remove friction from something
you're always going to get more of it
if you add friction you're always going
to get less so I like to be consistent
with that
all right speaking of Canada
are you all aware of the story of the
Ontario College of psychologists
who are mad at Dr Jordan Peterson
because of things he has said on social
media
and uh I thought I'd give him a little
boost
this is weird
all right let's see if I can find it I'm
looking for something here
I thought I'd give them a little boost
with a Dilbert comic
and so this is our first draft
but in it uh dogbert is getting a notice
from the this is just first draft
so dogbert's talking to Dilbert
and uh doger says that the College of
psychologists of I'm going to change it
to Ontario says they will pull my
license unless I surrender to a
re-education camp
now the funny thing about this is that
if you're not familiar with the story
this will look absurd
it will look like something that
couldn't happen
what's actually happening like in the
real world that Jordan Peterson is
actually being summoned to a
re-education camp so he can keep his
license like it's actually a real thing
so that's what makes it a good deal
we're coming but then after Dogwood says
that dilber says you don't live in
Canada and you don't have a license to
practice
then Dilbert goes on they are oddly
aggressive for Canadians
and dogberg sips his drink and says
sounds like a sounds like a mental
disorder
so
now here's a little uh
humor lesson
there are two ways to make humor one is
like you know classic setup and
punchline
but another way is simply take something
that's real that people are bothered by
and just sort of Play It Out
like you don't have to add a punch line
you just sort of where would it go like
if this just keeps going what would be
One Direction it could take and then you
have a joke you just play it out like
it's a real world
all right
ladies and gentlemen
that
completes the organized part of my
conversations here
uh Dr Drew has some new information for
me somebody says okay I'll check on that
well it's a good reframe for physical
activity
um good reframe for physical activity I
wouldn't um it's the systems versus
goals so the reframe for both diet and
exercise are to not treat them as goals
treat them as systems a system is
something you do every day that you're
slowly moving toward your objective so
you'll see lots of description of how to
build a exercise and diet system that
makes it easy
so so you want to get rid of your
willpower so a system will get rid of
your willpower and just turn things into
habits so you're just automatically
doing
the right thing so read my book
that you can't see had it failed almost
everything and still went big
right there and that has a chapter each
on diet and Fitness
what's that
why did the simulation make Scott so
afraid of the head cold
what made you so afraid of shots
one of the funniest uh NPC things I get
is that people tell me that my decision
to get my decision to take
a insufficiently tested new technology
is because of my fear
I'll just say it again there's actually
people who could live and
people who live and walk and can work
and stuff and they actually believe
that the person who took the risky
experimental treatment
primarily for the benefit of other
people because remember at the time we
still believed it might stop the spread
so part of my
contribution to society was I thought
huh maybe it won't make much difference
to me but if I take this
dangerous potentially
dangerous shot I might be good for other
people and that's what you call being
afraid
right
so so doing something that's extra extra
dangerous according to you
is the sign of somebody being afraid
right so you have to you have to figure
out which of the two you want to be if
you want to say it was a scary shot that
everybody should have known would be
dangerous
you can't also say I'm a coward
for doing the thing you're afraid of
you could say it was the wrong choice
and you might be right you might be
wrong we might have a debate there
you can certainly say you believe it's
the wrong choice
but to say that I I did the scariest
thing the thing that scares you so much
you won't even consider it that's how
frightened you are
if I did the thing you're afraid of
why are you calling me a coward
you have to get your your criticisms
lined up
all right so either a brave person who
made the wrong decision
I think that's the best you can do
uh you're calling my decision foolish
really
so there's somebody here who just
watched me explain
that the NPCs were had certainty and and
the rest of us were guessing
so I was in a bad decision
was it because you use your
pattern recognition and Common Sense and
wisdom and experience instead of the
science
it sounds like you missed the first part
where I was mocking you
all right I'm going to say goodbye to
the uh I got hold on somebody says I
guessed it too soon
no
I said on day one I don't know if I want
the shot or I want to get covet right
and there are hundreds of people will
confirm this I said out loud many times
I'm going to wait as long as possible
to and not make a decision
so that I have as much information as
possible
I also said that historically most of
the problems like side effects of
vaccinations happen soon after the
vaccination so that if I waited six
months which I did or longer I don't
know six months or so if I waited six
months most of the danger would have
already been surfaced but not all of it
can't be sure right
and then when I made the decision is
only because I could fly
so in other words I made the same
decision as Dr Robert Malone
at the same time
he also got vaccinated to fly
because that's the only way you could
fly internationally and that's why I did
it and I believe we both waited
until there were some force that made us
get vaccinated because I had the option
of
doing a reasonable job of social
distancing kids never social distance
by the way
for those of you who said I was
frightened to death of the virus
just FYI
the kids the kids and the wife never
social distance
not even little
that they would get home from school or
you know Zoom class or whatever and they
would just all get together with friends
with no masks
yeah there was no social distancing at
my house
we just pretended you know in public we
wore Mass if it was easier than not
wearing it but it was all pretend so if
I had been afraid of the virus I
wouldn't have allowed you know unlimited
unvaccinated people to interact with me
it was just happening every day
I I didn't do anything even close to
social distancing and by the way
everybody who says that social
distancing didn't work
nobody ever tried it
we didn't really try social distancing
there was a little social distancing
theater but once people got home
as soon as nobody was working all the
mass just got thrown on the ground yeah
no nobody did any social distancing
there was a little bit of theater that's
about it
all right
um I was going to say goodbye to you
YouTube for today and I'll talk to the
locals people for a little while
