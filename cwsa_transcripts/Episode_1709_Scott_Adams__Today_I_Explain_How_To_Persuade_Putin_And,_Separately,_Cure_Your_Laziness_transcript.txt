good morning everybody
and welcome to once again
the highlight of human civilization and
possibly some aliens who came before we
don't know we don't know can't rule down
and today i'm going to blow your mind
even more than the
mushroom trip without the mushrooms
that i took you on the last time can i
do it
can i
can i move my whiteboard so it doesn't
look like there's a weird point coming
out of my head
i'll bet i can i'll bet i can i did yeah
today's a double whiteboard day how
lucky are you
that sounds lucky
yeah
two whiteboards now if you're listening
and not watching i will describe them
they're not that complicated but
i know you get excited when you see the
double whiteboard and you should but if
you want to take that excitement up to a
new level and a heretofore
unknown level
all you need is a copper mugger glass of
tanker cellos just die in the canteen
jugger a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
and it's
called the simultaneous acceptance could
happen now go
so
uh for the past two years or so i
started noticing a weird pattern in my
life
and i want to see if anyone else has had
any similar pattern
it goes like this
i wake up in the morning i say to myself
oh what's the plot twist gonna be today
and there is one every day
every day
i wake up and there's a plot twist
i'm talking about something so unusual
that it looks like it came out of a
reality tv show
you know in a reality tv show there's
always a plot twist oh
somebody did something the thing that
you didn't know about
you know somebody talked to somebody
somebody's mad about a thing
and it was
every day
for years
and to the point where i'd i'd go all
day long it'd be like say it's you know
five o'clock
in the evening
and i'd say to myself no plot twist
but then it would come before i went to
bed
plot twist every time now
is it possible
that that could happen so many times on
its own
and i'm talking about
i'm talking about things
that are as mind-blowing as you know
learning out you know learning that
you're an android i mean i'm talking
about really basically mind-blowing
stuff
has anybody had that experience
where you just get a plot twist every
day
or is this some somehow limited to me or
confirmation bias
nope nobody else huh
uh
so okay so people will say yes all right
actually you're getting some yeses here
more than i thought all right
interesting i don't know that means i
think but when i when i asked myself why
we would be a simulated environment
assuming we are because i think we are a
simulation not an original species
why would we exist why would anybody
make us and the answer is to test stuff
or for entertainment
i feel as though
my life has become somebody else's
entertainment
like it looks like i feel like i'm in a
reality tv show but i'm not aware of it
that's what the plot twists look like
i'm like i don't know
these plot twists look exactly like a
writer
introduce them into the plot they don't
look
naturally occurring
so i feel like i'm in some kind of
reality tv show
somebody's watching
all right
um i'll get a little bit weirder now
have you noticed that a lot of self-help
advice and books have one thing in
common
which is positive thinking
have you ever noticed that the most
famous original self-help book of all
time was called the power of positive
thinking um
which i read and was very influential in
my development
and president trump coincidentally
went to church
and the minister i think is is the right
name
uh or pastor i forget what you call
each leader of each church
but i think it was the minister was
actually the author of that book
the power of positive thinking
and trump talks about it you know having
an impact on
so
but other books including my own
had failed almost everything and still
went back
have some element of that at their core
that you have to think right
to get a good outcome
now my version i talk about shelf space
your mental shelf space
and specifically i talk about you can't
you can't stop thinking about something
negative
you don't have the ability to turn off a
thought
people want to but you can't it's not a
thing what you can do
is crowd it out with other thoughts just
be busy
keep your mind somewhere else and you
just will take up the time the shelf
space so to speak so there's just less
room for the negative until you kill it
by atrophy
so the less you think about something
the less power it will have over over
time
so there are all these different you
know fields of self-help that all have
this core
about thinking
positively
and i found out just this week
why that might actually work
because haven't you always wondered why
it works or does it work i mean the
first question is
does it work i don't want i'm not trying
to make you think past the sale
does it work
and if it does work why does it work is
it just
do we imagine it works
is it purely
um
some form of placebo where you just you
think it worked but nothing happened
well here's something i just found out
whiteboard number one coming at you
yeah
good times
all right here's why it might work
turns out that if you are exposed to a a
positive feel-good thought or experience
that your dopamine will improve
so for example if you love kittens
and i handed you a little kitten
probably your dopamine would would go up
a little bit and your dopamine has a big
impact on you your happiness right
but here's the part that i hadn't quite
appreciated i knew that dopamine feels
good
and that was hard to be happy without it
and i knew that if you had the right
kind of you know
stimulation you could produce more of it
but here's the part i didn't know
that
dopamine has two primary purposes if you
want to think of it that way
one is a reward the thing that makes you
feel good
but the other is it's implicated in
movement
you don't actually do anything
until your dopamine is in the right
state and if your dopamine is low you
end up with parkinson's
so the reason they treat parkinson's
with l-dopa
is to give you a little more
dopamine boost
to cure your randomness of motion
if you want to move in a particular
direction or toward a particular thing
you need your dopamine to be in line
and so
we we have a
a logical
science based
completely
non-controversial explanation of why
positive thoughts
might get you to the place you want so
imagine if you will
that you spend your time thinking of a
positive thing that's going to happen to
you like oh i'm going to have this
promotion or i'm going to live in a big
house
have a nice family
fall in love whatever it is that is your
thing and you're thinking all these
positive thoughts about the future
and those those things create dopamine
and then what kind of action do you
think is going to happen
the only thing that we do are the things
we imagine we can do
that's it the things you imagine are the
things you do
you never do something except
i guess like accidentally
that you didn't imagine
you know even driving to work in the
morning is you sort of imagine it first
and then you can do it
you gotta imagine it
so
imagination does seem directly related
to re producing the chemical that
creates the motion
toward the thing
it's actually just that simple the
things you think about
the things you imagine are the only
things that activate you
and if you think about positive things
it activates you in exactly the right
way
and if you spend your time thinking
about negative things
it would activate you the different way
and so maybe it is this simple
maybe it's that simple
now
here's the part where i blow your head
off
i i didn't even get to the good part yet
what if
what if
laziness is a habit of thinking about
the cost of things or the effort
instead of thinking about the payoff
i'm going to say it again
get a few more heads to explode what if
laziness
is nothing but a habit
of thinking about the effort instead of
thinking about the outcome
what if you could reverse laziness
by simply developing a habit
of thinking more about the
let's say the delicious food that you
would like to enjoy instead of how long
it would take you to get up and go get
it
holy is right
[Laughter]
holy is right
it might be that easy
so this is one of the reframes or the
type of reframe that i'm going to
include in the the book i'm working on
because i can't prove that this works
but
do i have to
i mean it seems so logically connected
that it's hard to imagine it doesn't
work it'd be hard to come up with an
argument that this
chain of events doesn't reliably work
so
uh but the but the real question is if
you were to test this at home
and try to see if you can think more
about the good outcome and less about
the work
would you get it done
why is it that people have a second
child
you know why does a woman who goes
through this awful awful childbirth
have a second child
don't they always say the same thing if
i remembered how bad this was i wouldn't
do it again
right
so the the not thinking about the effort
is vital to actually the survival of
humanity
if we focused on how hard it was to have
a baby you just wouldn't do it or you do
you do too little of it
but if you focus on how awesome it would
be to have a family
well there you go
you're going to go through the pain
because you've already you've already
committed
so
uh and i have this experience with
writing books
intellectually i know that writing a
book ruins almost a year and a half of
my life i mean it really really puts a
wet blanket on all your free time if
you're writing a book and you have to
think about it all the time so it's
really a big expense
on top of your normal career if you have
a regular career as i do it's not as bad
as all you do is write
so the way that i can write a book is i
have to forget about how hard it is
and just think about how cool it is to
have a book if it does well you know i
imagine it doing well and people
people talking about it maybe having a
difference so i think about all these
positive things and then i can write it
so am i
am i ambitious
or
do i simply have a thinking habit which
produces dopamine because i'm thinking
about the positive outcome and is the
dopamine the thing that gets me up and
moving
and when you're observing me you say how
the hell do you get so much done
right well the the single
probably the most common question i'm
asked in my entire career
is how do you get all that done
because you know you know i have a
variety of things going just the things
you see now imagine the things you see
multiplied by the things you don't know
anything about
you know because because you see me
cartooning you know i have to write a
cartoon every day
on average i don't work on it every day
i do this live stream every day
sometimes twice trying to write a book
you can imagine how much administrative
effort there is in just keeping the
operation running then on top of that
you know a personal life
trying to keep my my house this being
remodeled the construction project
that's just a sample
it's like
like you you have no idea
if you could imagine how complicated my
life is
you wouldn't even believe it
right
and how do i do it
i think it's just this
i think it's just this when i think of
all the things i do i think about them
in terms of their benefits
i love doing this
like right now like at this moment
i'm about as happy as i'll be all day
that to me this is excellent this is a
great great experience
because i don't know
i'm not even sure exactly why i like it
i i guess it's a variety of things that
makes that makes it a good time for me
but
i didn't really think about the fact
that i had to
spend two hours preparing
you know i
i was up at
2 30 this morning couldn't sleep
so i you know i spent maybe two hours
preparing for today but i never once
thought about the two hours i only
thought that oh this would be fun i
can't wait to you know turn it on and be
doing this thing so here's your tip it's
going to change some of your lives
think about the positive not about the
work and see what that does to you
well in the news boris johnson visited
kiev and walked around the city
seemingly safe
with zielinski
now
so the russian troops have
they have pulled away from kiev right
that's a done deal isn't it
didn't ukraine win
wasn't that clearly the you know the
objective of russia was to
take keeve and put in a puppet
i mean
i feel as though if you look at the
primary goal
that russia lost and
they've already admitted it
now i know what you're saying the russia
is clever what they're going to do is
consolidate things in the south and then
they'll start moving toward the capital
again or they'll squeeze them out or
they'll blackmail them or something
maybe
maybe
but
it kind of looks like they lost and they
know it
so they're consolidating their forces in
the either region that don bass and
whatever the regions where they've uh
got victories and they seem to have
control
but
here's the thing that
um
i don't quite get
has putin figured out how he could
occupy ukraine in the long run
because i know see how you can do it
and this is what i mean in this specific
case
isn't it just a number of drones
let's go to the second whiteboard
are you ready for this
i know one whiteboard is a lot to absorb
but
two wow
i know i think you can do it
second concept
of the day
[Music]
persuading putin
would it take to persuade putin first
answer
nothing
nothing would persuade putin putin
cannot be persuaded he's crazy he's
hitler he's made up his mind maybe
good chance that good chance
i would however
submit to you that there's literally one
piece of data
and you don't even have to be accurate
that would persuade putin that he
already lost and that he needs to figure
out
how to manage the defeat
right now he's still managing the war
the the best persuasion would get him to
manage the withdrawal or manage what the
defeat looks like
so here's the one piece of data
that would persuade putin
to stop now
stop focusing on the fight
because putin might win the fight
am i right if i said to you who's going
to win you know in that area of ukraine
and maybe even the rest of ukraine if i
said who's going to win militarily
what would all of you say
it depends how determined he is
if he's decided to take it
he's going to take it
and it looks like he has it looks like
he's decided to take it and
it looks like he will
but then
what but then what
he has to hold it right the whole point
is to occupy it
he also took
you know all that area around the
capitol
but he didn't hold it
so what was the point of taking it
so
here's the thing that uh i think the
news needs to report or maybe not
maybe not i'll tell you why is how many
of these portable drones the the
switchblade type
um
can be delivered to ukraine and in what
time because there's a theoretical
number of them
which we could reach and i'm just i just
threw in a month here this is a random
month
maybe by the summer
maybe by the end of the year if ukraine
held on
how many of these could they get now the
switchblade drones let me let me give
you a demonstration
that is so amazing i think you'll be
impressed you will watch this
if you're watching on uh or if you're
listening on audio
this won't be impressive at all but
watch how well i do this so you've got
this little
backpack and then you backpack it you
take out one of these switch blade
drones
and i i think it fires out of a tube
and it comes out like a like a missile
but in the air
once it's launched its wings go
like a switchblade
no like this
so that it becomes a little plain i
think it has two wings actually front
and back
and then
it can fly
several kilometers
so you can launch these things from far
away
the military person who fires it
then has a little monitor i saw a
picture of it looks like it looks like
you know you can cover it from outside
distractions like light
and just puts on his head and then he
can see the drone
then the drone
can fly for many miles looking at the
terrain and then it gets to a place and
it can just kind of hang around for
i think
10 minutes or something how many minutes
somebody will tell me but you can hang
around for a long time just looking down
as the soldier who's in the remote place
is watching it
and then it can just pick out a target
and just
destroy it
now somebody says 15 minutes it can
hover
now here's my question
how do you defend against that
now quick answer is the way you defend
is with electronic means right you jam
them
has the jamming worked so far
have you heard any story that says you
know all these drones aren't working at
all because there's those russian
jammers are just
jamming them up
no
no in fact you're not hearing that at
all so either russia doesn't have good
jammers
or the work around for the jammers is
simple enough that it's not slowing them
down
i imagine that the jamming equipment
itself is fairly identifiable isn't it
couldn't couldn't you see the jamming
equipment or at least know where it is
or locate it
i mean there's probably anti-jamming
munitions
of some kind
but they also have to turn it off now
and then did you know that
just turn it off
and the reason they have to turn it off
is they often have to launch their own
drones
so the ukrainians would wait until the
russian military launched their own
drones which required turning off their
own anti-drone jamming equipment and
then they'd attack
so that's just a sample of you know the
the military back and forth of you know
adjusting to each other's tactics
but as far as i can tell there doesn't
seem to be any permanent way
to stop these switchblade attacks
and so
since they can be launched by from a
distance it takes one person to carry
them and one person to launch them
isn't the only thing that we wonder
about is how many there are and how
quickly we can get them
i think even training is not a huge deal
i i think you could probably watch a
youtube video on how to use them
they're built you know to be used in the
field not by a
not by an engineer or scientist now of
course i need i need a
fact check on that but my belief is it's
probably not a lot harder
than operating a
commercial drone that you would buy
online and
buzz your neighbor
but it's not that much harder
because they wouldn't have designed it
to be that hard they would have to
design it to be simple
there are many defenses against jamming
yes
one of the defenses against jamming is
to
have your signal vary in real time
so if your signal is varying in real
time the jamming doesn't it may not be
widespread enough to to hit the right
frequency so you've got your jamming
your anti-jamming et cetera
all right so my question is this
if we wanted to persuade putin could we
persuade him that he will lose the
military battle
answer is probably not
probably not because he just has to
decide how much pain he wants to take
and he probably can take as much as he
needs to to get it done so instead
persuade him that occupation is
impossible
not improbable and not hard
actually impossible
impossible
right so you can't say it's going to be
really really hard that gets you nothing
because he's already committed to really
really hard
it has to be impossible
and i do think that he could be
convinced that has some number of
switchblades
blade drones or and and the like you
know similar similar equipment that is
some level
you can't hold them
here's the question for you
where would the occupying troops
how would they sleep
would they have to sleep one person you
know in a mile away another person
wouldn't they be in a barracks
i mean they're not gonna be underground
are they is the occupying force going to
be underground
yeah i don't think you could hide all of
the military stuff
i believe that you know once a night a
military barracks would blow up under
occupation
probably once a night
how do you keep your military motivated
to keep the occupation up if one of
their barracks blows up every night
right
and that's just the barracks imagine how
many other things they could blow up so
i don't think there's any way
to hold or to occupy a country
militarily
uh well there are two ways it if putin
had taken keeve
instantly
and put in a puppet might have worked
do you think
if putin's original plan as we imagine
it was we don't know but if his original
plan was just to quickly put in a puppet
i think that's worked before partly
because the public says ah you know the
last one was corrupt too
it doesn't make that much difference i'd
rather just go to work today you know
one puppet gets replaced by another
puppet
that might have worked
it might have worked or at least for a
while
but that didn't happen
so now that it's a destroy the country
down to rubble
uh i think the ukrainians are a little
bit angry and motivated to do whatever
it takes to change the situation and if
they have unlimited drones or at least
an unlimited stream of them coming in
how could anybody occupy the country
i don't think it could be done because
you have enough people to use the drones
and enough drones
so how do you persuade putin the
question is
if we're here hypothetically
meaning that not enough drones have been
delivered to ukraine to stop an
occupation
just just enough to you know maybe give
them a little uh pause
but how long would it take us and could
we is it even possible to get to the
number where even putin would say okay
that's impossible now that's actually
impossible there's no way to occupy this
country
do you think putin
knows how many
of drones are being shipped and do you
think he knows where the crossover point
is
he does not
he does not know how many we're shipping
how many we can ship
and he doesn't know what the crossover
point is
that's why
we should make one up
just start saying there is one
because whoever goes first defines
the talking point
so if none of us have any idea in our
mind how many switchblades it would take
to make ukraine impossible to occupy
let's create that number
is it 10 000
imagine seeing headlines starting to
come out that says
ten thousand uh ten thousand
switchblades make ukraine
unoccupiable
they have four thousand already
by summer
they'll have fifteen thousand
it only takes ten thousand
to be unoccupiable
now
is that true
does it
matter it might not matter because we're
talking about persuasion we're not
talking about truth
and if you can convince putin in putin's
mind that that number 10 000 actually
makes a difference it would have to come
from some kind of military source some
kind of logic to it you need somebody
who's a
military i don't know a strategist or
something some west point person to say
it so you get somebody to say it
and then you get the media to repeat it
right now that shouldn't be hard because
it's pretty clear that the corporate
media is working for
uh
working for our intelligence agencies so
if the intelligence agencies say
you know wouldn't it be nice if you guys
start talking about
the country being unoccupiable
and that the reason is drones there is a
certain number that make them
unoccupiable putin doesn't know what
that number is but wink wink we're
getting there really fast
wink wink we think it's about ten
thousand
that expert said ten thousand we got
four thousand now we're going to have
fifteen thousand by august
doesn't matter if any of it's true
does it
it only matters if putin can't tell the
difference that's all that matters
so
this is uh persuading putin
you you should take this as a lesson in
persuasion
not a prediction i don't i don't think
it's necessarily anything like that will
happen
all right
what would happen
so i think a lot of people were
surprised to see the russians
uh retreat from the capital of ukraine
uh
the one person i know who was not
surprised was me
i believe the one person who said no by
the way i was totally wrong on the
prediction that putin wouldn't invade
and the reason was it would be suicide
and i thought he could tell
apparently i could tell it was suicide
and he couldn't
now that i did not see coming so for
that's on me
being smarter than putin was not
something i foresaw in any of this but i
was
apparently or better informed or
something i mean i got it right and he
got it wrong
that's all i know for sure
so um but i got it wrong that he
wouldn't invade because i thought he was
more rational and at least as smart as i
am
um
but
what would happen
so you might have been surprised but i
wasn't that he didn't quickly take over
ukraine and i said the reason would be
the modern modern weapons that they
would have
and that the modern weaponry would be
surprisingly effective and sure enough
it is so my exact prediction at least on
that part was right
here's the next part
what would happen hypothetically
if it looked like ukraine was starting
to block
the retreat routes for the russian army
just just imagine it
suppose it looked like their military
strategy had changed
to
preventing russia from leaving with
their military
because that would say they're going to
starve them and kill them
and that they think they can get it done
i'm not saying they can
i'm saying what would that do to you
mentally
if you heard that your retreat was being
destroyed
when they have limited weaponry in
ukraine and they should be attacking
things like you know tanks and weapons
depots but what if they destroyed the
retreat
because that would also destroy the uh
presumably the supply routes so
destroying the supply routes would
destroy the retreat wouldn't it if there
was just literally no way to get in and
get out
somebody says it's a bad strategy it
makes the other side fight harder no it
makes the other side starve to death
they might fight harder but they've got
a week to do it
because they're out of food in a week
so fight hard
but you got a week
could they do everything they need to do
in a week
i don't know
so
um i i just wonder about this as a
persuasion play less than a military
play which you know becomes military of
course
but uh wouldn't that get into the
russians heads
if you acted like you were going to trap
them and starve them and you look like
you might actually pull it off
we get in my head
well i saw a video on the internet carl
icahn the famous uh corporate raider who
buys companies and
uh you know fires a lot of people and
turns them around and then sells them
and does stuff like that
and he was talking about this one
company bought years ago 30 years ago or
so in which after he bought it he was
trying to figure out what all the people
did
and there were there were 12 floors of
employees there
and when he tried to go in and figure
okay what do all you do
when they explained it to him he still
didn't know what they did and they hired
consultants to come in and figure it out
for him and he paid him a quarter
million dollars and they came back and
they and they said you know being honest
we have no idea what they do
so he fired all 12 floors
with no no precision he just fired all
12 floors
and he said that
years had passed and nobody had
complained yet
in other words he expected
somebody to say okay we can't deliver
that product or we can't do this thing
because you fired the department in
charge and nobody ever nobody ever
complained everything just went fine
operated smoothly
now that's not the real story
the real story is that elon musk uh
interacted with that video
uh in a positive way and i think he said
just one word exactly
and this is right after he bought
twitter
and maybe wondering what all those
people at twitter do for a living
now that's not the only thing he's doing
here here are some of the things he's
done just the last like 24 hours
he tweeted should we delete the w in
twitter
which of course would turn it into a
naughty word titter
now
now let's let's uh
let's contrast this with
what i just talked about carl icahn
tesla famously has no marketing
department
because uh elon musk can do the entire
marketing job just by making interesting
products
and tweeting
and that's it he doesn't even need
marketing
and so
elon buys nine percent of twitter
he tweets should we delete the w in
twitter
and he did more work than the entire
marketing department of twitter
with uh one two three four five words
five words
the whole job of the marketing
department of twitter
uh so i guess that's one floor you can
get rid of
he also tweeted
this is all in 24 hours it's just
mind-boggling he asked why the top
twitter users in terms of number of
followers no longer tweet he says is
twitter dying
and he paints to like he points to like
taylor swift and
justin bieber and stuff and i guess they
haven't tweeted in months i didn't know
that
so he says is twitter dying it's his own
investment
it's his own investment and yes if it's
dying
who does that
somebody who doesn't have a marketing
department
that's who
because if you don't have a marketing
department i don't know a better way to
get attention than to ask if you're if
your product is dying
do you remember he did something similar
with tesla stock
do you remember when he said he thought
tesla stock was too high this was a few
years ago
who does that
who says their own stock is too high
i believe it drove it down
somebody give me a fact check on that i
think he drove his own price stock price
down did he not
that actually happened
didn't it now one of the things that
that did
and also this thing about twitter is
twitter dying is it builds credibility
which is aside from money and aside for
being super smart
his credibility is his big asset that is
hard to match right he's neither
republican nor democrat you don't know
what the hell he is he just wants things
to work
and
and so when he he questions his own
product the thing he invested in
questions his own stock price
it's impossible not to give him more
credibility isn't it
it's impossible not to say okay that's
credible because if it because if you're
if you're criticizing your own product
and going to the moon
okay we're going to listen to that right
that sounds pretty credible
so he's got that going for him
and he also asked should
the twitter blue apparently twitter has
a service
called twitterblue that you can pay
three dollars a month
and
i guess you could you have limited
ability to edit your own tweets and uh
you don't see advertisements or
something i don't know what else is
about
but i didn't even know twitter blue was
a thing
i mean i
had slight awareness of it but i didn't
know what its features were
but now i do
[Laughter]
yesterday
yesterday i didn't know that twitter had
this new feature
which i actually would consider paying
for
i don't know
might have something i want
and
again twitter's entire marketing
department didn't penetrate me with that
information
but elon musk just did
and what he asked is should all the
twitter blue users get a blue check
and the answer is of course not
of course not that would defeat the
entire purpose of the blue check
but it's a perfect question
if you want to get rid of the marketing
department
it's just a great question because it
just makes you think about it it's not
it's not like he's leading you to some
specific answer
so no twitter blue users should not get
a blue check because that's not what the
blue check is used for
but uh now we all know there's this
feature
but it but it would give you uh you know
let's say to his point
if you gave everybody a blue check who
paid for it it would kind of democratize
the influencers right because right now
if you have a blue check like i do
you get more attention
is that fair
should i get more attention
because
people
try to impersonate me on online
which by the way has been a big problem
i don't know maybe but it gives me too
much influence for the wrong reason if
the reason i get a blue check is so that
somebody doesn't uh imitate me
that's good
but if then that blue check gives me
more influence than my opinions or voice
deserve
well then it's bad and i think maybe
elon might have noticed that who knows
but elon also mentioned again in the
last 24 hours
that
if you get twitter blue
you wouldn't get ads and maybe
twitter should be a service that doesn't
serve up the serve up corporate
uh influence
so if you have a subscription service
you're not as influenced by um keeping
the the sponsors happy
that's a good point and it gets to
freedom of speech and bias and
censorship and everything if you just
make a subscription
but
would enough people buy a subscription
to twitter
and if you're not willing to pay three
dollars a month for twitter
should you be tweeting
should you
three dollars a month if you're not
willing to spend three dollars a month
how important do you think your opinion
is
that other people should hear it i don't
know
now
uh looks like we're having some network
interruptions on one of the platforms
um
i don't know what that's about i don't
see a problem on my end my my wi-fi is
screamingly good today
all right um
so watching watching elon musk dissemble
a company
in real time right in front of you
is probably the most interesting thing a
business model nerd could ever see and
that's what i am i i'm really nerding
out on business models like how do you
make a business all the parts work just
right
so i'm just sort of a
student of business models and watching
him
he's effectively dismantling twitter
psychologically first
right he's already redesigned a new
twitter in your mind
he's engineered the damn thing in your
mind you know it doesn't have corporate
influences the blue checks are handled
differently you can edit maybe
um
so he does it first in your mind then he
can sort of a b test it based on
people's influence and then probably can
get it done
in reality if people are on board with
it
uh and i love watching him do things
that only he can do
that's really special when i watch uh
basketball on tv i don't really care who
wins
i want to see what stephen curry does
or lebron james
because they're just not like other
people
it's like watching a superhuman do
something
and
watching elon do what only elon can do
because he's the only one rich enough
influential enough
knows how to
you know manage the psychological
elements of it
cares enough about it i mean he's the
only one
i don't think there was anybody else who
could do what he's doing right now with
twitter and it it's super important
it's like
he's rewriting the source code
or maybe the operating system of america
because we went from you know okay free
speech and it's in newspapers and
randomness but once power got
consolidated into the social platforms
with twitter i think is the important
one because twitter is the one that
influences journalists
and then journalists influence everybody
else so twitter is like the leverage so
of course elon finds the most important
lever twitter
finds a way to have the most leverage on
it without buying the whole company nine
percent
and now he's digging in and he's going
to re-engineer the thing clearly
i i don't think there's any doubt he is
actually going to re-engineer the
product
and he might actually fix the biggest
problem in the country which is
we can't trust anything we see or read
think about that he might actually fix
that
and i'll say again there's nobody else
who could have done it
the the ultimate
patriot
if i may say that
the ultimate patriot
is the one who does it because nobody
else can do it
now that might be including just going
to war right you know picking up your
rifle it needs lots of people to say
well if i don't pick up my rifle
you know
i can't depend on everybody else to do
it for me
so
the the fact that he just jumped in to
the biggest problem in the country at
least the lever that controls the
biggest set of problems
and that he might actually get control
of this thing and he's letting you watch
it while it happens
this is thrilling stuff this is just
thrilling
you get to watch as he does it right in
front of you
this could not be cooler for a nerd like
me
anyway here's the thing i used to hear
as a kid um have you ever heard this
saying only god can make a tree
only god can make a tree
i don't know why but you see her that
all the time when i was a kid
but uh today um
mark zuckerberg is creating meta a
virtual world in which
mark zuckerberg is gonna make about a
trillion trees
so it turns out that mark zuckerberg can
make a tree
now you're saying to yourself
that's not a tree
that's that's like a picture of a tree
that's like a digital tree
nobody's gonna be confused
about a digital tree
versus a real tree
so take your stupid analogy and
shove it up your stupid
whatever hole
and get out of my face with your dumb
thoughts that's what you say that's what
you say to me
and i deserve every bit of it
but here's my counter if we're a
simulation that is almost certain that
we've been programmed not to notice
that our simulation
is simulated
that would be sort of basic to the
program
that the people in it are programmed not
to notice
code don't ever notice that you're
simulated because it'll make the whole
thing not work
right so
let me give you a little preview of
what's to come
so let's say meta becomes a big hit i
think it will
you will have an avatar there will be
some representation of you it might be
an animal or something but it'll be the
one you you select
that avatar
will be doing stuff in meta whenever
you're online
but only when you're online right so if
you're not online your character
probably won't
won't exist
but
it seems inevitable
that with artificial intelligence and
improvements in the artificial
environment
you will want an option where your
character does some things while you're
gone
for example
it might go to work
there might be an economy there you
might have to send your avatar to work
when you're doing something else
maybe your avatar will mow the lawn go
to bed
who knows
but over time the the amount of things
that your avatar can do when you're not
there
should increase
just because everything gets better and
more and you know developed to a higher
level and more features
so what happens when most of what your
avatar does is when you're not there and
a little bit of it's when you're there
and then
and then
you die
what happens then
you can have this avatar that could
actually live autonomously
forever
because if if uh
if facebook meta doesn't find out you
died
doesn't your avatar just keep on going
like an afterlife
and couldn't your relatives visit you in
the
the ai version of you in the afterlife
could they not enter the simulation
through the you know
the goggles or whatever and go visit
their deceased relative who lives on
in an artificial form
now for most of you that artificial form
wouldn't be a good representation of you
it'd be you know you know in all the
most surfacy ways it would be sort of
like you
but what about somebody like me
where my entire mind is basically been
sprayed into the universe in ways that
are easy to collect
these videos
i mean if you collected all of my live
streams you'd have a pretty good idea
what my opinion is going to be on the
next thing right
because you know how i think you know
how i approach things so and ai could
create me
put it in an avatar and make it live
forever in the meta
in the metaverse
you know that can happen
and that little version of me suppose
just suppose that as some future version
of technology suppose it optionally
learns
or is
programmed
to not notice that it lives in a
simulation
oh you can do that
you can make your software always not
notice it lives in the simulation
whenever there's a glitch it just
doesn't record it
so
am i reborn
because it's going to have my
personality it will be based on me
and just as i sitting in this chair
don't have uh probably any cells of my
body in common with the baby i used to
be all my cells are different
it's all different cells i mean same
same dna
pattern but i think all the parts are
different by now right they've all worn
out and been replaced so this would just
be a new replacement part
it would just be a digital replacement
for a physical entity and it would live
forever and it would just have a life it
might learn things that would have been
interesting to me in life
well that's what's coming
so i do believe that uh mark zuckerberg
after
becoming the founder of facebook said to
himself well how do i top that
like the only job that's better than
being the founder of facebook would be
what
god
and then he became god
of his own simulation
not of this emulation he's not he's not
god of you
but he's going to be the god of meta
and that means that what you can and
cannot do in his simulated universe will
be decided by him what's that sound like
god
and it's not even like a dictator
if it were a dictator you could still do
the things you're not supposed to do but
you know you would be punished
in meta
the god or whoever controls the the
programming can just say these things
can't happen
just completely stop you from doing
things or give you powers or heal people
or anything else within medic
so yes zuckerberg is becoming god of his
own simulation
uh the individuals in it will still have
something like free will or the
impression of free will but he will
determine what they can or cannot do
like god
he actually found a way
he created facebook
and still found a way to get promoted
if you're not impressed by mark
zuckerberg now
i mean i was impressed when he started
facebook
i was about 10 times more impressed
when it turned out he was a great ceo of
a mature company
didn't see that coming i mean that's
really rare isn't it you could say bill
gates did it but it's rare
and
uh and now he's promoted himself to god
of assimilated reality
not bad not a bad mark
well the china lockdowns are uh
bad and i was reading a tweet thread by
naomi wu
and she's she says things are quite bad
in shanghai china has a long and ugly
history of famine displacement and civil
unrest the social contract we have is
basically
uh no more of that and a steady
and a steady improvement in quality of
life and we won't quibble too much so
i'll say that in my own words
so she's saying
that you know with her knowledge of the
the local culture
she says that
there's a social contract and basically
an understanding
that uh
the civilians won't rebel against the
government
even though the government does a lot of
things they don't like and limits their
freedom in a number of ways they're not
going to fight it
so long as the government keeps them fed
and sort of moving forward
and they have
since the government has kept them fed
and has kept them moving forward and
hasn't done forced displacements except
the uyghurs i guess
um then naomi's view is that that's all
it takes
so as long as they keep those just basic
social contract things in place you're
not going to see anything like a
revolution it's just not going to happen
but here's where she warns there's
trouble
the lockdowns
are a risk of of starvation
and if the chinese
feel that that trigger gets pulled in in
their minds now this would be naomi wu's
point of view i'm i'm not the expert
here but in her point of view if famine
kicks in it's a whole new game
because that that means the social
contract has been violated
what's that mean
like
could things just turn on a dime is it
is it that sensitive
that a violation of the social contract
specifically famine
you know within the lockdown areas
if the government can't get them food
and
you know get it to him without anybody
dying of famine
uh they better do it
because probably the whole system
depends on it now according to naomi
wu's reading of her own
uh culture
the ap is reporting that u.s intel
officials think putin
might use ukraine as a pretext to
interfere in our next election
russia collusion 2. here we come
is do we ever have new news or is it
just the same news all over again yes of
course there will be reports of
russian interference to help whoever is
the republican candidate
and do we believe the ap story that the
u.s intel officials think that
i don't believe any of it
i don't believe any of it
all right
interestingly
cnn has a opinion piece on their site
by essie cupps
i think she used to be a republican can
somebody
give me a fact check on that but she's
been sort of anti-trump for a long time
and you know a staple on cnn
and
she wrote that obama was wrong
you know about russia being the jv team
and he was he was wrong to mock romney
when romney and the debate
against
obama said that russia was our biggest
strategic partner and obama mocked him
because he said it was china and now
romney's right
it looks like
um
so the content of the story isn't so
interesting as the fact that is on cnn's
website
so cnn has a
major
critical story about obama
on their website
what do you think of that
does does it feel like something's
changing over there
because they've changed management right
and i believe that their new management
said something about reporting real news
for a change
am i right about that now this isn't
news it's opinion but
i don't know that i would have seen this
opinion before or or do you think that
they're just trying to get romney to be
the candidate
oh is that what they're doing
do you think they're just trying to
support romney to mess with the
republicans because because part of the
criticizing obama was to say romney was
right
but i don't still i can't see
i just can't see cnn throwing
obama under the bus even for some clever
plan like that
i don't see it
that's too clever i think
i don't see it
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
there's a conclusion of my prepared
remarks
um i think i've cured many of you of
your laziness i've rewritten your
operating code
taught you the secret of uh how to
succeed it's all about the imagining the
good outcomes and the dopamine
and i've given you a single data point
that can convince putin to stop the war
in ukraine and we can even make up the
number
we don't even have to have a real number
we just have to have the news talk about
it
and
so now that i've cured most of your
personal problems as well as
war in ukraine i think i've done enough
for now
but
because i like extra
i'm going to keep working today and make
some comics and maybe work on my book a
little bit we'll see what goes we'll see
what happens
but
um i think you can all agree
this live stream was
a highlight of civilization probably
100 000 years of
humans in our form
and
nothing better than this so far
this was about about the best and i
think you agree
now
join me for a little bit of a
boost in your dopamine
think about something awesome that's
going to happen today
or something awesome that will happen
next few years even better because you
can keep that one for a few years
just think about something awesome and
watch how much better your day is and
that
is the end of my program i'll see you
tomorrow youtube
