good morning everybody and welcome
to the peak experience of your entire
life it's called coffee with scott adams
and everybody's talking about it
now just before i signed on here on
youtube i was talking to my
subscribers on the locals platform and i
was about to give them a
tip for persuasion
so i'd like to share with all of you
since we're all here at the same time
and the tip is this one of the most
powerful things you could ever say to
somebody
when you need their help solving a
problem and something that you really
really really need that other person to
help you with
it goes like this
i don't think there's any solution to
this problem
but i thought i'd run it by you
watch how hard somebody will work to
solve that problem
it's almost diabolical it's so
persuasive if you say to somebody hey
can you help me solve a problem what's
their first reaction
well
i do have other things to do there are
competing interests
and i don't know if i'm going to get a
payoff
from solving your problem it's not
immediately obvious to me
but you know of course many people will
just help you if you ask so we live in a
world where there are lots of helpful
people but if you've got that one where
you know it's going to be a tough sell
you're not necessarily going to get this
person's cooperation
tell them the problem can't be solved
and that the problem lies
strictly within their domain
yeah this is an unsolvable problem but i
thought i'd run it by anyway see if he
had any ideas
that person will work work to their
death to prove that that that they can
solve an unsolvable problem right in
front of you
so that's your tip for the day
how would you like to
take this experience up a notch
yeah
you would and all you need is a copper
micro glass a tanker jello system in a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of what
kind yeah any kind fella with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine
hit of the day
it's the thing that will make all of you
when you're done say
thank you
goes like this
now
now don't you feel grateful
for sharing that experience all around
the world as one
it was almost like we're a
mycelial network
did i say that right mycenium network
all right how many of you are nerdly
enough to know what that reference is
nerds super nerds
what reference is that that's right it's
the new star trek discovery
well in the news
i saw a clip
uh joel pollock tweeted this
uh yeah i saw it in in his feed
that uh jen saki said in 2019 so
remember this is before she was
spokesperson for biden
and she was on jake tapper's show
and responding to some questions she
said quote there have been a number of
moments where even those of us who have
been who have affection for biden think
quote
what on earth is happening right now
now there may be some context missing
there
there often is
but
it makes you wonder if everybody can see
it
however
if i'm being fair
it could also mean that he's just a
quirky old guy
and that you don't always know what he's
what he's thinking when he's talking i
mean it could be just that so it did
sound uh
it did sound frighteningly as if people
were completely aware that he wasn't 100
there
that is a valid interpretation of this
story
but she might have also been generously
saying he's just a quirky old guy we
don't know what he's
thinking uh have you seen the uh the
story about
kanye who i call
yay
because i'm current a lot of you are
behind the times and you still call him
kanye west
so so old
not me i call him yay and uh
because i keep up with things so he's
got this uh i guess he's dropping an
album and one of the
video clips
from one of the songs features a
claymation
animation of
i think kanye
kidnapping uh burying alive and then
decapitating pete davidson
who as you know
has been dating uh
yay's ex kim kardashian
now there is a great outrage
an outrage an uproar
an uproar i say
because such violence such violence now
of course this brought kathy griffin
into the news
because kanye is not the first person
who got in trouble for decapitating a
famous person
in some kind of a uh
fictional content
so
um
i don't know how many of you remember
but i might be one of the few people
that you saw defending kathy griffin
with her decapitated trump head
how many of you remember that and the
only reason i'm bringing it up
is because i like to
demonstrate consistency in those few
cases where maybe i have it
and so my consistency is
it's art
you know you just can't
you just can't judge art
by any normal standard
art is supposed to offend somebody it's
supposed to make somebody uncomfortable
i mean not every time right that's
optional
but an important part of art is its
offense
that's always been
maybe the best part of it
is that maybe it doesn't offend you
but you're pretty sure somebody's
getting offended by that art
i've often said that good writing
has to give the reader the impression
that somebody could get in trouble
you know what i mean
it's like if you see a really funny
person talking about let's say their
family life
don't you think
how does your spouse take that when you
go home
how's your family react to those jokes
or uh what kind of are you gonna get
canceled for that have you gone too far
right so sometimes the the danger is the
artist themselves
but other times the joke is on the
audience norm mcdonald was famous for
that
norm would make the audience
uncomfortable and that was the act
and if you were part of the audience
that wasn't uncomfortable it would be
hilarious to you that he'd made the
other part of the audience uncomfortable
the ship hell be another example of that
yeah
so as soon as you say i don't like this
art because it's offensive
well
i'm not sure that that
makes sense
you cannot like art because art is
subjective
and you can say you know
that that doesn't really fit with the
way i think and
my sensibilities that would be fair
but just the fact that it's offensive
that's art
now okay somebody says it's lazy art and
i'm gonna i'm gonna refute that directly
um
first of all
do you think that a clip of uh kanye or
maybe it was just somebody i don't know
i think it was supposed to be him
decapitating pete davidson
do you think that that approximates how
kanye who wrote presumably wrote it
do you think that approximates his
internal thoughts or his feelings
don't you think that he had violent
thoughts about pete davis and in reality
like actual violent thoughts
probably
could have you ever put yourself in his
head
imagine such
imagine being kanye and you have to
watch
the image after image and story after
story
about the woman who probably you still
love
mother of your children with this guy
now i don't have anything against pete
davidson
he's pretty entertaining
but imagine how you'd feel
if you were kanye now
if you could imagine for one moment how
kanye actually feels in real life about
that whole situation
and then you see the claymation
would you say to yourself i think that
captured it
i think he captured
he captured the feeling
and is there anybody in the world who's
had like similar feelings
that they also have suppressed and
hopefully didn't decapitate anybody
probably
this is probably hitting home with a lot
of people
were mad about somebody in their past
right
now sure decapitation is the extreme and
i don't think anybody would take it as
recommending violence i mean that would
be a ridiculous interpretation
but i would also like to point out
that one of the things that makes kanye
kanye
is that he's always an artist
so this is my interpretation of them
right so just my personal subjective
interpretation
there are some artists who you imagine
to yourself
that the moment they walk off stage
they're a different person
now i don't know that this is true but
you take somebody like drake
i don't know anything about him so this
would just be my impression as an
ignorant observer he gives the
impression
that he probably performs on stage but
is maybe very different in his personal
life
which is not an insult that would be
perfectly reasonable
in fact probably
you know the majority probably most
people are different in their real life
than their
their acting life
but there's something about kanye
that makes me think he's kanye all the
time
in other words he's never not an artist
he's always he's probably always
provoking somebody although he never
walks into a room without somebody
getting uncomfortable about something
it's always art he doesn't know how to
turn it off like you know his art is is
like exploding into
you know fashion and design and you know
donda doing all these creative things
he's looking at building new homes he's
making music he's producing other
people's music
you know
he's just making art
all the time
now another person i would put in that
same category would be snoop dogg
right
do you imagine that snoop is a
completely different person when he's
not on camera
i have a feeling he's probably pretty
similar like you feel like you're
getting the real guy
and like snoop
very much like kanye is art all the time
i don't think he turns it off that's
just who he is
so i'm a
pro kanye on this of course not
promoting any violence whatsoever
um
bloomberg is flailingly uh taking a run
at trump again with this new story and
might i
preface this story by saying the walls
are closing in
the walls are closing in on trump oh
they got him now wait till you hear
how they got him now
and may i also note that it's worse than
watergate worse than watergate my god
it's worse than watergate
and the story goes like this it's
bloomberg politics
tweeted this
and there's a story they they're talking
about it says donald trump's advisor one
advisor
john eastman's emails
may have evidence of at least three
crimes the former president and his
associates committed the house january 6
committee says
now let's parse that sentence
at least three crimes you hear that you
say wow
if there are at least three crimes
if even two of them are
not proven
they're still a crime
so
am i right
if there's at least three crimes here
i'm pretty sure that at least one of
them has got to be real
walls are closing in they're close again
so yeah
and uh but let's read this sentence a
little more closely it says the emails
may have evidence may have evidence well
haven't you seen the emails
why would you say that the emails
may have evidence
if the story
allegedly has seen the emails
and knows the contents
if they don't know the contents
should they say that it may have
evidence of a crime that would seem like
that's gone too far
but if they have seen the emails
why would they say there may be evidence
of a crime
wouldn't they say that's evidence of a
crime
it's not proven
but it's evidence it's right here we're
looking right at it here's the law
here's the email look at the email look
at the law it's evidence of a crime
if there were evidence of a crime that's
kind of how i would write the story
but suppose there were no evidence of a
crime whatsoever
what could you say that was technically
true
there may be evidence of crime
maybe somebody else can see it we don't
actually see it
but you know we could be wrong
there might be some evidence of a crime
in here we're looking at it and we don't
really see it can't really list it
couldn't really tell you what it is
but it may be in there i'll
shake a little bit
so when you see this level of weasel
wording um every every red flag in the
world should come out
all right
now what would be one of the examples of
one of these things that may be a crime
it may be evidence of a crime
apparently eastman
emailed pence
and asked him to delay the certification
of the vote for 10 days
so that they could
find out if there was some irregularity
with the election
now
this is being treated as possible
evidence of a serious crime because it
would be proof
that he had tried to interfere with an
official you know federal process
and that would be a crime
so can we agree that there probably is
some kind of a crime in which if you're
trying to interfere or
or stop a federal
process part of the election especially
i guess that that might be a crime i
don't know i'm not a lawyer but that
sounds like that could be a crime
doesn't it
wouldn't you think
i would think it would be a crime to
stop an official certification process
there could be a law that says that
but now let's look at what his email
said
and let me be his lawyer at court for a
moment let's say this goes to court
which seems ridiculous to me but let's
say he does
and uh and i think eastman is a lawyer
but let's say i'll be his lawyer
i'll be the lawyer to the lawyer and
the prosecution says here you can see
him asking for pence to
delay the certification
that would be a violation of the law
that says you can't interfere with these
federal processes
and then it's my turn to talk
and i would take the email and say
are we are we reading the same emails
because the email that i'm reading
says that john eastman wants to make
sure that no laws were broken
he says that directly
he says they want to make sure that
there's nothing illegal that happened
with the election
this is a man asking
for the process
to be extra careful that it's done right
and that no laws were broken
this is a completely reasonable request
not a demand
if this had been a demand coming from
let's say some authority
then you could argue that it was illegal
this was a request
when does a request become illegal
do you think that a lawyer
puts an illegal request in an email
am i done
is there anything i have to say after
that
in your experience of the world
some of you are experienced with the
legal process do you think that a
lawyer puts an illegal request in the
email
have you ever met a lawyer
that's the last thing they do
there's probably no lawyer i mean i'm
sure
avenatti probably did it
but
aside from somebody like that
you know
the lawyers don't put illegal requests
in emails
that's not a thing
so to imagine that the eastman would
have been aware that what he was saying
was illegal
it's kind of a stretch i mean i guess
anything's possible but it's kind of a
stretch
somebody says idiot lawyers do well i to
me it seems that this is clear evidence
that john eastman thought he was
protecting against crime
so i go to the jury and i say look
i don't know what you're reading but
this is a guy trying to make sure a
crime didn't happen
now he made a request that was turned
down because pence had different
reasoning
that's the whole story
he made a request to make sure that the
law had not been broken
the request was denied
that's it
but the walls are closing in on trump
the walls are closing in
the water world what a world
um here's an example of why movies are
no longer a product
that humans need to consume
there was a time
when uh people like you perhaps people
like me would uh even get in a car and
drive to a place where you could watch
this thing called the movie and for two
and a half hours sometimes three you
would be entertained and delighted
but
something happened
i don't know exactly what happened
but i think one of the things that
happened
is that when movies started requiring a
layer of wokeness
over all of their content
i think it became
kind of
just useless
it doesn't have any use anymore
let me give you an example
uh well first of all
is it my imagination or are pretty much
all movies designed to make the
viewer uncomfortable for the entire
experience
that's true right
save maybe you know the last five
minutes where everything goes right but
isn't the whole point of a movie
to show somebody's you know
uh family is uh is
at risk
why would you want to sit watching
somebody's family at risk
where somebody lost their money
or somebody can't figure out how to eat
or somebody's got like you know a
serious disease it's terminal
why would anybody want to consume that
content
but this story just made me laugh
now before i tell you the story i'll
give you the context in case anybody is
new to me
i'm not only
pro lgbtq
but i'm so pro
there should just be more of it
everywhere
in fact do you know what you never hear
i was driving through an lgbtq
neighborhood and
man that looked run down
and the crime let me tell you about the
crime in that lgbtq community
no
no
so i'm very pro lgbtq and i think that
you know it should be expressed fully in
all content etc so having said that
that's different from
forcing it into every kind of content
that's what ruins the content if you
force it in there
well
you lost the art part
uh and apparently there's this movie
called the power of the dog that i
haven't seen
but there's a story about uh
you know some actor making fun of it and
uh
here's a description of it
i forget where i saw this all right um
it's been praised by many for how it
quote and listen to this sentence it's
been praised by many for how it
thoughtfully deconstructs
toxic notions of masculinity and
repressed homosexuality
against the backdrop of the american
west
gay cowboys basically so it's a movie
and
as as a you know a through theme i guess
gay cowboys
now
brokeback mountain was a critical
success and apparently this is another
critically acclaimed movie
but i'm going to ask you this
is there a lot of demand for gay cowboy
movies
is there
like who are they making the movies for
and again i want to be very clear
anybody who wants to make a gay cowboy
movie and anybody who wants to watch it
i'm all for that
like
very for it i think everybody should get
exactly the entertainment that fits
their
their needs and preferences why not
but
does this look like they're just forcing
too many variables together it's like i
like woke things and i like i like
westerns
why why don't we kind of
kind of combine these two things
now most art
is combining
combining things that exist right so
there's nothing wrong with combining
things that people haven't combined
before that's what great art often is
but
i feel like
there was some disconnect between the
the audience
commercial
i don't know reality
it just feels like that people are
making movies to make a point as opposed
to entertain
the public in the same way that they
used to
but maybe maybe you can't get 100 people
to watch the same movie anymore so you
have to it could be that narrow casting
is exactly the way to go because
there's so much
streaming that you can make a movie for
exactly the the audience that likes gay
cowboy movies and and get like every one
of them to watch it
plus every one of everybody else to
watch it just to find out what
everybody's talking about
so it might be actually kind of
brilliant
so i'll argue against myself there just
you've heard both sides
i've often told you that if you want to
predict events in the world look at
insurance
because once insurance companies get
involved
they tell you what's going to be
possible and what isn't
because they'll price some things out of
and of the market
and
so
um apparently that's going to be a big
factor with these russian sanctions
because when people look at the
sanctions that are being put on russia
right now
the natural way to look at that is to
say okay what is the exact sanction
and who would that exactly
affect
and then if you're smart you say uh-oh
these sanctions actually leave out a lot
of the energy
part of the economy of russia
which is the main part of their economy
so what's the point of leaving out the
main part well here's where the
insurance variable comes in
if you're a company
that was involved in any kind of
business that involved that big energy
part of russia's business
even if you're not part of the sanctions
do you want to take a risk
of getting in business with them even
though it is still legal
and then have something change as in
you know russia
goes out of business or russia gets more
sanctions and suddenly the business
you're in gets sanctioned
so the problem is that the insurance
business
does those calculations for each of the
individual businesses so the individual
businesses don't have to make individual
decisions they just look at their
insurance rate
and they say oh
if i want to
work with this company
my insurance rate just made it
prohibitive
so if you watch the insurance you'll
know what's happening and one of the
things that's happening is reportedly
wall street journal says that
people are looking at their risk reward
looking at the insurance as that
reflects it and saying
even though these sanctions don't really
involve my company yet
it could easily involve my company soon
so i'm just going to get the hell out of
there
so
um i would say as of today the evidence
is that what you thought about those
sanctions
however weak you thought they were
you're probably wrong
you're they're probably devastating
and it's because of the second order
effect where people just say well the
blast zone hasn't reached me but it
could so i'm gonna i'm gonna get further
away from russia
well here's the battle of the narratives
so narrative one this is russia's
narrative or putin's narrative
is that putin is denotifying ukraine
he's rescuing ukraine from the
shelling from the ukrainians and
especially the ukrainian nazis as he
would say it
now
i believe there is truth the statement
that iranians i'm sorry ton iranians i
just did a biden ukrainians
and where is kabul harris to mouth the
correct word when i need her
uh ukrainians
um
so but it is true that uh
weren't the uh disputed territories in
ukraine they were being shelled right
yeah wasn't ukraine shelling
um some people and don't they have some
nazis in their ranks so that's not
untrue is it
it's not the whole story but you know
it's true
it's a little too true
let's just say it that way
so that's the russian narrative as the
putin is denotifying ukraine the
american narrative which you were being
asked to believe
is that putin is an unstable hitler-like
dictator he's losing it
uh and he just has this need to conquer
neighboring countries probably for some
ego or
psychological reason about
national importance and russia's
greatness
something like that
right so that's that's two different
narratives
then i see a lot of independent people
who are not buying into either those
narratives um say that the the real
problem here is that the west
um
in the nato countries especially tried
to turn ukraine into a security threat
for russia
russia has been warning us putin
specifically has been warning for 15
years that if you make ukraine and
georgia nato
that some bad bad stuff's going to
happen
and it turns out that a lot of the
smartest foreign policy people for
decades have been saying exactly the
same thing
saying essentially the rest of the world
needs to understand that russia sees
ukraine as part of russia basically
and that if you made that nato
that's different that's different than
anybody else going nato that's a whole
different ball game and if you do that
you're going to start world war iii
did you know that the smartest foreign
policy people have been saying exactly
this for decades
decades
it's been commonly known by the smartest
people
that if we did exactly this this is
exactly what would happen
and then it did
interesting context isn't it
so that would be the independent
narrative that the west basically
provoked it
now the west's argument would be
uh any independent country can get to
decide who it who it makes a deal with
so yes
yes
in some kind of perfect world
ukraine and any other independent nation
could decide who they ally with
but not in the real world
in the real world this is ukraine and
russia
that's the end of the story
ukraine russia
not like any other analogy as soon as
you say well ukraine and russia is a
little like nope
nope
you're completely wrong already
the moment you make an analogy about
ukraine and russia to anything else
you're already wrong
and your thinking is is gone
although the cuba analogy is pretty good
having said that the cuba analogy is
pretty good
um
then there's scott's narrative
scott being me
nice to meet you
here's my narrative
that the cia has too many russia experts
and the russia experts got to do stuff
and if the only thing that they did was
tell you you know russia looks good i
don't see a problem over there they're
acting pretty well i think we can just
ignore them for a while
that's not what you do if you're a
russia expert
if you're a russia expert you find
problems
because that's your job
you're going to find all kinds of
suspicious stuff russia is doing and by
the way they probably are doing lots of
suspicious stuff
but
the thing you focus on the most is what
becomes real
in this world
do you think that the news that we talk
about every day is the important news
no
sometimes it is
but it's the stuff we're talking about
we're not talking about it because it's
important
it's important because we're talking
about it
you get that right works both ways
sometimes we're talking about it because
it's important a big earthquake for
example but lots of times the news has
told us what to talk about
and are talking about it is what makes
it important
so
i think that if you put too many russia
experts in the cia which we do know they
are
send it kind of heavy with russia
experts
that they're going to find problems and
ways to bug russia
and eventually you're going to end up
with exactly this problem
so that's my take my take is that we had
a system which guaranteed this outcome
the goal
might have been i don't know more
freedom and
democracies and defending ourselves from
russia
like those might have been the goals
but if the system was to hire too many
uh
russian experts in the cia
you're just always going to get this
i think
all right
so which of those narratives is winning
well the longer the actual battling goes
on the more the narratives matter
because
you know the real battle there is for
the you know the i guess the mental
uh real estate
you know when this is done
but think about this if this is done
let's say putin actually
destroys ukraine but conquers it
can he survive that
i mean maybe
but it would be pretty dicey i can't
imagine you that russia would survive
that at least as a functioning modern
society i don't know that they would
scott is finally waking up
so it seems to me that putin can't
really
can't really just destroy ukraine he
doesn't have that option
because i don't think he would survive
it
but he also can't leave
he's kind of trapped
so somebody's gonna have to figure out a
way out and uh i don't think anybody's
figured that out yet
all right um
i'd like to give you an example of
sarcasm misuse if you would like to use
sarcasm
let me tell you the correct way to do it
it should have something to do with
something that somebody else said or
thought
if your sarcasm is something you just
made up
it doesn't really land
it should actually be you know directed
at something that somebody else said or
thought
otherwise it looks kind of random
i'll give you an example
chris buskirk who is the editor
publisher of am greatness
responded to a tweet in which i
mentioned that the
russian invaders uh might be running out
of food and
gas fairly soon
specifically the uh
the caravan 40-mile caravan that's
stalled
and here was uh chris's uh attempt at
sarcasm
lol
try getting some news from legitimate
sources not regime propaganda when was
the last time you were right about
something and didn't just repeat what
you heard on msnbc
do you honestly think
tanks need gas and armies need food is a
hot take
now
that's not how you do sarcasm
first of all
he has no idea who i even am
apparently
this is his first exposure to me
because if he thinks i'm repeating msnbc
talking points
he has not spent a lot of time consuming
my content has he
so now problem number one
doesn't even know who he's talking to
number two
here's how he frames my argument do you
honestly think tanks need gas and armies
need food is a hot take
no
no i don't think that's a hot take
nor did i say that
so the sarcasm if it's about an
imaginary person saying imaginary things
well it doesn't land
doesn't land here's what i think i think
of course they thought about resupply
but i don't think they're getting it
right
i think it's hard
that's all
is anybody disagreeing with a basic
statement that resupplying a 40-mile
caravan in the middle of a war in enemy
territory where you have a well
well-armed and dedicated uh ferocious
army fighting back
does anybody think it's easy to resupply
them
i'm just saying that that might be a
little harder than than maybe they
they thought
but there's some interesting things
we're learning about this
what's happening now
number one
uh jillian turner reported that there's
some european official
who thinks he knows that the chinese
government actually asked putin to delay
the invasion until after the olympics do
you believe that
do you believe
that china actually got russia to delay
until after the olympics
it looks exactly like that
doesn't it
i'm going to say
90 yes
90 yes because i mean it just looks too
much exactly like it
i don't know that this european uh
official has any inside information that
might be dicey but i don't think there's
any doubt about it i mean the timing
would be too weirdly coincidental
here's a question that i've been
wondering about
i've been reading that we we know almost
nothing about putin
because putin's inner circle is
impossible to
penetrate
that
as good as our intelligence is
we can't really get inside putin's you
know enclosed circle
but somehow
despite not being able to get into
putin's inner circle our intelligence
knew exactly what russia was going to do
and when
what's going on here
how is it
that we knew exactly what putin was
going to do
and when
so much so that um and i'm going to give
the biden administration a lot of credit
for this
a lot of credit
right this is full-throated credit
there's there's not going to be any buck
you know but trump could have done it
better or anything like this is just
full credit
the way they laid out russia's plan
about the false flags and what they were
going to do
was brilliant it was brilliant it's one
of the and
in to a large degree it's why the world
is uniting
because it was so um
so transparent
and the united states made it so extra
transparent
that it really framed the thing
basically the united states framed the
situation first
and whoever frames it first has a huge
advantage
and
that was brilliant the way the way the
biden administration handled that part
of it
leading up to the war was just brilliant
there's there's no qualifier on that
that was just plain brilliant
but how they do it
do you think that we have maybe
better intelligence on the inside than
putin knows
or is it yeah it could be ai you're
right ai could have done it
if ai didn't do it
you could imagine that it could do it
just by recognizing assets and the
movement of assets so yes
it could be that it was just the
movement of assets
it could be that russia is so
predictable
that this is exactly the way they
attacked finland
so if you were to look at um
1939 1940
stalin attacking finland
they're using the same playbook
so it could be
that our intelligence people were just
smart enough to know that you don't have
to have any intelligence on it you just
look what they always do
and then you say well they always do
this and they always do it in this order
so we'll just tell you in advance what
they're going to do and then they did it
because they always do it and they
always do it in that order and part of
it is always
the uh we're definitely not attacking
you
we're saving you
so they always do the no we're not we're
not conquering you
no no we're liberating you we're saving
you we're saving you from yourselves
and then they'll do the false the false
flag attacks
so
yeah
it happened just the way they said
so
um
there are some more interesting things
that came out of this and really
interesting actually
so how would you like to be in a
40-mile military convoy
that's stalled in enemy territory
and apparently
these this the heavy equipment can't
really get off the paved road
because the
the modern stuff is such that they won't
get out of it
so you have to be
you have to be in a three wide column
for miles and miles you know some of it
is spread out but a lot of it is
concentrated
you can't go forward
you can't go backwards and you can't go
sideways
and you probably can't get food and you
probably are having trouble getting gas
and that's not your biggest problem
i think
i saw a tweet by an expert and i tweeted
it if you want to see the details in my
twitter feed
and there there's a
gentleman
called trent tolenko
whose job in the u.s army had been
similar to what there must be in the
russian army
somebody in charge of maintenance for
the big equipment and here's a little
detail
that is really
interesting
i don't know how much this explains but
it could explain all of it
and he saw a picture
trent did
of one of the wheels coming off one of
the german vehicles and stuck in the mud
and he describes how big vehicles like
this have a tire inflation system
so that the tires of this big equipment
can be inflated and deflated as they go
so they don't have to you know get out
and put air in them they can inflate and
deflate for the type of terrain they're
on now i imagine it would be
harder inflation for
you know the road and maybe lighter
inflation if they're
in something where they need some
traction just guessing i don't know
but
the problem is if you don't exercise the
tires and that system
it gets brittle
and by exercise i mean if you don't have
actual use for the vehicles you have to
make sure that you inflate the tires and
deflate them on a regular basis
trent was looking at one of the just one
picture but one picture of a russian
vehicle with that maintenance problem
and recognized it
as a poor maintenance problem
in other words it looked like that
vehicle had not been what they say what
they call exercised meaning had not been
inflated and deflated to keep the the
tires um in the right
non-brittle state i guess
likewise he mentioned that if you park
the vehicles where the sun can reach
the tires
that it damages the tires
and again makes them the wrong makes
them too brittle
so you have to rotate how you're parking
the vehicles and you have to exercise
them
and the suggestion is that the russian
army was not competent enough or was too
corrupt to do that and that that 40
miles of
it's possible that that 40 miles of
convoy
has enough bad
poorly maintained stuff
that it really can't go anywhere
it may never be able to go forward it
may never be able to go back it may
never be able to go sideways because
that's where the mud is
it may already be captive
in related news
turkey has delivered what they call a
batch
of new drones
to ukraine
ukraine says they're already using these
new drones the batch we don't know how
many is in the batch
the batch
um to
to attack uh columns or convoys i guess
they call one of those
now i don't know if that includes the
40-mile column because
isn't it weird that there's a lack of
reporting about that being attacked
here's what i think
i think our intelligence has determined
that they trapped themselves and they
could just leave them there
i think there might be a point
where that column becomes hostages
because you can see the
you can see that the russian army is
looking to siege or starve kiev
and you can see that the russian armies
have cut off supply lines of the
ukrainian army in the south
so you have sort of a starvation
standoff here
i believe that the ukrainians could
destroy the entire column
40 miles of russian military i think
they could destroy it all now
because i think they're trapped i don't
think they can go anywhere
and and obviously if the ukraines are
operating
i'm sorry if the
if the drones are operating
have you heard of any drones being shot
down
i mean maybe but apparently they have
enough drones in the sky now how many is
a batch
how many is a batch of drones
and how many would you need
because i think uh i think ukraine had
20 some said 10 drones
but now they have a new batch
what is the theoretical number of drones
it would take
to guarantee that russia couldn't
conquer and hold ukraine
there is a number
how close are we
and that number could be 20.
because if the russians can't get off
the paved road with their heavy
equipment
i think 20 drones could actually hold
the whole country
if they can't shoot them down now if
if the first thing the drones do is take
out the anti-aircraft
which i imagine is possible right
can't they take that out first if you
take the anti-aircraft first
you just take your time with the rest of
it
and i would think that even if you lost
five or 20 drones
you could pretty much take out the
entire column
now imagine if you will
that
the armed citizens
know where this 40-mile column is and
that they may already in towns and
locations all around there already
getting closer to it
how many citizens with aks
on both sides of a convoy
would it take to take out professionals
i mean
maybe you can't do it maybe the
professionals just have too much
firepower
but
i think
um
yeah i think that the convoy is going to
have some trouble and they may be in so
much trouble that ukraine could actually
trade the life of the convoy
for some other
some other accommodations
this is
insane you know i don't think i've ever
said anything that somebody didn't think
was insane
at least nothing in public
almost anything that i say in public
any prediction
somebody says this is absolutely crazy i
mean you've lost it now
every time it doesn't matter the topic
it doesn't matter what i say every
single time
now could i be wrong yes let me say let
me say as clearly as possible because
somebody's going to say scott
uh
you said ukraine was going to win
and then russia won
no
no i i'm not saying russia i'm not
saying ukraine is going to win i think
that's completely unpredictable
i am saying and have said from the
beginning that russia doesn't know how
hard the fight will be
and largely because of modern weaponry
would you say that my initial
contrarian opinion
that russia would run into surprisingly
good modern weaponry
and get bogged down
would you say that was accurate
i mean it was it was more accurate than
all the experts who said it would take
48 hours
can you compare my non-military
expertise
to the military experts and tell me how
i'm doing so far
okay
so far
so far the military experts said it
should have been over in 48 hours
i said
no it's going to be way harder because
of
modern equipment and russia maybe has
never faced this modern equipment
have they ever faced uh modern drones
where did where did russia ever go up
against modern drones
where did they ever go up against this
many stingers and anti-tank weapons
nowhere right
am i correct am i correct that no
russian army has ever faced these
weapons
i think i'm right
except in small amounts right well in
syria they would have small amounts but
not nothing that would make a difference
so
so i ask you again i i want i want you
to give me a direct answer
i said that the russian army would
be surprised by the modern effect the
effectiveness of modern weapons the
experts said in 48 hours they would own
kiev who was right all the military
experts or me
say it directly who was right
it's funny how many of you are avoiding
that question
somebody says the experts
some are saying me
all right
now
again
do the experts have a problem
is there something about experts that
makes them so often wrong
what is that right
i mean i'm not saying the experts are
always wrong that would be ridiculous
the experts are usually right it's just
in these
weird little fog of war situations they
just seem to fall apart completely
you know whether it's the fog of war the
pandemic or the fog of war ukraine i
think the experts just completely fall
apart under that scenario
now i'm not saying that i could always
beat the experts i'm just saying that
i did this time
i mean i would judge my own performance
as on that prediction as the only person
in the world who said it and the only
person who was right
is that too far
i literally saw no other person say what
i said
that the modern weapons would surprise
the russians
now i've got another question for you
is operating a drone
something that's so easy like driving a
car
that once you teach somebody to do it
well they're all about as good as any
other drone operator
what do you think
or do you think that there are some
drone operators who are like really
really good
like really really good and others
barely can keep the thing in the air
because that would be more common right
you would expect it to be a pretty big
range of how good somebody could be
second question if you accept that
there's probably a big range in talent
of drone operators
what are the odds the ukraine had one of
the good ones
who was actually in the ukrainian
military
and had that training
and that there were enough of those
trained experts
to operate all the new drones because
they'd never had this many drones do you
think ukraine had way more drone
operators
than they had drones
would that make sense
do you think that they would have three
drones
and
25
operators what do you think
no
[Laughter]
question three
is it possible to detect
who is operating a drone and from what
country
and what nationality they are
maybe i'm i mean that's the actual
actual question
can anybody know who's operating a drone
somebody says yes
all right let's say that we can know
who's operating it
let's say we can know that do you know
who's sitting in the chair
do you know what army they work for
let's say the best i'm just going to
give you a speculative possibility let's
say the best drone operators in the
world
were not ukrainians maybe they were
turkish because these are turkish
weapons right maybe the turks are the
best operators of those that equipment
could the turks
say
you know this drone operator he's in our
army but he's going to resign today
so he just here it is here's the paper
so our best drone operator he just
resigned so he's he's not in our army
but there are a lot of volunteers
signing up to work for ukraine
and if this guy decides to volunteer
well
that's on him and that's a ukraine he
can still sit in the seat
you know we'll let him sit in this chair
but he does not work for us
and these and these drones that he's
operating
we sold them these are not ukrainian
these are not turkish drones
is it possible
that nato is running the
drones maybe not on paper
but do you think that the ukrainians are
running the drones really
i feel like nato is already in the war
could be a problem
it's impossible to prove i would guess
because we would just you know deny it
and that would be the end of it
but
i don't see the ukrainians being the
drone operators i'm just saying
all right um
time is the main variable we'll see who
starves first the russian army
uh or the
people in kiev
and i think that's going to come down to
the the biggest thing
um
uh
and then here's another opinion that
i want to run by you
this from uh deadbeat
that's his twitter name deadbeat
he says imagine these various actions
taken to annoy the russian people
talking about the sanctions
are going to do anything but unify them
against the west what do you think do
you think the russians
the russian public
will side with putin because they'll
feel attacked by the whole world
or do you think that the russian public
will
want to get rid of putin
because he's this cause of all their
problems
it could go either way right
it's easy to imagine to go either way
but here's the way i would take it
i see the sanctions as a communication
tool
in addition to being sanctions but that
the russian public is probably finding
out for the first time
what the hell is going on and who their
leader is
so i think people in other countries may
have known who putin was in terms of you
know him doing something like this
and may have known what was happening in
ukraine
closer to the truth
but
i don't think the russian public knew it
and i think it would be one thing
so here i'm going to take aside
if one country let's say the united
states had put sanctions on russia what
would the russian public's view be
probably pro-putin
because that would feel like one country
attacking their country but what happens
if almost all the countries in the world
vote against you
and decide and decide to sanction what
if all the other countries even even
poor switzerland
what if you hear that basically
everybody except the worst countries in
the world
are against you
then do you say wait a minute the
problem is everybody in the world is
wrong
and putin is right
while you can't eat
would that be your thought would you
think oh that everybody in the whole
world they're all wrong
but my leader he's right so i'll back
him
i don't think so
i don't think so i think when you make
it everybody in the world and even china
barely has your back
i think the russian public catches on
so i would see the sanctions as a
communication tool and a way to frame
the situation
such that the russian public
is going to know what's happening one
way or the other
uh somebody says india china and africa
are on russia's side india isn't on
russia's side
i mean i don't know but
i don't think so
some of the
the uh the troll activity is just so
weak
so weak
there should be some kind of troll i was
just reading one of the troll comments
on there
here are the worst troll comments
because one of my cartoon characters is
called the pointy-haired boss and he's
dumb
the the dumbest criticism i ever get is
oh i guess scott is really the point
here boss
and i think to myself
did you really think nobody said that
after 33 years of me being in business
like you thought that would be a good
addition to the conversation
and now i just saw somebody in the
comments saying
scott wrote a book called loser think
and he didn't realize that his own
thinking was lewis earthling
seriously
you you can't troll better than that
soylent green
the matrix
what why don't you just do every npc
bumper sticker
fricken statement in the world
michael yeah i could do a micro lesson
on a troll better
if you could i don't want i don't want
to do that because somebody used it
against me
he's really cat bird
soil and green matrix
and the other one is a apologist
if you want to be the lowest level troll
call somebody else an apologist
just because they have a different
opinion
[Laughter]
that is such a low level of criticism
here's the other one that's a low level
of criticism should have happened sooner
as i often say
everything good should have happened
sooner
that's literally saying nothing yeah
yeah and and who is surprised and who
who didn't already think that the good
things should have happened sooner
that's nothing
uh
yeah
sycophant yeah all those words are just
npc words
maybe that's what we should call them
instead of trolls
oh yeah
oh this is good
here's what we're going to do
i think we should stop calling the
trolls because trolls is kind of cool
people buy troll dolls people watch
movies involve trolls attacking hobbits
trolls are kind of cool
right
kind of cool
but npcs
not cool
there are definitely people who call
themselves trolls all the time
they call themselves trolls in their own
profile i'm a troll
trolling since 1998 or whatever
but nobody calls themselves an npc
because an npc is like you really don't
matter
but these comments really don't matter
they're not useful or insightful they're
not even insulting they don't even do
what a troll is trying to do
even the troll is trying to at least get
a reaction
right but the npcs can't even do that
soylent green
silent green
all right
uh yes for those of you you don't know
npc means a non-player character
somebody in a video game who's not
central they're just background
background characters
uh
hey who is they having to just
stop that
i see your hypnosis sentences
uh an npc is seemingly a human that is
unable to think objectively
well i would say unable to do anything
but reiterate bumper sticker settings
so i would say that the npc is the
basically runs on a program of bumper
stickers they can only say what
uh
you know
depending on what side you're on they
can only say what you know rachel maddow
said or what hannity said or what
somebody else said
worse than watergate yes
npc
all right that's all i got for now i
think you'll agree that this is the best
live stream you have ever seen in the
entire world and the only thing that you
can say about it is i imagine even
tomorrow will be even better because it
probably will be
now
watch all of the news today
and see if you get a better take on the
ukraine situation
now again i want to be very careful and
say
i don't compare myself to the experts
but we do have an expert problem in this
country of them continuously being wrong
[Laughter]
i'm not making that up
can you back me
that the experts are having a terrible
year
i mean i'm not imagining that am i it
looks like they're having a bad year
now part of it is because we notice when
they're wrong right
when the experts do everything right we
don't notice
but i do think that they got more wrong
this time we all agree that the experts
are usually right usually right
but when there's a fog of war situation
i think it just all goes to hell
that's my take
that's a good comment on locals um
the comment i'll read it is that this
was an excellent show with a handsome
host
and
that's no npc there that's somebody
who's thought it through and on that
note
i'm going to sign off on youtube and
i'll see you tomorrow youtube
