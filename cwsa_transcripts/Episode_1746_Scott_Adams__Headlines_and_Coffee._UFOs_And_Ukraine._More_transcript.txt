pleasure
the
don't mean to the day thing makes
everything better it's called
simultaneously go
yeah that's better
um and monica
go take care of yourself
don't wait for this
um
so yeah the baby baby birds outside the
sound like screaming babies
is quite a big thing
and uh we're gonna talk about the news i
just started looking at it but uh
it's very newsy today
so
congress is holding a or did
a presentation about ufos which they
haven't done since the 60s
do you think
do you think ufos are real or just
something that's a
visual sighting but there's nothing real
there
what do you think how many say ufos are
real now real could be either
uh aliens or some other entity but are
they actually ships what do you think
i'm gonna say strong male
strong no
for me
and here's why
apparently adam schiff was involved in
this uh congressional ufo thing
yeah i was sort of leaning pro ufo until
i saw that adam schiff
might think they're real
and then i started thinking
i think this is a setup there's a little
foreshadowing going on here
because it's possible that russia will
be uh
let's say take it out of the 2024
election in america
because the war might just occupy them
who knows if putin will even be there
so they need a new russia
now the things you have going for it is
that you could blame them of bad stuff
and even when they said no we didn't do
it
you wouldn't believe them and you
couldn't check
you see where i'm going
blaming russia like the russian
collusion
hoax you could blame russia
and people would think yeah i should do
something like that
but they're denying it
but they lie
so maybe they did it's sort of the
perfect you know the entity to blame
there's only one better if russia isn't
available for the democrats to blame
ufos
yeah do you think that we're going to
have a ufos
affected the voting machines problem in
2024
okay not really but
it's funny to think about it
you put adam schiff on the ufo committee
and i start to think he's going to come
up with a ufo collusion hoax you know
what i mean
well
here's my argument
i don't care how many sensors
to see a ufo
i don't care how many eyewitnesses
if you can't get a clear picture
there's no ufo
now if your only picture is a smudge
there's no ufo
there's another one that's hilariously
uh
quite obviously some kind of a
fast forward button
on an interface that's just a perfect
triangle is lit up i'm looking at it and
i think
that's not a ufo that's clearly a
component from an american user
interface
it's just a triangle that's closing i
have i'm pretty sure i have glowing
triangles on several of my
devices
it's called
fast forward
yeah it seems like uh all these cameras
would get a better picture than the
smudge
and well most of the most the news is
about elon musk today he's like the new
trump in terms of drawing all of our
attention
so here are the some of the things that
elon musk did
just yesterday
right so this is just one day of elon
musk
uh he gave some kind of interview in a
podcast
and he said although he's voted
overwhelmingly for democrats mosquez
he slammed the democratic party in biden
in particular
and uh
he actually called the biden you know
basically he was saying the bible was
sort of
an empty suit
and he said quote the real president is
whoever controls the teleprompter
the tesla ceo has said
the path to power is the path to the
teleprompter
and he quote i do
accidentally lean on the teleprompter
it's going to be like anchorman you know
the movie anchorman
the ceo added referencing the 2004 film
and the ron burgundy movie
now
how awesome is that that yellow bus was
just dumping on the president
but he says he's you know he's voted
overwhelmingly democrat he is however
not republican
he wants you to know that he's a
moderate he's neither he's neither too
republican or too
democrat
and he also said that that might be the
perfect situation for buying twitter
because he's neither two left nor too
right
how many of you saw the
project veritas
the newest film of twitter employees
there's a brand new one yesterday
how many of you saw that
you know
i didn't think that project veritas
exactly how they've been on twitter
whether with their prior stuff the prior
stuff was good
and it definitely raised lots of
questions but but this one's just a
whole new level
now somebody who's seen it do a fact
check out me in the in the comments and
make sure that i'm
characterizing this correctly because
it's like it's simple and confusing at
the same time
um i believe that the employee who is
talking a twitter employee who's on the
hidden camera project veritas
said that they
they do
uh consciously
censor or suppress
uh the
the republican or the right
and he said that the reason that they do
that intentionally
is the following
if they don't suppress the right
the people on the left will complain
like crazy
it'll be a problem they'll leave the
platform
but if you suppress
wait yeah so if you press the suppress
the right the left will stay at the
platform
if you press the left
the left will leave the platform
so they're saying that the right can
take a punch
so that
their idea of fairness
is to
double
punish the people who are already
getting punished
is that right
and they're going to double punish the
people who are already punished or
something like that
like that it absolutely didn't make
sense because it all just boiled down to
we're biased against the right
but the the reasoning that they gave was
sort of a business reason that
doesn't feel too good when you try to
say it in your own mouth
you're like okay i sort of understood
that kind of not really
what
and you can tell that that muddy
thinking
is a real tell that they can't even
explain it in any way that
can be justified basically it's just
pure bias
so
that happened
now imagine imagine that happening
uh and twitter's right in the middle
of this acquisition
now
you may know that uh elect musk also
questioned the number of bots
now i think the ceo twitter refers to it
as spam
as opposed to so their bots and their
spam
and i don't know if those are exactly
the same
category
but in both cases they're things that
shouldn't be on the platform and if
advertisers are paying for the number of
users who are seeing their content
you have to subtract out
you know fake accounts
because those don't count
so i guess twitter is claiming five
percent or under five percent and
they've got a whole system and they
you know they remove a zillion accounts
a day
so they're working really hard to reduce
them and they say they've succeeded to
under five percent
elon has challenged them in public
by saying he thinks it's at least twenty
percent
now
what's happening
so twitter says five percent elon musk
was trying to buy the company
he says 20 percent
what's happening
they're negotiating
and elon musk is negotiating in public
now i saw some people
i'll get into a further story about this
some upstanding citizens of blue check
people saying that oh don't do this
you know don't be talking like this in
public
because he had an exchange with the
twitter ceo on twitter
and they felt it was like
sort of icky and seamless are not
seamless but
um it was just not a good look
to which i said
it's a really good rule
to not take your your business
your business laundry out and show it to
everybody right that's a good rule
so you can see where they're coming from
there is one exception
the one exception to the don't drag your
business laundry in front of everybody
would be what's the one exception
the one exception just one
one exception
if you can pull it off
that's it
you know i know you're going to say
if it's negotiating or if it's elon musk
those are good answers but i'm going to
say
the only time you should do that
is if you can pull it off
now how many people could pull that off
trump
right trump could pull it off
elon musk right he could pull it off but
they're not the only ones you know jeff
bezos could pull it off mark cuban could
pull it off you know there's a lot of
people
yeah jeff toobin can pull it off
i saw that comment
and so i'm completely in favor of this
because it is full transparency which is
exactly what musk said he was bringing
to twitter
why is it that you like if you do why is
it that you like musk buying twitter
transparency
that's that's what you want you just
want to find out what's in there what
are they doing to you
and the elon musk is taking his
transparency to the public putting it
right on twitter
to which i say
good job
that's exactly what i wanted i wanted to
see this in public
and the negotiation i think is solid
so here's where it gets fun
it's sort of the way he's negotiating
too that makes it
extra spicy
so the the twitter ceo i guess he felt
he needed to do a long thread explaining
why it is that they can't easily tell
you
how many
how many people are spam or
and so he goes through this long thread
i think there might have been
20 tweets
or something like that very long
very detailed and the essence of the
tweet was
that it takes a combination of external
information and proprietary internal
information
you have to put them together
and to find out how many bots and spam
you have
and unfortunately they'd love to show
people how they do it
but the internal stuff is proprietary
and they can't show you
so you can see some of the external
stuff but not the internal stuff so you
wouldn't really wouldn't really get that
determine
anything they can't show you either
what was elon musk's
comment
to a 20-thread tweet from the ceo of
twitter now remember twitter's the
company's buying
so he's also buying the ceo in a way
right if he stays there
i doubt he will
but if he does
uh he's buying the ceo and after that
ceo gives a
20 or so tweet thread
about all the complicated reasons that
they can't show you the data
elon musk retweets
a turd
a turd
that's it
now
could that be
more perfect
yes
yes it could
no that wasn't that wasn't the end
he retweets a turd to a 20 20
tweet thread of from the ceo of
twitter which every single person who
read it knew was
100 of everybody who read that said well
that's not true
i mean i'm no expert on technology but
even i know that's not true
and here's why elon followed up with his
turd
after the ceo
said we cannot show you for sure how we
know how many people are real followers
elon musk who is buying twitter
said this
if you if you don't if you can't confirm
how many i'm paraphrasing
if you can't confirm how many users you
really have
how do your advertisers know what
they're buying
[Music]
boom
i've nev i don't think i've ever seen a
ceo
dissected like that i mean he was just
disemboweled right in public
i mean uh
musk just slid him from you know
from uh neck to belly button and just
removed his bowels and threw it on the
internet
i've never seen anybody be destroyed
that hard
i i don't think he even answered
because
what exactly is the answer to that
nothing
there is no
 answer to that
if you can't tell the you the uh if you
can't
confirm to your cust to your advertisers
how many people are watching you don't
have a business
so apparently their business is based on
literally
now
what is all of this
what would you call all of that exchange
negotiating
it's negotiating
right he's just doing it in public and
he's doing it in a funny way
honestly it's just hilarious and do you
know why it's funny
because it's just true
and it's simple
do you know
do you know what is the trick to writing
a good comic strip or a good joke
well
there are a few elements you have to get
right to make a joke work
but the most basic part is
it has to be simple
it has to come across as true or true in
a funny way
and he does that
sort of reflexively so the reason the
reason that a lot of what most does is
funny
is because it's it's simple and true and
you don't expect either one
nobody expects simple and nobody expects
true
but if you give both of you it makes you
laugh because like ah that's simple and
true
so the turn the turn was just perfect
there's nothing else to say that was
better than that
all right
musk has also said that uh
you know he says the reality is that
twitter at this point has a very far
left bias
and that he said uh quote i would trust
myself as a moderate and either
republican or democrat so so he's
putting himself out there as a
having enough of a history of being on
both sides he said he loved obama
um not not loved him but he thought
obama was solid
and that
the biden is beholden to the uh
the
unions that feels about right doesn't it
he's definitely beholden to the school
unions without teacher shootings
so i think that sounds about right
again that that would be elon musk
saying something that's both simple and
true
that biden is just
beholden to the unions and so therefore
he's not effective
that's it
um
all right
now here's here's the part where i
always tell you
have i ever mentioned that i get dragged
into the headlines a lot
i've told you that right
in the weirdest possible ways i'm just
minding my own business next thing i'm
in some kind of
i'm in some kind of story national story
i'm like
or i'll i'll be reading a article about
the news and suddenly it'll be about me
it's the weirdest damn thing
well this whole story i told you about
elon musk tweeting at the ceo of twitter
somebody printed a dilbert comic in the
middle of that exchange
it was a dilbert comic in which dilbert
was telling his boss roughly speaking if
i can paraphrase my myself
dilbert was saying that
the data
is all useless because he can tweak the
data with small changes of assumptions
and it completely changes the results
so since the data is completely
dependent on its assumptions which are
just guesses
the data can't be used for anything and
it's worthless
and the boss replies
don't mention any of that stuff when you
show it to the board
now elon actually
responded to that with a
with a laughing happy face
so suddenly i'm in the middle of that
and then somebody else printed a
dilbert comic from a photograph of elon
musk's office i guess he had a dil
reconnect on the wall
so suddenly
oh something there's there's the actual
comics somebody's putting on the locals
over on locals you can paste uh images
into the uh comments
and i gotta tell you the comments are
way more interesting because they got
memes and
when i talk about some something
somebody will show everybody else so as
i'm talking it's like they're seeing a
slideshow from the other users of what
it is i'm talking about it's a much
better experience
that's a subscription subscription
service called locals
you can find me there
all right
let's talk about something else
so there he is i just tweeted before i
got on uh i think david boxnorton saw
this on twitter
and there's a translated speech of a
russian general i believe
on some kind of a news program in russia
who is
uh giving the russian public a dose of
truth
that i don't think anybody was ready for
and you have to you have to watch the
whole thing it's worth it
almost everything he says
is jaw-dropping
because he's just giving the russian
people
a military truth that they've never
heard before and among the things he
says
are that
the
that the ukrainians are about to um
get a massive amount of weapons
and that they will have one million
armed
fighters in ukraine
fairly soon
now how do i assume means in this
context
but uh this
this general clearly thought
that soon was soon enough
meaning that the war would still be
going on and those million people would
be armed
now the pushback is well these are
you know volunteers and
they'd be like conscripts
so they wouldn't be very effective or
they wouldn't be very professional and
here's the thing that just blew my mind
the general said there basically he said
they're fighting for their home country
that's as professional as you can get
basically
i have something on my mouth
i don't i can't tell if that was a
comment about my content or my actual
look
um
so his statement is
that the ukrainians are about to get
massive amount of weapons and it's
guaranteed because it's already in
process
and that modern weaponry will hit these
ukrainians who are fighting for their
homeland and basically this russian is
telling the he's telling the russian
public
that ukraine is going to win this thing
now he didn't say that
exactly but he said
he basically said ukraine is going to
win
and he said there's you can't beat them
because they're going to be armed to the
teeth there's going to be a million of
them and they're fighting for their
homeland and you can't beat that
basically
you have to hear it is jaw-dropping
now
i don't know if that guy would be alive
tomorrow
because he was so honest about what's
going on there
i don't know i don't know how he can
survive that honestly i mean i think
he'll be in jail by tomorrow
um but at the same time cnn is and i
think fox news too is reporting that the
ukrainians are moving out of mariopol
they're they're surrendering there and
their steel plant the ones who are
trapped there are in bad shape
so it does look like russia is making
some
you know mopping up their victory there
and they're shelling in the west
so if you were to read the headlines
today
it would look like russia is winning
just based on the very little stuff that
we're hearing it looks like russia's
winning then you hear this russian
general on russian tv
saying
there's no way we can beat that
basically there's no way we can beat
them
it's just amazing
um
so who knows if that's true
so i looked at what uh
fox is covering versus what cnn is
covering
and every now and then the news will be
similar
have you noticed that
news will be similar on cnn and not fox
news not today
it's like there are two different worlds
that are being reported on
over on cnn the only things that matter
are the buffalo mass shooting
huh why is that so important
oh could it be because it's a white
supremacist
and that fits into their republicans or
white supremacist narrative yes that's
why
so i think the top uh
10 stories are all about the buffalo
shooting how many of the top 10 stories
on fox news were about the buffalo
shooting
i don't think any
so there's an entirely different news
world on cnn today completely different
fox news has the ufo story
and the rest of cnn is about abortion
law
so the two topics
that would be best for democrats to win
elections would be the mass shooting
because they don't have much they don't
have accomplishments to work on so they
have to work on republican problems
right they have no accomplishments
they have to focus on criticizing
republicans
now has there ever been a sitting
administration this will blow your mind
by the way
here's another thought that i would
expect to be on the mainstream media
pretty soon
uh have you ever seen an incumbent
running for office without talking about
accomplishments
and only talking about how the other
team is bad and you better elect us so
that you don't get that bad stuff
and the argument is
you we elected you and we still
got a white supremacist blowing up a
grocery store with with guns
right
isn't the argument for the incumbent
i've done a good job look at my
accomplishments wouldn't you like more
of these
that's how it's supposed to work right
and then the one who's challenging
doesn't have any accomplishments so the
challenger has to simply criticize
that's always the way it is right i'm
not wrong about that
you should have the the challenger
should be a criticizer
the incumbent should be a accomplishment
person
but because biden has no accomplishments
cnn is trying to give them a boost
by talking only about the shooting which
they would say is a gun control problem
so they would that's their narrative
against the republicans and the abortion
law thing which is just another
narrative against the republicans
both of these are
failures aren't they
because the democrats wanted to keep
abortion the way it was but it's not
so that's a democrat failure even though
there's nothing they could do about it
because they don't have the majority but
it's a failure in terms of policy
and then the the shooting
happened you know a year into um biden's
administration and i don't believe there
are any laws that he's passed that would
have changed it am i right
did bai didn't do anything that that
unless they didn't even attempt anything
that if he had succeeded would have
stopped this shooting
nothing right
so i why are they blaming this on the
republicans when they have control of
everything they didn't do a damn thing
so this is the weakest
the weakest
administration i've ever seen by far i
think i mean certainly in my life it's
the weakest administration where if you
can literally have the richest man in
the world
say i think whoever runs the
teleprompter is in charge
and even his own side will say yeah
that's not that's not too far
even if you disagree with that statement
that whoever runs the teleprompter
controls the country right now even if
you disagree
you do not save yourself
that's taking it too far
right
the most you can disagree with that is a
little bit
that's it that's all that's left
all right and i guess uh
i saw in the five yesterday that
the nbc poll has um
historical point it's one of the worst
one of the worst approval ratings for
president of all time i guess
um
they ended energy independence yeah they
did some things
they did some things
all right
uh the fbi is 0 and 20 on stopping
actual terrorists
well i do wonder why we have not had
more foreign terrorists on our soil in a
long time
does anybody understand that
how do you explain that
seriously
how is it that
with all the people and all the access
to the country and all the technology
and all the
you know the size of things that you
need to bring in
to be bad is you know small
right i mean 911 happened with box
cutters right
so
it's not like they have to smuggle
anything in and it's easy to get people
in again so
why why are we not seeing terrorist acts
like crazy
is it because the terrorists
don't want to do it
because they think we'll be too tough on
them back in their home country or
something
is that why
or
or are we so good at monitoring
communication that we find them all
i feel like it's that second one
because it seems like there would always
be something you wanted
and have the means
to do a terrorist attack
you know you don't really run out of
people who want to do it
do you i don't think so
i feel as though we must be able to
catch them all and the only way that's
possible is if we're monitoring all
communications basically everywhere
um with our foreign entities my foreign
partners
and that our ai
can catch everybody
let me say that again
i don't believe
it would be any possibility
that we would be so terrorism free
relatively speaking from from foreign
terrorists the domestic ones we still
have for some reason
no not for some reason but let's be
honest the reason that this shot
up a buffalo store
is that
is that the authorities decided not to
do anything about it
because he had been reported
as a danger
now correct me if i'm wrong
but this is yet again another case where
people had all the warning in the world
but they couldn't do anything about it
because he was mentally ill
so here's why we can stop a foreign
terrorist
because there's nothing to stop us from
stopping
there's no law that says no don't stop
that foreign terrorist
but what happens if it's domestic
terrorist
we actually have laws
that won't let you do anything about it
because they're going to say well it's
free speech
legal gun governorship
and uh we don't put mentally ill people
uh
in any kind of
institution against their will
if it were a
foreign person who also happened to be
mentally ill
we would lock him up right away am i
right
if it were a foreign terrorist they
would just get locked up or killed right
away
the domestic ones can slip through
not because they're undetected
they slip through
detect it
detect it
so this is telling me the following
that our a.i
and our digital
surveillance of basically everything
must be so good
that the ai can catch 100 of foreign
terrorists
it's got to be true
no it's not
less too far it doesn't have to be true
i'm saying that i can't think of another
explanation but remember
i'm also an author of a book
in which i warn you just because you
can't think of another explanation
that has nothing to do
with whether there's another explanation
it has everything to do with your
inability to imagine other things
so if you can't imagine any other
possibility it might be a problem with
your imagination
that's the ufo thing
the reason that i'm i'm not a believer
in these ufos
is because the argument is we can't
imagine what else they would be
that's the argument
it's not that we've confirmed it
we simply have a failure of imagination
to imagine what it could be given our
observation
it's just a failure of imagination
so when i say when i see a ufo story i
don't see ufos i go oh there's a bunch
of people who have an imagination
failure
right
because if for a ufo problem we'd have a
freaking photograph by now
it wouldn't look like a smudge
it'd look like a damn
ufo
by now
right
now what did i do
i just did it again
i just basically told you i couldn't
imagine
a situation where there wouldn't be a
clear photo by now
but could there be a situation
in which there would not be a clear
photo and yet there could be real ufos
yes
and that situation could be the ufos
don't want to be seen
so they either move fast or they move at
night or they or they have some
technology that makes it difficult or
whatever
so sure
yeah if you use your imagination if you
accept that they're alien visitors with
high tech
then anything's in play
all right oh they're high-tech and
baffle your cameras
so i guess anything's possible
um
could be hidden from us you never know
it's the romulans
i think it's the romulans
so how many of you have been convinced
maybe either
from something i said or something
somebody else said
that we do
let's say i'm going to say
you're at least open to the possibility
so you don't have to have decided
how many of are open to the possibility
that this reality is actually a
simulation created by another
civilization
how many are open to it as of today
over on locals
yes yes yes
open open open open
unbelievable i would not have imagined
that
oh my goodness
um i'm doing i'm seeing those
on the
yeah we're definitely seeing those
amazing
the vast majority of you are actually
open to the possibility may i compliment
you
may i compliment you that is exactly
intellectually where you should be
because the the trouble with the theory
or the advantage of it is that you can't
really rule it out easily
it's based on statistics
and the argument is so simple
that everybody can understand the
argument
so if you have an appreciation for
statistics that's all you need
if if you're aware of the fact that ten
to one is more likely than
two to one
that's all you need doesn't it doesn't
require any other physical understanding
of anything
uh no blood in a sim
i don't know
you said uh
so neil uh
was it
degrassi
you ruled it out you can't rule it out
that's not a thing
all right um
so
statistics may be shaped by the
simulation
it could be that math and statistics are
the only things you can't tweak within
the simulation but i suppose you could i
mean you could make it seem like the
odds of things are different than they
are that's just software
he has an explanation that makes it
unlikely
no he doesn't i mean i'm sure he i
believe you when you say you said that
but i do not believe that if you read a
counter to this the simulation theory
that it would look like anything but
word salad
i think it would look like word salad
but that's why i want to say it so send
it to me
all right
um
simulation theory isn't useful because
it's not a falsifiable
let me deal with that
if we are a simulation
would it be useful to know it
um
it could be there's no way to know but
it could be and here's why
i'm trying to understand why
affirmations
seem to work
i'm trying to understand why
i seem to have the ability to move the
entire planet
because i can't tell you everything i've
ever done
but i have moved the whole planet a
number of times
and some of them you saw but mostly
haven't
and
i can't understand that
you know am i
one in a billion people who have some
ability to
make crazy things happen in reality
i don't
care rule it down but it seems unlikely
a million one
so
i can't explain it unless the simulation
allows you to steer
your reality within the game
look at the people who believe in the
simulation
not the people who are open to it and
talk about the people who buy into i buy
into it
right
it is my reality for all practical
purposes meaning that i see it i
perceive it i live it like it's a
simulation
here's one of the things that i can do
in a simulation
that i can't do in the real world
change the real world
change something big in politics
but you've seen me do it a number of
times if you're paying attention you've
seen it
uh
and just trust me that the big stuff
i can never tell you now
but there are far bigger things that
i've been involved with that you could
ever imagine
uh well maybe you can mention
but i can't explain it now let's take
somebody who's not me
let's take elon musk because he's the
the example of everything it turns out
uh elon musk
apparently believes the simulation
that's that's what he tells us
and somebody's asking then why did you
mail it marriage fail
did it
let me ask you this
i'm writing a book on reframing
so i tend to see things in reframes now
and just tuned my mind to that
if it if you have a marriage and it
lasts several years
and it was good
it was good enough that you stayed in
several years and have you know tons of
good things happen
and then it ends is that a failure
suppose you started the company and it
operated for 100 years
and then it went out of business
is the company of failure
suppose you had a child
a child grew up had a career
raised kids
but then
the child got old became a senior
citizen and when the child is 90 years
old the child dies
no longer a child
is that
is that life a loss
i mean in the sense was it a failure
no i mean it was successful until it
wasn't
so
you know having had two marriages
in my background now
i can tell you that both of them were
amazing
while they were happening
they were amazing while they were
happening
but then things change
situation changes for whatever reason
who knows things change
and then it doesn't work
and then when doesn't something doesn't
work
what are you supposed to do about it
are you supposed to just stay with it
yeah just just because you don't want to
lose
or quit don't want to fail
no
life is about change
life is about change continuous change
so when things when things change you
adjust
and it's painful
because almost all change has some pain
with it right there's friction
so if you're saying to yourself scott
did the end of your either marriage
either one of them
was as sad
i would say well
i'm not even sure yes i mean yeah you
have bad emotions associated you're
angry you're sad whatever you are and
that's
temporary and then something else
happens
right
so i don't feel as if
these are past failed courses
life is not pass fail
life is managing change
so the question you should have asked is
scott
how well did you manage the change
that might be i think i might have to
make that a chapter in my book
how well did i manage the change
and the answer is pretty well
pretty well
i mean i'm intact
i feel like
all my all my limbs are here
you know i still have my job
i'm in good shape i'm literally in good
shape i'm actually
physically fit
more than any time in my life as i'm
yeah i'm pretty approaching
what's today
like three weeks or so i'll be 65.
and i'm literally the fittest i've ever
been
at least visually yeah i can't run as
far as public
but
i don't know
i'm not really suffering
[Music]
does it look like i'm suffering
so when you say to be scupped you did
not succeed in maintaining your marriage
i say
i'm not sure that that was the right
um frame
the frame should have been how did you
manage um
let me just say something some of you
won't recognize this story
but there's a factoid i'd like to drop
into the conversation for the few of you
who do
there's something that happened with a
cult later
that what you don't know
he basically messaged christina at some
point
and she responded with a kissy face
which she showed me by the way it wasn't
a secret do you know how many times
christina has responded with a kissy
face
to a man who flirted with her online
just just guess how many times that's
happened
just go to her go to her feed and look
at her feet it's the primary response
she does
i've seen her give a kissy face response
to a man flirting with her
a thousand times
maybe that's i don't think that's an
exaggeration i think i've seen him do it
a thousand times
now the
this guy tate who's a some kind of weird
weirdo
he's decided that that means he stole my
wife
are two things that he is unaware of
number one
it's a generic response
number two
it was six months after our relationship
had ended
it's just that i wasn't talking about it
in public so he thought it happened
during the relationship but it was it
was well after the
well after she and i had
were beyond beyond saving the marriage
so it wasn't anything that bothered me
so in other words had she responded any
way she wanted it would have been fine
with me because at that time anything
was
was fair again
all right so i'll just put that out
there
can you not ask me about that anymore
uh
yeah no no more hypothetical questions
no more no more of that
that's all we need to say about that all
right
is there any other news that i'm missing
uh
why did you like her posting sexy
pictures
what are you basing that on
when when did you say
when did you hear me say i liked it
why would you even make that assumption
now my take is that if that's who she
was when i met her
you know it wasn't really up to me to
change it it was either up to me to be
okay with it
or to
or to move on i guess
um
what is this neil degrassi is back to
believing in the simulation after he
recently interviewed nick bostrom
okay so that explains it
so i couldn't quite understand why neil
degrassi
tyson who
clearly is smart enough to be a
physicist
how he could not understand the argument
enough to at least think it's possible
but i guess he talked to the father of
the argument nick bostrom
and
now he's open to it it sounds like if
based on the comment i saw on locals
just now
uh the crying birds are still there i've
got one window closed here that's
closest to me so you don't hear them as
well
can you believe that maui weed is not
legal
except if you have a prescription from
hawaii
of all places
of all places hawaii
is probably the most marijuana smoking
place on earth
and that's not legal recreation
it's weird
um
all right
yeah i saw tucker referred to
uh was it uh who was it he was talking
to about crawford
he called them eyepatch mccomb or no
eyepatch mccain
high patch mccain
i do not endorse that
nickname
so let me give you a uh
let me give you a
little tip
making fun of a
veteran's disability
no matter how clever
it doesn't really fly very well
i didn't love it
it was
it was deliciously provocative
um which he intended it to be
but uh i'm not i'm not on that train
so i'm not with tucker on that
i i didn't say it's not funny
you know let me be clear
i can appreciate the humor of it it's
very clever
it's dismissive and everything so it's
everything he wants it to be and and
he's referring to another
uh wounded veteran right
so
i'm not sure if that's why he's
referring to it is
israel is he referring to him as i patch
mccain
because of his politics or is it also
because he's a wounded veteran
and that gives him some extra extra
juice
this is slap worthy
um
i think the assault on tucker is going
to get really really hard between now
and 2024 what do you think
is it my imagination or does tucker seem
like
uh
he's like the
i don't know what
how would you describe it now because
his role is very
important
to the ecosystem on the right
so would you say he's like that the 10th
pole
um
conservative does he even call him by
the way does tucker call himself a
conservative or is he independent i
think he's independent right
but since his his audience is
right-leaning conservative
um
he's a foil somebody says
national treasure
right well it could be all those things
you know tucker is a complicated guy
um
yeah i think tucker is going to be on
the serious assault
and if it's played the way it's usually
played they will make up
something that he didn't say
and treat it as though he said
and that would that's the way
the left attacks most things right
the primary leftist attack
is to literally make up something that
almost happened but didn't you know
something you could convince people
happened but didn't really happen
and that that's your whole attack
so they're going to look so tucker is
going to be the
painted as the the white supremacist you
know grand
kegel or whatever
and they're going to try to go after
that but the one thing that tucker has
consistently done
let's say correct
from a strategic and career
perspective
he's always laughed off criticism and
he's never shied away from him so he
doesn't apologize it doesn't back up
i mean i he may have apologized for
something but it was of his own doing i
think i don't think he's ever been
forced to apologize for anything
and i think because his audience just
goes up
no matter how hard he is attacked
that he's created a good situation so
he's he's as close to uncancelable as
you can get
but he's not
right he's as uncancelable as maybe
hannity in the sense that
you know he's a he's a big profit
source for the network
and he's so popular that it would just
cause a you know
can you imagine if either of those two
got cancelled in some way
now again i'm not saying that i agree
with their uh opinions or politics
that's a completely different subject
but if if the two tenth holes
of conservative thought
at least popular conservative thought
um
you know if they got canceled in some
way that'd be a pretty big deal
all right
um more democrats watch tucker than
anyone else is that true
what happened to the matt gates scandal
well
let's go back to that matt gates
so-called scandal
were you expecting by now that he would
be
indicted
that didn't happen did it
were you expecting by now that um the
evidence would show he was
guilty of something horrible
didn't happen did it
were you expecting by now that you would
hear the name of an accuser or at least
that to be a specific person with a
specific description maybe not the name
yeah if if said person were
under 18
so where's all that story
where is it
do you think that that was ever real
if you're not hearing about it today
how real could it have been
yeah
um
oh somebody says he's super nice you
chatted with him
[Music]
young democrats dig him you said
all right
you were blazing to write in maui now
you know here's the weirdest thing the
whole time i've been here i've had brain
fog
and not for the reasons that you might
think
um i can't sleep enough here i don't
know why
i haven't been able to i mean i wrote 40
pages and i got a good start on the book
but
uh
i fall asleep writing every
10 or 15 minutes
unless i've got lots of stimulation
around me so the only place i could
write
is at a meal so i just take my laptop
and have lots of people
around me making noise and stuff so i
can't fall asleep
and then i can ignore them real easily
and right
so i love to have people to ignore
to write it's my ideal situation
i want lots of people
but i want to be able to ignore them
because that's how i can stay awake
okay
all right um
you don't like sleep anyway i hate sleep
last night was just
i'll tell you last night
if you put a camera on me trying to
sleep
and this is after
i don't know
i probably walked 12 miles on the beach
i did everything you could do
to be ready for sleep
and you know my bed is like a mess i was
probably up
five times last night
um
i was too hot i was uncomfortable i was
itchy
just everything i just hate to sleep i
hate to sleep
it's not your plugs it's not about noise
um tribanural beats
i have tried binaural beats and i
you know i don't know too much about
them but i can tell you that when i put
them on with headphones it's a certain
kind of
beat that's supposed to have a mental
effect on you it does feel like
something's happened
if you have anybody ever tried the
binaural beats
i don't know what it's doing
but as soon as you put them on it's not
like regular noise
if it feels like something's happened to
your brain
um they'll say do you know if
suno still believes in the simulation
well i i don't know if he ever believed
it i'm not
i'm not aware that he believed it
but i'm not aware that he ruled it out
so if i had to guess
if i had to guess he probably puts it in
the category of things that could be
could be one interpretation of the
universe
i think he prefers others though i think
he prefers more of a christian
narrative is that true
i can't speak for him so you know i'm
not
i spend much less
time
wondering about his religious journey
than i do about his other opinions
because the religious journey is
a little bit more about himself
and it's sort of an
individual thing even though he shares
it with everybody which i always
appreciate
all right
um
[Music]
in fast company we're not living in the
simulation probably who said that in in
18
master back in detroit auto plants oh no
um
moon over maui right now
you watching netflix to put you to sleep
um
what's musk going to say next or
prediction well who can predict
what could be harder than trying to
predict
that
all right um i believe just before i
signed on here i saw a
rasmussen
tweet so i think there's a new rasmussen
poll to see what they got going on here
two-thirds of voters favor limits on
abortion
this harassment says more voters
describe themselves as pro-choice
than pro-life but they do support state
laws that limit held late
so i guess that line between pro-choice
and
and pro-life is sort of murky because
people have different different ideas of
where to draw that line
okay i guess we knew that the latest uh
rasmussen blah blah blah survey
says 67 percent of likely u.s voters
believe abortion should not be legal
past the first three months so
two-thirds of people
are in favor of at least not having to
pass the first three months
that includes 24 who think all abortions
should be illegal
24
i'm not even going to say anything about
that because this is
too provocative
to provoke
let's just say
you see the third rail
here's that third rail
here's me
i see you
i'm not gonna get near you
[Music]
there was a time
when i would have gone to the next level
on this conversation
and been cancelled immediately by my
audience for good reason
another 13 say abortion should be legal
up to the first six months of pregnancy
thirteen percent
should be legal up to the first
well
wow
but see the trouble is with these polls
i believe people are adding their own
assumptions
don't you
because i think that the 13 percent who
say should be legal up to the first six
months
are almost certainly saying only under
the condition of
i don't believe there's it'd be hard to
find anybody
who thinks you should abort a
six-month-old baby
for anything except a health emergency
for the mother
am i right
so i believe the context is if you have
to choose between the life of the mother
and the life of the unborn but
definitely a baby by six months if you
had to choose
then
this number of people would say that the
mother should be able to choose her own
self-interest
and that has a little less to do with
abortion
and more to do with who gets to decide
who lives and dies
so that's a slightly different question
in that case
and so one of my macro takes on abortion
is that we're never talking about the
same thing even when we think we are
somebody says killing the baby is not
necessary well i would think that would
be true in almost every case
but you cannot imagine any case
can you not imagine any case where there
would be a choice between which one
lives or dies
because i think there's there must be
some rare cases where that's true and i
think that these people are talking
about the rare case
somebody says never
you know with modern technology maybe it
is never
because a six month old you could
you could pull out pretty pretty quickly
right
with necessary
somebody says very rare
yeah
okay all right well i don't know enough
about the medical part of that to have a
good opinion on
i asked yesterday because
one of my biggest problems in life right
now
is that there's a belief
that i was pro-vaccination and pro-mats
those of you who watch me know that i
simply talked about
the arguments on both sides
but i was never a pro mask mandate
and never pro vaccine mandate
but so i asked how many people thought i
was
pro-vax or pro
mask
and there's a lot of people
so a lot of people have the impression
that i was exactly the opposite of my
opinion
and i couldn't figure out why and there
there seems to be one tweet
that
was misinterpreted
now you could argue
that that's my fault
which is a separate situation
but the tweet was that after i got
vaccinated
i said that um
to a paraphrasing now but i think i said
um
if you're unvaccinated you're in a
pandemic
and if you're vaccinated it's just
tuesday
and people said well that is telling me
that you were pushing the vaccinations
and i can see why they say that
can you
i can see why you might interpret it
that way
because i was saying that
it's the difference between feeling like
you're in a pandemic and feeling like
you're not
just does that to you
feel as though it is promoting
vaccinations
go
would you say that that statement
that the way you feel after you get
vaccinated you feel you're outside of
the pandemic
does that
does that promote vaccinations
i think i saw the the answer i would
have said which is kinda
kinda you can interpret it that way
so i'm gonna put that on me
all right so
clearly this is a problem i brought on
myself here's what i intended
right so i'm gonna tell you what i
intended
and then you can see how i missed
the intention was to tell you how i felt
is that telling you what to feel
do you interpret it that way if i say i
like this ice cream am i telling you
that you'll like it
i mean you might that's not what i'm
telling you i just tell you i like it
if i say i like bicycles
am i promoting them
kinda
kinda but it's not what's in my mind
right yeah my intention is not to
promote them
my intention is just saying i like
bicycles
that's it i like bicycles
so i can definitely see you know
somebody took it too far but let me
further explain
what i meant when i said
uh you have to remember the context of
when when i said it
so is when masked mandates were dropping
the first time before they came back
and it was when if you were vaccinated
you were a free person
if you were vaccinated you could go to
restaurants and you could travel
so my comment
that if you're vaccinated you don't feel
like you're in a pandemic
it was literally true
because once vaccinated i could travel
i could go to restaurants yeah i'm gonna
have to show the little card but that's
one second of my time
so the feeling of getting vaccinated
was the feeling of being done with the
pandemic now it turns out it ramped up
and it got worse
but at the time
that's how i felt
now
is that telling you to get vaccinated
i'm telling you that i got a card so i
can travel
you agree with that
right you all agree
that people were vaccinated gained more
freedom
i mean they took a risk to get it right
there's always a risk with everything
but they gained more freedom than other
people so for me the pandemic was over
i didn't realize it was going to get
worse and then i'd be right back into it
but at the time it felt like well it's
over
yeah you guys have a problem
now part of that also
was that the the
science seemed to indicate
that if you didn't drop dead fairly soon
from the vaccination and i didn't
um
that you probably were way better off
and that your risk of dying from covet
would go from really small you know
something under i don't know one or two
percent
to basically forget about even thinking
about it
so
i do worry about a two percent risk of
dying
two percent's enough you know with with
my age and asthma etc
uh it's hard to estimate anybody's
individual risk but i figure
two percent
you know maybe on the high side two
percent one percent on the high side
but a one one or two percent chance of
death is a lot
i would avoid all two percent chances of
dying
would you
if you get in your car to drive to the
store it's not a two percent chance of
dying
it's way less
it's just that you drive a lot right and
other people do too
um
is there anything else i do that has a
two percent chance of dying
can you can you think of anything
is there any normal thing i do
that would get me anywhere in the
neighborhood of 2 chance of dying
because i did it
i can't think of anything i do
road rage
yeah
so anyway the point of that was how i
personally felt and then people um
interpreted that as being some kind of
recommendation which it clearly was not
now the context that other people didn't
know is how many times i've said um i'm
not going to make a medical
recommendation
and how many times i said every
individual is different you just need to
make up your own mind if you do that
then you would have seen my tweet as
just talking about how i felt at the
moment you know my freedom had been
returned
before it was taken away again but it
was returned momentarily
um
even mild coved creates
long-term risk well we don't know
scott's cardio is back battling what's
that mean
uh you stated you're not a doctor that's
correct
[Music]
uh
prisoner island can every challenge be
overcome
no
but most challenges can be overcome if
you're willing to pay the price
it's just the price might be too high
buying pot might be laced with something
dangerous do you think i have a two
percent chance of dying every time i
smoke pot
i don't know i don't think there would
be a lot of pot smoking if that were the
case
you probably just looked for persuasion
and then you saw yeah yeah that's why
i'm taking responsibility for that
because i am a professional communicator
and if i professionally communicate
poorly and i would say that's
definitely an example of that
but here's here's my blind spot
my blind spot was thinking that people
knew the context
and that was ridiculous
because not everybody would know the
context
um
at foreign yen
any thoughts on bill gates back peddling
did he backpedal on the
vaccinations
or what
um
going to war with china yeah okay that's
risky
um he said coven was an old person's
disease well that everybody always said
that
neo says that scott adams was very smug
about being fully vaccinated now he's
backpedaling nope i was never smoke
about it
that never happened neo
you
so i'm going to be smoke about you
we'll hide you on that channel
so that
that would be a case of
you
having an interpretation let me tell you
what i was smug about
i was definitely smug
but i was smug about the
the thought process
i was never smug that
uh getting the vaccination would 100 be
the best situation for me and not kill
me by accident
i was never
unaware
and i never underplayed
that a vaccination that was
let's say
speedily developed
would be as safe as one that you had a
lot of information about
i was i was always clear about that
so how could you be smug about a guess
i told you a hundred times
that i didn't know if getting the
vaccination was a good decision or not
and i put it off as long as possible so
there'd be as much information as
possible of other people taking it
so and if there was if there had been a
way to avoid it entirely
and still be able to fly
i would have done it
does that sound smug
as i
talk to you now i'll tell you what was
smug
when i debunked your bad arguments
because a lot of people were on my side
in essence
but i had bad arguments to get there and
i couldn't handle that
so i was definitely smug about let me
tell you let me give you the
mask argument i'm smug that i'm 100
right about masks and always have been
completely completely sure
because
it's based on logic
and plume theory
and i doubt there's anybody who could
argue against it now if you saw a live
stream
in which i asked how many people
watching the live stream at the moment
were engineers
and i said all right let me just talk to
the engineers and watch me convince them
that masks work
and right in front of you i convinced
every engineer who was watching the
masks work a little bit
you want me to do it again
we know that the more virus you're
exposed to in the beginning matters
and we know that the masks don't work
because they distribute the virus
in many ways and they don't stop it
but that
distribution
guarantees
that the person that you're standing
right in front of is not getting a full
dose
of virus as much as it could be
now no engineer is going to argue with
what i just said
because they know you can't blow out a
candle with a mask on
you could try but the air is going to
come out the side that's all it needs to
do
if all it does is come out the sides
you're reducing the amount of virus that
you're
shooting into somebody's face
and in those cases but not in the case
where everybody's just sitting in the
same room for eight hours
if everybody's just sitting in the same
room for eight hours well maybe the room
is just so full of virus by then it
doesn't make much difference
but for general you know communication
and
our relationships if you could remove
the fire hose of virus directly into my
face
even if i get it
even if i get infected i should have
much less of a illness or death
now i just convinced 100 of you
that was always the argument i was
always the argument there's not a single
person who could argue with what i just
said
right
did the comments just went silent
everybody in the in the
every single one of you just said oh
that's actually a pretty good argument
every one of you
every single one of you just agreed with
me
so can i be smug
i just i just convinced every one of you
i think i deserve to be smug
don't i
give you
if you had done that i would give you
credit
right if i watched you do what i just
did
i would definitely give you credit for
it i'd say jesus that was pretty good
you know okay you won you win i'm
convinced
now the only people who are going to
push back are going to say stuff like
no
or lol
but nobody in the comments is going to
give a like a one sentence pushback
where oh scott you're forgetting this
part of physics or something like that
nothing
because the argument is completely
airtight
there's nothing you can say about it now
i will say let me say this as clearly as
possible
i don't think you saw the effect of
masks in the larger statistics
everybody okay with that
that as far as i know i haven't seen the
difference so that's why i was not in
favor of mass mandates
because while i believe there's a
hundred percent chance they make a
difference in some situations 100 chance
there doesn't seem to be enough of a
difference
overall
that i would make all the citizens wear
masks
so i separate the mandate which seems
ridiculous because it just doesn't show
up in the statistics
with the fact that the physics is
physics and engineering is engineering
you can't get away from that
all right
so
i try to limit my smugness to situations
where nobody would disagree if they hurt
my argument
i'm sure i don't do that but i tried to
that
like i that's the only time that i'm
going to be completely smug
is when i know you will agree with me
you will agree with me every one of you
agrees with me right now and if you say
you know you're live
or you're lying to yourself
every one of you agrees with what i just
said
all right
um
you don't believe they're just i don't
know what that's about
i always wondered if wearing a mask
could be negative
i would guess that for some people the
mask is negative
how many times has somebody accidentally
picked up the wrong mask
and it was a mask of an infected person
but just think about it
just just imagine in your mind
how many times
your family like used a mask and then
you were going to use it again
and you saw a mask
have you ever been in your car
and you forgot to bring a fresh mask
and there is one in the car from a
family member that just used it
you ever pick up that mask that your
family member used
and put it on because it's your only
mask you forgot to bring one yes you
have
yes you have
so in a hundred different ways can you
imagine that a mask would make things
worse
yes i can
yes
that's not the only example i'll bet i
could come up with all kinds of ways
that wearing mask makes it worse in some
cases
in some cases so that's why i disagree
with the mandate
because it's not showing up in the
numbers that it matters
but i i can't get past engineering and
physics
why did we not see one particle
physicist talking about masks or what
you know even when i saw the experts
talking about the mass they never were
smart about it
i don't believe i saw
one expert say what i said to you today
had they said that everybody would have
agreed on masks
think about that
if if the experts had described it to
you the way i just did
about just reducing the plumes
everybody would have said oh shoot i
guess they do work in some situations
but i don't want them to wear them or
where it's not enough of a
difference but it would have completely
changed how you felt about it
you still wouldn't want to do it
but at least you'd say okay i get the
argument the argument makes sense
all right
um it has good drywall or if they work
well everybody who's making the argument
that viruses penetrate masks is making
the wrong argument
because nobody disagrees with that
and that was never the point
um
god
i never want to talk about masks again
how do you miss a bullet a few microns
wide
yeah my top two you're right
people don't understand friction they
don't understand
cost benefit analysis they don't
understand systems versus goals
those are three things that i hope
all right
uh
any new micro lessons coming up yes but
i'm gonna have to get home for that
um russell brandt had a video on
payments to cdc people
well i do su i do assume
that our uh regulators are corrupt
so i don't know which ones or
specifically anything it's not a
specific allegation but if you look at
especially the issue of
rapid tests
it seems to be just sort of obvious
there had to be massive corruption in
the fda it just seems obvious
now i could be convinced it didn't
happen
you know i'm not talking about some
specific individual or something but
from the outside
it seems pretty obvious that it was
corrupt
and and if it's not they certainly owe
us an explanation
and they didn't give us one that made
sense i mean they they explained it but
not in a way that wasn't stupid
so i'm pretty sure that the fda could
give us an explanation of why they
waited so long
that wasn't stupid
if it were real
right but the only thing they've offered
us are reasons that are stupid
and clearly they're all smarter than
than the explanation they've given us so
they they don't believe their own
explanation that's for sure
right i don't like to read minds
but if you know they're a certain level
of smart
but they've given you an explanation
that isn't even close to the level of
smart that they are
well there's something fishy going on
right that much you can know
please know that your words are powerful
i do know that
i do know that
it is what it is that's what i heard
jenna you just summoned up the entire
world that is what it is
if we didn't get vaxxed you didn't care
if we died
uh
have i seen carmen san diego no
um
is it possible for elon musk
not to come up in conversation in social
gatherings
i've not experienced it i've not
experienced it
i'm pretty sure pretty sure a hundred
percent of my recent
um
conversations with anybody he came up
i mean it used to be trump
but now it's it's him for a while it
used to be joe rogan in between
can we call the democratic party the
projection party i think you can call
them the um
vulnerable narcissist party
common cold is 40 of yearly flu deaths
is it
i don't think this is long is this a
long live stream i started late i don't
think it's that long
um
can you do a character based on kamala
maybe i could
oh okay
all right
then i guess we're done and i'm gonna go
talk to you tomorrow i'm gonna go do
some
work and maybe walk on the beach and
see if i can enjoy my last day here
and i'll be traveling tomorrow but i
think i'll have time to do my
[Music]
show in the morning
and
i'll see you then bye youtube
