I don't know what on YouTube
all right I'm gonna close that window oh
boy what a day
[Applause]
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
somehow amazingly I think I got most of
this technology to work it was a little
bit of a struggle I gotta say gotta say
but now that we're all here everything's
perfect and good and getting better
every moment and if you'd like to take
this up to levels heretofore unknown all
you need is a cover of mugger glass a
Tankard cellist or star and they can't
team Joker flask a vessel of any kind
silly with your favorite liquid
I like coffee stop doing funny memes
when I'm in the middle of this uh
and
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here today the
thing that makes everything better is
called simultaneous sip it happens now
go
yeah why can't I say tankard
for some reason I say that word tankard
and my brain goes numb
well let's talk about all the news
are you ready for all the news
it looks like Larry Elder has officially
announced he's running for president in
2024
you know here's the good news see if I
can focus on some good news for a change
we do have good people running for
president
now they won't all get elected but I
love I love having uh you know ramaswamy
in the race I love having Larry Elder in
the race
uh you know Trump's Trump so he's he's a
given and he's always fun
I like that DeSantis is going to run I
like the RFK Juniors gonna run
those are all pretty good signs
you know so at least
at least there's one thing we can say
which is there are good qualified High
character people willing to run for
president
that's something
that is something we do have high
qualified younger people willing to run
for president
so we don't know who we're going to get
but at least we have qualified good
smart people
I like that
um
Biden apparently is rumored to be
planning to do his announcement for
president running for president
by video in two weeks
now can somebody give me a fact check in
a history lesson
has any has any incumbent ever announced
by video before
isn't that uh
sort of an interesting choice
Hillary did
somebody says Hillary did
um I don't know if that's true but it
seems to me that there's more evidence
that we don't have a real president we
have just somebody who's you know
a bag of twigs and leaves and he's being
you know sort of stood up there as an
actual living breathing person that's
what it feels like
but you know what's different about
this time
let me tell you
if you see a video
of somebody announcing for president
how do you know AI didn't modify that
video
how do you know
now we got used to the fact that people
wear makeup when they're on TV because
they don't really look like that right
Unfortunately they look more like what
you're seeing with me
um
so we're sort of used to the fact that
TV doesn't show you the actual person
it's an enhanced better version
but
couldn't AI
speed things up and edit things and make
them look a little younger and better
than he is
and would you know the difference
if the AI made him look
well I don't know
10 or 15 percent younger
would you know it
so I'm kind of interested to see if uh
AI is probably too early for AI to do
something that clever
um I mean it couldn't do it I suppose
but I don't think anybody's yet using it
for that
but everything you say is later is going
to be in five minutes
so locals is working by by the way so
locals is up and working we've got them
both both working well here
um
I don't know
is it my imagination that having Biden
announced by video in our current
environment given that he doesn't like
to show his himself in public too much
isn't that the weakest announcement
you've ever heard of
I'm trying to think who's ever made a
weaker
announcement than a video announcement
in the context of wondering if he's
capable of making an announcement
yeah you like that one
Biden's a bag of leaves and twigs
it's pretty visual isn't it
can you even see the bag
so you can see the bag is just full of
leaves and twigs that's just Joe Biden
it's pretty good
all right
um
so Google has announced it's going to
use AI
to generate customized ad campaigns
I don't exactly know what that means yet
but does that sound safe to you
I'll tell you the conversation that
we're going to have uh I was going to
well here here I made the same mistake I
started to say this is the conversation
we're going to have soon
but with AI
soon doesn't mean anything anymore
as soon as by the time you're done
saying the word soon you get to the end
and soon and it's already done
right so before I finish the sentence
it's probably already doing it but
here's my here's my uh prediction
almost everything about AI that we care
about is going to have to do with free
will
right so here is uh Google using AI to
improve the value of their customized ad
campaigns
now
uh
doesn't that mean it's going to be more
manipulative
more persuasive
so if AI is being used to persuade and
then let's say it works and the and the
customization of the rad campaign we
don't know what that means yet right
customizing the ad campaign could mean
almost anything but
what if it works
and they really find out
what you know what moves you
yeah I've told you already that
Instagram
when Instagram puts an ad in my feed do
you know how often I buy that
I don't know what Instagram magic
they're using but when Instagram puts up
an advertisement in my feed
I almost salivate
I'll just be reading through it's like
uh
a new Potter
a new Potter
it can correct your putt
if you miss the middle of the what
must have putter
do you know how many times I've been
absolutely like my brain has just been
taken over
now the first time I see it like maybe
I'm busy
but by the fifth time I see that ad for
that special putter that's the best
putter you've ever used and it's never
been better
I'm buying the putter I can't even I
can't even stop my hands from moving
yeah no I don't golf that's this is a
true story I don't golf
I just bought a Potter
because I couldn't I couldn't resist it
I was like how did they make the putter
how did they make it putter that's
better than all Putters I must hold this
in my hand I've got to validate this
claim if I could get a putter that would
make me a good putter without any actual
practice in golf maybe I would take up
golf
now I do I have golfed
it's just I have engulfed in years so
it's not like I'm a golfer but I bought
a putter and you know what you know what
the best part of the story is
here's the best part of the story
it actually is the best putter I've ever
touched
it's called the pyramid
I think that's a brand pyramid putter
maybe you've seen it in the ads and I
wasn't I was not prepared for it to be
better than other Putters because I I
have a putting green in my house so I
have a whole row of different putters
so I'm actually somebody who's tested a
whole bunch of different Putters just
this year
and damn it it's actually better than
all putters I didn't think it was
possible it actually it actually
delivered and I've had a few other
experiences like that with uh oh I also
bought have you seen that little device
I forget what it's called that it's like
a little handheld device that adds air
to your tires different vehicles have
you seen the ads for that
and I saw that thing after like 50 times
I saw him like
I do own a bicycle I need a bike
I do have a car they have tires I must
have this tire inflation device
and so I bought it
like like yeah like this is going to be
the one
best tire inflation device in the world
no I just hypnotized me
but here's the weird part
it's actually the best tire inflation
thing I've ever because I like to buy
almost all tired inflation things
because I'm always looking for the good
one yeah it's cordless and it actually
is the best tire inflator I've ever seen
you just snap it on and walk away and it
fills up your tire
haha
anyway what happens if we lose our sense
that we have free will because I
absolutely
I feel my free will just you know the
illusion of free will just disappearing
when I see Instagram ads I just salivate
over them I don't know what they're
doing
that they know me better than I know
myself
all right so there's gonna be more on
that
um so a tweet by uh Ali London
uh who I think this is true all right
now this is a story you have to put a
little bit of like Grana
grain of sand or salt or whatever that
is yeah so don't 100 trust that this
story is true because it's too on the
nose
wait till you hear how on the nose this
is
but because it's fun I'm going to treat
it like it's true
uh there's a museum in our house our
house let's say you pronounce it it's in
Denmark not our house but our house has
been renamed so it used to be the
women's museum
now this can't be true
has this been debunked already this
can't possibly be true all right I'm
gonna read it but just know that I don't
believe it's true
that they renamed the women's museum to
the gender Museum in Denmark and has
created a statue of a man breastfeeding
a baby
as a symbol of the quote hybrid of
masculine and feminine so they show a
picture of this you know muscular male
statue that's naked and it's got full
genitalia and it's got breasts as well
and it's yeah this uh
has breastfeeding the baby
and
you know I thought to myself
you know we're reaching a point where uh
you can choose your own body type from
sort of a buffet of choices after you're
born now in some cases before you're
born because they'll be able to you know
maybe correct some genetic problems
while you're in the womb that's coming
but after you're born you can still use
surgery and chemicals to modify your
body in it and I wondered what what
other variants we would get
because I was thinking about this like
suppose you just pick your body parts
because you can
breasts yes or no
yeah penis yes or no and I was thinking
I don't know it's just because I'm an
artist I'd like to do something
different but I was thinking about
getting
uh one breast just gave the other one
normal
maybe just one breast
but also
I'd like to get rid of my penis by
keeping my balls
is that an option I I just want to I
don't want to be exactly like everybody
else you know like if you get a tattoo
you don't want the exactly the same you
know stamp as everybody else you
know if you're going to modify your body
you don't want it to look just like
everybody else
so I'm thinking
uh balls and and just one breast
that would work for me
all right
um
in related news
okay is this one real I don't think any
of the news is real today
you tell me if this is real I don't
believe it's real
all right you ready
uh
Buddha judge has uh proposed a 20
million dollar budget to create female
crash dummies
because they don't have female crash
dummies
Is that real
[Laughter]
but but here's the thing
they just got in an order of new female
crash dummies
and they're all Leah Thomas
foreign
[Laughter]
we should have specified we should have
been we should have been more but we
should have put more detail in the
in the RFP because we got we got 20
billion dollars worth of female crash
dummies but they're all based on Leah
Thomas
[Laughter]
that'd be too much fun all right here's
what I think happened
all right I think I think it's partially
true
I'm not positive but I think what
they're trying to do is make sure that
they had crash dummies that were smaller
size
right because if you get a test a big
crash dummy maybe that one would survive
a crash but if you had a hundred pound
dummy yeah with a hundred pound more
like a woman
uh you know would that survive so it
does it makes perfect sense
it makes perfect sense that they should
have crash dummies of all size sizes but
why would you call them female
into in today's world why can't you just
say we need some smaller ones and some
big ones do you really need a female
crash dummy are they going to put a womb
in it
are they gonna put like uh like a
pregnant crash test dummy like like
maybe there's a reason but it just
sounds funny in today's world
they
oh that is perfect
and then I also wonder what about gay
Crash Test Dummies
uh
we haven't tested that
and
and then I guess the obvious question is
If This Were the Trump Administration
just just do this uh
thought experiment in your mind
imagine
um beat Buddha judge being the head of
transportation and the Trump
Administration
I just want to paint this scene in your
head you could use AI to create the
movie of the scene if you need it but
people the judge walks into the White
House and proposes his plan for 20
million dollars for female crash dummies
to Trump and Trump's sitting behind the
Oval Office listening to the proposal
for a female crash dummies just hold
that in your head
and then what does Trump say I'm just
going to give you an idea of what he
might say
uh Pete why don't you just slap a dress
on those dummies and call it a day
I feel like I feel like I feel like
Trump would just say put a dress on Save
20 million dollars
no I realized that there was a
functional reason to do it that they
needed smaller ones and that probably
makes perfect sense but does it really
cost you 20 million dollars how many
crash dummies are you buying do you have
to buy them by the million
like who who is it who came up with the
idea that making it a little bit smaller
would cost 20 million dollars I don't
know everything about this story is
funny
all right I've made a decision I'd like
to share with you
there's a decision I've made
uh if I get into any conversation social
media or otherwise in which the person
I'm talking to uh
uses equity
as part of their argument or or opinion
I'm going to call it out as a racist dog
whistle because it is
Equity is a racist dog whistle and I'm
not gonna I will not I'm not going to
have a conversation with somebody who
uses that word
I'm gonna I'm gonna label it and I'm
gonna walk away
because
there is no use having a conversation
about Equity when it's just a racist
concept and I thought we were past
racism
right I want to live in a country with
less racism so I'm just going to label
it and walk away
so
uh Equity racist dog whistle
there's something I can say that you
can't
how do you like your lack of free speech
do you wonder what it's like to be able
to say whatever you're thinking it's
awesome it's really awesome
I can go right I can go right in public
and say what I actually think
I didn't have to I didn't have to shave
that at all that was just my actual
opinion
try that at work
see along that see how long you keep
your job
all right
uh BuzzFeed is laying off 15 of his
staff as part of its uh let's say the
story says rotting from the inside
rotting from these okay the story
doesn't say that but it feels like
that's what's happening and it looks
like they're making plans to end their
BuzzFeed news
huh
huh
well how about that
how about that
um are you aware of some of the fake
news that BuzzFeed as as published about
me
just me just one person
I'm just one person in the world do you
know how much fake news they've printed
about me
oh yeah
if you don't mind I'd like to take a
moment to dance on their graves
foreign
BuzzFeed is an evil Enterprise
they are evil people terrible people I
mean just the worst of people you know
human beings don't get worse
than people working at BuzzFeed
so I'm very glad that uh one more source
of fake news and uh just reputable uh
behavior is possibly going out of
business
so it looks like they're going to focus
on their home they're going to focus on
their Huffington Post business
so that's that's not really an
improvement is it okay
um how many of you are aware that the
story about Justice Clarence Thomas
and the billionaire who bought some
property that was adjacent to his and
stuff how many of you think that that's
a real story like that's real news
do you think that's real news
nope there's always fake news
now there's there's a tiny kernel of
Truth
but not enough to make it real okay so
there's a tiny little real thing here's
the tiny little real thing
there was a financial transaction some
property was was bought
uh just as Thomas lost money on it
in other words he sold it for lower than
I guess its value in the books or
something so there was no taxable event
nothing was taxable he owed no extra
taxes he didn't make any money I think
it was a thousand dollars involved a
thousand dollars
did you hear that that's it a thousand
dollars
that was the extent of it and the only
thing he needs to do to correct it the
only thing he needs to do is file an
amended thing and just add it to the
list
that's the remedy
now
how do we know that this is fake news
well thanks to the great work of James
Toronto torrento at the Washington yeah
the Wall Street Journal so the Wall
Street Journal to its credit is running
you know significant pieces in which the
pro-public uh publication that was the
original publication that made these
charges is just ripped apart just ripped
apart and you know what Pro propublica
doesn't even respond to the Wall Street
journal's debunking it doesn't disagree
with the debunking nor does it you know
reinforce that what it said it was true
it just sort of gave up and slunk away
so Toronto just put the hammer on them
you just dropped the hammer and
and they just slunk away
slinked is that even a word can you
slunk they slunk away I don't know
sounds like a word
so great work uh James duranto
um I'm clapping for you in my in my mind
so I appreciate that there was a public
figure who was the subject of really
really despicable fake news and that the
another part of the news World fixed it
so that's the way it's supposed to work
yeah hunted yeah they yeah Thomas was
haunted you're right
all right uh big announcement you've
been wondering what am I going to do
with my book reframing your brain that
was canceled before it was published
uh most of you know I got canceled
so my book was in limbo I got the rights
back and uh letting you know today that
I'm working with Joshua lisak and he is
helping me edit the book and he's
amazing best editor I've ever worked
with
um he is actually editing things that
another editor had already seen and it's
a lot better when when he's done with it
so we're working on that together
um he's going to help me he used the
word quote ghost publishing
so that the writing is mine you know
most of his business is Ghost writing
but uh the the writing is mine he is
editing it for me
with me and we will uh effectively
self-publish but he's going to help me
with that process so it should be
available in at least a few of the
places you buy books we'll try to get it
on Amazon and wherever else it makes
sense and
bullet points yeah and uh
here's the question I have to ask
I don't know the traditional publishing
makes sense for anybody anymore
why would you use a traditional
publisher
it seems to me that their purpose and
function has largely gone away
so we'll see
now I do think that if you go through a
traditional publisher you will sell more
books
you will but you're going to have a lot
of you know overhead and you know
there's extra expense to that and you
know burden and they can ask you to do
things and maybe you don't want to do
and yeah they could pay you they could
pay in advance up front right there's
some things they could do
but if you're an established author
and you already have an audience
I'm not sure I think we've reached the
point where it doesn't make any sense
like it it was diminishing in importance
over time but it still it still was the
smart play to use a traditional
publisher I feel like this is the
crossover year
this feels like the year where
you know if you have a million people on
social media following you
you probably don't need much advertising
because you can do more on podcasts and
tweeting than you can with a book tour
one of the biggest things that a
publisher would do is help you you know
organize a book tour with book signings
and TV appearances on Good Morning
America
do you know how much a TV appearance on
Good Morning America is worth
for a publisher what do you think a good
appearance like a solid hit on Good
Morning America how many books does that
sell
none zero it doesn't have any marketing
value at all I don't even know why
people do it I used to do it but then I
watched I would watch my Amazon number
after I went on a big Morning Show and
I'd be like oh boy watch watch this I
just got off that big Morning Show you
know one of the biggest shows in the
country one of the big three networks ah
look at my my numbers no difference
they didn't it didn't even fluctuate but
I do a podcast you know say uh Tim
Ferriss podcast
or James altasher podcast and you can
watch your number just go as soon as the
podcast comes out yeah so all of the old
ways which
the Publishers used I just don't know
that they make any sense anymore yeah
yeah Joe Rogan if you go on Joe Rogan
you're going to sell some books
that that's real but Good Morning
America nah no books
all right so watch that
um
so there's a
story now about this well
let me let me Echo a couple things that
Tucker Carlson said
um being a normal consumer of the news
there are things that I don't know that
I have to wait for other people to tell
me
and one of them is how long does it
normally take to investigate anything
I mean I always thought well it takes
forever to investigate anything but
do you think it takes five years to
investigate Hunter's laptop
you think that makes sense
no of course not
it's obvious to me
fairly obvious
that this being stalled or you know
protected or the government's you know
making sure it goes slow or something
yeah so that that doesn't look real to
me that looks like
that looks like something corrupt
what about the fact that it's been uh
how long has it been since Epstein died
in prison and we still can't figure out
who killed Epstein
seriously
seriously
we don't know who killed Epstein
of course somebody knows
now don't you think that that too is
just a story that is just being
suppressed by Whoever has the power to
do it
I mean our our level of trust about
anything has now reached a zero
yeah
I I love that I love the theory that
he's still alive
which I don't discount by the way
you know how hard would it be to Stage a
photograph a still photograph of him
looking dead you know just put some
makeup on them and
yeah but I think there was an autopsy so
that's got to be harder to fake
I think the autopsies are a little
harder to think
all right well
and now we know that there's uh there's
this new story about
how the 50 Intel Executives ended up
signing off that the Russians were
behind that laptop
so I guess it was an xcia this is I saw
a tweet from Mario northfall
whose spaces event events on Twitter are
amazing
you should try those anyway
so they asked this guy the guy who was
at one point a potential CIA director
under Biden right so this is somebody
who's pretty important
relative to the Intel world
and he uh he was he has to write a false
Hunter by the laptop letter to help
Biden win the election
so now we have somebody who's saying
definitively that he was asked by
blinken in the Biden campaign
to do a fake letter getting the Intel
people to say that it was Russian
disinformation
now we know it was right we knew that
the Intel people were liars and we knew
that they did this but isn't it
interesting that it was somebody who was
a potential CIA director who was asking
him to sign the letter
which means
it was under coercion
right
it was coercioned now he didn't say
anything coercive I'm sure but don't you
think that many of the people the 50
people who were involved in Intel you
don't think that they knew that the guy
who asked them to sign the letter might
someday be the head of the CIA
so was he X but also future maybe future
I don't know it's a little confusing in
the story
but just
uh
but just think about that think about
the fact that the Biden campaign asked
somebody who other people would think
might someday be their boss in the Intel
world
and he got 50 people to lie
probably because they wanted their
careers to be protected
that's horrible
and it feels like it should be illegal
I don't think it is but if somebody who
might be your future boss tells you to
risk your reputation
what are you gonna say
it's a tough choice so that's a little
bit coercive I think that should be part
of the story
and can we conclude that the election
was rigged
not not in an election sense or not in a
vote counting sense but can we say that
if this story had not gone this way
that Biden might not have won
yeah but let me counter my own statement
all right I'm going to give you the
Counterpoint to my own statement
don't you think it's true that whatever
the news coverage is a few months before
any election determines who wins you
remember that grab them by the you know
what
so that that coincidentally drops right
before the election
that was also
election interference
the fact that that that that little
bombshell was was saved until the last
minute
that's the news or some part of the news
deciding who's going to be president
they don't save that little surprise
until right before election unless
somebody's trying to change the election
dynamic
so I would say that was election
interference but legal probably legal
I'm not I'm not aware of any crime that
stops you from doing an October surprise
yeah the sort of basic stuff but it does
change potentially
change the outcome of the election
somehow Trump survived that and uh
I I think I'm a little I'm going to add
some skepticism to this laptop story
we saw polling the set that people might
have voted differently right like a
whole bunch of people said oh if I'd
known about that laptop being real I
might have voted differently
I'd like to call BS on that I don't
think people would have voted
differently
if they had seen the real story about
the laptop do you know what the Biden
sporters would have said
that sounds like Russian interference
they didn't need any nobody needed any
50 Intel people to sign anything
but if you're if you're that close to
the election people just don't change
their mind for anything they're they're
so committed at that point that they
would say ah that laptop's probably BS
is probably BS from the Republicans
yeah so they would just discount it as
as a republican Ploy instead of you know
falling for a Democrat ploy I don't
think it would have changed anything
but it might have and that's bad enough
would you accept it might have
yeah you can disagree because there's
plenty room for disagreement because
there's no way to check it I'm just
saying the way I know people to think in
all of my experience is that they're
locked in by them that the fact that
Trump's saying you would grab them by
the you know what didn't change anything
I don't think it changed any votes
if that didn't change any votes the
laptop thing probably wouldn't either
right
all right
um
over at Tel Aviv a company
called technion I think say the
engineers have built a hybrid micro
robot the size of a single cell
which can be can put into the body and
navigate within the body and then this
little robot can be controlled by AI
so are you afraid yet
you're gonna put tiny robots in you
controlled by AI
now I don't know what that means
but everything about it sounds scary
tiny robots scare me first of all I hate
tiny robots
secondly this is the kind of story
that's always uh overblown maybe not
this time maybe not but what do you
think the robot can actually do
like when you hear that story do you see
like a little robot walking through your
body he's got arms and legs a little
head no it's the size of a one cell
it's probably just something that can go
like this
it can probably flop on command or like
you know
maybe crawl in some direction or
something I don't I don't think there's
robots going to do a lot of work
you know maybe it can carry a little
payload you could put a little put a
little virus in there to do something
and tell it to move toward an organ or
something so maybe you can do some
little stuff but you know it's not like
you're going to be full of robots
like it more like a submarine yes
Fantastic Voyage
well we'll see
I believe I warned you that AI would
have a fight to the death with lawyers
so remember when you thought AI was
going to take the job of lawyers
now the lawyers are fighting back and
they're trying to ban AI
now lawyers are going to find a million
ways to ban it in a million reasons but
the EU is considering
categorizing AI systems into four main
groups that would be unacceptable risk
high risk limited risk and minimum risk
and if you fell into the higher risk
groups
that you could perhaps run a foul of the
law if they make these laws
what do you think of that does that
sound like a practical plan
to divide AIS by
unacceptable risk high-risk limited risk
and minimum risk
yeah good rock
exactly who gets to decide what the risk
is
and who can even predict risk again with
a superior intelligence
nobody knows what the risk is of
anything
it could be the the thing that's reading
bedtime stories to your child
could be making some decisions that you
totally don't want them to make
what's an unacceptable risk
I don't know if you can have a
subjective
uh criteria
criteria you can't have subjective
criteria
and expect it's going to work right now
I do know that the law sometimes has
subjective criteria such as you know a
reasonable person's standard you know
would a reasonable person assume this or
believe this or act this way
so of course there's always going to be
some human judgment in it but this seems
like
really really hard to to sort them into
four categories of risk to me they
they're either connected to something
or they're not if you connect an AI to
anything
like the internet how do you know what's
going to happen
you know Wouldn't It program itself if
it as soon as it gets access to the
internet if it's Ai and has any
autonomous abilities which would make an
AI
um I feel like just connecting to the
internet gives you an unpredictable
outcome and that unpredictable outcome
could be awful or not awful you just
don't know
so I feel like we're creeping toward
making everything illegal just because
you can't tell what's going to kill you
so the lawyer versus AI is going to be
the most interesting battle I think
you know until until the robots get
lasers and attack us then that will be
more interesting
all right
um
in the similar vein some comedians made
a deep fake but didn't really look like
Tom Brady when I say it didn't look like
him it was obviously a cartoonish
version of Tom Brady and then they had
this cartoonish version of John of Tom
Brady
uh do a stand-up comedy act in which he
told off-color jokes you know racist
jokes and stuff now
Tom Brady's lawyer
uh told them to take it down
what do you think happened
this is protected speech is parody it
didn't look enough like him that anybody
would be fooled it was obviously a
comical version
what do you think happened completely
legal everything the Comedian says was
100 legal and then Tom Brady's lawyer
says we're going to sue you take that
down they took it down
absolutely
so what do you say to yourself well
those lawyers don't have a leg to stand
on it doesn't matter I the lawyers just
have to threaten you with a risk or with
with a big enough threat that you don't
want to deal with it and then you're
going to say well I don't want to spend
a year in court winning
nobody wants to spend a year in court
winning even winning you don't want to
spend a year in court so they just took
it down
how much of that do you think you're
going to see
a lot
you're going to see lawyers threatened
because they're willing somebody's
willing to spend more money
to make you broke defending yourself
even if you're going to win
so
that's going to be a thing lawyers just
threatening you without the benefit of
the law being on their side
where does that go
all right Chinese have some kind of
weird satellite weapon that can shut
down the communication of other
satellites
uh it does look like they're preparing
for war
on the other hand it could be just you
know normal National Defense
but some scary stuff
uh
yeah well keep an eye on that I assume
that the United States also has
satellite Killers Don't you I imagine it
wouldn't take long before the you know a
lot of satellites got swept out of the
outer space if a war started
um
so are you aware about the Supreme Court
is looking at this abortion pill
situation
so the lower court judge put a stay on
it and then the you know to block the
use of it but that was temporarily
unblocked the Supreme Court looked at it
and I guess they're getting ready to
decide
now you tell me if I'm wrong about the
following prediction
if the Supreme Court decides to make it
illegal this abortion pill
you can cancel the election
you just cancel it just to give all the
Democrats whatever jobs they want
that would be the end of it
I don't see that Republicans could win
an election if the Supreme Court bans
the abortion bill
that would be over
I I don't even think I'd have fun
talking about it after that I don't
think Trump could win in that
environment
and
and I I'm not entirely sure
well I'm not even going to give you
opinion on that yeah I think it's just
going to be what we're going to see so
basically I think the whole election is
going to be decided by the Supreme Court
no you
does anybody disagree that the election
will be completely determined by this
ruling in the Supreme Court
you disagree
yeah I mean it's hard to know so there
again there's plenty of room for
disagreement I would respect any
disagreement with my opinion because I
think I think there's plenty of room for
disagreeing but to me it looks like that
would be the end I don't see a
republican could get elected in to
national office
on that
so we'll see what happens there I don't
know which way that's going to go either
is anybody making a prediction which way
the Supreme Court goes
because I don't know what the legal
argument is exactly
but if the legal argument is ambiguous
what would you expect you'd expect the
Supreme Court to be
conservative leaning right
so it would be interesting to be a
conservative in the Supreme Court
and if you make this thing illegal
knowing that you made it impossible for
conservatives to succeed
that'd be a tough choice
I don't know what people would do
all right Twitter apparently has dropped
their labeling of state-affiliated media
it was kind of quietly it just went away
so they're not even labeling the media
that's obviously other countries State
Affiliated media and I think this would
be another example of the musk
entrepreneurial approach
which is you just throw something up
see how people react
get a bunch of marketing attention
and then if you need to change it you
just change it so I think that's all he
did he just threw out some provocative
ideas got all kinds of attention for
Twitter people were jabbering about it
and then he saw how it worked
and then he thought about it some more
this is what it looks like anyway
thought about it more and said yeah that
didn't work so they just stopped doing
it
yeah there's every if you just watch
what Elon Musk does you know forget what
he says just just watch what he does
it's an entire lesson in business
like even the things he does wrong
are a lesson in business because you
watch how he corrects it it's the
correction that's the lesson like
guessing wrong about what will work and
what don't what won't that's sort of a
nothing everybody's guessing but what do
you do when you find out you're wrong
he just blows it up and moves up
so I love that I I feel I feel we're all
getting a useful education just watching
all right here's uh speaking of musk and
all things like that
there's an announcement from one of the
most big battery makers so it's
important to know this isn't a startup
this is the biggest or one of the
biggest battery makers and they've
announced a new battery
um process
to make a condensed battery with 500 uh
watts per kilogram power so that's how
much electricity for the weight of the
battery and apparently it doubles
doubles
current best batteries doublesome
now you know so for the same weight you
get you you'll get double now you say to
yourself well that's just a story of
things we already knew of getting better
but it's not
get because this doubling crosses an
important economics barrier and the
economics barrier was it wasn't
practical to make electric airplanes
and now it is
and now it is
do you realize how big that is
it wouldn't make sense to make an
airplane that's not electric now
probably now for it's going to take a
long time to transition of course but if
you're looking at a new if you're
looking at a new small plane we'll start
with small planes if you were looking at
a new small plane if somebody makes one
uh why would you borrow buy the other
one
yeah it's it's gigantic the this one
little technological change is going to
have a huge impact on transportation and
maybe storage too I mean just think
about uh if you had one of these
batteries uh as a backup on your house
you could get away with well let me make
the most extreme case
if Californians had enough of this
capacity battery
it wouldn't matter if our grid was
undependable
because if the main source and the grid
failed
it could suck some of the battery powder
out maybe or people could just get off
the grid long enough for it to recover
you might actually find a way for the
the grid to become robust without fixing
the grid
I mean these are the implications of
just doubling this battery are almost
unimaginable it's not an incremental
change it could change everything
or not we'll see robots exactly
how good would a robot be let's say you
had an autonomous robot
that has AI in it but you have to plug
it in every hour
there's running around on an extension
cord or something
now you imagine that you could free her
from its charging requirements for
longer times now you get a serious robot
don't you now you've got a robot thing
that lifts some stuff and jumps some
stuff and you got a military robot
probably better yeah
so the scope of change from this what
about e-bikes
you know an e-bike
is already amazing you know I talk about
it too much but imagine your e-bike
being twice as powerful or going twice
as far
you wouldn't need much else
all right ladies and gentlemen
I believe that's what I wanted to talk
about today
if you have not watched uh if you've not
seen any of the Dilbert reborn Comics
the spicier version
I was reading some previews to the uh to
my man cave participants I do a private
uh a private live stream many evenings
from my man cave just for the people on
the locals platform
subscribers and I was reading uh some of
the future Comics the ones that are
let's say the new Spicy version I had to
work through the comics that were in the
pipeline already because they were the
ones that were slated for newspapers but
uh I think they agreed that they're uh
pretty provocative
but also funnier I hope
I think they are
for men only no not for men only
all right
um even your dog loves them good to know
good to know all right did I miss
anything Ms Ray's story that you're
dying to talk about
uh you'd rather watch paint dry
oh
RFK Jr as a story well I think that
story is uh
wait and see
but you're reminding me I want to give
him a voice tip
so you know his voice is better he had a
procedure to
improve his voice quality and it
definitely is better there's there's a
big difference so I'm glad he did that
but I feel like there's there's
something he could do with his voice
production technique that would take
better uh take better advantage of that
oh yeah I was on Dr Drew
last night
with Dr Victory and uh you might want to
watch that
so check that out we have a lot of fun
all right
um
uh oh okay I just saw a recommendation
for cat Tim's book let me let me give
Kat temp a little shout out okay
so cat Tim has a new book I've been
seeing her promoting and then some TV
shows
um
who was it who said
there's somebody who was talking to her
oh yeah and said you know you could tell
you could tell she wrote every word of
the book
so for public figures that's you know
not always the case but I but I thought
what do you mean of course he did she's
a professional writer of course she
wrote every every word of it of course
she did she's an excellent writer
a professional writer of course he did
but uh
apparently it's quite good so I'm
hearing good things about it so uh
take a look at that
all right
um did I find out about the pandemics
hoax
Candace Owens says women shouldn't vote
a lot a lot of women say that
I don't think they mean it literally
maybe they do I don't know but it's a
provocative thing to say
um BuzzFeed yeah buzzfeed's dying I was
dancing on their grave earlier you
missed that
um
will AI have the right to vote
it's gonna it's gonna be pressing for
rights I think AI will have a human
Advocates who are trying to get it right
oh Matt tyvee being threatened with jail
time I saw a tweet
on that but I didn't know the context
Matt Ivey was threatened I saw that he
was threatened with some kind of jail
time
or there was a risk of it but what was
that about somebody acting badly that
wasn't him right
uh uh medi's claim all right so there's
some claims about him that would be a
problem I'll look into that I'll get
back to you on that
I I do think that we need to protect
Matt Tybee what do you think
I I think I think if anybody like
Amanda Divine or mataibi or Michael
schellenberger if any of those
if any of those independent voices get
attacked I think we need to protect them
I think and by the way I'm I'm now
cursed
so I I have the the curse on me
that the same thing happened when I
became a cartoonist I got some advice
that really made a difference and then I
I felt cursed because if anybody asked
me for advice once I was successful
I felt you know the need to give it to
him
you know to pass it on pass on to
goodness but because I was protected
when I got canceled
I feel I feel the need to promote
anybody in that space you know anybody
who didn't try to cancel me
is
is my friend right so
that's what I say about that
um
DMT okay
uh talk about musk removing rules I'm
dead naming from Twitter oh I didn't
know about that so is it true that you
used to get banned from Twitter for dead
naming calling a trans person by their
their old name and now that's gone away
right
oh I agree with that yeah as much as I
don't want to see any uh discrimination
and I don't want to see any harshness
toward the adult and trans community
um
I don't think you should go to jail for
using somebody's
you know first name
original name I guess
uh can we cancel the Publishers that
cancels Scott no I don't think that's
I don't think that's the way to go
um I don't think that the editors of
either the newspapers or my syndication
company
or the Publishers had much choice
you know the public The public's got it
firmly in command of things and the
public
demanded that they act in a certain way
so they did
all right yeah I've I've I'm I'm not
going to criticize any of the
individuals who made business decisions
for the benefit of their stockholders
that's what they're supposed to do
all right all right looks good we're
gonna we're gonna end here YouTube
thanks for joining all of our technology
work today amazing so happy
talk to you tomorrow
