so here's a typical question that the
news would say
um the news says that uh you know
they're calling you uh Hitler
so instead of saying I'm not Hitler
you're Hitler that's what don't
Republicans usually say that I'm not
Hitler you're Hitler how's that work out
it doesn't
how about this
well you know here's our we're working
on this plan to fix this problem and the
Democrats are mostly working on a plan
of how to more cleverly insult us
and if you think that working on a plan
to more cleverly insult the citizens is
where you want to put your energy you
have that option but I hope
you'd work with us to improve our plan
which admittedly will never be perfect
you know we'll have to work on it do a
little a b testing a little tweaking and
if you don't like it on day one work
with us
we'll try to improve it but you have to
work within the rules of what makes
sense free markets
you know less regulation
