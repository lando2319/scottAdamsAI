and welcome to what will surely be
the highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Adams do you think today will
be fun
yeah you do you do but how fun will it
be well unlimited but if you'd like to
take it up to stratospheric levels all
you need is
a copper mugger a glass of tanker
chalices Diner canteen Joker flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine the other day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
oh yeah that's good well
there were some big news yesterday I
don't know if any of you caught it
uh big news everybody's talking about it
uh
uh there's a movie called cocaine bear
cocaine bear
and uh although some think it's been a
bad year for the uh for the left
Hollywood did manage to produce some
high-level entertainment it's about a
bear who gets into some cocaine
and then becomes a rather a vicious
cocaine bear
so was there anything else that happened
yesterday
that's all I can remember something
about a cocaine bear oh oh also
something about Twitter
something about Twitter
I get that confused with a cocaine bear
you you know you can see how that would
happen right it's like Twitter gate
cocaine bear it's practically the same
story you just changed some of the names
uh but we'll get to that first Wall
Street Journal reports said about 25
percent of Manufacturers have reduced
operations in China over the past year
one quarter of Manufacturers have
reduced
Chinese exposure
And So It Begins
how many of you believe that any of that
was going to happen when I started
telling you it was going to happen a few
years ago
I'll bet you didn't now I didn't see the
pandemic coming
but it did look to me like that China
was too unsafe for business in a variety
of ways and that variety I could not
anticipate
but I did tell you it would be too
dangerous to do business in China and
here we are
probably one of the least
predictable predictions of all time
can you you know how many other people
predicted that like five years ago
not many well I think I started in 2018.
so four years ago
um
all right there's a story that uh
Vladimir Putin fell down some stairs at
his home
and apparently he defecated uh himself
on the way down the stairs this is a
report you know it's not exactly the
most confirmed report because it's a
report of something that privately
happened inside Vladimir Putin's home
I don't know that we have good
information about that
but it's a good story
um and uh the story says that Putin has
cancer and Parkinson's and that was
related to why falling down the stairs
made him defecate himself
now
to me this was not the most surprising
story
the most surprising story about this is
I really had I had a hundred dollar bet
that Biden would be the first world
leader to fall downstairs and
himself
but Putin takes he takes the lead he was
the first leader to fall down the stairs
and himself now apparently
this is uh he had a little practice
because Putin had already uh when he
invaded Ukraine
he had already the bed
so now he's the stairs and there's
some report that he was taken to a couch
where he probably shut the couch so now
Putin knows she had a uh a couch some
stairs and the bed
uh but at least he's consistent he's
shedding everything
and Biden
still good
so I think we elected the right guy
Biden's still holding strong
keeping that feces inside him where it
belongs
um jobless rate is 3.7 I think that's
going to get a little higher because the
layoffs that are coming but that's
pretty strong
remember I tell you that there's one
economic indicator I care about the most
it's the most predictive
and that is the jobless rate
so no matter what things you think are
going wrong as long as that jobless rate
looks pretty good and it does
we can we can power through whatever
we're doing
it's only the jobless rate if you lose
that you're in trouble
like that's depression time
but if people have jobs even with
inflation and even with other
difficulties they can muddle through
until things get better so we'll I think
we'll be fine it'll be it's going to be
difficult for about two years
but we'll be fine
I tweeted around a blog post that I
wrote in 2015
in which I predicted yay would become
president
and my prediction was that he would fail
in 2020 fail in 2024
and succeed in 2028.
now
what I didn't predict exactly was the
swastika business and the uh the death
God on the Jews business didn't see that
coming did not see that coming
but let me ask you this can you see any
scenario in which he could recover from
that
is there any scenario in which she could
recover
because he's never going to get the
Jewish uh the Jewish population of the
United States back don't you think and
that's gone forever
can you get elected under those
circumstances given how many people
would feel the same
okay
I see one way
he has one path believe it or not and it
would go like this
if he frames himself at his campaign as
a free speech absolutists
suddenly it looks different doesn't it
and suppose he says you know what I was
probably acting out of anger
because I was I was divorced and had
some business difficulties but you know
what
I probably should not have said things
the way I did
and so you know I don't have this bad
feeling about all Jews that's not what I
was saying but I was acting out and
here's the bigger issue can I say what I
feel
can I say what I feel no matter how
odious it is no matter how hateful no
matter how how much it bothers you can I
say it
if he does that
it's going to get interesting
he would out he would have to
unambiguously reverse his position
but if he sold it to you yes I was
acting out and I was I wanted to see how
far I could push the boundary of free
speech
do you remember the first offensive
thing he said before the well the Jewish
business
have you already forgotten
what what was the big provocation you
did before he went Defcon on the Jews
using his words
do you remember what it was
it was White lives matter
ah
now think about the context
add White lives matter to the whole
story
if you see the if you see the uh yay
goes off on the Jews as the entire story
everything about that is terrible
like that's that's you you have to get
rid of that right if you see it by
itself
if you see it as part of a clear
intention to figure out what it is he
can't say and then say it as much as he
can
it starts making it looks different
doesn't it
he started by saying White lives matter
basically he said what's the thing that
I would most get canceled for and that
he did it really aggressively
and then when he realized that people
were gonna
that he couldn't say anything about the
Jewish population
he went right at it
and I'll bet you if you could figure out
anything that's worse than what he's
already done oh he also defended
Balenciaga
he defended balenciago
and said you know that the pedophile
stuff was a limited number of people and
so you shouldn't played in the whole
company
all right nobody who was black was
saying White lives matter except Kansas
Owens I suppose
no one would say would say what he said
about the Jewish community in the United
States
odious and you know must be disavowed
and nobody would nobody would have
defended balenciago under that current
condition
if everything he does is he is he models
doing the thing you're not supposed to
do he can put that together as a
portfolio
you can say look
I'm defending Free Speech I'm gonna I'm
gonna move your boundaries out and
you're not going to like it but that's
not the point
the point is not we all agree the point
is oh yeah we love each other and find a
way to get along but free speech is an
absolute
and I I'll apologize for hurting
somebody maybe maybe he says that later
but uh but I'm not going to apologize
for free speech because when I said it I
meant it
right what if he says that you know when
I said it I was really mad I was in a
bad place and I I meant every word of it
but now in my more grounded perspective
I see that it hurts some people that
didn't need to be hurt
and that it was more negative than
positive but I will defend to the death
my right to have said it
it would be an interesting argument
wouldn't it
interesting argument
um
but you I I don't think he could ever
get the Jewish Community back but I'll
uh but I'll give you one way he could
here's one way he could actually get the
entire Jewish Community back
give them everything they want
do you know how Joe Biden won despite
the fact that he's a walking bag of
sticks
because he he promised to give the
Democrats what they wanted and that was
more important
if yay said you know I was totally wrong
about that
but here my policies about Israel and
about whatever
about anti-Semitism and I'm going to go
as hard as possible to make sure there's
no more anti-Semitism and Israel does
well
then what
then what
then what does the Jewish Community say
well
we really did hate him when he said that
thing but everything he's saying now
sounds good and everything he's doing
now sounds good
so what are you going to do
so the only thing I'm going to say about
this is that
don't be surprised by anything
that's all just don't be surprised by
anything
and I want to make sure that I'm this
doesn't sound like I'm defending yay's
opinions
I'm not
right because the whole point of this is
that we all understand
you know what he said to be
across the line of not free speech and
certainly within his Free Speech but
it's across the bounds of what a public
figure should be doing if they're trying
to do good for the country
I think I think yay is likely to come
around to that point of view and uh
but by the time he does he's going to
create five more
five more controversies so he's not done
creating controversy I don't think
all right
let's talk about Russian disinformation
have you all seen by now the compilation
clips of the media telling us that the
hunter laptop story was obviously
obviously Russian dis oh so obviously
Russian disinformation oh there's no we
don't have any verification of that
it's very embarrassing now that musk has
allowed the real story to come out which
we'll talk about
very embarrassing and so I said to
myself how do those media entities
handle it
you know when they're caught red-handed
doing the worst thing you could do if
your immediate entity how do they handle
it
well the CNN front page today no mention
no mention
so let me I'd like to I'd like to make
an adjustment to something I said about
CNN recently now recently I've been
saying that Chris liked or licked I'm
not sure how to pronounce it liked light
uh the new head of CNN
was doing in my opinion a great job
because he said he was going to bring
CNN to the reasonable medal and it
looked like the reporting did exactly
that it looked like the
Personnel moves were definitely on
target
and then this happens
how do we explain this
you do you think that the head of CNN is
not aware
that the entities he manages is
intentionally hiding the biggest door of
the year do you think he's not aware of
that of course he is of course he is
so
Chris light or let or whatever your name
is you
 you you piece of you
piece of I thought you had some
potential and I supported you against
against my critics against my critics I
took your side you piece
of you are a traitor you are not a
patriot you are a piece of
you are scum
tell us the news
show the news
suck it up I was ready to forgive
everything
I was ready to forgive CNN completely so
long as they corrected
but no this shows that there is no
 correction going on this
is disgusting is disgusting it makes you
sick
to see that they're they're Americans in
your country who would do this to you
because they had to see you then he's
 you he's you right now
he's feeding you like a piece of
and we should treat him the same
I mean his business not him personally
don't do anything to him personally we
we don't encourage going after people
but I am just blown a way
now how about the Washington Post big
front front page story
no
nope nope nope but do I hold it against
the Washington Post as much as CNN nope
I don't because CNN lied to us they said
they're coming to the middle and they
 lied
bastards the rest of them at least
they're they're they're staying true to
their nature right the New York Times or
you know now how about the New York
Times I'm guessing the New York Times
covered it did they
and by the way shout out to axios
shout out to axios axios covered it just
like it's news
exactly the way you're supposed to cover
the news like it's news
they covered it
good
so axios you get an A plus for being an
independent reasonable entity for news
and I would recommend all of you
to bookmark axios because they actually
showed that they they are an asset to
the country
okay CNN showed you that they are a
detriment to the country
we've been talking about like who you
like for entertainment and news this is
 about the country
I mean this is actually an attack on
America you see it CNN not covering this
is an attack on America I mean really I
can't I could not be
more pissed off
but
uh msnbc's yeah what are they going to
do today
so here's how the left is starting to
spin it by the way you all know this
story by now right do I need to tell you
what the Twitter gate story is All About
let me hit the highlights all right this
is just in case somebody doesn't know
so musk yesterday said he was going to
Tweet out uh the details of the hunter
laptop story and what Twitter did to
suppress it uh he had Matt taibi
investigative journalist who is very
well respected on both the left and the
right which is very important in the
entire world there probably was not a
better choice for Elon Musk than Matt
Tybee he's one of the few people who you
think will call balls and Strikes on
both sides like very rare in fact name
the second person
right name the other person who could do
that job
like I can't even think one if
you yeah if you said Glenn Greenwald
he's a little bit too
a little too controversial he would be
my second choice perhaps
bow taibi was by far
the best choice for this right
so type B does the the Tweet storm
um you know we're waiting like three to
seven minutes for each new tweet and it
was oh my God it was it was so hard to
wait for the next tweet because you're
just there ah ah come on come on I mean
I started to get like mental disturbance
from like wanting it so hard but here's
what we have learned
among other things Twitter did indeed
suppress the story it was a major
conversation within Twitter
and
they did know that they were making up a
reason for suppressing it
that was my take does anybody disagree
with that take
that people within Twitter knew they
were lying and that the LIE they came up
with is that they couldn't confirm the
laptop was not hacked do you know what
else you can't confirm wasn't hacked
pretty much everything
there's lots of things you can't confirm
it doesn't make it not news
so so it looks like Twitter
intentionally made up a story
that would pass the legal muster because
you can always say well we weren't sure
it wasn't hacked so it gives you this
total out and and you can see the lawyer
Baker the the lawyer did the best job of
making sure that when he was discovered
later because lawyers are smarter about
what they write down
way smarter right you rarely will see a
right a lawyer write down something that
sounds illegal because they know not to
write that down
and so the way Baker did it was the most
clever say yes we we literally don't
have a way to confirm that that wasn't
hacked
and I guess that's technically true
so they did make up a thing the
other thing we learned is that there
were a number of people within Twitter
apparently I don't know how many who
could uh kick somebody off of Twitter or
suspend them and so they were getting
requests from both the Trump
Administration
important point and also the Biden
administrator or the yeah they were
getting both the Democrats and the and
the Republicans asking them for getting
rid of users or suppressing users
so not only did they totally suppress
the laptop story but they used a tool
that they only use for pedophiles
you couldn't even DM
privately to another person the story
about the hunter laptop story
you couldn't privately DM it to somebody
now that they only did that for
pedophile stuff
that's how deeply and how hard they
tried to suppress this thing
uh we also found out that requests to
ban individuals by name were accepted
and James Wood was specifically
mentioned by the Democrats to be kicked
off and he was
now
does anybody remember me telling you
that I didn't think that uh Jack Dorsey
was necessarily aware of everything that
was happening below the hood how many
people heard me say that
because it could all right we're getting
lots of yeses on the
um the locals Channel because they've
seen me the longest all right so we see
CBS I needed you to confirm that because
I'm the only person who predicted it
would you agree would you also agree
that nobody else in the world
predicted that Jack Dorsey might not
know the whole story of what's Happening
below the hood
right now
how did I predict that
let me tell you how I predicted it
two factors number one is the Dilbert
factor which says that the people at the
top very often don't know what's
happening this is just a very common
situation
number two
I like to think I'm at least a
reasonable judge of character
and I had enough interaction with Jack
to know it would have been completely
out of his character
to be just lying about this like just a
straight lie
to me he looked like he actually had a
mystery that he couldn't solve either
and it looks like probably it took musk
to get in there and fire enough people
and do enough stuff that uh that they
could get to the bottom of it so I'm
going to take credit
for correctly noting that it didn't look
like it would have been in character for
Jack to have known everything that was
happening and that if you're if you're
managing two companies
you know that's going to happen that's
that's the obvious risk is that if
you're managing two companies you're
gonna have one of them running at least
one of them running autonomously and
that's what was happening
all right
um
so then there's a question of uh was
Twitter violating
the First Amendment here's what musk
says
most we did Twitter acting by itself to
suppress free speech is not the First
Amendment violation by acting under
orders from the government to suppress
free speech with no judicial review is
now Ted Lou famous Democrat had an
exception to that and he replied he goes
dear Elon Musk I'm in the government and
I order you to stop posting stupid
and then he goes on see why your post is
wrong Twitter can do whatever it wants
as a private sector company when it
comes to speech and the Biden campaign
team wasn't the government
uh Trump was president in 2020. So Not
only was it not the government it was a
campaign
but even if the government did ask
Twitter to do something about Free
Speech Twitter could
just ignore them because they're a
private company
that's his argument
now does anybody remember
in the way back machine a common thing
that was said about a president named
Trump I believe they used to say that he
didn't need to explicitly say what he
meant because his Mafia talk said it all
does the mafia talk where you don't say
what you need but everybody knows
everybody knows if you say take care of
Bob
that means Whack Him right but
deniability I just said take care of him
I didn't say kill him I said take care
of them so the mafia talk was real
that that's what the Democrats told us
but in this case there was no Mafia talk
so when the person who is likely to
become your next president asked you to
do something and that next president has
the power to maybe get you held heavily
regulated or taxed
what are you gonna do
are you going to say no my government
telling me something to do something
that's really really important to them
I'll just ignore that and that'll work
out fine for me
did Chuck Schumer tell you that a
government entities sometimes will get
revenge oh yes he did Chuck Schumer told
himself that the Intel agencies would
get revenge on Trump for messing with
them
do you think it's only Intel agencies
who get revenge
no
no
so I would say to Ted Liu this is an
interesting Supreme Court case because
in my opinion if somebody who's going to
be a government entity asks you to do
something and you do it it's at least an
implied threat
am I right
wouldn't you see it as an implied threat
and is an implied threat enough of a
threat to violate the First Amendment
I'm going to say if you put me on that
jury I guess I'd have to be in the
Supreme Court but I would say yes I
would say that is a clear case of a
violation of a First Amendment but there
is room for opinion I could see how
somebody would have a different opinion
Maybe
um
and then I replied to Ted Liu and I said
in this hypothetical you know where Ted
Lou is asking Twitter to do something
and they ignore him I said in this
hypothetical do you also have the power
to punish Twitter with burdensome
regulations if they don't bend to your
will as a private company
I'm guessing that he won't answer that
just guessing
you know who I haven't seen the last
couple days uh Carl Bernstein
also known as the worse than Watergate
guy because I wonder if anything has
happened recently that's worse than
Watergate
something that really just screams out
for the worse than water gay guy to go
on CNN and say it's worse than Watergate
I guess we won't see him
um
now what about the fact that the Trump
White House did it too
now I am concerned because when Matt
taibi said he said it clearly so that we
all know this this was not
just the Biden campaign this was not
just Democrats this was the Trump
Administration also asked Twitter to
suppress some things
but without examples
how do we know if that's the same or
something different
do you have a general problem with your
government flagging things they should
be banned
do you think that's a problem
I don't think it's a problem if it's
users of Twitter doing it
so if there's a government employee who
uses Twitter and they're also a user I
believe that they can ask Twitter to do
things as users because they're citizens
so if a any user whether it's a
government or somebody else goes to
Twitter and says here's an account
that's promoting hate or violence let's
say
anybody could do that right there's no
there's no
nobody's stopping you from accessing
Twitter and reporting something
now the government because they have you
know connections they might be able to
reach an actual individual at Twitter
and make an individual complaint
but I did that I reached like real
humans at Twitter
and had real complaints and you know
they addressed it I believe every
citizen has access to Twitter
right
so if the Trump Administration asked
Twitter to do something all that really
matters is what did they ask them to do
the problem is not that they asked
I'm totally okay with the asking
is what did they ask
if if you're asking to get rid of James
Woods because James is it Wonder Woods
if you're asking to get rid of somebody
because they're politically inconvenient
bad very bad if you're asking to get rid
of somebody because they violated
Twitter's terms of service but Twitter
might not be aware of it
good that's good
right if you're telling Twitter to
suppress the news
that's bad that's very bad
but you get that the story is not who
asked or that they asked right do you
all get that everybody can ask Twitter
to do anything they want
including the government because I agree
with uh Ted Lu's basic comment
they're asking Twitter to do something
isn't by itself a problem
it's what you ask them to do
if you ask them to suppress the most
important story of the country you
if you ask them to look at an account
that violated uh Twitter's own terms of
service
fair enough I mean I've done that myself
right so I'm going to criticize Matt
taibi for not telling us a little bit
more about what the Trump Administration
did because it leaves us to speculate
and that's not good we we should not be
speculating
now right that's what this is when they
should just tell us what is true no more
speculating
maybe we'll find that out soon I I
suspect we will actually
um I was fascinated to see that the
narrative within Twitter was so similar
to what the media outside of Twitter was
saying
so the media within Twitter they're
saying well we can't know if it isn't
hacked and we don't want to run hacked
materials
and outside of Twitter they were saying
well it's not confirmed
it's not confirmed and of course they
were trying as hard as they could to not
confirm it
so I think I think it's clear that the
Democrats and Twitter colluded
illegally I don't know I don't know if
it was illegal but it's clear it's clear
that it happened
um
and there's no doubt about it right I
don't think anybody is questioning that
it happened
um now the the GOP Congress the new
incoming
majority there in the house uh wants to
investigate the hunter laptop stuff and
there was a survey
and
um if you're new to this live stream
some of you are probably due to the
Lifesaver I'm going to do a
demonstration
to show you that the viewers of this
live stream on average are way smarter
than other people now watch this this is
without any prompting this is without
any prompting
how many people do you think answered
the poll
roughly you know let's say you see if
you can get it within let's say two uh
two points what percentage of the public
thinks the strongly disagrees with
Congress looking into the hunter laptop
story
it's 23 percent
now are you amazed
this is how smart my audience is
that almost every one of you guessed
within just two points
like you were all you were right on that
wow
I applaud you
I don't think the word genius
is overused in this case
you were all geniuses
all right um
now Biden Joe Biden ran on correct me if
I'm wrong I'll take a fact check on this
um now the Democrats have policies that
they promote that are different than the
Republicans but on top of that Biden was
primarily running not on policy would
you agree
Biden said he was running to get rid of
a liar
and somebody who um
who did the fine people
statement which was a hoax so now we
know for sure that Biden's primary
campaign promise that he would be the
honest one and he lied about the biggest
thing in the news
so we didn't get that and
then he was going to bring as a
president that would prevent us from
having the fine people hoax happening
again
but the fine people hoax was folks it
didn't ever happen it never happened
even once
so he read for president successfully
by being the biggest liar
and promising he wouldn't be a liar
and on the biggest hoax the country has
ever fallen for by the same The hoax you
know was supported by the same media
and and he got elected now how would you
feel about that if you were a Democrat
and you knew that the main two things he
promised you character-wise were
complete
total
how would you feel about it
probably pretty good because you got a
democrat in office
and yeah the guy pretending to be Rob
Reiner over here says he feels great
all right I guess you feel great
I have a uh observation and some pattern
recognition which is a little incomplete
let's see if you can fill in the blanks
for me
does it seem to you that the that lately
Democrats and Republicans they both lie
but it doesn't seem they lied
differently
have you noticed there's a quality
difference to the types of Lies
so so there are all kinds of Lies which
side uh leaves out information that
would change the context which side does
that
both
both right every polit no every
politician every politician leaves out
inconvenient stuff so that's one kind of
lie both of them do that
how about um hyperbole
hyperbole where you're taking something
that's true-ish but you're stretching it
they both do that right they both do
that Trump did plenty of it and
Republicans do it when they're blaming
you know January 6 and extremists and
stuff they they just extreme they
exaggerate so they all they all
exaggerate and they all lay down context
we're kind of used to that right
unfortunately we're used to it from both
sides
um
but how about uh imagining things that
didn't happen
which side is more likely to imagine
something
that didn't happen
now it's Republicans
everybody's saying Democrats because
you're you're all primed that was
Republicans Republicans believe more
conspiracy theories Republicans are
going to believe Q
you know they're going to believe more
conspiracy theories absolutely
now January 6
is is definitely an example of you know
some but uh that's more in the
exaggeration category January 6 was an
exaggeration not something just
completely made up just weirdly
extremely exaggerated
well I think so again I'm doing a fact
check because I haven't done any science
it seems to me
because I'm not a republican so I get
that that little bit of
you know lack of bias from not being on
a team it seems to me Republicans will
imagine things that didn't happen but
now here's the part you're going to
agree with which side makes up facts
that literally didn't happen at all just
a complete made out of nothing fact
which side does that Democrats yeah the
the Russia collusion was just completely
made up
the Russian disinformation hoax
completely made up
right the uh Trump wants you to drink
bleach Oaks well it was based on an
event but the event is not an
exaggeration from the event it's
completely made up
because the event was about light and
they changed into
bleach that's not an exaggeration
that's completely made up
the the fine people hoax is that an
exaggeration
no it's completely made up because he
literally said who he was talking about
and who he wasn't now you could disagree
with you know whether or not those
people were there but that was never the
question the question was not whether
Trump was right
that some fine people attended he
defined his terms he said I believe
there were
that's the end of it so that was a
completely made up hoax yeah somebody
somebody's saying 1619 was made up some
parts of it
now let me ask you this what kind of a
person if it were a person instead of a
party
what kind of person makes up a lie where
you're adding entirely new things that
didn't exist
because remember Q wasn't a lie it was
something that people believed well it
was a lie yeah but it wasn't coming from
the Republicans who was coming from Q
narcissists
narcissists narcissists do gaslighting
gaslighting is not just an ordinary lie
gaslighting is like like a big lie where
you're adding things that didn't exist
like whole characters that weren't in
the play like you're introducing a
character that wasn't even there
like that that's the gaslighting that's
the narcissist so it seems to me that
the Democrats have become a female
narcissist
the Republicans have become a
I don't know uh firemen or something
a cop uh it just feels like some some
like male Vibe on one side the other
side is a female Vibe they both have
their character flaws but they're
different ones
an abused spouse
Republicans are an abused spouse
laughs
oh that's interesting
all right
um
so the most interesting thing about this
Twitter takeover is that in my opinion
the Democrats can no longer do
gaslighting
they have to change the way they lie
because I think Twitter would penetrate
any lies that were just made up
right because the the Twitter would call
it out but if if you controlled Twitter
you could just make up stuff and nobody
would call you out or at least nobody
would see it
so what happens if the Democrats
gaslighting engine is gone because I
think it is I think it's their
gaslighting engine
so we'll see how they do
um
all right let me ask you this question
now that you know that everything you
suspected about Twitter suppressing the
news was a hundred percent true
what do you think you'll find out if the
if the Republicans investigate the
laptop
will they find out that everything you
suspected about Hunter Biden and the
laptop
it is foreign dealings was true
how many do you think it's going to be
exactly what you thought it was like no
surprises at all
I I think we all do
right well a few of you said no could be
some surprises my best guess is it is
exactly what it looks like now that
doesn't mean anybody's going to jail
I'm not sure there's a crime there
but it is exactly what it looks like
it's you know influence for money
there's no doubt about that now I don't
know if you will ever get to the point
where you could show that Joe Biden is
beholden to Ukraine or something like
that that's a whole different level but
I think we'll definitely find out that
everything you thought about trading
influence for money was exactly what you
thought exactly what you thought
yeah and probably nothing will happen
from it
all right
ladies and gentlemen
yesterday was probably one of the most
amazing days of news and revelation
but you know it's going to be completely
killed by the mainstream media right
it'll just be completely ignored
it's already happening and I think that
they can get away with it
it would be real interesting to wait a
month and then ask a Democrat on the
street what they know about this story
wouldn't that be interesting just wait a
month
and asked ask Republicans what they know
about the story just some basic facts
and then ask Democrats what they know
about the story they will not look the
same
but that's why I think Democrats had to
get off of Twitter
because they didn't want to see the
reality
you know there's definitely something to
wanting to remain in your illusion
because I've done it myself I'm doing it
right now
I'm completely aware that I've built an
illusion around myself
and I I live in it willingly
all right
um was there any other story that
mattered
do you think how true do you think it is
that Putin uh
fell down the stairs and himself
and he has cancer in Parkinson's how
true do you think that is because that
sounds like
that sounds like you crazy and
misinformation to me
yeah I give it 20 20 chance something
like that
now but here's another possibility the
other possibility is that our Intel
already knew how bad Putin was
one of the explanations for why we're
pushing Putin as hard as we are is that
he might not be at full power
like it could be that the Biden
Administration knows they're dealing
with a weak in Putin and this is the
time to to push him
could be and it could be that they'll
turn out to be right
could be yeah poop and Putin
yeah when poop and Putin becomes a thing
that's tough
uh Biden is weak too
well Biden might be weak but I feel like
there's some kind of a collective
you know running the show that might not
be weak
we just don't know if it is
Putin
oh my God Putin's name actually has
starts with poo
Vladimir pooping
I think he just became Vladimir pooping
[Laughter]
you know away from the next like G20
let's say pooping gets uh invited to
another event
somebody's going to be walking up a set
of stairs right behind him
and like
you better let put Justin Trudeau behind
him right that's what I do if I were a
trump
I was walking up the stairs with the
other G20 people and I ended up behind
behind a Vladimir pooping I like reach
around and I'd grab
Justin chewed out I put him in front of
me as like a shield
you'd be my poop and shield
did I see Dr Drew's video on foot long
clots
uh I saw it existed
but what here's what I never want to see
one doctor telling you what he saw
right so I don't know if that's what Dr
Drew did but if if he talked to one
Doctor Who's Making some claims I don't
have any credibility on that that would
that would be the lowest level of
credibility
if you had two doctors who had different
opinions and looked at the same data and
then you had the bond and they talked it
out I might come up to an opinion but
I'm never going to form an opinion from
one person without the other side
doesn't mean he's wrong
doesn't mean he's wrong I'm just never
going to form an opinion on that kind of
information but it sounds interesting
I'd like to watch it
you already have a dozen doctors saying
they've seen clots so what's that worth
so now that let's say there's a dozen
doctors notable doctors high visibility
who are saying the same thing about the
long clots
and that and the value of that is what
still zero yeah The credibility of 12
notable doctors making the same claim is
still zero
you know why right
because it's still zero people on the
other side
How about if it's a hundred
a hundred doctors
they show you their work
they make their case it's all it's all
very it's all very convincing there's a
hundred of them and there's nobody
you've heard from on the other side so
how credible is that
zero zero
you should you should rank that as zero
because you haven't heard the other side
there you cannot you cannot ignore the
single most important rule of decision
making
here the other side
it's the it's number one there's nothing
that's more important than that
so if you've only heard one side that's
all you know that's all you know is that
one side said it's true
you don't know what's true
in that case are the Twitter files not
credible
well I'm talking about uh doctors
specifically
but you note that nobody is nobody's on
the other side of the Twitter files
like there's nobody and they could I
mean there's plenty of people who know
the Inside Story there's nobody saying
well you got that wrong
so I would expect you do expect
whistleblowers
um
50 notable people claimed the hunter
laptop was likely disinformation but we
also heard from the other side
by the way
does anybody remember me calling
 on the 50 Intel people
don't know if I did did I just report
that they said it or did I say it's
obviously
can you remind me all right so and
locals are saying that I called
on day one
I did right
okay and I I think I probably said it
because it was Brennan Brennan is the
one who said it was true and they
literally use him when they need to say
something that's not true
yeah I think I pointed out there was 50
professional Liars probably
yeah if Clapper and Brennan say it's
true you know it's not true because they
only bring them out to say things that
are not true that's their purpose
so how's my predicting looking lately
so I got
if I got the Intel guys right
and I guess that Jack Dorsey maybe
didn't know what was happening below the
hood and of course I was with all of you
predicting that the laptop thing was
exactly what it looked like so pretty
good so far on that anyway
um
all right pretty pretty good
um CNN did clever it cover it if you
click on U.S news so in other words the
CNN page let's do the app
yeah I I do believe that everything will
all the entities will cover it I think
that they will cover it differently and
some will hide it
all right
so here's the the CNN home page
starts with soccer okay I mean that's
happening at the moment
something about Moscow let's see
uh
see what's happening in Moscow FedEx
driver
James Brown mystery something about a
virus
uh
something about Trump
something about Trump's tax returns
something about Iran Venezuela Brazilian
football legend
Biden analysis
how far do I have to go
how far do I have to go before I get the
biggest story in the country
and we keep going rogue wave
so an on an Arctic Cruise it was a rogue
wave that killed an American woman on
the ship
I actually I actually did a
or not Antarctic
well
proud boys
proud boys want D.C police officer to
testify in their defense an upcoming
trial the proud boys want the police to
testify in their defense
that could be interesting
man fathers over 117 children
oh okay
and the guy who fell off the cruise ship
said he battled some sort of creature to
survive while stranded in the ocean
and New York City is hiring a ratzar
a rat Czar there's so many rats in New
York City that they need a ratzar
let me take a moment to give you some
valuable
dad advice
children
and some of you you can pass this along
to your children because this will be
good someday you may be in a place where
you have to decide where to live
you know you could decide to live in a
city or in the country or any City
when you're making that decision I would
like to add to your criteria
that if the city you're considering
moving to
has a rat czar
cross it off the list
that that actually should be the first
thing you should look for I know people
look for good schools and low crime and
a good commute but I would say razar
that needs to be the first part of the
checklist
ah should I go where I will be overrun
by rats
no
I'm going to say no to that do not go
where you will certainly be overrun with
rats
yeah so Baltimore is just totally off
the list
all right
we need that razar
did I hear that balenciago dropped his
lawsuit against its designer
so so how long has it been since we
found out who at balenciago
did that pedo related
visual stuff
and why
are you telling me we still don't know
why and who did it
here's another dog not barking
the person who got fired at balenciago
nobody
really nobody got fired
have you heard of anybody getting fired
nobody
[Laughter]
you should fire somebody just for the
look of it
right what are we looking at here is
this a new
uh
uh ocnn it's our job to go there
February 2007.
and tell the hard stories yes
all right
um
anything else going on
I think we're good
Trump was right about everything
Kim Kardashian needs to sever her ties
what would happen if if Trump retweeted
Matt taibi's
tweet thread and nothing else
pandemonium
pandemonium
that that is a really good idea if
there's anybody on the Trump team
listening
if Trump did one tweet and that's it and
that that was his goodbye to Twitter you
know he might come back if true social
doesn't work out but that would be
strong because then everybody would be
talking whether he was going to keep
tweeting you wouldn't be able to stop
talking about Trump and he would he
would insert himself in the story with
one tweet
that would be a good play so whoever
suggested that very strong very strong
suggestion I love that
not only tweet it but block the replies
oh that's even perfect that yeah I mean
I can't see Trump blocking replies but
that would be perfect
he's in contract yeah I don't believe
that uh
I don't believe that Trump can tweet
he probably has a contract that keeps
them on true social but I can imagine
him talking to whoever he has the
contract with and say how about I tweet
this and then I'll say see me a truth
social for more
uh and just use Twitter as his marketing
vehicle I mean that would be the way to
do it
all right
um
love that idea yeah
shecky Pavel I don't know who that is
does a liability for the Twitter laptop
thing transfer to the new owners there's
no liability
it's not a crime remember Twitter is a
private company they they could ban the
laptop if they wanted to the the
liability I think is the governments
am I wrong if if Twitter did this thing
which they did but they did it
because of the government it would be
the government who's in trouble not
Twitter because Twitter could just say
well if the government asked me to do
something
I don't say no to my government I think
that's a that's a get out of jail free
right if you say I was following
directions from my government even if it
wasn't a legal requirement
I would think that's a get out of jail
free completely I would think
you know even if it's just suggested by
the government it's not like a legal
mandate if your government says do it
I don't see any jury
seeing otherwise like not my country
in my country if the government forces
you to do something you don't go to jail
for doing that thing or there's no
penalty
uh
yeah the Liberals might Sue Twitter to
try to break it you're right
just following orders
all right by yeah Biden was not the
government but
um do you think the people on this team
were not operating as if they were a
government
yeah I mean those are interesting uh
interesting nuances whether the campaign
is really the government or it's a
pre-government that might matter
to the Supreme Court I can see that that
would matter
so I don't know how it would come out
yeah members of Congress were probably
involved because they were probably
working on this campaign with them but
we don't I don't know exactly who who
contacted who and how many times
I wonder what dershowitz will say that's
always a big question
Scott did Biden steal your defiant
America equals possible from your
defined America equals impossible
I don't recall that
so I don't know the reference so I don't
know the reference of what Biden did
when did Biden do that
and I don't know what I said that you
think might have
so I guess I don't know
all right just looking at your comments
here for a moment
you miss my cat
so do I I miss my cat
she was a a giant problem a giant
problem but boy do I miss him
yeah we got nothing here so I think
we're just hanging out at this point all
right YouTube I'm just saying goodbye to
you because say a little bit more to the
locals people thanks for joining
talk to you tomorrow
