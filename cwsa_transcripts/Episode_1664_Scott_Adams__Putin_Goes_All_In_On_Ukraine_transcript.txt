boom
well
today is not the best day in the world
especially if you happen to be in
ukraine
but we'll be talking about all that
and having the best day that we possibly
can
despite the bombs and missiles flying
and you know what would make you feel
safer
well i can only think of one thing
because you want to be safe on the
inside not just the outside
so if you want to fortify your defenses
on the inside all you need is a cup or a
micro glass a tankard chalice or steiner
canteen jugger flask
a huge
tank would be useful right now but
anyway any kind of vessel and fill it
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day and you
might need it today
it's called the simultaneous sip
and
despots around the world are afraid of
it and should be
join me now go
well
i think we're going to need a
going to need a stronger cup today
we have to take it up a notch
well we'll talk about it ukraine of
course but a couple other things here
uh rasmussen has poll says that uh
47 percent of likely republican voters
would choose trump as the candidate
uh they would most likely support
so
do you think trump's uh fortunes are
going up or down as ukraine is being
invaded
probably up right
because you're always more impressed by
the one who didn't make today's mistake
now i don't know that trump could have
done anything about this
and neither do you
but it's gonna feel like he could
right and that's what's gonna matter to
politics
you know would you agree with two things
there are two things i want you to agree
with
one is we couldn't possibly know what
would happen if a different president
did different stuff
it's unknowable
would you agree with the first part
that you don't really know if somebody
else would have done something
differently and if they did something
differently would you get a better
outcome you don't know
but if you could agree that with the
fact that it's a total unknown
would you also agree with the fact that
it sure feels like trump would have done
a better job
doesn't it
now of course that's a bias that people
would have if they were
republican or leaned right or whatever
or had any feelings about trump that
were positive whatsoever
but uh
we'll never know the real the reality of
it but it's gonna feel like
that
well the walls are closing in on trump
legally
oh wait no it turns out that
a spokesperson
for the manhattan prosecutors
they were investigating trump and his
company in a criminal probe they've
so so the top prosecutors
they were trying to prosecute trump in
this manhattan situation it's not his
only legal
situation i think it's one of one of
several
but uh the prosecutor just quit and the
rumor is that they thought there was no
case there
so
the walls are closing in
how many more phony
lawsuits are we going to see or phony
i don't know prosecutions
all right let's talk about ukraine
because it's the only thing you care
about today
uh number one
is there anything you would like to hear
more
than me saying my prediction was wrong
is there anybody who would like to enjoy
some schadenfreude
for those of you who correctly predicted
that putin would invade ukraine
would you enjoy a victory lap at my
expense
i think you've earned it
can we agree on that
can we agree you've earned it
so with my permission
enthusiastically i might say
could you please take a victory dance at
my expense in the comments
don't be kind
go hard
for the next
for the next well actually i'll tell you
what
for the remainder of this
um
the remainder of this livestream
i won't block or mute anybody
is that fair
so that way you'll feel
you know you can be as brutal as you
want you know part of the reason this um
this sort of public thinking if i can
call it that
where people like me say things in
public and then you react to them and we
see who's smarter
it requires a feedback loop
so when i'm wrong you need to climb all
over me and tell me how dumb and wrong i
am because that's
sort of a necessary part of the system
so
all right so
while in the comments uh if you like you
may continue uh verbally abusing me with
my
enthusiastic support
because if you were wrong
i'd probably mention it
don't you think
if i were right and you were wrong i'd
probably mention it so you could do the
same
all right
here's where i think i was wrong
if i were to analyze
um
well a few things number one i may be
addicted to contrarian
predictions
do you worry about that because you
should be
you should be this this would be the one
that even flags me
i go huh
i wonder if i got a little too addicted
to contrarian predictions because if you
get one right you get a lot of attention
right
and i'm thinking to myself this this
feels like that doesn't it
how many how many would say i should
worry about that
okay i should i should
now i don't believe that anybody is
capable of being unbiased in general
about this or any other topic we're a
biospecies
i feel like the best you can do
is to be conscious of where your biases
probably are
i don't know if you can go beyond that
like as a human capability
i think the best you can do is to say
you know
i could be biased but this is what it
feels like that's that's as honest as
you could be
right yeah the it's the rogue doctor
problem right that it's exactly the
rogue doctor problem that people do like
to be contrarians
it's a dick thing
i'll confess that it's totally addicting
now on top of that
here's at least
so that might be you know my
subconscious reason for being wrong
but on a conscious level
here's the assumption i made
that was completely inaccurate
the assumption is that putin wouldn't
have enough of let's say
an emotional
psychological need to do this
and that it was economics and that he
would do it for you know cold calculated
you know just sort of practical reasons
and i thought to myself you know this
doesn't look practical
and a a realist and a practical guy like
putin would take as many risks as he was
confident he could get away with but he
wouldn't take more than that
because he would act rationally
now there are two possibilities for why
he's doing something that in my naive
and
misinformed way
looks very impractical
to me what he's doing doesn't look
rational
but is it
what is it
and are any of us really rational so
here's here's the
i'm going to try to frame this in a way
that you can see putin's point of view
without supporting his point of view
can i do that can i do you think i can
slice this fine enough
to tell you what is the best version of
his point of view that explains events
but i'm not supporting it i'm just
explaining it
and the it would go like this
imagine if
ukraine had always been
ambiguously russia
and would you say that that's
true at least from the russian
perspective not from the ukrainian
perspective probably
but from the russian perspective
has it always been true that ukraine has
been
sort of russian
or sort of part of russia
probably yes
yes and
and putin has said so
directly right
now you can't trust what putin says
directly because he's managing
you know managing the narrative so he's
not he's not in the business of being
honest when it comes to this stuff or
anything else
but it does seem that the russian people
probably think there's some deep
connection there now
if ukraine and russia were simply
separate
countries could russia tolerate that
there's no other let's say there's no
other variable going on
the only variable is that well they're a
separate country we
we think we should be one but
it's a separate country
do you think that would be enough to
attack
um
maybe but
probably not
like there's not enough of a
psychological
impetus for that
right but now suppose
that that country that is supposed to be
or ambiguously is russian
decides to get a nato brand
and become part of nato
if you're in russia what do you think of
nato
it's just america right
do you think the russians think of nato
as really an alliance of equal countries
or something i don't think so they
probably just think it's you know the us
and great britain and
you know but mostly the u.s
i think they think that
so wouldn't it look like the united
states just planted its flag
in proxy
via nato
on russian soil
if you were russian
the threat
of nato of you know accepting ukraine
wouldn't it
feel like an invasion
wouldn't it feel like one
or like a pending invasion
now i'm not saying that nato would then
use ukraine as a launching pad to invade
russia that's crazy that's crazy
but it would look like they had already
conquered
ukraine
it would be like saying
the united states has a
right to be in ukraine
but russia doesn't
try to imagine that you're russian
put yourself in a russian mindset
that you think ukraine is basically sort
of a cousin
cousin-brother-ish country it's as
russian as almost as you are
it's as different as maybe you know
region within russia are different from
each other
it's not so much different
that it's not just sort of russia-ish
and suddenly your
your biggest national rival
plants his flag there
not literally
but if you see nato as basically a frog
for the united states
and and if nato
got his umbrella over ukraine you'd
expect the united states to have you
know deeper connections there
especially
now
when i describe it this way
and by the way
i've never seen the press in this
country describe it the way i have
and it only it took me honestly until
today
to sort of even be able to
imagine what it might look like
if you were russian
now i'm not saying they have the
preferred point of view or anything
right if you're joining late i'm not
supporting any particular point of view
i'm just describing them
people have very different points of
view now
and don't make it an analogy yet you
know if as soon as you make the
analogies to taiwan you end up you know
going down a complicated road that's not
going to help
if the only thing you knew about the
story
was it looked like a rival had planted
its flag on your territory
what you psychologically imagined to be
your territory
i could see a war breaking out
i could i could see you almost had to do
it
so
um i had thought from the uh even
as recently as yesterday i was thinking
now obviously by yesterday it looked
like the invasion was on
but i still thought there was a
possibility
that it was the world's best bluff
i also think
it still might be not exactly a bluff
but what would you call it if you're
trying to scare the other side into
surrendering
what's is that a bluff
what intimidate them into surrendering
because it looks like putin is trying to
tell them
oh a gambit would you call that gambit
uh okay
shock and awe
yeah
so
think of what russia did there so there
was this story that the russians had a
uh kill list
of ukrainian leaders that if or
critics or whatever and that if they got
control of ukraine they were just going
to line them up and kill them all
now don't you think that maybe russia
itself is the one who started that rumor
to get the the ukraine leaders to get on
a plane and get out of there
because if that happened then the
country would just fall without any
bloodshed
the the
the best outcome for putin would be that
he scares the ukrainian leadership into
leaving
and he's got to be close to that
if you were zelinski would you still be
there
i don't know that i would
i mean
literally they're saying they're going
to execute them
how would you like to wake up and be
zelinski and know that you might be one
week away from being executed
and not fun
not a good day right
yeah we had a we had a literal deck of
cards for iraq that's that's that's
right so it's not unrealistic to imagine
that russia did literally have a list a
kill list
but it is also
imaginable
that russia itself is the one that let
that get out
so that they would you know maybe escape
the country
i asked this question and google did not
give me a definitive answer but
don't you think there's a correlation
between the age of a leader
a despot let's say
and
their desire to go to war against a
neighboring country
doesn't it seem to you that it's a
war as a younger leaders
game
and that it's kind of unusual that
somebody in their 70s
would start a land or of this
magnitude now it's not impossible you
know i guess brezhnev went into
afghanistan when he was 70.
um
is putin i thought putin is actually in
the 70s now
can somebody give me a putin age update
i i swear i just read he was in his
early 70s that's not true
69
yeah okay
i wonder if we actually know his age do
you think we actually know his age
you know we might somebody says 73
yeah i'm seeing different uh estimates
here i wonder if we actually
don't know his actual age
because it's hard to find out about
stuff like that isn't it
well
but whether he's 69 or
73 i think the question holds
which is
what would make somebody that age do
something this risky
because it
generally is a younger person's game now
one of the things that one researcher
group of researchers tried to do i was
just looking at this online
is they tried to figure out if
if in fact there was a link and they
they did think that
their analysis found a link
that the older the leader the less
likely they would want to go to war
now other studies have the opposite
there or or that you know they didn't
find that correlation
but
one study said oh but we know uh they
got causation wrong so we did it in a
more clever way
by looking at
what doesn't matter how they did it but
um the point is that there's at least
one study
that says we're the only ones who did it
right
and it does show that the older you are
the less likely you're going to go to
war meaning as a
leader now
what would cause somebody who is
in that don't go to war
um
phase to go to war
now it could be that like i explained
that just this you know putting a nato
brand on
part of something that looked like
russia to russians
is just too far
yeah maybe the national identities just
couldn't handle it and putin as the
maybe keeper of the national pride
just couldn't take it it just was too
much that's possible that could be the
whole story really
and of course there's strategic benefits
that he would like to get as well
but what if what if
putin changed his meds
uh
in the comments tell me how many people
who are around 70
are not on some kind of med
that could potentially change their
personality
now i don't think he's on an ssri
do you think that there's any chance
that
putin
is um
on steroids
or
uh testosterone
do you think that putin knowing his
personality you know his shirtless
writing of
dragons and whatever else he's doing
knowing his personality for
ego
knowing that he's reaching an age in
which
his seven concubines per day might seem
like too much these days
and he feels like he's slowing down
don't you think
that he's talked to his russian doctors
about giving him
whatever is the best boost
a leader could get
and how about all those sleepless nights
that you you have to have even if you're
the one who's starting a war
don't you think if you're the one who's
starting a war
you've got some sleepless nights
because you know you've got a lot of
uncertainty there yourself
don't you think that maybe
putin asked his doctor about some
stimulants
maybe
they could be perfectly prescription
legal and approved stimulants
but
most of you who are watching this know
that a couple years ago
i documented
live
by living through it you know and then
doing live streams every day
how taking prednisone
changed my personality
and in real time i could feel it
happening
people could observe it
it was real
i had a different personality when i was
on prednisone
and that's just one example
you know i have a different personality
if i'm
you know doing anything
that has some prescription strength if
you know what i mean
so
do you think that part of this part of
what we're seeing
could be
a side effect of medication
because to me putin doesn't look like
the same guy i heard
dana perrino say this on the five
and some people agree
but i don't know if that's you know that
could also be bias
if he's acting differently maybe he just
looks differently because you imagine
that he looks differently so it could
totally be imagination
but i feel as if he just looks a little
different he looks darker
didn't putin used to be always laughing
now i know he's going to war so he can't
be in his laughy face now
but something looks like it changed
don't know what
but i'm going to guess medication
medication and or testosterone and or
all of it
but he looks like maybe a person who is
a a chemical experiment at this point
which is pretty dangerous
um
all right what else
here here are some more questions so
here's
putin's excuses that uh ukraine has
been
layering abuse and genocide
on
on i guess russian and ethnic people in
ukraine
and
do you think that's true
do you think that ukraine the government
of ukraine and ukraine forces have been
brutalizing um
the breakaway
separatist groups
i'm not saying that they should or
shouldn't because it's their country i
suppose they get to
fight their civil wars any way they want
but
do you think there's anything to it
is it is it a complete lie
or is there some
bad stuff going on there
something something tells me that you
know this is not a yes or no question
here
all right
um
and putin also said and this is very
clever
i i hate i hate to sound like trump but
yes this this is interesting he
announces his operation is to quote
demilitarize and denazify
ukraine
and promising to put his leaders on
trial so he's going to try to take the
narrative that ukraine is a nazi
infested
government
now i've seen that in social media over
here
but i discount it because i just
everybody gets called the nazis so i
think uh maybe
but doesn't i doubt it's the i doubt it
defines the government but maybe i don't
know
so
um
here's
here's the other possibility
if putin is a narcissist
one of the things narcissists always do
is projection
so because putin is acting like
uh hitler
the strongest thing he can do is to say
i'm going over there to fight hitler
it's projection oh no the other side is
hitler
i'm the
anti-hitler
don't you get it the other side is
hitler
so
if if all we're seeing is some putin
personality
problem
and he's just a narcissist
you would see exactly this
not just blaming them of his own unique
set of crimes
because he could make up something right
what's different about the narcissist is
that they blame you for their exact
their exact crime
their exact crime that's the weird part
the exactness of it
because it would just wouldn't it be
easier
if somebody accused him of being
healer
wouldn't it be easier for him to say no
no i have my reasons i'm liberating you
i'm a good guy
he doesn't have to accuse the other side
of being hitler but when you see that
that's a flag wait a minute
who does that
narcissist it's a personality trait it's
really baked in it's like a really
really you almost can't change it it's
such a baked in personality trait
the other thing is gaslighting have we
seen any of that well that's all it was
the entire
the entire russian approach to the
pre-war was nothing but gaslighting no
that's not happening ha invasion
i don't even know what you're talking
about
maybe you should see somebody about your
mental problems
if you really think we're gonna invade
so in a way
in the sense that russia is really just
a reflection of putin
that what the country does is basically
what his personality is causing it to do
you're seeing the country act like a
narcissist
now what about this overconfidence
russia seems pretty confident that they
can get this done without
suffering
a cost that wouldn't make it worth it
well narcissists are overconfident
so
he seems to be
having a narcissistic
sort of accelerated
experience which i would bet is based on
testosterone plus
a stimulant of some kind
a meth-like stimulant
and that those two things when you put
them together with his natural
personality
makes him think that a land war with his
neighbor is a good idea if he's been
insulted
especially
especially if he's been insulted
and nato and ukraine is probably an
insult
so
wouldn't putin look weak if ukraine went
nato
he would look weak wouldn't he
so it was sort of a personal insult
that that nato was even considering
branding itself with ukraine
um
so let's say uk uh prime minister
so boris johnson says they're going to
be these massive economic sanctions that
will hobble the economy does anybody
believe the sanctions will work
i i feel like the sanctions are what you
do when
you've already decided to lose
at least in
this context
you know maybe there's some context
where it makes sense but
doesn't it look like we've decided to
lose
and we're just going to take our gains
remember i told you that a lot of
russian public thinks that the united
states
was trying to trick
russia into attacking
because there'd be some benefit to the
united states
i wonder
if we haven't thought of it that way
because there is talk about
you know russia being bogged down in
ukraine and
obviously
american
energy companies should be able to sell
more stuff you know the natural gas
stuff especially so i would think it
would be good for american markets in
the long run stock market's taken a dump
today
and i would think it would be bad for
the russian economy in the long run
and that that's good for the united
states in the long run if we don't if we
don't spend too much money and i know
this is the
the coldest calculation
but unfortunately if we're just looking
at the economics and not the human cost
i'm not devaluing the human cost i'm
just
for an analysis sake let's look at them
separately
and
i don't know to me to me it looks like
russia is going to pay for this and it's
not going to be economically viable
so
i think the united states might come out
ahead
i think the united states might come out
ahead and i think we knew it
what do you think
i also wonder how does russia ever do a
deal with anybody
when you know it's not as if we didn't
know that they wouldn't keep their
international deals because we have some
history
it's not as if we didn't know russia
lies
and you could argue that all the
countries lie you know the united states
too
but
this this specific lie
is so in your face
it's so in your face
that i don't know how you can have
normal relationships with somebody like
this after that like how do you how do
you talk to a russian leader
like lavrov
how can anybody have a conversation with
lavrov and he says oh let me promise you
that the russians will not do acts
wouldn't you just laugh
i mean
lavrov i would laugh him off i would
laugh off lafroff
if i were a rapper i could make
something out of that let me tell you
you're going to see lavrov
not going to left off
kanye i need some help
i'll even call you yay
if you'll help my rhyme
all right
so um
i'm sure that the countries will just go
back to normal diplomatic relations it's
just mind-boggling that that's a thing i
guess people just act practically
now i'm saying that mitt romney is being
uh
revived in the
uh
at least in the left telling of things i
told you crystal is a
did a piece
on cnn in which he was saying well
romney was right when he said when he
was running against obama he said that
russia would be the biggest
foe
are you buying that
i don't see that at all
i don't see that
romney still looks wrong to me
all i see is russia taking care of a
specific piece of business that seems
very russian
i'm not
i'm not giving them cover
i'm just saying that this is such a
specific
kind of a threat
it's it's a sort of a russia on russian
crime
it's not exactly what i would call our
biggest threat
i mean
i don't think anybody really expects
that that the united states and russia
will get into a direct war about this
and all it does is look like russia just
degraded itself
economically and the united states did
not
i mean this looks like the opposite of
our biggest risk it's just a pain in the
ass at the moment there's no way this is
a bigger risk than china
are you kidding me
let me ask the question is
in the comments
i probably primed you too much but
tell me what is it which is the bigger
problem china or russia for the united
states
china or russia
in the comments
all right i'm seeing a wall of china
nothing but china on the locals platform
and then yeah china china china
so
the media is trying to convince us that
mitt romney got this right
and i think a hundred percent of you
watching this live stream don't you're
not buying any of that now partly
many of you may be
not the biggest mitt romney fans i think
that's probably part of it
all right
i asked in a twitter poll which has no
scientific basis whatsoever
will russia come out ahead economically
in the long run
and the last i checked maybe somebody
could check it for me quickly because
i'm doing this
but um it was roughly
one-third said yes russia will come out
ahead about a third said no and about a
third said could go either way now the
the numbers were bouncing all around
so they could have changed quite a bit
before i got on but generally speaking
the people answering this couldn't tell
if russia would come out ahead behind or
about the same
and does that sound
does it sound reasonable in the sense
that the wisdom of the crowd can't tell
now do you think do you think that
putin
has a stronger confidence than the
public that i polled because he would
have you know access to the best
information and he would know what
russia could do to get around sanctions
so he would have the most information
about this
do you think that russia
and putin
can look at this situation that they're
creating and say oh this will pay for
itself do you think he's confident of
that
because this gets back to is he did he
change his meds
because he could be confident of
something you shouldn't be confident of
that's that's where you get in trouble
um putin would be confident just on
principle right that's the problem isn't
it
uh we're already paying for it with
higher oil prices yeah
so
putin might also i wonder if putin is
already making a profit
because he's putting out the expense of
the military and there may be future
expense of deals he can't get done with
other countries
but at the moment the price of oil is
going up so much
doesn't he make a profit
and
we should be seeing a lot more on the
economic question shouldn't we
because i feel like at the very least
you could take each of these categories
and put some kind of estimate on it
so for example this this category would
be
the
the windfall profit that russia will
make
just from rising uh
energy prices
as a producer of energy
now
um would the prices also go up in russia
would the russian citizens be paying
more for energy
yes or no is that a controlled expense
maybe it's a controlled expense i don't
know
uh they're probably protected from that
aren't they i don't know
yeah killing the keystone pipeline
that's certainly part of it
all right
um i think the probable i'm gonna go
with the current estimate more because i
want the conversation to become
deeper i think the winners in this will
be china
see if you agree with my estimates on
the winners and the losers of this
ukraine action
i think the winner will be china
i think nato unity
will be greater
and i think
the united states might end up ahead
i think the united states might end up
ahead
but that's
uncertain at this point we're going to
eat some more inflation for sure
but i think it's going to
it's gonna cause us to get serious about
our our energy situation
now did you know this
um
i saw this in a matt ridley tweet
did you know that the head of uh
um
nato
uh anders uh fog rasmussen
said the russians as part of a
sophisticated disinformation operation
quote
engaged actively with the so-called
non-governmental organizations and
environmental organizations working
against shale gas
to maintain europe's dependence on
imported russian gas
wow
so russia put 95 million dollars into
these ngos these non-government
organizations
to persuade russia that shale gas
which would compete with the russian
product of gas
was too dangerous for a variety of
reasons bad for the environment and
stuff
now
do you think the shale gas
will be revived in europe because of
this
maybe i don't know
do you think
that greta tunberg
and the green movement in the united
states is completely free from russian
and or chinese influence
what are the odds that russia actively
tried to influence
european shale
and did not try to actively influence
the green movement in the united states
is there any chance
any chance that russia isn't trying to
make us go green as fast as we can
i'm pretty sure
russia is pro solar panels
for the united states
pretty sure
i'm pretty sure they're pro close down
pipelines in the united states
and we have to ask ourselves
how much of our american
economic policy is suspiciously close to
exactly what russia wants it to be
how how powerful is persuasion
well i estimated in an earlier live
stream that you could move if you even
if you didn't have complete control of
the internet in your country
even if the internet allowed people to
see different points of view
if you could control the media in your
country you could still convince half of
them of just about anything
anything
so
given that persuasion is that strong
that even with alternate sources of
truth and fact checking you can convince
50 of the public of
did i mention anything
just anything
apparently
and
why wouldn't russia
be actively supporting
efforts close down our own pipelines and
energy business it'd be crazy if they
weren't right
it'd be crazy
if it worked in europe why wouldn't it
work here
of course it would work
now do you remember when uh president
trump before he was president said that
uh climate change was a chinese hoax
do you remember when that sounded
ridiculous
and now we know that at least the shale
the shale gas part of climate change
was actually a hoax
literally
a misinformation campaign for economic
reasons for for russia in this case
now you don't think you don't think
china would do something like that
you think only russia would do a
disinformation campaign against a energy
source
i wasn't even
thomas edison who did a disinformation
campaign against tesla do i have my
do i remember my history wrong
that's a yes right even on our own
american history
edison did a total disinformation
campaign against tesla
which is why we have the types of
networks we have today
in part
yeah so
there's a long history of doing uh
persuasion campaigns against energy
sources that are the ones you're not
selling
uh fracking is ramping up on private
lands
is it good
i mean i think it's good i'm no expert
on fracking but from an economic
standpoint it's probably good
environmentally i have no idea
don't have an opinion
so
um and i guess uh
russia today runs an anti-fracking
program etc
so
i ask you this do you think that the
biden administration will break the
spell
which is will they realize that a lot of
what they're doing for
greta tunberg save the world purposes
may in fact be
largely driven
by first of all the public in the united
states but that the public in the united
states might be driven by russia
and china
and other misinformation campaigns
when do we wake up and say wait public
opinion in the united states is probably
artificial
because because that would be what
happened in europe in europe their
opinion about fracking was actually
artificial it wasn't actually their
opinion it was an assigned opinion that
half the people took
so
let's see
how does uh how does putin get
permission to travel internationally to
let's say democratic countries
after this
do we just act like it didn't happen
what the hell are we going to do
now
i don't have i'm not a historian but
could
hitler travel anywhere he wanted
let's say before well
yeah after the war started
after hitler started invading neighbors
could he travel anywhere he wanted
uh depends on the reason no i suppose if
you were going to go to negotiate a
ceasefire yes
but could he travel just to
do his propaganda and appear on 60
minutes and stuff
i don't think so right
so
i wonder about how much this matters
ima imagine being as powerful as putin
and having the the vast wealth of russia
at your disposal and the military
and you can't take a trip to some place
nice
the only place you can go is
china where you're going to be spied on
everywhere
your own country that you're kind of
tired of
and you just can't go anywhere fun
wouldn't that kind of suck
yeah imagine if the only the only
sanction that happened
was that putin isn't allowed to travel
into any other
country that supports nato or
and it just said you know you can't go
to brazil
i know you'd like to you just can't
you'd like to visit france because you
like the wine sorry
never again
you'll never go to france
united states nope nope new york city
nope
i don't know
how do we treat that and is there any
modern
can anybody think of a modern example
now of course
we have to explain how china
can have you know the uyghurs
you know
let's say cultural genocide but not
not murder genocide as far as we know
um
how did
how does that happen and uh president xi
can still
travel anywhere he wants right
it feels like it feels like that happens
somewhat gradually so it's different
you know it's the difference between
uh war starts today which is what putin
did like that feels like a slap in the
face
whereas the
anything in china feels like it's been
building up forever
so you just got used to it no matter how
much you don't like it you're like well
i don't know i haven't seen any pictures
i don't see anything exploding
yeah
i don't know
it's easier just to go on with your day
so
you know an invasion does look different
than some low-grade evil that's been you
know increasing over time
you said the same thing about kim jong
which which thing
i might have i don't know i don't know
what you're talking about exactly
all right uh why would he want to travel
good question
i think that uh putin is happiest when
he travels
what do you think
doesn't he travel a lot
i feel like every time i look up putin's
in a different country
now um
yeah
you're come i'm seeing a comment that
i'm mind-reading putin and
that is correct
but it is also correct that you have to
try to anticipate what people think in
order to know what you should do
so
we don't have the option of not trying
to guess what he's thinking it would be
mind reading if i told you i know what
he's thinking but i won't do that
i'm going to make a general comment
that somebody with a billion dollars
really really would hate
not being able to travel anywhere they
want
would you buy that
that basically anybody with that much
resources and power
would really hate it if they just
couldn't even visit certain countries
but on the other hand maybe when he
visits other countries he's just going
from hotel to plane anyway
and maybe he doesn't care at all
maybe the only place he's ever free
is in russia
because you know
he's safer there i guess
all right
let's see what else we got going on i
don't think there's much
yeah that's about it
um how many of you think that uh trump
would have done a better job
or let's say how many of you think that
trump would have prevented the invasion
of ukraine
in the comments how many think you would
i'm saying yeses
a lot of yeses some no's
um
i think so some think it would be
limited
yeses no doubt about it now how would
you have done that what
what mechanism would he have employed to
do that
here's what i think trump would have
done
first of all he would have just turned
up the uh
he just would have turned the knob on
our energy production and said
uh thank you for this windfall profit
uh this is the best thing that ever
happened to the american economy
um
you know we really wish you wouldn't do
this but if you're going to do it you're
handing us you're handing us europe as a
customer
if i were trump i would say you're
handing europe to us as a
as a future customer more of a customer
i guess
for our energy business
so i guess that's a bit
trump would at least have the credible
threat
that he's going to take your business
right and i don't think biden ever talks
about it that way because he's such a
traditional
politician
i think trump could threaten them
economically in a different way
trump could say look
you just made it impossible
for us to ever lose a bidding war
against you
you know you you'd have to really be
cheap
your energy would have to be awfully
cheap
before you're going to win a bidding war
against us in the future so we we
basically just took your gas business
it'll be a matter of time it's going to
take a while and we we have to use
tankers and stuff not pipelines but yeah
we're basically going to take that
business
russia has high cost of production
somebody says
maybe
how many people think that uh putin will
continue his uh aggression
is there is there an another next place
that's obvious
because it doesn't feel like poland is
at risk
i mean a nato country i don't think any
of the nato countries are at risk
now i saw a map i think maybe
maybe ian bremmer tweeted it i can't
remember who did
but i saw an animated map of the
increase in nato nations have you ever
seen this
see a map that shows over time
soviet influence so it starts with the
soviet union
well russian influence so it starts with
the soviet union and then you see over
time you know that all the satellite
countries are disappearing and then you
see nato that starts as a smaller entity
and it just starts swallowing up
countries that used to have russian
influence
if you were a russian and you saw that
map
it would look like nato is an offensive
force
because nato keeps essentially
taking new countries in a way
is swallowing them up
it would look aggressive to you if you
saw it on the map and you were russia
it would look like russia was shrinking
and nato was increasing
and this might be the final this might
have been the point
where putin just said you know
i i i can see poland
they don't even speak russian
but when you're talking about ukraine
ah
that's that's like just an insult
it's like it goes from
strategic things you don't like
to personal insult and i think that's
maybe what ukraine did i think it
crossed the line into personal insults
personal meaning not just putin
but almost personal to the
the russian
personality if you will
maddow has proof okay
uh nazis and kami's right
only the eastern part of ukraine speaks
uh russian yeah but realistically they
need to control it all
i mean while they're there
you know you could imagine that they
would say oh we only want the eastern
part and that would make their argument
stronger
but
as long as they're there why would they
let any of it potentially go to nato
he invaded georgia in 2008. now georgia
well all right let me reveal my
lack of
foreign experience
what language do the georgians speak
fact-check me what language do the
georgians speak
georgian is a language right
but that would also i imagine speak
russian
for practical reasons
some russian but it there's a georgian
russian yeah
yeah i guess i don't know the background
of
georgia so much but i don't think that
there's anything that's you know
arguably russian left is there
i i can certainly see them trying to
swallow up everything that's arguably
russian
and then belarus what is the language
they speak in belarus
belarusian
is there is there a national belarus is
it all russian
okay well i guess we're all getting a
lesson on that part of the country
guess what topic i didn't mention today
yeah you know
yep there's a big old topic
big old topic i didn't mention today
doesn't that feel good
i can't give you good news about ukraine
i can't do it
but if you've been keeping track
today is the first day
in two years
that a certain topic did not cross my
live stream
and that ladies and gentlemen
is a weird coincidence that we get this
new national problem or international
problem at the same time that the old
one seems to go away
coincidence
probably not
it's hard to launch a war during a
not gonna say it
i'm gonna i'm gonna quit now
i'm gonna quit now do you agree
this will be the time
all right youtube i'll see you tomorrow
you
