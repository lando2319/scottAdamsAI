what a day what a day
come on in come on in there's still time
still space
you can get the best seat if you hurry
up make sure your coffee is warm or your
beverage is
cold depending on your personal
preferences
unlike joe biden i think everybody is
different
i don't lump people by ethnicity no
i don't i believe we are all special and
different and unique
and i think that the only thing that
could make this morning better
well maybe not the only thing but the
thing that could make it the best
is the simultaneous step and you are
going to enjoy that
now and all it takes is a copper marker
glass attacker challenger steiner
canteen chicken flask have a vessel of
any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure that
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
including the fake news it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
well i would like to share with you
something that made me so happy this
morning and i tweeted it so that you
could be
happy too there is a genre of
entertainment that i had never seen
before
that i really liked i mean
it just completely made my day and i and
i'll call it a genre
uh you're i i know you're going to say
to me scott scott scott
we've known about this forever why are
you the last to find out well that's
probably true
but here's the genre young black men
listening to let's call it just for
convenience uh
old white music that is awesome the
first one is these
two uh two black teens look uh
who look like the most fun two people
you'd ever know
uh listening to a phil collins song for
the first time
and it was that uh it was in the air
tonight i think
now here's the thing if if you've never
heard phil collins and yeah yeah yeah i
know you all have
your opinions some some people love them
some people hate them
i personally think that his best songs
are amazing
and watching so
so the video is the the two young black
kids
and for some reason the fact that
they're black helps the story
right yeah you get that right just
because they're listening to something
that they had not been exposed to before
and here's what makes it amazing so
first of all just watching them
uh light up and enjoy the music and
being maybe a little bit surprised by it
is good so that alone is entertaining
but here's the part that really sort of
got to me
music for me is a sympathetic
um a sympathetic
thing and and what i mean is this
the music that i first heard when i was
with my
college friends is the music that always
reaches me the most and probably always
will and it has to do with the fact that
i'm
i learned very early that i don't seem
to have
much in the way of independent musical
preferences
you know i'm not not a big music guy but
if you put me in the room with people
who really like the music that's playing
what i respond to is the other people so
if somebody else is getting like just a
massive pleasure
and a music i don't get it directly from
the music
but i get it from the person and then
the music seems to be what's working but
really it's the combination of the
the person's influence because humans
are mimics
you put us in a room with anything and
we will be more likely to mimic it
music probably more than most things is
mimickable
so when i watch this video and then
there's another one of a
uh let's see what's his name uh he goes
by
no life shack s-h-a-q on youtube it's a
huge account
a couple million followers and it's a uh
i don't know 20 something i'm guessing
black man who's listening to
various musics for the first time and
leonard skinner
leonard skinner is the one now there's
another thing here that's that's useful
and by the way this is this is
persuasion
is sort of the context here so i'm
talking about music
but it's not really about music it's
about how the persuasion works
and how we are mimics
but i'm working on this hypothesis
about what makes music work
and it's a really deep kind of
complicated
hard to understand thing there's there's
something in humans
where we're wired for some kind of a
beat
but what i felt when i was watching and
again it's important to the story and
where i'm going here
that the people in the videos were black
so two black yous and then a
20-something black guy
and i got to tell you that as
as they were enjoying the music and then
i started enjoying them
and then through them remembering how
much i like the music
you know from my youth
it is such a bonding experience
like i i feel like i'm already friends
with the people in the videos
never met them don't think ever well but
immediately i was bonded to them like if
i met them in the street
i would feel like it would be really
easy to get along with them like i would
already be connected somehow
and you know in our big you know world
full of conflict and protest
and such watching the power of music
pull people together makes me ask some
big questions
one of the questions is about the origin
of music
and the origin of dancing and i'm not
too proud
i'm not too proud to say that when i
watched
no life shaq literally he couldn't
he couldn't help himself but move when
he was listening to
leonard skinner i actually danced
i danced with him alone in my
uh in my studio office at 4
30 in the morning happier than you could
ever imagine
like just purely happy and
he did that for me so i would recommend
his
um his youtube it's no life
shack s-h-a-q quite amazing
now here's the other thing i wanted to
say about music
there's something that i'm just sort of
working on this as a hypothesis
curiosity is sort of a base
impulse for human beings and i've said
before that whenever you can
invoke curiosity let's say you're an
author or any kind of entertainer
curiosity will just bind people you know
whether you're giving a presentation at
work
whatever you're doing if you can inspire
curiosity people will stay around
and they'll wait because they kind of
need to know how things end
we're just built that way and music i
think does that
because music imagine if you would your
music was one beat
and you know where that was going to end
at the end of the song it would still
be it wouldn't matter how good that b
was because it bores you
there's no curiosity but the songs you
know that if they start
slow like leonard skinner does if you're
familiar with the song you know it
brown it's actually too slow
and watching and watching the the no
chat no life shack
hear here for the first time what you
know as an audience member
is oh the good stuff's coming and here's
the fun
at the slow part he got really excited
and really liked
the leonard skinner it was free bird
actually so it was free bird
the song and he's listening to it he
really likes the slope art it's like yes
and you can tell he's really getting
into it and genuinely enjoying it
but as a viewer you're saying to see to
yourself oh
i know where this is going i am not
leaving
i am not leaving this video until this
until the tempo change right and so the
tempo changes and he just goes nuts
but you can feel it in your body like
you get goosebumps
and it just goes right through you
because you're you're feeling it with
him
it's remarkable and i would go so far as
to say
that if you are going to invent a new
genre of entertainment
damn you couldn't beat this because it
really has just all of the elements in
it
um so there's that i tweeted both of
those so you can
enjoy them too i would definitely
recommend
that you watch them alone watch it alone
with headphones
when nobody's watching because you're
going to find yourself dancing around
all right good news on the payroll
and on jobs jobs are down from 11.1 in
june to 10.2
is 10.2 good or bad well it's bad in
normal times
but i have to say do you know where we
think back just a few months just a few
months ago
what were people talking about in terms
of unemployment
they were talking about 20
they were talking about uh depression
now if you're keeping track of who is
your better predictors
i would like to throw into the mix that
i did say
no it's not going to be a depression
yeah we are going to get out of this
and this 10 percent unemployment as bad
as it is
certainly you know among our biggest
challenges right now
it's not nearly as bad as it could have
been it's a lot closer to
what the optimists were saying than the
pessimists
so keep that in mind oh as well as long
as we're
as long as we're scoring things
to maintain my credibility well
as well as i can anyway i like to
confess when i get stuff wrong
so when i get stuff wrong if i don't say
it publicly hey i got that wrong
then maybe you know i'll have less
credibility in the future
so early on when we first were going
into shutdown
and people said hey you know this
shutdown's bad and we thought it would
only be
maybe a month or six weeks when i
thought it would be really
short because nobody really knew i mean
maybe that was enough maybe it wasn't
but when we thought it would be short
i actually said you know i think the net
deaths
if you take out the number of people who
won't be dying on the highway
you might come out closer to like 5 000
people dead
if it's short but of course it wasn't
short
so my 5 000 dead could not be more wrong
so it's about as wrong as anything can
be
but the wrongness had to do with not
knowing how long the short the
the shutdown would have lasted because
not not a lot of people are gonna let's
say end their life or become addicts
in four weeks because you can sort of
last that out
you know maybe you could hold it would
be worse but not that much worse but if
you extend it for months and people lose
their jobs and
you know they can't they can't do any of
their social things that they normally
do
yeah that's that's expensive that's
dangerous
people don't get their cancer screenings
etc
so so that would be a case of me missing
by
about a thousand miles but the part i
missed
that maybe we all missed is how long we
would be shut down that was the key
key element all right though here's a
question
that i want to ask with respect which is
about the
church attendance during the pandemic
you've seen a number of people have
cleverly tried to get around the rules
i guess there was one church that did
their service inside of walmart
because walmart could be open but
churches cannot
i think it was ralph reed's group who
used a
casino to do a service because casinos
are open but churches are not
and i ask this question
what would jesus do because it feels
like
i've always appreciated that question
because
it does put you you know put you into
the view of okay if you were
jesus how would you play this
and the reason i ask the question it's
not a criticism so
don't take this as a criticism of
religion
i'm pro-religion i think it works
wonders in many people's lives
i think that's just objectively true so
no matter what you believe about
religion
it's just obvious it's good for people
we seem to be wired for it
the evidence is overwhelming i think so
i'm very very
pro-religion while not being a believer
personally
so i have a complete respect for it
for all the right reasons but i have to
ask
is your constitutional right to
to your religion which i would say is
unquestionable that is to say those
people who say you government
you can't tell us to not practice our
religion that's
that's baked into the constitution i'm
with you
same as if they had tried to suppress
your free speech
totally with you if it's in the
constitution
sorry those are the rules does it
you know is could somebody get hurt
because of it
yes sorry it's in the constitution
same with free speech free speech isn't
free
people do get hurt all the time but do i
think we should not have free speech
because somebody might get hurt by it
nope it's in the constitution those are
the rules we're playing by
and until somebody comes up with a
better set of rules or changes the rules
we're just better off saying hey this is
what we agreed on
let's stick with it so those people who
say it's my constitutional right
to express my religious preferences
and worship the way i want you know
within reason of course
i say absolutely 100
support for your constitutional right
to avoid to just ignore the government
literally just ignore the government
if the government passes a law tomorrow
that says you know we're going to shoot
you if you
practice your religion well you have to
overthrow the government
right i mean you have to overthrow the
government if they do that
so legally constitutionally
absolutely um and if you want to make
the
uh if you want to make the cost-benefit
decision
that you've looked at all the data and
you've decided that this risk
is worth the reward okay
you know as long as you've looked at all
the risks and all the reward
that's all anybody would ask but here's
the question
how would jesus play it would jesus have
said
let's say he made the decision and and
you said to him look we got
you know we got this problem we can't
worship the way we want to
but we got to work around we're going to
use the casino the only downside
the only downside is not the risk we're
taking on ourselves
because we're adults yeah we can take
our own risk
you know you can't tell me what risk i
can take so yeah
what do you think of that jesus and
jesus jesus would probably say
i agree you are adults and you can take
the risk
that you want but then there's this
other pesky problem which is
what happens if you transmit the virus
outside of your group
what happens if infections spread
because of it
and then that that went to people who
were not making any kind of a religious
decision
they were just cutting your hair or
whatever they were doing and now they've
got the virus
somebody dies would jesus say
go ahead and do the the ceremony
in the casino because you're adults and
you're choosing to do it and the
benefits
you know are greater than the cost or
would jesus say you know
the people who are going to suffer here
are not you
you know the the question of whether you
should do it isn't about you
it's not about you it's not about
religion it's not about your god
it's about what you what risk you are
willing to put
other people now would jesus say
well yeah maybe a few people will die
or would jesus say you know it's
temporary
let's just hold off you can worship it
up like crazy when the churches are
fully reopened
man we're gonna have a party it'll be
the best day ever
but for now but for now can you just
think of your other humans for a little
bit
now i'm not a religious scholar i will
not pretend to speak for jesus
i simply put that question out there
because i was raised
in the christian tradition and
i find it confusing that jesus
may have supported something that was
real fun and good for the worshipper but
might kill somebody who was minding
their own business later
maybe maybe jesus would take that view
and if that's your view that jesus would
back that
i would say you're on strong you're on
strong ground all right
rand paul tweeted a real clear politics
article by stacey rudin
who you need to know is a litigator
active in the grassroots movement
to preserve full-time in-classroom
education all right so
there's a lawyer who is actually
litigating
so she's i guess she is active
in uh in the the effort to get kids back
to school
and writes an article that says that
social distancing
and lockdowns have no scientific
support and i thought to myself
what so there's no scientific
evidence at all that lockdowns work
uh or that even social distancing which
is kind of the same thing
that they work now the the thought is
that if
you know once one percent of your
population is infected
that there's just nothing you can do
that you could be the most cautious
people in the world but
basically it's gonna get you it's gonna
get you sooner or later
however i would note that although the
argument is sound and very it's
provocative in the sense
that what is the argument against
hydroxychloroquine
the argument against hydroxychloroquine
is that
there are no studies confirming that it
works
right there are no studies confirming
that it works
so they say don't use it but there's
also no study confirming
that the lockdowns work you know in this
kind of situation
so who's being anti-science
if there's no evidence that something
works but you know for sure it'll
destroy your economy
do you do it there's no scientific
evidence that a lockdown
works and which i believe to be true
only because it would be so hard to do a
scientific study
and it might be the only reason there's
no scientific study because
that'll just be hard to study but
everybody thinks it works
and one of the things i loved was this
point that
rudin makes in the article that human
beings will
imagine that their leaders made the
difference this is a point i've been
talking about a lot
you think you can tell which leaders are
doing a good job because you're looking
at the outcomes
it's just not a thing it has never been
a thing it's not even a thing in
business most of the time
as the dilbert creator have been writing
about this forever
my observation in all my business
experience
is that managers would wait for
something lucky to happen
that nothing to do with them and they
then they would claim credit
based on that thing they did they had
nothing to do with anything
so most of management is waiting for
something good to happen on its own
and then figuring out a way that you can
claim credit for it
and that's not even a joke any anybody
who's had
experience with big companies knows yeah
in a big organization
it's really about saying that you are
responsible for
a coincidental uptick in in sales
which might have to do with you know
nothing let me ask you this
so we saw that a number of companies
like amazon
made tons of money because of the
pandemic do you think there are no
managers at amazon
who are going to say look at what a
great job i did because my
profits and my my segment are way up
yeah they will they had nothing to do
with it was the pandemic
the pandemic made people stay home and
order stuff on amazon
but there will be managers claiming
credit and
successfully they will be compensated
for doing such a great job
because well leave all those sales made
a lot of money
you guys are geniuses that have nothing
to do with talent
likewise when all the governors and the
leaders of all the countries
at the end of this they're going to be
claiming credit for the ones who
coincidentally got a good result
and and the ones who coincidentally got
a bad result will be blaming it on
somebody else because they need to do
that
but indeed there may be no connection
between getting back to the social
distancing between
any of the leadership decisions and what
happens now here's my
problem with the ruden
look while i accept that there may not
be any science
for social distancing and the lockdowns
that's probably just because it's hard
to study
almost nothing i do during the day has
any science to it
after i'm done here i'm going to go
downstairs and i'm going to eat
a delicious avocado with soy sauce and
pepper
despite the fact that there has not been
one
single scientific study to say that
that's going to be
the best thing i can do now might be
something else is better to do
maybe i should wait to eat maybe i
should eat something different
but i'm going to do it anyway despite
no scientific backing whatsoever
because some things just sort of make
sense now the other thing that rudin
admits is that uh you know if
obviously indirectly admits that if you
have a vaccine
and and you and you can stall until you
get to the vaccine
actually social social distancing might
make sense
it might make sense to stall if you knew
you were stalling for something
but we don't quite know that the
vaccines are going to work
i have a good feeling about them but i
don't know
so i think in the context where you have
a real chance of therapeutics
a real chance of keeping the hospitals
running
and a real chance of getting to a
vaccine and i think those are all real
that that is the one situation in which
you don't need that much science to do a
shutdown
so while the case is strong
counselor from a lawyer perspective
it's sort of a good argument but it's a
lawyer argument
meaning when i say it's a lawyer
argument i mean it sounds good
but is missing the biggest part which is
the whole point was to stall
to keep the hospitals open and to
make sure that we had time to get to
some better
treatments so under those conditions
actually i think you don't need too much
science to take your
to take your shot um
all right how about this
why is it that uh kanye west can't
debate
is it because he's black now
of course it's not because that it's
because they have rules and he is not he
doesn't have enough
doesn't have enough voters there's some
threshold that he's not going to be
anywhere near
but still wouldn't you like to see kanye
west debate
now even kanye says he's not running for
president he's walking
you know so he's signaling quite clearly
plus the number of states that he's
actually running in is limited
but he's signaling quite clearly that
he's in it for let's say the influence
or the positioning or maybe for the
message
but not so much in it to win still
what do you like to see him debate i
mean
come on can you imagine the ratings
for a debate that had kanye west
president trump
and joe biden it would be the best thing
you've ever seen
on television and would the public
benefit
from having a debate that drew more
people in
the drew drew in more people than
normally would watch
a political event yeah yeah i think it
would be actually
really really good for the republic now
the fact that there are these rules
about you know when and when they debate
i think that's independent of the fact
that i could just hold the debate
could i isn't it still a free country
could i'm not saying i'll do this but
can't i just say hey
i invite all three of you to my debate
it's going to be such and such a time
and if all three
you know they just have to say yes if
they said yes it's a debate it doesn't
matter if there was some threshold
that someone else cares about if if i'm
not a party to that decision i could
just have my own debate
so there's nothing that would stop it
except for the three people not wanting
to do it
now would kanye want to do it i don't
know
i don't know it'd be amazing if he did
would president trump say yes
if kanye said it said yes
i think so don't you don't you think
president trump would say yes
if kanye said you know he'll do one and
there was an event
that allowed it i think he'd say yes
i don't know would joe biden say yes
well
if kanye and trump said yes
i think his handlers would try to keep
him out of it
but it would be fascinating if he said
yes
anyway i'd like to put that in the mix
what's interesting is that kanye seems
to be doing
exactly exactly the smartest thing
because you don't need to be president
to have power
you just have to find a way that your
message
and your influence can get you leveraged
up so apparently he's
he's going to be on the ballot in
wisconsin
maybe you know the most important of the
swing states it could be
could turn out that way so he's finding
this little area
where if he can siphon off black votes
from democrats
he pretty much puts president trump into
office and i think he's largely admitted
that that if that happens that's okay
with him
yeah at least okay maybe better than
okay
but here's the thing he's now putting
himself in a position
where he could ask for something
right imagine imagine kanye west saying
look i'm on the ballot
i'm going to change the election if
you'd like that not to happen
i want one thing and then who knows what
the one thing is
if it were me i'd ask for something
about the
school choice i'd say look whoever gives
me
free competition and can fix education
for for everybody who's poor not just
black people because i think kanye would
be the one person who would say
how about helping all black how about
helping poor people
rather than just black poor people so i
think he would be a good woman for that
message
i imagined he would think of it that way
and
uh although i can't read his mind so i
don't i don't want to put it i don't
want to assume that i can imagine
what's in the mind of anybody much less
kanye right i mean if you could imagine
what was in his mind
then you would be able to do what he
could do but since you and i can't do
what he can do
let's assume we can't read his mind so
let's get away from that
um it'd be fascinating i'd just love to
see him
be part of the process and i think he
could be deeply
deeply important if he wants it to be
um let's talk about joe biden
joe biden um now obviously he's not a
racist
um i don't think anybody really could
make that case
but you can be insensitive you could
have a blind spot and you could
accidentally offend and i think that's
where he's at
so as you all know um
he made the statement that uh
that he thought that the latin american
was what was the name he used to work
the
latin american yeah the latino community
he said was incredibly diverse
and then he said quote unlike the black
community
so he's imagining that the latino
community is diverse
but the black community is not and when
he went on what to try to clarify that
because of course that caused the
backlash
he clarified that the latino community
you know it's not just mexico
but it's you know the south american
country is you know
guatemala etc and that that's what he
meant
to which i say um joe biden
you know africa is not one country right
in the same way that south america is
it's not one country
which was your point mexico is not
guatemala there
yeah there are some differences but you
know
africa wasn't one country
so and and of course the black community
like
every community is full of unique voices
so he's getting some pushback for that i
don't think he meant any harm
but it's a great political uh political
attack
and i think it gets more to his mental
competence
i mean the the way i read the story is
uh that he's not
verbally capable
which is different than having some kind
of racial animus i don't think he has
that
portland
portland has gone from i don't know
scary tragic it's always tragic
especially in people getting hurt
but it's also kind of funny
in a horrible way i'm not proud of it
because i'm not i don't want to minimize
the pain and suffering and the the real
you know the real hurt economically and
physically
for the the police as well as the
protesters so it's a real tragedy
but the ted wheeler gets rid of the feds
so that the mayor succeeds in getting
rid of the feds
which the story was the mainstream media
was trying to tell you
that the cause of the protest was that
trump had defense there
regarding just you know the federal
buildings and once they pulled out
didn't make a difference at all made no
difference
so now you can see that the mainstream
story about it was the feds that were
the problem
complete fake news but now the feds are
gone
so if you didn't like it you get to have
whatever is the opposite of that that's
what they have
so the mayor who at one point actually
joined in with protesters to show that
he
he felt sympathy or empathy for their
cause
that didn't work out well because the
protesters were not kind to him
but now he is he's he's saying this i'm
just going to read his quote
so ted wheeler mayor of portland he goes
don't think for a moment that you are if
you are participating in this activity
meaning the protest
you are not being a uh well actually the
not just the protest but the more
violent part of the protest
uh you are not being a prop for the
re-election campaign of donald trump
because you absolutely are
you are creating the b-roll film that
will be used in ads nationally
yes to help donald trump during this
campaign yes
if you don't want to be part of that
then don't show up oh well
oh well and watching the
the portland protest turn into a
campaign ad
for trump which is exactly what happened
not just approximately exactly what
happened
it literally transformed into a campaign
ad
for the other guy you can't
that is just too perfect it's just too
perfect
so on one hand
tragic on the other hand comedic
i guess that's all i need to say about
that
i tweeted today that i asked people if
they thought that the
teachers unions should pay reparations
because they are the primary cause let's
say cause of 80 percent
that would be my estimate of systemic
racism now they're not the initial cause
the initial cause you know you could
argue back to slavery and then the
ripple into the future but the ongoing
cause
you know the the current day thing you
could change because we can't go back to
the past
you know if we can't rewind history and
fix anything in slavery
but we can deal with what's today and
what's today
is that the primary cause of
every disparity income disparity and
everything else opportunity
would be the teachers unions now at this
point
and i have to admit i'm i'm very late to
this argument because the first time you
hear this
does it just sound stupid if you had
never heard this argument before
and and the first time you'd been
introduced to it
was me saying you know the teachers
unions are the cause of systemic racism
you'd say
ah i'm not connecting those dots
aren't those like completely different
things where are you going here
but anybody who's dug into it even a
little bit
learns that the teachers unions are
basically a political organization
who do a little bit of stuff for
teachers which gives them their
their power so they do do good work for
teachers in the sense that teachers
get good negotiating and union union
type strength that's all good
don't want to change don't want to
change the fact that teachers have
somebody who can negotiate for them
let's keep that part
but what you may not know is that the
teachers unions have
a tremendous amount of money because the
teachers pay into that
and i thought that that money went to
mostly doing stuff for the teachers
wouldn't you think
but it turns out it's political they
literally spend
depends on the union because they're
different unions but they could spend
30 to 40 50 percent of their entire
budget
uh fixing elections in other words
putting money
into you know especially the local
elections
where they have so much money they can
change who gets elected
so the teachers unions extort the
teachers
get this big pot of money maybe half of
it they spend on
union e stuff that's good for teachers
but maybe the other half
and we're talking all about lots of
millions of dollars here
goes directly into political campaigns
political activism
and not even directly related to
teaching
now now if you said to yourself that's
got of course they're putting money
into political stuff because every group
has an interest in what laws get passed
etcetera
i'm not talking about any of that i'm
talking about
general democrat policies for
just unrelated to school now as long as
the teachers unions
have money they can affect the political
process
and as long as they're affecting the
political process
one of the things that they're also
doing is guaranteeing that they
that they stay the way they are and the
way they are
is no competition for teachers so you
don't want
the union doesn't want the people that
are protecting the teachers
to have competition from another school
that might
you know lower the bargaining position
of the teachers that part actually makes
sense
makes perfect sense but it's also
just perfect sense for the teachers it's
not perfect sense for the union
it's not perfect sense for the republic
it's not a free market situation
and we know that competition and free
markets are really the only solution to
anything that doesn't work
if something doesn't work you've got to
be able to offer an
alternative and that's what this
teachers unions prevent
from happening because any politician
who who pushed
for school choice is going to get the
full weight of millions of dollars of
teachers union money
pushed against them in the next election
they'll get primaries and everything
else
so i would say that if you fixed
education
you would do the most that could be done
among the things that are actually
practical
it's the most you could do to fix the
situation
for the black community because good
education gets you
good income fixes everything better
health care outcomes
fewer people in jail and even if the
police stop you they're going to say oh
you know i've i've had only good
experiences
so it's basically the the alpha problem
and i would and i'm going to modestly
say that 80 percent of
ongoing systemic racism comes directly
from the school unions it's very direct
there's no indirect argument here it's
very direct
and uh maybe one percent
of the total problem in the black
community is police abuse
maybe one percent now i'm not saying
that
you know all police are good or that we
shouldn't work on that seems like a
pretty big problem
especially if if the problem of policing
uh affects you you know mentally and
emotionally it's a big problem
like i don't want to take away from how
big that problem is
but as big as it is it's about one
percent
of your total problem in the first
systemic racism
about 80 school unions is my
estimate all right um
here's one of those fake news situations
where the headline is up of this
opposite story and by the way i'm going
to get to the part where peter navarro
name-checked me on cnn yesterday
and and changed my whole day that's
covered up next
but there's a story uh uh it's one of
those uh
twitter things where they collect the
story and then they put the headline on
it
so here was the headline that
hydroxychloroquine is not effective
according to scientists so what does not
effective mean
well that's pretty clear right not
effective means
don't take it all right that's
completely clear
if a drug is not effective
do not take it under any conditions
because there's only a downside
but then you read the actual details
that this
headline alleges to summarize and the
headlines are
that it is unlikely to be effective
unlikely to be effective is the opposite
because what would be unlikely to be
effective
40 percent 40 chance
if there was a 40 which would be less
likely than
you know 60 so if there was a 40
chance it would work and it's completely
safe
as nothing's 100 but as safe as a drug
can be
and it's really cheap under those
specific conditions
you would take it so say that it's
unlikely
says you should take it as long as long
as the safety and the cost are just you
know
dead simple well-known not an issue
right so
you can see the fake news trying as hard
as they can
to turn well it might be worth a shot
talk to your doctor
no obviously talk to your doctors always
got to be in there
but not effective is opposite of
unlikely to be effective
in this situation journalists do they
know that
would a journalist know that they had
created a headline that was literally
opposite of the details of the story
i don't know if they would i don't know
if they would because they don't seem to
work
in terms of probability they seem to
work in terms of
it's true or it's not true all right
so after i got off periscope yesterday
some of you know this story if you
follow me on locals i gave you the
the sort of behind the scenes um
so yesterday i'm i'm just in my studio
right right where you see me and
you know i've been working doing
something else a few hours had passed
and i thought to myself you know
i'm going to fire up my computer and see
what the news is because you know me i
like to follow the news
so i think let's see what the news is
and i turn to my computer
i'm typing away and pull up the news
and i'm the news i'm like ugh
i want to watch the news i don't want to
be
the news don't make me the news and the
news was this
so aaron burnett on cnn was in a testy
exchange with peter navarro economics
adviser to
the white house the president and
navarro was trying to make his case
in the sort of risk management sort of
sense
but you know tv is very limiting
especially if the person you're with is
talking over you
so neither of them could quite say what
they wanted to say they're sort of on
top of each other and time was limited
etc
so toward the end navarro said
um and i will quote
so imagine me imagine me just looking at
the news and seeing this
if you've never had this experience it's
just so trippy because you feel like the
news should be separate from you
but then when you turn on the news oh
damn it it's me i i am the news today
and uh this is what navarro said he said
i reach out to
all your viewers scott adams you know
scott adams right
he's the guy who wrote the dilbert
cartoon he did a beautiful 10 minute
video on twitter
and the thesis of the videos that cnn
might be killing thousands
because of the way they've treated them
so i would just ask i'll let scott adams
video be
my defense on this now
if you thought that went over well
you have you haven't been following
things closely so
so aaron burnett says with an angry
look at her face uh can i just say
something
i find that to be offensive because he's
a comic strip writer said burnett
uh i just said that because i want to be
clear i just said that dr
fauci then she she said she wanted to
hear from the experts
now uh of course it took about five
minutes for the daily beast
to create a story that says navarro
uh you know refers to dilbert cartoonist
for hydroxychloroquine now think think
of that headline
that the white house refers to the
dilbert cartoonist
for their argument about
hydroxychloroquine
not so good right but it's okay because
obviously an article about a video would
have a link to the video
well i saw it's there today but i don't
think it was there yesterday maybe i
missed it
in the hill they treated it the similar
way and didn't link to the video
so not only did a story about
my video not talk about the video
at all but it didn't link to it in most
of the
uh most of the hit pieces that came out
immediately after
now what does that mean can you imagine
can you
even imagine that if i had said
something in that 10 minute video that
was crazy
is there any chance that wouldn't be a
headline
no because once the white house says
look at this
it sort of ties them to my presentation
you don't think that they would that cnn
and
the others who came out to marcus you
don't think that they would like to mock
what was in that video
don't you think that they'd like to say
and then he said
the craziest thing and here it is here's
the clip
of adam's being stupid no
no they all treated it as if i was
giving medical advice
do you think i gave medical advice well
i would say that i gave risk management
advice and that i broke down the
arguments for
and against hydroxychloroquine with
respect to experts on both sides
so i would say that what i did is what
aaron burnett does
right i'm not a doctor i'm simply
letting the public
know what doctors are saying that's what
aaron burnett was doing
she and i were doing the same job the
only difference is i did it way way
better
if you saw the video now
navarro his background is economics and
that's his job
my background is also economics i've you
know i've got an economics degree
in mba and i did financial analysis
and you know prediction models and stuff
for 16 years
at least i had a 16-year career much of
that was that stuff
so i'm not only you know completely
educated
in the right way to look at this stuff
but i have
a vast experience in it i mean a lot of
experience looking at
stuff like this and breaking it down to
what the argument is
and then just looking at the risk
management so what i presented of course
was not medical it was just
framing the argument and showing it as a
cost benefit
in which you should look at all the
costs and all the benefits and do a
you know a risk analysis a risk
management analysis but
was there anybody who covered the story
who said the white house economist
wanted you to see something written by
somebody who has a you know background
in exactly this stuff
that breaks down the argument there's no
medical you know
recommendation it just breaks down the
argument in a way that you can see what
the point is
did anybody report that no
no but and
i looked at my traffic and impressions
and it really looked like
uh there was something happening there i
i'm not going to make that accusation
yet but
it did look like there was a lot of
suppression now here's what uh
here's what navarro did completely right
and i've taught you this so many times
the
one of the keys well fifty percent of
persuasion i like to say
is getting your attention you can't
persuade somebody if they're paying
attention to something else
i mean i suppose you could cleverly but
it's you know not much of a thing
now and i've taught you that the way
president trump
um gets attention is what i call a
little bit
wrong so if you say something that you
want people to focus on but you insert
into it
something that is unambiguously going to
make people say oh that's wrong
i got a question about that part then
that's a home run
trump does it over and over and over
again which is why you can't turn away
everything he says you say i i know what
you're trying to make me think about
but why is that one thing bother me so
much it just feels non-standard i got to
look into this
and you've seen other people who are
good at persuading do the same thing you
see me do it
well you saw you just watched it today
with the
black lives matter question about
the teachers unions if you take the
teachers unions and just say oh they're
doing a bad job
people might pay attention or might not
but if i add to that
they should pay reparations what's that
do to your brain
the reparations part is the part you're
supposed to say that doesn't sound right
right and that's what binds you to the
topic it's the thing
the thing that i added that doesn't fit
that makes it perfect now that's
intentional in my case i designed my
message
to add the little bit of wrong right
into it and you saw that that's very
intentional very designed
you see mike cernovich do this you know
routinely
you know people who know how to persuade
will put a little bit of provocation
into it to just
lock your attention onto it when navarro
pointed to my video it was not only
a good summation of his argument so that
that part is just
good sense but because i'm the dilbert
cartoonist
you can't look away you can't look away
because that part's just wrong yeah uh
excuse me why is uh why is a comic
writer i guess that's what aaron burnett
called me
why does a comic writer talk about
you know u.s policy and medicine and uh
how does that make sense so it was that
bit of wrongness which guaranteed it
would be
stories on multiple fronts but the
fake news thwarted both of us it was an
excellent excellent play because what
should have happened
is it should have drawn attention to the
video people would go in with all the
wrong impressions about maybe i said
something medical
they would look at it and they'd say oh
this is actually just a pretty clean
breakdown of risk management
that's all it was and it should have
been this perfect moment
where everybody came in mad and found
out oh i was mad at the wrong thing this
is
this is just an argument
uh but instead the fake news suppressed
it
and gave headlines that are completely
misleading now i've talked before about
the uh
uh the uh the
the the the gel man effect
the gel man effect is uh he was a
physicist who noticed that when stories
about physics were there
he knew they were wrong but if there was
a story on some topic he was not
already an expert on he thought well
it's probably right
which of course doesn't make sense you
know statistically
probably the news in general is wrong
which would make more sense
now i experience this daily right
because there's always some story or
report about me
and i know if it's true or false but you
don't
you don't so when other people were
watching the story
they probably believed the headline they
probably believed that there was a crazy
cartoonist who was making medical advice
probably medical advice so anyway
if if i had the ability to be
embarrassed maybe i would be but
i just don't have it um and then here's
the here's the best part
so it's been a full day now or close to
a full day
and not one critic
who watched the video had a complaint
with it
do you hear that nobody who watched the
video
nobody so it was peter devaro pointing
to my video
and while his arguments were you know
they were attacking like crazy
and he says well you know look at this
video as like a summation of the
argument
nobody criticized it not a single point
not a sweeping generalization
nothing because there's nothing in it to
criticize
it doesn't really take a stand which is
much to disagree with it just
it just clarifies the existing risk
management decision
and then in the article in the the i
think it was the daily beast
and they were talking about navarro when
he
and they're they're quoting him and this
is an actual sentence
about a u.s official uh
in this country and this and they're
quoting him and they say quote
this is peter navarro let me tell you
why i got involved with this
he barked he barked
what kind of writing is that i'm pretty
sure he talked
let me say what this should have said
let me tell you why i got involved with
this
he said how about he said
because that's what happened i watched
it
it was it was there were words they came
out of his mouth
he talked he said it
did he bark it so
words like barked and botched and stuff
or how the fake news
takes no news at all and turns it into
something
so uh i might i was thinking about doing
a parody
fake news article in which you just use
uh insults instead of news because if
you think about the
the fake news mostly replaces the actual
news
with personal insults think about it
once you see that filter that news has
been replaced with
insults it's hard to unsee it because
that's basically what happened
insults get clicks news
maybe not all right
somebody says ezra pound botched
civilization
yeah botched and barked yeah they're
kind of similar
they're they're just such powerful words
uh all right yeah i need to do a robot
reason news again
uh i gotta get back to that
he mansplained it yeah yeah mansplain
does another one
you you can make something look dumb
just by saying instead of he explained
it
well he mansplained it it's like uh that
guy
all right slaughter butter is at a
hundred percent
um at the current time it is
hard to imagine any outcome except trump
winning
i mean um i have to admit in other
elections
i could imagine the future with a you
know a president
from other either party whichever
candidate
but i don't even have a like a vision of
what a
president biden would look like it's
just like this empty space
i literally can't even imagine it so
that might be
influencing my opinion but i saw a
teaser from
rasmussen this morning that the
president's approval was up
i think the president's approval is
going to continue improving i think the
economy will approve
will improve i think people will just
sort of get acclimated to whatever the
virus situation is
and i think that biden will continue to
decline
i heard there's a rumor that biden has
selected his vice president but we'll
wait to hear about that
now if it's kamala harris
i'll probably get on periscope as soon
as i see the announcement
if it's not well i'll wait until the
regular periscope and i'll say well
got that one wrong uh but if it's kabul
harris
you're gonna have to give it up for me
all right you're gonna have to give it
up because i i called her
as the head of the ticket as the nominee
in 2018
and stuck with it if she becomes the
vice president with the biden
administration
the candidate she's effectively the the
top candidate
and that would be my best prediction
ever
all right people are still saying it's
michelle obama and still saying it's
going to be hillary clinton
let me let me bet everything i have
that's not michelle obama
i will i will bet my entire net worth
and i will borrow
i will borrow money just to bet it's not
going to be
michelle you know she's the most popular
woman in the world i
understand but i i believe she has zero
intentions for
for that kind of a life all right that's
all i need and i will talk to you
tomorrow
