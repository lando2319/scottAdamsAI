turn your phones off
ringer's off okay you don't really have
to do that because it turns out
i wouldn't even be able to hear it if it
rang but you might hear mine so i'll
turn mine off
you know what you need today yeah let me
tell you what you need today
first of all this is going to be one of
the best days ever
not for any particular reason it just
is you don't need a reason all you need
is
a copper mug or glass a tanker
challenger steiner canteen jugger flask
of vessel of any kind
and fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
enjoy me now for the dopamine hit of the
day the
unparalleled pleasure the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and i
know you came here for it
join me now for that delight go
um
wow i guess the day going doesn't it
everything's starting to turn up look a
little better you
you started out a little bit slow today
but look how much better things are
already it happens quickly i saw today
that
the the company ring that makes the home
security
they have a new prototype of an indoor
drone
for security and apparently they'll be
they've already made it but they're not
selling it yet a little drone
that will pop up from its little
charging station
and do a predetermined route through the
air through your uh
your home and send you back pictures so
you can look at
look at what's going on now if that's
not cool
i guess i don't know what cool is
because
that got me all excited here's another
another little positive trend
that is unexpected positivity from the
coronavirus
tragedy hydroponic farms are doing great
i have a tiny tiny little investment in
a desktop
hydroponic company and their
their revenue just went crazy because of
coronavirus
and and what they make is uh it's called
click and grow if you're looking for it
and they make these little uh
desktop garden things that have their
own light source and
pods and seeds and stuff they're pretty
cool but apparently the
the full-size farms hydroponic farms
just went from well that's a good idea
i suppose you could make an indoor farm
if you really needed to
it it apparently has completely shifted
off to
we need some hydroponic farms because if
our food source gets cut off
like it sort of almost did with
coronavirus
we need a backup plan and having local
hydroponic farms
is a pretty good way to go so that's
good news
there's some fake news about joe biden
today
of course he's the gaff maker so
when joe biden makes a joke
intentionally
in the context of so many gaffes
sometimes you can't tell
but this one is being reported as a
gaffe this was clearly him making a joke
in which he said in one of his zoom
appearances he said uh i got to the
senate 180 years ago
and uh the the trump campaign tweeted
that as a gaffe
i don't think it was a gaffe i i'm
willing to place a sizable bet
that even joe biden knows that he's less
than 180 years old
so i think he was he was just joking
about how long ago it was
but things are so crazy that it's
reported as well maybe
you know he's doing so poorly that
maybe maybe he doesn't know he's less
than 180 years old
maybe but i think that was a joke
here's the funniest tweet i saw
yesterday
and i'm gonna read you the punchline
before i read you the setup
that wouldn't make sense until you hear
it okay
and it's because it's the way i consumed
it because twitter shows the
shows the tweet the retweet message
before the thing that got retweeted
so i'm looking through the through the
twitter feed yesterday and i see a
ted cruz tweet and i did
and like you i don't know what he's
referring to yet
so just consume it the same the same way
i did he said
you know there are decaffeinated brands
on the market that are just as tasty
and i read that and i was like what
what what kind of message is that a
reply to
you know there are decaffeinated brands
on the market that are just as tasty
and then i read what he was retweeting
and it was elizabeth warren
and listen to this word salad that she
tweeted
this sleazy supreme court double dealing
is the last
gasp of a corrupt republican leadership
numb to its own hypocrisy
the last gasp of the billionaire-fueled
party
that's undemocratically over-represented
and desperately clinging to power
in order to impose its extremist agenda
ted cruz you know there are
decaffeinated brands on the market that
are just as tasty
you have to admit that's one of the
all-time great tweets
here's some good news you know you're
all these protests are happening
and you're you're thinking to yourself
well what good is coming
out of all these protests you know you'd
like you'd like to think that with all
that disruption there's something good
coming out of it and i'm here to report
finally serious progress against
systemic racism and this comes courtesy
of the
uh of seattle so seattle has uh
voted in and approved the following
changes
thank god because our the long nightmare
of systemic racism
is finally coming to a close at least in
seattle
i would imagine a lot of places are
going to copy this model
because once you hear it what they've
done to eliminate
systemic racism you're going to say to
yourself
it's obvious once you hear it until you
hear it
you say to yourself i don't know it
feels like such a big problem
i don't even know where to begin but
once you see what seattle's done
you're going to be slapping yourself in
the head and saying why
did we not do this before why so here's
the three things they've done they've
eliminated the police unit that clears
homeless camps
now i think you know that if you
eliminate
friction for something it just stops
happening right
that's that's the seattle theory is if
they stop
clearing out these homeless camps things
should be good
now some people are going to say i know
critics are going to say
scott if you stop clearing out the
homeless camps
isn't the guaranteed effect of that to
attract
more homeless camps to which i say
i don't think you understand how
systemic racism works
you're you're in crazy land
no if you stop clearing the homeless
camps
systemic racism goes away
you're thinking about how removing
obstacles will make more of something
happen such as
more homeless people will stream into
seattle because it's a good place to be
homeless
that's just crazy because this will get
rid of systemic
racism but it's not all you know if that
was all that would be
pretty amazing but there's more to it
second thing they've done is they've
agreed to cut the command to staff of
the police
pay they'll still be as many people on
the staff apparently
or it's a little bit little unclear but
it looks like that what they're doing is
mostly just
cutting the pay of the people who are in
charge of making things better
for police now i don't have to tell you
if you're a student of human nature that
one way to get a better result from
people
and if you really want them to work hard
and and give you a good performance
cutting their pay that's the way to go
so these command staff police officers
were being asked to do more with less
they've also been asked to cut their pay
and i think that should motivate them in
the right direction
obviously how else are you going to
motivate people other than cutting their
pay
that just feels obvious after they do it
you know until they did this
honestly i feel dumb but i wouldn't have
even
thought of this you know i might have
thought of the
this is how dumb i am i i would have
thought you know if you want more out of
these people
to do a better job better cha better
training of their staff etc
i would be i would have been thinking in
terms of getting better people and
paying them more
to get more performance but i think
seattle's on the right track here
just cut their pay that should make them
work harder
and have better morale and so you should
get better results
then they're also going to reduce 100
officers
now if you want to make your city better
take the thing that holds it together
law and order and get rid of that
because the law and order was becoming
sort of a
trojan horse if you will for racism a
lot of people wouldn't realize that you
probably think to yourself
law and order wait a minute isn't that
good for black people
and white people and brown people and
people of all types
is there somebody for whom a an
active police force that is pursuing law
and order is there
is there some demographic group for whom
that's bad
well seattle has spoken and again these
are
these weren't obvious solutions if any
of this was obvious it would have been
done before right
you need you need sort of a out of the
box thinking you need some genius
and seattle has stepped up so the
reducing the number of police officers
cut the command staff bay and they got
rid of the unit
that is clearing the homeless camps so
those three steps i think are bold
i think they should be uh observed for
how effective they are
and probably in a few weeks the rest of
the country should go this way
because i can't imagine this not working
imagine
your black lives matter and you you hear
this announcement
and you think i'm out here every day i'm
protesting i'm trying to get rid of
systemic racism but nothing's happening
nothing's happening
why is nothing happening and then you
see this
and you say whoa i think i've over
performed i was trying to get rid of
systemic racism in seattle
but i may have done it in the whole
world because
once once these three ideas get out
there's nothing that's going to stop
them from spreading to all of the other
smart cities that also want to get rid
of systemic racism
so that's all good news you should be
pretty pretty happy about that
here's some more news
it's going to be harder and harder to
run against trump
and call him a racist number one
i love the fact that the organizer of
the
charlottesville finding people race is
endorsing joe biden
so joe biden's primary campaign
claim is that the the president's called
the racist and charlottesville fine
people
now of course that didn't happen that
was fake news
uh he he said exactly the opposite he
condemned them
but the organizer of the charlottesville
he uh he endorses uh joe biden for
president
so that's interesting at the same time
trump i forgot to mention this yesterday
but trump in his speech
explicitly said and i don't know if he
said this before
he said that school choice is the civil
rights issue of our time
in other words if you get school choice
right
then everybody's going to do better and
essentially that's
effectively a civil rights issue it's so
big and so important to the
black community
so that's a big deal have you ever had a
president who said
there's a gigantic civil rights issue
and i'm going to make it a top priority
to get rid of it what is
what is joe biden's big civil rights
issue
he has none because seattle already
solved it
this whole race systemic racism thing
used to be a topic that biden could talk
about but now seattle's kind of taking
it off the table
with their with their so effective
solution
but the president still is working on a
civil rights issue which is
education is terribly unfair and
poorly done so the president's done
prison reform he's
massively funded the historically black
colleges
we'll talk more about them there's a
biden story there
he's funded the opportunity zones he's
putting 500 billion dollars into
uh capital for black american businesses
he's
he's got black unemployment to the best
level it's ever been
before coronavirus it's coming back
already he's designated the kkk a
domestic terror group
even obama didn't do that i mean
seriously
obama didn't do that okay
he's the law and order president and by
a majority
the black population does like law and
order
surprise surprise
you're surprised that people like law
and order no matter who they are
it's amazing that that's a surprise all
right
but here's the other the other thing
that sort of snuck up on us
trump is the first u.s president to
nominate
a mother of black children to the
supreme court
he's the first one to nominate a mother
of black
children to the supreme court now i know
what you're
thinking you're thinking in terms of
diversity on the supreme court wouldn't
it be better
for an actual black woman with black
children
to be nominated yeah yeah okay
i see that point you know it would be a
little bit more on the nose
you know you'd say to yourself all right
that's exactly
you know that's the segment we we want
to fill in there
but i'd have to say
you know if you don't have that you know
the the more
ideal solution that everybody would
recognize is like oh okay
that would be good to get that kind of
diversity
i would think that a strong second place
is a woman who has black children
because i don't think the mom reflex
gets turned off
i mean i i've got a feeling that quite
legitimately
uh amy cody barrett feels that all of
her children
are awesome so having somebody on here
who has that sensibility let me let me
put this into a visual
persuasion when amy coney barrett
watched the george floyd you know a
shocking video of
of the moment of his death do you think
that she looked at it the same
as people who do not have black children
i'll bet not i'll bet the fact that she
has
black children you know changes her
filter
on seeing the george floyd situation to
make it
not exactly what a black citizen to this
country felt
i mean that's you know you can't really
feel what other people feel
but if you wanted to get close to it you
know if you wanted to get into the
the general zip code of that she's a
strong choice
it's a it's interesting to have somebody
who can who has one leg in each world
i mean she has one leg sort of you know
in the
in the parent of black uh kids
and one one leg in sort of a generic
white person world it's kind of a good
perspective
um you you've probably heard of
dr ibrahim kendi who's a
boston university mellon professor
professor
national book award winner best-selling
author and he wrote
had to be an anti-racist and recently so
he's a
sort of a public anti-racist advocate
uh he he recently made some news because
i guess jack dorsey
gave him uh gave his group i guess
10 million dollars unrestricted
money to help them work on
let's see how is it described
unqualified support of his vision of
putting
academic researchers at the forefront
of the movement to dismantle policies uh
supporting
racial inequality and injustice now what
do you think of the general idea
of having academic researchers at the
forefront
of how to dismantle racism
that's not bad i i would say you sort of
have to
see how it works out right everything's
an implementation
there's no such thing as just a good
idea you need a good idea that is
implemented well
but on the surface on the surface
don't you think that an academic
approach
to really understand as best we can
things such as are black people really
being targeted
by the police i i think we need the
researchers and the
scientists and stuff to sort of take the
the lead and tell us what's true what is
true
you know where can we identify this
stuff and where we can't
now of course you have the risk that
because they're academics it'll just all
be
and then you make policies that are
based on complete
so the execution matters right it could
be executed completely wrong
but in general if you have a real
academic who's got real credentials
and working with other academics and
they want to dig in to really understand
what's going on here with the the
systemic racism
not a bad way to go so he said something
that was so delightfully provocative
uh in a tweet that it made me like him
so i didn't know anything about him
until this tweet
and then then i started looking into it
and connecting the dots
and i'm going to say i have a positive
opinion of him
this may be different than some of your
opinions all right but i'll tell you why
the same thing that makes me like trump
is his provocative way of just going in
and shaking the box
because there are a lot of cases where
just going in and shaking things up
is exactly what you need it's you know
you don't write it out that way on paper
right
you know you don't make a plan i'm gonna
just shake everything up
but sometimes you need that here
so somebody made a tweet that's been
deleted now about
um it would be hard to make fun of amy
coney barrett
because she has two black adopted
children
from haiti and you think to yourself
okay
that's unassailable who could possibly
who could possibly complain about her
in terms of racism when she's gone so
far as to adopt
two kids from haiti so she's beyond
criticism right well not according to dr
abram and here's the part that made me
like him all right and i know you're not
going to have the same impression
but just just understand where i'm
coming from
that i like provocative people who shake
the box
they don't have to agree with me all
right so that's the part that you're
missing
i'm not agreeing with his positions
necessarily i might agree with some of
them i don't know
i'm just saying that i like i like how
provocative he is
here's what he tweeted about amy coney
barrett
he goes some white colonizers
quote adopted black children
they quote civilized these quote savage
children
in the quote superior ways of white
people
while using them as props in their
lifelong pictures of denial
while cutting the biological parents of
these children
out of the picture is a feminine of
humanity
now come on you have to you have to
appreciate
how wonderfully provocative that is
you can agree you disagree with it you
find it you find it offensive
i get that but just but just
agree with me on this point the way you
feel when you hear this has got to be
very similar to the way democrats feel
when they they look at a trump
tweet right it's going to look kind of
similar
you're going to hate it but you can't
look away
what if i told you about persuasion 50
percent of persuasion
is getting your attention one way to do
it and nobody's come up with a better
way to do it is to be
just so crazy provocative that people
can't look away
he has that he has that
so if you if you're tempted to dismiss
him
because you say i don't believe i don't
want you know i don't agree with any of
the things he's saying
i would give it another look because
there's
there's a whole lot of x factor that
comes out of this it just
sprays out of this the same kind of x
factor that an aoc
has same kind of x factor that a
president trump has
it just it's just coming out of his
pores
now once he gets all this attention
what's he do with it so here's the
second part right
now that he's got all this attention
being provocative
what's he do with it here's what he does
with it he follows it up
with this uh he says and whether this is
barrett
or not is not the point it is belief too
many white people have
if they have uh if they have or adopt a
child of color
then they can't be a racist so basically
he's making the point
by analogy that if you say you have a
black
friend that doesn't mean you're not a
racist
it just means you have a black friend
and he's extending that to say
just because you adopted a black child
that alone doesn't make you not a racist
it just means you did this one good
thing
so he's challenging that idea now is
that fair
is it fair for him to say that
uh that's not far enough like you know
you you need to go to the extra level
just having a black friend or a black
adoptee
not enough i think that's completely
fair
yeah that's a completely fair statement
it is also
a complete loser statement
here's why the difference between
winning and losing
strategies is that winning strategies
encourage
good things to happen more and losing
strategies
discourage good things from happening
more that's it
that's that's the whole tweet if i can
use that statement
and when when you see somebody adopting
a baby or babies from haiti
you know a white person adopting black
babies what is
the winner way to look at that the
winner way to look at that
is she's awesome that's it
as soon as you add something to okay
that's awesome
i i respect that 100 respect it and now
we're done talking about it
as soon as you depart it's just good and
you put that well it's not good you're
still
sort of a jerk you have you have put a
penalty
on good behavior good behavior
adopting um black orphans it's good
behavior
i think we'd all be happy about that but
he penalized it
a little bit right every time you
penalize
good behavior or support bad behavior
let's say violence and looting you are
in a loser strategy and there's no
there there's no real debate about this
there's no domain in the world there's
no there's no professional
coach there's no mentor there's nobody
who knows how the world works
who would say you should ever ever ever
put a penalty on good behavior
nor should you ever ever ever
say good things about the behavior you
don't want to see more of
it's very simple human nature that
people will do more of the things that
they get praised for and less of the
things they don't get praised for
so and i'm going to talk about this a
little bit more in a minute paul graham
famous
famous investor paul graham uh asked
this of a tweet he said uh
i wonder if the protesters in portland
et cetera realize
that roughly a hundred percent of the
effect they're having the protest that
is
on the upcoming presidential election is
to help
trump that's weird isn't it don't
don't you wonder why the protesters are
so
obviously helping trump because they're
playing right into his message
at the same time he would be their
biggest problem
the person they would most want to leave
how does that make sense
how does it make sense that every day
that they're putting lots of
personal risk and energy and money
into getting trump reelected how can you
explain that
here's how i explain it they need trump
to get re-elected
not all of them you know a lot of the
protesters are legitimately just
protesting
racism and and that's great but
in terms of the organizer class which
are really the ones that make it happen
right there most people are just
attendees most people are followers
there's a small group of people let's
call them the organizing class that make
it all happen
among the organizing class do they want
to overthrow the government or do they
want joe biden to be president
they want to overthrow the government
they don't want joe biden to be
president
you don't see the protesters calling
carrying joe biden signs
do you do you see any of the protesters
with biden signs you don't
because they don't want joe biden to win
do you know why because if joe biden
wins it takes the steam end of their
protests
takes the energy and of the revolution
the worst thing that could happen
from this perspective of black lives
matter is for joe biden to get elected
because the moment he gets elected the
the people who are
protesting are going to say we got
something you know we didn't get
everything we want
but at least now joe biden will head us
in the right direction and kamala harris
they'll be moving us toward a better
world thank god this
trump is gone they don't want that world
i'm pretty sure the organizers would
prefer
the perfect situation would be a
non-credible election
where trump wins and stays in office and
then they can complain that it was a
rigged election
it was not credible trump is still the
problem
nothing's been fixed we have to
overthrow the system
so watch for the protesters to be
very unenthusiastic about biden for
that reason dan bongino points out
that the that is
uh it's incredible that it's been
confirmed that the fbi used the
suspected
russian agent to spy on a trump campaign
and it's not a front page story
think about that just try to imagine
this
as not a front page story that the fbi
actually used a russian agent to spy on
the
suspected russian agent to spy on the
trump campaign
and it's just sort of ignored now
if you think you live in a world where
you form your own opinions
you know you look at the news you form
your own opinions you don't
that i don't know if that world ever
existed but it definitely doesn't exist
now
what happens is you are shown a a little
sliver of the news
that is designed to give you the opinion
that is being assigned to you
if they showed you more than the sliver
of news you might get too much context
and you would not accept the assigned
opinion because you might say well
i see your point but what about all this
other stuff
as long as they just leave out all the
other stuff
they can give you a sliver of reality
you'll say
looks good to me if i don't know
anything else i just know that sliver
my my opinion has been assigned to me i
accept it
um by the way on a uh
a more concerning note dan bongino
noted publicly that he's got some kind
of a lump on his neck
that seems to be a concern and maybe a
big concern we don't know yet so wishing
him the best on that
i i will add this story uh just if it
makes
dan feel any better in my 20s i had a
lump on my neck
went to my doctor at kaiser and they
said i don't know that looks
we better look into that we better get a
closer look
took an x-ray i go in and they and they
looked at the x-ray and they said
ah this doesn't look good and i said
well what does it mean if it's not
nothing which is the other alternative
they said it could be nothing
it could be just a they said one of
those things that was the actual
phrase it could be just one of those
things and
and we just drain this little bump and
there's nothing
that's it it could be it or or
you have a horrible cancerous
problem and your life will never be the
same
those are your two possibilities why
don't you come back next week and we'll
figure out which one it is
so i had to wait with a
basically you know almost a death
sentence
preliminary diagnosis of a lump on my
neck
i had to wait days to figure out what it
was
now it turns out that the the way to
confirm whether it was going to kill me
or not
and of course spoiler i i lived
they would stick a needle into it and
draw out the fluid
and if the fluid was blood i'm in big
trouble
because it means there's some cancer
going on there but
if it was a clear fluid it was just some
kind of minor infection
no big deal so i'm sitting there and i
can't see the needle because it's back
here
and i feel it go in and i feel the
liquid come out
and i'm sitting there thinking you
freaking
you see the liquid now you know
if i'm dead or i'm fine
tell me i had to actually ask
all right it still bothers me to this
day the moment it came out he should
have been saying ah no problem you're
all good
and it turns out it was no problem it
was all good
so dan i hope your situation goes like
mine did
i i have more empathy than you can
imagine
but i'm going to hope that it's just one
of those things and your everything's
fine
so i tweeted this yesterday i said i
know lots of people who wrote to success
on the strategy of skill acquisition
and positivity which is a pretty good
package package
if your life strategy is to continually
acquire
skills pretty good strategy and to
to approach life with positivity which
affects other people and affects
yourself
that's a pretty good strategy and i know
people have done that but i don't know
anybody who complained their way to
success
they might exist but if you have a
choice of those two things
either building skills and having a
positive attitude
or complaining and not doing anything
useful
um you know pick the one that works now
weirdly
elon musk tweeted a reply
so and a lot of people took note because
when elon musk tweets at me
people people think you guys need to
talk or something i don't know but for
some reason people get excited when
when that happens so elon musk tweeted
this and i'm not sure exactly how it
relates to
my tweet but he said there are times
when i feel like i'm living in a dilbert
cartoon
so i tweeted back the simulation doesn't
write itself
wait until you see what i have planned
for you and then you know
he laughed with some some emoticons
and
so anyway that that was fun uh and uh
ted cruz also retweeted me yesterday i
had a good day for getting retweeted
um did you think it was weird when
uh acb amy coney barrett
when she was giving her a sort of
nomination
acceptance speech i guess you'd call it
she
went to great lengths to describe her
husband as subservient to her
was that weird and i didn't understand
why until the analyst explained it to me
which was so people were criticizing
acb for being part of a a church group
that allegedly and i think this is
incorrect but the
the allegation was that the people in
that church
the women were taught by their religion
to be subservient to their husbands or
something
i think that's inaccurate i think that
it never taught that
i think it had to do with their use of
the word hand maidens but it was really
a biblical reference it wasn't
it wasn't a reference to subservience so
she goes in
and i didn't like this at all
honestly like it's the thing that felt
the creepiest
she she needed to describe her her
husband
as basically the house husband in the
group
the the one who is serving her needs
and although he's an attorney and has a
practice of his own
he seemed to be the primary caregiver
for the seven children
because her job was even more high
profile
and it seemed to me that she was sort of
suggesting that the way she could handle
an immense workload of being on the
supreme court
while having seven children is that her
husband was unusually
supportive in terms of raising the kids
and supportive of her
now i have of course i don't criticize
any couple
if they have a situation that works it's
not my
it's not my issue so if anybody has any
kind of arrangement
that makes them happy in their family
it's
great great to me but it felt
just uncomfortable that she threw her
husband under the bus
to help her nomination i didn't like it
i just didn't like it now i'm not i'm
not saying it wasn't an
accurate description and i'm not
entirely sure that the husband has any
problem with it he was probably
perfectly happy with it
but i don't know didn't feel right
didn't didn't love it but it probably
worked
um so what else is going on
so uh up in portland the proud boy
rally ended with no major clashes so
there were a number of
rests and there were a number of you
know people throwing stuff and
the usual amount of relatively low level
violence
uh enough so you could characterize it
as no major clashes
but here's the part i found interesting
so you knew that the proud boys were
going to show up
and you knew that there would be counter
protesters
here's the interesting part there were a
thousand people that showed up
with the proud boys the thousand
and there were 500 who showed up as the
counter protesters
now if you recall i've been asking for
some time
why is it that the news does not report
how many protesters there are at each of
these events
it's conspicuously missing the most
obvious thing that you would say about
any protest
is how many people showed up it is the
number one determinant
of how much i should care if six people
show up to a protest
i probably don't care if a thousand
people show up to a protest
you have my attention all right and it's
not reported
and it's it's
characteristically not reported and the
reason i thought that was important
not just in terms of news value is that
you might recall that i said the
following
if the rest of the country knew how many
protesters there were
it would allow them to send more
non-protesters into the area
and take care of it if you had enough
locals who were anti-protester
whatever that number of locals is you
could get enough of them
so they would so overwhelm the number of
protesters
they would effectively become the police
force in other words the
that the locals if they had enough could
just cause the protesters to
behave because it would be too much
muscle in the general area
because force is really the only thing
that changes anything in this world
and and here it is a thousand
proud boys showed up and and supporters
and
only 500 anti-fascists and the result
was
no major clashes why was there no major
clashes
well i would say it's because the proud
boys outnumbered
the anti-protesters right and it shows
you a model
that you know it's dangerous of course
because if you send lots of
you know people willing to fight into an
area
you know you've got some trouble but so
so let me say that this is not a
recommendation or a suggestion from me
about how to handle it rather i would
say it's one of several ways this could
end
you know there are several paths you
could predict you might go down
but one of the paths is that if the
police force
decides not to be the primary power in
the area and that's what they've decided
the police force has decided that they
will they will play for a tie
the police have decided that they're not
going to defeat the protesters
the protesters know they can't defeat
the police
they're both playing for a tie but
the proud boys were not playing for a
tie and in theory
you could bring in enough people who
just want the protest to stop
that the the sheer number of bodies of
the non-protesters would make it stop
there would just be too much power put
into the area
so that's one way it could happen it
could be that the citizens mobilize
in enough numbers that they just
overwhelm the protesters
and or there are enough people to make
sure looting doesn't happen
because really if you just had enough
kyle ridden house
the the problem with kyle rittenhouse
was now a kyle rittenhouse
the problem with kyle rittenhouse is
there were not enough
kyle ridden houses there if the kyle
written houses
had outnumbered the people who attacked
him and some of them ultimately got
shot two of them were killed if the kyle
riddenhausers had been the majority
instead of the lone ranger trying to
help things
it would have been different and it
probably would have been a lot less
violence here's something
interesting in election land pro-publica
that's a
publication election land propublica
they're reporting that in north carolina
so far this year i guess we're already
counting the absentee ballots
and already there are three times as
many
ballots from black citizens that are
rejected
compared to white now what's the first
thing you say about that
oh my god there there are discriminating
people
rejecting ballots because they're doing
three times as many black ones as white
but the story goes on to say that
there's no demographic information
on the ballots that are being rejected
and i'm thinking
but isn't there at least a name there's
a name on the ballot right
a printed name don't you know where the
ballot came from
am i wrong about that because that is
demographic information
it isn't too hard if you are a racist
to try to guess which names belong to
black people
you wouldn't get everyone but you could
get pretty close
couldn't you you know if you if you just
picked out the obvious ones
so i'm not sure i believe that you can't
tell
uh completely who voted
but the problems that they call out for
why they were being rejected
were missing a signature or missing
a witness signature
now that's pretty black and white right
there's either a signature or not
there's a witness your signature or not
what would be the reason that both in
2018 and now in 2020
three times as many black voters did not
fill in one of those two things what
causes that
do you have any idea what causes that if
i had to take a guess
i would say it's correlated with
educational levels
and that the the more educated you are
the more
adept you are at reading a forum
correctly filling it out correctly
and not making any mistakes so it
probably is just correlated with
economic
situation and and education
situation but it does
it does certainly raise the question
that trump has been raising
that these ballots are a problem
all right um
but i didn't know this that apparently
the system
this year allows the voters to they have
apparently they have time i don't know
if in every case but they would
have time to fix their errors because i
guess they get notified
now if they're notified of the errors
there must be some information on the
the ballot that tells you something
about people
so they can either fix it or they can go
vote in person
but as you might imagine not everybody
fixes it so the original problem
persists even though they could have
fixed it
all right so maybe that'll make a
difference we'll see
remember i asked you i said i couldn't
understand
why people were criticizing trump for
saying that doing
extra testing is surfacing extra
infections and i thought to myself how
could that not be true
how could you do extra testing without
finding extra people
feel feel like i feel like that's just
obvious and nay silver basically said
the same thing in the tweet he said
it's not clear whether covet cases are
actually on the rise in the us
or if it's because there's more testing
and i thought to myself
that's the first time i've seen anybody
who
i would imagine is more associated with
the left
i don't know if he he says that about
himself he may not
identify with the left i don't know but
it's the first time i've heard somebody
who wasn't
obviously a trump supporter say
yeah if you test more you're going to
find more infection
it seems sort of obvious and now
nay silver is saying it and i'm
wondering what am i missing
[Laughter]
what am i not understanding about this
situation that it could ever
not be true that more testing wouldn't
find more things
isn't the reason you test to find more
stuff
i'm really confused on that um
so i i asked by tweet today can someone
ask democratic leaders
including blm if they'll commit to a
peaceful continuation
of the trump administration if he wins
why is nobody asking democrats if they
will
commit to a peaceful transfer if trump
wins
isn't that a pretty obvious question for
democratic leadership of all type
here's another one and
why are democratic leaders not being
asked
by the press to disavow the domestic
terrorist organization
that is ironically called antifa now the
antifa has been designated
a domestic terror organization
isn't the obvious thing to ask democrat
leaders
do you disavow them now that they're
domestic terrorists
it's a good question it's the most
obvious question you should ask
and it's not being asked all right so
um a lot of people have asked me you
know what kind of
persuasion or linguistic kill shot
should you use against
the protesters uh that you think are
going too far
and sometimes you have to wait a little
bit and see how the public
is naturally responding to things and
then you find out how people are
naturally responding
you can design a linguistic kill shot
that
that plays to the thing they're already
thinking that's much easier
than just trying to make up some kind of
persuasion out of nothing
it really helps to know how people
already think about something
and now that a little time has gone by i
have this suggestion
for a linguistic kill shot on antifa
and you just heard me use it and it is
that the press should always refer to
them when describing antifa
they should be described as the domestic
terrorist
organization ironically named antifa
it's the ironically named that takes
their power away
because what antifa did that was super
clever
and has served them really well they
called themselves
anti-fascists even though they weren't
you know in a way that you would you
would consider it
um and therefore anybody who criticized
them
was calling themselves a fascist one of
the best things anybody ever did
in terms of persuasion so in order to
take the power out of that you could
simply refer to them
as the ironically named antifa
now you could feel it right
if you said that often enough and say
the domestic terrorist organization
ironically named antifa it would
completely take the power out of antifa
so that's my suggestion um
somebody found a video from 1991 in
which joe biden said
he was talking about a justice that
shooter i think that was being
considered at the time and talking about
how old people would be
in 2020 and biden said in the year 2020
i'll be dead and gone in all probability
now what are the odds that there would
be an actual video
of of joe biden predicting his own death
by 2020 at the exact same time
that we're all wondering if he'll live
to election day in 2020.
did he say that about lots of other
years
you know is there also a video of joe
biden saying
he might not live to 2025
or maybe it's something he says a lot
and you know they just found the one
that had the the 20 20 year in it
but that is very simulation a very very
simulationy
all right um
and there's another video of biden doing
a gaff
that that doesn't make any sense at all
and the gap is he he suddenly injects
somebody named john into his answer
and there is nobody named john involved
in any way with the question or the
answer
you have to hear that to know what's
going on but
i've now learned i've learned what
biden does when he loses his train of
thought
and it might be a trick i'll use myself
because i often lose my train of thought
when i'm doing these periscopes
probably i'm losing my mind what he does
is if he
if he starts into a point and he loses
his train of thought
he doesn't even know what the topic is
anymore he reverts
to this generic statement which is we
can't let
we can't let uh trump keep doing what
he's doing
because that fits everything so he'll be
like
we've got to change the economy and
check the change the taxes and then he
forgets completely what he's talking
about
he's like well here's the thing
we just can't let trump keep getting
away with what he's getting away with
so whenever he does that that means he
completely forgot what he was talking
about
so look for that all right um
some of you are thinking that it's
trump's middle name
donald john trump or that he was
thinking his name was
donald trump i don't know who he was
talking about
uh there's another tape that surfaced of
biden this is the trouble with being in
politics for so long
there are infinite number of old biden
tapes of him saying
bizarre things but jonathan turley was
writing about this today
he said that a tape has surfaced
of biden claiming back at some point
wasn't too long ago that he quote
started at a historically black
college
he actually claimed biden did
in front of a it looked like a
crowd of mostly black voters
he claimed that he had started out at a
historically black
college which it turns out
never happened as far as anybody can
tell and they don't even know what he
meant
you know they can't even figure out well
when he says he started out
does he mean he went to school there or
did or did he have some involvement with
them
it's just sort of bizarre and unstated
but the fact that you could have a
presidential candidate
claim that he or at least apparently
claim
this could be misinterpreted but
apparently claimed that he went to a
historically black college and nobody
and people just let that go
nothing to see here yeah he went to his
historically black college
why not why not
i tell you all the time and it's always
good to remember this
that the human brain is tuned toward
change
we get used to whatever our situation is
so even if something is really really
bad
if we do it long enough we stop
complaining about it so much because we
just get used to it
but if something is moving in the wrong
direction
even a little bit you our hair will be
on fire and we wow it's moving in the
wrong direction
so we're far more affected by the
direction of things
than where things are that's just a good
thing to understand
about human beings because that that
dynamic you'll see it all the time and
one of the ways that it's
really really important at the moment is
that apparently the
covid deaths in the united states
are kind of flat and as long as they
stay
about the same even though it's way too
high a thousand people a day or
something in that neighborhood are dying
even at a thousand deaths a day as long
as
it just sort of stays there and even if
the 200
000 deaths are now i don't know 200 4 or
5 000 deaths
as long as that stays around a few
hundred thousand
you know it might creep up to i don't
know 230
000 by election day or something
whatever it is as long as it's in that
200 000-ish range it's going to feel
like it didn't change much
and the fact that it seems stable-ish
is really really going to work for the
president because we can't stay
interested in things that are the same
even when they're bad
we get way more interested in what's on
fire today and what somebody said today
so i think the president's biggest you
know
problem is that what people think of
coronavirus
is becoming smaller and smaller in
people's minds
even though the problem isn't going away
i would say this about how to interpret
that the united states has such a bad
about outcome with coronavirus according
to the experts
i'm not convinced that if you looked at
all the variables it would look so bad
in other words if you considered our
obesity you considered a
higher percentage of african-american
citizens if you considered everything
probably wouldn't look so bad but we
don't
and i would say that one factor that we
don't count
enough is that americans just like
freedom
and americans like freedom more than
they like life
itself that's built into us we're
actually designed
that way to like freedom more than life
itself we're literally trained from
childhood at least my generation was i
don't think it happens anymore
but my generation was trained from
childhood
that if you had a choice of you know
you can't get freedom unless you die
trying to get it
we'll die so this coronavirus
is no different than every other
challenge the united states has faced
since its inception what's my trade-off
yes you could be much much safer if you
do the following things
or maybe you know i don't you could be
skeptical but
the experts are telling you you could be
much safer if you do these things
but to do these things you're gonna have
to give up this other thing called
freedom
do americans say sure sure
let's give up some freedom i'm in i'll
save some lives
no we don't do that and we don't want to
be those people
that's the bigger part in order for us
to have had
the same success as other countries we
would have to be like them
in other words the thing that killed
two hundred thousand people in this
country
this is going to sound really ugly but i
think you'll understand what i'm saying
the thing that killed over two hundred
thousand americans
to it to an extent is a feature
not a bug that's cruel
it's horrible it's a terror is an ugly
thought but
there is something that makes america a
little bit special
and it's this it's it's the fact that we
don't believe authority
it's the fact that we don't trust the
experts all the time
it's the fact that if you give us a
choice between living like a slave
uh and and being healthy or living like
a free person and maybe killing
your own grandmother you'll kill your
own grandmother
you will kill your grandmother for
freedom you kill yourself too
you kill anybody for freedom it's a
feature
it's a feature not a bug so
did president trump preside over a
country
that got a worse outcome than other
countries maybe
again i think you really have to dig
into the difference in the variables to
know that for sure
but let's say it's true
was it a mistake it's being couched as a
mistake
i would say it's a choice i would say
that the country
made a conscious choice now did
president trump
influence by his own behavior let's say
not wear a mask
let's say downplaying the virus did he
influence anybody's opinion
by his own actions perhaps so
perhaps so is that wrong
well if the way he's the way he's
persuading americans
is to be more american
it's a hard argument to make that it was
wrong unless you think
being more american in other words
preferring freedom over
life itself unless you think that's
a bug he was he was
persuading toward a feature not a bug
so that's just one way i'd frame it
all right um
there was a sign i saw at a protest at
yorba linda
so it looked like there were some
protesters and some counter-protesters
and one of the signs held up by it
looked like a white
counter protester to blm said
black behavior matters
so the response to black lives matter
from this counter-protester was black
behavior matters
pretty offensive isn't it it is
it's offensive now of course he made it
to be provocative
so you can't again that was a feature
not a bug
this is somebody who's trying to get
your blood boiling and it worked
i would say that strikes me as offensive
even though i agree with the thought the
thought i agree with completely
that people have to take responsibility
for themselves
even if somebody else caused the problem
so i agree with the thought but here's
how i would have said it better
instead of saying black behavior matters
i would have said black
strategy matters in fact if somebody
asked me if
black lives matter here's one way i
might answer
if somebody said scott say it say it
do black lives matter i'm not going to
be the jerk that says no
i'm not going to say the first thing out
of my mouth is not going to be
all lives matter because i'm not an
idiot
why would i cause trouble that doesn't
need to be caused here's how i might
handle it
absolutely black lives matter
super super true black lives matter
black lives matter
i might even put up my fist and scream
it
and then i would say would you agree
that black strategy matters
in other words that if you have a good
strategy you'll probably get a good
outcome
if you have a bad strategy you might
have a bad outcome would you agree with
that
because that's my problem my problem is
not
black lives matter because of course
they do duh
my problem is your strategy sucks
if you use a strategy that is guaranteed
to get you the wrong answer
don't blame me when you get the wrong
answer don't put it on me
when you're doing an objectively
obviously
clearly bad strategy that's not on me
you got to take that on yourself here's
here's a general rule that i think is a
good one
if you have somebody who's protesting or
wants some kind of change
and you've got other people who seem to
be the ones
who are in the way if one of those sides
says let's work together i'll do some
things differently
maybe you'll do some things differently
i acknowledge that the problem might not
be me
i mean i might not have caused the
problem we're trying to fix and maybe
you didn't cause the problem we're
trying to fix
but if you're not approaching this from
the perspective of both of us need to do
something differently
you are not really a credible player
if somebody comes to you and says only
you need to change
you'll never get there you can never get
there
if if you're starting assumption is that
one side needs to change
even if all the problems are on the
other side
the problem the the group that maybe
doesn't think it's their fault
still needs to say you know i don't
think we did anything wrong
but if you're willing to change i want
to do whatever i can to make it easy for
you to change
in other words i'll do something
different even though it's not my fault
it might not even be my responsibility
but
if you want to be productive both sides
every time have to say i'm going to do
something different
you need to do something different too
but we have to start with that
assumption
as soon as you say you need to do
something different
and i don't that's the end of the story
you can just walk away stop
i i want to tell you a story about that
but
i can't for privacy reasons but i have
been in that situation shall i say
in the past where it was expected that i
would only change and the other person
would not
and that can never work can't work
never negotiate with yourself all right
[Music]
millions of acres have burned in
california but
my air quality is good at the moment so
still keeping an eye on that
all right that's all i got for today
um all divorced men have been there
buddy
all right i guess you knew what i was
talking about didn't you
i didn't i didn't disguise that well at
all did i i'm gonna tell you the story
all right i'm gonna hope that my uh my
ex-wife will be okay with this
because i i don't want to i don't want
to do anything that's
uh too personal here but
uh toward the end of my my marriage
we did what marriage married people do
if they're having trouble we went to a
a counselor and i wanted to make sure
that i got the best
outcome from a marriage counselor so i
said you pick the marriage counselor
so this will be this will be my deal in
order for me to feel
like like you got the best shot i want
you alone
to decide who the marriage counselor is
because i was so confident
that my point of view would um would be
well
represented no matter who the marriage
counselor was
it really didn't matter who it was so
my ex-wife picked a woman as the
marriage counselor in which i said all
right this is perfect
because if a woman
agrees with anything i say it's going to
carry a little more weight
i think with my ex-wife so i thought
this is perfect
you picked a marriage counselor and it's
a woman
this is ideal because i'm pretty
persuasive right
have you ever met me i'm kind of
persuasive so i thought this is a
perfect setup i could i could not have
asked for a better situation
i think it was on probably day one
when the marriage counselor told me this
was the rule
that i had to change but my ex-wife did
not need to change
in any way whatsoever
how do you think it turned out
i i argued like like a wounded dog
i argued okay we got to change that
right
we can't even talk about any details
about you know what any issues are
we have to change that assumption
because if we go into it with the
assumption
that i'm the only one who needs to
change in any way
they can't possibly have a good outcome
and she could not be persuaded away from
that
she never changed her opinion that
independent of what the actual issues
were
i was the only one who needed to change
now i never really even understood it
and never understood it i didn't
understand why that
wasn't obviously the worst advice
anybody ever got anywhere in the history
of
advice but it happened
now how many how many of you had the
same situation
i won't wait for your answers but i know
there's a few of it
alright so that's the story and
i will talk to you later
