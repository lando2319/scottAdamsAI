good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization and if you'd like your
experience which will already be amazing
to go to levels that nobody could even
understand all you need is a copper
mugar glass a tanker chel or Stein a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dope me the
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now
go so
good
well would you like to hear all the
stories stories of the day that's why
you come here for the
stories oh I'm going to turn this device
upside down first
on the locals
people if you'd like to say hi to the
locals people they're right here they
will be on this iPad there we go much
better
now first story uh I saw a speech by V
Ramos Swami he's uh he's got some things
to say about Hamas you'd like to see the
top 100 Hamas leaders heads on Stak
as a message to the
rest to which I say
V
decaf just one word
decaf don't really need their heads on a
Stak too far dial it dial it back a
little bit just just about 10% heads off
of stakes but still dead still dead yes
we can all agree on that heads on Stakes
a little too far but I got to say you'll
never forget
it talk about visual visual
persuasion If This Were Trump what would
I say about
it I would say you cannot get the image
out of your head of heads on a steak and
number
two the only thing you'll remember is
that he was the toughest one on
humas that's all you
remember like you you won't take it too
seriously you'll just say w
you know that was stronger than anything
anybody else said and it was visual so
even though I have fun with it by saying
he should switch to decaf you're not
going to forget it if you if you hearded
at all you're not going to forget it so
that was pretty good uh pretty good
persuasion branding
there um Matthew Perry has tragically
passed away drowning in a hot tub um he
had a long history of uh drug and uh
drug and alcohol abuse it's hard to
imagine that's not part of the story but
we don't know um he he generally was not
the picture of Health um in his later
years he was 54 so that was pretty
pretty
alarming um I don't have anything to say
about that except it's terrible there's
not much to
add
um Scott Galloway
you know Scott Galloway so he was on um
Bill Mars and I may have mentioned this
but he he said that he was part of the
school board for his kids school I guess
and he was pushing hard for uh keeping
kids out of school social distancing and
he now says he was totally wrong about
that it was the wrong way to go but he
he asks uh that
people maybe have some Grace about
it because he was he was trying and
everybody was trying and then some of
them got it wrong and now he's saying I
tried tried to keep everybody safe got
it wrong now the reaction that most of
the people who believe they got it right
or would have gotten that right was
screw him you hurt our children you must
go to jail and pay for it forever I
disagree with all of you and I will
remind you that at the beginning the
very beginning of the pandemic there was
something I told you all which I'm going
to stay true
to I said there's a big old pandemic and
nobody knows what the right thing to do
is but unlike you and I there are people
who are going to have to make decisions
without knowing what's the right
decision when they make the wrong
decision and they will not all of them
will be right some will guess right some
will guess wrong we should not hold it
against them after the fact if later we
find out it was the wrong decision and
I'm going to stick to that so I think
everybody who says he should be punished
is wrong you you're all wrong in one
sense you're not wrong in terms of how
it feels you how how you feel about it
is simply up to you but in terms of a
system that you want to support you
don't want to start punishing people who
are well-meaning well educated well
informed
but got something wrong in the context
of nobody knew what was right now I also
said at the very beginning of the at the
pandemic I said we have basically a
bunch of binary decisions you know
vaccination yes or no lock down yes or
no so a lot of it is yes or no in these
yes or no decisions the thing you can
guarantee is that somebody will be right
and somebody will be wrong now you can't
guarantee that if there are millions of
solutions but if it's either yes or no
yes we do it yes no we don't you're
going to know at some point what was
right and you'll know some of it was
wrong so I think uh we should be a
little bit more
humble those of us who were right so if
you were right about
anything somebody was going to be right
because there were people on both sides
and everybody was operating without
complete
information so being right is nothing to
brag about honestly it really isn't
being wrong is nothing to feel bad about
the only thing I would have felt bad
about is people who didn't
try if you didn't try or you didn't you
know try to get informed or try to make
a difference well maybe maybe that
wasn't useful but if you
tried you're okay with
me and I do I do understand that the
outcome was horrible for children I get
it but I'm not going to tear the country
apart by going after people who are
smart and well-meaning and
tried that doesn't help who's that help
who who's better off for that so would
you like that the next time let me just
ask this question would you like the
next time there's an
emergency that all of the well meaning
well-educated you know people who are
very capable Scott Galloway is a very
capable adult right you want the very
capable adults to sit it out next time
cuz you're all if you're going
to be an to the people who
tried you're not going to get them to
try again so what do you want what do
you want for next time you want you want
everybody just shut the
up that all you do that that would be
better so next time there's an emergency
or something just everybody just take a
pass because you don't want to get in
trouble all right well I'm sure glad
that there are people like Scott
Galloway in the world he got that one
wrong he says he got it wrong move
on all right I'll take 10 of him over
anybody who is criticizing
him I'll take 10 of him over everybody
who's criticizing
him because the people criticizing are
not systems thinkers you're you're being
goal oriented the goal was to get it
right right the goal was to get it
right but sometimes you
don't the system the system is to let
the smart people do as well as they
can to make their best judgment learn
what you can from it and then maybe
adjust for the next
time but if your system is to punish
people who guessed
wrong that's a terrible system you're
just going to discourage people from TR
right so think about it in terms of a
system don't think of it in terms of a
binary oh I was right my enemies were
wrong which might be also true that you
were right and your your enemies are
wrong it doesn't help you how do that
help you not at all all right um flying
cars in Italy there's a company
companies making a product called the
Jetson one finally flying cars now it
doesn't fly that long I guess you have
to charge it for hours to get 10 minutes
but it's basically a bicycle that flies
you like it's this tiny little thing you
just sit in it it's got for propellers
like a drone it just
flies um for $100 somebody says do you
think a time will come when the rest of
the world looks at Israel and thinks
they're too great a liability to
continue to exist
no that wasn't really worth
$100 but thanks um no I don't think that
uh people will give up on
Israel um all
right
um as you know there have been many
claims made about the 2020 election but
nothing has been proven to my
satisfaction that there was anything
illegal that would have changed the
result but there's always drama and
there's fun I love I love what's
happening in
Maricopa so there's some kind of you
know extra checking I don't know if you
want to call it an audit or is it an
audit so there were some claims that
they're still looking into and the
claims are that there were 200,000
individual ballots that were printed on
some kind of unauthorized
paper which some would suggest was
intentional and or you know a sign of uh
some something illegal I'm not making
that claim I'm saying that is the claim
being
made uh but here's the fun part about I
I may have some of the details wrong so
give me a fact check on this my
understanding is that those ballots
still exist and they're in a room that's
locked
away and if we could get if if the
people who want to check it could get
access to the room literally just unlock
it and look at it that it would be
really easy to see it's not the right
Paper Stock that was the only Paper
Stock allowed for the
election and that would prove that
there's some big irregularity maybe then
you could you know look into it now it
could be they just ran out a paper or
somebody made a paper
mistake may maybe somebody didn't have
access to all the paper they needed and
you know got a second source and they
just didn't know anything's possible
right but I love the fact that just
maybe there's a room with a lock on the
door that unlocking the door could
answer all of your questions isn't that
just the greatest drama If Only They
just unlocked that door what back there
now if it's like every other Kraken it
will turn out not to be what you thought
it was or hoped it was or suspected it
was but I love the drama of it that they
exist they're behind the door and if you
could get the key in in a legal sense if
you could get the key we'll know what
happened I doubt that we'll actually
know what happened if we got the key but
it's a fun
story speaking of fun stories that are
actually bad uh my local da yam County
DA Pamela price she uh made the mistake
of parking her car in
Oakland do I need to finish the
story you you you could complete the
story without even knowing the rest of
the the story I'll just say the first
part again do we even I I'm not even
sure I'm going to tell you the rest of
the story cuz the one that's in your
head is so close to the real one close
enough yeah Alam County DA who is
allegedly one of the Soros type
Das uh she had a laptop she left in her
car and parked it in
Oakland well you know I'm not in the
habit of giving advice
about crime to local
Das but if I had a laptop and I had a
car I would not combine the laptop and
the car with
Oakland talk about asking for
it uh but of course she uh she got help
from the police who told her hey U she
should go online and make a
report if she didn't want to to wait for
an officer to arrive CU it make it might
take so long for a police officer to
arrive that they don't want her standing
on the streets in
Oakland would you uh you might want to
you might want to get out of there as
soon as possible because you're in
Oakland you know maybe online talk to us
online rather than wait for a cop we
don't know if we can get there in time
to save your
life anyway that's the news from walking
distance from my house well it would
take a long time to walk there but I
could do it I could do
it uh Germany is running out of Boomers
apparently Germany's employment
situation um is
terrible really somebody spending
another $100 to ask the the same
question again if you wouldn't mind
could you please explain why you don't
believe the rest of the world will
eventually consider Israel a
liability well who's the rest of the
world if you talk about the Christian
world they're too linked you know by
tradition and everything else so no the
Christian world isn't going to give up
on Israel and the let's say secular
secular people in Christian world's same
you know China doesn't care right so
it's basically you know the the pro
Palestinian types will always be against
them the the left will always be against
them the right will probably always be
for them but no I don't I don't see it
giving up now if you're asking would it
be
wise for the rest of the world to say
you're too much trouble doesn't matter
because it won't happen it doesn't
matter what's wise it it's sort of like
talking about should Israel you know
attack
Gaza
you could talk about it all day long but
it doesn't matter because they're going
to attack Gaza there's nothing you can
do about it
so there there's not much to talk about
I don't think there's any chance at all
that Israel will be abandoned by its
primary supporters I mean not if you're
talking
in 20 years to 50 years I don't see it
changing you know anything can change in
200 years but now I what what holds us
together is
psychology and the violence has never
changed the psychology that I can
remember right uh you know things have
been terrible things have been done to
Israel Israel's been accused of doing
terrible things
back you know who knows what to believe
about anything but doesn't seem to
change anything so I don't think this is
this will change much either all
right um so Germany's running out of
Boomers but just in time to replace them
with robots so I guess it's really hard
to get people in Germany to do skilled
work not enough of them and uh so robots
to the to the rescue I mean it blows my
mind that we're having a skilled worker
shortage in the world at exactly the
same
time well you must have too much money
but thank you uh
somebody's paying $100 this would be
$300 they paid but the $3 $100 is just a
thank
you so thank you I appreciate
that um but I would encourage the rest
of you the the super prompts are not
ideal for for the live format because
it's a little
distracting but I appreciate it I always
appreciate it but just in terms of the
flow of the thing better not to do them
a love your money though thank you all
right
um so let's talk about that main shooter
the uh guy who killed a bunch of people
in Maine but then he killed
himself um I've seen no no media reports
that there were two bullets in them that
seems to be just an internet rumor thing
so I've seen nothing that would suggest
there were two bullets in
them right that there's nobody actually
now
right yeah there's there's no credible
report of that so forget about
that um we still don't know where his
boat is why don't we know where his boat
is that was like a big part of the story
I'd love to know if they ever found his
boat I mean maybe you just put it at a
different Dock and there's nothing to it
but you kind of want to know that also
wasn't it rumored at one point that he
broke up with a girlfriend and we've
heard nothing from any girlfriend so I
think the girlfriend part was fake the
two bullets part was
fake um and then we're we also know that
the locals knew he was a shooter risk so
the locals actually knew it because he
you know there was enough there was
there were enough hints and suggestions
that the police actually went to his
house to try to find him and they were
not successful so I don't know if they
gave up because they couldn't figure out
where he was so they just thought well I
so I don't know what happened to that
but apparently there was somewhere in
the system they knew he was a risk and
they were looking for him so that's
interesting so um I think uh the odds
that we hear much more about that
situation seem
low
yeah yeah I I don't think it's likely
that it was anything exact except
exactly what it looks like it was
probably exactly what it looks like
crazy guy with a gun somebody suggested
that if he was a crazy paranoid paranoid
guy who heard voices that he may have
chosen the bowling alley in the bar that
he shot up because he imagined something
happened there like he imagined somebody
was talking about him or something so
could be that I don't
know it it still doesn't make sense why
he killed himself in a dumpster by his
old job
that that still doesn't quite make
sense so and yeah I still have lots of
questions about this but we'll
see all right here's a uh thought
experiment that I like to put out every
now and then to make everybody feel
bad it goes like this all right imagine
in a magical world so this is not
actually possible but imagine it were if
somebody could tell you knew the real
story like all the bad stuff behind the
scenes of every major entity and
political party uh in the United States
so you knew what really happened like
why why decisions were made and where
the money came from and who's getting
paid and who's corrupt and and all the
schemes that have tried before and all
the fake news around them suppose you
were taught that and you knew all the
bad history as well as what's happened
recently you knew all the bad things
about every part of our government and
every politician except there just be
one exception the only thing you
wouldn't know anything about more than
you already know is about our election
systems so you would be taught the full
level of deep corruption in every one of
our other systems but you would learn
nothing about an election
system what would you assume about the
election system
system pretty
good looking
good well that's pretty much the
situation that we're in right now so
even though we don't magically know
about all of our other systems we know
enough we know enough to know that there
are major members of Congress who are
not just maybe corrupt totally corrupt
just the way you thought it
right so while I don't believe that you
know Pizza gate was necessarily real
there there is some sense that there are
bad people doing Epstein Island things
for real there really is an Epstein
Island that was a real
place right so you don't have to know
every bad thing that happened with every
government entity and every important
person to know that anything that can be
corrupted
hello can you finish my
sentence anything that can be
corrupted who will be
right and there are still people who say
for
example um we know that there was no
corruption in 2020 because there were
lots of challenges and none of them you
know met the level that they would
change the election it turns out that
there were more successful challenges
than you remember if you subtract from
the challenges Kyle Becker did a good
thread on this if you subtract the
challenges that were um thrown out
because of standing and you could
question whether that was even
appropriate but standing means the
people bringing the suit were not the
ones who were specifically damaged by it
I guess or so so they didn't have the
standing to take it um or something like
that I mean that's the dumb guys
impression but of the ones that the
courts accepted and said okay you're
you're the appropriate person to bring
it we're the appropriate people to look
at
it um the uh prot Trump people won more
than they lost did you know that but
there were smaller there were smaller
improprieties they they didn't change
the whole picture they were just real
things that really
happened which does not by itself
doesn't say anything about any larger
attempt except that there are people
involved in elections who are willing to
do sketchy things and sometimes things
don't add
up
so I think it's
laughable to imagine that all of our
systems in the country are broken we are
completely aware of it but maybe not the
total depth of how broken they are
except for our election system
systems all good election
systems now which part of the uh which
court looked at the alleged 200,000
ballots in
Maricopa which one did
that none
right so so can you say for sure that
there was no
cheating when there are two 200,000
ballots sitting in a room that are
question
I suspect if I had to bet on
it I'd bet I'd bet that whatever is
beond that room doesn't change
anything because the smart bet is
against every claim which is different
from saying every claim is wrong I'm
just saying the smart bat is no probably
not a kraken probably not but it doesn't
mean there is no Kraken just means bet
against it if you have
to all right let's talk about the Middle
East a little bit um I was thinking
yesterday that the whole Middle East
situation looks like a murder
suicide
situation the only difference is we
can't decide who's the murderer and
who's the
suicide you think about it
is is Hamas a
suicide
situation
and you know they're they're def they're
trying to murder Israelis but it's a
suicide plan or is the existence of
Israel in the middle of all this
hate essentially a suicide thing and
Hamas is trying to murder them at the
same time so it just looks like it looks
like by design it couldn't possibly
work I mean it it's like somebody
created a situation that's guaranteed to
be terrible forever and then everybody
said all right I guess this is the best
we we can do this terrible situation
that can never be better it's a murder
suicide you know slow moving it's like a
slow motion murder
suicide anyway
um and I challenged people to
describe describe any scenario in which
it works out in the long
run in other words what's the scenario
where Israel finds something like the
peace that other countries enjoy
where their neighbors are not trying to
kill them all the
time What scenario would ever get you to
that
point the so the trends that we see are
the population is growing faster in the
countries that want to destroy Israel
Israel's you know geographically in the
middle of them so you've got a growing
population of haters you know even if
it's only a small population within the
larger population that wants to kill all
Israelis it's still growing because the
larger population is growing so whatever
percentage they are is growing as well
the
children at least in the the Palestinian
areas appear to be
weaponized meaning that they've been
taught that it's their you know sacred
duty to grow up and kill
Jews now I don't know what percentage of
them I don't know if it's 80% or 10% or
2% it's it's a little unclear if that's
Universal but I guess it is if I had to
guess i' i' guess it's closer to
Universal than not yeah it's probably
100% and how do you fix
that if today all the adults surrendered
and said oh hos didn't work sorry didn't
mean it we'll put down our guns you'd
have an entire
generation which is like half of the
entire population cu the young people
are about half of all the Palestinians
who would just replace them and while
they were replacing them as adults the
new children would be taught to be the
new Replacements of those adults so as
long as the education system is
weaponizing children there are more
children every day and then the power of
weapons a weapon that one individual
could use is getting stronger every day
right one person will be able to launch
a drone that does immense D damage
pretty soon if not already so under that
scenario what is the scenario in which
everything works out in the long
run can you even describe a world where
that
happens I can't think of anything can
you the
Rapture to me it always just looks like
buying
time you I mean I I think Israel is
going to be there for a while but how in
the world could it you know how how how
could it survive in the long run let me
put it another way somebody I I'll
borrow somebody's example for Israel to
survive it has to be able to
successfully repel every attempt to
destroy it
forever that would be what survival is
destroying every attempt to destroy it
but the people doing the
destroying themselves typically get
destroyed but they only have to be right
once so the math is really really bad
here Israel can be you know destroyed
the enemies 99 out of 100 times but the
enemy only has to get it right once and
Israel
disappears now we're not there
yet but did you see what happened when
they all just sort of ran toward
Israel individually got on their
motorcycles and their little uh par of
ples or whatever they were and it was
just a bunch of individuals who were
attacking to me that's always been the
big risk is the wave of individuals I
don't think the big risk is necessarily
missiles although it is a really really
big risk I don't know if the biggest
risk is necessarily nuclear because it's
hard to
imagine that anybody who's Islamic would
want to IR irradiate a a Holy Zone right
it's a holy land for both sides right so
I don't really see a
nuke that seems unlikely but if you just
get more and more people who are on that
captagon drug the drug where they can
hand you a rifle and say I've got an
idea want don't you run as fast as you
can into that hail of uh gunfire and see
how many people you can kill on the
other side yeah don't worry about the
harm yeah don't worry about anything
just run and shoot if you if you have
enough of them could they not
overrun basically any Israeli
city so you know and especially we saw
that the Israeli citizens are largely
unarmed so it would be you know same
kind of thing but bigger so I don't know
what stops it from happening in the
future um and I didn't see anybody who
could describe a scenario where it does
work I will say that from the
uh missile category you know if the
let's say hezb has got 200,000 pretty
good missiles at this point which should
be enough to take out a entire city I
would think and then some um but Israel
is also working on that you know laser
beam defense
weapon and I can't imagine anything else
that would work if that works because
there's no way you're going to shoot a
missile to block every incoming missile
because the bad guys will just have a
bunch of fake missiles they will make as
many fake missiles as it takes to
overwhelm your missile defense but if
your missile defense is lasers the
lasers are
just and take out the missiles as
quickly as they're launched so then
there's this fast missile launcher then
the bad guys adjust too they're like
okay we can't get a missile through
we'll uh
put it on the back of a motorcycle and a
bunch of us will just make a run at you
or something like that anyway it's
really difficult to
imagine where it all goes but it's I I
don't
know let me ask you this is there
any um parallel in history where there
was a little landlocked country
surrounded by people with bad
intentions who want to take it over
where it lasted in the long
run so taiwan's lasted a while but
there's no way that t Taiwan will always
be separate from
China
Poland yeah yeah
well okay landlocked
is
relative nuclear powered laser
satellites
yeah all right well well so apparently
Kyle bass was uh posting today that he
talked to somebody who said the the big
terrorist Network in the United
States is
uh in uh Dearborn
Michigan so the United States has now
has a bunch of Hamas and Hezbollah
supporters and quite a few of them and
they're in Dearborn Michigan now the
question is how how many um Islam
supporters would there need to be in
America before America was guaranteed to
turn
Islamic the number is really small it's
like 10% you I think Europe is probably
over that number right so Europe is
above the number where they can survive
I think survive as their current form
they would become Islamic so I think
Great Britain France are probably lost
uh lost or if you like what it's going
to turn into you like I
guess
um so to me it looks like there's I
don't see how that can be reversed
because the thing about uh Islam is is
hard to leave
and many of them well there's a portion
of them that have a pretty aggressive
opinion about things so watch out for
Dearborn Michigan I think maybe the next
100 years will be about trying to escape
Escape War zones because they're going
to be everywhere well the good news is
that ESG is
dying um there were three ESG funds
launched recently while 13 closed down
in the last three months there were 13
ESG funds that closed in the last 3
months and uh as you know black rocks
Larry Fink said quote I'm ashamed of
being part of this conversation talking
about ESG so they were big pushers of
ESG but it became so scandalized that
they didn't want to even be part of
it now it's not bad because there were
three ESG funds launched even though 13
closed but I I think you can see the
trend looks like ESG doesn't have a
chance well Elon Musk of course has been
dragged into the Gaza situation I
wondered why it took so long I like I'm
just waiting it's like okay how does
this
uh will the current fat of being
anti-israel I don't know that that's a
fad I I don't think that's going to
change I believe that the US educational
system is
anti-israel unless you somehow change
the entire education
system what's going to happen so it's
the it's not a trend if it's being
taught to young people if it's being
taught to young people then it's just
education as bad as as bad as that
is all right
um so Israel uh cut ties with uh
starlink because mus said that he would
give starlink access to um only the
authorized International bodies that
were trying to help people in Gaza so he
wasn't going to make it available aable
to all people uh and certainly not all
terrorists but he was going to make it
available to the U the aid
people uh but Israel didn't like that
because quite reasonably they're not
sure if the aid people would be the only
ones who got it so there Israel's
basically just closed down everything um
and uh make it hard in there there's a
uh new technology for
tunnels I knew there would be a new
technology for tunnels did I tell you
that does anybody remember maybe I only
said it on the locals only live stream I
said that you would find out that Israel
had the best you know
tunnel uh killing technology and I guess
they've been training with one of these
technology called sponge
bombs not
SpongeBob SpongeBob is um actually lives
under the sea in a giant p
pineapple almost useless against
tunnels so not SpongeBob but sponge
bomb so apparently it's two different
chemicals you throw this sponge bomb
down the tunnel when it explodes it
expands into this big sponge thing that
hardens and blocks the tunnel now you
say to yourself well why do you need
that you could just you know bulldoze
the tunnel or something well you would
use it if you're in the tunnel trying to
clear it so let's let's say you you're
in a tunnel and there's more than one
way and suddenly you hear the bad guys
coming down one of the tunnel things but
you you still have another tunnel that
you could escape to you can block their
tunnel and still do your work so as you
hear the bad guys coming down this
tunnel you throw the bomb down and block
it and then you keep keep working down
the rest of the
tunnels so it's pretty bad pretty bad
stuff I guess a couple of is Israeli
soldiers were actually blinded just just
doing U exercise with it recently so
it's dangerous stuff but it's one of
their options all right here's the most
interesting
thing um a uh I think it was the last
prime minister of Israel had a very long
uh his name is uh uh naftali
Bennett he uh printed a very long
explanation of what the strategy is or
should be for the
uh um sry Israel's attack on Gaza now
what he's suggesting is a slow squeeze a
Siege so instead of going in
hard um he's saying squeeze it and Siege
it Siege it and squeege it so I'm going
to read uh
the chat gp4 summarization of what the
uh last prime minister said of Israel
so just see if it sounds familiar maybe
you've heard some of this before but
here's the idea uh so this is chat GPT
did a not just a translation but also a
summarization so these are not his exact
words so The Siege plan would be to
suffocate the moss operatives in the
tunnels so if they can turn off the
power the tunnels become almost
impossible to stay in so they can have
an air problem and all kinds of problems
so if they go in
hard well I'll just read
it surprise tactic instead of entering
deep into Gaza the plan suggests
imposing a Complete Siege on Northern
Gaza forcing the boss operatives to
leave their
tunnels right so the first part is you
you don't have to go down the
tunnels the tunnels are already a
prison do you think that even one day in
that tunnel is a good day I don't think
they're having any good days down there
for the rest of time so basically
they're already
captured why would you lose any more
soldiers to capture somebody who's
already captured they're already in the
tunnel they're they're in the worst
place you could be in the world there's
no place I would less rather be than in
a tunnel in
Gaza so you say leave them there you
know they have to come out eventually or
just die there I guess security strip
establishing a 2 km deep permanent
security strip along the
border um so they would clear that out
with
Firepower and I'm not sure the exact
purpose of
it
um if Israel wanted to take the nuclear
option would the US be incentivized to
take them out before they can do it are
you really asking me if the United
States would nuke Israel to stop Israel
from nuking somebody else is that really
what you're asking the answer would be
no we will not nuke Israel to stop them
from doing
anything
um so the security step strip I don't
know that its purpose but I I suggested
at one point that they make a security
strip that would allow anybody who's a
civilian who wants to get out
they'd have a chance right so at least
there'd be some place they could run to
it's like oh if I can get to the
security strip you know maybe I can run
to the other side I don't know if it's
only for that or if it's just for
transportation but they need that
security strip it's probably also so
that they can move their assets where
they want to want to
quickly continuous Firepower so they
would just keep pounding things pounding
and pounding um and then here's the next
part they would isolate
neighborhoods without having to clear
every tunnel so um essentially they'd
find a a neighborhood that's easy to
conquer with relatively low losses and
they would just conquer it and then they
would look for another low hanging fruit
and they would conquer that and they
would basically just
shrink shrink the
battlefield good idea yeah just do it
slowly slow squeeze and he actually uses
the word squeeze I think in in an
article about it so a Siege
squeeze um humanitarian corridors oh
actually that was is exactly what I was
talking
about so give them a corridor so that
they can get you know water and F food
and medicine to the
locals um and then evacuate
them a little at a time so a as you're
able just keep evacuating people if you
don't do the big push you also get to
keep negotiating for uh for the release
of um hostages you got that um he says
uh strategic patience utilizing time as
an
advantage who told you that time was on
Israel's
side now they do have the issue that
they got too many mobilized soldiers
that are out of the economy they got to
get them back
but if you don't do the hard full push
you don't also don't need your full
military they just take their time Siege
it and squeeze
it uh minimizing collateral damage of
course that's going to be good for
public opinion as well as everything
else um they say this would well the ex
prime minister says surprise and
deception So the plan is to catch heras
off guard because they sort of expected
a a full-on uh attack so if you just
don't give them the full-on attack they
may not be as prepared for The
Siege um pressure shift transferring the
pressure from Israel Damas it changes
the power Dynamic it does right if you
do this slow squeeze there's no question
who's who's in control from that point
on
um so this would force the Hamas
leadership to choose between disarming
or facing a historical disaster
basically a slow motion death to all the
Hamas Fighters or disarming and just
surrendering I assume they'll take death
but we'll
see uh and I like this part reduced
likelihood of Hezbollah getting involved
so if Israel did you know a big brutal
bloody you know head-on attack that
would be a trigger that would make it
easy for the other Israel hating
entities to get involved it's like ah
you went too far too far but if you use
the technique that I always tell you my
mother taught me that you can get used
to
anything if you simply keep
squeezing and the news on a Tuesday
sounds exactly like the news on Monday
it's hard for the other anybody to say
ah you went too farz because today is
just like Monday yeah you blew up a few
buildings you squeezed it a little bit
more uh we don't really have a trigger
to go it's sort of like it turned into
just background noise so if they can do
that they can keep other people out of
the fight pretty good
strategy
um align the return of the is Israeli
hostages with the end of FASA power yeah
and the longer they hold the hostages
while The Siege is going
on the less power they
have um compliance with international
law so that they can make sure that
Israel is doing the thing that would
look the most
Humane but also might be the most
effective so that is sort of a twofer
you you would want to be the most
effective but usually that means the
most the most casualties but but this is
a strategy that's the most effective and
the least strategies at least the least
uh
casualties now that
assumes that there's some point where
the civilians can mostly be somehow you
know released from the Battle Zone if
they can never be released it ends the
same everybody's dead but you know much
better chance under international law
especially to get a mount this way so
basically they want to strategically
weaken and isolate Hamas
keep them alive as their symbol of hate
I mean actually keeping Hamas alive for
a little bit that might not be bad you
know make sure that we don't forget them
if Hamas got beaten in a
week a month later we wouldn't remember
them but making us think about him from
3 years to five
years that that's an interesting
strategy so uh this plan hits the right
psychology intern national law uh
military Effectiveness gets some of
their workers back to the regular day
jobs and would be I think completely
effective
so does
that does that uh plan sound
familiar does that sound like any plan
that you'd heard from anybody
before doing the slow squeeze
Siege right Jim Davis he talks about
this all the
time all
right it's old news it's old
news there there's nothing I've ever
talked about in my life where somebody
didn't say two things one it's
impossible it's a bad idea two it's
already being done I always hear both of
those things
already been done and it's
impossible all
right Gold's at
2,000 all
right I just saw the best military idea
I've ever seen require all the people in
Gaza to get vaccinations
all right well that that's just that's
just messed up that's messed
up all right ladies and
gentlemen
um those are my comments for today is
there anything I
missed anybody else want to ask a
question we talked about starlink and
Israel yeah I
mean um I I'm not sure it makes that
much difference whether it's link is
there you know if it's only authorized
for the aid people I don't know how it
could be that bad
but anyway Israel Israel has to be sort
of absolutist at this at the at the
moment oh I'll give you a Maui
update Maui update now the Maui update
unfortunately doesn't have any of the
you know behind the scenes stuff but the
locals let me say this for Maui the
locals are begging for people to come
visit Hawaii for the places that were
unaffected
begging now I don't know how hard it is
to get a place but for the parts of the
island that were not affected by the
fire there are the restaurants are open
the hotels are looking for business I
think um
and but I'll give you one
warning some of the there there are a
lot of locals who are still put up in
hotels so you could end up at a facility
that's got a lot of locals in it as well
as guests if that matters to you you
know might be a might be a little
different you know vibe to it
but um Hawaii is
open you Maui is open for business just
not the Lina part so there's there's
tons of parts that were not directly
affected and let let me put it this way
the locals are mostly back to work the
Ser the the hotel service people but
they're not getting
tips the reason they're not getting tips
is because they're they're handling a
lot of locals because the locals are
there but also there just aren't enough
uh guests so the the
employees you know in the service
industry are just getting
killed because they they're they're
getting base pay if you know what base
pay for a server bartender is you know
how dire that is yeah base pay it's like
below minimum below it's way below it's
way below minimum because they assume
that there are uh
tips so it's a dire situation employment
wise so if anybody was thinking of going
if you had any consideration of going
there you'd be doing a a solid service
to the uh to the people in uh Maui so I
would encourage you to take a look at it
um what is the baly take on Dean
Phillips well I appreciate
your your description of me as the the
baly take but I do accept that I do
accept that um the whole Phillips thing
running for president against Joe
Biden I don't know what he expects to
accomplish um I don't see how he could
ever win the
uh
nomination
but there is there is definitely need
for a
backup the the odds of Biden getting the
nomination and then failing physically
before the election itself is really
high really high so if the if the
Democrats don't have at least one normal
person just sort of sitting there
hanging out who's not KL Harris there
are a lot of trouble
cuz I think their odds are not looking
good right now so it makes perfect sense
as a backup plan he doesn't have any
chance if if Biden's reasonably
healthy um what was the other question
about uh oh Pence dropped out yeah Mike
Pence do you know what I thought about
when I heard that Mike Pence dropped
out I was suddenly reminded oh yeah Mike
Pence is running for
president I don't know who's going to
get his half of 1%
support who knows who
knows but uh that was I think a few more
will drop out pretty soon you know the
the people were sub
2% probably need to do something
else am I related to John Adams the
president uh I'm not a descendant of but
we we probably meet in England at some
point I I assume I assume all the atams
as are related in in England if you go
back far enough but I'm not
sure
um so let's see yeah Mike Pence is
out um who's your
uh who's your uh least trusted candidate
now how do you feel about Nikki
haey does she feel like a military
industrial
complex
choice or is she just good at what she
does I'm not going to repeat that word
you just
used all right rhinos uh yeah she I
think Nikki hilly creates a lot of uh
she has a trump-like
approach in the sense that people when
people are angry they're really angry at
her have you noticed that when I look at
Mike Pence I say well wouldn't be my
choice for president but I don't hate
him you know I don't hate him but I
think people have these really vicious
feelings about Nikki Hy for a variety of
reasons I
guess don't know what that's all
about um what about R swam oh and then
there was a weird
video of Ronda santis and some campaign
event he was walking across the stage
and apparently his boots were so large
that like half half of the boot was
bending as he
walked so people were laughing that his
his boots were twice the size they
needed to be I don't know if that was
just
fun
right Crispy Cream
chrisy all
right uh
uh did Dave get fired no Dave is still
there R
Rami I I like that most of the vake
attacks are fake
news that that should tell you something
about
something like almost all of the the
vake ones are just fake news I don't
think any of it's real actually I think
actually 100% of it is fake news but
people like the fake news yeah when I
when I see the santis my first thought
was the same as uh Pence I just forgot
he was
running when was the last time you saw a
uh D santis like campaign news
event like why is he still running like
it doesn't is he just there in case
Trump goes to jail or something happens
is he the backup
plan
the is Big
Pharma why why would you say V is Big
Pharma because he had a Pharma company
that he doesn't have
anymore but do do you think he's going
to go be a CEO of big
Pharma he's not going to take a
job how how is he connected to Big
Pharma you might want to look into that
a little
bit um what's
that oh people on Twitter are claiming
Netanyahu controls
Hamas well that's just
dumb I saw Ian Bremer Bremer who's well
connected and in the sense that he
understands the entire field and uh he
had a
quote that I'm going to paraphrase it
but it sounded like Netanyahu had said
in
2019 that uh the best way to you know
thwart the Palestinians was to support
Hamas something like that it was like a
cynical plan to support
Hamas because it was really a plan to
make the Palestinian look bad what's the
problem with
that who has a problem with
that and what would it
be is isn't that just like the most
obvious statement in the
world so there was this one time that
Netanyahu said something that was 100%
obvious and everybody thought the same
thing and so he's a bad guy because he
thought exactly what you
think what's what's the ARG arent
exactly is it not completely obviously
true that supporting Hamas for this last
several years was guaranteed
guaranteed to make uh Gaza you know poor
and terrible and not really a threat at
least in a big military sense but in a
terrorist threat
yes yeah now I'm not even sure it was
the wrong play now
obviously you know you could argue well
supporting them ated this this October
7th thing but I feel like it would have
happened
anyway was there something that Israel
could have done differently that would
have made October 7th not happen I don't
think so so if Netanyahu was sort of
cleverly in a three-dimensional chess
kind of way saying the worst thing for
the
Palestinians in terms of their you know
aggression against Israel is to support
the worst leaders because that would
make them ineffective
effective you know what would be the
worst thing that could happen to Israel
in my
opinion Gaza being super um
prosperous the worst thing that could
happen was Gaza being prosperous or the
Palestinians in general being prosperous
because the more money their enemies
have the more of it is going to get
funnel to the percentage of them that
would want to be violent so
unfortunately keeping the Palestinians
in a relatively low economic situation
is probably the only way that Israel can
survive I'm not saying it's you know
moral or good or bad it might be just
the only thing and if there's only one
way to survive it's hard to criticize
it uh the Gaza experiment is over well
Gaza will never be in Independence State
again I feel like I I feel like Goda
will just be
a some kind of special zone of some sort
it you know in the short run it won't be
part of Israel but it will never be some
self-governed Palestinian State uh I
would say that the two-state solution
is absurd at this point would you agree
is there anybody thinks that two-state
solution could ever
work
how would it see here's everything you
need to know about a two stay solution
you ready there's one variable you need
to know about a two-state solution there
are lots of variables involved there's
only one that
matters the Palestinians weaponized
their own
children there's nothing else to say
once they've weaponize their children
you can't help them and you can't let
them
prosper because they're weapons they're
literally weapons so they might be
children they're definitely children but
they're also
weapons and if you treat them like
children you die if you treat them like
weapons that's not good for them but it
is what it
is
so yeah the the the last thing you'd
want is a big old
rich country next to you that also wants
to destroy you more than they want
anything in life that' be your worst
situation I'm actually wondering if um
Gaza will ever be
repopulated because here's what it looks
like it looks like the idea is to um get
rid of every building at least in the
bad parts of Gaza once there are no
buildings there what's anybody going to
go home to then you say we're going to
announce this this big rebuilding
program but Israel will not fund it cuz
you know we're not happy with you but
the rest of the world can rest of world
can fund it and then Gaza will be
rebuilt but since Israel controls the
security and I think always will Israel
can say you absolutely can fund and
rebuild Gaza here are all the obstacles
which you must pass number one the
ownership of the build building has to
be approved by us so we make sure it's
not a Hamas supporter and then they
can't fight anybody they go okay we're
still looking for somebody who Israel
will say is not a Hamas supporter and
then they can own this building and they
can build back but they're but they
can't fight
anybody so I think that Israel will use
a dilber approach to keep Gaza
undeveloped there there will be a plan
to develop them there'll be money to
develop them but nobody will get
building approval because they can't
pass the test of not being
terrorists and why would why would
Israel allow even one building to be
rebuilt in Gaza if somebody that was
their enemy was going to be the
Rebuilder or the owner or even the
tenant right
so I think what they'll do is keep them
in permanent um camps and I think that
they'll make the expense of the camps is
somebody else's problem as in if the
International Community doesn't want to
feed him too
bad why is that our problem so I think
Israel
wants to have a permanent
situation that says that's what Hamas
bought you you know see these camps
where you're living in
misery that was Hamas now of course half
of the world is going to say no that was
Israel but Israel's got a strong
argument there that there would be no
camps if there were no
Hamas
um all
right anything
else Israel's withdrawal in 2005 was an
obvious mistake why why why was Israel's
withdrawal from Gaza
mistake you think this
was not going to
happen and I mean they lost what 15 what
what's the death count
1,500 how many would they have
lost I don't know they might have lost
people a different
way uh I do think that sometimes you
have to make things worse before you can
make them better if what Netanyahu was
doing was allowing Hamas to show the
rest of the
world what Netanyahu and the leaders
already knew that it's not just a
difference of opinion that one group is
just murderers they want to kill you all
the only way that the world could
understand what Hamas was really
understand is to let it
happen now you could say therefore
you're a terrible leader if you created
a situation where you knew this would
happen to which I say compare it to what
compare it to what should they let uh
you know Hamas keep building and getting
stronger until their attack would be
successful I hate to say it but what
happened was the best case
scenario hold that in your head try try
to digest that thought that the Hamas
attack on Israel as horrible as it was
you know one of the most you like
shockingly horrible things in your
entire
lifetime was the best case scenario CU
it was the only thing that authorized
them to take care of of a problem that
had to be taken care of there was no
there was no
longterm there was no way that Gaza
could just build up a unfriendly you
know powers and just keep getting
stronger that wasn't going to happen so
when you look at the I think the problem
that we all have looking at the Middle
East is that we
fantasize that there is a nonviolent
Solution that's Pure Fantasy there there
are no non-violent Solutions you're
choosing among horrible Alternatives
horrible
Alternatives and if you would argue to
me that even as bad as the attack was it
puts Israel in a much stronger position
because now they can finally do what
they have they've needed to do all along
but they didn't have the trigger for it
so so if you tell me that oh that
Netanyahu he created a situation where
it would get
worse maybe he
did and maybe he's the best leader that
they've ever
had can't rule that out now by the way I
don't know if it was a good idea or a
bad idea I'm just putting out the
general idea that you don't know
either you don't know you don't know
that making it worse wasn't the best
thing they could do because there are
other Alternatives was you know maybe
half the country disappearing or
something yeah the the the depth of bad
it could have been is
unfathomable I mean it's fullon
Holocaust what they had was an
absurdly horrendous terrorist attack
that you know affected the entire nation
with
PTSD and might have
been better than the next best
scenario unless you're fantasizing that
everybody just decided to be nice all of
a sudden the alternative isas would have
gotten stronger before they eventually
attacked again
might have had missiles might have had
better drones might have had God knows
what
so um this premise agrees with some
intelligence end lists that I listen to
oh well that's good have you noticed the
ability to Simply uh beat the experts
just because you watch the news a little
bit have you seen how many times that
can be done how many times can the
experts be beaten just by somebody who's
paying attention to the news
no expertise yeah but there there are
some general principles that just apply
to every situation so if you're aware of
general principles about how human
beings typically
work you can bring that to almost any
situation and the the one that I always
bring is you forgot to look at the
alternative how many times do I say that
I say it over and over and over on all
situations and this is another one so so
if your analysis of Netanyahu was he did
a thing that
intentionally created the situation
where Hamas would do this horrible
attack you might be
right you might be right now now argue
that that wasn't the best
case you can't no way to
know but I'll tell you one thing if I'm
in a situation where I have an
unsolvable problem what's the first
thing I do if I have an unsolvable
problem what do I
do shake the
Box shake the box as hard as you can you
have to create a different
situation and the different situation
might be
chaos you might need
chaos to get to the better
situation so we don't know what would
have happened if Netanyahu had had a
different strategy but I'll tell you it
wouldn't have been crazy if his strategy
and I don't know if it was really it
wouldn't have been
crazy to
invite some amount of danger to avoid
some Far Far bigger amount of danger
that's all all right so that's all I'm
going to give you for today YouTube
thanks for joining you are very awesome
today by the way I do appreciate the um
yeah the the super chat questions but
and there were reasonable
questions nor normally the Super Chat
questions or you maybe a little off
topic and stuff but those were perfect
those are good questions I appreciate
them thank you guys and I'll guys and
ladies and binaries non-binaries too bye
for now
