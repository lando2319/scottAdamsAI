buddy
come on in
stream on in
because this
is the best time of the day it's called
coffee with scott adams and if you
haven't enjoyed it before
well are you in for a pleasant surprise
today because all you need to and do to
enjoy it to its maximum potential is
going to get yourself a copper mug or
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
joker flashy vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip have
you heard of it it's famous all over the
world and it's gonna happen right now go
oh yeah that's good
so christine and i went out to eat last
night in our local downtown
and uh
i think it was only maybe a day ago that
people were almost all wearing masks
outdoors still
but as of last night
uh we put on our mask to walk down the
sidewalk and
almost no other masks
so finally californians have decided
that they don't need masks
outdoors
we're a little bit slow
a little bit slow but we're catching on
and i gotta say
it's starting to feel
like we're back to normal
just starting to feel like right on the
edge
of feeling back to normal we're planning
a trip we're
we're acting almost like normal people
we're getting there
apparently there the theory of the virus
having escaped
from a lab
is still in play thanks to a letter that
was published by
in a journal in a journal called science
by a bunch of prominent epidemiologists
and biologists who said
you can't rule out
the possibility that it escaped from a
lab
so
haven't we been told by experts
for the past
year
that we had so at least some of the
experts were saying that they've kind of
ruled out
the gator function and escaped from the
lab thing
no none of that was true
there was no way it ever could have been
ruled out
so
let's follow the science you know follow
the science it's pointing that way
and at the same time it's pointing that
way
so when you you see the sign follow the
science
definitely go right
but also definitely go left
make sure you follow the science
and if you think that's going to be hard
well you're a science denier
because
you just need to follow the science
don't ask questions just follow it
follow it
have i told you before that your
worldview
could be
evaluated in terms of its accuracy
by whether it predicts
now
sometimes you'll have an inaccurate
worldview that will predict once or
twice
just by luck
but if you have a really accurate world
view
it's going to predict
fairly you know accurately and
consistently
so let's see if you could make this
prediction i asked this on twitter
let's say the next time you hear a news
report
that there's been a credible sighting of
a ufo
by an american military entity
what would you predict about the quality
of the video
will it be a
a grainy blob with indistinct features
or will it be
a shiny alien technology
so let's let's use your world view and
make a prediction
granny blob
or shiny alien technology
yeah
the more times you see your prediction
come true
uh
sometime in the next year
there'll be videos of a ufo
in distinct blob
so that should tell you something
here's the provocative question that i
asked yesterday because i'm trying to
ruin everything
and
when you hear this question
i want you to ask yourself why you
didn't think of it
all right here's the question
so we know we have two types of well
three vaccinations in this country we've
got two of them that require two shots
the modern and pfizer but then the j j
requires one
now we know that the one shot
is not as effective as the the two shots
but recently we've learned
that the one shot
isn't even as effective
as the first shot
of the double shot
so here's my question
let's say you wanted to travel
internationally
and you had gotten the j and j
so your your level of uh vaccination is
whatever the j gives you
but you are considered vaccinated
so you could travel
but let's say instead of the j and j
single shot you went for the two shot
dose your first shot
apparently is better than the j and j
but you still have to wait weeks
longer to get the second shot
before you are considered free to you
know be vaccinated and travel
why is it
that the one shot
gives you all the freedom of being
vaccinated
when the one shot from the two-shot dose
is better
better
you're more vaccinated
but you're not considered vaccinated
how many of you
had have had that thought
it didn't occur to me till yesterday for
some reason you get so stuck into your
patterns
that we've just been told that you need
two of this one and one of this one
that when the new the new news came out
that the first shot of the two doses is
actually really really good
uh
i know seems like that should have been
a big news story but
i feel like it wasn't now i'm not saying
you shouldn't get the second
shot i'm sure there's extra benefit and
you know i'm sure they they thought it
through
but my understanding is that the only
reason that we require two of one and
one of the other is that that's the way
they were tested
i don't believe the two shot doses were
tested as one shot
correct me on that but i think that's
the case
so the way the rules are you can only
you can only use them the way they've
been tested
so the two shots were only tested as two
shots i think
fact check me on that
all right
there's a new persuasion play
from the let's say the right
the republican side in which there's a
major push and fox news is doing this a
lot to compare biden to jimmy carter
in fact there's a headline
you know the biden is jimmy carter 2.0
and a number of number of different
personalities on fox
making that comparison
now number one
is the comparison
reasonable
well actually it is you know there's a
number of stories that mirror the 70s
and
there's a little bit of comparison
that's worth making there
but
here's what it occurred to me when i saw
this
when democrats were trying to take down
trump or indeed when democrats were
trying to take out
any republican leader
who did they compare that that uh
republican to
hitler right
so democrats when they want to take you
out
and really prove
that you're the worst person in the
world
they'll compare you to hitler
but when republicans want to take on a
democratic leader
and they want to really make him look
bad they compare him to jimmy carter
they compare him to another democrat
so in order to insult a republican you
have to compare him to some you know
foreign guy who years ago
did horrible things named hitler
but to insult a democrat you just
compare him to another democrat that's
all you need now
somebody needs to tell jimmy carter
that his legacy is not working out the
way he wanted
because hey jimmy uh certain turns out
that you're being used
as the example of the worst thing that
anybody could be as a president
you're not quite hitler
but you're being used in the same sense
we're not saying you're hitler jimmy
carter you're the opposite of hitler
but we're just saying that your name is
used and very much the same utility
so
maybe that's not the best thing
so speaking of persuasion uh israel
did some of the best persuasion in
wartime i've ever seen not only the
persuasion that got the
hamas
fighters into the tunnels so they could
be
bombed by faking out with the news
but
um they managed to make the press more
interested in the press
than they were interested in the
palestinians
now if you've ever seen better
persuasion than that let me know
because the one thing you can guarantee
is that the press
wants to write stories about the press
so when israel bombed that building that
had the ap offices in it you know
everybody had evacuated
so no deaths in that particular attack
but of course you know the story is that
there was some hamas
secret service or something that
was illegal not illegitimately but was
using that building
and
israel cleverly
has made the press use up their shelf
space
talking about the press
now when i say shelf space i use this
concept for the news
because the news has let's say
a front page
which they're going to say okay the news
of the day will about 20 will be this
story 30 will be this story 10 will be
this story so there's a sense of shelf
space
right there's not infinite news
the news fits into the little bucket
because there's the buckets about the
same size every day
so if you can take something about a
story that you don't like being out
there such as
casualties
that that would be a story that israel
would not want a lot of focus on right
doesn't want a lot of pictures of
casualties doesn't want that to be the
main conversation
so they took this shelf space
that would have been the israeli you
know hamas gaza conflict and that that
bucket that was going to be the story
about israel was you know a little bit
flexible it could get bigger but it
couldn't get infinitely bigger it was
going to still only be
a portion of the news
because this is america right we we've
got other stuff to talk about
so
israel managed to take that little
portion that was going to be about the
story
and force a big part of it to be about
the bombing of the ap building
and how do you feel about the bombing of
the ap building
well
assuming that
the story is correct that they gave
warning and there were nobody was hurt
no casualties so you're not you're not
offended by that how about the fact
that
allegedly there was hamas
use of the building
do you believe
that israel believed and was probably
correct
that hamas was using the building
because the ap says they were not aware
of it
well i don't know that the ap would be
aware of it would they
if it's a secret use of a building
i don't think they were advertising hey
by the way
you know uh
see you at the water cooler and uh by
the way we're a major terrorist
organization what do you do for a living
well i'm in the ap i mean i don't think
the ap would have necessarily known what
everybody was doing in the building
so you're probably looking at the story
and saying okay if if hamas was in there
it was a legitimate target nobody got
hurt
but here's the other part
how much do people like the press
imagine these two questions just asked
of people in the united states as an
example
how much do you
like or care about or have empathy for
the palestinian people
well you'd find a lot of people in the
united states who say i have lots of
empathy
tons you know maybe you do or do not
approve of what their leaders are doing
but the actual just you know mom and dad
and kids just trying to survive everyday
life
of course you've got all kinds of
empathy for them even if you think
israel is doing the right stuff
but how much empathy do you have for the
press
not as much right
so israel has managed to convert some of
your attention
which somewhat naturally would have been
in empathy at least some of it is being
transferred over to
well the press
do you care
now because nobody got hurt
it just doesn't feel the same right just
feels like computers getting blown up
and they were probably backed up anyway
so
how many people in the comments
let's see let's see in the comments tell
me how many
uh palestinians have been killed so far
in the recent fighting
in gaza
in the comments i want to see how well
informed you are
have the distractions
uh gotten to you yet so give me your
estimate in the comments and i'll see
i'll read them out and i'll tell you how
close you are
before i tell you how many people died
uh i'm seeing uh
150 30 more than 109
let's see some more
i see 0 50 25 25 150 75 160. the people
who are in that 150 160 range are about
right
um so you are the more informed ones
but those who have smaller numbers
maybe distraction uh helps that
yeah
all right um
so i would say this is like the the
greatest persuasion military persuasion
i've ever seen
because uh
it just makes the press care about the
press
gary pruitt the ceo of the ap
said this he said talking about it and a
closing statement about it he said the
world will know less about what is
happening in gaza because of what
transpired today meaning the blowing up
the ap ap building
now is that good for israel
or bad for israel
it's kind of good isn't it
isn't the last thing that israel wants
is more reporting within gaza because
that's where
the casualties are going to be
so it's the last thing they want
so i would say israel
totally got away with blowing up that
building
totally got away with reducing the
amount of reporting that will come out
of there
totally got away with transferring our
attention to a story that's not about
the casualty so much
uh
this is a home run persuasion wise now
this has nothing to do with whether you
support israel's actions or support the
palestinians actions we're only talking
about technique
in terms of technique
of persuasion
i this is as good as you get i mean this
is like the play of the decade or
something
and
just to you know make the point
uh i just saw a joel pollock uh report
in breitbart that the abraham accords
are holding
so the other arab countries
apparently are just tired of the
palestinians
so the other arab countries and largely
they would be aligned against iran who
is supporting
hamas so it kind of makes sense
but apparently the other countries have
just said ah
work it out
just
it's not about us anymore work it out
so
i honestly i don't know that israel
could have created a better situation
out of a terrible situation the terrible
situation
being the
the bloodshed now the other thing that
israel is doing right
how many videos have you seen of the
actual on rockets being launched out of
gaza
you've seen that right
probably a lot of them how many videos
have you seen of the iron dome uh trying
to stop those rockets
probably a bunch right
so have i told you
far too often
the visual persuasion is the only one
that matters really
unless unless you have an immediate fear
fear is always the biggest motivator but
if if you're not operating personally
from fear
then visual persuasion is what's getting
you the most right all the concepts the
history
whatever you think about the blah blah
blah
it's nothing compared to the picture
and israel controls the the picture
somehow i mean you see lots of missiles
and you say to yourself my god
israel has a right to respond look at
all those missiles
how many of you know how many missiles
were fired into israel roughly
in the comments
let's see if this information got
through
but the number of casualties
maybe not so much we'll test this
hypothesis
number of
what is the number of uh
somebody says there's an irritating
sound coming from my nose
i don't think it's coming from my nose
so i don't know what you're hearing
but
um all right so number of rockets fired
well looks like you know the number of
rockets fired
so 1500 2 000 that's in the range right
it's over a thousand
so by now it's in that range so look at
how how well you do how many rockets
were fired at israel
right
but look how only maybe half of you
had an idea what the casualties were
think about it you knew the number of
rockets
but you didn't know the number of
casualties as much some of you knew both
all right
so that's what visual persuasion is
getting yeah
uh lindsey graham apparently was on not
apparently he was on judge jeanine show
and called for the death penalty
for cyber terrorism
thank you
lindsey graham
i feel like
you know there are times when i don't
agree with lindsey graham probably quite
a few times
you know if you looked at all the things
we could talk about
but i gotta say
that lindsey graham
is one of the ones who's
you know
smarter
he's just smarter than other people
you know even if you don't like where
he's heading he's smarter
and he's calling for the death penalty
for cyber terrorism i agree with that
and i think we should have had that in
place when we were negotiating with this
this hacker group for the
colonial pipeline which i understand is
back in action so that got
sorted out
but any hacker who is doing something
to the united states as big as a
pipeline hack
they should be
looked at for the death penalty
so joe biden was
he issued a statement for police week
if you're the president of the united
states and you release a statement for
police week
wouldn't you kind of expect it to be
sort of a
positive statement
we're celebrating the police
who risked their lives every day
to keep our country safe
feels like police week would be a good
time to say something nice about the
police
but if you're a democrat leader
apparently you can't do that anymore
so instead he said there was a deep
sense of distrust
black americans feel toward the cops in
the wake of high-profile
custody deaths i mean used his own words
but that's what he said
and i will say the following
have we yet heard any cases of
let's say
a black man in america
being killed by police unless
either there was a resisting arrest
or
the person tragically had something in
their hand like a cell phone that was
mistaken as a weapon
because mistaking something for a weapon
it just feels like its own category i
don't feel like you should put that into
any other category
mistaking a weapon is just a mistake
it's a bad one it's the worst one you
can make
but it's a mistake
there's nobody who made a decision oh
there's a person with a gun in their
hand but they're black so i guess i'll
shoot
versus oh they're white i guess i won't
shoot nobody's doing that it's just a
mistake
so until i started hearing stories
any of them really
where there was either resist no
resisting arrest
or there wasn't something in their hand
that could have been gun-like
which i have to say is a little bit like
resisting arrest
let me tell you what i'm not going to do
if the police are
are aiming at me
i'm not going to hold something in my
hand
if the police come toward me and i see a
gun out
hands go open and they go up
boop drop whatever you got
do this
if you're behind the car
and you're going to emerge from behind
the car with something in your hand
put it down
go like this
walk around the car
anybody who's not doing that and getting
shot
there's a limit to my empathy for
anybody who's exactly like that
um
we've got a here's a little persuasion
plan for persuasion uh lesson for you
so stefan i think it's stefan uh richer
who's the maricopa county recorder
and apparently he's got some
um you know official job in america
maricopa county where this
uh where the recount is happening
so there's an election recount happening
and one of the claims that president
ex-president trump made and lots of
other people have made in the press etc
the claim
allegedly
is that there's uh some part of the
database is missing
and has been deleted
something that they needed to look at
now
steph stefan or stephen
richard says the following
in a tweet he said here's a great
example of a plain as day lie
that will lead our arizona residents to
think the maricopa county database has
been entirely
deleted
help me call out this lie
and before this he said he was literally
sitting in front of his computer
looking at the database
so his claim
is that no databases have been deleted
he's sitting there looking at it himself
and he's calling out the president for
being completely wrong
and he says that the database has not
been
entirely deleted
it's not been entirely deleted
so
i tweeted back uh this persuasion tip
next time say
quote no part of the data has been
deleted
because when you say the database
database hasn't been entirely deleted
it reads exactly like a confession
if somebody in your personal life use
this wording wouldn't it sound like a
confession
it doesn't sound like a defense
it sounds exactly
exactly
like a confession
scott did you did you throw out the
yogurt that was in the refrigerator
i did not throw out everything in the
refrigerator
see what i'm saying
scott uh
did you take uh do you take that charger
and at the bedroom
i did not remove all the bedroom
furniture
scott did you get a haircut i did not
shave my body
what
uh
scott did
you eat a bagel this morning
i did not eat all the food in the world
there are still people in china with
plenty of food i can prove it
worst
tweet of all time
and now um
and now for my favorite uh lesson in
persuasion
there is a
presumably a
chinese government troll i'm going to
make that allegation without having
proof of it but i'd say the evidence
the evidence is strong
and
his name and he's worth following
because he's he's so funny
uh his name is chen
maybe
w-e-i-h-u-a ue
is that the right pronunciation
but anyway chen um
often comes in and tweets about things
i've said or other people have said
and
he seems obviously like a chinese
government troll i don't think there's
any doubt about it really i mean i might
be wrong maybe
so i'll just say it's an allegation but
one which i treat to treat as true
whether it is or not
and
uh he was tweeting about
israel blowing up the ap building
and he said this
if china or russia had done anything
remotely like this saki blinkin biden
sullivan rubio cotton hawley would all
go berserk
now they are all pretending brain dead
this is why i like his tweets
now they are all pretending brain dead
so i tweeted back at chen and i said is
your government still shipping fentanyl
to the mexican cartels
to poison america
ask your free media to look into it
now
i don't know why chen thinks it's a good
idea to tweet back at me because he
really should just let it go
he's not really winning when he tweets
back at me
um
and then he said back to me chen said
you seem to be a fervent believer of
trump slash pompeo lies
all right all right
got his attention
and so i tweeted back a persuasion tip
to chen
i said next time
say quote
china is doing no such thing as your
denial
when you attack the credibility of the
sources instead it comes off as a
confession over here in america
i hope you didn't get executed by your
government for that huge mistake
i'd miss you
so
i don't know if i just killed a chinese
spy
but maybe
maybe
it could be a tough day for him
how would you like to be the chinese spy
or the
alleged or the chinese troll and have to
explain to your boss
that you just um you just confessed
to the biggest crime of the decade
or the century i don't know
so
these are the type of lessons uh
which you would be learning on the
locals platform
if you were a subscriber
um
somebody says the ccp can't debate yeah
it's really tough for them to debate
because anywhere that they go
we're gonna you know if you're debating
anybody who's who's associated with the
chinese government
it's gonna take me about one degree of
separation
before i'm bringing up fentanyl
or genocide
it's all going to go that way
what's the topic oh let's talk about the
weather all bet is raining on the
uyghurs who are
subjected to genocide so it's going to
be nothing but genocide and fentanyl
anytime i have any conversation with
china and i don't care about anything
else
all right
don thank you for subscribing to locals
i appreciate that
all right is there anything else going
on it seems like we're we're in this
weird uh dearth
of news
because uh trump is not uh mixing things
up oh apparently apparently uh trump now
has his own website it's called can
somebody help me
from the desk of is that the name of his
website
so i think trump and there was some
technical problem with it i it probably
crashed from traffic or something
uh scott can you tell us about the
tennis ball incident again
what instant was that i don't remember
remind me
um
oh is there an expiration date on the
locals offer i don't have a planned
expiration date on that
but
you know at some point i'll i'll remove
it
um
let me just see what comments you have
here
um
oh homeless yeah homelessness in
california is a mess let me talk about
that in a minute
um mark asked me scott hypothetically if
you had the opportunity to do so would
you have any interest in
uh in interviewing an individual
who is a ccp official
ah i mean i don't know what would be the
point of that because it would just be a
bunch of lies and there would be obvious
lies and
i don't know is there is really a point
to that i don't know if there is
um so speaking of the homeless yeah so
california is doing uh
i think it's called a housing first idea
if you get them housed first and then
provide a number of support services for
mental health and addiction mostly
that that's the best way to go i think
there are others who
think that treating the addiction and
the mental illness first is the big
problem because housing is
you know isn't going to work unless you
you do those things
so
all i can say is that california somehow
has a budget surplus
and we're spending a lot of money on the
homeless
no logan i have not seen
john cullen's video
so i don't think i don't think we're
overspending
if we have a budget surplus maybe we're
over taxing that would be the other way
to look at it
but
i don't know that anybody has the right
answer with homeless stuff because the
problem is
that
trying to turn people who
can't figure out how to
get that part of their life together
i just don't know how much they can be
moved and probably just
10 percent of them can be moved back
into the productive cycle i would
imagine
i can't imagine it'd be much more than
that
uh is california's pension fund part of
the budget i don't know but it's
interesting question
right um
how many of you would lie and say you
were fully vaccinated if you were only
partially vaccinated
in the comments
if you were on the the two shot regimen
and you had had one shot and waited a
week
you're pretty well vaccinated after one
shot
would you ever lie
let's say you didn't need to show a
passport but you had to
would you lie and say you're vaccinated
um i would get caught i would me sure so
almost all of you would lie
i see a few no's
but almost all of you would
let me give a little tip to our
government
all right here's a little uh advice
for the american government
similar to advice i would give anyway
if your citizens won't obey you and it's
obvious that they won't i mean this is
this is complete
i mean i see a few no's but i see almost
complete disobedience
almost complete
it's like 90 disobedient
based on the comments if you're if your
citizens
90 percent of them are gonna disobey
your recommendation you've lost
credibility
you've lost it
and that's a pretty big thing to lose
certainly on a
health question
and i do think that
you know i've said this before you want
your government to be in charge when
there's emergency
even if they make mistakes it's still
better than everybody just running
around randomly right so you definitely
want the government calling the shots
in the middle of the emergency but as
you get toward the end
the government is the wrong decision
maker
because once you get to the end you've
got these more nuanced decisions about
you know the quality of life
everybody's individual risk etc and the
general rules are not going to work as
so well for individuals
at that point
the citizens just have to take control
i would argue that that's already
happened and that the government and the
cdc probably
i feel
followed public opinion
give me give me a read on that
in my opinion
the public decided that masks outdoors
had to go
and then the cdc
agreed
did you see it that way
to me it looks like the public's already
in control there's just a little time
lag between the time that the public
demands it and the time that the cd says
cdc says well okay
you know so when you're looking at the
stores that may or may not require you
to wear a mask and all that that's all
going to take care of itself
because the public
i believe
in my opinion right now
the public is managing
the crisis
or the end of the crisis right
i don't think it's the government in
charge anymore i think they lost
their moral authority
through a number of sketchy decisions
that were transparently false
you know when they lied about the masks
we were already
you know as soon as the lying about the
mask thing happened
i think everybody was a little bit
i'm gonna i'm gonna look at you really
carefully from now on
all right
somebody says the cdc was never
following the science well i disagree
with that statement
i would only add this qualifier which is
people don't know what the science is
even the cdc probably the experts were
debating what is true and what isn't and
how much risk you put into any of this
so i wouldn't say they weren't following
the science
i would say they tried
it's just not easy
i'd like to hear scott talk about when
we reach herd immunity well i don't have
an opinion that's much different than
the experts 70 percent
you know if the experts are saying 70
i'm not going to
debate the math i don't have a better
idea
but i do think that this is a unique
um a unique kind of virus
because
um of how it doesn't attack the young
people so much
so it could be that you just count young
people as effectively
you know vaccinated like if you if you
took the young people who are healthy
who just aren't going to have a problem
and just say ah let's count them as
as good as vaccinated
now they're not as good as vaccinated
because they might be able to transmit
it better than vaccinated people i don't
know
but uh
but it feels like that
yeah so there's a cernovich quote
somebody's giving me that that all all
experts are right one day and wrong a
week later at some point we just have to
live our lives
yeah so you really need to learn
how to make decisions in a world in
which the experts can't be trusted
that's the world we're in maybe i've
always been there
um has anybody reached out to me about
the debt crisis once i started talking
about it
a number of people have commented
um yes
but
it looks like inflation is going to be
what we're going to do to get rid of it
which is not ideal
all right
i'm going to end a little bit early
today i've got to do something and then
i will talk to you
tomorrow oh what's your longest e-bike
trip um 20 miles
all right that's it for now bye
