i can get this to work
well here's an experiment in audio
design you want to see the setup here we
go
we've got two road casters
one here one over there connect it to
one each to an ipad and
right now to a laptop so
in theory you're getting excellent sound
both in youtube and in locals
so sounds great over at locals i'm
hearing
and is the the volume nice and loud
i've got the de-esser going on here
yeah i think i had a wrong setting or
wrong cable or something this morning
but i decided to solve this with brute
force
so my my long-term goal had been this
to have two simultaneous platforms so
i've got
youtube here and the locals platform
over here
and i wanted to have only one microphone
had to be a clip on because i moved too
much so i like to move around
but i wanted one microphone going into
whatever devices
a de-esser and i wanted it to stream to
two devices so
the the other thing that i wanted to
accomplish
is that if you use one of the
consolidation softwares like
obs you get a delay
in the comments so the comments are not
real time
so if i've got real devices i'm going to
have two ipads but right now i have an
ipad and a laptop
i've got a road caster pro
going to each stream but i've got one
microphone
with an xlr t connection
so that i could have one microphone go
to two road casters
and then by usb c
connection the only one i found that
works
goes to the laptop and the ipad
yeah i played back the morning podcast
and it was way lower than normal not
sure exactly why
i cut your hair hippie oh the de-esser
is working good
so now i have a de-esser on both sides
and
what's the mic level showing um i'm
about
three quarters up on the mic level so
it's not quite hitting the the orange
yet
um sound seems fine
f those youtubers you say well
have i done it after five years of
experimenting
have i finally accomplished the ultimate
which is finding a
a capable system now there's nobody
who's getting low sound now right
everybody's getting a nice crisp sound
the bsr has a de-esser
yeah i do uh
it's louder persistent sounds good
yay i think we got it now i've told you
before that i'm a
autodidac which means that it takes me
ten times longer to do anything and the
reason is that i
i try to work things out myself and i'm
not
qualified story of my life and so what i
did was
i tried to teach myself enough about
audio engineering that i could put
together
a system that would just work every time
for me
and i can't tell you how many times i
tried and failed
you should see the pile of cables and
hardware and connections
and gadgets in my my back store room
it's just chairs are full of
because i've got bad storage but
i've tried if i had to guess how many
times i've tried to get this
right before getting it right now
i'd say
maybe 150 tries something like that
there's still people saying the volume's
too low
apparently nobody can be happy well my
my ultimate dream is that i'll know who
the trolls are
because the sound will be fine
yeah sounds perfect we pay people a
hundred thousand
dollars to do what you've done part of
what i wanted to do here
is see if i could through brute force
which means
basically paying a little extra money
and trying everything
i wanted to see if i could come up with
a system that would work
for everyone and
the volume is too medium
so here's maximum volume right there all
right
youtube you've got maximum volume i'll
put up the microphone too
all right the microphone and the
output are both at maximum value volume
is that better
um just right so you like it at maximum
value
volume do you have audio compression
i don't think it's compressing now
oh it's better okay uh
level was good before going to max so
some of you are having a different
experience
uh locals is all good yeah i tested
locals myself and that looks good
how loud are you talking um i'm
talking like i would talk to somebody
who is let's say
on the other side of a living room so
i'm giving it a little oomph
but i'm not talking like i would talk
you know up close uh
compression sounds like you would do the
fuzz some good
i don't know would it
so uh if i if i get this
to work more than once
take the kill shot if i get this to work
more than once i'll document it
so people can figure it out at the
moment
this would cost you about three thousand
dollars per
stream so between the uh
the road caster pro the dedicated ipad
and the microphones about three thousand
dollars per stream
so that's expensive i have another
another way to do it but it doesn't have
a built-in de-esser
um what time is it yes it's not the
morning
do you ever have that that thing where
you take an afternoon nap
and you wake up and you think it's the
morning but it's really
it's 5 p.m instead of 5 a.m
per stream yes 3 000 per stream
so the the setup i have here not
counting the cost of the
laptop is about six thousand dollars
so that's the high-end ipad plus a road
caster plus a
high-end microphone
um
volume on youtube is slightly lower
okay so i've got youtube um
all the way up yeah one time purchase
that's correct
um audio is only
great yeah so current current situation
is about three thousand dollars per
stream
now i have a i have a less expensive
option but it doesn't have a de-esser
built in and i would have to do a little
engineering to make that work
uh kevin says it's slightly hissy
does anybody else have that the um
microphone max is best
so i've got the macro i got both the
microphone and the output
at max i think i'll uh
oh i hear somebody say no hiss okay so
some of that
somebody says feedback i doubt there's
feedback i've got one microphone
nobody else is hearing feedback right
sounds a little tinny
i think the hiss is due to compression
but i don't think i have any compression
turned on
no feedback and not tinny so it looks
like uh
can you adjust screams to look at both
youtube and locals at the same time oh
yeah i can
when i'm not doing a test let's let's
see what that looks like
so the question was could i put my
screens close enough together
that i'm looking at both of you at the
same time and the answer is yes
and i am so embarrassed that somebody
had to tell me how to do this
so the the first bunch of times i did
this i had two ipads sitting next to
each other
and it was difficult because the the
camera is on the same side
so one would be here and then the other
one would be on the other side of the
other
the other ipad and it i think i used it
like that for
i don't know two years and somebody said
take the second ipad and turn it upside
down
and put the two cameras together now of
course the ipad doesn't care which side
it is because it just adjusts to upside
down
so all i had to do was put the cameras
together turn it upside down
listen to both simultaneously
good thank you thank you for doing all
this testing by the way
um yeah so youtube is on an ipad
and i've got the laptop right now
working on
locals uh the next thing i'm going to do
is i have
ipads on order so i have two ipads
and then i can get the lighting the same
the same on both
um
corey you're happy with my test thank
you
raise your voice in anger
uh you would do this stream while
holding a cat if i could get my cat
to stay still i would totally do my live
stream
with a cat now let me let me tell you
what i've
learned so far about sound equipment
number one wouldn't you love to see a
big professional looking microphone
they might give you a little extra
advantage but i find it's one more thing
to think about
because if there's a microphone that i
have to adjust to
then when i'm doing all of my moving
back and forth and grabbing my coffee
cup and stuff
my audio is going to be suspect or i'm
going to be thinking too much
about being close to the microphone how
many times have you seen
joe rogan where he has to tell the guest
to be closer to the microphone
so you do what you want to avoid in
every case
is any extra complication
any at all the the slightest extra
complication
you just have to get rid of it because
there are massive failure points
so everything about this is just to
drive it to the lowest
potential failure point
now what i found was that the a high
quality
lavalier clip on mic which might only
cost
you know 20 bucks or something gives you
as good a sound
for this purpose as a you know an
expensive
desktop or microphone that comes from
above
the de-esser settings are too high
well the de-esser only has one setting
on these devices
so the de-esser is either on or off
and i i do know enough to know this some
de-essers
you know you customize to your voice
i don't believe the road caster pro has
that option i think it's just
on or off so it's probably picking some
middle ground de-esser situation
ask dave rubin how he does a sound i
know the answer to that
so i've been in dave rubin's home
studio a few times and the way he does
the sound is he hires an engineer
i could do that i know how to hire an
engineer
but the whole thing is that i do my live
stream
in my pajamas in my house
all alone drinking coffee
that's sort of the whole deal as soon as
i add a staff
it's just not the same show
you should not be too entertained by
this this is a
audio check but i since you're here i
thought i'd
gabby you a little bit
host lost connection somebody's saying
but that
must not be affecting everybody else
uh mic check
all right everything's working great all
right well i will see you
in the morning at my official coffee
with scott adams
and uh i can't wait
to finally get the sound right the
lighting is brilliant
i can do the lighting better but at the
moment
so let me show you over on youtube it'll
be easier to show you i think
i guess that doesn't work
there it is
so
uh don't look at my ratty massage here
so i've got these uh
blackout curtains which the youtube
folks are looking at right now
uh but one of them is these are
the battery charged so it's not closed
uh and i gotta say the if you're trying
to do the
any kind of uh podcasting and you're
trying to get the light right
here's the biggest tip if your room
cannot be made totally dark with
blackout curtains
you can never get the right light right
so let me say that again if anybody's
trying to do this i spent
months and months and months to learn
this difficult lesson
if there's any light coming from
anywhere outside the room
you just can't light it it just can't be
done because that light will always
change
it's never the same the light coming
from outside
all right and that
why am i making you look at curtains
doesn't make sense
so here's my device
and then i can program these babies
these buttons over here
um on the sorry locals i was just
showing the youtube people something so
on the road caster i've got buttons i
can
program with sound effects and certain
things
so i'll be playing with that a little
bit is this the best room for you to
broadcast
i haven't tried them all
um am i gonna program
ad-libs
all right uh yeah this is
this is massive a b testing you're
seeing it live
you know i've told you before that um
having no shame whatsoever
an inability to be embarrassed
um if there's inability to be
embarrassed is like a superpower
so i've been testing my audio live
and failing massively i've been failing
in the live stream failing the tests i
said earlier i probably tested
150 different hardware
configurations to get a sound right
um all right
a little shine off the top of my head
yeah the other thing i do is if i get
the lighting
indirect enough i don't need to have
makeup you can see
unfortunately with the better lighting
you can see that i would need it if i
if i were going to light it well
would i like some tips sure
shows the deck again and we can
troubleshoot it
well there's there's nothing to see here
it's i mean i
i don't have any problem with the
hardware or the
technology it's pretty straightforward
the the hardest part was figuring out
which outputs to use which is why i
ended up with two of them
because i can't get one of them to do
two outputs no matter what i do
and i tried dozens and dozens of ways to
do it and none of them worked
but this works um
intro music in the future maybe i'm
still trying to uh
learn the drums am i still in my pj's
dumb and my
i'm in my gym shorts right now uh
any comments on that anomaly guy well
not today i think we said what we needed
to say
but i've noticed that my critics
don't disagree with me my critics
especially in all the covent stuff those
critics
almost universally the people who don't
like my takes
didn't didn't understand them so
if you subtracted my critics who simply
didn't understand my point
i wouldn't have any left basically
uh road is great customer service well
i'm not so sure i'd say that
i did ask for help and didn't get any so
i had to figure it out myself
any comment on the arizona results
well the fact checkers uh as of today
said that there's no irregularity there
at the same time the the the headlines
in fox news were there lots of
regularities
but the fact checkers said nope no
regularies
no irregularities
so i'm willing to
accept any possibility there could be
they find something could be they don't
and frankly neither situation would
surprise me i think they're both in play
at this point
all right i'm going to shut down now and
do some other stuff and i will see you
in the morning we'll talk about all
those irregularities and more
thanks for watching in my soundcheck
youtubers i hope this is better for
tomorrow
