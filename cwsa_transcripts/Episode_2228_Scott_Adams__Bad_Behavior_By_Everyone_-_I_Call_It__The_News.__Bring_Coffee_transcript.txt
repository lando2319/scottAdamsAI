[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
possibly Mars the civilization not to uh
just to the Future
oh YouTube doesn't have sound
probably YouTube would be better if I
put my microphone on
[Music]
probably this would be better if I had
my microphone on too
I bet everything would be better with
sound
that's what I think
if you'd like to take your uh oh oh
apparently I have to turn off the uh the
comments for every every episode I
thought I'd have them off but the the
YouTube comments I will be ignoring
because there's too many anti-semites if
you'd like to make comments you could
always be on the subscription locals
platform
or you could be on the X platform that's
streaming live right now at the same
time but too many anti-semites
on YouTube and I think they're not
organic I think somebody's sending them
here so we're gonna ignore them but if
you'd like to take your experience up to
levels which I've never seen before all
you need is a copper mugger glass a
tanker Chelsea Style again teen Jokers
fill with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better is
called the simultaneous sip go
ah
so good
so good
well I hear the people who are ordering
my hard copper hardcover version of
reframing your brain
the notices that's taken to October 19th
which means
you probably don't want to wait Beyond
November to order it if you're going to
get it for gifts
now a lot of people are buying you know
five to ten copies of the book because
it turns out it's sort of the perfect
gift for literally everyone
anybody who can read because it will
change lives it's guaranteed
and some people told me that the best
thing about giving this book as a gift
is this the first time they can explain
who I am
because a lot of people are getting heat
for listening to me
if you've been getting Heat
for listening to me
this book will explain me in a way that
other people will understand for the
first time
so that's one benefit from it if you're
having a hard time explaining why you
would listen to Somebody Like Me that'll
do it for you it's already changing
lives in a very big way
so don't wait too long or you won't have
yours by Christmas all right because as
you know reality likes to follow the
path
of most entertainment
the winner of the U.S Open tennis was a
Djokovic
and Djokovic is famous for what besides
tennis
famous for rejecting vaccinations
to the point where was it last year he
was not even allowed to play in the U.S
open
because he was unvaccinated
well he came back he won the damn
tournament and uh he was not only the
winner but the sponsor
sponsor of the tournament let's see one
of them was a moderna
moderna and so he was featured in the
moderna shot of the day
that's right they showed a highlight of
Djokovic the most famous denier of
vaccinations
and it was labeled the shot of the day
moderna
yeah
yep yep
that's almost as bad as uh Tick Tock
advertising on Fox News
as soon as you hear the advertiser you
go oh man what's going on here
so that's happened
there's a company called Voyager labs
who theoretically hypothetically
can predict a crime before it happens
now New York City is using the software
but not in that way so that's not the
only thing it does
so they say New York City is not using
it to predict crime
but it could do it
there's there's a thought that it could
do it but here's my question
as much as I'm not sure I want the
government to be able to predict crime
because you know that that's going to go
terribly wrong right if the government
can predict crime this is not a good not
a good predictive sort of thing
but here's a question I ask you
what if citizens could use it to protect
themselves
would that be wrong
suppose you could you could run it
against everybody that I know AI knows
is living in your neighborhood and even
if you could check the police
that are your local police that are on
your streets
suppose you got you got uh stopped in a
by a police for speeding or something
suppose you could tell immediately if
your police officer was going to be
dangerous to people like you
yeah wouldn't that be useful if as soon
as you saw the police officer come up
and you saw the name if somehow you had
some way to know oh this one's a bad one
you know this one's been accused of you
know five different abuses already so
you better better you keep it under
wraps or suppose it would tell you to
move
suppose you ran this offer and said um
you're a single woman living in this
neighborhood your odds of being abused
are 80 80 you better get the hell out of
here
I don't know I feel I feel like
something that was predictive of crime
would be useful to Citizens because you
could even know if your own friends are
likely to steal from you
wouldn't that be handy to know if the
people you're working with or the people
you want to do and deal with are likely
to rob you
that's an interesting question I don't
know if the software could actually
identify that kind of risk but if it
could
if it could would you use it
it's kind of creepy
it would definitely discriminate but it
would also keep you safe
well Joe Biden can anybody confirm that
this really happened I saw it on a tweet
but I did not see a source is it true
that Joe Biden said I guess yesterday
maybe that China has become too weak to
invade Taiwan
because their economy is so bad
he actually said that what do you think
of that
do you think that's true
you know you know what's interesting is
it might be a little bit true
it's certainly not true enough
right it's not 100 true and it's
probably not 50 true
but it's an interesting point that that
their their economy
is a little bit sketchy but I would be
surprised if they couldn't mount a war
with their existing assets
so
I think that's an overstatement but it's
a variable
it might be a variable that's making a
try to have second thoughts imagine if
you are
um
president XI
and sure you're a dictator so you got a
lot of control but you still need to
keep other people happy
right because the the other Elites could
gang up on you if you were just totally
out of control
so even the head of China needs to make
other people happy
imagine if imagine if you're the head of
China president XI and you see that
you've got all these other economic woes
and the really big ones like demographic
problems things you can't really easily
fix
so let's say you see manufacturing is
leaving you know you're you're maybe
losing some of your access to some
high-tech stuff
yeah you're a little bit uh pressured by
everybody you got to spend a lot on
Social Services you've got 50
unemployment among the youth suppose
you've got all those problems and at the
moment they're sort of a little bit
under wraps
meaning that the average Chinese citizen
is probably not not thinking about them
every moment of the day
so you're you're kind of stable but
there's a lot of stuff a lot of big
stuff that could be a problem and fairly
soon
under those conditions
would you want to take the chance of
your economy imploding
coincidentally at the same time that you
started a war
because the problem is if it looked like
you made a mistake starting a war
at the same time it looked like you made
a mistake managing the economy
that might be too many mistakes
so if you're a Chinese leader could you
stand the the internal National pressure
of having a failed economy and a war
that's not maybe going too smoothly
because who knows what would happen
I feel like I feel like Biden is on to
something
I feel like if China's economy were 100
solid
the president she could take a chance of
screwing up a war
and still stay in power
but if the economy is bad and there's a
war the Chinese public are going to say
why are we spending money on a war
when we've got these other problems you
know just like the American economy is
so it could be that the best thing to
reduce the chance of war in the world is
bad economies
because Wars make economies worse
especially if you lose all right
so maybe maybe binds onto something a
little bit there
so Biden was in Vietnam embarrassing the
country
but he picked the right country to do it
you know if you're going to send Biden
onto the international stage
wouldn't you want to send them to a
country that values the elderly
yeah I don't think we should send Biden
anywhere
where they don't have a real strong
cultural preference
for showing respect to the elderly
because can you imagine the face of the
Vietnamese uh you know leaders who were
greeting them uh
yeah you're totally all right
uh-huh the things coming out of your
mouth totally makes sense oh we respect
you you Elder
yeah I got a feeling that they could
fake it better than other countries
can you imagine the Russians
imagine Biden imagine Biden taking this
performance to Russia you know as if he
would travel to Russia but imagine the
Russians watching Biden you know
flustered and mumbling around and
wandering off
they would literally be drinking and
laughing
but you take him to Vietnam and
everybody's like
we respect the elderly let's let's just
let him let him be
[Laughter]
so I don't know
the the fact that there's sort of a cats
on the roof quality to the old Biden
experience you know what I mean he Biden
is failing right in front of us
but because every day is sort of similar
to the day before but you know half a
percent worse
every day you say ah today well
it's not that much but worse than it was
yesterday
and then the next day uh
it's just not that much worse than
yesterday but if you start adding it up
you know at least half of one percent of
worse every day
things are looking pretty bad in six
months if you know what I mean
compounding compounding interest
so that's how we got here to this absurd
ridiculous situation
uh I guess commonly Harris was sent to
the 911.
event today
and Biden said he was going back to bed
after he talked to the people in Vietnam
now I to be fair the time change must be
brutal you know beyond a certain age
traveling and time changes and tough
schedules it's got to be brutal I have
to admit
um but maybe you shouldn't say it out
loud
I'm going back to bed
all right
uh
California is
kind of quietly looking to reverse a
California law that would punish doctors
for spreading coveted misinformation
now in all of the uh can we call it
 of the pandemic
somehow I'd forgotten
that California had a law
that doctors who are doing their doing
their best to help their customers but
if if they happen to say something that
was not the approved Orthodoxy of what
you can say
they could be punished
for being
wrong according to other people not for
being wrong
we're not talking about punishing the
doctors for being wrong
no that's not even the topic it's not
about being wrong it's that they can't
even say it
if it's against the you know the
standard interpretation
so the fact that it's not about being
right or wrong should be the scariest
thing in the world
is really just about not being you know
with the government's allowed
interpretation
so there's slowly it looks like they're
they're sticking it in some other
legislation kind of kind of slowly walk
it back
but at least as we walk back
however you can't be too happy about it
because it existed in the first place
in modern times
In Our Lifetime that existed that was a
real thing that was a real law and still
is by the way they just haven't reversed
it yet
I mean the the the level of wrongness
that we've experienced in less than five
years or so I think it's unprecedented
now I saw a scientific study that is
being questioned so we don't know if
it's true that the human brain has
shrunk
in the past I don't know however many
thousands of years
and that we used to have bigger brains
you know right before the ice age or
something so our brains used to be
bigger than others smaller
do you know what that would explain
what would that explain if our brains in
fact gotten smaller
now the answer is everything it would
explain everything
yeah you know how we couldn't understand
how the Ancients could build pyramids
but we wouldn't know how to do it today
using their technology
what if they were just smarter
that's that's the whole story
it's like well if you're as smart as we
used to be you could have built a
pyramid too
maybe that's the whole answer
maybe the maybe the answer to what's
wrong with everything
is that we're Dumber and maybe there's
nothing else to it
I don't think so and the other
scientists
who are not part of this study or not so
sure that we're getting Dumber some of
them are saying oh yes generally
speaking the bigger the brain the
smarter you are but there could be an
exception where if you have more folds
it could be tighter and more compact
like a microchip so it might actually be
better
but there's one theory that says that
brains shrunk because we didn't need to
to think individually
the ones you can depend on other people
to remember things and do some of your
thinking for you sort of group thinking
that you didn't need as much individual
intelligence to stay alive
and that therefore it atrophied because
you didn't need this so much not buying
that
so what should you believe about this
new study about brain shrinking
nothing including the fact that they
shrunk because even that's questioned
other people say you can't really
measure the size of a brain back then
because you know it's not preserved and
blah blah blah you can't really tell
so ignore all that so here's the CNN
narrative on Trump courtesy of Stefan
Collinson
and by the way I try to predict who the
opinion piece will be based on the title
so I look at the title of the opinion
piece before you see the name associated
you try to guess which which person it
is and this one I as soon as I saw I was
like that looks like Stephen colinson to
me sure enough
um
here are some things it says
the Republican front runner meaning
Trump his Stark speech
they're saying Stark instead of dark
I think we embarrassed them off dark
and so it's now it's turned Stark
so it's very Stark
uh the Front Runners Stark speech raised
the prospect of a second presidency that
would be even more extreme and
challenging to the rule of law than his
first
now do you believe that you could
objectively make the case
that the Trump Administration
was just purely objectively
had more or less a disregard for law
than the Biden Administration
does anybody think that's the case
I can only think of one instance where
this is even a question and the one
instance is January 6 and January 6 is
an up it's a misinformation up by the
left it's not even real it's not even
real in the sense that obviously it
wasn't an Insurrection but half of the
country thinks you can overturn a
country with some paperwork and some
trespassing
so
so the the thing with the Democrats is
that they're so brainwashed to believe
that they're the good guys that you can
just put this out there like it's true
and you don't have to support it well
you know there's this one Administration
that was ignoring the law
and the Democrats go oh yeah oh yeah
thank goodness we've got an
Administration that just follows the law
now
is it amazing
to me it's just like mind-boggling
that there's even a possibility that
somebody thinks that they could measure
one administration's flouting of the law
compared to the other how in the world
would even compare
so that's uh brainwashing
propaganda Point number one is to make
you accept uncritically that one of them
is the honest one and we just started
from there well start from the
assumption that one is the honest side
now look at all these crimes whoa
yeah
how about we check that Assumption of
which one flouts the law
um
and Collison goes on to say that talk
about Trump his view that the Oval
Office confers unfettered powers
wait
so Stephen Collison on CNN wrote this
sentence about Trump his view that the
Oval Office confers unfettered powers
um what evidences are of that
exactly what evidence is there of his
internal unspoken thoughts
it's just put here like it's a fact
yes mind reading it's mind reading once
you by the way I'll say this again once
I introduce the idea
that a lot of what you see in politics
is people pretending they could read
minds when obviously they can't
once you see it you see it everywhere
right the the mind reading phrase
it's like pervasive and why and then
once you realize that it's
um completely illegitimate speech
meaning that it's just somebody trying
to brainwash you it's not somebody who
has a like a real opinion
so let me finish this this is mind
blowing his view as if he could know
this his view that the Oval Office
confers unfettered Powers suggests Trump
would indulge in similar conduct as that
for which he is awaiting trial
all right so let's see if I can put this
all together because he's talking about
the January 6. so the fake accusations
about January 6
form a base completely fake accusations
that we see that if we read his mind
and we read his mind we see that he's
likely to do more of the thing that
never happened
because we read his mind
did I state that right they read his
mind Trump's mind and in it they can see
that he's likely to do more of the
things he's falsely accused of
that's called the news on the left
that's the news it's an opinion piece
but it's on a news site
well uh there's a lot of concern by the
people who care about AI that there will
be a an October surprise
you know that's the big news story that
you don't expect but of course you
always expect that before before an
election the October before the election
so that not this not this year but one
year from this October they will have an
AI inspired deep fake that will be
convincing enough that will change the
election
now here's my question
I feel as if this could go either way
we might have reached the point where
people will stop looking at photos and
videos
suppose
you had a site that wouldn't show you
any of it they wouldn't show you a video
and they would never show you a picture
they would only describe it
that would be as close as you could get
to real news because videos and pictures
lie they're the biggest Liars
so I feel like if I knew a human wrote
the story
and there were no pictures or videos to
distract me and lie to me
that might be closer to real but also if
there's no picture of video it's easier
to lie
so there's no real good good solution
here
um
but what do you think do you think that
there will be a deep fake October
surprise I say no
and the reasons I say no there'll be
lots of attempts
so there'll be plenty of default
attempts but I think we'll be so on to
the fakes that we will be primed to see
everything is fake even when it's not I
think it's more likely we'll think a
real thing is fake
oh okay here's my prediction here's my
prediction it's more likely we'll think
a real thing was faked
then we'll think a fake thing was real
anybody want to take the other side of
that bet it'd be hard to prove but look
look for a situation where there's a
real thing
that one side or the other believes is
fake
I think that's slightly more likely than
actually believing a deep fake now we
might believe a deep fake for a day
but we wouldn't believe a deep fake for
two days if we're following if we're
watching the news because it would get
debunked pretty quickly
and then I think that AI will be able to
detect AI
so we should have pretty quickly an AI
That's a watchdog of other AI
hey do you know why there's no such
thing as an AI fact check
isn't that the obvious thing if chat GPT
can do search
shouldn't it also be able to watch your
posts on social media and automatically
add a fact check
it already it we have that ability right
now right how hard would it be it would
be somewhat easy
do you know why you don't see it
why is there no chat GPT fact check
because the Democrats can't control it
they they do know that chat GPT is
biased toward the left but not in every
way
not in every way it still will give you
facts sometimes
so if you let Chachi BT do an automatic
fact checking it would destroy the
Democratic Party
because their entire operation involves
gaslighting their own team
it just doesn't work on the other side
because the other side is you know
there's sort of primed to reject
everything that comes from this side
just automatically so it doesn't work
except for their own team
but what would happen if they thought
chat GPT was real it's real enough
and that it kept disagreeing with their
own team
there's no way the Democrats can allow
chat GPT to become or AI in general to
be part of the public conversation
unless they've biased it so badly that
it can't possibly be useful
just think about that so that's my
prediction
my prediction is Democrats will never
allow
AI to be part of fact checking unless
they've corrupted it so badly that it
can't really do the fact checking
anybody want to take the other side of
that prediction you don't want to take
the other side of that one there will
never be
an AI
fact Checker approved by democrats
it can't happen just think about that
fact so this is going to be the biggest
dog not barking
once it becomes like incredibly clear to
every citizen that chat GPT could
identify the
you're going to ask why it's not doing
it
uh if it can identify fakes and
and uh you know facts that are just to
spend and of course I could do that
why why aren't we massively using it
that doesn't mean it will get everything
right it could just flag things you
should look into more deeply
but wouldn't that be useful yeah look
how useful the community notes are on
the X platform the best thing ever the
community notes where they they add the
contacts because the community notes do
not seem to be targeting one side would
you agree
if you've watched any the the community
notes have taken down people on the left
and the right
it's just the fact is the fact
so
yeah I think that's the most I think the
community notes are the most successful
fact-checking process
so far
all right
um
Jake Tapper uh looks like he's trying to
get Elon Musk assassinated or jailed uh
because he's pushing a narrative via his
questioning he's pushing the narrative I
was talking to Tony blinken
and he says I'll paraphrase but Jake
Tapper said that musk effectively
sabotaged a military attack against a
U.S Ally
now his version of it is that musk
deactivated the Skylink satellites his
own satellites that Ukraine was using
and they were planned to use it for a
maritime attack which would have been
essentially a Pearl Harbor attack on the
Russian Fleet
before the Russian Fleet you know I
don't think they're all in one place now
so so there was at one point during the
early part of the war when the fleet was
in one place or a lot of it and
a an attack of that size would have made
musk uncomfortable because he says he
talked to some high-ranking Russians who
threatened nuclear response if things
got too bad and that that looked like it
was possibly a nuclear trigger
and that musk himself apparently decided
that he would not turn on those
satellites and there's some difference
in the reporting the way the way Tapper
describes it it sounds like he turned
them off
but indeed they were never on in the
first place so they were actually asking
him to participate
in something that could have started
World War III and he said no
he just said no
uh
he never he never promised coverage over
Crimea because he thought Crimea was a
red red and now the uh
blinken quite wisely I thought he
handled it well instead of saying
anything good or bad about musk or what
he did or did not do blinken just said
and this is the right answer this you
know I've I'm not a big blinking fan
but he gave the exact right answer he
said we think Skylink is important has
been important and will be important to
the the future in our war
and then you know and then Tapper tried
to humiliate him for avoiding the
question
to which I say thank you for avoiding
that question
I I wanted you to avoid that question I
wanted you to say Skylake is important
and we're going to keep using it where
we can
that's all I want to hear
I don't want to hear you say anything
about an American citizen
who's trying to help every way he can
I don't want to hear any criticisms
about him in that context I mean
criticism is fun but not in that context
so blinken played that exactly right
because you don't want to piss off musk
if he controls the biggest asset in the
sky uh
but to watch Jake Tapper frame this in a
way that would
get musk killed or jailed
is probably one of the least ethical
things I've ever seen in my life
would you agree
if anybody saw the clip did it look like
the least moral and ethical ethically
responsible thing you've ever seen
and the idea here is that musk was doing
his own foreign policy
which would be illegal
now at what point is talking to somebody
else
foreign policy
where is it the fact that he didn't turn
on the satellites as a foreign policy if
I don't give you assets for your for
your military stuff is that interfering
am I doing my own foreign policy if I
decide not to go kill people you want me
to kill
that's my own foreign policy
yeah refusing to help in a war that
doesn't look legitimate
to some people that would be foreign
policy
well let me say this
uh we would have a big conversation
about what foreign policy means because
do you think I've never talked to
anybody in another country
that's what the x-platform does it
allows people in other countries to DM
me
are there not plenty of public figures
and I would be one of them who have had
conversations with people in other
countries in which they tell me things
that inform my opinion
you know many cases I don't believe them
because it looks like propaganda but
we're not allowed to talk to people in
other countries
under under what conditions are we not
allowed to talk to other people
because I'm not aware of any law that
would prevent me from talking to anybody
under any conditions
who can tell me who I can talk to in
another country
is there a law about that
I you know if it's my job to go over
there and influence them that's
something but I can't have a
conversation
where where I learn things and they
learn things that are you know not
secrets
yeah you know there's it's one thing to
be I guess Carrie was kind of
negotiating with Iran somebody said so I
mean that's the real kind that might be
a problem but if all must did is talk to
a bunch of high-ranking Russians and
they told them something that is a
little bit obvious you know that they
would consider nukes under some
situations and then he acted on that
how is that wrong
like what what kind of law did that
violate
not wanting to be involved in starting
World War III is doing your own foreign
policy
that's quite a stretch
so to me it looks like um
powers on the left are ganging up to
take Trump or to take Moscow I think
that they need him gone in order for
their
um propaganda gaslighting machine to
work because if you can't get the
x-platform to go long
it's a little more obvious what you're
up to
well let's talk about Nikki Haley whose
prospects seem to be rising a lot of
people are liking her
but she is a pro uh or in Ukraine and
funding it whereas Trump and Vivek to
name two would be a little more
aggressive in trying to wind down that
war and get us out of there but
she said a win for Russia in that war is
a win for China
do you see that a win for Russia is a
win for China
that feels like a
like a weak reason
doesn't it
there's something about that reason that
makes me think she doesn't have a reason
yeah it's like why do you have to
stretch you're giving billions of
dollars for a war and you've got to come
up with some
third-party effect for why it's
important
there's not a first party effect as in
people dying right now and it either
does make us safer or not in terms of
Russia but but the real concern is China
is she just bad at explaining things or
is that her actual reason
I know I I feel like her explanations of
the Ukraine situation
I'm not saying that they're wrong
but they're at the very least poorly
explained and I don't think you could
have a war
that's poorly explained
like that feels like really important to
explain it accurately
so yeah this whole win for Russia is a
win for China
that's a little too thin that's some
weak soup right there
which is different from saying we should
or should not fund them all right I have
my opinions on that but what we're
talking about now is just this
explanation just doesn't even feel real
it sounds like somebody had to sit down
and think it up all right can you come
up with a reason why we're funding this
war well
Russia well uh we'll let's see we'll be
safer from rush now we're not going to
be safer from Russia we'll actually be
in more Danger from Russia so the reason
would be to save you create well now
Ukraine's totally destroyed so it's not
it's not about saving Ukraine
um it's about making sure that NATO is
not really I mean it's not really about
NATO
so I feel like it was somebody who had
to come up with a
an essay for a college class
and he had to say something that
somebody hadn't said already oh I think
I'll write an essay well
let's say I'll I'll talk about the third
third effect you know Downstream
I mean it doesn't even it just doesn't
seem real
it sounds like CIA
let's just say what it sounds like it
sounds like somebody in a propaganda job
came up with this ridiculous
you know China is really about that
Russia is really about China
and Ukraine is really about China
I'm sorry
nope nope yeah did you know what you'll
never see now you'll definitely see
somebody like Vivek say that you know we
should be focusing on China and it's not
helping us to be focused over here
that's a lot different
than saying a win for Russia is a win
for China that those don't sound the
same to me
but I get the fact that our focus is in
the wrong place but
um well wait a minute I've got this
backwards so Vivek is saying we should
get out
because being there
is good for China and Nikki Haley is
saying we should stay there and fund it
because getting out would be good for
China
so so there are two major Republicans
who can't even tell you for sure well
one of them's right but we don't know
which one's right I'm not smart enough
so we can't even tell if a war
is good or bad for our main let's say
competition in China
that's a pretty fundamental problem do
you know what I say when you can't
decide if a war is good or bad for you
how do you handle it when you can't
decide if it's good or bad for you
you don't do it
you don't do a war if you're not sure
right unless it's a defensive war and
then you're sure
but that's pretty scary even the
Republicans can't don't know why we're
there
yeah
here's a little uh interesting tidbit
um there's a drug called mementine
that's given to adults with uh
dementia it's a Memory drug so it's
already approved existing memory drug
and there's some newer studies that say
it might be useful for reducing ADHD
and
um
but hold on
but you won't be able to find this in
the news
do you know why
why would you not be able to find that
there's an existing drug
that maybe and by the way you should not
take any medical advice from me I'm not
I'm not making the claim that it works
I'm not making the claim that it works
how would I know I'm not a doctor do not
take any drugs because you heard it on
the show
all right let's be clear
I'm just spitballing here there's no
medical advice
however
there
there are at least some doctors who work
in the field who are pretty sure that
it's having some effect
why is it that if you did a search for
it would be hard to find that
could it be that there's some other drug
that makes a lot of money
that is the current thing that works for
ADHD
could it be there's some other drug
so here's how you understand drug news
if if you do a search and it says hey
there's this one drug that everybody
should use for this situation it
probably means that whoever sells that
drug did a good job of managing the
search engine optimization so that their
thing comes up and anything else doesn't
come up now as you know I gave you a
direct example of this the other day
where there's something I have personal
knowledge of because I am in fact cured
by surgery on my throat but if you
searched for my condition
good luck going way down the search to
find the known cure
instead you will find out that Botox is
the gold standard of treatment
which in fact is by far
a less good
um
cure
than the surgery now the surgery doesn't
work for every person so there's some
risk to it but the botox doesn't work
for every person either
so so we do know with some certainty I
can tell you with personal experience
that
the the search engine optimization for
drugs that work
doesn't work
so that the search engines are all
um they're all owned they're essentially
been neutered by the drug companies
so if there were a drug and I'm not
saying there were there is I just this
is just one story
uh you wouldn't know about it
so your social media would prevent you
from knowing about cures that would
totally change your life like really
change your life
imagine having ADHD that wasn't properly
treated
and that you wouldn't know that there
was something out there that could help
you maybe again don't take my word for
it I'm not a doctor
but the the level of evil that we're
seeing because when it comes to medical
stuff
regular marketing
shouldn't even be legal
because the way the way you Market a
normal consumer product is you say ours
is the best and the other person sucks
and that doesn't even necessarily need
to be true
you might not have the best one it might
be overpriced your competition might
have a better one but we're kind of used
to that when it's just some consumer of
good
but when it comes to life and death
like that your quality of life is below
the worth living point but it could be
above it if you simply have this little
information about what would make you
better and the search engines will just
bury that
not intentionally perhaps it's just
maybe gaming from the from the people
who are trying to game it but uh
it's just so unethical it's almost hard
to keep it in your head
anyway
there's this new book on musk it's a
biography by Walter Isaacson and musk
himself must be happy about it because
I saw him sending a post in which he was
recommending a interview with Walter
Isaacson
without even seeing it because he said
everything that guy says is kind of
interesting so they like each other
apparently so that that's good to know
just when you're right when you're
trying to evaluate how true the
biography is it's good to know that the
biographer and the subject got along and
uh yeah I guess Walter Isaacson was
talking to Lex and Friedman
and on a podcast which probably be quite
interesting I would imagine
there's a few anecdotes coming out and
one of the one of them is about the
relationship between Elon Musk and Bill
Gates
which you might know
is not ideal
now the funniest thing about this was
that they didn't always know each other
isn't that weird that only a few years
ago they seemed to have met for the
first time
how is that even possible
how did Elon Musk and Bill Gates not end
up in the same room
just naturally a bunch of times
without even trying
yeah
um
so by the way my trigonometry podcast is
up today apparently
trigonometry look for that if you know
that it's one of the best podcasts
um
so here are some things we learned from
the biography that uh musk was really
mad at gates for shorting Tesla stock
now if you're not an investor
a short is a bet that the stock will
plunge and go down and then you can make
money by betting against the stock so
you can either buy a stock and make
money when it goes up or you can do
what's called selling a short
where you make money when it goes down
but that's considered putting pressure
on a stock like if somebody buys a big
short it makes other people say well
what do you know that I don't know so
it's a big pressure on the stock price
so it's kind of a messed up thing to do
if you're the person who owns a lot of
stock in that company
and so musk apparently challenged him
when Gates wanted to bring one of his
children to watch a launch
uh oh here's a sub category there's part
of the story that's also interesting
when gase wanted to schedule with musk
to bring Gates kid to see launch or see
a rocket or something uh musk told them
that he fired his schedulers because he
didn't like them having too much control
over his schedule so that to schedule
with him you'd have to call him directly
to like call his phone number
so Bill Gates wanted to schedule it and
have his secretary set it up but he
couldn't send his secretary to call musk
directly
because I would just sort of be
inappropriate so he had to you had to
schedule it himself so Bill Gates called
musk and scheduled it
so apparently when they got together uh
one of there was some disagreement about
whether there could ever be a
Tesla semi truck
I just saw one
so it must said it would be impossible
to use battery power to make a the big
semi trucks
and I think musk was saying that they
were already running at the time that he
said that it were impossible they were
like already up and running and you know
and now they're in lots of places I saw
one yesterday or the other day
so I guess Gates was completely wrong
about the um capability of the batteries
and
it turns out that musk can knew a lot
more about batteries than Gates does
surprise and that
gase was just totally wrong about
everything about Tesla and his and his
potential Now musk's problem
is that gase is not just a guy who's
investing to make money and so he asked
him reportedly musk asked Gates why he
would have a short on the one company
that is doing the most
to get us away from fossil fuels
and Gates basically said he did it to
make money
he bet against the most important
anti-fossil fuel company the one that
would be doing doing the most
to make fossil fuels unnecessary he bet
against it
in a way that could damage it like
severely
to make money
and he said it directly
yeah he just did it to make money
so
um
and then I guess the quote from musk
after learning this was must said in a
note to somebody at this point I am
convinced that he meaning Gates is
categorically insane and then I then
parenthetically in an to the
Core
Ed buff said I did actually want to like
him Psy
so in person Elon Musk says he's either
crazy
or just an who doesn't care
about anything
so
um so now I know you're going to extend
this and you're going to say Buzz Scott
you said he doesn't invest just to make
money
you said he's you know using his fortune
to make the world a better place and
haven't I've been telling you that he's
he's evil and he's trying to destroy the
world
I don't think you could use this example
to make that case here's why
you don't think that the previous
richest person in the world has any bad
feelings about the current richest
person in the world
you don't think the gates and musk have
a personal situation that is primarily
what's driving them
and that has nothing to do with anything
else the gates does anywhere else
yeah to me it just looked personal it
just looked like uh Gates lost his Mojo
to musk musk is now the the better Gates
basically
because when I grew up Bill Gates was
the the standard of you know high-tech
entrepreneurial success but he's not at
the moment
at the moment that's musk so imagine
going most of your life being the guy
like you're the guy for technology and
now there's another the guy
and and you're getting all this trouble
for your personal Behavior Etc
I don't know to me it just looked
personal
I I think that Gates would have been
happy to see a Tesla go down
because it would have made Gates look
smarter
but I don't think you could take that
which is pretty ugly
and extended to the reason he's making
toilets in Africa is to make money
that's a pretty big stretch
but people are people are complex so
they're neither all good nor all bad
yeah yeah it just seems personal to me
so I'd say I doubt he's insane but uh
 to the core appears to be
consistent with what people have said
about gates from the first days I would
never argue that he's not an
you didn't hear that did you I've never
made that case
I'm not saying that if you were there in
person
you'd be a good guy
I doubt it
I was watching uh last night I was
watching a special on Frank Sinatra
and
here's something I didn't know about
Frank Sinatra
in my opinion his greatest
accomplishments we never talk about like
if you think of Frank Sinatra you think
oh
you know a great singer and he was in
movies and successful and stuff but it
turns out that his maybe most awesome
accomplishments had nothing to do with
those things those things allowed him to
be Frank Sinatra so he could do the
other things
for example he had in his little rack
pack you know his group of guys included
um
uh Sammy Davis Jr
now in the days in the 50s Sammy Davis
Jr couldn't even stay at the hotels
where they performed
he wasn't allowed to stay there or or to
eat there or something yeah because the
racism was so that bad but because
Sinatra was so powerful
he would just go in and say yes you are
you absolutely going to change that
you know no discrimination when I'm here
Sammy is going to be treated like
everybody else and they would just force
people to do it so he was one of the
biggest forces
for you know realistic diversity in in
entertainment at least and also the
world so he basically went to the mat
against
um discrimination
but there was another story that I
hadn't heard until I watched this so
apparently at the time that Sinatra had
moved to Palm Springs I think it was
Palm Springs
and other rich people wanted to spend
some time there too it was just a good
place for rich people but a lot of the
rich Jewish
actors and Hollywood people
couldn't even join the big Golf Club in
Palm Springs I don't know how many there
were but there was one big one that they
would want to be a member of but they
were not allowed
so they were Rich enough they decided to
start their own Golf Club so that all
the the Jewish members could play but it
wouldn't be restricted so you didn't
have to be Jewish it's just that they
wouldn't restrict anybody so it ended up
being you know lots of Jewish members
well Frank Sinatra who is not Jewish
um
he actually moved his home
onto the golf course
so that Frank Sinatra was basically
endorsing you know this this new
Arrangement that was not discriminating
against his friends
so if you if you and it was a big a very
apparently especially for the area it
was a big statement like his statement
was if this club isn't going to let my
friends in you're not going to see me
there
and seeing Frank Sinatra was sort of a
big deal so so he put the hammer down on
two very you know notable uh situations
in which he would not tolerate
discrimination
and to me that was his his greater
accomplishments but this is not even why
I was going to talk about it
I was going to talk about him because he
was also a miserable drunk
and apparently he was just terrible to
people when he was drunk and he really
liked to drink so it wasn't that
uncommon
but when you watch the people talk about
him they talked like they were seeing a
God it's like oh my God he was so nice
and apparently he did just
incredible amount of charity work like
for individuals but also for
organizations he did like just all kinds
of Charities saying he said yes to
everything so he was in fact
a genuine charitable guy who did things
which I think could have changed history
I mean it might might be that important
uh
but he could also be
a pretty mean guy
so how do you handle the fact that
somebody is sometimes terrible
and sometimes an angel and he can be
both guys it could be both people
and I think you have to keep that in
mind when you're looking at any you know
anybody like Bill Gates
so if you want to say that he's like
pure evil that doesn't feel likely to me
that feels really unlikely but if you
told me that everything he does is noble
and for the good of humanity I would say
clearly not
clearly not
but he could be both
he could be one of the most useful
people to Society and also an
there's not there's no competition there
he could be both
I speak from personal experience
I like to do things that help the world
but am I flawless
no
obviously
all right people are complex that's my
only point
um
do you remember when Forbes the
publication was a respectable
publication
oh my God I don't know what happened
but oh my God
so there's an article here about how
the Richer more unethical than the poor
the rich are more unethical and immoral
than the poor it's in Forbes
this informed
and here are the examples
without any
no believable data to back it
that the rich have lacks attitude toward
the rules so they're more prone to break
laws while driving
hinting at a belief that certain rules
might not apply to them
yeah because when I'm afraid of a crime
for example I don't want to be around
rich people
yeah no if you want to be free from
crime go to the poorest part of the
country
because that's where people are
morally strong
you can leave your door unlocked just go
to any inner city just leave your door
unlocked because there are no rich
people there to take your stuff because
they're all immoral there's rich people
the rich also according to the Forbes
article it's an opinion piece of I guess
skewed ethical compasses yeah because
that's something that the rich have but
not the poor they're inconsiderate yeah
they're richer inconsiderate unlike the
poor
who just
they they're so considerate
and the rich have something called an
overemphasis on winning
whether in games or work
yeah those those stupid rich people they
have an over emphasis on winning
so you wouldn't want any of that around
you would you let me get away from those
winners my God
now do it do I even need to add
commentary to this
this is Forbes
and they're basically saying kill rich
people
indirectly I mean all the the rich
people are the bad people so if you did
something bad to uh if he did something
bad to a rich person well that would not
even be immoral would it because they
have it coming they're all they're all
bad people
my God
do you think that the uh the left is
trying to kill Trump and musk like
actually kill them
uh I don't know if anybody's had a
meeting where they said those words
but if you were to judge by actions
it looks like it
it looks exactly like it
you know you want to hear here's my
conspiracy theory
I'm going to give you the conspiracy
theory of all conspiracy theories I will
not say that I believe my own conspiracy
theory and therefore you should
but when a situation is created
we're we're led to a certain set of
conclusions whether you like it or not
and the thing that's been bugging me for
a long time is the UFO stories
and I've told you before that if I were
in charge of the let's say some massive
brainwashing operation
I would want to know if I could test
when the public is ready for the the big
one
and the UFOs would be this nice little
silly story that no matter which way it
went it would just be kind of funny
so it wouldn't hurt you so you put this
UFO story out and then you wait a few
weeks and you see how many people
believed it
now I don't know the answer to that can
you tell me what percentage of the
public believed the UFO story less than
half
not 25 but it was fewer than half was it
not fewer than half believed it was true
I did a fact check on that you're just
guessing all right so here's my
conspiracy theory
that if 75 percent of the country had
believed the UFO story
then the brainwashers in charge would
know that we're ready for the big one
and the big one would be assassination
the big one would be assassination
and that because the UFO story was not
bought hook line and sinker that they
pulled back on the plan to kill Trump
and they may have they may have the same
plan for musk for all I know but now I'm
not saying this is true
not saying this is true I'm just saying
that if you remove any uh Trust in Media
we're all left with our own devices
so we're all going to look for patterns
and then we're going to think those
patterns mean something they don't
a lot of times the patterns are just you
know accidental patterns
uh but I'll tell you the pattern I see
with the the Forbes thing
this basically is trying to change the
public's opinion
of how much they think about the rich
people
now who do you think of when you think
of rich people
Trump and Musk
like they're they're defined by being
rich people
so if you can make rich people look like
they're the bad ones
and you can make the public believe
anything including UFOs
you can just kill the rich people if
they're in your way
and then you can tell the public that it
was an accident
and 75 will believe
20 25 won't believe but it's not enough
to change it
the 25 was probably how many believe
that Kennedy was killed by the CIA
for most of my life probably 25 percent
of the public thought the CIA killed
Kennedy
right
so that was enough that Society did not
rise up because 25 just isn't enough
75 said let's let's just move on
probably one gunman
right so that's what scares me about the
UFO story
it looks like it's planted it didn't
look organic to me and it looked like
there would be some point to it
and the only other point I could think
would be to scare China or Russia into
thinking we have some technology that
they don't know about
maybe I mean that's another plausible
explanation but I it feels like a test
to see if we're ready to believe
literally anything
you you would have to get us to Kennedy
levels of
trust in the system before you can
listen to the system say oh no problem
it was one bullet it was a Magic Bullet
but it was just one
yeah because remember the public
believes the Magic Bullet
for most of my life
they believe there was a Magic Bullet
that just like
went through the
and still do yeah
yeah I don't know how many bullets there
were but
maybe we'll never know so that's what
scares me
um
[Music]
and that's the reason the the study says
all these unethical Tendencies according
to the psychologist is why the rich uh
can succeed in life but fail in love
so the rich fell in love because they're
not trusted
that's not why the rich fell in love
would anybody like me to explain to them
why the rich
fell in love
there's anybody who doesn't know the
obvious answer that
because we can afford it
we can afford it
why is this a mystery
rich people have the most options
so you have the most temptation
and the let's say the wife if you take a
classic situation with a richer guy and
marries somebody a a woman who marries a
rich guy doesn't have to put up with any
chance
because they're going to get enough
money even with a prenup
even with a pre-dop there's going to be
some bag of money involved so
all you do is change the financial
incentives and you would get this result
and this psychologist thinks it has
something to do with trust
has nothing to do with trust it has to
do with follow the money follow the
money Works 100 of the time
and the money suggests that getting
married to a rich guy and then divorcing
the rich guy is a really good deal
because then you could have money plus a
guy you like better
why wouldn't everybody do it I don't
know how any rich people stay buried
to me it would be a miracle if anybody
ever stayed married to a rich person
yeah because the money suggests that you
shouldn't so they don't
it's as simple as that
all right uh the ukrainians have uh
I didn't know this but they've developed
a substantial uh weapons manufacturing
capacity
didn't see that coming but apparently
the ukrainians can make a lot of weapons
now uh locally
uh big ones we're talking about
artillery now they're made out of
plastic and wood and they don't fire any
shells they're used for decoys
so Ukraine has this massive decoy
military and Industrial process where
they're making where they're making
decoys to use up the Russian Artillery
so that they're all happy about their
fake fake
Radars and stuff yeah so they just make
it out of wood and they spray paint it
and they wait for the Russians to
destroy it
now
on one hand I think this is awesome
pretty good strategy I'm sure it works
yeah it's using up their their weapons
on the other side on the other hand I
don't know if I would bet on the group
that needed to make wooden weapons
I'm just gonna say if there if there if
there's any way to determine who's
winning and who's losing a war
I would look to the one that had to make
weapons out of cardboard
right if one side is making weapons out
of cardboard and plastic bottles
they are not going to be the winner
right again I remind you I'm no military
analyst
but if I were a military analyst
I would not place a large bat on the
people who were making weapons out of
wood
that's just me
they did the same thing during World War
One and Two they did
they did
yeah I'm not saying it's a bad strategy
I'm just saying it doesn't sound like
the Winner's strategy it sounds like in
addition that the other side has better
better weapons
because I don't think Russia is doing
that do you think Russia is making a
bunch of wooden artillery they don't
need to because they have so much of the
real stuff
yeah I mean it's just an indicator of
what's happening there
all right I was asked uh on the locals
platform somebody asked me what's the
difference between affirmations and
wishful thinking
so an affirmation is when you're
Imagining the thing you want to be true
as an aid to making it true
and visual thinking is just when you
wish you had something
and my answer is this
wishful thinking is just wanting
affirmations is closer to deciding
because if You Can chant or write down
or visualize this goal every single day
you probably decided
because you just wouldn't do that
unless you had really committed yourself
to it because the affirmations are sort
of the last thing you do
sometimes at first but typically you
know you're already trying to do
something in that regard you're trying
to make something happen and then you
say all right how about affirmations
so affirmations are a pretty good sign
because you're going to do it every day
that you're committed to this thing
wishful thinking is like me thinking
well you know if I were Elon Musk what
would I do today
right but I'm not trying to make myself
Elon Musk
it's just uh wouldn't that be fun and
then you watch a movie and you see
somebody's having a good life you say oh
wouldn't that be fun but that's just
wanting
and there's no faith involved in either
case
let me be clear believing and having
some faith has nothing to do with any
wishful thinking there's no faith
required for wishful thinking but
there's no faith required or belief for
affirmations
the idea behind affirmations which may
be not even true
is that the simple process of
concentrating on a goal makes it more
likely to happen
there are several ways that could be
true
way number one is that
there's some backwards causation
happening
and the way that works is if you can
spend 15 minutes a day
focusing on your objective
it probably means you already decided to
do whatever it takes to get there
so it's the deciding whatever it takes
to get there that was probably the
operational part
but by coincidence there's a correlation
between people who are going to do
whatever it takes
and people who would also do an
affirmation
so it could be the affirmations are just
attached to people who are going to do
whatever it takes so that you would see
a correlation between affirmations of
success then that would be the least
magical explanation right that would
just be pretty straightforward people
who do one thing are likely to do the
other thing as well
so it's not the other thing that's
predictive it's just associated
so that could explain it all I would be
one of those personalities
so my personality is once I've decided
to do something I'm going to do all of
the things you know I'm going to do all
of the things and one of them might be
affirmations
whether I think it works or not
because once I've decided I'm going to
do all the things I'm not going to leave
out any of the things
like if they might work
all right try it
so that could be one reason they appear
to work another would be that you
there's something called a reticular
activation I didn't make this up it has
to do with the fact that you notice
things that are relevant to you
and repeating a goal makes something
more relevant to you because it's at the
front of your mind
so whatever is at the front of your mind
tends to be the filter where you notice
things in your environment
for example if you if your best friend
bought a certain color and model of car
from that moment on the moment after you
saw your friend bought this car a
certain color model you'll see that car
everywhere
you get on the highway there's one
there's one and you never noticed before
it's because your friend's car moved to
the front of your mind and it became
your filter and now you're seeing things
that you just wouldn't have noticed
before because you changed your filter
that's how it works now suppose
that you did an affirmation about
becoming a famous cartoonist
and you didn't know how to do it
would you notice some opportunities that
you wouldn't have noticed before because
you set that in the front of your mind
well that's what made me a cartoonist
I literally was doing the affirmations
but didn't know how to become one and I
turned on the TV and I noticed
would I have noticed before
don't know I noticed there was a TV show
telling people how to be a cartoonist
now I missed the show and I wrote a
letter and asked some questions and that
got me started
but what I have even noticed if I hadn't
put that filter in the front of my mind
to become a cartoonist no no so it could
be just filtering for opportunity
there's a study by Dr Wiseman
who studied luck luck he wanted to see
if there was such a thing as luck there
isn't so it turns out nobody can guess
things better than other people
but he did this study I talk about all
the time where he asked people
to sort themselves by optimists and
pessimists
and then he gave them all the same tasks
which was to count the number of
photographs in a newspaper
so the pessimists counted the number of
photographs and on average they got the
right number let's say that was 42 just
to make up a number
and but it would take them several
minutes to go through the newspaper and
count them all up but they'd get the
right answer
the optimists would also get the right
answer
but it would take them seconds
they were done in seconds
but it took the others minutes
and the reason that the optimists were
done in seconds
on average again this is just on average
is that The Optimist noticed that on
page two of every newspaper in big
writing
is said stop counting the photographs
that were 42.
it was right there in big writing stop
counting them they're 42.
now the pessimists were not expecting
any luck
that's what pessimists are so they just
said one two character photographs three
Droopy Dog four five forty two
the optimists are always looking for
luck
all the time
something good is going to happen to me
something good is going to happen and
they're like all right let's start this
task
hey I guess I can stop I got some luck I
thought this was going to be boring but
look I got lucky page two it says stop
counting boom done
so Dr Weisman hypothesized that What's
Happening Here is that people who expect
luck are actually adjusting their filter
to see more of it
so is it possible that when I was
expecting good things to happen you know
to become a cartoonist that I just set
my filter for good luck and then I saw
it and then I saw some good luck
Maybe
the other possibility for why
affirmations could work is it just makes
you more serious about your goal you
basically talk yourself into being more
serious about it by thinking about it
and repeating it every day so it could
be just that maybe it makes you focus
better but the experience that people
have is almost magical
like there was some luck that that
popped up
maybe they're just noticing the luck
but here's the weirdest explanation
that we live in a simulation that this
reality of ours is a simulation
and that the way you navigate the
simulation
is by your intentions
your intentions
that's what an affirmation is an
affirmation is your intention
put into words
when you put an intention into words
what happens
words are the operating system of your
brain they're words just words so as
soon as your intention turns into a set
of words then you can reprogram your
brain the intention isn't good enough
you need you need to word it
reinsert it and repeat it and then it
becomes the code in your brain
that's what a reframe is
all right so my book
teaches you how to use words in a short
sentence to reprogram your brain there's
no effort involved you just read the
words you're done read it once and
that's all you have to do that's the
entire change read one sentence once
and there are 160 of those sentences
so
one possibility in the simulation
is that you're not just programming your
your brain with Words which would be
good
but there might be something even
weirder if we're a simulation
it could be that's the way we steer
within the simulation in other words
maybe we have lots of possibilities but
when you focus on one it actually veers
you into a reality in which it's true
so it's not that there's one reality and
there's one set of things that could
happen there are infinite dimensions and
you can through your affirmations move
your path off of a dimension that you're
heading toward and toward a different
one so you're not making something
happening
that's the way that's the way it feels
like affirmations feels like you made
your environment change
but what if the environment's never
changed
and all that happened was you moved to a
new one
that would be perfectly possible if
we're a simulation but not possible
under you know more normal understanding
of reality now given that I'm pretty
sure we are a simulation because the
odds are a trillion to one that were
anything but that
that's a longer discussion
um my understanding my operating
understanding of affirmations is that
it's a steering mechanism
to steer toward a reality that's more in
my my liking
so wishful thinking
is just some thinking about some good
things
there's no operational part to that it's
just thinking
once you have an intention
and that intention turns into words and
you either read it as a reframe such as
my book or you turn it into an
affirmation where you say I Scott Adams
will have a best-selling book
I actually use that one on my vessel
books and
uh so that would give you all the tools
you need to change dimensions
all right how many you just had to your
minds blown
and anybody's mind just blow up
laughs I love watching the comments when
I when I know something's happening yeah
yeah this is one of those moments when
you're saying to yourself
holy cow
yeah this is sort of a holy cow moment
isn't it now you understand my entire
life the the filter that I just
explained to you with affirmations and
the simulation and all that that's what
I live every day
that that's my everyday understanding of
my environment is what I explained
it's really nice
it's nice to live in that frame whether
I don't know what's true
maybe truth is beyond us but I can live
in that frame and it's really Pleasant
where because I feel like I'm changing
my environment but really I'm just
changing which environment I choose to
experience
and I would argue that there are other
forms of affirmations somebody mentioned
prayer
if you were if your frame is that
there's a
Supreme Being
and that praying to that Supreme Being
is the mechanism that causes the thing
to happen in your real life that could
be
nothing but another way to steer toward
another dimension you know one where the
things are happening that you want so it
could be that the god model works
perfectly well
or as well as affirmations because it
would be just a steering mechanism in
both cases
yeah but the but in my telling of things
the faith would be
um the faith would be unrelated to the
effectiveness you wouldn't need any
faith there's just a mechanical process
you could add Faith but it would it
would neither add to or detract from the
outcome
somebody says God works best I'm going
to agree with you because we're all
different
so I I very much think that for some
types of people the God prayer model is
exactly the right one and for other
types of people maybe some other model
is the one that works best
but I don't think it's I don't think
it's universally true
all right faith is not even close to
being mechanical that's what I said
right you think you're disagreeing with
it
no that's what I said
faith is not mechanical
but you would only need the mechanical
part to observe benefits the faith might
be additional but like you said they're
not the same don't think that the
mechanical process and Faith are related
the faith is extra
all right well that got everybody
thinking didn't it I think I'll leave
you on this don't believe anything in
the news
uh and uh I will talk to you
tomorrow
so I'm going to say goodbye to the folks
on the X platform first
and then YouTubers
I'll see you tomorrow
