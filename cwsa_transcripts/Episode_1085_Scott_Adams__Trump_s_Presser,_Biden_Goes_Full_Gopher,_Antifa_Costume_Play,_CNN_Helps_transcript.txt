well hello to all of you dog
pony soldiers too it's good that we
dog-faced pony soldiers could all come
together
and today could be an
amazing amazing coffee with scott adams
why well no reason
it's just going to be really good and
if you'd like to enjoy it to its fullest
let me recommend that what you need is a
copper micro glass attacker challenger
stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything
better including shadow banning
sip go
ah the simultaneous sip
does get better every time
first time i told you that you thought
oh scott it can't get better every time
i mean sooner or later you're going to
have one that's subpar
but no never happens one time after
another the simultaneous sip
crushes it well
um the biggest news uh and
i don't know how many of you had this on
your predict it
but uh it seems that the
candidate for the libertarian party was
bitten by a possibly rabid
bat and
and why wouldn't she be because it's 20
20.
in 2020 if the simulation isn't going to
serve you up a major candidate for
president who was bit by a
maybe rabid bat well then the simulation
is not trying
and i think it's trying this year oh is
it trying
we've had more news this year than
well all the other years put together
multiplied by three let's talk about
some of that news
today the headlines on fox news are all
a bunch of fake news
so fox has gone full fake news on the
bill clinton
um epstein island stuff and here's what
i mean
by fake news do i know if bill clinton
was ever on the island i do not
do i know that it wasn't on the island
i do not but what i do know is that the
person who the
and as far as i can tell the only
evidence they use on the
on the island is from what i'd call an
unreliable witness
the same person who accuses um
who accuses dershowitz of being there
and dershowitz has pointed out that her
credibility
is whatever is less than zero
so if you here's my problem with fox
news on their coverage
what they're covering is true
what they're leaving out is almost
criminal
what they're leaving out is that the one
accuser who saw bill clinton on that
island
has no credibility none
and there's a background for that ellen
dershowitz
does it i think the key reason that you
should be aware of
is that i think she also accused al gore
of being there
and i believe that there is a body of
records proving that he was not there
in the times that she said he was so
if caught in one lie that is identical
to the type of lie
well the type of accusation
that's a zero credibility situation
that's not a well she got one wrong
before but that doesn't mean she's wrong
about everything else
no it's a zero it's a zero credibility
which doesn't mean it didn't happen
remember we live in a anything's
possible world where
candidates for president can be re
bitten by
a possibly rabid bat
so nothing's off the table i'm just
saying that if you run this story
without very prominently saying the only
evidence
it has zero credibility that's just fake
news
so if you think your fake news is only
coming to you from the left
there's a prime example of fox news
faking it up for you
and again the news is accurate but
leaving out that context just turns it
into fake news
in my opinion
so here's a story that should worry the
hell on you
so one of my followers and might be on
this periscope right now
d d texas grandma 65
grandma spelled gma noted that
she was following me but then somehow
got unfollowed
so automatically unfollowed so this
prompted me to circle back to a story
that
i'd been talking about maybe a year ago
i can't remember
in which i noticed that i had been
unfollowed from
ambassador grinnell richard grinnell now
i don't know what title you would give
him ex-ambassador
or do you still call them ambassadors
after they're not ambassadors
i don't know what the rule on titles is
but you know what i'm talking about
he was he was acting out of the dni for
a while
but i had been unfollowed from him
i think twice and so a year ago i'd
asked if other people had been
unfollowed and turns out there wasn't a
massive number of people
in the comments said oh yeah i just
checked
i was totally at following him and now
i'm not
so i decided to recheck that so a year
has gone by
just to see if it's still happening and
sure enough
i don't know i don't know if it's like a
new wave of unfollows or if it's still
some trickle from the past
but once again my comments were filled
with people who said
what the i was following
but now i'm not and now i had to follow
him back again
and so i thought i would just test one
more account
just to see if i could guess somebody
who is likely
to have the same situation and the
criteria i used was
okay what is it about ambassador
and or richard grinnell again i don't
know
i don't know how the titles work for
ambassador but let's say he's always an
ambassador if he ever was one
let's let's go with that standard um
so i thought you know what does he have
in common
or what is there about him that would
make him a target for this and the
obvious answer is that he's a
unusually good public spokes
spokesperson supporting president trump
and i thought all right well i'll pick
somebody else who is in that category
of an unusually good communicator in
favor of
president trump so i did a second tweet
this morning
asking people how many had been
unfollowed
from back gates so congressman gates
and turns out a lot
a lot now keep in mind the people who
are answering
are just the people who see my twitter
feed and
also followed back gates and also saw
that tweet
and also checked you know and
also thought to put a comment about it
so
if i can turn up that many people in
[Music]
60 seconds who can who say oh yeah that
happened to me
is it possible they're all imagining
that
i mean it is possible by the way
it is possible it is completely within
the realm of possibility that we're all
imagining it
but i don't think so i don't think so
it would be quite shocking if it were
the case but actually you can't rule it
out
i'm going to give you another hypothesis
which i also do not rule out
but i think it could be ruled out pretty
quickly if i just ask people on
twitter and it goes like this
at least one person has had the
following experience
on an android device and the claim is
this
that there's something about the app
running on an
android device and i don't know if it's
every android device
every release i don't know if it's the
app or if they're using the browser to
get to it
so there's a lot i don't know but the
claim is this
and you've had this experience have you
ever had the experience where
you're in some kind of an app it doesn't
have to be twitter
and you go to click something and just
before you click it the screen moves
and you click the wrong thing how many
times does that happen
probably a lot right you your finger is
moving in to
press a button and then the screen
scrolls and you press the wrong button
you're like ah
wrong button i deleted a couple of
messages yesterday
by wrong finger in them anyway so
there's a belief
or let none not a belief a hypothesis
there's a hypothesis that there might be
one
one interface situation where people are
automatically unfollowing who do not
mean to do so
but how likely is that
i don't think any of that explains it to
me it looks like
the a hypothesis has to be
that there is some way that somebody is
influencing twitter could be somebody
from the outside
doesn't have to be an insider it could
be somebody from the outside
but something's happening clearly we
don't know if it's
third party apps because that's my other
hypothesis
when you sign up for some third-party
apps say
tick doc just to pick a random example
i'll just randomly pick tick tock let's
say you had the tick tock app
and you wanted to sometimes share your
tick tocks on twitter
well i believe it asks you if if tick
tock can have control of your twitter
account
yeah think about that that gives the
chinese government
control i think i would need a fact
check on this
but if you have tick tock and twitter
both apps on your phone and you've told
tick tock you can
manage your twitter some of your twitter
actions
could the chinese government through
tick tock
cause you to unfollow ambassador
grinnell
could it i think yes
but i would need some kind of a fact
check on that
all right um yesterday
twitter purged a bunch bunch of accounts
you saw a lot of people complaining hey
my
my number of followers went down i don't
think i'd worry about any of that yet
because there's no evidence to suggest
that's anything but maintenance
yeah it's probably just getting rid of
bots probably uh
just maybe cleaning out some uh
you know dormant accounts that sort of
thing so i lost
just in case you want to know if it was
just you i think i lost
it's hard to know because i'm adding
people at the same time they're
subtracting people
but if i were to baseline it fewer than
a thousand
users maybe out of half a million
so well it wasn't a big percentage and
i think you would be better off if they
call the herd once in a while anyway
as long as they're doing it for the
right reasons so i wouldn't worry about
any of that
yet did all of you see the press
conference that the president did
yesterday
which was more like a monologue and a
lot less like a press conference
so of course most of the i think most of
the networks
probably didn't cover it because they
like the question part
where they can try to embarrass the
president they don't like the monologue
part
where he just talks about his
accomplishments but i gotta say
uh that was one of the strongest
press conferences that i've seen
and again i'm not sure if you want to
call it a press conference it was more
like a monologue
but the monologue part was
extraordinarily good
and it was extraordinarily good for a
number of reasons
one was his his tone and presentation
it was uh i would call it
serious and powerful
you know with sort of some joking at the
end which was extra good
but when he was talking about his
accomplishments
you know he would say stuff like you
know we we've done x and i'd say
wow that's pretty good you know that's
pretty good thing to
stick in there and then he'd say another
accomplishment and i think
that's two and those are both pretty
good
pretty strong and then there'd be
another one
and they were they all seemed to have a
flavor to them
of strength right when you talked about
the tennessee valley authority which
frankly most of us maybe none of us
really understand what the hell that is
but it's some kind of a quasi-public
private government situation i don't
know
i was too bored to look into it but when
the president said
you know we have some problems with
their leadership
i fired the chairman of the board i
thought to myself
that's pretty good that's pretty good
what would you love to see more
than the president firing somebody who
had it coming
according you know allegedly it's a real
strong move so i don't know if the
you know the details of the situation
but in terms of the press conference
leading off with a strong manager move
of this guy wasn't doing it right and so
i fired the chairman of the board and
i'm going to keep firing all the board
members because i guess that was the
power that the government has
i'm going to keep firing board members
until they change the situation
and then apparently he got what he
wanted
which was also strong because i think
the problem was they were firing
americans who were higher paid to
replace them with lower paid
employees from other countries and then
asking the americans who are being fired
to train their
lower cost replacements now if your
president
isn't willing to fire people over that
you need a new president because
if you're the jobs president and the you
know america first president
that is a really strong play
so just the optics of it and i would say
the
competence of it because it just looks
like oh shoot
that's exactly what you need you need
somebody who's going to fire those guys
until they stop this
and there's a list of other things i
forget the details but every one of them
was wrong and then he ended with a joke
at the end
i'll give i think this is maybe
maybe i don't know why if you would
agree
but maybe the strongest
public appearance he's ever made i i
don't think i've ever seen better than
that
you know i we like the rallies and the
fun and the controversial ones
but when he turns off the controversy
and
and at the press conference he just
turned off the controversy in my opinion
you know relative to any trump uh
situation but when he turns it off
and he just goes i'm doing the job for
you
it's really strong but we do like the
provocation
as well now here's the funniest thing he
did one of his executive orders
was is going to be he just announced it
but hasn't done it
an executive order to uh
require that pre-existing conditions
are covered by insurance now how did the
press cover that now you are aware
that the president is often accused of
being the guy who's going to
take that right away the right to be
covered even if you have pre-existing
conditions
is it wasn't that one of the biggest the
biggest
claims against this president is that
that he was the one
who would be behind taking away your
pre-existing
coverage rights and then the way that
the press covered it when he says i'll
do an executive order which is a really
public thing i mean basically
you would you would be roasted if you
made such a direct
executive order made a public deal about
not taking away
existing uh you know what i said the
coverage for existing conditions
and how did the news cover it
the news covered it as it was stupid
because that's already the law under
obama's
past work now do you feel like that's
the right context to cover this
to say that uh it's a it's an
unnecessary executive order
because it's already the law now here's
the beauty part
because it was wrong but it's that
little bit of wrong part
yes it is true that you don't need an
executive order for something that's
already the law of the land
so in that sense it's sort of wrong
which is what causes cnn to cover it and
then while they're covering it
they have guaranteed that their audience
hears this message
under a trump administration you're
really really
protected on your uh on your
earlier conditions so trump
managed to do something that didn't make
sense
an executive order for something that's
already the law of land
at least it doesn't make sense from a
cnn world view i actually think it makes
complete sense
but that little bit of wrongness made
them boost his signal
perfectly this could not have worked out
better for the president
if you are ever going to be criticized
let's hope it's this way
how about this you're running for
president and you say
not only am i in favor of peace but i'm
gonna
pass a resolution saying that i'm
peaceful
and then the news says you idiot
you don't need a resolution to say how
peaceful you are
because you're already being peaceful
well if the message you wanted for the
public is hey i'm the peaceful candidate
that's how you get there so i thought
that was a fairly
brilliant move by the president
to add an executive order that is
unnecessary but absolutely
persuasive because i don't think anybody
is going to walk away from that thinking
oh he's going to do an executive order
and then do exactly the opposite if he
gets reelected
it doesn't feel like that's even
slightly possible
this is clearly why he wants he wants
these conditions to be covered
that could not be any more clear
all right uh according to rasmussen
i said this before but it's blowing my
mind
30 36 of black
likely voters approve of the president's
job performance at the moment
36
if that number is anywhere close to true
the election's over now i think the
election's over
anyway i don't think biden actually has
any real chance
and anybody pretending he does at this
point
you have to sort of check yourself at
this point this
isn't a real election unless they
substitute somebody in
who might have a chance this is going to
be a stroll to re-election
this is not a sprint the president could
stop for a smoke break
and still get elected president the the
glide path for the president
is pretty clear at this point
just show up do the kind of work he did
at the
the press conference yesterday which was
outstanding
message wise and and tone wise and
everything else
and i think he's there
but here's a question we must ask
ourselves
why is there such a delay in the vice
president pick
now obviously some of the delay might be
because it's a weekend
and they would wait for something like a
tuesday or a monday to
control the weekly news cycle so it
could be just you know it takes a while
to get things done
could be took longer than they thought
possible
but i think all the smart people are
saying it looks like they might be
delaying because they've got a problem
knowing who should be at the top of the
ticket if you know what i mean
and you don't want to waste your best
candidate
in the second place if that's the one
you think should have been in the first
place
so you can see where they're jockeying
saying to themselves well
maybe it's not kamala harris for the vp
role
and by the way if biden announces it's
not
kabul harris i think you're going to
have to start seeing kamala harris as
maybe the replacement for the top spot
that might be a signal but could also be
a signal not
of course could go either way but i
would certainly my antenna
antennae would go up and say what
what why are you holding kamala harris
out
uh available for a job
if not the vice presidency
and why would uh why would black likely
voters
have such a high approval of trump 36
being at least historically high
and i have some hypotheses i've often
told you that one of the
keys to persuasion is
simplicity and another key is repetition
build the wall build the wall build the
wall if you hear it enough
and it's simple and it's unambiguous it
just
it just becomes part of you after a
while
there's nothing that you can hear that
much without
being forced to incorporate it into your
worldview and give it a priority that
maybe it didn't
deserve but think about this have you
seen how disciplined trump has been for
the past
several years when he talks about
unemployment
he always always leads
with what he did for the
african-american
employment rate now if you're
as president the the first thing that
comes out of your mouth
every time you talk about good
employment is what you've done for the
black community
the first few times you hear this what
do you think to yourself well
politician right politician pandering
right
that's a little pandering yeah of course
he's going to do a shout out to a group
that he wants to get some folks for
so that's why you hear the first few
times after you've heard it
50 times you start thinking oh i guess
that's just a pandering thing he's going
to do every time
after you hear a thousand times
it's just true right
so this the tr you've watched the
transformation from
a pantry kind of thing that any
president would say
to he has said it so many times
so consistently so disciplined
and in my opinion quite incredibly like
it doesn't look fake or artificial
in the least he has transformed that
impossible thought into
you believe it now right do you believe
that the president literally cares
that black lives matter in in the
context of unemployment
especially he cares he cares
and the thing that people seem to forget
is that the truth the presidency is
pretty transparent
and you can't do a good job for the
country
you can't do a good job for yourself
unless you've done a good job for the
country the only way this president
comes out ahead
is if he does the work that's the only
way
it's so transparent there's no scenario
in which trump is thinking to himself
i think i'll just ride this and milk it
and see if i can make some money in my
side job as
as the uh you know the trump guy i i
can't even imagine it
there's no way he would be so unaware of
his environment i guess that he would
not understand
that the one and only path he has
for the rest of his life his other
business interests
to do well the one and only path is to
do
a really good job for the public
short of that it just doesn't work you
know you can't just leave the job and
say well
you know don't you love me anyway even
though you don't like what i did that's
that's not a thing
he has to do a good job he has to
and he has to do it for you know black
americans for
you know for everybody um
so i think the fact that he always
highlights it
went from a pantry sounding thing to a
well he's got to mean it at this point i
mean that's
pretty disciplined to say it so often
the other thing that doesn't get enough
play is that if you're
a black voter or just a black citizen
do you want open borders no
do you want less choice in school that's
what the democrats are offering you
less choice in school if you're black do
you want that
no no you don't do you want
fewer cops while you live in your high
crime neighborhood in too many cases
no not most people
most people want some good policing they
just want it to be better of course we
all do
um so if you tell yourself that this
36 black approval at the rasmussen gets
as an outlier i would say to you
could be anything's possible
you could have a presidential candidate
bitten by a bat
that might be rabid maybe not anything's
possible
but i feel like let me put it a
different way
i never understood why it wasn't already
36
in my mind if you have you know any
appreciation for what
uh black voters want out of life
and again not treating them as a
monolith
i don't want to go all joe biden on you
but it is true
that uh while there are many diverse
voices
in every group uh you know
it is true that the black community
one would expect would see the same
benefits
that you and i see why would it be
different
and i think the whole cries of racism
are disappearing every day that biden
does another
what did trey gowdy call it he appeared
on the five
yesterday great appearance on the five
and uh
and he went through the list of what he
called joe biden's
racially curious comments which is just
the freaking best framing
for this because i don't think anybody
thinks joe biden is some kind of a
racist
but if you make enough quote racially
curious comments
then it starts sounding like a dog
whistle doesn't it
but because it's biden the people
who's who are on the left must be
thinking to themselves
okay there are a lot of racially curious
statements he's made
throughout time do they form this
pattern
because if this were a republican
it would be a pattern right
but because his biden is it a pattern
or is it a coincidence is it
confirmation bias is it just
one of those things but if it were a
republican oh that's
this would definitely be a dog whistle
situation
but now it's fighting i have to think
that every time biden makes another
racially curious comment
that it makes people say uh maybe it's
just the way people talk
right maybe it's just the way people
this age
talk and maybe trump is not
sending secret you know racist whistles
maybe he just talks in a way that's you
know less delicate or more offensive
and that's all there is to the story
because it might be
all right uh the babylon bee if you're
not following the babylon bee
which is like i guess i'd call it like
the onion except
with a conservative flavor
they are really good so if you like your
humor
on politics in particular do a follow on
the babylon bee but here's one of their
headlines
today so headline from the babylon being
a tweet
biden tells staffers to pick any black
person for a vp
since quote they all think the same
anyway
now if okay just for context
this is alleged to be what joe biden
thinks
that the black community thinks the same
so i'm not laughing at
the black community i'm laughing at joe
biden just to remove any
uh any doubt about what that means uh
kanye has
has published his platform and you could
go take a look at it it seems that his
platform
is highly uh bible compatible
so much so that with each thing in his
platform
he shows you the applicable bible verse
that supports it
uh some of the things he wants is prayer
in school
and one of his big planks is fixing the
school system
so it works for everybody now
uh i i'm not really into the
prayer in school debate
you know i'm not a believer and i don't
object to it
so you know work it out among yourselves
i feel like i could be on the sideline
on that one
because i don't need the prayer for
myself but i
but i understand his benefits so just
work it out among yourselves whatever
you do is fine with me
and but here's the part i like kanye's
platform is actually the best platform
i've ever seen for the black community
and i don't know if he'll ever get
credit for that but
which is the other platform that's
focusing on schools
as as like a key lever
you know kanye covers the other stuff he
even says
that he would treat america first so
kanye
actually says explicitly that he's going
to negotiate etc
and treat america first as the best
model to move forward
i i think you should read it so just
google it
or i think mike cernovich tweeted it if
you want to find it on his
uh twitter feed i think i retweeted him
and it's worth reading it's worth
reading if you have a few minutes read
kanye west's
thing uh now i don't know if you saw
tucker carlson's
um he did uh what do you what would you
call it a mo
i guess a monologue on kanye west
if you didn't see it it's some of
tucker's best work
like really really good work i'm just
talking about the writing
you know the writing of that piece in
which he went through
you know the the kanye situation he
talks about how
until kanye said he liked the president
he wasn't crazy
in other words the media treated him as
just creative and provocative
until he seemed like he was on the other
side and then
the headlines are that he's crazy now
kanye himself
cops do some you know mental challenges
so i don't think it's you know
inaccurate
to agree with the person who has a
self-assessment
but it was very interesting to see that
before it didn't matter
and now and now they're throwing them
under the bus
so i would say kanye has the best
emphasis
on schools so he understands priorities
best if you wanted somebody to champion
you
you should pick somebody who has their
priorities right
and if kanye had said black lives matter
is my
primary uh thing you should dismiss him
as somebody who doesn't know what's
important
but instead he talks about education
hits the
nail on the head of what's important and
bringing some kind of a spiritual
revival to the united states you could
argue would be a good thing
i know that those of you are atheists
bristle at this
but so long as it's not anti-atheist
and it's not it's not it's not even
slightly anti-atheist
i think you might be able to coexist
with that
the funniest thing in the news is that a
t-shirt outfit called
teespring t-e-e spring
uh banned anti-fog shirts
while they look into it now they're
acting as if they're gonna look into it
so
you know maybe it's not permanent but
anti-fog
got all uh anti-falling all
crazy about it because they said hey but
you have
t-shirts from this or that right-leaning
group or extremist group
or what else hey why not our shirts and
uh here would be my answer to that
i think antifa is the only one they
mentioned that's literally
a domestic terrorist group i
i think if you're teespring you can get
rid of a domestic terrorist group from
your
your shirts doesn't feel like a reach to
me
so i would like to suggest that if they
stick with this and they don't bend
to the pressure that's no doubt coming
to their way that you might consider
doing a little shopping at teespring
send a little money their way
i suggested that if they make a shirt
called we cancelled
antifa then it might sell a few copies
might sell a few now i would not wear a
a cancelled anti-fuzz shirt in public
because it'd be like wearing a magic
shirt maga hat you get your ass beat
but i might buy one i might buy it and
put it in the closet
just to support teespring if they stick
with this if they don't stick with it
well who cares
um as i tweeted this morning
i have i've developed this habit that
i'm not sure i'm proud of
every morning the first thing i do is i
get my coffee i sit down on my computer
and literally the first thing i do after
that is i look at the news
usually twitter and it's filled with the
video
from the night before the highlight
clips from the big game in portland
now i call it the big game because i
don't think it looks like politics
anymore
i don't think it looks like a social
movement even in the least
the whatever antifa is
is closer to some kind of a role-playing
costumed sport and it went to a new
level last night
maybe recently where apparently antifa
has developed their own shield
like a plywood shield like
like old-timey costume uh role players
would have if they were playing
nice you know knights of old and then
they've got the antifa
on there and that they've got their
little crew of shield people with their
plywood
pushing against police
and i turn it on and this is not even
slightly
not even slightly an exaggeration when i
watch the clips usually
you know in andy noclip for example
when i when i look at the clips
i look at them like i'm watching sport
highlight clips
and i'm watching the police beat up
antifa
and it looks exactly like watching a
football game
with tackles and you see the highlight
reel of
look at this spectacular tackle and i'm
watching the same sport
except it's police also wearing
protective gear
just like football also trying to
control territory
in space just like football
you got fouls just like football
you've got announcers you know with
loudspeakers
just like football you got play by play
you got highlight clips
it's a sport now if you tell me that's
not a sport
watching the two teams with strategy and
costumes and meeting at the same field
every night
if you tell me that's not a sport you're
gonna have to define
sport a little bit more clearly because
it's not politics
there's no politics in that it's not
crime exactly because if it were they
would all be arrested
instead of just you know the the bad
apples that are doing something
specifically
so if it's not exactly crime it's
certainly nothing like a
social protest you know in any way that
we can understand it
it's a sport and i'm not going to see it
any other way
now of course those of you who are jerks
just said to yourself scott how can you
treat this as a sport people are getting
killed
and the police are being injured why do
you call this a sport
scott how can you not take this
seriously
well you're just a jerk because i am
complicated enough
that i can hold in my mind that it is
a super tragedy and it really makes me
mad
when the police are injured in
particular especially with these lasers
i think the police should be able to
shoot to kill anybody who has a laser
even if they're just brandishing it even
if you don't see it being used
i think the police should be able to
shoot to kill now
you might disagree and it might be a
terrible strategy because it would make
the police look like a
police state it would not be good for
the country but it would be good for the
police
and i'm going to say that sometimes
sometimes the citizens need to support
the police
it's not just always the other way
around right you know you can't you
can't be sending your troops out there
in the form of the police
you can't be sending your troops out
there unsupported
and if you can't let them shoot a
protester who's got a
laser in their hand just as if it were a
handgun
if they can't shoot that guy they ought
to have the right
so the best i can do is to say if you
put me on a truck
on a jury i will i will say
shot a guy with a deadly weapon i don't
need to hear any more evidence
if you'd like to present the evidence
sure if you need to
but i'm not going to listen to it
because if police
shoot somebody with a one of those
lasers at a protest has to be out of
protest
i'm not even going to listen to the
evidence at all
innocent boom i'll go right to the
verdict in fact i'll stand up in the
jury box
and say not guilty and then they'll say
um sir
the trial hasn't started yet and i'll
say just try to save time
anybody here doesn't want to save some
time because there's no freaking way
i'm going to vote against a cop who
takes out
one of these kids with a laser uh blow
it take his head right off it's fine
with me
now it would be bad for your career bad
for your life might even be bad for the
country
but i'd still back you still back you if
it happens
all right um
and and i've often said that you know
one of the big complaints from
protesters which i think has
merit is that the police might treat
different ethnicities differently
apparently the death rate is not treated
differently
you know the number of people killed
doesn't seem to matter
based on your race but probably there's
some
maybe a little extra abuse not maybe
there's certainly extra abuse
in black communities obviously it's
because they're high crime neighborhoods
that's a big part of the story
but let's say you just thought that was
a problem and you want to reduce the gap
well one way would be to have less abuse
against black citizens that would be
ideal
as long as you know everything else
works out that's of course what you want
but the other way to reduce the gap
would be for the police in portland
to just beat the out of these
protesters with the lasers like once a
day
just to get the numbers up because the
higher we get with the police beating up
white antifa protesters with the lasers
yeah
they have to be doing something bad the
more of those we get the closer the gap
will be
so there may be two problems one is
too many black people getting beaten up
by the police say the protesters
i don't know one way or the other but
the other is not enough white people
getting beaten up so we could close the
gap from both sides if we work at it
so let's get some more white people
getting beaten up by the police
if they're anti-fog people with lasers
that would be fine for me
all right i asked on
twitter a little unscientific poll i
said
would you hire a job candidate whose
social media supported
antifa ninety-four percent of you said
no
that you would not consider a job
candidate who had
pro-antifa stuff on their website
now if i were to ask the same question
of
people on the left because most of my
followers would be
trump supporters i would imagine and but
if you ask the same question on the left
you know would you hire a trump
supporter
you'd probably get the same answer you
you get a pretty good answer
so we've we've come to the point where
your politics plus your social media
make you unhirable by half of the public
but here's what i was
thinking all i would take is one major
company
with some serious gonads to announce in
public
just sort of preemptively i'm just
brainstorming here
but preemptively announced in public
that they would not consider hiring
anybody who was associated with antifa
can you imagine it
imagine a fortune 500 company where
their leadership has enough balls to say
the obvious
which is we just have to tell you it's
hard enough getting employees
and if you're supporting antifa you
can't be on our list
because we just can't support that what
would that do
just one just one fortune 500 company
make an announcement
we're just putting it out there if you
support antifa
we're never going to hire you it's it's
it's
absolutely off the table now the first
thing that would happen
is it would make it safe for other
companies but the other the other thing
that's even bigger
is that the parents of antifa which you
know
are supporting them right you know the
parents are sort of on board a little
bit
even if it's only by lack of action it's
going to activate the parents
because the parents are going to say uh
did i just find out that my child can
never be gainfully employed by
a big company where where the pay is
good and the benefits are good and
therefore
he will never lose leave my basement i
think he could move the needle
it would just take one big company
to make that statement and suddenly
parents everywhere would say
um hello uh jennifer
we'd really like you to have a job
someday so
maybe you should rethink this whole
thing could make a difference
all right here is
the update on the remember peter navarro
name check me on cnn and told cnn they
should watch my video
on the risk management part of the
decision about hydroxychloroquine
obviously i don't make medical
recommendations
but i can break down the argument based
on what the experts are
telling we naive citizens and based on
the information we have
which is you know less than what the
experts have what do you do
so that that's what i did the
decision-making part
not the medical part i just i just
listened to the medical part
and so navarro points to that
cnn mocks me the daily beast
mocks me the hill mocks me but nobody
that i've seen if you you can tell me if
there's any
any uh difference there nobody
that i've seen has criticized the video
and what i said in it nobody
as far as i can tell nobody do you know
how infrequent it is
for me to put out something that visible
and have nobody criticize it
no matter what it is it could be a comic
could be a book anything
you always get low reviews on something
there's always
somebody who's going to say this is no
good
right but not this and i don't know if
it's because
i i don't know if it's because of
nobody looked at it because it wasn't
linked in some of the articles
or if everybody agrees or maybe i just
didn't see any criticism
it's possible to so another day goes by
where that just sits there
as the truth and the truth is the least
important thing in the world so nobody
cares
let me correct for many of you a big
misconception
that you have and i'm watching some
people on
uh twitter who are making this analytic
mistake
it's based on a lack of knowledge about
something in particular
so i'm going to fill in a knowledge gap
for many of you
so many people would say do not take a
medicine
unless it has gone through the gold
standard
type of uh you know double-blind placebo
test
in fact i had a conversation with my
most
trump-hating democrat friend
last night by text in which um
he he said with no uncertain terms
no doctor ever should recommend
a a medicine that has not gone through
the highest
standard of tests now my friend
is really well read uh highly educated
more educated than i
uh and very very deeply
involved in reading the news and
following the news so this is a really
smart
really well informed person who used his
smartness and well-informed
status to tell me that is crazy for
a trump a peter navarro or even a doctor
to recommend using can you believe it
the horror a drug
that has not gone through the clinical
testing for the purpose it was
it was prescribed to which i said
have you heard of off-label off-label
prescriptions
he said he hadn't in a private prior
conversation he said he hadn't
had never heard of it and and then last
night i said
do you know that twenty percent of all
prescriptions are off label
which means that twenty percent of all
the prescriptions
one in five in this country have not
gone through that standard
that my friend and a lot of people on
twitter say is the only way you should
ever
uh prescribe something because their
blind spot is
that if a drug has been proven safe for
anything and the cost is reasonable
that your doctor working with you can
make a risk management decision that
goes like this
i've got this drug that was on that was
only gold standard tested for another
thing
but we did find out the side effects are
nothing to worry about
so given that the side effects are
trivially
dangerous you know barely enough that
it's not even worth mentioning
and it might work and there's some
reports that it works but they're not
the gold standard
let's give it a try and how often does
that happen well it turns out that some
of your
most popular drugs that are commonly
prescribed
did not go through any gold standard
testing except for other purposes
so hydroxychloroquine has been tested in
the past
for its own use you know lupus etc i
assume i think that's true
and uh if anybody claiming that it
should not be prescribed
because it has not passed the gold
standard
test which is true it has not but it's
also because they haven't tested it
in the right application so
[Applause]
if you see anybody saying that it hasn't
gone through the rigorous trials
they are ignorant of how medicine works
and you can fill them in with that 20
percent
over-the-counter prescriptions that did
not go through that process
and it is so safe so routine
so rational that 20 of prescriptions are
in that category
if you i mean ask yourself if this
were a problem would 20 of prescriptions
be in this category
no no
all right how about this
um so
do you have this problem where you want
to make a joke about bad things that are
happening
but you don't know where the line is
because you don't want to be canceled
because you don't want to be that person
but sometimes it's so funny you can't
help it
well when i heard about as you know
the libertarian party candidate
being bitten by a possibly rabid
bat i looked at the comments
and i saw that matt schwartz asked how's
the bat
now i didn't feel proud that i laughed
at that
how's the bat and i felt even less proud
when i responded to it with
the answer to how's the bat i said ahead
in the polling
i don't feel good about it but if you
laughed at it
well maybe that's something
big news of course is so we've got some
big fake news about
russia china and iran and
the thought is that they're all trying
to influence the election
and but the problematic one seems to be
russia
because according to the fake news the
russians are trying to support
president trump president trump's
response to that is
he's the been the toughest on russia he
gives a number of examples
that's not really the answer to whether
russia is trying to help you because it
could be true
that the president is their toughest
toughest sanctions toughest opponent
toughest president on them
that could be true and there's a really
good argument
for it it could be true at the same time
they prefer him because remember russia
has two bad choices
they they either keep the the the devil
they know
which is trump at least they can talk to
him at least they can deal with him
even though he's you know being a pain
in the ass to putin
at least they can deal with him he's
predictable you know where he stands
you know he'll make a deal compared to
biden
because biden would just go after him
because apparently that's
you know that's their technique in favor
of china
biden would be pro-china no doubt
russia's biggest risk
and uh so it could be true
that russia wants trump at the same time
is true
that trump doesn't want that and is
sanctioning the hell out of them for
whatever the hell they're doing
um but here's my prediction you will
never see
a compelling example of this alleged
russian
interference because if you did you
would see that it's
trivial the same way if you had seen and
almost nobody did
the memes that the so-called russian
troll farm
put out in 2016 those memes
looked like a sixth grade project that
was
underfunded they didn't even look like
adults had made them
they were that bad they certainly had no
impact i definitely never saw them until
it all came out and i got to see a bunch
of them all at once
and they weren't even in the same
direction some of them were anti-hillary
some of them were anti-trump i mean it
was
you could argue that the troll farm was
trying to influence the election
because they made you know u.s campaign
topic memes but you can't argue it
mattered not when you see them i mean if
you've never seen them you could say
well yeah it seems entirely possible
that a sophisticated kgb
operation with the top minds in the
world and
great hackers could come up with memes
that are just so powerful
so good they can influence our election
yeah i mean in
in in the abstract that seems like
totally a thing
and then you see what they actually
produced and you say
oh this is a little sad and maybe it's
not
putin ordering this maybe it's somebody
who thought they could
please putin by doing it on their own
which is what it looked like
and it's common apparently it's common
for everybody to jockey for favor with
putin
by just trying to do something that they
think he would like and then hey
look what i did so don't expect you will
ever see
some examples of russian interference
and if you do it's going to be so
trivial that you're going to say
uh this is what you're talking about
so that's my that's my prediction
um about uh iran
um we may be seeing some more explody
stuff
uh as jake novak had
pointed out even months ago there seems
to be
at least a suggestion that
either israel or the united states or
both
have some extra knowledge about where
iran is keeping their bad stuff
you know their bomb making stuff their
weapons etc
so somehow we know more than we used to
know and it looks like
maybe where we or israel is acting upon
it
so that's an interesting story um
all right i think that uh i've covered
everything i'd like to cover
oh there's sturgis motorcycle rally well
that's a funny story
yeah sturgis you know all the motor the
bikers come to
sturgis at the same time and have a big
event
and uh there's some fun talk that
anti-fog could show up but
antifa is not going to show up there i
would not expect the anti-fun to show up
in sturgis but that's a funny thought
all right that's all for now come on man
i'll talk to you later
