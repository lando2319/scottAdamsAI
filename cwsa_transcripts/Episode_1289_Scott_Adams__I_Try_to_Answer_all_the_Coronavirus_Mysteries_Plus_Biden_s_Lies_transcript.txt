hey everybody come on in here
it's about time

coffee with scott adams
best part of the day
every single time
and

matthew forgot his coffee everybody hold
on
matthew we're waiting for you
okay all right i think matthew has his
coffee
the rest of you do you have your
cupboard burger glass a tanker challenge
just time to canteen show your flask of
vessel of any kind if you do fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing that got
everybody going
it's the best part of the day it's
called the simultaneous sip and it's
going to happen
wait wait somebody's not ready
john
john you ready
okay now go
all right i think we got everybody there
so
my favorite story of the day
says way too much about me
i was thinking about
not mentioning this one
but i figure i'll just be transparent
about this
i don't know what this says about me
that this is my favorite story
there was a an elderly couple man man in
his 80s and his wife
at home and there was a home in vader
home invader comes in with a knife
threatening to kill the wife
the 82 year old vietnam veteran takes
his shotgun
that was i guess
displayed on the wall
takes it off the wall and beats the guy
to death with it
i'm not proud of the fact that that's my
favorite story
but
i have a soft spot
because there are a lot of these stories
it's usually a veteran
have you noticed that it's often a
veteran
so i guess whatever that military
training is
that's good stuff
it doesn't wear off no matter how no
matter how long you've not been in the
military
apparently you're still willing to take
the gun off the wall and beat somebody
to death
now i'm extra ashamed of the following
thing
that after he had subdued the guy
he finished him off
now
once you're over 80 i think you can do
that
i don't know if if somebody if somebody
say 35
had subdued a an invader in their home
and then once the person's on the ground
they they beat them until they were
actually dead
with a blunt object
wouldn't there be some kind of charges
because once you've stopped them
i don't know if you're allowed to finish
them off
but if you're over 80
and
you're a military veteran
thank you for your service
and by the way he was protecting his
wife
and let me let me put forth a a new rule
just in case the legal system
doesn't cover every situation
once you've subdued somebody and they're
unconscious
in your own home
it's probably illegal to kill them
you know once they're no longer an
obvious threat
but this
but i would like to uh propose an
exception to that rule
if that guy was trying to kill your wife
if that guy was trying to kill your wife
or any family member
you can finish him off
you can finish the job
because
let me tell you something
if anybody ever tries to kill my wife
and i get them down
they're not going to get a second chance
i'm not going to let them ever get up
again
because you only get one chance to try
to kill my wife
that's not like uh why don't you circle
back situation yeah we're good for now
but maybe later yeah you could take
another try at it
no no if somebody tries to kill your
wife
it should just be legal to finish him
off
now i don't think that's the way the law
works but it should
all right let's talk about something
else
the aap reports that the u.s life
expectancy has dropped by a year
because of the pandemic
number one do you believe that we can
calculate
life expectancy that well
maybe we can
but i don't know if a year is something
we can necessarily
pick out of the noise
but if it's true let's say we can
measure that maybe we can it's possible
maybe we can
do you believe that the life expectancy
dropped by a year
what if it did
suppose it did drop by a year would that
uh would that convince you that this
wasn't just a bad cold
yeah
a lot of people doubting it yeah i i
feel like
i feel as if
the only uh
rational opinion to have about any data
is that maybe not
maybe the data's wrong
because how often have we seen accurate
data in the last year
never how about never
have we seen any accurate data
on anything
because everything that we've seen has
been revised
do you think they're done revising
i don't think so
we haven't seen any any accurate data in
a year
but then we get this new one and we're
like well here's some data i guess this
is accurate
looks like it's got a source
so
if we've learned that nothing from the
pandemic
the one thing we should take away is
that you can't trust
any of your data
any of it
now you still have to make decisions
so what the hell are you going to do
you don't trust any of your data but you
have to make decisions
anyway you don't you don't get a
pass and even doing nothing is a
decision so what the hell are you going
to do
so you're going to have to take some
guesses about what to believe if i had
to rank the things that are likely to be
true
i would say that measuring the life
expectancy
probably one of the things we can do a
little bit better than other things
probably i would imagine that the
system for reporting actual deaths no
matter the cause
is probably pretty advanced i would
think
now we don't know the cause exactly i
mean there could have been some mixture
of causes for this
but keep an eye on that all right here's
the biggest question of the day
why the hell
are coronavirus deaths and infections
and hospitalizations
plummeting
all over the world at the same time
is the reason that they're plummeting at
the same time all over the world
seasonality
because it's different seasons
all over the world
it's not the same season
and
if um
as happened to me this morning
when i said hey it's plummeting
people said to me and i i would like to
give a good impression
of the average person who responded to
me
duh scott
everybody knows a virus is seasonal
it's seasonal
and so when you see it acting
seasonally
why are you surprised that a virus which
is always
seasonal
is acting
seasonally
scott why don't you understand that
to which i say
i was not under the impression
that a virus
even uses a calendar
how does the virus know
how does it know what season it is
right
if the virus doesn't know what season it
is
how can it go away
oh i know what you're saying
seasonality is really just a shorthand
for the uh the obvious stuff right
there's more sunshine there's more
vitamin d
when it's warmer the virus maybe doesn't
do the same stuff
um you know plus you're indoors more
so it's all of that stuff
right you're indoors more don't get the
sun
the heat doesn't kill the virus when
it's on surfaces right
all debunked it's all been debunked
each component
of seasonality
has been debunked
in other words they've studied humidity
doesn't seem to be the answer it's not
the heat exactly
because let me ask you this how much
time do you spend outdoors in let's say
palm springs
or well actually they probably golf a
lot in the winter
but you would notice
all of it if any of those sub
things within seasonality if any one of
them actually made a difference we would
know that by now all right because you
could just look at different places
take a place that's really hot
and it's so hot that they don't go
outside in the winter on in the summer i
mean
so they don't go outside in the summer
because it's too hot
do they have a plunge in
viruses
because it's summer or do they have an
increase in infections
because they're indoors because it's so
hot they have to stay indoors
we don't see that so we're not seeing a
correlation with staying indoors
because people do it in hot places we
don't see scientifically that it's the
heat
or the humidity they test that in lab
labs etc and they don't doesn't seem to
make a difference
so every component
of seasonality
including and i'm uh
i hate to say this but i think vitamin d
has been debunked
now i'm not going to say that for sure
but i think it has
and here's why
because i believe that every time you
see a study about vitamin d it's it's at
least as likely to be backwards
correlation
meaning that people who have low vitamin
d have the worst outcomes
but people who are unhealthy in general
probably have low vitamin d
so it might be telling you nothing
except that
people who are generally unhealthy are
more likely to die
number two
we know that when people get the vitamin
d
concentrate or the activated vitamin d
whatever it is in the hospitals
that some studies are saying that it
makes a difference
so therefore you say well wait a minute
if it makes people better in the
hospital
uh duh it must
it must be good to take your vitamin d
pills and get some sun
but apparently
the
um
the type of vitamin d that you get in a
hospital is an activated type you can't
buy a pill over the counter that gives
you that and you probably can't get
sunshine
that would be equal to what you're
getting in the hospital with a
with that activated vitamin d
so i don't think vitamin d is the answer
although i i'm fairly confident that
it's you know some part of
some part of the equation but i don't
think it's the big thing
that doesn't it doesn't seem to be that
correlated or correlated enough with the
big peaks and valleys
then i saw
somebody said it's really about holiday
get-togethers
because if you look at the united states
our peaks are perfectly
correlated with um halloween
thanksgiving and then christmas
and you look at the graph and you go oh
it's pretty convincing and then the
skeptic comes in five seconds later and
says you're forgetting the regional
effects if you look at the country's
average
it does look correlated with those three
events but if you look at regions
there are regions that didn't have that
effect how could that be
it was only the average that looked like
it but how in the world
could there be a region in the united
states that didn't have a christmas
effect
is there some region in the united
states where they don't celebrate
christmas the same way
i don't think so
it's pretty pretty uniform across the
country i think
so
almost everything that you can come down
to doesn't matter
what about leadership
about leadership
we've got countries doing all kinds of
different things
in
you know from sweden to india to china
to the united states all kinds of
different leadership things
and they're all having similar peaks and
valleys
no matter what the leaders are doing
how do you explain that
does that tell you that masks don't work
it doesn't tell you that
it definitely doesn't tell you that
masks don't work it just tells you we
can't we can't
suss out how much it works
and explain the whole curves that way
because the beginning of those big peaks
and valleys that we see i don't think
the mask wearing was much different in
the beginning of the top or the or the
end
i haven't seen that much difference in
math squaring where i am anyway but the
peaks and the valleys are still
happening
so while i do believe that masks work
somewhat
it definitely doesn't explain the big
differences so then i saw a tweet uh
this morning
from a very well-informed uh gentleman
vincent
raj kumar he's a professor at the mayo
clinic
and he's oncologist and blah blah so
he's got a lot of qualifications
and he was saying that in india there's
you know just like everywhere in the
world it seems there's a big drop in
infections and
deaths
so it's not just that the infections
have gone down this is an important
point
if you think that the reason the
infections have gone down is something
about testing
you know biden's in office so we're
testing less or whatever keep in mind
it's the same things happening all
around the world
and biden didn't get elected anywhere
else
right so it's not a biden effect
nor is it how much they're testing
because the correlations happens no
matter what the countries are doing and
the testing wouldn't have anything to do
with how many deaths and icu
residents there were so we're seeing
still a big mystery
and what vincent raj kumar adds to this
is that in india at least they had a
gigantic spike and now a gigantic
decline
apparently the uh zero
prevalence
in
a few cities chennai is one chennai if
i'm pronouncing that right
was a 40 in november which means it
could easily be over 50 percent
by now
and i think there was at least one other
city in
india in which they did the study and
found close to half of the people had
uh signs of the infection
without necessarily having had any
symptoms
half
now
if you say
if you say to me well that explains
india
india got some kind of herd immunity
but it doesn't explain other countries
because other countries did more of a
lockdown
and i don't think their cereal
prevalence would be anywhere near 50 it
could be close to 20
but i don't think it's anywhere near 50.
and yet the similar outcomes
so again
what the hell is going on
now some of it might be that we're
getting smarter about treating people
when they have symptoms so that might be
part of the icu and death rate
falling could be
um
but i know you're gonna say it's
hydroxychloroquine but the uh the total
amount of hydroxychloroquine pills
that were
available in india i saw 100 million
now i don't know how many pills one
person takes
but i don't think 100 million pills
would explain what's happening there
because again same experience in other
countries doing completely different
things
so even if hydroxycolic chloroquine
works
uh according to the studies by the way i
did read
a long paper saying that all of the
studies on hydroxychloroquine say they
work
now i can't say that's true i forget if
i tweeted that
but it was very credible
and this is a problem when people like
me look at scientific explanations or
statistical explanations i'm out of my
field
so i'm judging based on how it's written
and whether the person has
qualifications and you know i'm judging
in all these indirect ways
but the argument was this
that a hundred percent of all the
studies have shown hydroxychloroquine
works
now
you probably say
that's not right scott it was only the
observational ones where you sort of
look backwards
that seemed to say it works the zelenko
the
uh renault ddo whatever they were not
randomized controlled tests in the
randomized and controlled tests
it consistently did not show an effect
is that what you've heard
would you say
that this is true
as a general statement all the ones
where you look backwards and it's not
the perfect way to judge science but we
use it if we can if it's the only thing
we have
and those
seem to universally indicate that
hydroxychloroquine probably works
but all the ones where they did a really
good randomized controlled study the
really good gold standard it didn't work
that's what you've been told right
is that your current understanding
so this paper i read and i wish i could
refer to it made the following point
which i'm not going to tell you is true
i'll just
pass it along
the randomized controlled
trials
either focused in the wrong place
meaning looking at people who already
were sick which is not the whole point
of hydroxychloroquine
you don't give it to people after
they're really sick
so some of the randomized control tests
were just irrelevant they're they're not
even studying the right thing so throw
those away
that still leaves some randomized
controlled studies that showed no effect
but there might be another reason that
doesn't show effect
it could be the number of people in the
study
and if you take the number of people in
the study
whether the hydroxychloroquine worked or
did not work
it wouldn't show up
right so the number of people in the
study was not sufficient that you could
have actually proven anything
that it worked or that it didn't work
and sure enough they did not show that
it worked
but they also didn't show it didn't work
because they didn't have enough
enough study people
all they did is show that they couldn't
show that it worked
and how does the news
present that the news says it doesn't
work
but that's not what those tests showed
according to this person who seemed
smart that i was reading
and what they did was they took the
randomized control test that did study
at least something close to what you
were supposed to be studying
and they added them together
i'm speaking
loosely not in statistically technical
ways if you take the the various
randomized controlled tests you add them
together until they do have statistical
meaning
the benefit of the hydroxyl chloroquine
is really clear
like it's a big benefit
so according to this one author
the current situation is a hundred
percent
of every
hydroxychloroquine test or observational
trial
that asks the right question
about taking it early not about taking
it too late but about taking it early
that all of them
show a big
a big improvement
but only if you take the randomized
controlled ones and add them together so
they have enough statistical weight now
can you add different things together
it's not a perfect way to do it you know
sort of sort of looking at the macro
picture and doing a statistics on the
statistics i guess you could say
now
i do not promote
that point of view which i'm describing
which is somebody else's point of view
and somebody who looked into it i'm just
telling you that there is an argument
out there that every
every look at hydroxychloroquine
showed it worked
so there's a point of view out there
that says that it is not my point of
view so i don't get kicked off of social
media
got that
not my point of view
just tell you somebody else's point of
view all right
so here's the thing i don't think
there's enough hydroxychloroquine that
was prescribed in india i don't think
100 million
tablets would
explain what's going on there
and the other problem is apparently if
you don't get the hydroxyl chloroquine
pretty close to the first day you get
the infection
it's its ability to help you decreases
rapidly the longer you wait
how many people
take hydroxychloroquine the day that
they get the infection
zero
maybe zero
i wouldn't take any hydroxychloroquine
or anything else
until i had something that looked like
a symptom
and that's going to be days later right
so i don't know that even if
hydroxychloroquine works
i don't know they could practically work
because you don't know the day you got
it so the only way you could do it is
everybody take it all the time i suppose
but nobody's going to take it on the day
they got the virus because they don't
know they have the virus they're going
to wait a few days so i'm just not even
sure it would make that much difference
even if it works
the way it's being prescribed anyway
um
so what do you think of uh
oh i'm sorry the the cerro prevalence
was um
somewhat
i think i may be mixing my topics a
little bit so part of the theory about
india is that they would have cross
immunity
from prior coronavirus infections
now
i thought that had been debunked
but i don't have a source for that
last june or so
people were talking about this cross
immunity thing
but are they still talking about that
because i feel like i saw something that
debunked it recently but i don't have a
source so i'm not going to say that's
true
we'll talk about simone sanders in a
minute somebody's asking about that all
right so here is my best guess on what
it is that's driving infections all over
the world and i'll just put this out
here because i don't have a better
infection i think the biggest factor is
the degree of strange you let into your
house
now i'm using strange the way the
old-timers use strange to
refer to it having uh sexual relations
with somebody who's not your regular
that would be your you're strange so an
old-timey old-timey kind of saying
it seems to me that the thing about
holidays is not so much the weather
because the weather is different all
over the world during holidays but
rather uh it's the one time people
aren't going to wear masks and they'll
be in close contact with people from
other places i think when your family
comes in town you don't wear a mask do
you
does anybody wear a mask if their cousin
comes into town for christmas
and your cousin is staying at your house
are you wearing a mask in your house
because your cousin came
and your cousin's from another state
right
oh somebody said yes
somebody actually said yes but mo all
the comments coming through are no no no
hell no so i think that you have this
problem the number of people who cross
the transom into your house
who are not your regulars
is probably
eighty percent of the story
that's my guess
my guess is that eighty percent
of the infections are because
you let somebody in your house
who is not among your regular people you
let in the house and that of course goes
wild around you know
holidays and that's probably the whole
thing
do i nope nope
uh i do not
so if my
uh
adult stepdaughter visits me in my house
as she did recently
so she's socially distancing in another
place uh typically so i don't run into
her you know too many times even though
we love we live locally
but when my own stepdaughter comes in my
house
no i don't i don't wear a mask
but if anybody else comes in when the
plumber comes in you know et cetera i
mask up the whole time so anybody else
who comes in my house i'm going to mask
but my step daughter
can't do it
i just can't do it
i mean i know i should
but i can't now i also you know keep a
little distance and stuff but i don't
really try too hard
right and i think that
that's just a universal truth you just
don't mask
your own family members inside your
private home and part of it is because
we're dumb
right we're dumb
and we think well
my cousin looks healthy
so i guess there's no coronavirus
because it looks healthy to me and then
your cousin starts coughing
and then you go to the next level of
denial you go well
cousin's a smoker
probably a smoker
it's fine no coronavirus there so we can
very easily talk ourselves then of
taking precautions all right
brian stelter uh humorously was arguing
i guess yesterday that the news is not
boring without trump no the news is not
boring in fact look at all the things
that happened in january
and he said look at all the stuff i mean
january was full of news
mostly about trump
[Laughter]
what news was
what news was brian stelter watching for
the month of january the only news i saw
was about trump
what trump did on the pandemic
compared to biden what trump did you
know
the capital assault
trump's impeachment what trump is saying
yeah january was full of news brian
stelter about trump
so good luck when he's
i don't know if he'll ever be out of the
news
so now that uh trump has at least he's
off twitter and he's maybe stepped back
a little bit we don't know for a while
and rush limbaugh has passed
who exactly is the voice of
conservatives now
who would
there's there's a giant void there isn't
there who would you say
is the voice
of conservatives
i'm seeing uh tucker carlson rand paul
ben shapiro
ted cruz crowder
um
glenn beck
so those are the names mark stein i'm
just reading some names going by
but
how which one of those
would carry the weight of a trump or a
russian limbaugh
which one of those has that kind of
effect
because
um some of them have big audiences yeah
don
bongino dan
bongino uh hannity
i don't know
don't know i feel as if
there's a void and that the ones the
ones you name are obviously the the ones
who
uh candace owens okay
mark levin
yeah you know there but
all of the people you that i've
mentioned have you noticed that they all
seem to be in the same sort of zone
right
there's nobody that we've listed who is
just like obviously a level above
the others in the list they're all good
names they're just it's not obvious
who's going to be the
you know who emerges from that
so watching cnn turn on the democrats is
and biden's administration is fun
i was watching john berman pressing
simone sanders on the
whether teachers should get vaccinated
you have to watch that interview
it's going around the internet
but to watch simone sanders avoid the
question it was a simple question and
and berman to his credit was was
pressing hard and he was saying uh i
like this he goes it's not a trick
question i feel like you guys have
treated like a trick question is it safe
for teachers to go back to school
and then she answers something about we
think teachers should be prioritized for
vaccinations and then john berman says
okay okay that's not quite the answer to
the question
the question is
with or without vaccinations or are you
saying that they must be vaccinated
before they go back what is your view
is it safe for teachers to go back
well let me tell you what the joe biden
administration says about vaccinations
and like vermin is like
no
that's not the question
it's a yes or no
and she wouldn't answer
the biggest
question in the country
the biggest question about kids going
back to school
and
biden's spokesperson
wouldn't directly answer it
are you kidding me
that's a question you have to directly
answer let me ask you this
do you think trump would not be able to
answer that freaking question
yeah he could do you think uh kaylee mc
mcinney couldn't answer that question of
course she could
it's not a hard question it's a yes or
no question now you can say yes or no
and then add some detail
but it's still a yes or no question
and
that was shockingly incompetent
both as
communication but also as policy
is the biggest question and they can't
even tell us if they have an opinion
that's like not even being there
it's like it's like taking the time off
or something
i guess
there's reports that biden's approval
rate is plummeting
because of the school openings
lack of
of clarity
now remember all the words that were
used about the trump administration it
was chaos and incompetence
chaos and incompetence
but when
this happens with the biden
administration which sure looks like
incompetence to me i don't know how else
you could
how else could you frame it it just
looks like incompetence
because it
and i'm not even
i'm not even arguing against the policy
i'm saying if you can't even tell us
your opinion of the policy
that's incompetence you know independent
of whether the policy is good or bad
all right um
adam kinzinger
so he's republican and he's uh he was
one of the ones who voted to impeach
trump
and he started a group called country
first
so he doesn't like what trump was up to
so instead of america first
they've come up with this great
this great slogan country first
i'll tell you
if you wanted to get away from the whole
america first
vibe
you would run to country first
wait a minute
those sound very similar don't they
right the guy who's the anti-trump can't
even come up with a slogan that
doesn't sound exactly like trump now
remember what i've been telling you
forever
that the longer trump is out of office
the better he will look
because the the opposition to him was
reflexive
once he's gone and you get to actually
look at the topic and you know and
actually independently think what makes
sense
a lot of things he got criticized for
are going to sound kind of
sensible
and while adam kinziger's country first
idea is not the same as america first
if you can't even get the slogan part
right
i don't even need to listen to the rest
of it right because it feels like
getting the slogan right
or at least not making it the same
sounding as america first the thing
you're against
or you know the person you're against i
guess the policies
uh
i don't know
not a good start but country first in
their context means uh don't be not
being political about
uh political decisions but rather making
decisions that are good for the country
but uh
democrats don't make decisions that are
good for the country do they don't they
make decisions that are good for the
world
not just the country
i think that's a philosophical
difference
and
anyway
um
so daniel dale who was hired to do
fact-checking during the trump
administration i guess he hasn't been
fired yet so
in order to preserve his job
and to not make it look as if he was
just a hatchet man against trump he
remains on the job but now he's doing
fact checking about biden
now if biden
gave a town hall in which he made four
false claims
what would be the word or words you
would use to describe
someone who made
several statements which were not true
if it's trump
would you say he's lying
you would right liar liar but no if it's
biden you say he made
at least four and i quote
false statistical claims
that's right
they were just
just statistical claims
i mean
anybody can make a mistake
on like a a statistical claim
i mean that and that doesn't even count
right how are we even
why are we even talking about it
it's not like it was a lie
it's not like he's incompetent i mean
those would be big problems
no no no we're talking about
like some statistical
you know you know just that we don't
need to talk about it it's just
statistical stuff
well what were they
one he said
biden said if we kept the
the minimum wage of 725
and then just uh
if we had indexed it for inflation
that it would already be 20 bucks an
hour by now
so inflation would have just already
pushed it to 20 bucks so what's the big
deal about 15 bucks
as a minimum wage when it would have
been 20 bucks if you just let inflation
take it from 7.25
except that
nothing like that is true
do you know what the inflation would
have been
not 20 bucks
it would have gone from 7 25
an hour to
uh
a little over eight dollars
so he wasn't he wasn't even in the
general vicinity of the right answer now
that's just a statistical claim right
it's kind of a big one
because the difference between
doubling the uh
doubling
the minimum wage versus
not even raising it
is pretty big
that's not a little statistical problem
it changes your entire impression of the
topic
because if you told me it was true
that the old minimum wage would equate
to 20 if we hadn't changed anything i
would actually find that kind of
persuasive
i would say really well if it wasn't a
problem before
and it's basically the same number now
why would it be a problem now
but in fact it's not true and so it
changes your whole opinion of what this
conversation is about that's not a false
statistical claim
that's a real big problem
for a real big topic
what else do you have
uh let's see
he claimed that the majority of
undocumented immigrants are not hispanic
a majority of non-documented immigrants
to this country are not hispanic he said
what's the real number
approximately 77 percent
77
are estimated it's hard to count exactly
are from latin america and mexico
and and he didn't even know that the
majority
are hispanic
he's in charge of that
he's in charge of that
didn't know even the basics
of where they're coming from
small statistical problem
you ignore it that's a little
yeah a little statistical thing
i'd say that's a pretty big difference
um
he was talking about let's see he also
talked about china's demographic
challenge
because he said uh
they're gonna end
biden said when he came back from china
one time talking to them they're gonna
end their one child policy
and they won't let in the immigrants and
that's going to be a problem
because more people are retiring than
working in china
so he says how can they sustain economic
growth when there are more people
retiring
than there are working
and the fact check is
that's not even close to true
that's that's not even in the same
universe
as anything that's slightly true
no there are a lot more people being
born in china than are retiring it's not
even close
so
uh those are just three little
statistical things he got wrong
all right uh
i am watching with amusement as cnn
tries to handle the governor cuomo
situation with the nursing home deaths
and then the covering up of the data etc
allegedly and
now there's a new story that governor
cuomo
uh threatened another uh politician a
democratic assemblyman so this is
somebody on his own in his own party and
in a phone call he he
threatened to destroy him
now apparently these democrats are big
on destroying people i'll destroy you
now remember when i told you when the uh
whoever the communications guy
and biden's staff he ended up quitting
because he had threatened that he would
destroy somebody
and i told you at the time
it's actually kind of common political
talk
you know in private conversations i'll
bet it's fairly common for a politician
to or anybody in that business
to threaten to destroy somebody i just
don't think it's that unusual
and sure enough cuomo threatened to
destroy
assemblyman ron kim now i would just
like to point out that a hundred percent
of the people
that cuomo has threatened to destroy are
asian americans
a hundred percent
there's only one of them
that we know of
but you know if this had been republican
i feel like they would have pointed that
down
but here's the fun part so jake tapper
to his credit is going hard at this
story and pulling no punches at least
what i saw
how does jake tapper
interact with
his his colleague chris cuomo who works
at the network
when jake tapper's going hard
at his brother
like is that an awkward situation
how do those meetings go
it feels like that would just be really
awkward
but
credit to cnn for not
didn't look like they were pulling any
punches at least what i saw
um
let's see
that is about what i wanted to talk
about today except that china is
china is claiming that
maybe the
virus covet virus came in of an american
lab
so that's what china is claiming that
the virus might have come from an
american lab
okay
and they took the american lab virus and
we took it to wuhan and
released it near their
i mean i don't know what's that theory
so um while i am not i'm not convinced
that the wuhan
uh
lab is where the virus came from i don't
think that we can know that and i
certainly wouldn't trust any of our
uh intelligence sources on a question
like that
but
um i don't think we'll ever know where
it came from
um was stolen from the canadians
somebody says yeah we're just never
gonna know all right
here's my last opinion on india
the average asian india is less
could be that they're they get exposed
to more
things that tax their immune system so
maybe they're just more ready for it
but there's something going on
in india
and other places and we'd like to figure
it out and how did we get to this place
in the pandemic
without knowing the biggest cause of
what makes infections go up and down
how could we possibly be in this
situation
i mean it feels impossible doesn't it
that we could be in this situation
and
we still we still don't know the biggest
cause
of it
somebody says india is sweden yeah
everything you see on the internet that
says sweden did this and got this result
you should assume that that's all fake
or at least the credibility is zero some
of it might be real but you should treat
it as if it's all fake i don't think
there's there are any good charts about
covid on the internet
is my thinking
we talked about hydroxychloroquine they
didn't they didn't have enough pills
even available for their own population
that would have made this much
difference so even if it worked it
wouldn't have made that much difference
they didn't have that many pills
when is monsoon season
yeah i don't think it's weather i don't
think it's heat
it seems just how much strange you let
into your house i think that's just it
florida did it right
i i don't believe that
any of the leadership hypotheses will
hold up i don't believe that in the long
run you'll find that uh what florida did
was the smart leadership thing i don't
think you'll find that i think you'll
find that the biggest effects have
nothing to do with what our leaders did
and had a lot to do with
what the people did in their own house
probably
just my guess
schools never closed in sweden yeah
but all right oh yeah about kamala
taking over yeah so kamala harris is
taking calls with world leaders and it
is starting to look
as if they're just prepping her for the
job
um
and because masks are not mandatory it
doesn't mean people aren't watching them
that's correct so whenever you try to
compare sweden etc
it's hard to
factor in the fact that apparently the
swedes socially distance naturally
there's a whole lot of socially
distancing going on just naturally
don't they don't have many people per
household etc that might be the whole
story number of people per household
yes as somebody is asking here in in the
comments what brought the spanish flu to
an end
and the answer is we don't know
we don't know what stopped the spanish
flu think about that
it wasn't immunity because not enough
people got it
but
if we don't know what stopped the
spanish flu
we're really flying blind on this one
too i think
and i would have to say there must be
some kind of natural immunity that
people have because
i don't know what else it could be it's
got to be some kind of natural immunity
right
what else could it be
all right that's all i got for now and
i'll talk to you later
all
right go back to first principles
give me more
give me more than that i hear what
you're saying but i need some context
uh am i worried about the shot
i'm going to wait until the last minute
since it's not available to me i'm not
going to make a decision until it is
you please have montana skeptic and or
and or tesla charts on the show to
expose the elon musk fraud
well i don't know what fraud that is
but i wouldn't bet against elon musk
somebody says i had coven but no
antibodies do you know um apparently
uh false positive cova tests are a thing
uh i just heard of a number of them
recently in my
personal life
and um have i ever chatted with penn
gillette i have actually i've hung out
with penn gillette after one of his
shows in las vegas great guy i like him
a lot
um
i don't know what i was saying
never bet against elon musk i wouldn't
florida did a better because they did
not destroy their economy well here's
the thing we don't know why florida is
doing well
so florida and california acted
completely differently
and got the same result
ish or is it texas
might be texas and california but we
know that california acted completely
differently and got the same result as
as other people
um
did you miss the texans who were frozen
out from two tuning in it probably has a
pretty big effect on on viewership here
yeah
somebody says florida is not open and
free so they i'm sure they have
restrictions
yeah i do think that not destroying your
economy is important but in terms of the
number of infections it doesn't seem to
matter what leaders do
yeah so i will uh i'll give florida
credit for not destroying their economy
that's for sure
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to
