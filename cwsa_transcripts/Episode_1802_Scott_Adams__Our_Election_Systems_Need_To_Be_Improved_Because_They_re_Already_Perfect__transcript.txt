foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to what will be a peak experience for
you some of you will have your lives
completely transformed by this
and others will just have a great time
because I'm your
virtual friend
if you don't have enough people in your
life well I can help a little bit I'll
be here for about an hour every day same
time if you
you don't even have to see commercials
if you watch it live or you're watching
it recorded on some either the locals
platform no commercials there or
uh if you if you uh I guess if you
subscribe to YouTube YouTube
is it YouTube Red That You Don't See
commercials so I would say if you could
find an hour of fresh
non-commercial interrupted entertainment
you should be watching that and that is
what I give you but first
let's take it up a notch let's go all
the way
um all the way to
a couple of mug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea Stein I can't see Jerry classic
vessel any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
dope means the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
um I think I had like too much
I don't know did you catch that
I think my slurp to sip ratio was a
little high
anybody catch that needs to be about 10
percent less slurp
right you heard it and then a little bit
more sip see if I can ingest
you know work with me work with me
nailed it nailed it
that was exactly the right amount of
syrup slurp to sip
well president Trump has uh publicly
said that Elon Musk is another
artist quote unquote
um for say you would buy Twitter and
then saying you won't I guess and uh
Elon struck back he said in a tweet I
don't hate the man talking about Trump
he says I don't hate the man but it's
time for Trump to hang up his hat and
sail into the sunset
and then he says this is the interesting
part Dem should also call off the attack
don't make it so that Trump's only way
to survive is to regain the presidency
do you know that the Democrats could win
every election if they just listened to
Elon Musk
uh all they have to do is take his
advice
because I'm going to talk to you a
little bit about how they don't
understand the systems
it's like Democrats understand an
individual topic you know well enough
but as soon as those topics are combined
to make some kind of a system
then Elon Musk can see it
because that's what he does I mean his
whole his whole thing is seeing the
whole picture and have all the parts fit
together and so here he is explaining to
the Democrats that they're actively
actively screwing themselves
they're making it so Trump's only option
is to become the president of the United
States which is also the only thing the
Democrats don't want
so they're working hard
to get the thing they most don't want
Elon Musk can see it
I can see it
you know I mean I didn't I don't think
I've ever articulated that but you see
that you've thought of yourself haven't
you have you not thought that if they
just treated Trump with respect and said
you know you gave a good first term for
your base
but your base is not the world
and now the the rest of the world wants
a shot at it it'd be really easy to
treat him with respect and let him go
off as an honored you know honored
Statesman or something even if they
didn't feel that way but they are
creating the only situation that could
get him reelected
that's the only situation because if his
supporters see how heavy-handedly
you know he's being attacked without
basis it's really going to get people
fired up so the Democrats are firing up
the Republican Basin I don't know if
that's going to work out for him
my favorite story and I didn't know if
if anybody figured out what's really
going on but there's some reporting from
CNN in which CNN does know exactly
what's going on and the story is that
Bannon
who had said he would not uh testify
before the January 6 committee has been
urged according to CNN has been urged to
testify
because Trump wanted somebody on his
side to be talking publicly now
it's going to be live
all right
oh the somebody's saying that
the artist was
uh the context was that musk had told
Trump that he voted for him but publicly
must said that he only voted Democrat
before
so
who knows but the the important part is
it was you know a artist
comment it really doesn't matter why
but thank you thank you for that
correction
am I am I the only uh
show that gets fact checked in real time
does anybody else do that
I think I am right
now does that work for you because no
doubt you hear me say things that you
know are incorrect
I mean you know I wouldn't even pretend
that I get all the facts right that's
not even a standard I would be shooting
for
because it's not possible
but I think I'm the only person who does
this and gets fact checked in real time
and here's the important part
and I accept the fact checks
nobody else does that there's nobody
else who will change their mind we're
right in front of you because because
the fact came in but I do it all the
time and I feel like that's like the
most valuable thing I do
I doubt there's anything more valuable
that I can do than change my mind in
public because the data changed right in
front of me you know and you watched it
happen in real time
might be the most useful thing I ever do
anyway watching banon testify
I don't know how expensive the ticket
would have to be for that
that I wouldn't buy it
so if they said to me well this is going
to be pay-per-view bannon's testimony
but it's going to be a hundred dollars
per person
I'd pay it
let's say five hundred dollars
a ticket to watch this is five hundred
dollars you probably wouldn't pay it
I'd bet
I'd pay 500 to watch Bannon testify
five hundred dollars I don't think I'd
go up to a thousand
but I would pay actually literally five
hundred dollars for that level of
retaining entertainment
do you think that is gonna be the best
thing you ever saw
seriously just just uh do a little
mental experiment where you put Bannon
in your mind
in front of the January 6 committee and
think of all the things that they've
claimed and said and how they frame
things
think about the fact that there's been
no public pushback you're within the
committee
and that Bannon
is not an amateur
that's what's fun
what's fun is if you told me Jim Jordan
was going to do this
I wouldn't care
I would say Okay Jim Jordan will say all
the things Jim Jordan says and nobody
will pay attention
right
if you told me you know pick pick any
other Republican besides Trump pick
anybody besides Trump
let's say it's Roger Stone
well you know Roger Stone will be Roger
Stone he'll make some news but maybe the
needle won't move right
um any Senator any Congress person
um you know there are a number of
conservatives who are sort of named as
part of the plot if any of them were
going to testify how interesting would
it be a little bit
be a little bit interesting
but
Bandit
have you fully wrapped your hand around
what's what's in front of us
Bannon
is going to dig up your corpse
right in front of you on live TV
you're going to watch Bandon just like
figuratively speaking walk out in front
of the whole world with a shovel
and they're going to say Mr Bannon can
you answer this question and he might
answer it you might not but in the
context of talking
he's going to start digging up
a coffin dude
yeah I'll answer that question yeah
January 6 was uh very unfortunate
hey look what's under there everybody
look look there's a dead body right
there
and nobody's talking about it well I'm
on live TV you put me on live
TV neener
it's gonna be so much fun
Bannon is going to take a big old bag of
salt and rub it in their wounds right on
live TV
now it's only because it's bad and then
it's interesting
because he's not going to hold back and
he has the skill to you know to land
punches
there's nobody else I can think of that
you would want to even put in that
position and trust them
to you to pull it off yeah not Matt
Gates because he's got a U.S baggage he
can't be Rudy Giuliani it can't be any
of the attorneys right it's got to be
somebody who is close to the situation
and and really has these skills now the
fact that Bannon is also now a famous
podcaster
I can tell you for sure that doing this
every day you know talking to people
live
that I do every day
and maybe you can confirm this you've
seen how it started
have you not seen me develop
public communication skills while you
watched
right
I mean I think like give me a fact Jack
of that have you not seen me from the
beginning of the live streams toward the
end develop develop a skill of uh you
know putting a thought together while
people are watching it's not easy
it's not easy to have complex thoughts
while people are watching
it's it's tough it just takes practice
like everything else so so
of getting confirmation on the locals
platform that I I used to suck and I
think you're right that was even my own
opinion you know when I started doing
this I thought wow I'm really bad at
this
but I also I'm not embarrassed by things
so I like doing it so I kept doing it
and I think I got better I mean that
would be my own opinion but Baden is
he's uh he's fight tested
and he's in top
um fight shape like he's ready for the
he's ready for the uh the you know
welterweight Championship or whatever it
is
well uh we've got a new poll result uh
Rasmussen he asked people what they
thought about abolishing the Supreme
Court
a majority of Democrats voters not just
Democrats but voters I believe the
Supreme Court is a racist sexist
institution that ought to be abolished
and the young people aged 19 to 39 feel
the same way
and let's say 53 percent of Democrats
are in favor of abolishing the current
Supreme Court but
but replacing it with a different entity
right so if you if you only read the
headline it looks it looks crazy you
know abolish the Supreme Court so
probably nobody's in favor of that
but even the people who want to abolish
it want it replaced with a court that is
selected by the public
so instead of having the elected people
nominate the court you know the usually
the uh the power the party in power
uh there are a lot of Democrats who say
it'd be better if the public at Large
elected the court
so in other words the Democrats want to
abolish the Supreme Court and create a
system where
uh elected representatives
make the decisions
it's what's that reminding me of an
entity within the U.S government in
which elected representatives
are making the law
that's uh oh yeah Congress that's right
Democrats
by a majority
wanted to just create a second Congress
but smaller
what this is the dumbest thing
I've ever seen in my life so I'm not
sure even people answering that question
we're all on the same page about their
assumptions when they when they answered
it but I don't know if this means
anything
except that is more proof that Democrats
don't know how to design their system
remember my theme
so my theme today is that Elon Musk said
look you're not seeing all the moving
Parts if you're if you're going up to
Trump you don't realize that you've
backed them into a corner where he has
to run for president to protect himself
don't see all the moving Parts it's the
reason that they're not bothered by
socialism
because the Republicans say wait I get
the part where people get some you know
help in the beginning but how does how
do all the parts work it doesn't work
because you know incentives are wrong
and stuff
it's the same it's the same damn thing
over and over again the Democrats don't
seem able
to think Beyond a single variable
they seem one variable thinkers whereas
Republicans are consistently system
thinkers how does this variable affect
this one Etc you see the same thing over
and over it doesn't matter what topic it
is and I don't think it's a coincidence
because even Democrats in their Quiet
Moments will say that Republicans are
better at business
have you ever heard that
do you know any Democrats who are
definitely Democrats but in their Quiet
Moments they're like well you know the
Republicans are pretty good at business
stuff
have you heard that you know they'll
also say they're liars and cheaters or
whatever but but that I think they do
admit that Republicans have some kind of
a a weird Edge in business
I don't know if it's true by the way but
I you know it's sort of a thing people
say
all right um
yesterday I contacted my Democrat friend
now I've anonymously referred to him
over a number of years because he's sort
of my example of a real life person who
believes everything that the mainstream
media tells them
actually everything
let me say that again
I'm talking about a very well educated
like more educated than I am I'm highly
educated and he's he's a whole other
level right if you looked at reputations
of schools and stuff
um so there's a whole other level of
Education
almost perfectly informed meaning that
he reads the news every day about
politics now when I say perfectly
informed I don't mean he has correct
information I mean he has the
information from his news sources
so if I quiz him on any story which I
did like do you know about this story do
you know about this angle he knew them
all
so there was nothing I had to say that
he hadn't heard of but
he only heard the left's version of it
and when I would present them with the
the alternate context or Baxter
information I thought by now that the
complete that the complete complete
that's a complete uh destruction of
Biden's reputation
and the fact that you know Trump in some
ways looks better but not with the
January 6th stuff
um I thought this would be a good time
to contact him because he would have
some humility about his own opinion that
Biden would do a good job now let me
tell you what a really smart honest
person and also here's the other thing
he's very honest
right one of the reasons he was a good
friend for years he's very honest to a
fault right he he's not going to hold
back bad news or good news so very smart
very well informed just on the news from
the left
and very honest
and now he's seen everything that you've
seen for the last two years with Biden
and so I checked in with him to see if
we could find some common ground
I started with some common ground which
we could fight
which was do we both agree that Trump
should not be president next time
I don't know if I've said this directly
but I'm going to say this directly as I
possibly can I don't think he should be
president again
I do think he did a good job on the
things he cared about in a number of
ways in the first term
I don't think you should be our next
president
so what I said I'm not going to support
him for a president again you know we
immediately bonded on that which was
what I hoped
but then I thought you know I think
maybe I can get
maybe a little flexibility on his side
and I said now that you've seen Biden
operating for a couple years
do you think you got what you wanted you
know was that the outcome you wanted now
he admitted that maybe some other
Democrat might have been a better choice
but he was willing to give up nothing
nothing on Biden's performances so far
nothing
that has actually been fine
and that there haven't been any problems
that there wouldn't have been otherwise
you know
and by the way on some of them I agree
the withdrawal from Afghanistan he would
agree was botched
but unfortunately I agree with him that
it probably would have been botched no
matter who the president was because I
don't think the president was looking at
the military details I think the
president was simply taking the advice
of the people who should have known what
they're talking about and I think both
the presidents would have done that
wrong in my opinion now if you say
yeah I I see a lot of pushback on this
your pushback is well-founded
your pushback is well-founded meaning if
you thought the odds were good the odds
were good not certainly but if he
thought the odds were good that Trump
would have handled that better
I I actually agree with you I would
agree with you
can you handle that nuance
if you're just looking at the odds
of Biden Henley versus Trump I think the
odds were better
I think Trump's odds are better but I
don't think they were good
can we can I shave it that way I think
his odds were unambiguously better but
not good because I think they were both
operating on terrible information and
how how would Trump have better
information they're all getting it from
the same Source right
so so I want to be consistent
with things I know are true
and things that are just some
statistical likelihood so so I wanted to
you know give some flexibility so it
didn't become a fight and I want to say
you know
there is no evidence that Trump would
have done this better I have a feeling
he would have but it's just speculation
right so would I put my speculation up
against this question not really
I don't think my speculation has enough
power to do that
so there were some cases where he
defended Biden in a way that I thought
was you know capable
not my opinion but not terrible
and thought that uh and this and now
here's the next thing now this I believe
is a pure example of
confirmation bias or maybe cognitive
distance
and it was that he said that Biden
clearly you know maybe needs more rest
because of his age but there's no
evidence of cognitive impairment
none
at least not in any scary way and if you
were to compare that
to what he believed was Trump's
cognitive uh let's say integrity
he says that Trump would be way scarier
way more dangerous because of his mental
health than Biden and that Biden is
actually perfectly coherent when he does
off the cuff answers and though only
when he reads his uh teleprompter is he
not good at it so my very smart very
honest and very informed friend
believes that Biden is only bad when
he's reading
but when he's talking to you off the
cuff he's completely there no problem at
all as in not 10 degraded not five
percent degraded just all there he's got
it all
now
which one of us is in cognitive
dissonance
am I because I predicted it would happen
so therefore I'm just seeing what I
predicted duh of course I would
or is he
is it just obvious to the entire world
that Biden has some issues now and he's
just won't change his mind
here's the answer to that I don't know
I don't know how would I know the the
issue is that one of us clearly is
having a perceptual problem or both
right you can't rule out that we're both
wrong and it's some third answer
but we do know that we're having
one of us is having a serious delusion
can you ever rule out that it's you
if you're at a lower level of awareness
you do that you say well it's the other
person who's having the hallucination
because I would know if I was
hallucinating
no you wouldn't that's how
hallucinations work it's not a
hallucination if you know it's not real
it's a hallucination at least the way
I'm using it here it's a hallucination
if you think it's actually real
so anyway
um here's some more things that I
learned from my Democrat friend sort of
as a proxy for other people
uh the Biden's gaffs don't mean anything
he's mentally fine just needs a little
more rest there's there's no evidence of
him doing a bad job
there's no evidence of Biden doing a bad
job it's all fine okay
um and I think you could argue that the
things might have been pretty bad under
any president because you know we do
have a pandemic and stuff like that
if if Trump had been president there was
still a pandemic right we don't know
what Trump's performance would have been
do I think it would have been better yes
I do and I can give you lots of reasons
for it but do I know it
no I don't no I don't it can't be known
Nobody Knows the future
if you think you'd know the future
I don't want to listen to you if you
think you have a really strong idea okay
that might be reasonable
all right here's some other things
um
yeah I said you he was glad that Trump
uh might be prevented from running again
because if Trump became president he
would surely destroy the world in a
nuclear blast did it matter that I
explained to him that Trump had made
North Korea
go from looking like a nuclear war any
minute to I'm not really worthy of the
news
and I said you know that he stopped the
only major nuclear confrontation that
we've had in decades he stopped it he
stopped it cold
but my friend still thinks he's the most
dangerous
so by not creating a war and stopping a
nuclear you know escalating
confrontation who knows if it would have
been nuclear but it was escalated
by doing all those things the most peace
related president so he withdrew from
Afghanistan stopped a nuclear
confrontation
uh did a trade war with China that
didn't start any major war it was
actually you know sort of got away with
it
um
every piece of evidence about Trump
suggests he would be the safest
president in terms of international
conflicts everything
but
but my Democrat friends is exactly the
opposite he has bought completely that
you can predict how he would act in the
future
now you can tell there's something
mentally incompetent won't do a good job
I mean there's some things that are
obvious but do you think that based on
the fact that in Trump's first term
he did the most to create World Peace of
any president
that's all we know
that his first term he did more to
create World Peace than any president
so what would you think about his second
term
do you take your first term and all that
you've learned in a whole bunch of
different categories
I mean every I mean who saw a prison
reform coming from Trump who saw that
Trump apparently as he governed
was very much about protecting Americans
whether they were Americans in jail or
American Military he was basically
protecting Americans like crazy but my
Democrat friend thinks he would
recklessly got a skilled
is he wrong
I don't know
how would anybody know what the future
holds it doesn't seem likely based on
what we do know about Trump's first term
he was running in the exact opposite
direction of getting us in trouble as
fast as he could
and succeeded
so
here's another thing that uh
my Democrat friend believed because one
of the things I like to do is say if you
believe this is true
then you have accepted as an assumption
X and then I'll explain the X couldn't
possibly be true and therefore the whole
Theory Must Fall Apart because it's
based on an assumption that even you
don't believe could be true
all right
um here it is
laughs
that my my friend believes that Trump
was literally uh he was literally trying
to take over the country and the coup
the January 6 was a coup attempt
even though we know from the documents
and the testimonies or actually from
digital documents that Don Jr was not on
board
and I said to him is it your belief that
Trump was trying to run a Insurrection
an actual Insurrection and Don Jr wasn't
on board
and they were still going ahead
and he said yes
or I think maybe he didn't answer it
directly and I said what about you know
all of his other advisors who are not
lawyers
I said was there anybody in the Trump
team anybody who wasn't a lawyer
who was who was on his side to you know
keep this thing going
and I haven't heard of any just lawyers
right so if you look at what we know now
from the January 6th thing it should
have totally cleared him
because it showed he had no support for
anything like an Insurrection and then
it also showed and now we've seen more
testimony that Trump simply believed the
election was rigged there was obviously
rigged according to him
I don't think it's that obvious and or I
don't think it's obvious or I don't know
if it was rigged or not
but
um so we have an evidence that Trump
probably really believed it was Rick now
I asked my friend I said
true or false I mean I'm paraphrasing
the longer conversation but
if Trump actually believed the election
was rigged would you still call it an
insurrection
and that's where it gets real dicey
right
because his entire opinion was based on
the fact that Trump knew he lost
and I said how would you know that
how could you possibly how could he know
it and how would you know he secretly
knew it
when you both know it's unknowable
why do you why does your entire and I
said to him your entire opinion about
this is based on an assumption that you
know can't be known
which is what do you the voter think
Trump was secretly thinking even though
a hundred percent of his communication
was in a different direction and then he
said well no we have actual a recording
of trump
guilty trying to rig the election
and I said what yeah what do you talk to
rasenberger and he said I only need you
to find the votes it's right there
there's your evidence that he tried to
rig the election
to which I said you know
the only way that makes sense is if
you're using a word in the way it's not
used in any real context that nobody
uses the word find
when they mean construct or lie or
pretend
and he said no that's that's your mafia
talk
you know he's like a mafia guy yeah he
knew people were listening so he just
put it in Mafia talk where he said fine
yeah yeah you just go you find me those
votes
to which I say
how do you know when somebody's doing
Mafia talk
and do you know how
you have to know what they're thinking
and then it would make sense that that's
what they mean so if you knew somebody
was the head of the mafia
would you think that what they were
saying maybe meant you know if they had
it the mafia said hey
Scott
you know that guy who's been not paying
his uh his uh blackmail money to us
I want you to take care of him
right and then I murder him and and uh
there's a court case and they say hey
you know why'd you do it and I said I
was just following orders you know he
told me to to kill him
and then he says no I've got it in
writing I told you to take care of him
There's an actual case where that was
real
it was in World War II A friend of mine
his father was captured and beheaded by
the Japanese military
but he was beheaded for entertainment
not not for a specific crime he was a
prisoner of war
and as it came out in the the war trials
that came out after that the the prison
camp would sometimes entertain the
troops by beheading captured Americans
and so they would bring the captured
Americans out and have them dig their
own hole
where they were going to be pushed into
once their head had been chopped off
and then they would uh they would beat
them before they took them out so they
had to get them you know good and beaten
and then they would tie them to a steak
with sort of their head over the hole
and then the Japanese soldiers would
gather around and cheer and stuff and
they had an official executor who had
like a you know really sharp sword and
you'd make sure that it was like
ceremonial and they'd put the prisoner
over there and they they'd Lop off the
prisoner's head which is what happened
to his father his father said he was
lopped off the other prisoners who were
next
would watch
and then they would go next
for entertainment
now when the when the war
um the war trials happened
the the camp that did this and the
commander of that camp said that he was
just following orders
and he said that there was a uh
the command came and there was a word
that could be interpreted two different
ways
and it was just like that take care of
him so there was a Japanese word show
bun I think I forget the word but I
think it can be interpreted as you know
kill him or literally take care of them
and so their defense was
hey they told us to kill them it's right
here in writing show bun that there's
the word says kill him and so we kill
him we're just following orders
and the jury
said no under in that context you knew
to take care of them and take care of
them and you did what you know you do
what you do
um right so now in the case of trump
was he a Mafia Boss
in which you would definitely interpret
it or you know like the a prison camp
murderer where you would definitely
interpret what you said as the worst
version
or was he an American president with
lots of people watching who would have
gone to jail
and he would know that if he asked for
an election to be rigged in front of all
people he would know that
now are there any mafia people
who do their thing in front of witnesses
who are not you know scared of
testifying in the future
do you know of any uh like Mafia people
who who put on a hit but they just do it
at Starbucks where other people can hear
them like you're the mafia boss you say
in front of the other people at the
table Yeah I want you to take care of
that guy
take care of it
and then then the mafia guy thinks it's
fine I can say this is Starbucks because
they're just gonna think I'm saying take
care of that guy
no no the mafia person even if they say
take care of them they don't do it in
front of witnesses I mean unless the
witnesses or other Mafia people but
they're not going to do it in front of
like a collection of people who just
happen to be on the phone call
I don't think that happens
um I'm getting a definition of the word
show bun it means dispose of or punish
I think dispose of my maybe maybe was
the one that was the uh
controversial one you know dispose might
be um get them out of the camps or
something I don't know so I may have
some of the details wrong but that's the
general idea
um here's something else my Democrat
friend believe he believes that all of
the ex all of the elections were fully
audited
all of the elections were fully audited
and that if there were any errors we
would know it
meaning that even if there was something
they didn't check
we would still notice the discrepancy
and then we would check it so there are
no discrepancies which have not been
checked
do you believe that there are no
election discrepancies
alleged that have not been checked and
then I said
that's not true and he said Scott's got
there have been 60 court cases where it
was all shown to be nonsense claims and
thrown out
and I said but you're well informed and
so you know that they were mostly thrown
out for standing
which he did he actually knew that they
were mostly thrown out for standing
buddy they also and he made a good point
which is if there had been any real ones
it wouldn't you know wouldn't matter if
they were thrown out for standing we'd
know about it we'd at least know about
it but we don't
so
so he does make an interesting case
which I committed that I would go fact
check
and it goes like this
is there a way to know that the election
was fair
because in theory there could be
I just don't know if it's designed that
way and I think it's not
so we'll talk about that in a second
how do you know something was fair
you could say we found no evidence that
it wasn't fair
but in order to go all the way to we
know it was fair because we would have
noticed anything that was unfair
that is I feel like that is just pure
brainwashing
do you
and again I would accept well Scott I
think there's a 99 chance it was fair
because you know we would almost
certainly notice any discrepancies
had he said 99 percent
I would have said I disagree with that
it's too high but at least you're
thinking in percentages and so I'm
that's good
but he doesn't say 99 he says a hundred
I mean he didn't use the word 100 but
his argument was there's no wiggle room
here we would notice it if it were big
enough to change an election
so I said what about those 57 precincts
that got zero votes for Trump
what do you say to that
so it was in the news recently and can
somebody give me a fact check I think it
was in the mainstream news wasn't it
I mean I tweeted it the other days let
me see it okay everybody tell me what
source it was I forget
oh is it Romney
it was Romney not Trump
oh okay so the example was from the past
but it demonstrates that an election you
know could be suspicious and I don't
think anything changed so yeah so they
were allegedly 57 or 59 precincts
somewhere where Romney got zero votes
and statistically that's sort of
impossible
uh
you're making a terrible uh point there
in that brainwash coming I see what
you're saying but you need to make a
clearer point
all right uh what does my friend do for
a living he's not an artist
he's is in a a solid well understood uh
business
field that's not technical so it's not a
technical field this is a straight and
he's very successful
so he's a he's a business person with
long track record of success
all right
um
so that was his argument and so I asked
you I I said but do you understand that
the election is now fully auditable that
you can't get into the digital parts
and he again kept his argument that if
if there had been any problems we'd
notice and it made me ask this question
now we know that the election is
designed so that your name and your
identifiers are removed from your vote
by the time your vote reaches whatever
final database
and I learned that there's a reason for
that the reason that they anonymize your
vote is if they didn't you could prove
who you voted for and then you could
sell your vote apparently that was a big
problem before that law was enacted rich
people would just say hey if you can
prove you voted for the person I want
you to I'll pay you a dollar or whatever
so they had to prove it and then they'd
get their money but if you can't prove
your vote made it into the final
database you can't get paid you could
say you voted to get paid and then the
rich person's saying not so sure prove
it
so
here's what I don't know about how our
election system is designed
if you make the vote Anonymous does that
also make it impossible to audit
or do you just do it a different way for
example
let's say the local voting machines in a
Precinct got a certain result and has
said Trump got X number of votes and
Biden got X number of votes but then
they removed the names from the votes
if you still had the totals the
subtotals
and then at the final database before
it's recorded
they could check back and say okay what
were your vote totals okay let's make
sure that that's the final vote total
wouldn't you in that case if it's
designed that way that's my question if
it's designed that way wouldn't just the
raw subtotals be all you needed to know
that the digital part worked
because every time you check the the raw
subtitles raw counts the subtotals they
would be right if if the system worked
right
so am I right that it's not a problem to
remove your identifiers
as long as the subtotals can be checked
all the way to the Final Destination yes
or no
they can audit by the registration to
the peoples who signed in
no they can't I mean they can't audit
all the way to the destination because
that's anonymized
uh Washington State's process it works
well and you can verify your vote well
that would be illegal if you can verify
your vote that would be a legal
federally Wouldn't It Maybe not maybe
that's a state thing so I have some
questions whether there's a state that
allows you to verify your vote because
in theory then you could sell your vote
that's the whole point
so I think you did a fact check on that
or I do I don't know that there's any
place you can check your vote all the
way to the and
so it's true about Washington State
so the state can have a something that's
out of whack with the federal government
of course of course again
you can verify you voted just not for
who okay that's I think I got the
explanation Washington verifies that
your vote was recorded but not for whom
right is that it because that would
satisfy everything
uh right
same in Santa Claus okay I think we
solved that so you could tell you voted
but it won't uh determine who you voted
for and the final thing so that should
leave some room for fraud
now what about the people who say the
voting machines were all tested
and they were found not to have any
problems
are you comfortable let's say there were
I don't know 100 000 voting machines
from different companies and you took 10
from each of them and you test them you
know randomly selected 10.
would you feel comfortable that if you
tested 10 of them and they checked out
that the ones you didn't test
would be good
and who who would be the one who told
you which ones to test
would that be the company that makes
them
who is it who decides which ones get
tested now maybe it's the people who own
them because they bought them from the
company and they just say oh just test
these ones Maybe
but
here's the thing have you ever heard of
the Volkswagen case
it was a not too long ago where
Volkswagen got caught uh writing some
software for their Emissions Control
where if you tested it it tested
perfectly because the software said just
show it's good
but when you actually ran the car the
software changed into an operating mode
and uh polluted like crazy but helped
the the performance of the car
it was called dieselgate right and V
Volkswagen lied about it right and it
became a big thing but once they
discovered it they found it so let me
ask you this
could a hacker theoretically
create a a system where when you tested
the voting machine it tested right but
when you used it it didn't
is that possible
let me tell you how I would do it if I
were a hacker and I'm not I'm not
suggesting this happened I just want to
know what would stop it from hacking so
let's say I worked for the company that
makes the machines so I have access and
so I put some code in there
and the code says if it's an election
day 2020
you will run this program that will move
some votes around illegally and then
when you're done you will delete
yourself
or go dormant
forever and nothing can wake you up
again once you've operated once
now you've got to test it
it was a one-time operation it was
designed to only work once and then
disappear so they test it and they say
do the votes we put in equal the votes
that came out and and they do
so just like Volkswagen the hid the
emission control by coding it to test
correctly but operating incorrectly
could they not hide
a hack
I mean I'm not a hacker but I have
programmed and I don't see why you
couldn't
and then somebody said but wait
it would be obvious because something
would be missing like the the deleted
code you'd notice it was missing
how would you notice something was
missing
it just wouldn't be there
how do you notice it's not there
all you know is it's not there
you don't know it disappeared
so you know one can imagine ways that
you could catch these things but what I
don't know is if yeah one can imagine a
way that you would catch that kind of
crime you can imagine it but do you know
if the system is designed that way
I don't maybe it is yeah I know you
could do the checksums ETC but there
still has to be a way to fudge it after
it leaves the voting machine
uh
uh what is the point that we don't know
anything we have damn friends the point
is that the mainstream media has
convinced Democrats that there's a
hundred percent no ability about whether
our systems were were good
and to me that seems like such a naive
assumption that it has to be cognitive
dissonance because I can't imagine a
reasonable person looking at such a
complex system run by 50 different
entities different you know different
laws different software different
machines and that all of them were fine
you know it's perfectly fine to say it
works well enough
but I don't know all right
so my friend thinks that everything was
audited there's no way to fake it we
would know it by now if anybody did
anything big of course rejected all the
cases and therefore we know that
election was fair
and and if that wasn't enough the word
find as in fine votes is proof that
Trump had intention to lie and therefore
knows that it was a faked vote
to which I say
no every one of those words is
consistent with he believed the election
was rigged and if you did a better job
of counting you'd know it too
how does somebody see the opposite of
that
remember I told you that we're we've
reached a new level where we can't tell
the difference between the thing and the
opposite of the thing
it's another example
um
but then I finally realized why it's why
Democrats were so easily misled
into thinking that the word find means
go do something illegal and lie and
manufacture do you know why do you know
why Democrats think that the word
defined votes
is equal to manufacture votes do you
know why
it's because they're socialists
they don't know what it means to
manufacture something
they just find it
do you know where uh socialists get
money
they find it in the banks of rich people
that's how they make money the way the
way socialists acquire assets is they
find it
did they earn it did they make something
no they found it
a rich a rich person made something
a rich person manufactured and then made
money and then the Socialist said I
don't have any money
what am I going to do
because I need food I need some money I
don't have any money
what do people do to get money
I guess I'm gonna have to find something
where's some money
wait a minute
found the money
it's in the banks of the rich people
I found it
now do you think I'm joking
I'm not
I'm not this is an entire political
movement that thinks that money
is something you find because other
people have it and all you need is a
rule that says once we found it we can
take it from you that is socialism
we found it it's not a joke
if if you're a Republican and you think
that the way you make money is by
manufacturing stuff
the word find means exactly what it
means in English you found it it doesn't
mean you
created it doesn't mean you manufactured
it manufacturing is a whole different
thing than finding but if you live on
the left
they can't tell the difference
their entire philosophy depends on not
knowing the difference between making
stuff and finding it when somebody else
made it
Am I Wrong
excuse me
how many of you are having like a moment
right now
where you just realize that that's true
I don't think it was mentioned that
before but I realized that yesterday
all right
um
let's say did everybody see Tucker
Carlson's uh monologue about the Biden
family still stealing Millions well
actually not stealing but the Biden
family making millions by selling access
to the government to China
now
correct me if I'm wrong
but all of the facts are in evidence now
right
am I wrong that there's nothing that
Tucker Carlson says about this case
nothing there isn't in evidence and
generally agreed by all of us right and
what he's describing is something that's
clearly illegal or at the very least is
disqualifying for office you know
and we all know it and we all see it and
we're just simply not doing anything
about it
right
we're simply not doing it about it
please read the James Bond comment
somebody says
was it a comment about James Bond or was
James Bond the commenter
all right well let me know if I miss it
I don't know what Yes means all right if
I miss it let me know
but
um
here's the weird thing about this story
we've reached a point where if a
Democrat murders somebody on Fifth
Avenue
their supporters wouldn't care
uh bond is a commenter all right what
did James Bond say
um colonialism was capitalism no that's
not it
all right
yeah somebody want to tell me that you
seem to care about it but if if you
can't tell me what it is I can't deal
with it all right
so watch watching Tucker uh lay that all
out again you know I think I think
Tucker has reached national treasure
status for doing the things that nobody
else is doing and the way he frames
things I think is just brilliant most of
the time
um
I don't know what to do with the fact
that he just described a president
clearly breaking the law and nothing's
happening about it
now is the thing that's going to happen
you have to wait for a republican to get
an office and investigate it
and that it won't matter because you
know Biden won't be president
and I don't really care if China
gives money to the Biden family as long
as they're not buying access so you know
once Biden's out of office
I guess we're just going to not care
anymore right we'll just stop caring so
I don't I think that
I think that they literally are breaking
the law in front of everybody and
nobody cares
by this approval has reached you know
crazy levels of loness now
um
by disapproval in the 18 to 29 year old
according to a New York Times Seattle
was 19 approved
so young people
fewer than 20 percent approve of it
wow and then Guy Benson was tweeting
today about
um
about the same poll but I guess it was a
about the pessimism about the direction
uh Americans are more pessimistic about
the direction of the country now than
they were in the coven shutdown and
after the cattle riots basically people
are super pessimistic now
do you think that's right that they
should be
pessimistic
I'm not pessimistic I believe that we're
being fooled
by Relentless you know illegitimate
reporting
and that things are actually in pretty
good shape
now inflation still scares me
but a lot of things scare me they get
fixed I just it's just not I'm just not
the one who knows how to fix it
yeah Biden I think just served his
purpose and will be gone and he'll just
Shuffle off
um
all right I think things are fine
actually believe it or not
I I think if you were to look at uh not
the pandemic I mean the pandemic was a
mess but at the moment
I don't think we've ever been in better
shape
isn't that weird with all of the
problems that are completely real yeah
you respectfully disagree I'll tell you
the part that worries me the most is our
Mental Health
our mental health I think in terms of
our physical well-being we're probably
in pretty good shape
but our mental health is just and
social media is doing that to us clearly
Jordan Peterson had a video in which he
was talking about the research you know
Jonathan hate and others showing that
social media is basically ruining our
brains we're just not we didn't evolve
to be able to handle social media it's
showing uh
all right
that
is all I want to talk about
today
and so I would like if anybody has a
source
that would tell us how much of our
election system is audited or even how
much is vulnerable because let me tell
you what the let me end on a high like
an interesting note
let me tell you two things that
Democrats have told us and Republicans
do
uh but Democrats mostly since 2015.
the Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats tried
to pass a uh election Integrity kind of
a bill
and the idea was to have the federal
government enforce some standards on the
states so that the state elections would
have to be at least up to the standard
of the national requirement and I think
there was a
you know almost 700 million of funding
so there's real money
to fix the security of the system
and to fix the Integrity now that bill
was defeated
by the Republicans and I believe a
Democrat it was probably pointed out
that no that's a republican problem
because the Democrats tried to fix the
election the Republicans wouldn't vote
for it so it didn't happen therefore if
there's any problem with the election
well talk to the Republicans they had a
chance to fix it and they didn't
but
the bill had a poison pill in it
poison for for republicans
it was taking away state rights
that's what it was they were taking the
state's ability to do the election any
any damn way they want and they were
saying how about we'll alter the
Constitution
without altering the Constitution and
suddenly make the federal government get
in the in the pants of the states
now if you make a bill like that
have you not
made a poison pill that you know the the
Republicans can't vote for
is that not of a bill that's designed to
fail
because name one other bill that
succeeded when it took power from the
states and gave it to the federal
government
have Republicans ever voted for that
okay maybe can somebody give me an
example have Republicans ever voted for
anything
that was clearly moving
rights from the states that were granted
those rights by the Constitution
to the federal government
when have Republicans ever voted for
that
Brady Bill Patriot Act red flag laws
interesting
so uh there there are several examples
here
but the reason it was uh that's good
context that's good to know so there are
examples when that's happened
at least you say
I'll take your word for it
uh
oh Raskin will be recorded behind closed
doors
are you are you saying that Bannon will
not be live
so maybe there's something in that Trump
letter that I didn't see
yeah
anyway so here's our situation the
Democrats themselves have tried to fix
the election systems in the States
because the Democrats say uh we're going
to put 700 million dollars Beyond it
because it's a real big problem that our
elections are not secure
the so far everybody would agree that's
a fact I mean you could Google it I
think it was 2015 or so Democrats tried
to fix the elections because they
believed they were not secure they were
vulnerable
and they did not get it through because
the Republicans said you know don't mess
with the states
now so the Republicans have told us
that they needed to fix the system
because it's clearly broken and so
clearly broken that you would put 700
million dollars toward fixing it you
have to be pretty sure don't you that
it's broken broken in the sense that
there are obvious vulnerabilities
now they're telling us that the current
election was definitely good
so were they proposing to waste the 700
million dollars because apparently we
can tell if an election was good just by
looking at it
they were either going to waste 700
million dollars or they're lying to you
and they know the election cannot be
guaranteed that it was
um Fair they can't both be true
so who in the media has asked a Democrat
that question who is let's say involved
in the 2015 thing in 2015 you were so
sure that the elections were not secure
enough that you're willing to vote for
almost a billion dollars to fix it
so if you were going to spend a billion
dollars to fix something
but now you say that it's so perfect
that you would be able to spot
any cheating
already
which is all you really need right if
you could spot the cheating
that's probably good enough
so
they've actually sold us that the
election is broken and perfect at the
same time
and we accepted it
remember I told you that we've reached a
place where the thing and the opposite
are you can't you can't tell them apart
Democrats have told us two messages the
election is is broken and it's going to
take a billion dollars to fix it and
they produce perfect results with no uh
question about the outcome
they're broken and have to be fixed
but they give you results you can trust
at the same time at the same time and by
the way
Who besides me
even said that and I don't think there's
anything that you can't fact check in
what I just said right it's pretty right
out there
right
so
the amazing ability of the news to
misdirect you because isn't isn't that
the most important question let me let
me tell you here's a dog not barking or
a thing you didn't see
if I could do this that I can't do this
because I don't I don't have the
knowledge if I could draw a picture of
our election system like a graphic it
says you know here's a little picture of
a voting booth and here's the digital
Trail and here's where the ballot goes
if I could draw that for let's say one
representative state
and then I could say to you all right
here are all the parts of our system
from the first part to the final
database and all the things in between
and then I say to you we can or cannot
audit
which of these boxes now I'd start with
a voting machine and I'd say well you
can recount the ballots because you have
the the physical ballot and then you see
us the machine counted it right yes so
that would be something in in most or
all cases where you definitely could
audit that and you might even notice if
there was a problem in the first place I
don't know how
like maybe zero votes for one person but
in theory
you could do that
but I don't understand enough about the
other boxes in what would be the entire
election system to be able to tell you
all right so this first part is really
you don't have to worry about it because
that part we can check completely but
what about the second partner and the
third part the fourth part the fifth
part the fact that you know the
employees of companies that make these
things have access to it what about all
that
if I ask you how do we know no Insider
has ever
changed anything
if somebody really understands the
system because they say oh don't worry
about it of course we thought of that
when we decided the system no you'd
never get away with that it would be so
obvious
would they say that
do you know I don't know so here's the
thing that's missing where's the graphic
a picture that shows all the parts of
the election system and then where's the
labeling of each part fully auditable
you could be audited under some
circumstances
cannot be audited
where's that
do you feel informed if you don't know
that the single most important question
to the United States is are our
elections working
because if you get that right that's the
self-correcting part that you you fix
everything else but if you can't get a
working election
you got problems
so why on the most important question in
the country has nobody learned enough
about it that they could just stand in
front of you and say here are all the
parts of an election
this box this box this box and here's
our assessment of whether this can be
judged as a hundred percent or less than
that in credibility
If This Were a corporation
and I were the CEO and there was any
question about water taking election
Integrity I would say bring me his
PowerPoint slide
with pictures of all the parts and then
boxes pointing to them tell me if you've
got that covered or there's a
vulnerability there
and then I'd make a decision nobody's
doing that right who's doing that
just the most basic things you would do
to manage anything who's doing that
nobody right and if they did that they
would certainly want to show it to the
public because it would be the biggest
story out there
actually here all right here's my
challenge to you if you want to be
um absolutely viral
if you want to make some content that
absolutely will just be everywhere do
that
but do it well you'd have to be somebody
who knows what they're talking about
like an expert but if you're an expert
just give me one PowerPoint slide
show all the pieces of the system and
then just label them auditable or not
auditable and with whatever notes you
need that's all just do that for me
you do that for me and let other people
look at it you know who are also experts
not me and then if the experts who look
at it say yeah that looks about right
that that is what we can audit and
that's what we can't audit now what if
it what if it turned out that you could
audit all of it
because that's what my Democrat friend
says that effectively you can audit all
of it because you would notice any big
problems
and then you could look into them and
you'd find you'd find the shenanigans
Maybe
so the reason that I I'm even talking
about it is that he might be right
I might be the one who's hypnotized
that's hard to do by the way I'm trying
to model that for you
I am accepting that it's possible that
I'm hypnotized and I'm trying to find
out because one of us is
right one of us is one of us is
hypnotized or deluded or something like
that or both
and it's actually very important yeah
we're both it's very important to know
because I've talked about this in public
all the time I'd certainly like to know
if I'm completely wrong
wouldn't you
but the fact that we don't even have an
expert explaining it to us
uh
you know seems uh seems missing
all right
so if anybody has that expertise come
find me and if you've already explained
it please do it again
it was a very fine election yes
uh you think I'm under the influence not
right now
make a lesson to deprogram kids
brainwashed and yeah
I don't know that that's more of an
individual thing
um
Scott will Russia bring Nordstrom 2 back
from today's maintenance shutdowns
I don't know I mean that would start to
predict
um did you see the Chris Cuomo as
apparently uh trying to rehabilitate his
career so he went to he's in the Ukraine
I'm gonna give him credit
you know Crisco was a complicated guy
he on one hand he deserves you know a
lot of the brutal criticisms he got
and I won't I won't defend him on that
on the other hand he does have some
skills he has some skills and going to
Ukraine basically it's almost like
Penance you know it's like he's paying
Penance like can I do this dangerous
thing that nobody's doing but needs to
be done you know if I do this will you
forgive me basically and I think
I'm really in favor of redemption
now maybe it's just another another
 artist and it's not Redemption
he's just you know playing the game to
look redeemed but I don't care
I think you should be allowed to do that
even if you're you know being uh
disingenuous
if you're willing to you know do
something useful
but even if the only reason you're doing
is for your self-interest I'm on board
our whole system is designed for that
capitalism is about you doing something
that's good for you but we all get some
benefit you know if you're part of the
system
so I am uh Plus
and I will compliment him I would say
that
um Cuomo is taking on a probably an
expensive and huge physical risk
and he's doing it to rebuild and he
knows that he has to add value to the
public to do it so he's adding value
do you have a problem with that
does anybody have a problem with him
trying to redeem himself by doing
dangerous things that would add value
and you'd be happy if he did it I'm okay
with it yeah so I'm going to actually
give him a total pass
now it might be and you know
his own reasons but I don't care I don't
care what the reasons are as long as
he's really giving us useful information
so I think everybody should have that
same standard
don't you want to live in a world where
you can redeem yourself
don't you wouldn't you want that option
for yourself
wouldn't you what the Chris Cuomo option
that if yeah you gotta you gotta eat a
lot of crow you gotta you know take the
humiliation for a certain amount of time
but if you want to make the world a
better place
and that's your mechanism for recovery
please do I like that
but one of the things he's showing is
that it looks like the
ukrainians don't have enough Firepower
and they're being ground down but we did
hear a story also that Iran is looking
to sell maybe 100
armed drones to to Russia
so what does it mean if Russia is trying
to buy a military equipment from Iran
what's that tell you
anything I mean it could be just
they can you know whatever they can get
they just go and get it so it might have
nothing to do with anything except
you know the reason you rob banks is
because that's where the money is the
reason you buy uavs from Iran is because
that's where they are it could be just
that's where they are that's all there
is
um
but it feels to me like maybe Ukraine is
making a dent in their munitions
it could be that Ukraine has identified
enough of the Munitions and blown it up
that they actually are running out of
weapons and they have to get weapons
that can't be blown up in a Depot
because the uavs don't have to be stored
in a weapons Depot
or a Munitions Depot so they would be
safer from Attack
in theory the hunter is quite a lot if
they're reasonable yeah and I think
they're all reusable
um
so
here's one thing I learned about Russian
uh Logistics
apparently the way they get
new ammo to the front lines to be used
is they use trains
which apparently is sort of a backwards
way to do it so they have to put their
weapons Depots near trains because
they're actually unloaded by hand people
actually just carry the boxes of
ammunition from the train to wherever
they're going to take it onto trucks and
then trucks onto the munition base and
then for the musician based onto trucks
blah blah now Russia has two problems
one is they do a bad job of maintaining
trucks
so if you need trucks
to move your ammo around
and they do because the Munitions are
heavy and they don't go further than the
railroad area
and your trucks are breaking down you
don't have Munitions so that's one big
problem the Russians are probably having
Just Trucks not working
but the other thing is that if you have
to put your Munitions Depot near a
railroad station
we can find all of them am I wrong
if you're limited to being really close
to the the railway station
how in the world can we not find all of
them pretty quickly and that's probably
exactly what's happening because Ukraine
is blowing up one Munitions Depot after
another probably it's easy to find them
probably
they watch the Munitions being unloaded
every day
probably we've got some kind of you know
eyes in the sky that watches you know
the stuff being loaded into the Depots
I'll bet we know where every one of them
is by now
so you should be seeing entire units
being shut down pretty soon if Ukraine's
strategy is working you would see entire
parts of the Russian utility go quiet
for part of the day at least so look for
that
the first time you see that that their
artillery in one area goes quiet for
part of the day it's because they're
running out of ammo and blowing up the
Munitions Depot works and I don't know
that they have a workaround for it
I don't know that Russia could use you
know trucks or airplanes or
boats or scooters to get that Munitions
anywhere it's starting to look yeah I
mean they can use the trucks but then
they have the maintenance problem and
not enough of them and they're more
vulnerable and they travel longer
distances and the right I think the
Russian trucks are not built for
uh that much load as well so there's a
weight capacity problem
so they couldn't they couldn't have full
trunks
um
uh yeah
so
it's entirely possible that Ukraine can
keep Russia from advancing just by
killing all their ammo Depots until
Russia figures out another way and I
guess these uavs might be one of the
other ways
all right
I'm seeing a lot of uh comments that the
real problem is the Russian army is
drunk
that's not totally wrong is it
how many uh military people in the
Russian army do you think are drunk on
the job in a given day
I don't know what how many it would take
before they're completely unable to
function but
it's at least 10 percent don't you think
at least 10 percent
I don't know how much bigger but it's
probably at least 10 percent are
actually drunk during the day
Russia still hasn't used strategic
bombers I think they don't feel they
control the airspace
all right
I should stay away from the Ukraine
topic because there's too much mind
reading and sources cannot be trusted
well I I would rather give you a warning
on that because that's that's a fair
warning none of the sources for Ukraine
information are are useful
none of them but usually what I'm
talking about is is how we're thinking
about stuff and for that
the incorrect information is the right
topic because it's how we're thinking
about it if you think I'm giving you you
know some kind of military advice or
something it's not that
because I I take it as a given that we
don't know what's going on over there
would you accept that I just assume
everybody thinks that that we don't
actually know what's going on over there
and so the reports that Chris Cuomo
reports the other reports
probably are missing a lot of context I
would think
um
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
all I wanted to talk about today I
believe that you've got your money's
worth in this
I'm ignoring a lot of great questions
here's what I'll do
um I was going to turn off the YouTube
feed but I see a lot of people over
there saying that I'm missing questions
so let me do what some of you asked me
to do
uh sometimes you ask me to pause during
the topics to look at questions
um
Dean Davis says would you rather
elections have more votes and more fraud
or less votes than less fraud
why does that have to be the choice
why am I presented with a false Choice
why can't I have more votes and less
fraud
all you'd have to do is design the
system that way
uh how do you spy illegal floats the
only way to spot illegal votes is before
voting
for illegal votes that's true
yeah the only way to spot the illegal
votes would be before they get into the
system because once they're anonymized
that's it right
um
my friends take on the 12 hoaxes haven't
shown it to him but he would leave all
of them are true
uh
did your friend believe in I haven't
showed him the 12 focuses
but I can I can tell you in advance he
would think all of them are true I feel
confident in it
all right was there anything else that
you wanted to ask me
uh uh rent first wages
rents going up more than wages is that
what you want me to there's not much to
say about that
why don't we have live feeds from
Ukraine
probably lots of reasons
you know it's hard to get a good picture
of a war
because a lot of the fighting is um
sort of Over the Horizon stuff isn't it
um
NATO somebody says that NATO would lose
badly against Russia
you think that
Maybe
do you still think the Border being open
is a good thing I never thought that
you know so many people criticized me
for things they've just imagined how
many people watching this think I I'm in
favor of an open border
I mean seriously
it's one of the things I say the most
that I'm opposed to an open border
I I want the whole system changed but
but the first thing you need to change
is to control your border
right so step one control it
and then let the economist tell you who
to let in and when
but that's not open
that's so opposite in my opinion
all right um it looks like we don't have
any good questions left on YouTube
uh
see
well thank you
uh redacted news has reporters on the
ground
okay redacted news haven't heard of them
uh controlled immigration right
Poland built a wall
Kim says if we had good pictures of war
the public would want to have stopped
yeah
what kind of liberal are you
can you see my super chats I'm seeing
you uh P dub
so yes I do see it
hello I'm eunib I see you too Lex
Friedman's in Ukraine
Scott would you agree more election
security usually means less votes
uh that's the point of it isn't it
isn't the point of election security to
get rid of illegal votes
so but what's your point Dean
you're making you're making statements
of fact but I don't know what the point
is
oh on telegram there's lots of War
pictures
most of the war pictures tend to be the
aftermath like here's a dead body here's
a burnout building but you don't usually
don't see the much of the war
um
so Patrick Lancaster is another one on
the on the ground there in Ukraine
uh
uh all right it looks like we're done
with questions and ladies and gentlemen
I will talk to you later on YouTube
bye for now
