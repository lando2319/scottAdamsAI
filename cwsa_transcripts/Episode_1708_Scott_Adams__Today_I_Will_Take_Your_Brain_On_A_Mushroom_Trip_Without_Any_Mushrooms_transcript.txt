good morning everybody and what a
special morning it is better than all
the other mornings and we've had a lot
of mornings am i right
uh let's say we take
365 we'll use that as our standard
multiply by 15 billion years and the
number is anybody anybody
i know a lot of you
didn't take
higher level math so you can't do that
math in your head
like me i can't do that math in my head
either but if i could wouldn't that be
impressive
how about that that would be a show
way better than this one
but
how would you like to take it up a notch
anybody
this is the show of shows
this is the one that will
blow your freaking minds this is the
show that you will remember
forever
and to make this
uh really more of a spiritual uh journey
let's uh enjoy a copper mug our glass up
tanker jealous design a canteen jugger
flask vessel of any kind
fill it with
the beverage
that you believe will take you to the
next level i think for me that's coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day a little bit of oxytocin i wouldn't
leave that out
and it's called the simultaneous sip and
wow is it going to be good this time you
ready you ready you ready go
yeah
that was as good as i promised
maybe a little better maybe a little
better
all right um
the funniest news today
is uh there was a survey by the
economist and yougov
and
they asked which media organizations are
trusted
by democrats and also by republicans
now
we cannot trust any data
i think we've all learned that
and and of the data we can trust the
least
polls
surveys no now i'm exaggerating a little
bit
now the only thing i want to tell you is
that
i don't know if any of this data is
correct or this survey is valid
but we're going to act like it is
because that's going to be more fun
agreed
if we act like it's real
it's going to be way more fun
so here's the uh the data that uh it's
totally real
is there was a huge difference
in the democrats and the republicans in
terms of who they trusted now not in the
obvious way
obviously the democrats were trusting
cnn
more than fox obviously
you know the republicans liked you know
their breitbarts you know more than
their msnbc's right so some of that's
obvious and of course the survey
showed that exactly like you'd expect
but here's the weird part
republicans
also don't trust their own side
like it's pretty striking
so the so the republicans
definitely don't trust cnn
but do you know who else they don't
trust
fox news
newsmax breitbart
basically nothing
they basically trust nothing
who are the smart ones
let's just look at the last oh i don't
know
five years
we'll just take the last five years keep
it correct
who are the smart ones the one who
didn't trust anything or the ones who
trusted the news
like who got the better record
for the last five years
you know
i know because you know i'm setting you
up a little bit because i know the
audience
are you sure
are you sure yeah it feels like that to
me right
it feels like the people who are the
most skeptical were also the most right
with some notable exceptions
there are some things that you were
skeptical of that i still think might be
right
who knows so we don't agree on all the
skepticism but if you were just to take
a
um you know a record
with you know some hits and misses
the people who doubted everything
came out pretty well
am i wrong
but has anybody done the following thing
and could anybody is it even possible
has anybody ever taken let's let's just
say
apples to apples comparison as best you
could in this case
uh cnn to fox news
you know let's call them peers roughly
speaking that they would be peers not in
size
fox news is bigger but in type roughly
piers
now
has anybody ever made a list
of let's say again last five years
because
you know current matters more than
anything else
the last five years the number of
stories
that each of the networks got wrong
now could you even make such a list
now under the cnn list you'd have
everything from russian collusion to
blah blah
but
wouldn't you also have some things on
the fox news list
because the nature of the news business
is everybody gets stuff wrong
right
but i don't know of any case have you
heard of a case where fox news left
legitimate news out of the news
have they ever been accused of that i
haven't heard of that cnn gets accused
of that
so there are definitely some differences
going on there but
i would not judge
cnn
nor fox news or any other news by the
fact that they got some stories wrong
is that fair
can we all agree that getting some even
major stories even getting major stories
wrong
you have to kind of factor that into
that's just the news business how can
you possibly get them all right all the
time that's that's not a thing
so if you're just being reasonable you
know they're going to get some big
stories wrong no matter
what kind of resources or
intentions they put on it
but would the lists look similar
you know if you made the list and you
had some way to be objective about it
would there be you know three or four
things under the fox news list
three or four big things under the cnn
list would they look alike sort of the
same and then you'd get down to the
trivial stuff and
you know more were these the opinion
people or the news people so it would
get murky but also unimportant after the
first
five or so
and then you'd have to ask which ones
are important
you know is the jet is the jesse
smell that case
important
you know you could argue it is
but you could also argue it isn't so how
do you so if one had some big stories
that were wrong whichever side and the
other had maybe more stories that were
wrong
how could you ever compare them
you know i so i would just say that you
should
have some humility about whether or not
you can tell your own side is wrong
which is actually something that most of
you are already at
because the the big takeaway from this
data which is totally credible
is that uh
republicans are far more likely to be
skeptical of all authority
and
to me it looks like that's the right
play
more right than the other side i think
it's a mistake to be an absolutist about
it
you know if you're just going to say
everything's false
well you know i'm not going to take that
path
but
you can't criticize its track record i
don't think if you don't have data to
support it
because
anecdotally
it would look like the doubters have the
edge the last several years
uh bill maher continues to be most
valuable player
you know i think i should start giving
out the most valuable
player award for just
americans who are being useful citizens
and it would have nothing to do with you
know any of your past
so it does it's not about anything you
did up to this point but how'd you do
this week you know did he have a good
week
bill maher because he he has the ability
ability to call out his own side as well
as
what you might say is the other side i
don't know if he would say it that way
but
since he can call out people of all
groups
i think he's just doing a service that's
probably one of the most important
things happening right now in terms of
our consciousness
they're just a few people
just a few who can kind of cross over
and take the message through the bubbles
and so he's doing it again he was
apparently on overtime on his show
he was asked a question and he said he
was happy about
elon musk taking over
a stake in twitter
because he thought it'd be good for free
speech and said something i've said a
lot of you have said
that twitter is a private company
meaning that the government doesn't own
them
um
so since it's a non-government entity
they're not really bound by free speech
in the usual way
but as bill maher points out it's
functionally
the same as banning your speech if you
get banned on twitter it's like for all
practical purposes
like what's the point of having a
constitution
if you can find you know workarounds of
this magnitude it sort of makes a joke
of the constitution
so
um
i'm completely on that page
completely on that page and i would hope
most people are on that page but he's
certainly helping people to get on that
page so i give him most valuable player
award
good citizen
again forget about anything else he did
before this week because that's not part
of the mvp award
this week great citizen and he even gave
some examples
of how discussion about the wuhan lab
was banned on twitter being being the
potential source of
the pandemic
and uh
again and then bill maher also being
useful
in
helping people think
by not saying that the virus came from
the lab
saying that it we we can't rule it out
which is the only thing you can say at
this point
so again
that's like just such a useful opinion
so i said i'm going to correct myself
i'm issuing a correction correction
it's a rare thing
so make sure you pay attention when i
tell you i was wrong about something
so the college freshman who humiliated
brian stelter
at uh whatever that event was it was a
disinformation conference and then the
freshmen pointed out cnn's you know list
of disinformation
and sort of embarrassed brian stelter
and having to answer to that which he
just avoided the question
uh and i said at the time that it looked
like this
the question was written by a
professional
meaning that the student would be more
of a
setup
yeah the student was on tucker carlson
last night so that's why i'm updating my
opinion
apparently the freshman writes for the
his college newspaper
so that fact
uh that fact alone
suggests i'm going to reverse my opinion
so my opinion is that a student couldn't
have written it it was just
too well written but he has now a record
of working for the school paper
um and so i'll say oh okay
that that does suggest he has some
writing talent
and so i'm going to say
yes you are hearing my dog uh screaming
in uh some kind of urgency
and i might have to leave here to find
out what that is
if she does it again
are you okay with that
we have enough dog lovers here right if
i hear her bark again i'm gonna have to
go i think she's barking at the cat
but you'd all understand if i take a
minute to do that right
so
let me know if you hear it again
uh so here's another example of
democrats believing whatever they're
told
true or false republicans were very
early to say
it sounds to me like this black lives
matter organization
might be more about making money
than it is about helping black people
am i right
that was pretty much the republican
point of view from the start now let's
make a careful distinction because these
things get taken out of context
i don't think any i don't think any
republican was saying
uh black lives don't matter
i didn't hear that
right so nobody was disagreeing with
sort of the general idea that like
everybody should be treated as you know
equal in
in every ways that matters to black
lives matter
so
you know just the general concept that
we should all be treated uh you know as
valuable human beings everybody was on
that page
but
but now we know that the organization
itself just you know the small group of
people
whose names were attached to it
it's starting to look like a little bit
of sketchy stuff happened and what's
important about this story is it's
coming from the huffington post
so the huffington post is running
stories essentially calling out
black okay there's my dog again
i gotta go get take care of this dog
thing
i will be right back
uh
guys
yes
[Music]
i can't find her
so she either fixed her problem
if i hear it again i'm gonna have to go
take care of that again
all right
so there's
another non-story in cnn about uh don
jr's texts
to mark meadows on november 5th
um so right after the the election
and don junio was passing along some
legal strategies
for overturning the election
and
um
so cnn is treating this like it's like a
huge scandal and
there's something really important that
happened etc
let me turn on my
uh
my security cam so i can see the dog if
she's she's outdoors
she may have gotten out
oh damn it
that's what happened
open gate
that would suggest
that my dog is at the front door
where she shouldn't be
so
what what is the most reliable rule of
technology
that if you have video cameras all
around your house
and there's one that you need to look at
it'll be the one that's not working
now the camera works i look at it every
day multiple times
but because
it's
because it's important
like i really really want to see this
right now because i can't go look
and my dog might be out there because i
got that got out of the gate
it's the one thing that doesn't it's not
working all the other cameras are
working
how does that happen
i'll be back
yes
ugh
right now
oh
so
yeah one of one of the things uh
when i designed my house
i put in all kinds of uh really cool
automation
none of it ever works
almost nothing that's automated in this
house
works what it needs to it all works
sometimes
all right
um so i've got somebody uh
taking care of the dog thing
that's
should take care of itself um so the cnn
story is hilarious
because don jr is being let's say
attacked by cnn
for
doing the most normal thing that anybody
ever did
so this is what don jr is accused of
someone sent around some suggestions for
how to legally
pause the process
i guess long enough to check things out
or potential ways to have
alternate electorates or something like
that
now
given that the list was by design things
that should be legal or could you know
may be tested maybe they wouldn't stand
the legal process but they were they had
a legal theory behind them
now is it illegal to send around
somebody else's ideas
that are labeled as legal things to
consider
things to consider
and then they discard them and don't do
them
or i don't think they didn't know maybe
they did i can't remember
so
what why does don jr always get in
trouble for doing uh what all business
people do
which is
remember he got in trouble for taking a
meeting with the russian
because she might have some information
about hillary clinton
and my argument was always
that's what anybody would do
anybody who had any experience in
business at all
the first thing you'd do because it was
just downstairs
the entire effort involved in going to
the meeting was taking the elevator in
his own building it was in his own
building it was somebody he knew
like a personal connection
so who wouldn't take that meeting
because it sounded like it could be
something good
if it turned out that it was you know
that the information came from a russian
spy
then
maybe you get the fbi involved
but you're not going to call the fbi on
something that's almost certainly going
to be
who does that
i wouldn't would you
if you were almost sure that it was
really just a meeting downstairs and
somebody you knew and
you know you're just sort of humoring
them a little bit but you know maybe
maybe there could be something would you
call the fbi ahead of time
or would you find out what the
information was
and if it sounded sketchy
then call the fbi
right
uh
so every time don jr does exactly what
every smart person does in every
business setting everywhere all the time
on every topic
cnn can make it a scandal
so the most obvious thing anybody does
on any topic is take some ideas that
somebody has and spread and you know
and pass them around and then people
discard the ones that are clearly
problematic and then they maybe try one
that's the best of the bunch
like that
where's the problem exactly
yeah it's not illegal to have
bad ideas that you discard
is it
they're treating them like they were bad
ideas that they accepted
but a bad idea that you discard is an
example of somebody doing exactly what
everybody should be doing
floating up a bunch of ideas and
discarding the bad ones
that's not a problem that's a that's a
feature all right
um
so cnn's got more uh reports on
everybody does i guess about more
civilian attacks and there's some uh
intercepted audio
of apparently russian military talking
about killing the civilians
meaning that they were doing it
intentionally
now
let us do a little uh check-in with the
skeptics
how many of you would believe
a russian language audio
uh that the ukrainians have have
provided so the source is the ukrainians
so the ukrainians have given you a video
an audio that sounds like russian
speaking people
saying exactly what
you'd expect them to say
if you were ukraine and you wanted
people to know that the russians are
doing terrible war crimes
do you believe it or don't believe it
of course i i said it in a way to set
you up not to believe it right but i did
that intentionally a lot of you don't
believe it
i i would say this
i would say it's not credible
but i'm leading toward it maybe being
true but you know i wouldn't ask you to
believe it
yeah see here's the problem
the problem is that the source can't be
trusted at all
it is literally the least credible
source
of all sources
the enemy during a war
it's the least credible source the an
enemy during the war should be lying as
hard as they can the the only
requirement during war
that makes sense
is that your lies are believable or they
have an impact or they have some
military benefit
that's it
you ukraine has no obligation to tell
the truth
do you agree
do you think that ukraine under the
current situation
has some obligation to the rest of the
world to tell the truth
about what's going on i don't think so
because we're adults right
if we're adults and we see that they're
in a war
we should not believe anything that
either side says i certainly don't
believe the russian version
that would be ridiculous
but you know
skepticism is warranted now i do think
that it would be going too far to say
it's false
it would not be going too far to say you
don't know one way or the other because
the source
has no credibility
but
no matter whether this story is true or
not can we agree that atrocities
pretty much are guaranteed
pretty much because it's a war
of course there are atrocities of course
civilians are being killed of course
they're not being so careful of course
you don't need these anecdotes to tell
you what you already know that can't be
avoided that has to be true
it's a war
right mit has
decided to reinstate the sats
and i guess the acts as as
part of their requirements for getting
in
and
interestingly i wasn't aware of this but
apparently there are studies to say that
the sats the people who are not in favor
of them
they say that the only thing that they
correlate really well with is the income
of the person who took it
that they don't correlate so well with
i guess future success
and that the thing that does correlate
well is the grades you got in high
school i guess so if you got good grades
in high school you probably get good
grades in college that's fairly
predicted
but the sats are not
but mit must disagree or they just like
a brand that says you have to be this
smart to get in
so one of those two things
and what do you think does it make sense
to say that the the sat scores
correlate with family income more than
um
more than
you know future success
i i'm not sure i'm not sure i'm buying
that
i feel like all of the variables are too
bi-directional and and confounding and
stuff
i just don't know that you can suss that
out
if i had a choice of hiring somebody who
who did well on the sats versus someone
who did not
i think i'd take the one who did
now if i had both if i had their school
performance
and and the school performance was
opposite of the sats which seems kind of
rare to me
but maybe
i i think i might weight the school
performance higher because you can
imagine they had a bad day in the sats
or something
but
i don't know
s.a.t comes
i think i'd trust the sats
i do think that there might be like a 20
um
you know racism baked in and you know
anti-poor person anti-poor person in
general
uh built into the sats that seems true
but
sort of directionally i think they're
reasonably
accurate i would imagine
so uh ali alexander the uh
found i guess he was the
founder of the protest on january 6.
and he's going to talk to the
i guess the committee that's looking
into it
oh a federal grand jury subpoenaed him
and he's he's going to talk to them and
i thought it was interesting how he uh
responded
so here are some things so he he wasn't
created the safe america march on
january 6.
he denied talking with the white house
about security groups or coordinating
plans with the proud boys
so he denied that he says i don't
believe i have information that will be
useful to them but i'm cooperating as
best i can now that's kind of perfect
isn't it
like if you're in this situation this
this is just a perfect statement i don't
believe i have information that will be
useful to them but i'm cooperating as
best i can that's that's nice that's a
nice matter of fact
it doesn't provoke
it just says
just as a matter of fact that's really
good take on it
they said quote i did nothing wrong and
i am not in possession of evidence that
anyone else had plans to commit unlawful
acts okay a good clean denial
don't you like a specific and clean
denial and that that seemed like i don't
see any weaseling in that
right now i'm just talking about the
messaging i have no idea what's in
anybody's head or what actually happened
that day but in terms of messaging this
is really good
and then
then he goes on he goes quote i denounce
anyone who planned to subvert my
permitted event
a nice contrast there
subvert his permitted event
and the other permitted events of that
day on capitol grounds to stage any
counterproductive activities
again
that's really well done
yeah just in terms of communication
in public relations very clean nicely
done
but then the new york times says it's an
indication that the inquiry could reach
into the
trump administration
yeah maybe
we'll keep an eye on that and see let's
see what's up
but uh
now i promised you in the title and how
many of you stayed around for this
okay
i've got uh
we've got a weekend size group
um i'm gonna give you a
mushroom-like experience but without any
mushrooms
now everybody asks hey what's it like
when people have not done any kind of
psychedelic
s people have
it's a horrible job trying to explain it
because it defies explanation if you
could explain that in words
you wouldn't need to do it
you could just read a book about it so
it is by definition
impossible to explain
and i'm sure everybody has something
that's a little bit unique right
uh they're that their own experience is
a little bit unique
so i'm going to give you just a
little taste of something that will get
you in
sort of that mindset
a little bit
i'm going to bend your assumptions about
reality
just a little
and i'm going to start with a story
and the most provocative first sentence
of a book that could ever be
i once hypnotized a psychic
wouldn't that be a good opening line for
a book
i once hypnotized a psychic true story
now the psychic claimed to be a psychic
you know that was her claim
and the reason i did it was because
psychics are
notoriously easy to hypnotize
anecdotally don't know if there's any
signs to that and i was a trained
hypnotist and i was practicing now one
of the things that she said
once she was under hypnosis
was she explained to me that the
in the psychic realm
if there is such a thing
that the arrow of time was not one
directional
in other words she could not tell
if she was predicting something that was
going to happen or or she was telling
you something that had happened that she
couldn't know about
that those two things were identical she
could only see them
but she couldn't put a timer on
and i thought isn't that interesting now
i'm not telling you i believe in
psychics
i'm just telling you what the experience
was
and you can make your own conclusions
about this what i'm really doing is just
priming you
i'm just putting your mind in a certain
mindset
just opening up the uh
let's say your imagination
so only thing i'm going to ask for you
is that you imagine it i won't ask you
to change your mind about anything
we're just going to do some imagining
and
one of the things that mushrooms
did for me
in the one one example that i took them
and by the way i don't recommend i don't
recommend any drug for anybody right
that's that's for your doctor and you to
figure out
but one of the things you find out is
that some of your most basic assumptions
about reality
maybe not so right
and
you might not find out a better
assumption about reality because you
took a psychedelic
but you might come out of it thinking
that the impression of reality you used
to have
is not so stable
and that could actually be useful
because it means you're not locked into
whatever is bothering you
if you're if you're locked into a mental
loop
the mushrooms can just tell you you know
you don't have to be there
and maybe that's enough and then you
just lose the loop or lose that frame
so
i want to talk about a prophecy versus a
plan
prophecy means that you see something in
your mind in the future
now if you prophesize it
that just means you see it right it
doesn't mean you're doing anything about
it
now what would be the difference between
that and a plan
well a plan would be something where you
say okay i see where i'm going but i
also see that i'm going to do these
steps
and without the steps
you know that the division isn't going
to happen
right so you'd say those are very
different right there's a big difference
between just having a vision of
something
versus having a plan to get there
now a third thing that's different from
those two
is imagination
suppose you just like to imagine
yourself in the future it's not a plan
it's not a prophecy
you just like to spend time in your
imagination you know
someday oh wouldn't that be cool well
imagine if this happened
imagine if it happened now i'm going to
tell you a true story about me
from a very young age probably
teenager or so
i like to imagine something in
particular now there were a number of
things i like to imagine i like to
imagine i could fly
and i'd imagine myself flying over the
town et cetera
and i like to imagine that uh when i was
young i like to imagine that i would
become a famous cartoonist
and i would just imagine what that would
be like oh wouldn't that be great if my
job
was just like drawing cartoons and
what it what if it really worked out
i'd be thinking
now
i can't say that i had a plan exactly
and i i'm not
you it felt like a prophecy sometimes
but what i was actually doing was just
imagining it
i was just taking a pleasant thing to
imagine and then imagining it
now this is the point where i'm going to
tell you why i'm really talking about
this
some people watching this
not the majority
but some of you let's say out of 100
anyway any 100 a few of you are going to
have a profound experience
not all of you but you get to play along
as well
and the profound experience
is that you believe that there's this
big difference
between imagining something
having a vision or a prophecy whatever
word you want to put on it just seeing
it you don't know why well it's just
there
and planning to get somewhere
also
from about my teenage years
i had this cool imaginary thought
that someday
through it didn't matter how the
sequence of events happened
i would be asked to visit the president
of the united states in the oval office
and he would ask my advice on something
and
there wasn't any reason for it it was
just like a pleasant cool thing to think
of and so i've been thinking of that
since i was a teenager
now
some of you know that happened
in 2018. i was in the oval office
chatting with trump
and yeah i told you yes my opinion about
who he'd be end up running against i
said kamala harris
he said joe biden was his guess
he was a better guesser than me
so that's why i can tell you the story
i know he wouldn't mind you know that's
the one thing i could tell you because
he wouldn't mind that i told you that he
knew years in advance what was going to
happen
right i mean he called it so then that
special case i think i think i could
tell you what happened
so in
so in truth
that actually happened
now
did i do anything
um
intentionally to make that happen
i don't know
i do know that i was always interested
in politics as a hobby
i do know that i was drawn into this
live streaming stuff and i do know that
i started tweeting and
i do know that when trump came on the
scene i thought he was more interesting
than other people in the persuasion
world and it fit with what i already
knew and so i wrote about it and
one thing led to another
and there i was
literally in the oval office
it was just the damnedest thing
now
the the two examples i gave you aren't
even the only ones
i mean if they were the only ones it
would be a good enough story by itself
but consistently
i find that
things i simply imagined for fun
literally just to feel good
before i go to sleep usually it was a
trick i would do trying to fall asleep
instead of thinking of the past
and instead of thinking of the real
future like my to-do list for tomorrow
i never think about the past i never
think about the to-do list
i imagine something that would just
really be cool someday in the future
and i don't i don't try to imagine
something tomorrow
because you that's too easy to falsify
like your brain won't let you imagine
something that you think that's not
going to happen tomorrow
but if you say you know in years from
now
some years from now this cool thing
might be happening
you can you can embrace that
now here's the tip that's going to
change some of your lives you cannot
stop thinking about something
you don't have the power brains don't
work that way
you can't say stop thinking about the
elephant
don't no don't think of that elephant
stop thinking about the elephant
the more you say stop thinking about the
elephant the more you think about the
damn elephant you can't stop thinking
about things
but what you can do
is fill up your shelf space
you can fill your mind with something
pleasant
and then there's just not as much room
oh yeah the the bad thing will get in
and it'll keep chipping away it's going
to keep opening the door it's going to
keep trying to pry up the window it's
going to be trying to get in from every
angle
but hold it off if you get a strong
enough positive
imaginary this is the key imaginary
future
image that's really pleasant
you can live in it
and and and keep the cooties out you
know you can keep the monsters out and
the longer you do it
the less power the monsters have
because here's the most important thing
you need to know about a brain
what it thinks about
it thinks matters
it doesn't think about the things that
matter
what it thinks about
is what matters
if you understand that you understand
the most basic thing about the brain and
how to reprogram it that that's how a
hypnotist can reprogram you just the
basic truth
whatever i make you think about is what
matters
if you think that the things you think
about are because there are good reasons
sometimes i mean if it's a national
emergency yeah there's a good reason
but most of the stuff you think about
it's because you're thinking about it
it's not because it's important
that's the most important thing so
simply make yourself think about more
minutes of something else
because the more minutes you can make
yourself think about something else
the fewer minutes to that other thing
and it just starts to shrink
you can just shrink it shrink it shrink
or shrink it and the beauty of this is
that you can take control over your mind
and your life
because thinking about something really
cool that might happen to you in the
future
is something everybody can do
you can do it a lot you can do it all
the time you can do it while you're
stuck in line you can do it while you're
driving you can do it while you're
trying to fall asleep think of that cool
thing or several things doesn't even
have to be one thing it could be a
variety of cool things just imagine them
the more clearly you imagine them
remember the visual part of your brain
is the important part so you've got to
imagine it in in vision
don't imagine it words don't imagine it
just in sound you could add smell smells
good imagine a smell that's very
powerful but just visualize yourself
there feel the people feel the
handshakes feel the looks feel just feel
yourself in that future and that that
becomes the thing that's important
and everything else will start to fade
now if you're lucky and you thought of
something that's cool
and maybe possible
you may have discovered that you you
live in a simulation
or that
reality doesn't work exactly the way you
thought that wouldn't be a big surprise
would it
suppose you found out that reality
wasn't quite wired the way you thought
it's still mostly intact but there's
something about it you didn't know that
wouldn't be surprising would it
we find out surprising things about the
nature of reality fairly often
so here's one that's going to blow your
mind
people who take mushrooms
sometimes
not every person
but this is the sort of thing you might
understand
there's no difference
between a plan
a prophecy
and your imagination
there's no difference
and here's why
if you imagine something long enough
you end up gravitating toward the things
that make it happen
and it's unconscious
you can't tell the difference between
imagining it
and having a plan for it because in both
cases you're imagining it and in both
cases a bunch of steps happen and it
happens
you can't tell the difference
between having a prophecy
in the case that the prophecy is
something that you would also enjoy
something that you would like imagining
so when your prophecy matches what you
would like to imagine
your prophecy is going to act like an
imagination
it's going to drive you subconsciously
to do the things
learn the things associate with the
people
care about the things notice the things
that get you to the same place
these
are the same
when i teach you as i have in my book
how to fail almost everything has still
went big that a system is better than a
goal
and if this is the point where you say
but scott
you say goals are for losers you should
have a system do you know what a system
is
right there
that's the system
every day
fill up your shelf space as many times
as possible with a positive imaginary
future that's far enough away
that your brain isn't going to say
that's not going to happen tomorrow
well you know five years from now
three years from now
who knows
how do you get there
this is why i don't say have a goal
because step one might not be the thing
and maybe the goal will change and maybe
you're imagining more than one thing and
why why would you assume that one of the
things you imagine is the one you want
so imagination is more like a system it
allows you to get not just this goal but
it might turn out
that one of your other imagined goals or
imagined realities is the one
now
in the comments
how many of you
just had your mind blown
because i just told you
how to get everything you want
how to get rid of the bad thoughts how
to program the good thoughts in the
simplest possible way in a way that's
not only easy but you'll enjoy every
part of it
you'll enjoy it
and all you have to do is your
imagination
activate especially your visual sense
and the more clearly you can imagine it
and the more often you imagine it and
especially if you give yourself enough
time to get there
you're going to find that it feels like
magic
that's the problem with explaining
affirmations people ask me all the time
you say you used affirmations and you
got these you know seemingly amazing
results like how does that work
like what in the world
would writing down what you want 15
times a day while visualizing it how in
the world could that make an actual
thing happen
this is how
not only this is how
it could not happen
the mechanisms i'm explaining here you
can see for yourself i think with no
argument whatsoever
that these are functionally the same in
in my life they absolutely have acted
the same
that if i can imagine it i'm drifting
toward it
and if i don't imagine it i don't drift
toward it
and it just works every time all the
time on every topic
no exceptions
now
some of you
just lost some mental illness
not most of you
some of you
and some of you
just found a way to get everything you
want
and on that note
this being the most valuable live stream
you've ever seen
