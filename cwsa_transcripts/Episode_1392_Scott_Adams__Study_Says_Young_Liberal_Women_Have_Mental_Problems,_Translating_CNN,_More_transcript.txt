you for your service and remember the
men and women who
fell protecting our country
if you're from another place on the
globe
good morning and would you like to enjoy
this the simultaneous sip
more than you ever have before yeah it
can be done
because it is better every single time
no exceptions
and all you need is a copper margarine
glass a tanker chelsea stein a canteen
jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen right now
go
yeah yeah that's that's the stuff that's
the good stuff
uh morning stuff that's a reference from
uh
land before time one of the funniest
scenes
by will ferrell well on cnn i was
reading an article about
how the republican-led states of
texas florida georgia and some other
ones
uh have quote and this is the phrase
from cnn
have seized on former president donald
trump's
lies about the 2020 election they've
seized upon his lies
and i don't know exactly what it means
to
seize upon some lies
because it's hard to get a handful of a
lie they're kind of slippery
but apparently you can seize them and
then once you've
seized them bad things happen
and apparently the bad thing is that
these states are adopting new
restrictions
that will make it harder for some of the
residents to vote
well that sounds bad my god
why are these states making it harder
for people to vote
i i feel like i've i've heard the whole
story now
there couldn't possibly be anything that
would explain
why they're making these changes
well the reason they're making the
changes to the voting system
is because they seized on they seized on
president trump's lie you can see how
these are connected right
so you got the seizing on the lie
and that causes you to change your laws
so that fewer people can vote it's true
because it's right here in cnn oh do you
think there's another way to interpret
this
well let's go to the cnn speak
interpreter
all right calling up my app for
interpreting cnn we'll look up um
seizing on a trump lie seizing on a
trump lie
that's translated to uh improving
election integrity
all right so seizing on a trump election
lie
same thing as improving election
integrity
let's see are there other things that
are confusing let's see restrictions on
voting let's go to the translator
restrictions on voting means
restrictions on vote rigging
yeah restrictions on voting
translates into restrictions on illegal
votes
and vote rigging anything else we should
look up
how about i see them use the phrase
capital insurrection a lot let's go to
the translator
capital insurrection click click click
click capital insurrection
translates from cnn speak into a capital
protest
a protest
how about courts find no widespread
election fraud
put it in the translator courts find no
widespread election fraud
and that translates to blind man
watches no movies this year
well that's just an analogy that doesn't
help me
let me think blind man watches no movies
well
of course because he's blind
because when you're blind you can't
watch things
and if you're a court and nobody brings
you a case that you're willing to hear
well maybe you don't find any widespread
election problems
could be because there aren't any could
be
could be they didn't find any because
there aren't any it could also be
because they didn't look for any either
one of those two things would
get you the right place all right here's
some good news
have you ever noticed that when people
let's say invest in companies
or even managers at big companies they
tend to make their decisions based on
the personnel
more than the details of the proposition
so if you're high up
in management of anything if you're a
leader
you're usually depending on the person
who brings you the idea
to know if it's a good idea like you
can't independently know
what all of your underlings know so you
just depend on them
so if you've got the right people well
you got a good investment
warren buffett would tell you that they
they invest
not only in solid businesses but they
make sure that the management is solid
that's one of their top things of course
of course so if you're looking at any
problem in the world
and you're saying to yourself
um if you're saying to yourself
what's going to happen with that problem
i think you look at the personnel
involved
and that will predict pretty well and so
here's some good news
uh michael schellenberger is taking on
fentanyl addiction and homelessness
in california primarily and
let me tell you why that's good news
first of all
when if you don't know michael
shellenberger you should follow him on
twitter that's the first thing you
should do
uh if for no other reason than to boost
his voice
because what makes him different from
almost everybody really is that you
can't even detect
politics in his work i swear to god i
can't tell if he's left or right
i mean i really don't he claims he's you
know his roots are
in the left but got a little bit uh you
know red pilled by finding out some of
the green stuff wasn't really
what was what it was promoted to be
so michael sheldenberger is pretty much
a
fax first data first data always
facts always rational player
but he's also like a pit bull
so now that he's got his jaws on this
thing
uh we'll probably get a lot closer to
understanding
what works and what doesn't work with
the whole homeless situation
i'll give you just one simple example
one of the restrictions on temporary
housing
is that you can't do drugs but
so many of the people are drug addicted
that that makes the solution
completely unmatched to the problem
these are pretty basic things
and it's something that if you're
political you just can't say
because your politics says i gotta treat
it the way
other people are treating it that are on
my side and if you're on the other side
you say i have to treat it the way
my side treats it schellenberger just
goes in and says well what works
what works what makes sense and then he
just he just hammers it until you can't
ignore it anymore
so the best news you've ever heard on
homelessness
and drug addiction in
california anyway and we would imagine
that anything good that happens here
could spread
the best news you've ever heard is that
michael schellenberger decided to take a
big bite out of it and he's not letting
go so keep your eye on that and give him
a boost if he can
um rasmussen poll
ask people if biden is a stronger or
weaker
commander-in-chief what do you imagine
the results were
well surprise surprise liberals
by a strong majority think biden is a
better commander-in-chief
stronger meaning and conservatives by a
strong majority
almost the same in the other direction
say he's a weaker
one but what do the moderates say
let's talk to the moderates the
moderates
are the only ones who matter and
i'm starting to think that you could
just ignore
anybody who identifies as liberal or
identifies as conservative
because you already know what they're
going to say what would what would be
the point
of doing a poll on either liberals or
conservatives
on a question that's been in the news
for a long time
because the longer something is in the
news the more people just retreat to the
group
group think of their side now if
something is brand new
let's say anything involving the
pandemic you know that was a sort of a
new thing we didn't
we hadn't thought about it for years
already that's actually pretty useful
i do actually want to know what the
liberals and and conservatives think
because it's just a whole new
fog of war situation but
certainly with these older more
let's say questions which we've thought
about for a long time or they're just so
automatically you're going to go to your
side
like who's the better commander-in-chief
i mean really
we kind of know how that's going to turn
out right but interestingly
the moderates were a little bit closer
to split
and the moderates are the only ones who
can
make an election go one way or the other
aren't they
it seems like the moderate opinions are
the only ones that matter
and i'll even go further and say that
the extremes on both sides
probably are closer to mental illness
than political opinion
the extremes on both sides left and
right
are certainly and i feel really
confident in this opinion i don't have
to be a
a medical uh i don't have to be a mental
health professional
to have this opinion and feel pretty
confident about it
most of the people on the far left and
the far right
it's just mental problems that's all it
is
and we're acting like they're just like
everybody else you know hey
these guys are liberals and these other
people are liberals
so let's average them together what what
sense does it make to average mentally
ill people with people who are not
mentally ill
what does the average tell you nothing
doesn't tell you anything my guess is
that people who
identify as political moderates are
largely free of mental illness and that
probably identifies them more than their
political leading so it's absurd
to to look at mental illness and average
it in with political opinions
speaking of mental illness there's a new
study that came out from
somebody credible that says women are 40
more likely to develop depression than
men
i think that's this is just a little
context we'll get to the story
first of all did you know that that
women are 40 more likely to develop
depression than men
i would say sure looks like it
you know if i had to base it on my own
life experience
i'd say that might be low
it might be low i mean i certainly have
known men who are depressed
but i don't think it's even close so
that
you know it's directionally this seems
about right but i would also note
that when it comes to depression it's
something that women get
and men get it from women in other words
it does have a viral element to it you
can catch it from somebody
and i would say that the old the old the
old saying that
you know happy wife happy life is
literally true
for a man for men if your wife is not
happy you're depressed
that's it if your wife is unhappy you
are depressed
you catch it from women if you just
took you know women's depression and of
a man's life
i don't know if they would have any i
mean if they got their basic needs met
i don't know if they would be depressed
now obviously some people are
organically
genetically predisposed i'm not talking
about that group
that's that's just a pure medical
problem
but certainly there are people who are
being depressed with the you know not a
capital d
that um has to do with lifestyle and
what you're doing
so but there's more on this topic it
gets worse
apparently there is one demographic
group that is
extra extra uh suffering from
mental problems now it would be easy to
laugh about this
wouldn't it because you know comedy is
just
tragedy happening to somebody else right
it would be easy to laugh about this
except that look at these rates white
women
ages 18 to 29 who identified as liberal
were given a mental health diagnosis
from medical professionals
and they had a rate of
what 56.3 percent of them
had mental problems as compared to 28
in moderates and 27 percent in
conservatives
so for the same age group white women 18
to 29
twice as many who identify as liberals
have medically certified in medical
diagnosis
it's not self-reporting medical
diagnosis
that twice as many of them twice as many
have mental problems now are you
surprised
nope nope is there anybody who is even a
little bit surprised by that
now i think maybe the extent of it might
be a surprise
a little bit or just shocking i don't
know if it's a surprise or it's just
shocking but i feel like we thought that
right
i think most of you thought yeah yeah
you're
i'm looking at the comments now you're
not too surprised are you
and let us speculate
how this happened what was it that
caused
uh has it always been this way first of
all do you think this is a change
that we need that we didn't notice and
it snuck up on us
or is it something that's always been
true and we just figured it out
well i don't know the answer that i feel
as though
they're presenting it as if it's a
change or a trend
and i would offer the following
possible reasons for it are number one
fake news
right i'll give you a few a few other uh
possibilities
but would you agree that fake news
probably causes depression in liberals
in a way it maybe doesn't for
conservatives would you accept the first
statement
as reasonable right you know this is not
a science we're just
putting our best opinion on it
but i feel like the fake news does make
them depressed
imagine waking up and thinking that you
lived on a planet
that was going to be destroyed by
climate change
and nobody was doing anything about it
that would make a difference
because that's what the news is telling
you the news is telling you you're going
to die
don't have children they're just going
to burn up in a fireball
but if you're a conservative you look at
the news and you say
yeah i see that maybe or maybe not i
believe the
believe that it's getting warmer but
even if it is getting warmer
and even if humans are causing it we'll
figure it out
we always do we'll figure it out and by
the way
even the un says the economic impact
over 80 years won't be that big
now cnn reports it as it's really big
but if you look at the actual latest
economic projections
from the most certified
you know credible source they say maybe
a 10
difference in the gdp over 80 years
which you wouldn't notice
because the gdp will be so high by them
because just as normal increase
that if it's 10 less than it might have
been in 80 years
nobody will even know that's how small
it is
the problem is so small economically and
that's really the
the primary variable is economics
because if your economics are good you
can relocate people and you can
you know move away from the coast you
can remediate you can buy more air
conditioning you can do what you need to
do
so if you get the economics right you're
in good shape
uh or at least as good as you can be so
so part of it is fake news i believe
um then another part of it is i've heard
other people say this that we've created
a
nation of narcissists now in this case
i'm not using narcissism
in the way i've used it recently which
is a constellation of behaviors
that are way beyond just thinking you
look good but in this narrow context
i think they're talking about narcissism
as in looking at instagram and
everybody's got a better life than you
do
everybody is criticizing everybody for
everything all the time
so you worry that your self-esteem might
be part of that hey people must be
criticizing me too
i don't look as good as this instagram
model so
certainly your phone is doing some of it
certainly your mobile devices are part
of it
there's no doubt that that's something
and
then what about this i have a theory
that you can't be happy
unless your lifestyle is compatible
with biological truth
you see what danger i'm heading into
here right so pray for me
pray for me before i finish my sentences
in my observation so i'm not going to
say there's any
science behind this i'm just going to
present this as
an observation over my own lifetime and
observation over the life of other
people plus a little bit of
sprinkling in of polls i've seen in
surveys of what makes people happy so
there's a little bit of sense of science
to it but i'm not presenting it in
science
it goes like this biology says
you should be involved in the mating
process
somehow now being involved in the mating
process if you're young
might be going to school because those
people who are
improving themselves are also improving
themselves
for mating now you might think you're
improving yourself
because i know it's expected you might
think it's you're doing it for economic
reasons
you're not everything you do has a
mating
motive to it and once you realize that
the whole world is
more clear i can speak personally
that every move i've ever made
economically
was really mating it was all about
attracting a mate
when i decided on my college major i
said to myself which one of these will
look
will make me a more attractive mate yes
explicitly i said that i didn't say to
myself hmm
if i could be a lawyer that would be a
good job it matches my capabilities
nothing like that i literally said which
one will
give me better mating possibilities i
said it explicitly
it was my only motivation for anything
because i'm very tuned into my
biological truth
which is unfortunately i was born that
way
i could try to deny it i could try to
act like there's some other motive in me
but there isn't
there is no other motive it's just
mating now i can treat the mating motive
as the sub motive just for social
reasons
so i can say stuff like well i'm just
naturally
ambitious that's like c and then speak
if i tell you i'm ambitious which is
true it's just
it's an observably true statement
i'm really telling you i'm improving my
mating
brand if you will even if you're married
even if you're not looking for mates
even if mating is nowhere in your mind
even if you're not having children
even if you're never going to have
children we're still mating creatures
you can't turn it off and i'm i'm always
completely aware
that everything i do is connected to
that now on top of that
i believe that we're designed to take
care of ourselves
first and then expand our power if you
will
to taking care of you know your family
your tribe your town
your state your country the world
roughly that order
and if you're improving yourself say in
school or you're learning things at work
you're moving towards something better
which is moving toward being more of a
mating
you know opportunity even if you're not
taking the opportunity you just
you're just moving in a biologically
compatible way and i feel this society
has moved us out of that track
and then it guarantees uh mental
problems
because if you don't know why you're
doing what you're doing
and it doesn't seem to have a purpose or
reason it's not connected to anything
how could you be mentally healthy how
could you be
i've been i've been mainlining a bunch
of uh jordan peterson videos lately
let me tell you something i'll tell you
he can spin your brain around so hard
in five minutes it's just the most
amazing thing
i tried to resist watching a lot of
jordan peterson videos for
for years actually but uh
i got addicted recently got sucked in
and they are amazing they're they're
they're just amazing
but when you listen to him you can see
that he's also keyed in
in his own way i don't want to represent
his opinion but you can see that he's
quite keyed into the biological truth
of reality and if you're not if your
life
and your personality and your thinking
are not aligned with your biological
truth
you're just not going to be happy you
just don't have a chance
so i think that could be part of the
problem too
but when you look at the differences in
politics you even look at
uh trump losing the election in 2020
i feel like mental health is the biggest
part of the
that let me say that again because
that's a big statement
i believe that poor mental health
determined the election outcome
because it's the biggest factor now you
you have to have all the things that
happen
happen just the way they happen for an
election to go the way it goes right
so it's always a little bit absurd to
say here's the one reason
it's the one reason because it's all the
reasons otherwise it doesn't happen
all the reasons have to happen or you
don't get that outcome
but one that's let's say
underappreciated
is trump derangement syndrome and trump
derangement syndrome was from moment one
always serious it was always serious
meaning that when i use the phrase and
whether when others well i can't speak
for others
i'll just talk about myself when i used
the phrase trump derangement syndrome
there was no joking about that it was a
real
important phenomenon which i think more
largely could be called the
mental health it was a mental health
problem and i think that trump
represented every bully and every
problem
that many young women have suffered
what what percentage of young women have
suffered a
uh sexual abuse or whatever's in that
category some kind of me too stuff
any kind of sexual crime what percentage
of young women 18 to 29 have experienced
that
a hundred percent it's like a hundred
percent
yeah i've never heard of anybody who
hasn't i've literally
never heard of an adult woman
who has not had this experience and
usually multiple times
yeah so if you're in a category who is
getting
literally sexually abused daily
almost and then the guy running for
president
reminds you of all that because he does
right
like i'm a supporter of the president
but you can't you can't deny the fact
that his personality
the allegations against him true or
false
create it create an image of him that is
the scariest thing
a white woman between 18 and 29 could
ever see in her life
it's the scariest thing in the world and
imagine that guy becoming president
imagine somebody who had uh i'll
i'll use another situation just you so
you can imagine it better
imagine you'd been
imprisoned wrongly by some leader and
then
later that leader be ran for president
who won
and it was somebody who had imprisoned
you illegally for years and tortured you
or whatever
how would you feel it'd be the worst
feeling in the world
to watch your abuser become the leader
of the world
now in the case of trump he would be
like a proxy or a stand-in for all the
all the problems that people have had
that are real he just comes to represent
them because he
he plays into that so so strongly
so i would say mental health was the
primary reason the election went the way
it went
and we're seeing some of the outcome of
that
by biden having to resist everything
that trump did on the border
which is a disaster biden has to resist
everything that trump did in the middle
east
disaster um biden's doing a little
better and not
changing things in china but at least
he's
talking about talking about it
differently and that might not be good
all right so somehow the country got
conned into believing that poor mental
health
is the same as a political opinion and
it's not
it's not poor mental health is not a
political opinion
it just looks like it and sometimes you
can't tell the difference
uh and let me put it in this specific
way if you're worried about
imaginary risks like you wake up in the
morning
and you start worrying about imaginary
risks
while ignoring actual real ones that's a
mental health problem
but if you wake up in the morning and
you have a reasonably good sense of
what's important
what is a real danger and what is not
and then you proceed that way
you probably don't have a mental problem
at least not in that narrow context
so we've somehow bought into people
worrying about imaginary risks
can just be in the conversation too at
the very least
you should separate the people who have
imaginary problems
from the people who have real ones but
then who is the judge right
who gets to be the one who says oh these
ones are imaginary and these are real
who gets to be the judge well we don't
have too many people we can trust
in this world because politics
overwhelms everything
i would say that i try to be that person
but probably fail
because i just don't know if it's doable
i try to be the person who's not
just giving you a political opinion i
mean i try pretty hard
and you've seen me take positions on all
sides so you know that at least i can do
that
but this is why you have to look for
your your matt tybees
your glenn greenwald's your michael
schellenbergers
because these are the ones you know can
take an opposing opinion to whatever
side they're on you know they can
because they do it they do it all the
time so if you're not following
the opinions of people who you know can
take opposing opinions to their own team
on a regular basis you're just involved
in
something absurd absurd following
the the partisans only
that's just a hobby you shouldn't really
be part of the conversation
um let's talk about the fentanyl war as
you know
china is killing something like 50 to
seventy thousand americans per year
in uh drug overdoses it's
primarily fentanyl which china sends
into
mexico the cartels sent into the united
states and as you know
china knows exactly who their dealers
are because we've told them
here's the name of your dealer could you
go go pick this guy up
nope nothing happens so
in the fentanyl war that china is
winning convincingly because america is
not playing
um i looked at a list of american war
dead and so far the fentanyl war alone
is it's sort of hard to calculate it
exactly because
overdose deaths a little hard to know
exactly
why you died but if you take say 10
years times
50 to 70 000 deaths that's what it has
been or will be soon
um there are already more fentanyl war
deaths
than vietnam and more than world war one
american deaths so we're just i'm just
looking at american deaths here
but if you took the fentanyl war
casualties
and you added the covid 19 casualties so
you took all of china's effect
the fentanyl being the chemical and the
covid being the biological uh warfare
be it accidental or intentional
and if you add those together and i
think you could i mean there's a re
there's a reasonable way to do that um
you're approaching world war ii numbers
now world war ii is the biggest
war loss of life for americans
but kovit looks if you added covid and
fentanyl together
it looks like it might pass it
eventually now it will take
several years but the fentanyl war
together with the covenant war will be
the biggest
war casualties that america has ever
suffered and all of it at the hands of
china
who we still do business with
and we still negotiate with them we
treat them like oh hey how you doing
china
let's have a meeting
amazing it's amazing that we we can
walk around in that fog
one of the best things that's come out
of the last few years
and i credit trump for this and i also
predicted it in 2016. i told you trump
would
change everything about how we view
reality
and the biggest part of that i think is
discrediting the news
rightfully and discrediting experts
again rightfully uh trump is
has been the leading voice in saying
that the experts
are not to be trusted and that the news
is not to be trusted
and here we are we don't trust them
did trump succeed yeah he did he totally
succeeded
he taught us not to trust our experts
just automatically you still have to
trust experts if you don't have a better
idea
there's no other option maybe all the
experts agree
and they've agreed on it for years maybe
there are lots of studies
so there's some things you can do that
will give you some comfort
with expert advice but but believing the
experts somewhat automatically
is stupid it's just stupid you should
try to wean yourself off of that habit
there's an article in the washington
post that
tells you the the trend by alison young
and she says
quote it seems that expert consensus was
somewhat illusory now she's talking
about
the lab leak hypothesis with covet
the expert consensus was somewhat
illusory
and it would have been well to remember
that like the rest of us
scientists are prone to group think and
nine non-scientific concerns
can creep into their public statements
now here's the amazing part it's not
that you didn't know that
yeah raise your hand if you didn't know
that we all knew it
here's the weird part everybody knew it
but for some reason we had agreed to act
like we didn't
right wouldn't you say that let's say
five years ago
that everybody would know that experts
can be biased
everybody knew that 100 of people know
that experts can be biased
but we had all agreed sort of as a a
silent
unspoken agreement in society that we
would act as if it weren't true
why why was there ever a reason
to act as if the thing we all knew was
true
to act as if it's not why did we do that
it never made sense and trump i would
say
fixed that he fixed that it's probably
his greatest accomplishment
we'll never get credit for it you know
the history books will not write
that donald trump taught us to stop
blindly trusting
experts who were lying to us but he did
that
he did that right i mean you know it was
a ripple effect that started with him so
many of us were involved with it i would
say i'm part of that process as well
as as many people are but it was him
i mean i wouldn't have been doing it if
he hadn't started it it was him
and it's one of the most useful things
that's ever happened in
wait for it the history
of civilization that's right
this this mental shift that trump did
for us
stopping our trust and experts blind
trust right
you still need some trust in experts you
don't want to get rid of all of it
because sometimes you know you can you
can be a little more comfortable with
them
but i would say that trump has made the
biggest
psychological improvement improvement
in the humanities thinking
maybe one of the greatest shifts in all
of human history
and you didn't really notice it because
there was so much noise going on
we were just arguing about stuff and we
were sort of arguing about experts and
sure enough experts were wrong and sure
enough the news was wrong and
that's more hoaxes than real and you
didn't really realize the transition as
it was happening
but we're here you know it now
and you know it wouldn't have happened
without trump right
i'd like to see if people agree with
that part of my opinion
that trump was the cause that
that really launched that all
just i'm just going to read some
opinions here as they go by
the great disillusionment somebody's
calling it
i see some people agreeing yes yes yes
100
uh blah blah blah i see one now from
dale
and dale somebody named dale says no
it's really no i see
all right yeah it looks like most of you
agree with that statement
all right and then lastly
because uh it's memorial day
and because there are some stories that
are important
but should not be reported with vigor
and here's one of them there was another
mass shooting
i'm not even going to tell you the state
i mean if if you want to look into it
you can google it but i'm not going to
tell you how many people died i'm not
going to tell you where it was
i'm not going to tell you what state it
was in i'm not going to tell you what
weapons were used
i'm not going to tell you a hero stopped
it if they did i don't know
um i just i'm not going to talk about
this anymore
because every time you do it just gives
attention to the shooters and
there's nothing good that can come from
that now
i'm not ignoring it if you're saying to
me scott
it's a giant problem and you're ignoring
it no no
that's not happening i'm not ignoring
the problem
i'm just not i'm not making it worse
so by ignoring talking about it i'm
helping to
fix the problem so by ignoring it i'm
trying to be part of the productive
part of the world that's putting it back
in his place
and not persuading people that it's a
good idea to get some fame
we we saw with i think was the parkland
shooter
there are some videos that came out that
showed that he really wanted the fame
he did it for the fame now what gave him
that idea
well the fact that it's widely reported
and talked about
if you didn't widely report it and talk
about it he would have had a different
idea
maybe less dangerous i don't know
so let's uh not lose how important
these shootings are but let's not
fetishize them
let's not make them something that
somebody wants to participate in
if you do you should be lost in
obscurity and i'll help you
all right uh
yeah you know i worry about these you
hear these cases where
everybody was warned about the shooter
you know the
the police had already talked to him the
fbi was warned
i don't know if you can make that
criticism really
because it's always out of context the
context is
that the police and the fbi probably get
so many warnings
that they couldn't possibly treat them
all as serious they've got to do a
little
they got to do a little judgment on okay
this one looks like it'll blow up
maybe this one isn't such a big problem
but they don't know
they have to guess because otherwise you
can't get to the
all the work so i tend to be
more forgiving than most when i hear a
story like
the fbi talked to this person and all
the signs were there but they didn't act
because i've got a feeling the signs are
there with a lot of people
who don't act and i would imagine the
fbi knows
that it's like uh you know there'd be a
lot of people we could arrest
based on the suspicion that might happen
but you need a lot more than that
you know we still live in a free country
uh you can't be arrested because
somebody suspects you might want to
commit a crime
all right brian says you've lost trust
with every element of our justice system
well let me give you some perspective do
you believe that our justice system
is worse than any time in history
i bet not i'll bet if you had any way to
objectively rate the justice system in
the united states
and then if you had magically the same
ratings across
time all bet is better than it's ever
been
but we just might have more information
about the bad stuff
so i'm not positive but i think it's
probably better
and probably a lot better that would be
my guess my guess would be
a lot better not even close but those of
you who say it's worse
keep in mind that you're seeing non-stop
bad news
because bad news is the only news about
the justice system
if the justice system just does its job
that's not news
so the only news you're hearing is the
problems just keep that in mind i
wouldn't automatically think the justice
system is a disaster
and i would say that if you're looking
at what the the purpose of the justice
system is
is to keep society together right
if you lose our justice system the whole
thing falls apart
i think you'd agree with that right so
the justice system
is mostly about keeping the wheels on
and has it done that and has it made the
united states a place that people want
to leave their country
and live here in part because our
justice system is better
i'd say yes if i if i were to give our
entire justice system a grade i'd have
to grade it against other countries
if you grade our justice system against
some notion of perfect
it's pretty bad right because it's not
perfect
it's not it's not too close to perfect
so if that's your standard yeah it's a
mess
but if you compare it to other countries
not bad
it's not bad and if and if you look at
it at a functional level
does it make people want to come here
does it allow our commerce system to
work
efficiently because commerce requires a
judicial system
you can't do commerce unless you can sue
somebody who screws you
right nothing works unless you've got a
judiciary
so i would say our commerce system is
working great
which suggests that the foundation for
it the legal system is at least doing
a sufficient job if not spectacular
so he's henry says they threw the
january six people into solitary
confinement
yeah individual mistakes yes
there are plenty of individual mistakes
and we should not lose sight of that
the justice system is not the sort of
thing that's going to work perfectly
all day long it's the sort of thing
that's going to be breaking continually
and you just got to keep fixing it
continually which we do
the very fact that you know that that
you're aware of the fact that those
people were put in solitary which by the
way i'm not
entirely sure is true but
if there's enough transparency to put
pressure on that
at least there's some counter force and
maybe that makes a difference
um 500 people is not an individual
mistake
well i don't believe that there are 500
people in solitary confinement
and i'm not sure that anyone was for a
long time
but i'm open to it i'm not saying it
didn't happen it just feels like a
little bit
feels like a little too on the nose like
maybe
maybe it wasn't that bad but i'm open to
the fact that it might have been
all right that's all i got for now and
i'm gonna go do something else and i'll
talk to you
tomorrow
