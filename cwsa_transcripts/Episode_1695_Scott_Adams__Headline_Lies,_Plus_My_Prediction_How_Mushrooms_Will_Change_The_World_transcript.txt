good morning everybody and today will be
the most amazing and educational coffee
with scott adams of all time and
and i know what you're thinking you're
thinking that the standard has been so
high
up to now
that how could i exceed that level of
excellence well let me tell you
just when you think you've had enough
i'm going to give you another dose today
among other things i will teach you how
to smuggle a reptile
and
how magic mushrooms will change the
world
it's gonna be epic
so so good and what do you need to enjoy
it
well you need to be watching but also
you need a copper mugger glass attacker
tells us that can't you juggle last
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
have i ever mentioned i like coffee and
join me now for the un parallel pleasure
the
the dopamine hit of the day it's the
it's the thing that makes
honestly it's everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
you're here for it
wow
go
ah
yeah
yeah
well lead story today according to cnn
a man was arrested at the border
from trying to
smuggle reptiles into the united states
and some of them were endangered
now uh jose
manuel perez also known as julio
rodriguez
so he got captured and he had
60
living reptiles hidden in his clothes
authorities said 60.
so in his actual clothing
he had 60
reptiles
now the question you're asking is
is that any kind of a record
well i don't know what the actual world
record is for number of live reptiles in
your clothing
i can always speak from personal
experience
most i've ever got was 30.
i've never does anybody beat that
i've never had more than 30 live
reptiles in my clothing
at the same time but this guy got 60.
and i think that speaks well of his
professionalism
he may have figured a way to get like
you know how in a shoe box if you turn
one of the shoes backwards they fit
better you know what i mean he may have
you may have figured out something like
that with the reptiles where he's like
whoa if i take these two lizards you put
them face to face that they don't
they take up too much space but if you
turn them around
you sort of 69 the lizards if you know
what i mean
saves a little space so it could be
that the story is missed the lead
uh this isn't really so much about
smuggling reptiles as it is about
a genius
i mean do you think you could give 60
reptiles into uh your clothing
this man is a genius we should hire him
immediately
for possibly cyber
stuff
now here's the question that a lot of
you asking if you're going to put 60
reptiles in your clothing
what is the proper way to distribute
the reptiles
for the optimal reptile smuggling
situation that's why you were thinking
wasn't it
and here's here's how i would handle it
and i'm sure he handled it the same way
now you've got different sizes of
reptiles right so you've got some snakey
things they're just like you know thick
strings but you've also got some baby
alligators they said
little baby alligators and here this is
the way you'd want to distribute them
now keep in mind that if you get stopped
and you're trying to act cool it's going
to be hard
to act normal if you have 60 live
reptiles in your clothing you'd you'd
probably get a little squirmy am i right
you'd be like hi
hi officer
what do you got there nothing
nothing
why are you doing that what what am i
what am i doing
it'd be a little like that
now if you're only listening
you're missing
the best show ever
this was totally a visual gag but it
gets better and those of you on audio
i i'm so sorry for you now because what
you're about to miss
all right here's the way you do it you
take the largest lizard i believe it
would be the alligator you want the
alligator to be strategically placed to
divert attention from your otherwise
squirmy body
because if you if you've got lizards
people are going to notice
that it knows you're squirming or they
might see a little lizard action in your
in your arms or whatever
so what you do
and i might have to adjust the camera a
little bit here
um pardon my red pajamas
so this is the way i'd handle it i would
take
the alligators the baby alligators are
about this size and you put them right
down the front
right here
and then if you're stopped by anybody at
the border patrol
you use the alligator's natural emotions
as a distraction from the other
reptiles that are distributed around
your body and let me give you an example
of how this would look
excuse me sir will you stop stop right
there
and i turn to him and i say what
what
and it you know naturally he's going to
look down and let's say there are two
border patrol agents maybe they're both
female because it's funnier and one of
them says
excuse me sir do you have something in
your pants
and i'd say
no
that's rather embarrassing question
isn't it
i mean
i'm happy
feeling healthy
having a good day
but
you know nothing are you smuggling
anything in your pants no
what
smuggling something in my pants
no
um sir
can you please move along
so that's how i'd handle it
now i'm no reptile smuggling
commercial expert
but i do know a little bit about magic
tricks and if you want somebody not to
notice the other 59 reptiles you put one
alligator down your front boom
you're all good
all right so that's my first advice to
you
so elon musk asked if twitter was you
know doing a good job with free speech
of course everybody said no
and then people said
elon
you must buy twitter
and turn it into a fair thing
what do you think
should elon musk i don't i actually
don't think this is really likely to
happen
but do you think you should buy
twitter a lot of people were saying it
he it's nothing he said himself
seeing lots of yeses here's the problem
so there are a number of twitter clones
already right
don't they end up doing pretty much the
same thing
that was the problem right
there there's some types of speech that
everybody has to ban
and it ends up that you know the the
stuff that gets like protected
and not banned on the other platforms
there's such a narrow little
area of somebody telling a bad joke
basically
so
i don't know that building a competitor
works and i don't know that owning
twitter works you're still going to end
up
banning largely the same things
now one way you could avoid it
is to not have any
ads
i think that's the only way actually if
you have advertisers the advertisers
won't associate with certain kinds of
content
and therefore you can't really have a
viable platform
if you use advertisers as your income
now if you were
you know a trillionaire and you had
enough money i don't know maybe you
could build a platform
that didn't cost money
and also didn't have ads
but i doubt it
i mean
as rich as anybody is it's still going
to cost you like billions a year isn't
it
i don't know if anybody would do that
not even a richest person in the world
so i'm not sure that there's really a
play economically
business model wise to either buy
twitter
or to
try to promote a an alternative because
they just don't know that they end up
that different now the the exception
would be a subscription service
if you're in a subscription service
people tend to all be happy
because they're just buying what they
want and when they don't want it they
can immediately stop buying it
so subscription does solve everything
but here is what it doesn't solve
scale
right
but subscriptions sort of by definition
end up being a smaller universe
so you need something like a twitter
facebook meta
to reach the public if you're going to
do anything that's trying to influence a
wide bunch of people so nobody really
has a model or they would have done it
already i suppose to fix the problems
that basically everybody sees i mean
everybody sees the same problem
so here's what i suggested to in reply
to elon
and you've heard this idea but
look how well this fits um i said we
don't need a new platform we need a
supreme court of fact checking
and then i gave a few um elements to
what that would look like not a not a
complete standard
but i said first of all it should be
non-government
and then everybody who got mad at me
said stop giving the government so much
power and i said no the first thing is
non-government
government's not part of it
and then people said it's a slippery
slope until the government takes all no
i said it's a it's not government
the government's over here
and then that's separate
and then my idea would be like over here
without any of the government
and then my critics say
you can't give the government that much
power to which i say well i'm just going
to shoot myself in the head now
because i don't seem to be able to get
this message across the non-government
part
very key to the whole plan
secondly
i would like to stipulate to my critics
that if you have a good idea that you
design like a idiot
your good idea may not be successful
so i will stipulate if you did the
dumbest possible things
you would get a bad result
okay we all agree on that
can we find common ground
that if you were to simply
appoint for life
a bunch of fact checkers you would not
get a good result can we agree
and if there's somebody whose job it is
to be the
the picker of the fact-checkers
again
would we agree you're not going to get a
good result all right so can we agree
that there are a whole bunch of ways you
could definitely this thing up
in real obvious ways because if you give
anybody any kind of power that's lasting
it'll be corrupt of course
and so
some of the elements one might imagine
in a system would be full transparency
so that everybody can see everything
about it all the time
you can see the minority opinion saying
we don't agree with this this fact check
at all here's why
have you ever seen a a a fact check
with a minority opinion
have i not already made a better system
be honest
have i not already
doubled the value
of every fact check organization
simply allowing that here's their
opinion and then here's the best
minority opinion am i right
just one change
okay
now
suppose the fact checkers had
comments that could be attached to them
so that everybody could comment
um i don't think the fact checking sites
have comments do they maybe some do
can can somebody fact check my comment
about the fact checkers when i look at
fact check sites
i don't think they allow counterpoints
in in any kind of comment
field right
how about that
now that doesn't mean that people's
comments are additive but wouldn't you
like to be able to see them
because there are times when people say
hey look at this link you forgot about
this
i'd like to see that
now
i'm not saying that these specific
things i'm mentioning
are what you need but you definitely
need a very short incumbency
the person who's doing the job of
fact-checking let's say there's a group
like a supreme court of fact check
oh not part of the government
all right did anybody miss the part
about
it should be a private enterprise or
organ
let's say a non-profit
but non-government
because you can't have profit and you
can't have government those are the two
things you can't have
then you want people to do it who you
know who they are
and they're there for a short time could
be just a week
right is there any reason that you
couldn't appoint people for one week
and then maybe the next people you
appoint they might actually go back and
change the fact check because you'd want
to be able here's another thing you'd
want you'd want to have a process by
which you continually reevaluate your
old fact checks as needed and update
them
because as the composition of the fact
checkers changes
through some very transparent
process
maybe some of the old opinions get
revised
wouldn't you like to see
the record of what what they said and
why they revised it yes
to me it seems that the entire business
model of the news
could be replaced
by fact checking
the you know would you would you go to
cnn to read the news when you know it's
going to be biased basically every time
or would you go to the fact-check site
that has the news
the the main opinion and then the
minority opinion
plus the best user comments that bubbled
up
i don't know depends on the interface
right if you do a better interface
for anything
people come
good interface solves a lot of problems
so
imagine if you had full transparency
very short incumbencies some kind of a
process which i'm not i have not figured
out yet and maybe that's the killer
maybe there's no way to figure it out
but i think there is of how to select
people for very short terms to make some
fact-check decisions maybe for one week
maybe for one month
and then immediately get to new ones
because
here's a secret of contract negotiation
you ready for this
so i did contract negotiation
professionally for years
if there's some uncertainty or risk
about the deal
make it short term
that
that fixes all kinds of stuff
the problem with any kind of a deal or a
contract is that you make a bad one and
then you're stuck with it for a long
time so you can fix almost any potential
problem by saying well let's just do it
for a week
we'll make it really short so you make
the incumbency of the fact checkers
really really short
because if you go weak with a bad fact
well
it might get fixed by next week
and that would be not bad by you know
the standards of these things
so yes maybe it's a maybe it's a jury
system
we haven't fully
designed it but my only point is if you
imagine it couldn't be designed properly
i'm positively wrong about that
does anybody want to disagree
so my statement is
i'm not saying we would design it
properly
i'm saying that if you do design it
improperly it won't work but
i believe it could be designed in a way
that everybody would say yeah
it's sort of like democracy you know you
complain about everything but you're
like ah okay i get it you know there was
a process
now
my contention is this would embarrass
the other platforms
into
at least addressing the fact that the
fact jack
you know went a certain way
because could you imagine cnn ignoring a
elon musk
fact-check organization that come to the
opposite conclusion than their own news
coverage
if the fact check thing gets big enough
and gets its own attention you really
couldn't go against it could you
because you sort of have to mention it
or if you didn't everybody who saw your
story would immediately you know tweet
at you hey
the fact checkers say your story is fake
news
it would be it would be a way to
basically control
the worst excesses of all the fake news
now
having having made my case but
but acknowledging that i've not fully
designed it i've just given you elements
that seems like would have to be there
full transparency
short terms
minority opinion
user comments
so far
now you need the the
the most important process perhaps is
how you pick the people
suppose
you did it randomly
suppose people who had a certain level
of qualifications and maybe you'd say
you know
i don't know
you had to be
certain professions i don't know would
that be too discriminatory you would
want people you would want people
who other people looked at and said okay
that's a smart person
right now if it were a jury trial
i would be perfectly okay with you know
that the regular citizens making those
decisions that's a pretty good system
because a jury trial they can break down
the complexity into simple enough
that the the jury can make good
decisions
but i i think if you're trying to decide
if a
fact is true such as
global warming will destroy the world
i don't think you want
your ordinary citizens to be making the
more complicated fact check decisions do
you
well actually let me
let me inject some uncommon humility
into my live stream and say i don't
really know that do i
i kind of my bias is that you need
people of a certain level of credential
both to do a good job but also for other
people to think they're doing a good job
but maybe not
maybe you could test the system and you
find out it's just like the jury system
maybe yeah i see people disagree i
actually respect that disagreement
um i could be wrong about that it could
be that average citizens do pretty good
job on this stuff who knows maybe you
see both
maybe there'd be two systems so you can
see what the you know if you review
movies
a movie review would have the expert
opinion and then what the audiences are
saying
i find that useful don't you
that when the experts disagree with the
audience
that does tell you something
wouldn't you like to see a case where
with fact checks
the experts say it's true and the
audience says it's still not
that that would actually be useful
wouldn't it
you wouldn't know exactly who's right
but it would be useful it would tell you
what needs to be worked on or who needs
to make their argument better
all right so i think it could be done
and i also further would think that only
somebody as clever as
elon musk could figure out how to
engineer truth
oh i like how i summarize that
only somebody as clever as elon musk
could figure out how to engineer
a system that produces truth because
remember the constitution and our court
systems are that they're engineered to
produce you know government and engineer
to produce truth and justice
now they make mistakes but
you have to admit all right let me let
me give you a little thought experiment
before you had ever heard
of a jury trial
could you imagine that somebody would
have invented that process and it would
work
think about it nobody had ever invented
jury trials and somebody comes and says
i got this idea
instead of having the smartest people
decide
if people go to jail will have
these illiterate average citizens you
know at the time
uh making these life and death decisions
about other people and they barely
know anything except where their horse
shits basically and they'll make all the
important decisions and not only that
will these completely
you know random citizens make all these
decisions but here's the here's the good
part
the rest of the public will consider
that a really good system
do you think you could have sold that
system
think about it
that that that is something that if it
didn't exist you would never convince
people that would work
am i right you know i'm right
you would never be able to convince
people that system would work and
turns out it's the best one we have
so when you're looking at the uh you
know can you engineer a system that
would produce truth for
the news
a fact check
if you think that that can't be done
just have some humility because i don't
think you would have seen that i
a jury of your peers would have worked
if it didn't already exist i don't think
you would have seen it i wouldn't have
i'm not sure i would have
i don't know
i really don't know if i would have
gotten behind that if i'd never heard of
it before
and then the other thing that elon musk
could do that nobody else could do and i
think i almost mean that literally
something he could do that
maybe no one else could do and i don't
mean just the money
he could a b test it
through embarrassment
the through embarrassment part is the
superpower part
he could put up something and have it
fail
and say whoops
just say well that was that was a huge
failure
let's try this second one
whoops
total failure yeah let's try another one
and then maybe hits it on the third try
who else could do that
seriously who else could fail like like
right in front of you
and then say let's try it again we'll
tweak this
he could kanye could damn it
damn it you're right yeah kanye could do
that
but elon can do it all right so he's not
the only one oh yeah kanye could do it
all right
update on the taylor hawkins tragic
story 50 year old uh drummer for the foo
fighters
died suddenly and nobody was surprised
that today the urine toxicology test
said that he had
10 psychoactive substances in his body
including thc
tricyclic antidepressants
benzos and opioids
what would be one of the things that
would be in the category of opioids
unspecified
what would be
one unspecified specific opioid
that is sometimes known to kill people
yeah now there's no mention whether
fentanyl was involved and i'm i'm not
entirely sure they can determine can
they
i would think they could right
we may never know
um however
this also brings up a very disturbing
fact
what would be the cause of death on the
death certificate
if somebody has 10
drugs and they die of an od
what would they say on the death
certificate
and i hate the fact
that a bunch of you are going to know
the answer to this do you know why a
bunch of you are going to know the
answer to this
because you've experienced it as as have
i
so unfortunately i know the answer this
question because i had to go through it
the answer is you can't identify the one
drug that killed somebody
so there's there's some generic term
about a multiple drug
overdose so
what if
fentanyl is killing twice as many people
as we think
because that may actually be possible
don't know
but
my stepson's death was not listed as
fentanyl
that was just one thing he had
but what kills you
right is that it's not the it wasn't the
thc in his blood was it
it wasn't the beer
probably there was only one thing that
killed him but he had 10 things so the
doctors say well you never know it's you
know maybe the fentanyl so here's the
argument
you never know if the fentanyl by itself
would have been enough
but certainly you do know because of the
outcome that the fentanyl plus the other
stuff
definitely was enough
so since you can't know it was the
fentanyl you give it a generic thing
what does that mean
for our fentanyl death numbers
is there any possibility
or any any chance at all that they're
not understated
they have to be right am i wrong i'd
love to see a doctor's opinion on this
because i'm way out of my my
area but if
if these multiple drug which is very
typical by the way
and
is typically multiple drugs i think i
would think almost all the time because
people who take stuff take stuff you
know they don't stop with the one thing
so
um i don't know if that will uh come out
as a fentanyl story or not but i
wouldn't be surprised in a related story
there's a non-profit that can make
fentanyl test strips
a little piece of paper you could stick
in your drugs to find out if there's any
fentanyl in what you thought was your i
don't know
heroin or fake xanax or
cocaine or whatever
but
i don't know that that's going to get a
lot of play
you know what i mean
i don't know how many addicts
are going to waste some of their product
for the purpose of testing it
because you'd have to use up some of it
for testing right kind of expensive
so
i just don't see junkies using test
strips i like the idea it's better than
not having them but
it's a pretty small plug
well i guess it was a audit of the fbi
internal audit
and there's some report came out that's
highly redacted but it found
747 compliance errors
in 353 separate cases so about two
compliance errors per case
in uh in the category of sensitive
investigative matters so in other words
the stuff that
that's important
so there were two investigative errors
or compliance errors
on average for every case
and the bureau acknowledged the audit
findings were unacceptable
what would be the acceptable number
so 747 compliance errors
average of two per case
that's too much
what would be the right number
one per case
now if you've worked in a big
organization you might see this a little
differently
allow me to explain
if you went to any major corporation and
looked at anything that anybody's doing
in a project
how many compliance
errors would you find just in a
corporation
that has broken its own internal rules
or maybe some
statute or law let's say it's a this is
a substantial project
probably every one
yeah because we have so many rules and
regulations
and standards that you really can't do
anything important without breaking a
few
so
do you think that the fbi could even get
their job done
without
intelligently cutting some corners
yes ish
but i would imagine if you're an agent
and you're tasked with being efficient
probably the only way you can be
efficient is by ignoring the rules of
your own organization that would be very
typical
right the only way you could get
anything done in a corporation is
figuring out a way around their own
rules
literally
am i right
anybody who's worked for a big company
you know watching the comments you'll
see confirmation that yeah it's coming
already if you work in a big company
your biggest problem is figuring out how
to get around your own internal
organization
so it looks like the fbi
probably exactly the same problem as any
big organization certainly certainly the
same problems
and it looks like the fbi agents are
making the mistake of trying to do their
jobs
now that would be the friendliest
interpretation
the friendliest interpretation is
sometimes you just got to break your own
rules to get anything done doesn't mean
it's evil
but on the other hand
it's the fbi
if there's anybody who shouldn't be
breaking any rules
it would be the fbi because there's so
much at stake
so i can't give them a pass
you know nor should you
we can't say well everybody everybody's
a little sloppy you know it doesn't work
that way for the fbi so yeah they got
they got to fix that
but certainly everything we've thought
about their reliability
is being uh confirmed
well here's big news on ukraine uh you
know it seems like every day had been
like every other day
you know all the news is
russia still attacking
but now we've got some actual new news
so sean penn vowed to destroy his
academy award if zolensky isn't invited
to speak
at the oscars
so
oscars
russia ukraine war you can see why sean
penn thinks that these two things should
be paired
because what i want with my mindless
popcorn entertainment is a little bit
more war talk in the middle of a war
so good idea from sean penn to combine
those two art forms
first of all and second of all i think
that he's he's starting a trend that um
i can back
and i would i too
would like to
support sean penn
and
this is uh
this is the award i got
for outstanding cartoonist of the year
in 1997 it's called the reuben award
now this is the
like the academy awards
for cartoonists
and if zolensky doesn't get to speak
at the rubens
i will destroy this
i will destroy this
and not only that
but
i mean just look at me obviously i've
had more rewards
than one
for example
one of my best awards here very proud of
this
this was the
depay scott adams celebrity waiter
for the radisson hotel in 2009
so there were a lot of celebrity waiters
that year
and
but none none really reached the
standard
that i achieved now this award means a
lot to me my celebrity waiter award and
if we don't
immediately lower the temperature for
climate change
immediately and i'm talking in the next
month
if we don't
get the climate change fixed the next
month i'm going to destroy this
this
this will be just shards
completely destroyed i'm not done
i mean like you think that's all the
awards i've won
now i also won
the shoemate adams 2003 masters tennis
championship which was held on my tennis
court between me and one other person
now um the good news is
the worst anybody did was come in second
there were only two of us but i did
prevail
uh and i did go to the um
trophy shop and make myself an award
now that doesn't make it any less
prestigious the fact that i went and
made an award for myself some of you
will complain and say that means less it
doesn't it doesn't
now
this award
will be completely destroyed
uh if i see
any masking in public
if i see anybody with a mask in public
i'm going to take this and just go smash
it on the ground
and
i realized that i'm going to have to
accomplish a few more things to get a
few more awards because uh there's a lot
of society that needs to be fixed
and
if i can join with sean penn and destroy
my personal awards to fix the world
i feel i feel i should do that
and so
i'm with you sean let's do this
well let's talk about ukraine ukraine
won't negotiate losing any territory
what
it seems like there's not much left of
ukraine but they won't negotiate any
loss of territory that they've already
lost
those ukrainians are holding tough let
me tell you
but if ukraine won't negotiate and of
course russia won't negotiate
because they wouldn't have anybody to
negotiate with
on the territorial stuff and it's the
only thing they want
uh or you know the main thing they
um has this not become a decapitation
war
so isn't the entire war down to
can they kill zelensky
before
putin is uh
maybe taken out by his own people or
something like that
so
if nobody's willing to negotiate
does it just go on forever because the
two leaders
i mean they should both be assassinated
at this point
no i'm kidding don't don't demonetize me
nobody nobody should be assassinated
i'm just saying that i can't love either
one of them at this point i don't love
either one of them
um
so biden went overseas and only made two
blunders that i that we've heard of
uh he accidentally suggested that u.s
troops would go to ukraine which of
course would uh trigger world war three
and uh
he also seemed to call for regime change
of putin
which would
also trigger world war iii
so it was a pretty good trip pretty good
trip because he only did two things
which have a pretty good chance of
triggering triggering the entire
annihilation of civilization
civilization
but civilization had a good run and
the mainstream media is going
going sort of uh
softly on him for these things
and indeed the white house quickly
clarified
that when biden says
that uh vladimir putin must go that
really they're not
they're not talking about regime change
even though those words sound exactly
like it what they're talking about is
that he should assert less control over
his neighbors
so
if you say the sky is blue
the white house will say i think you're
misinterpreting that sky is blue comment
what he's saying is your dog has fleas
and you think to yourself
well
none of those words
like that is that's not even close
really is it
and then the white house says please
please
uh
peter ducey don't be that way peter do
you see you you need to understand that
when the president says the sky is blue
he really means if you look at the
context then your dog has fleas
and that's pretty obvious
yes you have been gaslighted by the
white house
it was just it was misspeak now of
course biden is not planning on sending
troops
and he's not planning on a
decapitation strike on putin
and even russia kind of ignored it and
said well that's sort of up to the
russian people
it was kind of
probably a good play for the russians
not to make that a big deal
because i think they want to downplay
any story about putin being in jeopardy
right
because it wasn't an interesting
response from russia ima imagine if you
will
russia imagine if you will putin calling
for the removal of biden
in ways that sound like maybe you mean
violently
that would be a pretty big story a
pretty big story
shouldn't it be a pretty big story the
other way i mean it is a pretty big
story
but
russia instead of playing it up like
maybe you think they would it's like hey
hey these guys think that taking out a
leader is good hey stop it
instead
they minimized it
they minimized it by saying that's up to
russian people you know basically they
just treated it like trash talk like it
didn't have any real world meaning
that was exactly the right way to play
that
because
do you know what the russians don't want
to be in
any kind of conversation
about removing putin
even if the even if the dominant opinion
is that you should not be removed you
don't even want to have the conversation
because you don't do you know what
matters
is it important things
is that what matter to us
no no there's no evidence that important
things matter to us what does matter to
us
well
what people tell us we should think
about
and how often we're exposed to it
what we think is important is what we're
exposed to the most that's it
that's the whole mechanism
if the only thing you were exposed to
was
some trash on the sidewalk
that would be your biggest problem in
the world
it's the only thing you're thinking
about
i mean it wouldn't change the fact that
somebody might nuke you in 10 minutes
but the only thing you're exposed to is
this trash on the sidewalk it's the
biggest problem in the world to me
so the only thing you have to do to make
something the biggest problem
is to expose people to it a lot
the last thing that russia wants
is a conversation about whether putin
should or should not be removed
do you know why
it's thinking past the sale
if you can get people to discuss whether
he should or should not be removed
you've already gotten them to agree
there was something removable in the
topic
something removable the war crimes and
indeed most people would agree with that
so imagine the russian people who don't
know what the hell is going on
suddenly finding that the news keeps
talking about whether putin
should be removed by his own people
and you're in russia and you hear that
you're like wait a minute
why is that even a national topic
i thought the war was going well
everything looks good why would the
russian people remove him he's popular
so it's pretty good persuasion
to get the russian people to yak about
how inappropriate it was for biden to
mention it
let me be
even-handed
if trump had said that
and left some ambiguity so he could say
oh i didn't mean
take out
putin and it caused everybody to talk
about removing putin
i would have called it genius
you know i would have
i would have called that genus
i think
biden
blundered into it
but russia did exactly the right thing
by minimizing
so if if biden had blundered in a way
that was an actual blunder i mean it was
a blunder to do it i think
but i don't think it was blunderus
meaning that if it had been a blunder
russia would have amplified it am i
right
if biden mentioning putin being removed
by any means
if that had not been good for the war
effort of the ukrainians
the russians would have been talking
about that like crazy hey hey hey hey
why are you talking about that
unfair hey yeah we did some bad things
but look what you're doing hey yeah okay
we bombed some civilians granted but
look what you're doing
you're trying to assassinate leaders no
no
so
it could be one of the best blunders
blind made
all right
and of course cnn is reporting that the
ukrainians are counter-attacking and
they reclaimed several
cities how true does that sound to you
are the ukrainians quote
counter-attacking
and encounter attacking to
the extent
that it should be a headline
right obviously there are
counter-attacks
i think that's obvious
but are they attacked are they
counter-attacking to such a degree
that it's important
and could change the course of the war
i don't know
who knows
but
you know we don't believe anything that
comes out of the
war zone
uh but here's what i think about
reclaimed several cities
here's how to interpret it
is there any indication that the
russians
plan to conquer and hold
and hold
every town in hamlet and city
there's no evidence of that at all
there's plenty of evidence that they
needed to fight their way from wherever
they were to wherever they were going
which probably included going through
cities and smaller ones
and you know taking out the
defenses there
so that they sort of clear the space to
move where they want to move
so in my
best guess
these so-called reclaimed cities are
ones that russia didn't want wasn't
trying to hold was just passing through
i think it's fake news
what do you think
do you think there's any chance
that uh
that there's a
a serious ukraine counter-attack that's
really like making a difference
somebody says you must be young
hey that's my line
they named no cities no you know i was
gonna say that and that i thought maybe
i read it wrong
right
because it seemed like there were
the news was saying that the ukrainians
had recaptured some cities but didn't
mention them and i thought oh i probably
read it too fast and they were mentioned
but somebody else noticed that that they
didn't mention the cities i mean that's
all you need to know right if they don't
mention the city
you know
all right
here's my most wild prediction of the
day and i feel pretty confident about
this i'm going to tell you how
mushrooms will make america dominate
china you ready for this
and i mean this
this is real
so here's something you might not be
aware of but you're pretty smart so
maybe you are
let's see
um
were you aware that only maybe two years
ago
it was impractical
to
do illegal mushrooms
and by the way
ladies and gentlemen i'm not
recommending any illegal drugs children
if you're watching this don't
go to bed immediately even though it's
mid the morning go back to bed
and don't do drugs
i'm talking about what's going to happen
not what i you know want to happen okay
2020 it was kind of impractical because
you couldn't find it easily it would be
hard to know what quantity
you would be more afraid of the legal
consequences but in the last two years
there have been huge movements toward
decriminalizing
um i suspect and i don't know this for
sure but i suspect that in california
for example if you got caught with some
small user quantity of mushrooms
that probably
basically nothing would happen to you
i think i mean i don't know that but i
think locally
it's so at least mentally
decriminalized
mentally decriminalized not technically
that i don't even know if the court
systems would
do anything
i i think they just send you home i'm
not sure
but i think in california it's basically
close to legal
just because the court system doesn't
care
i'll need a fact check on that but i'm
not sure however in 2022
um
the mushroom business has
matured
and you can now buy
chocolate bars that are metered so you
know if you take this little square
it gives you this kind of effect if you
take two of those squares
this kind of effect
now
they appear to be wide widely available
at least in california
if they're widely available
they've solved the biggest problem of
dosage so that you feel a little bit
safe i mean this is not fda approved
stuff right but you're going to feel
safer
if somebody did the work of putting it
in a nice package and
metering the doses once it becomes easy
here's what's going to happen our old
ways of looking at things are going to
just dissolve
when enough people
in a society
have had the mushroom experience again
i'm not recommending it i'm just
describing it
their
their sense of what is possible will
change and their sense of what can't be
changed
will be obliterated
obliterated
and this is going to happen in a big way
in the united states in the next few
years i'm talking about
two to five years
if you've noticed how quickly mushrooms
went from
a secret topic
to
a headline topic pretty much in all the
major media and it's even bipartisan i
mentioned this yesterday both
republicans and democrats
are working on bills to decriminalize
legalize make it make it uh medically
available etc
so it's definitely going to happen
there's no doubt about it mushrooms are
going to be really big in the united
states
will they be big in china
probably not they're not so big on drugs
are they
what's going to happen is our old frames
will dissolve it will cause a total
social re-engineering for everything
important
from school to family to work
and the
outcome of that is that the united
states will
destroy its old frames
faster
than other countries
what happens when you destroy your old
way of doing things
faster
than other countries
you dominate them
you dominate them
and i actually think and this is not a
joke
that nobody understands how big this is
uh there are a few people who do
i would love to hear an opinion from
let's say a mike cervich
i don't think he'll disagree but i'd
love to hear his opinion
people who have not had any any
experience with this realm
don't have any idea what's coming
this will be a total
rewiring of our consciousness
remember i told you that uh trump would
change everything about reality
and he did
he didn't just change politics he
changed our ability to perceive the
world objectively and we we learned that
it's just purely subjective
and that we're all living in completely
different movies and we have no idea
what's going on
right
so
i correctly predicted that years in
advance and it happened and that was a
weird prediction wasn't it i was the
only one that made it
and i'm doing it again
in this realm
there will you know and and it might
only take a
i don't know
10 or 20 percent of penetration into the
public i'm not talking about everybody
doing mushrooms i'm talking about
penetration
let me ask you this
what would happen if the rate of mental
illness in this country
was cut in half in five years
do you know
what mental health is as a cost to
society
it's through the roof
it's
it's enormous
mushrooms could probably cut that in
half in five years
think about it
that's crazy
people who have done mushrooms often
tend to go on and do amazing things i
don't know if it's a causation or
correlation
could be that people who take risks take
all kinds of risks that would make sense
but
having experienced
mushrooms when i was in my 20s just once
it's my opinion that it changes you so
fundamentally and so permanently that it
makes you more effective it actually
just makes you
able to achieve more that's what it felt
like and i think other people have had
similar experiences
and i'm seeing in the comments
um yeah just once
now other people say you know different
dosages and you know take them over time
and get different i don't know i have no
opinion about what's a proper dose of
anything
but that was my experience and other
people have had a similar experience
so
you're going to see america dominate
china and it's going to be um in large
part because the mushrooms will change
our effectiveness in a way that china
can't compete because culturally i just
don't think they're all going to be
taking mushrooms
in this country
yup
and let me tell you already
that silicon valley
i guess i could tell you this i've told
you this before
do you know why silicon valley is so
successful
lots of reasons really smart people you
know universities
nearby
once you once you get a concentration of
people then it's easier to you know get
more of those kinds of people it's all
those things
but
the people in silicon valley are not
operating under normal human
conditions
they're starting out as really capable
people and then they're finding ways to
take it to the next level
and they're they're basically brain
hacking
and it's the people who can hack
anything they can hack computers network
systems countries and now they're
working on their own brain
do you think that the smartest people in
the world who can hack anything
could collectively as they're working
together you know with this thing do you
think they can figure out how to boost
their own performance
by finding the right combination of
legal and in some cases illegal
substances
and the answer is
if you think drugs
are about junkies
well
unfortunately most of it is
but there's a small percentage of the
world who are not addicted
and are using it scientifically and in a
very calculated engineered way a b
testing
you know really doing the the research
and the testing and
talking to other people and comparing
those and stuff
and those people
are operating at just a higher level
than
that humans have ever operated at
let me say it again
if you took the smartest person
you know those smartest people
in silicon valley and let's say you
already said oh these are the smartest
you can get you know others might be
asmr but this is about as good as you
could get
and then you said all right now this
group
we're gonna say you should start
experimenting with neurotropics and
everything from
minerals to various legal and illegal
micro dosing
do you think they're doing that already
like crazy
they are doing a b testing on themselves
like crazy
are they good at it
they're good at everything
just hear that part again these are the
smartest people in silicon valley are
they good
at hacking their own brains with
chemistry and testing
they're good at everything
if there's anything you need to
understand
that collectively
this is a group of people
they don't fail collectively
individually you know companies fail etc
of course but collectively
yeah
yeah it is working
and and they will tell you that
and it makes a big difference now what's
the downside
a lot
all right a lot
don't you think that there's anybody in
silicon valley
who thought they were just being smart
who ended up you know drifting into too
much drugs and becoming addicts
of course
i mean i don't know i've never heard of
any story but i wouldn't right
and so
don't think that any of this is safe i'm
saying these are risk taking people by
nature the entrepreneurs are risk takers
and they are definitely juicing
themselves and taking themselves to a
level of human
cognition and capability
that societies probably never
experienced in the history of humankind
so there's some fun stuff ahead because
the best and the brightest
are testing their ways to new levels of
effectiveness and in a way that's the
most important story that's happening
right now you could take anything in the
world
and then look into the future and say
how is climate change
going to be addressed or remediated or
absolved
well it's probably going to be a whole
bunch of really smart people
and would you bet against at least one
of those smart people who makes an
impact
you know invent something starts the
company whatever would you bet against
one of them having had some experience
with psychedelics
i don't know the answer to this but do
you think elon musk has ever experienced
psychedelics
he's probably spoken about it does
anybody know the answer to that question
uh
i think you're guessing i see some
people saying yes but you're guessing
right i don't know that that's
ever been confirmed
but here's the thing
i feel like you could
uh it takes one to no one
you know what i mean
here's a weird thing about a psychedelic
experience
if you do it once
you can often pick people out of a crowd
who have done it
am i wrong
i mean not out of now strangers out of a
crowd but you but you could know
somebody for a while and just say
i know what you've done
am i wrong
anybody who's had the experience
yeah i'm seeing confirmation
yeah because if you think it doesn't
change you permanently
you're really wrong in the same way that
travel
changes you
uh that's the best analogy it's a bad
analogy but the best of what i can i
believe that you can pick out people
fairly easily
who are widely traveled
would you agree with that
if they if they never mention their
travels
and you just talk to somebody on some
topic for a while don't you think you
could pick out some you know not and i'm
not talking about somebody who's born in
another country and has an accent or
something i'm talking about just
somebody who doesn't have any tell
except just the way they act and talk
and think
about i'll bet you could pick out
somebody who has traveled a lot because
their their mind would be more open
and i think you could pick it out pretty
quickly
i think
now that ladies and gentlemen concludes
the amazing amazing content which we
call coffee with scott madams
i think you'll agree it's among the best
things you've ever seen in your whole
life
matched only by
possibly tomorrow
and so
i bid you do on youtube thanks for
joining
and i'm going to talk to the people on
the locals for a little bit
and uh
i'll see you tomorrow
you
