and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and Today's Show amazing
I mean I don't like to get you too fired
up for no reason but it will be amazing
and that's why I'm going to make the
locals platform
private right now because I'll tell them
some secret stuff later
well well well
um how would you like to take today's
amazing moment that you're about to
experience elevate it to the best thing
that's ever happened to anybody
everywhere in the entire history of
civilization well you'd like that and
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
a tanker cellos or Stein a canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
everything it's called the simultaneous
sip it happens now
go
and a special welcome to any club Birds
who still don't know they were the
victims of a hoax
a double hoax you got hooks by once by
4chan and Reddit
and then once by me you got double host
you're the most hoaxed group in America
double hoaxed
good for you
um here's a trivia question for you
during the time when slavery was legal
in America
named two presidents who did not own
slaves did not own slaves while it was
still legal
so prior to Abraham Lincoln
both of them were named
Adams right John Adams and John Quincy
Adams the two presidents who did not own
slaves back when it was legal in fact
John Adams famously defended a Slave
as his free attorney
yes so my cousins
have always been on the side of the
right
um
now there's a video of me that's going
around
in which I said in no uncertain terms
uh that based on opinion polls
um Rasmussen
uh about half of black Americans don't
think it's cool to be white it's just
not okay to be white
so since I've designated that to be a
hate group
black Americans a hate group
collectively not every individual
obviously anything I say about a group
you're all smart enough to know that
doesn't apply to all individuals right
you know that right
if I say that most of the presidents
until Obama or all of my guests were
white
that doesn't mean I was the president
you get that right
you can talk about groups and it doesn't
mean anything about any individual
so if I say that black Americans are a
hate group does that mean I don't like
my neighbor
who is black and a doctor
oh he's great
I love that guy that has nothing to do
with individuals I've made no comment
about individuals I love
black individuals
right so and all kinds of individuals so
as an individual I'm always going to you
know treat you as an individual whether
I want to date you have sex with you
hire you work with you talk to you it's
always going to be who the individual is
I've never had any I don't think I've
ever had any negative interactions with
any black American in my life or any
black you know any nationality but it is
nonetheless true that white people
trying to help Black America for decades
and decades has completely failed I wish
you just stopped doing it because all we
got all we got is called racists
basically there was no payoff
I I think what finally pushed me over
the edge
was finding out that the school systems
in our you know a lot of our
you know inner cities
they're graduating zero people who could
read and do math
zero
and you know as I've said before the
only strategy that works for any group
in America is focusing on education
if that's not your top Focus I don't
want to help you
let me say that as clearly as possible
if if education is not your primary
focus now I get that it's hard to do
but if it's not your primary focus I
don't want to have anything to do with
you helping you improve helping you
succeed
reparations nothing I don't even want to
have a conversation
like who who was the who is the most
notable black leader
pushing education as a way to improve
the life of black Americans who is that
person
somebody said Ben Carson maybe yeah
probably probably somebody said Bill
Bill Cosby
okay I hate the fact that that's true
I hate the fact that that's true
I think it's true that Bill Cosby was
big on education wasn't he
yeah
Tim Scott good but you know you're also
you're mentioning politicians who are
more famous just for being
you know generally politicians but but
who's the who's the black leader who
just is known as the education
person now you're mentioning a lot of
people like Thomas Soule who is
excellent
um Ben Carson Obama yeah they all say it
but it's not really a focus is it
if you tell me that any of them are
famous as making it their focus I would
say maybe famous to a very small number
of people
but there's nobody who's really you know
the brand for that
yeah Larry Elder I mean I'm sure every
every black leader has talked about
education
but it's not really talked about like a
focus is it how much did we talk about
um
George Floyd
versus education
I'm just not even close right
so anybody who doesn't focus on
education
I I don't want to help them
amount completely out but just just to
be completely clear
has nothing to do with individuals
right I love individuals of all types I
always have that that's not changing
it's just if we're going to treat groups
as groups
uh I'm going to say well here let me say
this
the LGBT group if it's sort of weird to
throw such different people in the same
group but LGBT people in America
huge success
am I right
have you ever said to yourself I don't
want to go into that gay neighborhood
because of all the of all the crime and
littering
you've never heard that
you've never heard that
nope not at all
so you know you can talk about groups
and say some things that maybe you're a
little bit useful but you know doesn't
have anything to do with individuals
all right have you been to Atlanta
all right so uh you and you know how the
world works because I said something
provocative that literally everyone
agrees with
which is if you're white
don't live in a black neighborhood it's
too dangerous
and half of the people there will think
it's not okay to be white according to
the recent poll
that would be crazy
so here predictably
a white a white man comes after me on
Twitter
and says
oh you're telling me I should get away
from my black family members
does that sound like something I would
say
that you should get away from your black
family members I'm assuming in-laws I
don't know
that's stupid
that's stupid
and then I asked him do you live in the
mostly black neighborhood
I didn't wait for the answer
because I don't have to
because the people who are going to come
after me all agree with me there's not a
single one of those white people who are
going to be you know what do you call it
signaling socially signaling they're
going to come after me to socially
signal
but they don't live in black
neighborhoods
they're taking my advice
that's all I'm saying
am I saying that you know this one
individual's probably a sister-in-law or
something like that am I saying that his
sister-in-law sister-in-law sucks
because she's black no no I don't even
know your sister-in-law don't even know
her of course not
I'll even go further
I'm not sure that black women are even
part of the question
because you know I don't see a a ton of
danger from black women
I mean you see videos of them fighting
and stuff usually it's women fighting
with other women most of the time but
and it's not it's not old black people
it's not senior citizens
it's not it's not toddlers
so it's not even about Black Americans
it's about youngish black males
for whatever reason
and I'm no longer interested in finding
out
it's a dangerous situation you should
just stay away but if any individual
young black man comes to it asks for a
job
should be fully considered with no bias
if you can manage it
so yeah don't don't discriminate against
the individuals don't do that
by helping as a group would be
ridiculous at this point
did you see the video of Biden falling
up the stairs of Air Force One
he was going up the stairs and suddenly
he goes down to all fours but fairly
quickly he got back up
now I believe that's been misinterpreted
because what I saw was it looked like
he was starting to change into a
werewolf you know how that works right
you'll be walking along and all of a
sudden
and you get onto all fours
but then I think he caught himself
because he realized he wasn't at the
entrance to the plane yet he's like oh
and then once he gets back on the jetty
back into werewolf mode I mean that's
just a guess
I wouldn't put any money on it but
that's just my interpretation I don't
know
like that's just what I saw
all right
um
Rasmussen did some polling about uh
Nikki Haley see how she would do in the
presidential race if she ran against
Biden and also how she would do in
primaries
interestingly
she would beat Biden and I had to
how about that
uh so interestingly I think I lost the
signal here for a moment
but according to erasmussen polls uh in
a three-way contest for the GOP
nomination
between Trump Haley and DeSantis now it
won't be a three-way probably but yeah
it might be toward the end as possible
um
let's see uh
52 percent of Republicans would choose
Trump if it were a three-way between
DeSantis and Nikki hilley and when I say
a three-way
I will allow you to think naughty
thoughts that's not what I intend
but once I said it I realized okay
that's what you're thinking so you're
allowed you may think naughty sexual
thoughts when I say three-way
competition
go ahead do it you know you want to
uh anyway so yeah Trump would give 52
percent in the primary
28 would say Haley and 24 would say
DeSantis
did you see that coming
now that I assume that's because the
Trump votes and the DeSantis votes are a
little bit fungible like those are the
ones that can go either way more easily
whereas the Nikki Haley votes are
probably
an anti-trump vote
does that make sense
so under that Dynamic you can see how
Haley would be slightly more than
DeSantis if it were a three-way
it doesn't mean it would be that if it
were a two-way if it were a two-way
between uh Nikki Haley and DeSantis I
think the Trump votes would go mostly to
DeSantis
I think I think it would be two to one
probably two to one DeSantis but I don't
know
because I was actually surprised by this
result
and it's also super early you know you
can't make too much of the polls at this
point all right but more interestingly
if Nikki Haley went up against Joe Biden
had to Ed in a hypothetical matchup
um according to Rasmussen
uh
45 percent of likely U.S voters would
vote for Haley and 41 for Biden
what do you think of that
does that sound legitimate
because I wonder if Nikki Haley would
pick up some of the uh
you know the person of color or woman
vote just automatically
because that's how it works right no
matter what you are you sort of pick up
that group at least some of them
automatically
and we we don't we don't typically have
Republicans running for office
who can sort of automatically get any
Democrat votes just by being who they
are it doesn't work that way
so it would be interesting to have a a
person of color uh running as a
republican speaking of which we'll talk
about uh
um ramaswamy in a bit
all right I could not be more amused or
interested and the latest Joe Rogan uh
conversation with Eric Weinstein
how many of you saw that talking about
UFOs
that was one of the most interesting
conversations it was super interesting
well I'll give you I'll give you the
part that I loved
so according to Eric there is some
governmental group
top secret governmental group
who has as long ago as three years ago I
believe started offering to Eric
and also to Sam Harris
that they could personally be taken to a
secret government facility
to see what Eric supposes might be
something in the UFO domain
but you know that the the actual topic
of what the government wants to show
them
is not disclosed so there's there's an
assumption happening here that it's
about aliens but I think that's just
short of being confirmed
now here's the funny part
apparently there have been a number of
back and forths
in which the offer was made hey we'll
take you to see this top secret stuff
and then it would fall apart
and then they'd come back oh we mean it
this time we're really going to show you
this stuff and then they say yes
and they'd be planning to do it and then
something would change and they'd delay
it
for three years
so they've never seen anything
but for three years I've been teased now
here's the funny part
Sam Harris bow down after the third one
so after the third time they said they
were going to do it they changed their
minds or they delayed Sam Harris said I
think he just called BS on it yeah
now uh Eric is still interested
and I don't know it would be hard not to
be interested because if they ever come
through and actually show them something
it'd be interesting but here's my
question to you
just on the surface you don't know
anything about the situation except what
I tell you
and here's what I'm going to tell you
of all the people on the planet Earth
that the top secret organization wanted
to show their UFOs
they chose Sam Harris in the Eric
Weinstein
can you explain that
how is that not funny just on his
surface
just and by the way I'm not making fun
of the two individuals the two
individuals I like a lot right I like
Sam Harris I like Brett Weinstein even
if I don't agree with them on different
things they're vote they're both very
serious you know American patriotic uh
you know good citizens they're good
people very smart meanwhile yeah I have
only positive thoughts about both of
them but I think it's hilarious
that the two of them entertained the
concept that they would be allowed the
secret Peak at the UFOs
well let me tell you this
do you know how a prank like the best
prank is organized do you know how to do
that
let me tell you I think I've explained
this before
the best kind of prank is the one that
wouldn't be believed by anybody except
the subject of the prank the target
so let me give you an example let's say
you had a friend who believed he or she
to be quite beautiful
but the rest of you not so much you were
thinking well maybe you think you're
beautiful
and it's good that you have a good high
opinion of yourself but maybe not
now if there were a person in your life
like that who believed they were
beautiful but objectively didn't seem
like it
a prank on that person would be
um a model agency is calling you because
although you do not have standard Beauty
you have exactly the kind of beauty
that's in Vogue and we want to make a
major a major magazine you know
pictorial love you
now what would make this a funny prank
is that nobody in the world would
believe it's true except the one who got
pranked they're the only one who thinks
that's plausible
now take this back to Sam Harris and
Brad Weinstein
uh
and by the way this prank would have
worked on me so easily right I'm glad
I'm glad it didn't happen to me but
imagine coming to me
it's the same problem right it's an ego
problem imagine coming to me some
government agency and they say Scott
you're the only person in the country we
trust to show you our UFOs
and I'd say
why why would I be that person and
they'd say well we've been listening to
you on social media and you say such
smart and unbiased things that we think
you're the best Messenger to tell the
world about it
what would I do in that situation
if that were a prank
what would I do oh I would fall for that
so hard
I I would fall through the floor for
that prank
why because it's right on the nose of
what I would want to believe
right yes sir it's sort of like it makes
me look good so of course I want to
believe it well that makes perfect sense
of all the people in the United States
they've been watching me on Twitter yes
yes that that's got to be it and and all
of my wise tweets have have finally put
me in a position where I alone can see
the secrets of the UFOs when do I buy my
plane ticket when do I buy my plane
ticket I want to go now
now
if it turns out that we have captured
alien spaceships or dead aliens or Betty
at alive in cages
and it turns out
their Erica sees them and take some
pictures and tells the world about them
then I'm wrong about everything
however this has all the Hallmarks of a
very good prank
I don't know
I don't know but if I had to if I had to
choose between we have a UFO in custody
and the two people that the government
wanted to see at first were Sam and Eric
I think I'm going to go with prank as
being a little bit more likely
there is however one other possibility
and
I can't tell you the details
but I will tell you that years ago
a person in a sensitive government
um
Department I guess you call it oh I'll
be vague I'll call it a department
in the area of the government
uh asked if I wanted to have a preview
of the government's most secret
knowledge
about a topic that I won't mention
all right so I won't mention the topic
but I was I was asked if I wanted to see
the the biggest secrets of the
government the things that you would
love to know trust me you would love to
know
and it was all
because I did say yes
and I did go look and it was all
in my opinion now that the person who
was in charge of it did not think it was
 the person in charge believed
that they had found something of value
and I listened to it and I listened to
the evidence
and I said to myself
[Laughter]
so the other possibility is that it's
not a prank on Sam Harris and Brett
Weinstein it's possible that the
government has something and they don't
know what it is
like it could be like a you know a piece
of metal that they can't identify
and and that in their minds they've
built it up to be more than it is which
is just something they can't identify
so my guess is they keep thinking they
have a UFO
and then they're going to show some
people but the more they think about it
maybe they just have a piece of metal
that they can't identify
right it might it might be just
something like that where they think
they have something but they don't
so again we're just speculating can't
read minds but I'll tell you what I
would not bet on I would not bet on we
have any captured UFOs and the
government wanted Sam Harris and Brett
Weinstein to see it first
that feels unlikely
do you know why that's unlikely
because obviously they would have asked
me to see it first
am I right
[Laughter]
all right that was sarcasm
all right um I love that story
that's so good
speaking Sam Harris
he uh he he's getting a lot of trouble
by saying something that I say
so of course I'm going to defend him on
this because he says exactly what I say
and he's getting all kinds of Internet
trouble so he's even he's even trending
Sam Harris is on Twitter today and he
quit Twitter
so so one way to trend on Twitter is to
quit Twitter
so here's what he said this is a well I
think he said this it's it's it's a
quote I didn't see it on video but it
sounds like he would have said it so I
believe it's true
uh so here's a quote from Sam Harris
during the pandemic we witnessed the
birth of a new religion of contrarianism
and conspiracy thinking the first
sacrament of which is to quote do your
own research
does that sound familiar
it goes on the problem is that very few
people are qualified to do this research
and the result is a society driven by
strongly held unfounded opinions on
everything from vaccine safety to the
war in Ukraine
agree or disagree
that's not word salad you kidding you're
in cognitive dissonance if it sounds
like word salad this is completely clear
this is very clear
all right here's why I agree with him
he did not exclude himself from the
category of people who can't do their
own research and get a good answer
right
he did not say this is a skill I have
but you don't have it
now if he had then we'd have something
to quibble with but if you say none of
us have that you know except very rarely
somebody in the field
then then I'm on board with that
completely
yeah no nobody has that skill and even
the most uh the most qualified people in
the field often don't have it
we see this all the time yeah
so
does that sound like I might have
influenced that opinion
I'm just asking because you know I've
been saying exactly this for like three
years
I've said it out loud a bunch of times
yeah it's common sense so that would be
the argument that I did not influence it
but the wording of it
feels a little Scottish so to speak
all right
um
I'm going to try to introduce a new uh
phrase to politics
I'm going to call them uh political
gooners
have you ever heard that phrase a gooner
it comes from another context
uh all right I want to see if anybody
knows what it is before I explain it
those of you who know what it is you're
revealing too much about yourselves
all right let me tell you in the uh
in the naughty world of adult
entertainment
when usually a man
is so interested in his own
self-pleasure that he takes on sort of a
zombie appearance
I would give you an impression but it
would be the biggest meme that ever
that you ever saw so I can't give you an
impression but imagine a zombie face
well the one of the hands is is busy and
you know what a gooder is like oh you
know that sort of thing
so but I feel like there's a political
gooner class
and that's the people who believe hoaxes
they're obviously not true before you
research them
now I agree with Sam Harrison nobody's
good at research even if they think they
are they're not
uh but sometimes you don't need to
research things to know it's true am I
right
let me give you an example
um if you heard a story on social media
that said that Joe Biden was an actual
cannibal
and we're just finding out and that he
eats children
every night for dinner like actual
living children kills him and eats them
would you need to research that
that's a serious question would you need
to research that
no no you don't need to research that
who would believe that
only a political guter
somebody who is so busy masturbating to
their own team that they could no longer
think in any coherent way right now let
me give you an example
that's almost like that
the gooners actually believe they
believe that the president of the United
States wants
premeditatedly
and with full intention got in front of
the country and said that neo-nazis are
fine people did you have to research
that
did he have to go and really look at the
transcript I mean I did
but not because I needed to know
is because I was trying to unprogram the
gooners
but the gooners can't hear it
because you know their hand is going
furiously and the brain is just turned
off uh my team my team okay I'm gonna
give you the meme
I'm sorry
I have to give you the meme
it goes like this oh my team my team my
team my team okay there's Your Meme have
fun with it have fun with it
I I release it to the universe
all right so how about if you heard that
a president suggested drinking bleach
as a solution to covet did you need to
research that
no you didn't you did not need to
research that
you should not have had to research that
that was clearly and obviously something
that didn't happen
and if you say oh but Scott maybe it
wasn't bleach but it was a liquid
disinfectant
no no you don't have to research whether
he thought Listerine was okay
no you don't you don't have to research
that the only people who would be
confused by that
would be those people
You couldn't possibly see this
you know on the surface and believe that
you have to look into it
you don't you don't have to look into it
all right
political guters
um
I also love the fact that the people who
believe all the Trump hoaxes
they start with the assumption that
they're smarter than Trump
and yet they fall for every hoax
it's a weird assumption if you start
with the Assumption you're smarter than
him then anything he says that isn't
what you say you say oh well it must be
racist who thinks you should drink
bleach or something no no but if you
start with the assumption that he's an
intelligent person
who might who might in some cases know
more than you do
we've seen examples of that
if you start with that assumption The
hoax just disappears
you have to assume that Trump has an IQ
of 70.
and somehow became president of the
United States anyway
and apparently that's a real belief
I've actually talked to intelligent
successful people
who believes that Trump has such a low
IQ that he only became president by
accident
just you know a weird conflation of
events that's a real opinion
how do you have that opinion
there's only one way
you're a political gooner for your team
all right this is funny speaking of
doing your own research you're all aware
that Brett Stephen Stephens Stevens
Brett Stephens from The New York Times
did a big article in which he talked
about the new study of studies that said
that masks don't work you all saw that
right so it was a big study of other
studies and a paper about other studies
wasn't exactly a Meta Meta study but it
was a sort of a review of all the
science and the the conclusion was
Master work
well
eichenwald also uh at least an ex New
York's times writer says in his tweet
the New York Times has published an
absolutely Reckless and wrong New York
Times opinion piece by Brett stefans
about a scientific paper he clearly did
not read he allows one of the authors to
state in the article quote Mass don't
work for covet 19. the paper says no
such thing in fact uh you know
so he goes on to say that the paper is
pure garbage and uh
Etc now
do you believe
that the New York Times article from
stefans that looked at all the science
about masks and found no evidence that
they help do you think do you find that
reliable
because you did your own research
do you know that a lot of the studies
were done before covid
did you know that
they were pre-covered it wasn't even
tested covet did you know a lot of the
studies were about whether you could
contract it versus whether you're gonna
you know Breathe It Out
yeah yeah we are private
basically the research was garbage
but
the research that says Mass don't work
is garbage but so is the research that
says they work
so do your own research you can find
anything you want
you can find that they work
which I've done by the way I've done my
own research and I found huge you know
very reliable evidence that mass work
I've also done my research and found
that they don't
you can find both
you can you can totally find both
how can I tell the difference the only
thing I would say for sure is that
science has not demonstrated that they
work
with any data that seems useful
if science at this point especially at
this point if they can't prove they work
well then the question of using them is
just easy
right it's already a meme yeah it's just
easy
anyway so I think we're all against
masks but this is just a emphasis for
Sam Harris's opinion that doing your own
research is absolutely useless
it's completely useless in fact there
are three things that don't work
follow the science would you agree
following the science didn't work
did it
I don't think it works for anything
anymore how about do your own research
well people who did their own research
had different answers
we know that doesn't work
how about listen to The Experts
is that working
listen to The Experts no
no
so these are three things we all thought
used to work
follow the science listen to The Experts
but also do your own research just you
know for a double check none of those
have any evidentiary value at all
none
let me tell you how to know what's true
it's the only way
can you engineer a product out of it
that's it
engineering is the only way you know if
something's true
it'll take a moment for that to settle
in just think about engineering is the
only way you know if something's true
science doesn't give you that
because science is always you know even
when it's a fact
it's still subject to revision
but if you're an engineer and you say
okay you claim you claim I can make a
satellite right your scientific claim is
if I use this science I can make a
satellite and I can communicate with
Earth and maybe do GPS well let's find
out
so I'm going to build a satellite I'm
going to put it in in the sky and see if
it tells me where I am
oh that works
it's true
that's truth
the the app is telling me from the
satellite that I'm approximately in this
room
that's truth
everything else
is tentative
everything else is just a maybe
so I think this is where we've been
fooled forever
science is not where you go to find out
what's true
engineering is
engineering tells you what's true
let's take you to Medicine
science says this pill will work
do you know how you know you got to make
the pill the only way you know is you
you put it out there and see what
happens that's engineering I mean it's
medical engineering in this case
chemistry but I'd call it engineering
right
uh not only Engineers that is a fellow
no I don't mean that only an engineer
can determine what's true I'm saying
that your way to know if something is
true is if somebody can make a product
out of it and it works the way it's
supposed to now even that isn't 100
percent
because you could engineer something
that works for the wrong reason
for example we talked about this before
um if you believe that the wing of your
airplane had to have a Bernoulli effect
in order to get lift and you built that
plane it would fly
years later you'd find out that the
Bernoulli effect had nothing to do with
it
so you can test something and engineer
it and find out it works
but then you have to fly the plane
upside down
to find out what was true
if you fly the plane upside down which
you can do and the flies that you know
the Bernoulli effect wasn't at least
wasn't necessary it might have helped
but it wasn't necessary
all right
let's talk about this Georgia grand jury
because the walls are closing in on
Trump and this time well this time they
got him let me tell you all those other
times no no those were just uh that was
just play but this time
this time they got him
and do you know what he did
he used the word find
for votes
yeah just to find this many votes
as Alan dershowitz explains last night
on I think Hannity as Alan dershowitz
explains the word
find
implies they already exist
had he used the word
invent
or possibly concoct or possibly lie or
possibly pretend or possibly cheat or
possibly do something illegal
then I would say he committed a crime
but if you ask somebody to find
something that you honestly believe
might be there either through a recount
or
potentially there's a barrel of ballots
that didn't get counted somewhere
you don't go to jail for that
you don't go to jail because you use the
word find and other people thought you
meant cheat
you don't go to jail for what other
people thought you meant
that's not a crime
it doesn't matter how many people think
you meant something it still matters
what you said
it doesn't matter what they what they
think you meant
nobody goes to jail for that nobody
the odds of trump going to jail for that
and now I heard that the Georgia or
Atlanta whoever it is the prosecutor
wants to use Rico
because there were a whole bunch of
people talking about you know what to do
to uh have the election changed
basically
is it illegal for a bunch of people to
talk about uh how to get a political
outcome
it's not illegal unless you break the
law
now that there is there is a troubling
element to this
which is the the so-called fake electors
but
even the fake electors
were operating under a legal Theory
am I wrong about that
I believe there were lawyers who said
and they were minority lawyers in the
sense that other people disagreed but I
believe there were a few lawyers who
said yeah I think we could do this and
it would you know maybe pass
constitutional muster
I don't think anybody thought it was
like
uh an insurrection
I think they thought they were trying to
get the right result
so you'd have to find somebody who
admits that they knew they lost
and they did it anyway
if you can't find anybody in this whole
Ricoh conspiracy
who didn't honestly believe that Trump
won
there's nothing
am I wrong
wouldn't you need at least one person in
this conspiracy to say yeah we knew it
wasn't real but we're you know trying to
steal the election anyway
have you heard of one person
even one
because usually you have whistled lowers
by now but as even one person said you
know you know we really didn't believe
he won we were just sort of acting like
it
now the the RICO thing is so ridiculous
and the find thing is so ridiculous and
once again
who believes
who believes
that Trump broke the law it's obvious
it's been demonstrated it's part of the
public record and he's going down
uh should I give you an impression of
the people who believe that
[Laughter]
how could you believe that
I mean seriously
how could you believe that he's a he's
in legal trouble over this
here's another one
uh CNN is still talking about
how the uh the Dominion lawsuit surfaced
all these internal Fox memos
um oh I'm not done I'm sorry I'm not
done talking about the grand jury
I forgot the best part
um so apparently this grand jury only
recommends to another grand jury
I didn't know that was a thing
am I getting that right
that the grand jury is only making a
recommendation to another grand jury
and that other grand jury would have to
indict
is that right
two grand juries for one case
oh there's an investigative grand jury
and then a regular one the indictment
grand jury I guess I didn't know how
that that worked which is good because
it means I haven't been that much legal
Jeopardy so
so here's what I think we saw the four
person who apparently identifies as a
witch
now
as I said on Twitter
if I were writing the simulation you
know this this thing you think is your
reality but it couldn't possibly be real
it's just too weird if I were writing it
and I saw that there was a Witch Hunt to
get Trump
who would I make the foreperson of that
effort to get Trump The Witch Hunt
I'd make it an actual witch
or at least somebody who identifies with
witchcraft
yeah an actual witch
and then I would have that actual witch
go on every TV show and and and talk
about the things that you're not
supposed to talk about unless you're a
witch I guess I suppose if you're a
witch they expect that
and then and then laugh and be really
really happy act really really happy
that you might send uh Trump to jail
I've never seen Trump in less legal
Jeopardy than he is right now
at this moment in time
Trump is in the least legal Jeopardy of
his entire presidency and maybe his
whole life
I mean he's been so thoroughly
researched all they could find
was a witch
to claim that the word find means
something different than than English
that was their case
so but maybe there's something with the
fake electors that they can pin on Trump
but I'd be surprised
all right um
I I feel like I just have to stop
explaining all the hoaxes because
they're so obvious at this point
here's how CNN says it
uh CNN in one of their pieces online
said uh
that the grand jury investigated former
president Trump's attempts to overturn
the 2020 election
is that the right way to cut to
characterize what happened
would you have said that Trump was
attempting to overturn the 2020 election
sort of
like you could imagine that's like
technically accurate
but it's also fake news
if you don't mention the fact that he
and half of the country believe the that
the election was not legitimate
what would you how would you describe
trying to correct
an illegitimate election now I'm not
saying it was illegitimate I'm saying
that's what the people seem to have
believed
I wouldn't call it
trying to overturn an election
I would call it trying to get a recap
I would call it trying to audit it
I would try it I would call it trying to
make sure we got the right answer
but but they're sort of Assuming he's
guilty you know they've sort of
characterized him as well they have
characterized his intentions
they've characterized his internal
intentions that have never been spoken
in this way
if his internal attention was simply to
get the right answer
which would make him happy of course uh
let's not try to reverse the election
that's trying to get the election right
CNN is so weasily
anyway
uh let's talk about uh Vivek ramaswamy
so he tweeted uh this today
he said all call president obrador
president of Mexico on day one with the
message we'll arm you to decimate the
drug cartels pumping fentanyl across our
border the cartels may be your sugar
daddy now but there's a new daddy in
town if you don't do it we'll do it for
you your choice America 2.0
now I love the energy of that
I love the energy like the vibe
I like the toughness I like their
priorities
I like I'm even going I'm now accepting
decimate as annihilate I was corrected
that apparently common use has already
elevated decimate to be equivalent to
annihilate
I thought that was sort of in the
process but it looks like dictionary.com
calls them the same
anyway
um
let's see
so here's my problem with this Americans
believe that the president of Mexico is
owned by the cartels
do you agree
how many of you would say that's a true
statement that the government of Mexico
is essentially owned by the cartels
now whether that's true or not that's
what we believe
I'm sure it's true
but even if it's not
this doesn't work
because how can Americans get behind
arming the cartels because that's what
it sounds like to me it sounds like
arming Isis because you've got some
short-term gains but in the long run
arming Isis probably a bad idea probably
a bad idea
so here's how I would
um
modify this I wouldn't even talk to the
president of Mexico except to tell them
what we're doing
now we might need to sort of pretend
there's a government in Mexico before we
do what we need to do so you know maybe
he's right with his Instinct they they
have to at least give the government a
try but I wouldn't give them weapons
that sounds like the wrong play
um
so I don't know maybe maybe he'll uh
adjust that messaging a little bit I I
would prefer uh to negotiate with the
cartels directly
and the way I would do it is I would uh
I would publish a drone picture every
day of a cartel facility
now it could be a home owned by somebody
who's known to be cartel so just here's
the facility and then you say this will
disappear tomorrow because the missile
is going to drop on it
so then you give a chance for all the
innocent people to say what
I'm in this house I work in this house
there's a missile going to drop on it
and then you run out the door and you're
safe
and then we should just continue and
never stop every day here's a new
picture
that's that's a cartel asset in 24 hours
it's going to disappear
now of course
if they had drugs and money in there
they would grab it all and they would
leave with their junks and money
that's okay
that's okay blow it up anyway
now you'll still try to you know catch
them with their money and their drugs
and kill them too but just make it a
daily occurrence here's the photo
here's the the crater the next day
here's the new photo
do whatever you want all right go nuts
you can do anything you want but this is
disappearing this won't be here tomorrow
and you just make it non-optional
non-negotiable this stuff's just going
to start disappearing
I know
maybe or Annex Mexico I would be in
favor of that as well
yes literally
in case you wonder if I'm kidding yes
I'm literally in favor of annexing
Mexico
literally in favor of annexing Mexico
yep absolutely
yeah not kidding not hedging absolutely
in favor of annexing Mexico now if they
can stop the drug
flow
and the immigration flow that no reason
to
but at the moment there there are more
let me in the United States
and we should just own it
now we could give it back you know maybe
you fix it and give it back that'd be
cool
yeah that would be good I'd love that
imagine that we take it over
put in some kind of a Effective
Government if we can we can't do it in
America but let's say we can do it there
and then turn it back you know if you
get rid of the corruption I don't know
if you could
anyway so I do like that uh that the
candidates are going to compete on
Fentanyl and so
I like Vivek ramaswamy on that topic now
I saw you prompting me in the comments
there is apparently he has some history
that he was asked to join the world
economic forum a number of times when he
was successful young entrepreneur
and even his name was on the list at one
point but he says he flatly turned them
down
and then there's a story I saw today
that when he was a young student
he got some kind of funding from a Soros
Organization for uh
uh not a scholarship but something like
a scholarship
some kind of money
now
do any of those things bother you
yeah he went to Yale law on it wasn't a
scholarship it was a
what was it
what's the word that sounds like
scholarship but isn't
I forget what the word is but I don't
really care about that a grant
Fellowship maybe it was a fellowship or
something like that yeah I don't care
about that
you know if if a student wants to take
money for an education they could take
her from Satan I don't care
I don't care at all
um you know if he then became a you know
Soros puppet I'd be worried
but if all he did is get some funding
from a grant that could have gone to any
young smart person
take take the money
no problem
so there will be lots of uh stuff coming
out about his background you should
believe maybe 40 of the tops all right
so CNN is giving major coverage to the
Ohio chemical spill this is different
right
isn't it uh
this is a change I thought Fox was sort
of covering it almost by themselves but
maybe you know the fact that Trump
visited
makes it impossible not to cover it so
now it's part of a political horse race
not just the story about one town that
CNN probably wouldn't care about but now
it's political
so Trump very wisely visited not only
because it's a you know base of support
for him
but also because uh Biden was in Ukraine
and Buddha judge is delaying for reasons
that aren't clear
so
it was a brilliant political move would
you agree
brilliant political move
and would you also agree that every time
Trump is doing something like that
he's winning
but when he's just you know griping at
DeSantis and stuff
he doesn't seem much like a leader when
he does that now he was hilarious in one
of his uh truths that made it over to
Twitter today in which he was mocking
somebody I forget but what he's just
mocking somebody he's so funny I mean
just the words he chooses are just
freaking hilarious all the time
so anyway
um
so Mike dewine the governor of Ohio said
he would stay in East Palestine
overnight until the toxic train
derailment cleanup is done
what do you think of that
so the governor went there and drank the
water in front of people and now he's
going to sleep there until it's done
now that's some good governing
that's some good governing now maybe he
should have acted sooner or differently
or something but this part
this part is strong
it's it's maybe one of the strongest
leadership moves
I can remember
because this is well you say it's
symbolic but I think it's more than that
it looks like he's leading from the
front
people like that they like it from their
leaders you know I don't even know if
dewine is Republican or Democrat what is
he this dwaran Republican or Democrat
he's a Republican
like I didn't even know that
but there's a Republican
yeah well
judge it for yourself all right
um
it's really tough to keep a narrative
going if you're CNN
show their coverage of the uh what is
going to be brutal blizzards including
la
so I think this week or today Los
Angeles is supposed to have a snowstorm
so so the articles on the home page of
CNN or you know LA to get blizzard
freezing freezing everywhere it's
freezing there's snow everywhere and
then they had to add like the fourth one
down
was it's never been this warm in
February
uh here's why that's not a good thing
that's the actual title after all the
blizzards and hurricanes and record cold
there's never been this warm in February
that's why that here's why that's not a
good thing
foreign
now
I'm not going to say that weather is
climate I get it I get it it could be
really cold one day and really warm
another day and that's not really
telling you anything right you'd have to
look at the average everywhere over time
to know anything so I'm not I'm not
saying weather is climate but it's
hilarious how CNN has to maintain their
narrative
they didn't say anything that was wrong
as far as I know I mean February might
be the warmest it's been very warm where
I am I think this is my warmest February
so I agree with them you know at least
anecdotally but it's just so hard
because they can't just say it's really
cold
you tried to cover the news you're like
well it's really cold I'm going to write
it's really cold
before you write it's really cold
we better we better frame this in the
narrative
and then you say
it's the weather report
it's just cold today I know I know I
know it's just the weather but we'd
better make sure this is in the
narrative so they did
all right CNN continues to claim the fox
Executives privately knew that the
election was fair
but they were allowing their uh on-air
people to act as though it was not
or at least act as though there was
great questions
and then I think to myself wow if that's
true that's pretty damning
and then I say to myself I can't wait to
see the quote or the text that
demonstrates this claim
still waiting
as far as I can tell this is just made
up
am I wrong
it looks totally made up
I don't believe there's any evidence
that the fox Executives knew what the
election was because it was unknowable
do you knew it was fair
and then decided oh we know we know it
was good but we're still going to run
programming this as it isn't
that's that that's what uh the CNN is
indicating but there's no evidence of
that
there's simply evidence that people
disagreed
is that a crime
is it a crime that some of the people
have had Fox thought the election was
good enough you know fair enough and
some thought it wasn't
why why is that a crime
all they showed is that they don't
they're they're not operating in
lockstep
they showed that there was and here's
the part I like best they're criticizing
Tucker Carlson
for having said that their viewers are
good people and they should respect
their preferences for what they'd like
to see covered in the news
is CNN's mocking that like you know we
caught you
caught them what
respecting Their audience behind closed
doors
behind closed doors Tucker said he
respects his audience and wants to give
them what what they quite reasonably
want to see
because Tucker does not think it's
unreasonable that people have questions
about this election
neither do I
I believe that nothing's been
demonstrated to show it was illegal I
believe that I was surprised and I
certainly wanted to see more
transparency
and all that
but I'm completely on board with people
who had enough questions that they think
is still a news story
I agree with that completely if even if
there's no evidence of anything that
went wrong with the voting the fact that
a huge portion of the public believes it
that does make a news that is news
and
respecting your audience and and giving
them the the news coverage that they
most want because it's most important
you know if the election had been
you know thrown and let's say in the
illegal way I think it was rigged in a
legal way
rigged in the sense that the rule
changes because the pandemic were
favorable to the Democrats but it was
legal right I just have to give a you
know a hand to the Democrats and say
good work you know if the Republicans
could have done something that clever
and that effective and also completely
legal
I think I would applaud them too
because you know those are the rules if
you follow the rules and you win you won
you know it looks rigged but legally if
it's legally that's something else
all right so uh keep watching the
critics of Fox News and demand that they
give you an example to represent their
opinion because there aren't any they
don't have any examples to represent
their opinion that Fox News
was lying to their customers none
at least that I've seen that I've seen
CNN
talking about Ukraine is now
seemingly I don't know I'd call it
confirmed but they're reporting
that even the head of the Wagner group
it says they don't have enough
ammunition
and it doesn't look like it's going to
get fixed
now
do I need to give you my Universal
disclaimer
Universal disclaimer any information
that you hear about Ukraine is
unreliable even if the news guarantees
you that they have no ammunition left
they might have more ammunition than
anybody's ever had in the history of War
it's possible
it's possible yeah you can't believe any
report on Ukraine
but I've been following an account for a
while that a knowledgeable you know
military veteran who knows a lot about a
lot of stuff who's going through all the
circumstantial evidence that suggests
that they're running out of barrels for
the artillery because they wear out
pretty quickly you just shoot them I
don't know for a few days and you got to
take the barrel off you can't you can't
repair it
um you can't repair it in the field it
would have to be replaced by a factory
Precision barrel and the suggestion is
that even though Russia is trying to get
ammo from all kinds of different places
if you look at the whole picture of
everything they're doing
and then you listen to the head of the
Wagner group say it directly it looks
like the round of ammunitions
like actually they're out of ammunition
like actually the war could end because
they're out of ammunition
now
I'm not going to say that that's true
yet remember it's Ukraine and it's
Russia and nothing's believable but all
of all of the signs are pointing in the
right direction they're all pointing
that direction
and we'll know I think we'll know pretty
soon we'll probably know by June I think
now Joe says wrong in capital letters
now Joe did you need to tell me
that one word wrong in capital letters
is it because you believe that I think
that I believe the news coming out of
Ukraine
is there anything I can say that would
convince you I don't believe everything
coming out of Ukraine is there any way I
could convince you that's true
so that you would stop making comments
like that
you don't need to disagree about the
quality of the information you really
don't we all get it we all get it
however for fun
I'm going to make a prediction
I believe they're out of ammo
I could be wrong and it wouldn't be that
you know I wouldn't even be surprised
wouldn't even be surprised but remember
that uh Russia is worse at everything
than you think
is that fair
so far
Russia is way worse at everything you
think they should be able to do
Am I Wrong everything literally
everything
do you think that they're manufacturing
capacity is better than you think
if it's like every other thing is way
worse than you imagine
so I don't think that they can make
enough ammo and I don't think the ammo
that they're getting is high enough
quality not to blow up in the gun and I
don't think that they can get I don't
think that they have a good pipeline of
new barrels coming into the front line
to replace the barrels that are wearing
out
I think it's over
I think it's over
I think I think at this point there's no
way Russia can win on the battlefield
uh let me acknowledge all the people who
are disagreeing in the comments
I respect your disagreement
right now when I was talking about stuff
like the uh
uh like the hoaxes
honestly I wouldn't respect your
disagreement about the hoaxes
you know I think I explained that but in
this case because we don't none of us
know and it's very complicated I totally
respect your disagreement
that you know Russia will do fine
they're they'll find them out somehow I
respect that
I disagree with it
but it's a perfectly reasonable opinion
perfectly reasonable
yeah I'm going to go with the heuristic
that Russia is worse way worse at
everything
and that that's all you need to know to
know that we're going to run out of ammo
China has stated their support
let's say you're China
and the only thing you care about is
your own interests because I think
that's fair for most countries
what is in China's best interest
to become a
a major player in the Ukraine war
or to let Russia and NATO punch
themselves out until both are weaker
what what is in China's best interest
now
I suppose maybe they could give them
ammo so that the fight goes on longer
but China's best interest I think
would be to continue buying energy and
trade with Russia
which seems fine
and not to be too directly involved in
war
because that would make the rest of
their customers unhappy
so I think China will flirt with uh
giving ammo to Russia and and here's
like a totally speculative thing
because I couldn't possibly know this
I think China is yanking Putin's chain
I I think I think China is doing to
Putin what that secret
American lab or whatever it is it was
doing to Sam Harrison and Brett
Weinstein
yeah I feel like she is like so you need
me ammo yeah lots of ammo and if we gave
you that ammo you'd be in much better
shape wouldn't you huh okay so we'll
have conversations uh internally about
giving you some ammo
and then Putin gets back next week all
right how'd that go how'd that
conversation go can we have some ammo we
are we are putting that to uh the let's
see the committee of ammo decisions in
the CCP and we'll get back to you in a
week
and Putin calls back in the week we have
it now well you know the committee on
ammo decided that they also needed an
opinion from our uh you know our
economic uh interest group and so
they're reviewing it
and Putin calls back next week and
repeat
my best guess is that she is yanking
Putin along
and he hopes that Putin will you know
end the war before they give him one
bullet because it would be a serious
mistake by China
to give Putin one bullet
we're never going to forget that
right explain why because we'll never
forget it
that's a permanent play there are lots
of things that countries do they you
know this makes me angry you shouldn't
have tested that missile when our
president was visiting but those are all
like temporary stuff right you get past
that pretty easily oh you shouldn't have
said that you know blah blah blah but if
you give our enemy
one bullet
that changes everything
that changes everything
Steve says your laugh at the end betrays
your sincerity
Steve you're a terrible mind reader
betrays my sincerity
no I laugh at uh all terrible things
the more worse it is and tragic the more
likely I will laugh
it doesn't have anything to do with my
sincerity
yeah and by the way I don't apologize
for that at all Russia is not our enemy
I agree with you in concept
but if you give them weapons that shoot
NATO people
um
you can see it both ways let's say let's
say
all right
um
what else is going on
yeah and I guess this uh Petrosian the
guy who's out of the Wagner group he's
he's directly naming names in the
Russian military who are at fault for
him not having enough
weapons now if you if you believe that
Russia has enough no weapons ammo if you
believe Russia has enough ammo you have
to explain why the guy who needs it the
most says he doesn't have it
the guy who needs it the most the Wagner
group had he says they don't have it he
showed a bunch of uh Russian soldiers of
his own men
he showed a gigantic pile a disturbing
image a huge pile
that just goes on for a long time of
dead Russian soldiers his own team
he showed that
he said it's because we don't have
enough ammo
think about that
the head of the Wagner group publicly
showed a picture of his own gigantic
pile of dead soldiers and said this is
because we're not given enough ammo
so you still think they have enough ammo
do you you think they have enough ammo
if they if if this guy did that play
no you don't do that play if you have
enough ammo or you expect to
you do that play when you know you're
not getting any ammo
now the other possibility is
Putin doesn't want the Wagner group to
win
have you ever thought of that
Putin might need this pedrosian guy to
lose
you know why because Bedrosian is I
would assume his biggest competitor to
take over
petrosians could probably kill Putin
maybe even faster than Putin can kill
him
so I've got a feeling that the last
thing Putin wants to do is make
pajogjian a huge war hero by having
enough assets
to to win whatever that looks like
winning in Ukraine it's entirely
possible Putin is playing to lose
it might be his best play
because if if Wagner and pedrosian win
the war for Putin I think pedrozian's
your new leader of Russia
or at least he's got a you know he's got
a path to it
Putin can't live with that Putin I think
would rather lose the war than win it
and make pajosian the hero of the war
because he'd have to kill him
immediately maybe that's hard
why play it all then well I don't think
that Putin expected to be in this
position I think he expected to you know
knock out Ukraine fairly quickly
nobody's a big hero because it was easy
only took us a week yeah we'll give you
a medal but that's not a big deal right
anybody could have done it it only took
us a week but once it became nearly
impossible
once it became nearly impossible
all the calculation changes and then
Putin's just trying to stay in power
staying in power means you don't have
somebody who's competitive with you for
public opinion
so this is an interesting development to
me it looks like Russia couldn't
possibly win from their current set
point
so I'll say that again this was clear
any time prior to today
if you had said yeah it could go either
way I would have agreed with you
any anytime prior to today you could I
would say it was a coin flip I don't
know could go either way
as of today
Putin has a only a losing position
I don't think he has any possibility of
of anything that looks like a whim
now it could be that we started
negotiating
before you know
the Wagner group is completely gone
we might
but I feel like Ukraine is just going to
push Russia out of all that territory
now
I didn't think that even yesterday even
yesterday I didn't believe that but as
of today I think they're going to take
it all back
because they can't
here's a comment on locals who's still
trying to figure out why Scott is so
consistently carries the Deep State's
water on this topic
you know if you were not a local
subscriber I would call you a
idiot
but I guess I am anyway
my God
I mean seriously
I look like I'm carrying the Deep
State's water
like that's that's your
that's your best opinion
on what's Happening Here
you should be embarrassed by that that's
 stupid
just stupid
and I I have to swear when I have these
situations
Joe says I'm lying for my world economic
Forum Masters at such a low level of
analysis oh you're working for Soros now
no you're an idiot oh you work for the
world economic Forum no nope you're an
idiot oh you're working for the Deep
State now nope and I hate to repeat
myself but you're a idiot right
none of that's happening
it's the lowest level of understanding
right there the lowest level
you should quit this platform you're not
qualified to be on the locals
subscription platform that's just too
 dumb honestly you should be
embarrassed about that
all right I think I made my point
um
I was quite blunt
thanks Maddie
no I'm not attacking the audience I'm
attacking the
uh
the trolls
the audience I love I I will I will pair
it
um Tucker Carlson
I actually respect my audience
you can tell right can you tell I don't
respect the ridiculous Trolls but I
respect the audience a lot yeah I think
the audience is amazing and I and I do
believe it's the smartest political
audience
if somebody can tell me who they think
is a smarter political audience
I'm interested because I'd probably
watch that content myself
but I'm not aware of any I'm not aware
of anybody who understands things better
than this group
uh
uh thoughts on Dr Shiva running for
Senate
so you know early in was it early in the
pandemic or something else I had Dr
Shiva on my live stream
so
Dr Shiva is very smart yeah
multi-discipline education Etc
um
but I don't trust him
that that's it that's my whole opinion
don't trust him
all right
um
it happened uh
I I don't remember which opinion it was
but
tweeted
yeah now he does claim to have invented
email and he has he has some backup for
that claim but you know it's sort of a
subjective opinion whether he was an
inventor or you know one of the people
who who was sort of involved in that
area at the same time
now my take is that his interest in
um publicity
is a little too high
um there's something about
the way he presents himself as raising
flags with me
that's all I don't have a I don't have
any specific accusations
by the way he uh you know he's he
criticized me on Twitter recently did
you know that so he came so Dr Shiva
came after me on Twitter for something I
believe it was probably
I think he probably fell for the 4chan
hoax or something I forget
um
uh the Viva interview with Shiva was
hard to watch yeah
I'm a Venus flytrap on Twitter
Scott is petty and that's a shame
I don't know I I'm not going to defend
myself for that
because I I like to focus on small
things and big things
so sometimes the Small Things interest
me and I focus on them I'm not going to
apologize for that
well Rama Swami do better than Yang oh
yeah much better
the trouble with Yang is he didn't fit
into any party
what uh Vivek ramaswami is doing well is
he's reading the room correctly for for
the Republican side of the world so I
think his reading of the room is
really good
so yeah he should do way better
I think it's good there's going to be
here's the problem if if Vivek ramaswamy
ends up saying things that are sort of
indistinguishable from Trump at least
policy wise not not in style but policy
wise what are you going to do
what if you add two people that look
like they had very similar
you know strong Republican approaches
both capable both smart
one is Rama Swami and one is Trump
what do you do
pick him as a VP
that would be a bold move
might be wasted as a VP
well
here's I'll just throw this into the mix
Republicans need to run a Brown
candidate
do you agree
Republicans need to run a Brown
candidate and I don't mean for Equity I
don't mean for diversity I don't mean
for signaling I mean just to get it over
with
just to get it over with it'd just be a
branding thing
like I I like that we had one black
president already
it sort of gets that you know gets that
reputation off you that you can't do
that
now there are also some things that you
can do if you're uh Brown and Republican
that others can't do
so Tim Scott would have the same benefit
if Rama uh yeah if Vivek ramaswamy
decided to press a war in Mexico would
anybody call him a racist
now
what if Trump does it if Trump starts a
war in Mexico against the cartels
day one oh he always attacks the brown
people doesn't he right so they could
have identical policies but one can do
it without political blowback of that
type and one can do it with all that
blow Buck of exactly that type so if
Trump is your president and you're a
Republican
he will give you one more reason to be
called a racist even though you didn't
do anything
and it's not his fault because in this
scenario Trump would be doing what
Republicans want which is getting tough
on the cartels
but the Democrats would still say well
that's racist but you could take that
away from them
by having a brown president who just
does what makes sense and then people go
oh well let's just talk about whether it
makes sense because it takes away their
go-to
yeah they call Candace Owens a white
supremacist but but it sounds ridiculous
it looks ridiculous
so
um Vivek has some real advantages he's
got youth he's got you know business
experience I like that he's an outsider
he's smart enough seems to have the
right passion the right energy
uh there's a lot right about him there's
a lot right about him
I could easily imagine supporting him
I'm not there yet but I could easily
imagine
foreign
that ladies and gentlemen is the best
live stream you've ever seen
ever
and I'm going to say goodbye to the
YouTube people thanks for joining
