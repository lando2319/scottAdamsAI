hey everybody come on in come on in
it's time it's time for coffee with
scott adams
the best part of your entire day
yeah but that's only so far
because you get the kick off with a
simultaneous hip
and then it just keeps getting better
all day long until the next simultaneous
set but then bam you're right back at it
everything's trending the right way
again now it has come to my attention
that some of you fast forward past the
simultaneous zip
well you can do that but you're missing
the good stuff
it's the part where everybody comes
together
in this moment of solidarity there is no
violence
there is no ugliness in the world during
the simultaneous sip
and all you need all you need is a
copper
glass a tanker challenger steiner
canteen joker flask
a vessel of any kind
i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
i can feel the fatality rate dropping
even as the coronavirus
increases coffee what can't it do
somebody sent me this mug in the mail
didn't have a name on it
there will be cursing there will
probably not be cursing today
i try to warn you when it's going to
happen sometimes i can't always control
it
sometimes it just comes out
well i'm having a terrific time watching
the rasmussen reports
uh dunking on its competition
and it's pretty funny if you're not
following him so you should follow the
twitter account of rasmussen
reports and it's pretty hilarious what
they do to their competitors
so wouldn't you expect that since
everybody knows there's going to be a
bounce
after a convention that as soon as the
convention is done
you'd have lots of polls because there
are lots of polling places
so you'd sort of expect
given that everybody would be hyper
interested in
polling immediately after a convention
so there would be a lot of polls
wouldn't there but as rasmussen points
out there are a few that haven't weighed
in
it's been quite a while
among the ones that haven't weighed in
are
let's see as of the 28th anyway fox news
cnn abc washington post nbc was
at wall street journal npr marist new
york times sienna usa today suffolk
monmouth
and quinnipic huh and
as rasmussen points out there is a
big coincidence in how they seem to be
the favored polls by the democrats in
fact
the very same polls that the democrats
used to determine if somebody had polled
well enough to be in a debate
isn't that a coincidence
there is a big coronavirus flare up in
europe
i'm sure you've heard of it because it's
it's all over the news
if you open up cnn obviously
and i'll do this right now to
demonstrate i go to the cnn home page
and we'll look for the story about the
big
flare-up of coronavirus in europe
because you know
i'd heard that europe was doing really
well compared to the united states
so it would be pretty big news if there
was a major
flare-up in europe so i'll go to cnn to
check
the major news um okay it's not the top
story but
obviously it's one of the top stories so
i'll just keep reading down
it's not it's not the second or third
story
huh it's actually not on their page
but they do have an excellent story
about a man
who built a a bar for the squirrels in
his backyard
it's a nut bar and
it's not some would say it's not the
biggest story in the news
but it was good enough to make the home
page of cnn
so yeah there's a there's a man who
built a nut bar
that dispenses nuts to the squirrels
what what about the coronavirus in
europe can't be important
i don't know but i did find an article
not on cnn they said that there's
something curious about this
uptick it turns out that although the
number of
uh infections is spiking
in some european countries i think they
mentioned germany italy
spain france i think and
but they say that the death rate is
actually really low
relative to the number of people who are
getting the the coronavirus
now the the speculative reason
is that it's young people who are
starting to mingle and the young people
are getting it
and they're less likely to die so
since we've hidden the seniors pretty
well
that's the the likely explanation is
that young people just don't have the
same outcomes
or or
maybe somebody's using
hydroxychloroquine
that we don't know about now i'm not
saying they are
i'm not saying they're not i am saying
it's not
in the reporting of the story i read
it would just be one of the things i
would have checked hey is there any
difference in the
therapeutics you're using just to see
now i do think the explanation of the
young people versus the old people
is pretty solid but is it the whole
story
wouldn't you like to know
wouldn't you like to know
oh what's this
uh oh spam never mind
so um i would suggest
that one of the possibilities and uh
there was somebody who recently said to
me that uh they were worried that
um well i don't know worried worried
might be the wrong word they were
predicting
predicting that trump probably wouldn't
win
the election because the coronavirus
would be the the primary thing that
moves any independent voters
and that would not be looking good to
which i said
november is a long way away
and the most likely outcome is that
there will be flare-ups in these other
countries
that we thought were the role models of
how to do it well
and here it is it's a flare-up in those
other
european countries because they're
they're gonna the european countries
will be held as the
the most compatible standard to the
united states
because i think people will think okay
if the
you know if you're in a uh an asian
country
and there's a dictator it's not really
as comparable
so that was my prediction that europe
would have flare-ups
but the other part of the prediction is
that the
danger from the coronavirus would be
much less
by november for a variety of different
reasons
one of them might be exactly what's
happening in europe
which is maybe we'll have lots of
infections but not lots of deaths
the president has pointed this out that
why is nobody talking about our death
rate being so good
and that's a good question why are we
focusing on the number of infections
when we know it's something that you
know doesn't
doesn't hurt most people who get the
infection but clearly there's some
doubts about lingering effects
which we should keep an eye on but i
think that's
we don't know enough about that but it's
certainly dangerous
so i think that the likely outcome is
that the
president's performance will appear
and again i always say you can't really
compare leaders from one country to
another it's not
really a thing because their situations
are so different
it's just an apple and an orange you'll
we will know that some will have better
outcomes
but it is not rational to say therefore
the leader if they've done something
differently you'd get a different
outcome
in most cases that won't be obvious
because everybody was guessing in the
in the beginning all right so
but i think we might be in good shape if
we follow the same pattern as europe
even as we get more infections the death
rate will continue to stay down
so as a national problem still big
but it's going to look a lot smaller and
if the president can say hey
we're i'll just pick a number three
weeks away from
vaccination even on election day even if
we don't have a single vaccination
on election day i don't think we will
he's still going to say look we're three
weeks away and
you know we're on the way basically
we're on top of this thing just give me
three weeks
that's pretty strong story so i think
the coronavirus story
will be much smaller in people's minds
on election day than it is today
that's my prediction
all right um we and we also don't know
about herd immunity whether this
t cell thing is what's going on with the
young people
might be that as well in the other
countries so it looks like
coup number two is on kutu
is you know the russia collusion
hoax was the first attempted coup to get
rid of
trump there are still some people who
resist
that that narrative if you will
or that framing but at this point
it certainly looks like members of the
permanent
political class were trying to get rid
of the president
and that seems pretty clear at this
point wouldn't you agree
i guess democrats wouldn't agree but it
feels clear to me
now kutu is shaping up this way and
if you have not studied how intelligence
agencies
influence other countries or even
influence your own country
you probably have a a blank spot
in your understanding of the world so
let me fill that in
a typical intelligence agency thing
would if you wanted to influence
somebody in the long term
would be to let's say influence movies
and television
to produce positive or negative
portrayals of whatever you would like
society to see as in a good way or a bad
way
we know that that happens we know that
it works we know that it's a gigantic
thing
every country that let's say as a
dictator
will control their media their movies
etc
because it's important the reason that
every dictator
the first thing they do is go to control
their own media
is because if that media has a life of
its own
it it becomes the power you know the the
leader
loses power if the news and we're not
the news
that's that too but even if movies and
television are sending the wrong
message it's brainwashing the masses in
a way that would be
cause instability so knowing
that whoever controls the media and i'm
talking about movies and tv
and entertainment etc whoever controls
that
can control the minds of the public so
far
that's not any conspiracy talk right so
far you won't
all understand that that is very science
and history driven
there's no hyperbole going on yet it's a
routine thing to influence the media to
influence the minds of the public
and you can you can see it when it
happens once your filter is set
so once you understand that it's a thing
and it's not a minor thing
it's a really really big big thing
and it's really powerful it's not it's
not the
thing that's happening over in the weeds
while you're watching the important
stuff
it's the important stuff right the thing
you
you maybe were just ignoring is actually
the important thing because that's
what's making people
feel and think the way they feel and
think and therefore they'll
vote according to those feelings so
here's some things that are happening in
this country right now
that fit perfectly into the model of an
intelligence agency
priming the public for a coup
or some kind of a takeover so
you can never know if that's what's
happening
meaning you can never know if
intentionally people are saying all
right let's set up a coup
and we'll do it this way these people
will do this these people would do that
that part i would say is without
evidence
but if it's really really you know sort
of
obvious is right in front of you and
you're primed to recognize it
it's really obvious for example
and by the way when i say an
intelligence agency might be behind it
i don't mean that necessarily it's a
foreign intelligence agency
although it well could be i don't mean
that it's necessarily
our own intelligence agencies who let's
say have a bias
but and are implementing it but there
are plenty of people who are not
shall we say on the payroll of any
intelligence agencies who are
let's say intelligence agency
adjacent a tele intelligence agency
friendly all right so you don't have to
be getting a paycheck from an
intelligence agency
to be part of that construct and in fact
that's
the typical way that things get done
it's a you know
a sort of a network of a loose network
of people who have
similar interests let's say so here are
some things happening in this country
and just ask yourself if this looks a
little bit fishy
number one these protest slash
riot slash looting does it seem to you
that these are a little bit too
persistent
a little bit too organized now i would
say that the vast majority of the people
who show up
probably have good intentions well you
know according to their
view of the world good intentions in
terms of making it a fairer world
good intentions of helping things for
black citizens in this country i'm all
for that
i do a lot of work on behalf of black
citizens
you don't know it all you know because i
don't talk about it as much
but i'm all for that so that's good
and i'm glad that there are people who
are willing to you know go to the
streets to
make that case i think i'm i'm happy
about that too
but remember when i suggested that
you know the energy comes out of these
things if you just wait
well that did work with chop slash
jazz the authorities waited until the
energy went down
and then they dismantled it i thought
that was the right exactly the right
strategy for that specific situation but
are you surprised
at how durable these protests are
it suggests that somebody is getting
paid to organize
that doesn't mean it's true but it
strongly suggests
there's something non-organic happening
because the consistency of it
just raises a flag it looks a little bit
like there's
money from something from somebody
someplace
that might be propping up the the level
of
energy you're seeing sure it's a you
know i'll give i'll give
you that it's a divided country i'll
give you that it's an election year
so there was plenty of energy to be had
and
that energy was going to go somewhere
but the specific place it's going
seems to be the place that you could
most effectively
hide bad behavior let's say if you knew
you wanted to send in some people who
were going to set things on fire
how would you do it well you'd hide them
in a giant crowd of people who have good
intentions
who are unwilling to change what they're
doing because they're fighting for
something important
you know equality under the law equality
of you know the
of your life experience etc and again
i'm all for that
but it makes it really easy to hide the
bad people in
in the crowd and and they become excused
because the news will say but look at
all these good people
this is mostly good people it's a little
bit of stuff on fire but it's mostly
good people
so if you were an intelligence
organization
or you had been trained by one or you
were
adjacent to them and you knew how they
operated it would be exactly what you
would do
you would do it exactly this way you
would organize
well-meaning protests and then you would
make sure there are some bad elements in
there to really mess up
the country
and again i'm not saying that there's
evidence that that's happening
i'm saying that once you learn to look
for it you can see the the fingerprints
but you'd still have to you know you'd
have to do a lot of work to know that's
what you're seeing
that's not confirmation bias
have you seen that the fake news media
is doing stories about
what if trump doesn't leave office
that's a priming move and you've seen
stories
about um what would it take in terms of
the military
removing trump from office if he lost
in a narrow election and refused to
leave
that is a priming move
i'm not saying it's coming from an
intelligence agency
i'm not saying it's coming from any
foreign country
putin or china i'm saying that if they
wanted to mess with us
it would look exactly like this it's
exactly the way an intelligence
operation would be
you'd prime the public and you put the
thought in their mind
huh trump wouldn't leave
what if he doesn't leave because the
if i've taught you anything about
influence and persuasion
the more you think about a topic the
more real it becomes
there's no logic to that that's why it's
persuasion and not
rational thinking but simply making you
deal with the question
over and over again of huh what would we
do
would the military step in it primes you
for that being a real possibility
whereas it would have felt impossible
you know
two years ago but now they've put it in
people's head
as a possibility so you've got that
going on
and then you've got the third thing
which is it looks like some intentional
intentional activity to make the
election outcome less credible
one of those is that the polls would
appear to be faked
does that seem true does it look like
there's a lot of polling that seems
faked yes it does
again that doesn't mean the intelligence
agencies are
faking the polls but that's how they
would do it
you know if they were involved it would
look exactly like that
now because of the mail in voting the
mass mail in voting i'm not i'm not
talking about absentee mailing
which has a long history of being good
enough
um whether you think the mass mailing
is perfectly credible or you don't
a lot of republicans would say no a lot
of democrats would say it's perfectly
good it's
it's going to be fine wouldn't you if
you were an intelligence agency
and you wanted to really mess with this
country wouldn't you
push a type of voting that would be
guaranteed
to be not credible when it was done
you would that's exactly what you would
do you would make sure that people were
talking about
the one thing that you know won't be
trusted
and it's mail in votes now that doesn't
mean that they're not good
it doesn't mean that the mail-in votes
won't be accurate
i'm not saying that they won't be
accurate i'm no expert on that
i'm saying it would be easy to cheat all
you have to do is throw grandma's ballot
in the garbage and you're done
be the world's easiest thing to cheat
and republicans assume that so
you you recently had america's senior
general
general responding to this the chairman
of the joint chief of staff's staffs
general mark milley told members of
congress
because they had to ask can you believe
it they had to ask
this question of the chairman of the
joint chiefs
and he had to answer it is
scary stuff and he said that the
military will not
play a role in november's election and
won't help settle any disputes
if the results are contested now do we
believe that
yes yes we do
i think our military is well trained
i think our military are patriots
it's a volunteer it's a volunteer
service
do you think that the people
volunteering to fight for this country
uh don't know what the constitution says
about
you know the transfer of power do you
think the people who
volunteer to be in the u.s military
do you think that they don't like the
country or that or that they would
they would put up with a coup while they
still have
weapons they you know anybody's going to
have access to weapons
so i don't think the military
is going to be siding with anybody
in an election in this country in 2020
you know anything's possible in the
future
but in 2020 no no
they they are way too well trained and
they are selected
self-selected if you will to fight for
this country
they're not self-selecting to fight
against it
that's not happening all right so let me
uh
reiterate that there is no evidence that
i'm aware of that there's any
uh outside influence on what you're
seeing with the protests
and with the continuous news about hey
you what about
if this election isn't valid um
but it would look exactly like it so
here's what
you would want to do you would certainly
want to find out if any of these people
that are getting arrested for
vandalism and other things during these
protests
especially the organizers you would want
to find out where their money is coming
from
and i'm talking about just the average
guy who gets you know or
or a woman who gets picked up for
breaking a window
if it looks like they're professional
if it looks like they're just doing all
the windows pick them up
find out where the money is coming from
you might find something
now they're probably getting paid in
bitcoin if there's any bad
behavior going on so you probably
couldn't find it but
if they had big deposits or expenses
maybe you could find it
if they had big cash deposits that were
unrelated to any employment
i'd want to know that all right
cloud research a group called cloud
research found that
almost 12 percent of republicans say
they would not report their true
opinions
about the presidential candidate they
preferred on telephone calls
so 12 of republicans would lie
or refuse to answer i guess
uh if they were polled 12
do you think that's real no
that's not real it's way bigger than
that
do you know any republicans who don't
say that they would hide their opinion
from pollsters
i mean they exist but i think it might
be
closer to 80 percent would lie to
pollsters
or at least we consider it uh but i
suppose when the phone rings
you're not really thinking that
necessarily so you just say your opinion
most of the time
so let's accept that 12 percent of
republicans say they would lie to a
pollster
how many democrats according to this
poll 5.4
percent so half as many democrats
would conceal their true feelings uh
what's that mean do you think that the
five percent of democrats
who would conceal their true vote it's
because they're going to vote for biden
would democrats conceal their preference
for biden
so this isn't in the story but
don't you think five percent of
democrats are leading trump at the
moment
and they don't want to tell pollsters
i've got a feeling
that all of the people who are
republican and all of the people who
register as democrat when they say they
wouldn't talk
give the truth to a pollster i think
both the republicans and the democrats
are thinking the same thing
just speculation but it feels like those
are the democrats that are sort of
leading trump if you know what i mean
because seriously in what world would
you be afraid to say you're going to
vote for biden
you wouldn't if you were a democrat you
wouldn't be afraid to say you were going
to vote vote for biden
not even a little bit it's perfectly
socially acceptable
uh and 10 10.5 percent of independents
fell into the shy voter category
so ten percent of independents eleven
percent of republicans
and five percent of democrats are all
maybe pro-trump and not willing to say
it in public
what does that tell you about what the
election is going to look like
it should be a blowout remember
rasmussen is
teasing the the pro-democrat polling
places for holding off on their polling
after the the convention bump
i think you can see it you can see it
coming
protesters built a mock guillotine
outside of jeff bezos house
let me ask you this if you were a
foreign intelligence agency
or any intelligence agency or you had
those skills
and you wanted the protesters to get
more violent
how would you do it well one way would
be to
send some plans for how to build a mock
guillotine
to some organizers you say hey have you
thought of this this would be a fun idea
nice visual for the cameras once you get
a fake
guillotine going you'll get some more
cameras going it'll be fun you'll love
it
now the people who get that say this
would be great i can build that and they
build their fake
guillotine as was done in front of jeff
bezos house
and
what do you think that that is just a
harmless prank
no it's not if you were a an
intelligence agency trying to
influence another country what you do is
you
try to get their imagery and their
communication
to shift from hey let's have a fairer
better world
let's try harder let's work better let's
work together
let's fix this inequality that was
that's the messaging you'd expect
but when you introduce a death sentence
message
a guillotine literally a violent
revolution image does it have an impact
on the public
not by itself by itself
just a joke just some people with bad
bad i'd say bad decision making to do
that
but collectively if you insert enough
of these images of hey maybe this
revolution isn't like the other ones
maybe these protests are not just
protests
maybe they have a violent future
and we're just warning you there's a
little foreshadowing let's just put it
in your head
let's just make you think about it i'm
not saying you should execute
jeff bezos i'm just saying let's think
about it for a day
that's what's happening if you look for
it it's everywhere
it's identical to what a
psychological operation would look like
but we don't know that's what's
happening it just looks exactly like it
apparently the chicago teachers union
did
a glowing endorsement of the people with
the
um with the the guillotine in front of
bezos house
they tweeted and this is literally from
their twitter account
the chicago teachers union twitter
account we are completely frightened by
comma completely impressed by and
completely in support
of wherever this is heading and then it
showed a picture of them assembling the
guillotine
in front of bezos house where this is
heading
where this is heading where this is
heading
you the you the i'm sorry
turns out this mug is a little bit more
on point than i thought it would be
there will be cursing
so i'm warning you now
hide your children if you don't like
cursing
feel free to mute this or turn it off
for now
the teachers unions
are literally encouraging violence
against entrepreneurs violence
against entrepreneurs is coming from an
actual
chicago's teachers union the teachers
unions as you know are the source
of all systemic racism in this country
now that's an over claim but the point
is that if you get the education system
right
black people are educated well instead
of as poorly as our current system
educates them
totally systemic racism and education
they're
they're 100 right about that but the
cause is the teachers unions
because the only way anything ever got
fixed anywhere
in human kind is if there was
competition
they're the ones who remove the
competition but they've gone beyond that
it's one thing to protect your um the
people in your union
that's the job of the union right so if
they're doing stuff where they're
advocating
good things for their members even if
they go too far you'd say well
it's not where i wanted it to go but you
have to admit that it was their job
their job was to get good things for
their their members
but is this that is encouraging
imagery of a killing literally killing
with a guillotine
executing the people in charge and
favoring that
in public is that is that just
protecting their members no it's not
and if i were to look for the source of
intelligence
agency funding from a foreign country
i would look at the teachers unions
because they do have plenty of money
from their members
to do what they need to do in terms of
bribing politicians literally bribing
politicians
and literally getting them elected
through
uh well i almost say literally bribing
because that
implies a legal context let me say
functionally bribing in for all
practical purposes but
in as far as i know in a perfectly legal
way because our system allows it
to legally bribe our politicians to get
what they want and here they're actually
promoting death now do you think
somebody who is a patriot or
loves this country would tweet in public
something that clearly is intended to
make people think more about killing the
elite
do you think that came from an american
who had pure american motives
doesn't sound like it sounds like he
came from china
sounds like it came from a country that
does not have our best interest
in mind so i'm not saying that they're
on the payroll of a foreign entity i'm
saying that if i were a foreign entity
and i had a long-term
plan to destroy the united states
i would target the teachers unions
because that's the lever that moves the
country and
it's only a few individuals who are you
know the powerful people on any
you know leadership group and if you've
got the big cities let's say you got
your chicago your new york
your la a few of the big ones you'd have
enough power so i would guess that a
foreign entity could bribe but maybe
i'll just put a number on it
30 people who were the heads of the big
teachers unions they could bribe
probably just 30 people and how
expensive would that be
not very expensive do you know how much
it costs to bribe 30 people
not a lot of money so for bribing 30
people
or co-opting them in whatever subtle
ways they would get to destroy
the the fiber that holds this country
together the school system
and the equality which it should be
providing but is doing the opposite
apparently the doj i saw this on a
jackpot tweet
that 74 people face federal charges
uh based on portland demonstrations
demonstrations
okay i guess i could call them a
demonstration but
74 people are up for federal charges
i didn't know that many people got
arrested but i guess it adds up over
time
and those are exactly the people that we
should be looking into where their money
is coming from
even if the money is coming from their
parents
and even if the money is coming from the
government
because the government might be paying
them some unemployment benefits
relative to the coronavirus you know the
the extra bump there
uh and i guess there's a congress
congress person who wants to take that
away
so if you get convicted of protesting i
guess and doing something bad while
you're protesting
there's some thought that maybe you
should lose your government benefits
related to the coronavirus i don't think
that's going to get passed but i like
where it's coming from
um i'm trying to mock anderson cooper
today
i'm mocking him off of his ridiculous
comment that the president suggested
drinking bleach
which never happened now when he says
the president suggested drinking bleach
he was mocked on the air by the
trump supporters who knew it was just a
lie
and he acted like he didn't know he
acted like he really thought it happened
now he modified it from bleach to
disinfectant so apparently he did know
that part was a lie
but not a big lie if it was disinfectant
it wouldn't be a big lie to call it
bleach you know that would just be
you know overspecifying wouldn't be the
biggest lie in the world
but it would be a gigantic lie if
nothing like that at all had been
suggested and i tweeted this question
trying to find the best way to mock him
so i tweeted what does anderson cooper
call it when doctors use a special
device
to insert uvc light into a patient's
trachea or lungs
to test whether it can kill viruses
without harming the patient
and then i linked to a news story in
which they're testing exactly that
and i said the answer is drinking bleach
that's what anderson cooper calls it
when doctors put a device into your
lungs that has uvc light
he calls it drinking bleach on live tv
and by the way that's actually what he
called it
is that hyperbole no that's literally
drinking bleach those words are what he
did
to characterize doctors using a special
device
to insert uvc light into a patient's
trachea or lungs
to test whether it could kill virus
without harming the patient
he called that drinking bleach on tv
on a channel that's supposed to be the
 news the news
he did that now has he been corrected
i don't know he seems to have believed
it was true
he actually thought that was
true
now how dumb do you have to be to think
you to think that anybody no matter what
you think of this president
do you think you really win on national
tv and seriously
you're so dumb that you think
you went on national tv and said
oh what about drinking bleach what about
the
and and you you've hypnotized yourself
so deeply
that that sounded like something that
was in the realm of maybe true
no you idiot anderson cooper
you destructive idiot
that was never in the realm of something
that could have been maybe sort of true
it wasn't on the planet
of something that was true maybe dig
into it a little bit deeper
and find out that there was a news story
that very week
about the doctors doing this very trial
with real doctors in a real clinical
setting
how about talking about how well
let me let me do this on the whiteboard
i played my own hoax recently to to give
it a test
of how the the hoax edit works so the
hoax and it works this way so the fine
people hoax
trump did in fact say that there were
fine people
on both sides that's true so they keep
that part
and then trump wanted to make sure that
he was not misinterpreted
so we went on to say just to make sure
that nobody was confused
he said i'm not talking about the white
nationalists and neo-nazis they should
be condemned
totally so to make a true thing into a
hoax you just delete the clarifier
which is what they did they also deleted
some
middle part where he talked about
people just caring about the statues you
know in a historical sense
now the drinking bleach hoax is done a
similar way
the first thing you do is get rid of the
context because when
trump was making a statement about
injecting disinfectant
which was a poor choice of words but he
did clarify it
so they delete the context that there's
a real thing
that light is a disinfectant and that
trump was talking about
light as a disinfectant that was the
context
beyond that is the context that it was
really being tested by real doctors
so you get rid of that so there's no
context you keep the part
[Music]
where trump was asking about could you
in some way inject this into the body
talking about light light so you keep
that part which is a little bit
confusing
and then at the end trump went back to
light
so you'd know that was the topic so he
started with light
that's the context he ended with light
and there was nothing in between
except he used the word disinfectant
which is a proper use of the word
for light but it's not a common use of
it so people were confused
because he used it in the clinical sense
correctly
correctly light is a disinfectant
he used it correctly and then he
clarified that he was always talking
about light
and they just get rid of that so they
show you the clip without the front
the context or the clarifier at the end
i tested this recently with my own hoax
i created i created a
let me give you some context so some of
you have seen i've been tweeting and
talking about
the satanic connections to joe biden's
campaign
the first time i did it and each time
after that that i've talked about it
at least on periscope i always
say i'm not a believer meaning i don't
believe in satan
which should be a key that anything i
say about
joe biden having a satanic connection
means i don't believe it
i do say explicitly and repeatedly
that all we're seeing is confirmation
bias and coincidence
and that you would see this kind of
coincidence in
any complicated topic no exceptions
anything that's a
rich topic with lots of variables will
always have
whatever coincidence you're looking for
just look for a coincidence and you'll
find it
and so i did my demonstration of showing
how many
biden satan coincidences there are
from the pentagon pentagram they use in
their logo
to kamala harris having six letters and
kamala
six letters in in harris and vice
president of the united states the six
words
that the fact that biden had been living
and working
underground like satan i mean these were
clearly jokes
but what you didn't know is that there
was a larger purpose to it
what i did was make sure that i created
a
body of work in which the clarifiers
could be removed by the fake news
i actually created it to be turned into
fake news
intentionally right in front of you
all right now i've been telling my uh
followers on
locals which is a subscription service
so i give them all the secrets first
and i told them exactly what i was doing
that the idea was to get people to lop
off
my clarifiers so that they would treat
me
like a crazy person who believes that
satan is walking the earth in the form
of joe biden
how long did it take for that exact
thing to happen
not long at all it turns out that there
are several articles floating around
in which they did the hoax at it they
they got rid of my clarifiers
they only showed the part where i'm
talking about biden being satan
and then they got rid of the you know
the clarifiers i put at the end
saying that it's you know you shouldn't
believe it and even i don't believe it
so that is the hoax edit
now the news does this all the time this
is the most common thing you see on the
news is the hoax edit
and until you understand that
it's easy it's predictable
it's so predictable that i could cause
it to happen as a public demonstration
right in front of you now the second
part of this is that some people will
see the fake edit
the hoax and they will think it's true
meaning they won't just think that i
think it's true
they will actually think it's true so
what i did was
trick the fake media into using the hoax
edit which would create a way for me to
cross over
into their silo this was the trap door i
was looking for
and they fell into it brilliantly so
every time they show me as a
kook saying that biden has a satanic
coincidences and connections
that is going to be spread to their
viewers
some of whom are going to say i'd better
look into this
i better look into this some of whom
will come to believe it is true
and they will not vote for joe biden now
i wouldn't normally
uh intentionally frame somebody as
satanic
if you were now spreading the fine
people hoax the fine people hoax as i've
told you many times puts a target on my
back
me personally i'm not talking in some
specific
generic way me personally puts a target
on my back
and makes it unsafe for me to go in
public do you see what happened to rand
paul
we'll talk about that in a minute now as
long as joe biden
is spreading this hoax which makes me
personally
in danger then self-defense
is on the table what can you do in
self-defense
is there anything that it would be
immoral in a self-defense
context not really
now you might your your mileage
might differ you might say to yourself
you know
even in self-defense i wouldn't do
something bad to somebody that was this
bad
even in self-defense that's a personal
decision
my personal decision is that if it's
self-defense
everything's on the table everything's
on the table
nothing's off the table if you're
attacked now
obviously you could go to jail if you
overreact and somebody punches you
and let's say you kill them when they're
running away you know you can find lots
of things
that clearly are a bad idea bad strategy
bad self-defense doesn't even qualify
really in self-defense
lots of ways to go wrong i'm just saying
it's a personal preference that i'm not
going to do anything that will put me in
jail if i can avoid it
but i'm just saying it's all on the
table
if it's self-defense there's no immoral
you know that normally it would be
completely unethical and immoral to
brand somebody as satanic but not in
this case
in this case he earned it he has it
coming
it would make the world a better place
if we can get him
off the face of the earth just because
of that
just because the fine people hoax that
targets
me and you i'm making it personal
because i'm telling you what i'm doing
about it
you can make your own decisions but
you're totally targeted if you're a
trump
supporter a word of caution
i asked on twitter how many people made
money
in 2020 by betting on things
on things that i may have predicted or
suggested
it turns out a lot of people made money
placing bets that i would be right about
stuff
right about kamala harris being vice
president if they bet it on if they bet
on her to be president they lost money
if they bet that biden would not be
the nominee they would have lost money
so here is my caution to you i get that
it's fun to bet
totally get that and if you were to bet
let's say
twenty dollars or if you could afford it
if you bet a hundred dollars on some
legal betting site or with your
co-worker
you know i'm not suggesting you do
anything illegal
so let's let's just keep it to whatever
is legal
if it's small and it's just for fun yeah
go ahead
have fun you know betting on my opinions
is as good as anything else but don't
put big bets
on anything that you heard from me
people made a
ton of money in 2016 doing that because
a lot of people heard me and were
convinced
that trump would win and people put big
bets on that stuff
i'm talking like ten thousand dollar
pads hundred thousand dollar bets
big bets now i didn't know about this
until after trump won if i had known
ahead of it
that people were putting serious money
on my opinion
i would have tried pretty hard to talk
you out of it and that's what i'm doing
now
don't put big bets unless you can afford
it
i mean if you're a billionaire and you
want to bet a hundred thousand dollars
knock yourself out
but if you're you know if you're a wage
earner you've got a regular life
don't bet a thousand dollars you know
don't bet
ten thousand dollars because you saw my
opinion
if there's anything i can teach you
about investing
you know this is obviously not investing
but
even in the investment world
past performance does not suggest future
performance
if i had gotten a hundred in a row right
if i'd gotten a hundred in a row right
it still doesn't mean i'm going to get
the next one right
unless i've got some weird superpower so
although
i would agree that some of my
predictions have been
spooky they're so accurate even
i don't believe i can do that forever
all right
so don't have more confidence in me than
i have in myself
i don't think i can predict things
accurately forever
even you know two and a three type thing
obviously everybody gets some wrong
but don't have more confidence than that
than i have in myself
all right nba games will resume
saturday uh and it turns out
that uh the the way they resolved it was
they had they made an agreement the nba
did
to establish what they call a social
justice coalition
and the league and the players said that
in a joint statement
so we're good now i guess systemic
racism has been
largely fixed by this establishment of a
social justice coalition in the nba
and i'm sure that lots of good will come
out of that they'll be producing lots of
actionable
practical things so we're we're all
looking forward to see what comes out of
that
[Music]
i would say that um i was a little
worried
about ongoing division in the country
and racism and systemic racism which is
very real
um but now it's been solved by this
joint
statement about the social justice
coalition so
i don't think it happens immediately um
so let's let's give it a little time but
you know the the thing that the players
were striking about
does seem like it's handled now looks
like they've taken care of it
so congratulations to the nba for fixing
systemic racism without losing a single
paycheck
now that's that's pretty good and the
nba players
still got paid and and they solved
systemic racism did you do that today
no you're not as awesome as they are
you probably didn't do any of that today
but they solved systemic racism
didn't miss a paycheck that's pretty
good work
it needs to be said that i think the dnc
convention which was a hot mess of a
zoom class looking thing would have been
a lot better if harvey weinstein could
have been around to produce it
i'm just saying that's a fact they took
their best player off the table and well
now you see what happens yes harvey
weinstein was
their best their best player
so that you can see that's hurting them
now
sandia labs has a little uh civil war
erupting
uh christopher ruffo or ruffo our ufo
is talking about this on he's following
it for us
on twitter and he investigated and
apparently there's a dissident
electrical engineer stop
stop right there just stop
there's a dissident electrical engineer
i just have to pause to enjoy the tingle
that i have on my entire body
he's not an artist he's not an artist
there's somebody at sandia labs who's
trained in critical thinking
who's actually getting politically
active i thought
my god what happens if smart people
start getting politically active
what would happen what happens if smart
people
start like getting into decision making
on the national level
things could happen so let's see what
kind of trouble this
dissident electrical engineer named
casey peterson is up to i guess he
mailed
he emailed 16 000 employees denouncing
critical race
theory in the lab and he hoped to spark
a rebellion
against the sandia executives and i
thought to myself
number one the sandia executives
probably thinking about firing this guy
do you think he cares about getting
fired
do you know what the market is for
electrical engineers
this electrical engineer is almost as
bulletproof
as i am and i'm pretty
bulletproof
all right even i could lose my job
but this electrical engineer he's got a
job for life
because it's really hard to find an
electrical engineer
and even if all the liberal leaning
companies in the world says no no
we can't hire you because that thing you
did once there's still a plenty of
startups
who are going to say you know i just
want you to do electrical engineering
i you know i don't care about politics
so this guy
realizing that to a large extent you
know it's not a perfect world but to a
large extent
he's bulletproof and
he's an electrical engineer which means
that if he were to get into
a debate with anybody on the other side
he would eviscerate them because
if i might if i might swear just one
more time
the reason that the electrical engineer
would eviscerate
the people he argues with is because the
electrical engineer
is not a idiot
that's it that's a big advantage not
being a idiot
and he's not so because he's
electrical engineer you have to be
pretty smart to be one of those
and so i don't even know exactly what
critical race
theory is how many people in the public
know what that is even
are there that many people who can even
define critical race theory
i don't know exactly what's in it but
at least part of what he is concerned
about is that they were going to
separate black people who work for the
company
to be in their own special groups which
is kind of suspect
and then i guess the white employees
would have to take classes to learn how
bad they are
they're because they're they're biased
and racist
so that's part of it but i don't know
what else is in there
so we'll see if he gets fired i can't
imagine he would keep his job
but good things are going to happen all
right how many of you saw the
the video of rand paul trying to leave
the
republican national convention being
immediately swarmed by
angry and dangerous protesters
who were jostling them and the two
police officers who were trying to
protect them
as i heard rand paul say and this is
amazing because he had a mask
on he was concerned that the two police
officers didn't know that he was a
member of congress
so he as he told it he was telling them
i'm a member of congress
you'd better call reinforcements he
wasn't just
a guy leaving the convention and he was
trying to tell the police officers
you'd better get reinforcements now they
i think they did call for reinforcements
but by that time
that they got an amount of most of the
trouble now
rand paul is quite a baller in my
opinion
this would be the third time that i'm
aware of
that he's been targeted just for being
rand paul
one was you know when he was at the uh
the baseball field when the shooter came
he luckily he did not get shot but he
was targeted
for being who he is along with the other
people who were who they were
the republicans he was targeted by his
neighbor
all right and literally attacked and had
a long recovery from that that was
pretty bad and now he gets
assaulted i think assaulted would be the
right word um
by this crowd and and he just keeps on
going
and he even got assaulted by a crowd who
was on the same side with him because he
introduced
the legislation that they were mad about
that the legislation they wanted to get
rid of the
no knock warrants he actually introduced
a bill with the name of the victim
that the brianna taylor is at it
and they were saying say her name say
her name like he was some random guy
instead of the one guy who was as on
their side as they could possibly be
on that topic so
that's the first story but there's a
there's a second story that's like it
that's different
rand paul is probably about my size
meaning that if an angry crowd were to
surround me
i would feel in quite a bit of danger
because of just the you know the
poundage they have
versus the physical size that i have so
that would be pretty dangerous for a guy
my size
for a woman who was you know smaller for
anybody smaller
these these crowd danger situations are
pretty pretty scary
but it turns out that the crowd also
noticed a guy named
dan bongino you know dan bongino right
now dan bongino would be whatever is the
opposite
of rand paul in terms of physicality i'm
not making fun of
rand paul i'm just saying that dan
bongino
is a beast have you seen the arms on
that guy
have you seen what he can deadlift he's
a beast
x you know x uh police training was a
secret service
so he's got all the he's got all the
serious um
hand-to-hand training i assume i assume
he's got all that training
and he's just a monster of a of a human
specimen
now he got surrounded by the crowds
except here's the thing that's different
one look at dan bongino especially if
they knew of him or knew of his work
he's a predator he's not a victim
and you surround a predator and here's
what you have to be thinking
and i hope that they were as they
surrounded him
were they aware that in his mind he's
having a conversation with them i think
he said something like
you know watch my show or you know he he
had some banter going
but you know based on his training
and the fact that he's a predator you
know that in his mind was this following
calculation
true or false he was thinking
which one do i kill first
you know that's what he was thinking
because he was thinking all right
should i take out the big one first
because then i can end the smaller ones
more easily
or should i take out a small one and
just you know destroy somebody's skull
right in front of the rest and would
they be horrified enough
that that would make them leave should i
break a leg
should i take out an eye should i
permanently somebody
or should i actually kill them
i don't know dan beyond bongino
personally i'm not a mind reader
but i would think that if you put me in
that situation
and i don't have any of that training
that's what i'd be thinking
i'd be thinking which one to kill first
and how to do it i just wouldn't have
the skills to pull it off
if i had the skill to pull it off yeah
dan bongino could have kicked the
out of the entire crowd
in any order he wanted to do it
while protecting i don't know he might
have been there with his wife or
something
but while protecting other people
because he has those skills and i
wondered if the protesters
were even aware how close they were to
death
although i think he's smart enough that
he wouldn't have actually killed them
that would be too much
trouble for him but he would have messed
them up
there would have been bodies on the
street if they had even just
just gone a little bit too far and to
hear bongino
completely calmly talking to them versus
the image of rand paul who was in real
danger
rand paul was in serious danger that
there's no joking about that
but dan bongino i think the protesters
were in serious danger
but it didn't happen i asked this
question
on twitter has joe biden ever fired
anybody
because if he's never fired anybody he's
never managed anything
that matters joe biden has never
fired anybody that i've heard of now
probably in his life he has but wouldn't
you like to hear from anybody he's fired
because we have this this endless string
of people that trump has fired in the
past
who say bad things about him do you
think that the people
that biden fired if there are any who
knows if they exist
but do you think if he fired anybody
that they have a good opinion of him
that's news i think we should find
anybody that biden has fired
and talked to them about how great biden
is
because i think they would tell us a
story now if there is no such thing
as a person who's ever fired been fired
by biden
how can you take him seriously as a
candidate to run
and manage the united states you don't
go from
managing nothing to managing the biggest
country in the world
trump went from managing a vast
financial empire with lots of moving
parts
to managing another vast empire with
lots of moving parts
that's pretty close to the kind of
talent you want to bring to the job
let's see what joe biden has speaking of
the trump administration
i have a theory that no one has ever
explained
to trump himself why these uh
the idea of using the over-the-counter
saliva test strips that don't require
any machine to get a result you just
look at the change of color sort of like
a pregnancy test
and they're not on the market because
the fda has
has some concerns about them now of
course they don't catch
as much they're not as
there are words that the scientists like
to use specific
specificity versus accuracy etc but the
basic idea is that the test strips
would not get uh every every infected
person
as accurately as the professional kinds
of tests
but they would be so cheap and so so
ubiquitous
that it would overwhelm that small
defect of not being as
as accurate because you just test twice
test twice test today test tomorrow and
even if they're a little less accurate
it's probably going to pick it up
so given that the as i said before that
the trump administration
is silent on this question they haven't
approved it
they haven't not approved it they don't
respond to it
the working assumption you should have
is that this is
incompetence or uh or corruption
so this would be just a glaring
flag for incompetence or corruption
now that doesn't mean that trump
personally knows
this math because it's a little
complicated when you explain this to
people they
they just say wait wait a minute how in
the world
could a test which is less
uh sensitive than these other tests how
in the world is this a good idea
and it's hard to explain it takes a
little explaining all right
they're so cheap you could do it at home
everybody could do it every day
it wouldn't get every every infection on
the day it started
but it would definitely get the vast
majority of them
that alone is enough to you know it
mocks i would say it mimics
heard uh well i won't use that because
you won't like the analogy
but it would be so effective even
inaccurate
that it would basically stomp out the
virus for all practical purposes
you would make the country's economy
open up now
if anybody ever explained that to trump
the way i explained it so he could
understand
that there's already a cheap easy way
out of the coronavirus
you just have to understand the math
which is a little backwards it doesn't
make sense
that the inaccurate tests are the ones
you want
that doesn't make sense to your brain
when you first hear it so
i don't believe anybody's ever made that
case to trump
because it would just be too obvious
that that's what he would
be pushing to do or at the very least he
would tell us
where we're at with that or why we can't
do it
so there is some kind of massive either
corruption or incompetence
in the trump administration i don't know
exactly where
could be in advisers could be at the fda
it could be both
but there's something seriously wrong
and i'm not saying
that i'm so smart i know that this is
the way to solve the problem
i'm saying that we need an answer just
an answer why it's not the right idea
which would be fine or an answer that
they're working on it which would be
fine as well
so the fact that the democrats are not
digging into that
suggests that they also meeting the fake
news
you know why isn't cnn reporting on what
i just said i mean here's
here's one of the most high profile
trump supporters in the world
and i'm calling out corruption or
incompetence you can't tell which one
from the outside
in the trump administration why is that
not why is that not news
haven't you seen that every time there's
anybody who's a trump supporter
who turns on him in any way it's
automatically news
do you know why this isn't news because
if they highlight the fact there's a
solution to the coronavirus
trump would learn about it presumably
he's not learning about it through his
his advisors he would learn about it for
the first time
and then he would solve the
crisis so they can't report on it
is that the worst thing you've ever
heard in your life that's that's what
we're living in right now
that's the world you're living in is
what i just described
all right uh jeff giza i don't know if i
pronounce his right name right
g-i-e-s-e-a is that the right geez
jesus giza i hope i didn't mess that up
too bad
jeff but he said this
and yeah this is the sort of thing you
couldn't have said a few months ago
without getting cancelled
but because of the way events have gone
and things not working out with the
protests etc
you can now say this out loud in public
and not get cancelled so i'm gonna
i'm gonna say it as well so what jeff
says is the power
of framing is incredible of course i've
taught you that
whoever frames the issue gets to be the
owner
and controller of that conversation so
if you can frame better
you you win the persuasion he said the
power of framing is incredible for
example
what if or and he said in quotes our
problem with police shootings and quotes
was reframed as quote our problem with
people resisting arrest
now it's not a a new thought you know
people have talked about that before
and then he said this is an equally if
not more plausible reframe of the core
issue it's not just equally plausible
it's exactly describing the situation
if you can't give me some examples of
people being shot when they're not
resisting arrest i get the police need
to be
trained as well as they can i get that
we need to put
more attention into non-lethal ways i
totally get
that police work in general could be
better
but i also totally get you could say
that about everything
that you know the the police are not the
one thing that's not operating 100
at all times that's just everything
all right we should work on it and make
it better but let's not be unrealistic
you can't take the police training
with every situation being different and
all the people in it being different
you're just not going to eliminate
bad shootings but you can certainly
eliminate
100 well you couldn't eliminate 100 of
it but you could certainly go a long way
to teaching people how to not resist the
rest
or to assume they get caught they'll be
shocked you could come up with a
clever saying like resisting arrest will
get you killed but you make it rhyme in
some way
so i would say that you couldn't really
say that a few weeks ago even
because it would sound like you were
just a racist but at this point it's so
obvious that there are not any other
solutions on the table
other than this vague idea of training
people better
this vague idea that nobody has any meat
on about
non-lethal force better options
there's one thing you could do today
every single person could tell their kid
how
to not resist arrest you could do that
today
where where is the national campaign
teaching people not to resist rest
do you know why that doesn't exist it's
because white
white people infantilize the black
citizens of this country
it's the most racist thing that white
people do
now and they do you know lots of racism
so there's lots to choose from
but i would say maybe the worst thing
no definitely the worst thing yeah
probably the worst thing
is that white people can't say what i
just said
because they're afraid of getting
cancelled and the problem is if you
don't learn to
stop resisting arrest you're just going
to keep getting shot
there's no way around that that there's
no other way that goes
if you keep resisting arrest doesn't
matter if you're white
doesn't matter if you're black doesn't
matter probably matters if you're male
or female because
women are perceived as less dangerous
because of the difference in physicality
but certainly if you're not willing to
take responsibility
you're going to get more of this now why
is it that white people can't say
what i'm saying without the risk of
getting canceled and as you know i have
just
less risk because you know i made my
money already
and the reason is that white people
treat black people like their children
like children if you are going
to talk to an adult
let's say let's say uh let's say let's
take race out of it okay
let's take race completely out of this
let's say you're a
white adult and you see that a whole
bunch of other white people
are getting shot by police but every
time you look into it
there's except for the no knock warrant
thing that i think obviously needs to
get fixed but every time you looked into
it
it looked like there was some resisting
arrest again this will be a conversation
hypothetically
where only white people are police only
white people are getting arrested
and when they resist they're getting
shot and you're talking to another white
person about it would you say to them
i think there's a problem with the
police
no you wouldn't no you wouldn't if you
were talking to a white person about
other white people getting
killed by police for resisting arrest
you wouldn't say there's a
police problem
even if there is even if there is and of
course like i said could be better
it could be more non-lethal solutions
you would say
to the person you treated like an adult
how about you stop resisting
arrest
how about you start there if you can do
that
and people are still getting shot i will
march with you
but don't be a child about this you know
don't be a child
the problem is obviously the resisting
arrest
we all know it and if you're not willing
if you're
if you're a white person and you're not
willing to say that as clearly as i'm
saying it
to another black adult you're not
treating them like an adult
you're not you're being a racist
if you can't take up
treat an adult black person like an
adult
you're a racist that's it
i don't know how you can see that any
other way honestly i don't think there's
an argument to that at all
all right um as michael shellenberger
keeps telling us we now have germany and
california to show us
that the green new deal doesn't work
before you could have said to yourself
hey
i wonder if the green new deal would
work i wonder if we could get
rid of all of our nuclear plants and get
rid of our gas
gas energy production stuff natural gas
i wonder if that would work
you don't have to wonder anymore we were
we ran two gigantic trials
one in germany and it collapsed totally
it just doesn't work
one in california and it collapsed
exactly the same way
meaning the meaning that we couldn't
keep the lights on
as soon as we got rid of nuclear and
started closing down some
it looks like there's some gas plants
that are unlined or
targeted to be closed down we don't have
to wonder anymore
the mystery is gone now we just have to
choose
keeping the lights on or keep or not
keeping the lights on
those are the choices we don't have to
listen to children
telling and i'm talking about you greta
we don't have to listen to children
telling us how to run our energy
programs anymore
because we tried it children we tried it
the child way
didn't work if had only been california
you could say well california did it
wrong
but it was germany too all right it was
germany too
and i hear they're terrific on the
coronavirus so i'm pretty sure they're
good on this other stuff
and we do generally think that germany
is good at executing
that sounded like a pun but it wasn't
meant to be germany
is good at executing and by executing i
don't mean killing people that's the pun
but i mean that they're good at building
an industry they're good at you know
managing a situation
they're good at it and they couldn't
make the green new deal work
germany couldn't make the green new new
deal work
how about california are there any smart
people in california
yeah yeah do you know where smart people
like to live
california i'm not saying there are no
smart people in other places
but look at silicon valley lots more
people
you know i would think that the iq of
california well
averages are misleading but probably the
smartest
a lot of the smartest people in the
country are in california not all of
them
but a lot of them with all those brains
in california and all of those brains in
germany
they couldn't make the green new deal
work didn't even get close really
michael shellenberger has been warning
us of that for years
and now he can just do his victory dance
but who can be happy about this
of course you can't so it's not really a
victory dance but it is definitely a
told you so
listen to the people get it right if
there's somebody who keeps predicting
things
and they keep getting it right listen to
them next time
all right that's that's all for today
talk to you tomorrow
