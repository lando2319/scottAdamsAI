come on in come on in
come on come on
you know you need this sometimes you
want it
sometimes you do it on a habit but
sometimes
sometimes you need it gather round
gather round you'll be fine you'll be
fine
oh that's so good are you ready
are you ready to make it official
here we are all you need is a copper mug
or glass of tanker chelsea style they
can't change
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like afternoon coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
quells revolutions yeah
there hasn't been one yet not when
you're drinking the simultaneous except
that happens
now go
ah oh yeah
so can somebody tell me in the comments
what is the approximate estimate of the
number of protesters who have descended
upon
our capital is it
a hundred is it
a thousand ten thousand
hundred thousand i'll bet you don't know
do you
i have no idea i'm seeing a few
estimates now
these look like wild guesses because
they're all over the place
i don't even want to read them because
they're just all over the place
now i think what we're seeing
is that the news industry has decided
that instead of reporting the news
they will try to stop the news so
so the news has decided to try to
suppress
the protests and let me tell you where i
am on the protest because
if i don't say that right up front
everybody will wonder well where are you
so i know what to think about your dumb
opinion
here's my take i like to do this thing
called being consistent
and it's really annoying but i do it
anyway
and here's how i'm going to apply it in
this situation
when colin kaepernick was doing his
kneeling and disrupting this
fine sport situations uh while many of
you said
how dare he make us feel uncomfortable
and disrespect our flag and words to
those effect
i said the opposite and i said
that's a good protest good protest
makes you feel uncomfortable that's
what it's supposed to do i just tweeted
something from aoc
that i think was maybe a month ago or so
she tweeted exactly the same idea that
a protest is supposed to make the people
who are viewing it uncomfortable
now if i would say that about colin
kaepernick
shouldn't i be consistent i believe i
should
should i also not be consistent in which
i always say
don't blame a few bad apples for you
know for the
spoiling the whole bunch you know what i
mean every big group
is going to have some bad people in it
so it doesn't define the group
so let's start there so do the
protesters
have a let's say a free speech right
to do what they're doing well i say yes
i say that this situation
called for let's say a dramatic
tap on the shoulder now of course i
oppose
all forms of you know violence or
destruction of property
if a few windows get broken in the
course of a
major demonstration i wouldn't make a
big deal about it no matter who it was
you know few windows
a little bit of damage that's going to
come with the free speech and with
the right to assemble and all the rest
so i'm not going to make a big deal
about the little stuff
if somebody got killed and we're still
in fog of war so i don't know
what the circumstances are but there's
reports that somebody got shot
if that happens it's a tragedy and
should never happen but we don't know
what that's about and i'm not making any
assumptions about it
what i feel about this is that
the congress of the united states and
the
state governments collectively let's
just say or a government
they gave us an election without giving
us confidence
so that's the part we could all agree on
right
we can disagree about you know was the
election stolen it wasn't not stolen but
there is one thing we can agree on
the congress and the state governments
especially did not provide
the people of this country a transparent
credible election and when they didn't
provide one that was transparent and
credible to begin with
and they did have a chance really to
correct that
in the form of maybe audits or
looking at the source code of any voting
things that sort of thing
maybe maybe a real hearing of the
evidence
as opposed to having everything kicked
out of the court
four doctrine of latches and for
standing and stuff like that
whereas the fake news
has decided to report consistently that
somehow the
evidence alleged evidence purported
evidence
of any election irregularities or fraud
they report as if the court cases
actually listened to the evidence
but that didn't happen
there were lots of cases rejected for
technical reasons
but not because of the evidence they
didn't get to hear the evidence
so what happens when you've got a
fake news industry sitting on top of an
incompetent government
that does not deliver the single most
basic element of the republic
a fair transparent
credible election
now what should be the
response of the public what's the proper
response
to a government that is too incompetent
or unwilling
who knows uh bribed we don't know
whatever the reason is i'm not even sure
it matters
but they were incapable for whatever
reason to deliver
the most basic element that holds the
whole thing together and they could get
away with that
because the fake news industry protects
them
so under these circumstances and i don't
have an opinion
about what might be found if we you know
did moral audits etc
i feel that any system that can be
corrupted will be
but beyond that i don't have an opinion
on any specific claim
except that most of them probably will
be debunked
maybe all of them easily could happen
but do we not agree
that no matter what happened our
government
didn't let us check it out it prevented
the people from gaining the the
certainty and the
confidence that they wanted and it is
the most
have i mentioned this yet the most basic
part of the entire system
and we were prevented from it
by incompetence or who knows greed
stupidity whatever it is that drives our
collective governments
state in federal but they were certainly
protected
by the fake media the way they report it
so what is the proper level of response
in my opinion you're looking at it
you're looking at it the the response
that you're seeing
in my opinion and this is entirely
subjective i won't even try to
i won't make any attempt
to convince you to my opinion because
this is just subjective right
you all get to decide how big is the
problem
what are the other alternatives besides
protests because our system allows
protest right
so how big is the problem so how big
should the response be
you know it's got to be big enough to
address the problem right would you want
to have another election
in which we allowed our government to be
this incompetent
again i'm not saying that the election
was necessarily
fraudulent the incompetence is that they
didn't give us credibility
they didn't give us a process we could
trust they didn't give us transparency
and then when we had questions
when we had questions
and then when we had questions those
didn't let us answer them
so what is the right size
of the response to that i think you're
looking at it
i think that the right size was we're
not gonna
hurt anybody ideally they're not gonna
hurt anybody
i don't really see bloodlust in the
crowd
do you i feel as if this crowd might
leave the scene
a little bit neater than they found it i
feel if they find anything that needs
any repair
there are a lot of guys with trucks and
skills
they might actually fix some things that
needed repairs more than they break
stuff
this is not a regular protest
in order to get these
people all the way into the center
of the capitol
something went wrong i heard uh i forget
who it was i think it was somebody on
fox uh was uh
maybe you um brett bear i'm not sure
but whoever said it sounded wise that
what we're seeing is not a
not a failure of security it's a failure
of government
and i think that's exactly right it's
not a failure of security
security actually is i think doing a
good job
did you see anything that the security
did that
looked like a bad job i didn't i think
security is doing an excellent job
the the protesters had numbers and so
the
security wisely you know gave a little
grounds
just like they should so textbook i
think they're doing a great job
um so yeah we don't know the anything
about the situation to the shooting
my guess is it's sort of a one-off
situation i doubt it was representative
of what's going on there
so here's my feeling
if you're worried about something like
taking over the government
let me remind you that the government
is not that room that's not the
government
the government is not the real estate
the government is not the thing behind
the closed door
the government doesn't need a building
they can
zoom literally they can zoom
so what the protesters are taking over
is not
anything like the government what
they're taking over is some space
because it makes people uncomfortable
and did i mention that making people
uncomfortable
is the point of a protest do
you think that our election security and
you know transparency do you think it
would suddenly get better for the next
election
if this were not happening i'd love to
think that was going to happen
but i doubt it don't you
don't you doubt anything would happen
for next time
this this is exactly the size and type
of response that i think is perfectly
fit to the
size of the problem and the fact that
absolutely nothing was going to
happen to fix this for next time nothing
was going to happen
you get that right does anybody disagree
with that
you can tell i mean you don't have to be
some you know
management genius you don't have to be a
world famous political pundit to know
that the following statement is real
the government wasn't going to fix it
for next time
right did anybody think well
now we saw some complaints i guess we're
good for next time
because next time next time they're
gonna fix it
literally not one person who's
listening to this
thinks the government was just gonna
 fix it
it wasn't whatever it was that made them
not fix it last time
the time before the time before the time
before in terms of
how good election security could be
compared to what it is
whatever that was it's not different
today the only thing that's
 different is that a bunch of
people in red hat
said we're gonna stand in your
building until you
just treat us seriously just treat the
concern
seriously yeah yeah yeah i get
i get that you believe see you being
somebody out there you believe that the
election's over we should
have a peaceful transfer i
i agree i do think the election's over
in my opinion
uh you know ever since the the media
called it for biden i congratulated him
publicly the same day
and at no point since i congratulated
biden
same day as the media did at no point
if i reversed that and said oh he's not
going to get into office
to be it was obvious the system would
just grind along
but no matter who takes office
we can't let this happen again
right i don't think i don't think
we should stand for it and if that
requires
taking over some space not taking over
the government
because the government just needs a
phone right
the government is the government no
matter where they are they just go
somewhere else
nobody was kidnapping the government
nobody was trying to assassinate the
government
it wasn't really about the people so
much
it was about a system that yes just
isn't working
just isn't working so
if some patriots want to take some
personal risk
and there's a lot of personal risk
involved here if some patriots want to
take some personal risk
i give them the same respect that i gave
colin kaepernick which is if you're
going to do it
make somebody uncomfortable or else you
didn't do it right so
we're seeing some people making some
people uncomfortable
i can't oppose that but i also don't
condone any kind of violence or threats
that sort of thing
but i do understand the size of the the
size of the response i understand the
emotion
i understand the reason i would have
maybe a difference of opinion
about how certain i am about you know
what size of fraud there is and
whether or not it would reverse things
but we can all agree
that the system did not do
what it is supposed to do make you feel
you voted in a credible way make you
feel you could check make you feel later
if you had questions you could look into
them
make you feel your concerns were heard
none of that happened
none of that happened not only did none
of that happen
in terms of you know concerns being
properly
aired out and addressed but the fake
news
reported that it had been just
consistently
just keeps reporting yeah totally that
stuff's been looked into
by i don't know now again
i think 95 of all the alleged claims
are complete uh and
maybe the other five percent too i just
uh agree with everybody who said if we
can't tell
we didn't have an election right
it might be completely accurate it might
be accurate enough you know the vote
count and maybe the outcome is
about what it should be maybe but if you
can't
tell you didn't really have an election
did you
you just had sort of the impression of
an election
so i don't think that i need to be
too worried and i would recommend that
you not be too worried about this
snowballing into some bigger thing i
believe
that the limit of what can be done
is being done which is to make a
statement that you can't forget
and you can't really forget this can you
right
simply by the fact well
um i just have to say this
because it's just honest and you
wouldn't uh
you wouldn't tune in if you didn't uh
hear me say something like this once in
a while
i've said before that when i hear
stories about serial killers
i often have two feelings one is my god
that's that's horrible
that the things that serial killer did
and then often
depending on how industrious the serial
killer was and how
how well he planned and executed and
built his underground bunker or whatever
he did
i'm also thinking but that was a pretty
good plan
you know strategy wise it was pretty
good
pretty good so i feel as though
you know we're all human that you could
have you could have two conflicting
feelings and hold them at the same time
and i'm having two conflicting feelings
that i'm holding at the same time about
the protesters
one is that i don't want to see anybody
get hurt and i don't want to see the
capital defaced i don't want to see
just any unnecessary damage right so
don't want any of that
so i can hold that thought in my head
while at the same time
hold the other thought in my head that
is that was one awesome protest
how long did it take him to slice
through security and get on the inside
of the capitol building
i i've got a feeling that the antifa is
looking at this protest
don't don't you have this image of
antifa
let's see i must have my anti-fog
disguise around here somewhere
but don't you have an image of antifa
watching this on tv and they're like
hey hey look at this these maggot guys
they're trying to protest they don't
know how to protest
we've had a lot of practice i'll tell
you we know how
they did what they've penetrated the
inner core of the capitol building of
the capital of the united states
in 10 minutes
okay that's some good protesting that
that's some good protesting
right there that's some good protesting
so i would not worry that this is going
to
you know snowball into some big
revolution it doesn't look like it has
any kind of energy for that
what it does have is the right kind of
energy
that in my opinion very subjective
i'm fine if you disagree with this
because there's lots of room for
disagreement here
in my opinion it is sized correctly
to the problem sized correctly
just like colin kaepernick colin
kaepernick didn't punch
anybody he didn't he didn't start a fire
he just got in one knee and offended
people
his his protest was well sized
for the attention it got to the size of
the problem he was talking about
so i can't i can't uh fault i never
fault protesters if they're not hurting
anybody
because that's one of the best parts
about this place
yeah auntie fra hold my beer
now um i do
expect um
i do expect the trump supporters
to be unusually peaceful
yeah i know it's getting a little rowdy
down there but i would trust them
to know what is the limit of a good
aggressive protest
and what is too far and i'd be really
disappointed
you know if if they don't kind of
collectively
feel that limit without anybody needing
to tell them
so i feel we're in good shape
uh good shape in terms of you're
watching freedom of
speech freedom of expression and by the
way
compliments to the capital security
capital police i mean i think you've got
to give it up for the capitol police
they are playing it exactly right
because the maga people are not likely
to trash all the furniture and set
things on fire
so so letting them through so long as
you know other people have been secured
it was the right play and i think that
everybody's going to appreciate that in
time
so i'm seeing a well executed protest
and i'm seeing a
security service that's acting very
responsibly
what i am also seeing is a media
that is trying to suppress it rather
than
appreciate where it's coming from so i
would say that the worst
actors right now are the media the the
way it's being covered
the uh the stars
the stars of the protesters and the
stars are the
uh the dc police who are trying to keep
things under control they're both stars
right now
both doing great work and congress of
course
i would say is a disaster that's why
they're
that's why this is happening congress is
a disaster and the news
the news business is just uh
absurd at this point
somebody says in the comments this is
gaslighting101
no no uh you must be new here
read my book loser think there's a
chapter on there about people like you
who
who don't know what gaslighting is
literally you just called me something
that i have a chapter in a book
well it's probably not your best moment
all right um trump's twitter is banned
interesting is that true can i get a
oh it looks like a lot of people saying
it uh trump's
twitter is banned
somebody says capitol police killed the
person
yeah i don't think we know anything
about the shooting yet
um
somebody's dead i i understand
that for those of you who are too stupid
to understand
the following point i'm going to say it
three times
nobody's in favor of violence nobody's
in favor of violence nobody's in favor
of violence
now can you stop saying duh somebody got
shot because nobody's in favor of
violence
so the dumb people here should maybe go
to another live stream
if that's too complicated for you
so trump is blocked unless he deletes
two tweets
well somebody needs to tell me what
those two tweets are were they tweets
that supported the
the protests
i'm saying in the comments it's not true
some people support
violence you know there's always
somebody it's a big crowd
so i would agree with the statement that
in a big crowd there's somebody who
supports just about anything
so he's got a 12 hour suspension so
have you noticed that social media and
the mainstream news are acting
as the gatekeepers of let's say order
do you want them to have that job is it
the job of social media
and the job of the news to
manage the news in a way that
controls our natural passions
or our inflamed opinions or our
aggressive protests is it really the job
of the news to do that
it's very good that they don't make it
worse so we don't want them
you know mixing things up but couldn't
they be a little more neutral
and just say what's happening i feel as
if they're trying pretty hard to
to reduce it now i don't know how big it
is
because as far as i can tell it's not
been reported
the the number of people there if i
found out that the number of people
there was i don't know 500
and it's not growing i have a very
different opinion of it than if it was
500 an hour ago but it's 2
000 now that i'd be a little worried
but you're not going to get any
reporting on that because if they report
that the number is going up
it will make the number go up some more
so the news
can't really report what's there without
changing it
there's some heisenberg principle or
something there
i don't know what i'm talking about so
ignore that part
uh yeah and
yeah and if it's true and i assume it is
because everybody's saying it
that twitter has suspended trump i'm
sure
just guessing it has something to do
with uh
whipping up uh passions
so
there's a funny joke in the comments but
if you missed it
that's on you
see metro dc police confirmed the girl
was
shot and died so
i would make uh i'll probably say this
ten more times
before tomorrow um i would make no
judgments
if i were you on the question of
uh what happened with that shooting
because it's fog of war and whoever got
shot
could well have done something that you
know earned that response
but it could have also been a tragic
mistake let's wait until we find out
um
why would they take a off a video
calling for
peace i don't know is that what happened
jack speer put out today they should
pull out the 25th amendment
yeah i think you're going to see a lot
of people calling for trump to resign
or to be removed from office
and i don't really have an opinion on
that
i don't think it matters frankly
frankly what would it matter it's a few
weeks
i don't think it doesn't make much
difference
um all right i'm seeing in the comments
that trump asked for a peaceful retreat
and that he was accused of inciting
violence well only
only trump could word a tweet that asked
for a peaceful retreat
and make it sound like he was asking for
violence
trump told people to come down and go
home according to the comments
all right well here's what i would not
worry about
i would not worry about it getting out
of hand i think the
protests are proportionate and any kind
of death of course is
not what everybody wants but i don't
think that represents what was happening
as a whole and i think
that this country needs a more
transparent and credible election system
and this might go a long way toward
creating the energy to make that happen
because seriously if we're having this
conversation
in the next presidential election
we should do this again
right i mean if
if nothing changes and the election is
just as
non-transparent forget about being
fraudulent or fair
if it's non-transparent it's worthless
so uh if we don't fix it by next time
maybe there will be a bigger protest
we'll see all right that's all for today
i'll see you in the morning don't panic
you will be fine
all right and uh bitcoin is going crazy
you get it congress doesn't thank you
uh you are intentionally dishonest and
speaking in opposition
wait what you're intentionally dishonest
in speaking
opposition to what can be realized okay
blake
you need to work on your commenting
skills so they make more sense
i can't say that i don't even know what
that means
um will trump end up in jail
you know almost anything's possible now
trump tower blah blah blah where was the
sip you missed it
yeah i was i was asking on twitter where
which side is antifa
on shouldn't the antifa be on the same
side
because chaos
uh force it's a false flag to force the
vote tonight
it doesn't look like a false flag to me
can certification be delayed for a week
i think they have five days
to do the certification all right let's
see
it makes a difference because democrats
are in power they think they can do what
yeah
i think i think that the uh protests
are the people who feel
somewhat abused by this election i think
it's them just saying
um that they're a force to be reckoned
with
so i'm not sure that that's bad
trump should address the crowd in person
now he shouldn't
no he's he's a match in gasoline and
now he should stay away uh
is there any way to hold the media
accountable probably not
because if you try to hold them
accountable the only you'd destroy free
speech as well
[Music]
um so
senator rand paul says what do you say
obs
he said it was a big mistake to do this
he said of the challenge to
like oh so he's saying that the
challenge to the electoral college vote
was a big mistake
uh maybe maybe
all right that's all for now stay cool
you'll be fine
