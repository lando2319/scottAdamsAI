and welcomed to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and aren't you lucky to have
made a year at this time in this place
because well even if you're watching it
on a recorded basis you're still special
and if you'd like to take this
experience up to
stratospheric levels
how would you do it well easily all you
need is a copper mug or a glass a tanker
cello for Stein a canteen jungle flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
yeah I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine him in the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous set but it
happens now go
ah
yeah that's good
all right all systems are working
let's hit the news
what would be the most surprising thing
that could happen in the news
see check the headlines uh New York
Times runs a crossword
shaped as a swastika
on Hanukkah
um
um
um
what
what
did I say yet
what
now I'm a little unclear about this
story
I've seen I've seen the crossword puzzle
I can see why people say that's
swastika-like I get that
uh
yeah I get it I get it
does it look intentional
do you think it was intentional
I don't think so no I think it was I
think it was chance but it was pretty
unfortunate all right how many of you
how many of you who were not soccer fans
took my advice
that the World Cup would not simply be
soccer
and that you would see something
for the ages
did anybody take my advice and watch it
even though you're not a soccer fans
if you did
now this is just my opinion right so
this is purely subjective just my
opinion
it was the greatest sporting event of
all time
in my opinion
and I'm not even sure it'll ever be
topped it was the greatest
sporting event of all time I
this is the first time this has ever
happened to me
I I was watching alone in my man cave
you know at part of it
and I actually screamed
like I cheered out loud alone do you
know how do you know
I've never done that alone I mean you do
it sometimes if people are in the room
right you get you know you're I've never
cheered when I was alone
I mean this thing moved me like
nothing's ever moved me sporting wise
right now if you missed it all and
you're not you're oblivious to it here's
the key thing you need to know it wasn't
really about sports
like it was Sports
but damn it was something else
now and here's the the plot within the
plot
um have I ever told you that
reality tends to find the path of
greatest entertainment
and the most interesting story ends up
to be the one that happens like if you
have two potential stories but one is a
better story
the better story happens right
now if you didn't know the greatest
player of all time Lionel Messi was
playing what should be I'm sure his last
World Cup
he's won he had won everything you could
win
except the World Cup and I think
whatever is uh maybe the best player for
the World Cup or something I'm not sure
about that
um
but he won
but oh my god did the the young up and
coming who guy mabop on the other team
will probably be the best player of all
time if his Trend continues so at his as
age he's already like beating everybody
so you had the best player in the world
historically against who will be the
best player in the world if he's not
already
that new best player the young guy
scored
three goals not counting not counting a
penalty kick
you know in the at the end three goals
do you know how how unusual that is it's
happened once before
ever in the World Cup
finals
so so the guy who that the greatest
player in the world was playing against
played one of the greatest games
you could ever play three goals amazing
and tied it up at the end
and I had made the tragic mistake of
tweeting what I thought was going to be
the final
before the final you know I tweeted that
that uh reality follows the most
entertaining path and then I did hashtag
messy because it was obvious
that everything about the story needed
Messi to win and then and then the game
got tied right at the end and like oh
 oh it turns out maybe it won't
be maybe this will be the time that
reality does not go in the direction of
the the most interesting outcome
and then
Messi does this thing and you know the
the argentinians just weren't going to
let him lose here's my interpretation of
it
the battle between the two superstars
the two superstars was as good as it
could have been
but still it was the team I think it was
the argentinians who couldn't let Messi
lose
like they were fighting they were
fighting for their country they were
fighting for their own Pride they were
fighting for their family of the team
members the team members were fighting
for a lot of stuff
I'll be off this in a minute I I I see
your comments
they were fighting for a lot of things
but I feel like the main thing they were
fighting for
was they couldn't let
Messi's story end wrong
I think that's what it was about
all right I see all you Americans saying
get off this topic or it will be the
lowest attended uh video of all time all
right moving along
would you like me to talk about
something besides the World Cup
vox populi Vox Vox day
it is your vote
shall I move along all right let us not
talk about the World Cup we're done with
that forever
so Elon Musk attended the World Cup
and uh
sorry
I'm sorry there's just nothing we can do
about this
it's not my fault I swear it's not my
fault I'm just following the news
so Elon Musk was at the World Cup and
the big story is he was in the Box
hanging out with Jared Kushner of all
people
and a bunch of Saudis I guess so I'm not
sure who owned the box but he got an
invite
now
at the same time he was hanging out with
Jared Kushner he was doing a Twitter
poll asking if he should step down his
head of as CEO of Twitter
and he said that he would abide by the
decision of the Twitter poll
which of course no surprise
said he should step down a CEO
now
how do you interpret this number one do
you think he knew what the poll results
would be
probably couldn't guarantee it because
it's not scientific and who knows
probably couldn't guarantee it
probably thought it would indicate he
should step down
probably
but why would he do that why would he
leave such a big decision to a Twitter
poll
unless
he had already decided to step down
because if people said he shouldn't step
down he could just wait a couple months
and say well I took your advice but you
know nothing lasts forever now I've got
things I've got things going and now I
can step back
so if they said yes you should stay
he could make that work and still leave
right he just gives it a couple of
months and then he transitions very
normal but what if they say you should
leave right away
then do you know what he can do
exactly the same thing wait a few months
and then transition because under every
scenario he was of course planning to
wait a few months in transition that
that was the plan under every scenario
there's no scenario where he was going
to stay there and work every day who
thought that
did he think he was really going to be
the CEO
like forever
of course not so it's one of the most
brilliant things he's done lately and
you know it's pretty long list but
lately it's one of the more brilliant
things because of course he's going to
leave
that's baked into the guaranteed and and
you know end product
in the end no matter what else happens
no matter what else happens he's not
going to be the day-to-day CEO of
Twitter
who thought that was going to happen
like did anybody think that was gonna
even ever happen
so so somehow it became a story
what is the most non-story thing in the
world
but it gets better
uh
I had to pray to the simulation God's
because there's something I want to
happen
turns out the Snoop Dogg has thrown his
hat into the Twitter CEO race
by the way I don't think it's going to
be there's no way it's going to be Jared
Kushner it's not I'm not going to talk
about the possibility Jared Kushner will
run Twitter that's not going to happen
right because he's gonna have to pick
somebody
who looks Less in the bag
than somebody that political right that
there's no way that he's the right
choice
um snoop Snoop Dogg on the other hand
is about half a perfect choice
in many ways Snoop Dogg would actually
be perfect but we don't know if he'd
have the you know the day-to-day CEO
chops the the little different skill
so I suggested
that co-ceos with Martha Stewart and
Snoop Dogg maybe for a year
maybe for a year you wouldn't want it
forever
would be unbelievable
it would just be unbelievable
because
they would they would attract so much
attention you couldn't stop talking
about them and then Elon could still
keep working with the engineers to do
what he wants to do anyway
and then the the two CEOs would attract
all this attention
to Twitter which is sort of why you
needed and then
I don't know this for sure
but my my impression is that Martha
Stewart is a good operator is that you
like she could actually
um she's been CEO right she's got an
experience but I think she has the
toughness
and also the you know the mental acuity
for business
might be a great choice as long as
they're not directly involved in the
engineering you know neither neither
them would have any engineering chops
but that's what Elon does
how old is Martha Stewart I don't care
because like I said you'd only be
looking for a year and they wouldn't
they wouldn't be making engineering
decisions but you just as a face of the
company would be awesome
all right so that's not gonna happen but
it'd be fun
so the results of the polls so far are I
think it was like a 10-point lead for
uh must to step down
and the poll is already closed
but uh I don't think they've counted the
mail-in votes yet
so when the mail-in votes come
anything's possible
all right I stole that joke from Vincent
on Twitter I told him I'd have to steal
his joke it was too good yeah the
mail-in votes somebody had to say it uh
Vincent I'm glad you said it first well
Vincent is not his name he's Danny but
his account says visit as in Van Gogh
all right
now that we've done that joke we can
move on
um how many yesterday caught the
temporary dues
that must said that the the Twitter was
going to ban you if you linked to your
other platforms
so if I were to tweet
uh that you could find me on Instagram I
would be banned from Twitter
now when you saw that
did you say to yourself
well there's a rule that will change
everything
or did you say wow that's an oppressive
kind of thing I don't know if I could
live with that
all right if you had any of those
thoughts about how that was real and you
were going to have to endure it
here's what you should have said
oh he's in Rapid a b testing
he's throwing out an idea which on his
surface I mean right on his face
couldn't possibly work
I mean just think about it imagine if I
were banned from
um
linking to an account what would I do
well first of all I would reconsider
using Twitter at all
so because the the people have the the
big interesting accounts you know with
the exception of maybe
you know the Rob reiners we mostly do
this for a promotion right that's that's
a big part of why the interesting people
are on Twitter is that they're promoting
their other stuff
that's why we use it why else would we
do all this free work right now in my
case I'm all I have a you know a public
interest because I I think that
you know adding something to the public
conversation is what I want to do like
I'm at that point in my life where it's
not all about the money
but it would certainly be a blow to
Twitter's entire business model if you
took the most interesting people on
Twitter who are there just to promote
themselves and their other their other
stuff if they left
or they couldn't do it it'd be a
different product
all right so here was my reaction to it
when I saw the rule
I looked at my watch
or my phone
and I said to myself
I would be an idiot to tweet about this
because this rule is not going to last
to the end of the day
that's what I said I said this rule will
be gone by the end of today
and it was gone by
the end of the day
right
uh Paul Graham left Twitter yeah I don't
know the story there I heard he got
banned or maybe he left was it over that
it was over that issue right
I don't know but if if Paul Graham left
over that issue
um
he must I mean Paul Graham's super smart
guy he must have known that wasn't going
to last but maybe he was maybe he was
pushing it a little too
make sure it didn't last that would have
been a productive thing to do
so
so just remember you're you're in a
rapid a b testing environment
and what Elon is doing is exactly what
an entrepreneur should be doing now one
of the people who commented on Twitter
said
but why didn't he just do a little bit
of testing before he let the public know
he was even thinking about it to which I
say why would you waste that time
that that would be a waste of time
because the public is the test and it's
the only test that matters right there's
no test that matters except the actual
one what do the real people using
Twitter actually really say about it so
you just put it out there
and then you bring it back now the the
reason that people are still stuck in
the old model and by the way by
coincidence
um
Graham is who we just mentioned is I
think the inventor of the idea that you
shouldn't be doing all this testing and
Analysis when software is your primary
product
wasn't grab
that you should test fast and
and adjust because it's just software
software doesn't cost so much
it wasn't Graham
I thought he was the originator or at
least popularizer of the idea that you
should
um
they should test fast and break and move
on anyway
um
so here's what would have happened if
that had been real Let Me game it out
for you
if if uh musket meant that the very
first thing I was going to test was
linking to locals
because it wasn't mentioned specifically
so that's the first problem
it might not have been specific enough
about what is in and what is out so it
was going to fail just on specificity
like before we even got to free speech
or anything else it was just going to
fail for being a standard you couldn't
know if you were if you were doing the
right thing what would I have done
instead of putting a link
I would I would have just had Google
coffee with Scott Adams on YouTube
is starting now right now would I have
been banned
because he very specifically said no
links
but do you need a link if I tell you I'm
live go Google my name on YouTube
all right that's one suppose I included
a
suppose I put a uh what do you call it a
barcode or a
what's that thing the little square
thing that you scan what's that called
that's a
QR code suppose I put a QR code
in my tweet
could uh would Twitter detect that it
was a QR code
and what it now is a QR code that was
really a tricky link
I don't know I know
what if you just had uh created your own
page
the the only thing the page did was
connect your link tree account which is
where you put all your connections with
the algorithm find it so here's what
here's what you know could it would have
happened
you know for sure
everybody who cared would have started
gaming the system immediately
I would have I would have gamed it
immediately because you know like I
would have pushed again sad as hard as I
could push so it was it was never going
to work if you didn't see it from the
first minute
um you were probably surprised
well Schiff is back in the news
and I love the fact that Schiff said
some lies about Twitter and about Elon
Musk and elon's musk's reply I think it
was yesterday replying to Adam Schiff a
member of Congress he says Moss says
thankfully you will be losing your
chairmanship very soon your brain is too
small
your brain is too small
now
when one of the people who is generally
considered one of the smartest people in
the country
says in public your brain is too small
do you think he means that
hyperbolically
he doesn't
he means it actually literally like new
size isn't necessarily going to tell you
how smart you are but what he means is
your brain is not up to this
conversation with me
and I read it and I thought well that's
true
that's true the these two people should
never be in the same conversation
because one of them is not smart enough
to be in it
like actually literally no joke no
hyperbole it's a conversation between
two people who are not pierced and the
one who knows he's not his peer just
called them out said yeah your brain is
not big enough for this conversation
and it was just true it's just true for
this conversation shifts brain isn't big
enough yeah it's true I thought that was
perfect
and I ask you this question at what
point is it reasonable
for Twitter to put a warning on all of
schiff's tweets
all of them being the ones where he's
telling some kind of lie now the first
thing you should say is Scott you can't
police lies
on Twitter because it'd be all you do
all day
now then I say no I'm talking about a
politician they say no you can't even
police politicians because the only
thing politicians do is lie what are you
going to put a fact check on everything
Trump says it's just going to be fact
check that for fact check to which I say
I don't think Schiff lies the way
politicians lie when politicians lie
let's say Trump is your best example
he lies like a salesperson
and he lies in a way that there's
basically a wink
that you know you shouldn't take it
completely seriously when Trump says you
can't watch television if your windmill
stops turning
and he says it over and over again
do you really believe that Trump
believes that you can't watch television
when the windmill stops or that there's
no backup or anything like that no of
course he understands what he's saying
of course he knows that it's a it's a
salesman's kind of a claim he's not
going for actual truth
and you could say that about a lot of
what Twitter's what he says and I would
say you could say that about almost all
the other politicians you're Republican
Democrat they all lie and those are just
normal political Lies We Understand them
but why shift does is different
will you give me that then what whatever
it is a Schiff is doing
consistently is not like the other
people it's just different and and it's
sort of like treating jaywalking like
mass murder
oh did I did I mention that both crimes
yeah if you cross the street
um illegally you broke the law and if
you murder Andre people that's you break
those are both crimes so let's just call
them both crimes
it's the same way when you say the chef
is just lying like other people lie
that's really jaywalking compared to
murder
yeah I get it they're both lies
but they're not the same
they're not the same now here's here's
what I mean
and I don't mean that there is Mafia
talk lies or anything like that I mean
that chef
he lies as part of it what appears to be
an intelligence operation against the
public
when shift lies it doesn't look like an
ordinary lie it looks like an
intelligence operation in which he is a
key component against the interests of
the American people
now that's just my impression
right
just my impression based on experience
but I don't think we should treat these
the same I think that Twitter does a
great disservice to the public by saying
oh it's just another lie it's not
that's not just another lie do you know
why the January 6th thing is a big deal
why is that a whole big National thing
because the alleged lies about the
election are not the normal kind
there it's a whole different level of
importance right a lie about the
Integrity of the election
changes the country
is basically if it's wrong it's a
revolution now with with those claims
you have to get into what's true and
what's not it's hard to know
but but that's like a high stakes
kind of a lie if there are any lies and
of course there are always lies
so I feel like we the country and maybe
Twitter needs some way to distinguish
what's what's a ordinary Lie from a
completely unordinary lie a non-organic
non-political life
all right it says board Twitter files
that came out Matt taibi talking more
about how I guess the FBI was displeased
at one point because they believed that
Twitter had once said there was a
foreign propaganda but then they were
worried that Twitter was saying there
wasn't much foreign propaganda in the
FBI and the Intel Community were sure
there was and then why are you saying
there isn't and then Twitter's internal
Communications were we never said that
we've always said there is so it seemed
to be a miscommunication but what we
learn from it is the degree of
interaction and and the type of
interaction made it seem as if at least
some some interpreted it as Twitter
being almost a subsidiary of the FBI
that the FBI was giving them sort of
marching orders that looked like and
Twitter might comply I saw I saw it
differently because I looked at the same
documents and I saw a Roth pushing back
on the FBI and saying their their
requests were
not not appropriate and he even said if
this has been a congressional inquiry
you know that's the sort of question you
expect to see if you had this legal you
know authorized by law legal inquiry but
the FBI was just
like demanding information
and even Roth was like uh this is a
little too far A little uncomfortable
with this
so we learned a little bit more about
that interplay I don't know if that
makes much of a difference all right the
January 6 uh hoax will continue
today so today they're going to decide
um
you know what whether there be any
charges filed for Trump and maybe some
other people
now
I know there's a big big mystery here
will the people who hate Trump
and have been pushing a hoax for years
will they find any reason
to refer him for prosecution I wonder
huh I wonder
uh let's use all of our powers of mind
reading
given all the variables and all the
testimony what what would be the most
reasonable and predictable okay forget
it yeah of course they're going to
recommend them to be prosecuted
and I don't know if you're catching the
importance of this event but I tweeted
about this I'll just read my Tweet
because
there's something very important about
this that I don't know
if you've quite appreciated it goes like
this
so the January 6 committee has a very
valuable function one of them is that
they remind America and we need to be
reminded of this this is important don't
forget this
always remember that we can never again
allow a small band of unarmed protesters
to conquer the largest military power in
the history of human Civilization by
sauntering through the capital of
rotunda and taking selfies
we can never let
anybody saunter through the capital
again because we might not get lucky
next time next time the largest military
in the history of human civilization
well I can't say they're going to win a
second time okay maybe they won this one
but you can't guarantee they would win
it again so never
never again can we allow
a small group of unarmed protesters to
saunter
in the capital rotunda and take selfies
we were so close to losing everything
very close to losing everything so
people take this seriously
now if you were a Democrat you know what
you'd be saying Scott what about all
that violence
well yes there was a lot of violence
because those people wanted to what
what were they being prevented from
doing that's right sauntering right they
wanted very badly to saunter
and to take some selfies and they were
prevented and they got a little they got
a little rough and I don't I don't
approve of that I disavow all the
violence
now Scott what about the people who
actually wanted to take captives the
members of Congress well those
idiots
I'm not going to say anything good about
that that and go to jail like if
you were there if you were there to
actually hurt people you go to jail
forever
right there's no mercy no mercy to
anybody who is saying you know hang AOC
or anything like that right if anybody
that was there to hurt AOC
it doesn't matter that she's on the
other side for me politically
right if anybody who's there to hurt her
jail
and jail forever you can throw away the
 key if you went to hurt somebody
in the government
and that was like actually your plan
yeah throw in the key
all right
um so they're considering charges let's
see what are the what are their trumped
up charges uh trump top charges
um
let's see uh there's a obstruction of an
official proceeding
do you think he obstructed
an official proceeding
well isn't that what a protest is
n't the nature of a protest you're
trying to disrupt
something the government usually usually
government you're trying to disrupt
their normal operation
with your protest
um I'd like to see that one to go to the
Supreme Court
so I'm actually pretty happy that
they're going to charge it with that if
they do I don't know if the so remember
this is just recommendations this is
this these would not be charges so the
the legal system would have to decide on
charges
but wouldn't you love
to see obstruction of an official
proceeding
in the in the form of a protest would
you love that to go to the Supreme Court
I'd love to see that
because it really is can can protests be
legal in the United States because a
protest against the government is always
trying to stop them it's always you know
either by you know getting in the way or
something I mean there's always you
could always make the argument that is
trying to stop it so yeah let's let's
bang that one out I say that's a fight I
want how about you do you want that
fight
I said let's have that fight that's a
good fight yeah that would be a I would
say that would be a constructive
conflict
I I think we'd all be better off let's
fight that one out right let's it's a
friendly fight like nobody gets hurt but
let's fight that one out I'd like to see
that
what else
uh let's see uh
something about fraud or something
I don't know the other ones are doesn't
matter it doesn't matter because the
what is true and legal and right it
doesn't seem to enter into any of this
all right
um
Capital acceptor Behavior endangers oh
you're talking about the uh Ashley
Babbitt
yeah you've heard my opinion on that
all right well this has happened
um scientists have created a mini brain
in the dish and of cells and they taught
their artificially created brain to play
Pong
it actually learned in five minutes had
to operate a palm it's just it's just
brain cells in the dish
what
that's the right answer
wait did I did I miss hear this they
created a brain cell in the dish or
brain cells they put them together and
it actually now the person who did it
says that it's sentient
sentient
and other people say no it's just it's
just cause and effect and it's just
operating According to some rules
there's nothing like Consciousness
happening and I guess they're worth
they're working with some bioethicists
to make sure that they don't
accidentally
create consciousness
but do you see a problem here
do you see a problem
the problem is they already did
and and the problem is that people
Define consciousness differently
but I've always defined it this way
Consciousness is being able to predict
the effect of your actions
and then adjust
it's basically the difference between
what you think was going to happen when
you acted and then what happened so you
get that feedback oh I thought I'd do
this and I get this reaction but instead
this other reaction and that's that's
the feeling of Consciousness that's it
it's just a mechanical
conflation of two things what did I
expect to do what happened
that's Palm
that is pong
in five minutes this little clump of
cells learned that if it does this it
gets a good result if it does this it is
a bad result and it can tell the
difference that if it did what it was
supposed to do or not
consciousness
it's conscious
now do you know why you're never going
to see a major story that agrees with me
because it refutes
what
all religion
everything you thought about free will
God religion
Souls immortality the specialness of
Being Human the unique the unique
qualities of God
like everything comes in question now I
know you're some of you can say oh but
you know I can handle those questions
maybe you can
but I'm just like everything is going to
be on the table
right every
everything you thought about you know
your reality the simulation
Consciousness the most basic questions
of who the hell we are it's all up in
the air now now I thought AI was going
to do it first
I thought AI was going to achieve you
know obvious Consciousness and that
would throw us into a spin but between
the the brain and the dish
and the AI
everything's up in the air
in a way I've never I don't know if
Society
civilizations probably never been in
this position
have we
as any civilization ever been in a
position where their dominant belief
about the nature of reality got crushed
and then they had to they had to rethink
it all from scratch I doubt it's ever
happened about everything has always
happened
gradually right it would be like aliens
landing and saying oh you know you were
right we created you we're the aliens we
just came to check our work like it
would be as big as that
so I don't know what happens when that
happens
all right
how many of you believe that the world
economic Forum once said you will own
nothing and be happy
how many believe they once said that
sort of yeah sort of let's call that a
yes
would you agree
now they were they were quoting somebody
making a prediction but they put it on
their their assets so they they seem to
embrace at least by transmission
you know since they boosted the message
they they've they boosted that so we can
all agree
that that's something they really did
say
agree
that for all practical purposes
that message is theirs and they put it
out all right
let me let me do a little test for you
um do you remember when the fine people
hoax came out
and people like me were saying well oh
you just took that out of context
and and it's out of context if you saw
the full context it would reverse what
you think and what did the people
on the other side say when I said no no
just look at the full context and it
reverses the meaning
what did they say
Scott
I saw him say
the Nazis were fine people I saw it I
heard it I saw it live I saw it recorded
I'll go get you a clip I'll show it to
you again how many times do I have to
tell you he said it
he said it I heard it I saw it
end of story
do you remember when the drinking
disinfectant hoax came out
and I said people people just read his
whole statement you can see at the
beginning he's specifying its light
therapy and at the end just so there was
no confusion he specified again yeah
light light is the disinfected
so if you see the whole thing it's very
obvious that it was you know a hoax
but what did the people who say they saw
him and heard him
suggest drinking bleach what was their
defense Scott Scott
I saw it
I heard it I am the personal source for
this information don't tell me the
source is wrong I'm the source I saw it
I'm telling you I sought
right
so then uh then it would be true
would you agree that it's true that
Trump called Nazis fine people
because so many people saw it I mean
they're Witnesses right
yeah you asked the players they saw it
in live so it must be true
well it's not true because you saw the
contest of course it's not true and then
about the bleach thing lots of witnesses
they saw it with their own eyes heard it
with their own ears except didn't happen
right
now
let's get back to the wef
the WF wants to make sure that you have
no uh personal ownership of anything in
the future apparently because this
statement you will own nothing and be
happy about it that's very clearly
saying and I think we all saw it with
our own eyes
and we heard it with our own ears
they're very clearly saying that
capitalism will be ended except that
maybe the rich people will own things
and the rest of you are just
have to rent and they're going to own
your ass because you won't have anything
and and if you want to rent well you
better be good to the the leaders
right now we know that's what they meant
that they want to take away capitalism
and consolidate power with the elites so
that you can do nothing but rent some
shed and be happy about it
that's right so that's what they meant
because you all saw it and you all heard
it yourself right
would you agree tell just agree with me
that that's what they said you heard it
you saw it there's no doubt about it yes
right
and you're not at all influenced by the
context of knowing that the other side
believes they saw things that weren't
real
but do you do you believe that you're
susceptible to that
does anybody here think that they could
be fooled
the same way the the left was fooled by
thinking they actually saw something
like really obvious
like I saw it with my own eyes you don't
tell me it didn't happen
did does anybody think that that could
have happened with this world economic
Forum quote that maybe you saw that in
context
all right here's some context some of
you didn't see in the same I think there
was one video where they highlighted
that prediction for here's the first
thing did you know the prediction is
just one person
it was just like one person made a
prediction
and then they they put it together with
some other materials so they did boost
it certainly they boosted it but it's
one person this prediction
it wasn't a preference
it was a prediction
and what was the one example that was
given they they gave a visual example of
what it means to own nothing and be
happy did you see the example
the example was a drone delivers your
Amazon package
but you just use it because let's say
it's a tool that you only needed to use
once
so Amazon delivers your unique tool you
use it once is rented and then the Drone
takes it back for the next person
so that would be a little bit like
leasing the car
or renting a car
has anybody ever rented a car
was that communism or was at the end of
capitalism because you didn't own it you
were just a renter no that was just you
in a free market and that was better for
you free market
flashlight I see your comment and I'm
not going to say anything more about it
all right so here's another example Uber
I don't own the Uber
but I'm happy when it comes and takes me
somewhere
am I not happy oh I'm very happy that I
don't own that Uber now here's what
people said when I brought this up they
said Scott you're missing the plot
they didn't say some special tools will
be rented
like that's no big deal they said
everything
right you saw it with your own eyes you
heard it with your own ears they didn't
say everything
I mean they act like you wouldn't own
anything
that's different isn't it that's like
getting get a rid of capitalism
so that's what they meant right because
they said it very clearly you'll own you
know you won't own anything so they must
have meant it
right
have you ever seen a fashion show
remember when I was a little kid I'd
watch fashion shows or news reports
about fashion shows when I was a kid and
there'd be like some model who would
come out and her so-called dress would
be made from license plates
or like the pull tabs from a beer can
or the dress would be made of tin foil
right or sticky notes
and do you remember what um when I was a
kid I'd be there with my family and
let's say none of us were sophisticated
viewers of media we were not
sophisticated viewers do you know what
we said when we sat in that living room
watching that
we said my God
how could the people who put on this
show be so dumb to think that somebody's
going to want to wear you know buy and
wear a licensed play dress
I am so smart at nine years old that
even at nine years old I already know
more than these adults who are putting
on this fashion show with clothing that
clearly nobody's gonna buy and I'm only
nine years old and I know it and I know
I'm smart because my mother and father
are laughing too and they're saying the
same thing they're saying oh God why did
they think anybody's going to wear that
like I I if I see that in the story I
don't think I'm going to pick up a
license plate dress
and then I got older
and I learned how the world works
and I learned that the fashion show
has very little to do with what they
think you might want to buy and wear
they're just getting attention
the license plate dress just so you'll
watch and so the news will cover it
it's just to put their name out there
and you remember them and has nothing to
do with what you're going to wear right
when the wef put out that prediction
remember it was a prediction
what is the purpose of a prediction in
let's say our modern world
when somebody puts out a prediction what
is the purpose of the prediction
is it a preference
if somebody if somebody does a climate
change prediction
is that because they want the planet to
burn up
now predictions are not preferences
right would you agree that a prediction
is not a preference
right but the way the wef packaged that
prediction they did package it like a
preference didn't they
they packaged it like it was their
preference so that's the scary part
but I I share their preference
am I scary
I have the same preference the only
thing that's different between my exact
opinion which doesn't bother you at all
hey I'd like to be able to rent a car in
the future
no problem I'd like to have a special
tool that I could rent instead of Buy
you don't have a problem with that the
problem is the anything right where all
of your stuff
is gone that's the scary part
but that's that's the fashion show part
the reason that that kind of a
prediction is stated as as a absolute
is why why is the prediction as an
absolute
it's the same reason that the fashion
show has license plate dresses
that's why you pay attention it's only
the absolute that makes you pay
attention suppose they had put it in
more less less provocative terms
in the future the current trend of
renting things that are you know don't
make sense to own will increase
does that does that get your juices
running oh the current Trend will
continue
and everybody will be happy about it
because the only way the trend would
continue would be if the free market
wanted it
so basically the WF made a total of free
market prediction
the free market all of you are going to
like a situation where there's a lot of
stuff you can rent instead own
but because they put it in absolute it
got your attention
if you're a sophisticated viewer of the
news you would know that the absolute
part was just to get your attention
when Trump says they're not sending
their best
across the border
is he trying to suggest that all people
who come across a border are criminals
of course not but by but by treating it
like it's a little bit closer to an
absolute than it really is what did it
do and got everybody talking about it
got attention made him president of the
United States
so be aware
that in the context of a fashion show or
a prediction
these are intended to be attention
getters
they're intended as attention getters
that's different if you know them as
attention getters then you just you sort
of ignore them so when I saw it I was
like oh we'll rent more stuff in the
future
that was it that's all I saw
I saw one statement that says oh we're
going to rent more stuff in the future
that sounds cool that's it
and what do those of you who still
disagree with me on my interpretation
say
what is your argument
I heard it with my own ears I saw it
with my own eyes
don't be Democrats
that's what the Democrats are doing
they're acting like that standard makes
sense in 2022. in 2022 you should never
say I know it's true because I saw it or
I heard it
it's the worst thing you could say it
just it just
it out you as somebody who hasn't
watched the news with any sophistication
because most of the news is fake why
would you think this is the real one
all right now I'm going to take it to
the next level
was there something about this
that your detector should have
picked up right away
because people say Scott how do you know
that your interpretation is correct so
let me tell you why I believe my
interpretation is correct
number one could I be wrong of course
so the first thing you want to look for
is somebody who said well I could be
wrong I've been wrong before
so if somebody if somebody presents
something as an absolute
they're already not credible
the only people you should believe about
anything are people say I'm almost
positive about this but you know I could
be wrong it could be some surprise here
those are more credible right
next thing you need to know is that
most of the time I spend talking in
public is about areas which are not my
area of expertise
would you agree mostly mostly I talk
about stuff in the news I'm no expert
I'm just talking about it this happens
to be one thing I'm an expert on
I'm an expert at looking at people's
words
written and spoken and understanding
them in context do you know why because
that's my job
that's literally my job you can't be a
writer unless you're thinking as a
viewer and a reader and a writer at the
same time when I'm writing
I'm thinking what how are you seeing it
like do I need to add some context is
something missing is some implied is
there enough there so the the question
of can you read something and have good
reading comprehension is simply not
something that you all have
that's not an insult
that's just a statement that I do it for
a living and you don't right if there's
something you do for a living and I
don't
it would be fair to say it's almost
certain that you do it better than I do
because you do it for a living
duh I do this for a living
I do this exactly this for a living
I I've demonstrated commercial grade
ability
to write and form words in context that
a large number of people will understand
correctly
so when I look at the sentences and I
say the correct interpretation is
probably this
and you don't have the skill that I have
a demonstrated commercial ability
to put words together in understandable
ways if you don't have that you should
listen to me now does that mean that I'm
right
no
because remember the thing that makes me
credible or it should is that I never
say I'm absolutely 100 right nothing
could be wrong right those people you
don't listen to at all
just ignore all of them
those are not they're not even trying
all right what else was there anything
else about this they should have jumped
out as uh that it's
yes there is
they're really test
did none of you do the really test on
this
all right let's do the really test and
if if you're new to it you'll you'll
pick it up pretty quickly
all right so the world economic forum
you say just is telling the world
directly and clearly that we want to
take away your ability to own things
like have private ownership
and and they believe that uh even though
maybe people on the right would not
appreciate this so much they do believe
that Democrats let's say mainstream
Democrats are going to embrace this as a
good thing
now do you believe
that the members of the wef
don't want people to own things
really
really
now let's take a little further do you
think the members of the wef could be
better described as collaborators
or competitors
go the the members of the wef the the
big Elites are they competitors with
each other
or are they colluders and they're
looking for the like a collective
conspirators you say they're
conspirators
no they're both they're both if you
don't get that you're missing the whole
story
do you think that the head of one car
company is colluding with the head of
the other car company maybe in some
minor way but they would also like to
destroy that other competitor right
they don't act like one thing
so let me ask you this do you think all
those Elites they all agreed that they
don't want to sell stuff anymore they
only want to rent new stuff do you think
that happened do you think you do you
think really do you think you put a
bunch of Elites together
and the and while some of those Elites
surely would have benefited from a
rental
Society surely you don't think there
were plenty other Elites who said holy
 we only sell stuff that's all we're
going to do in the future we just want
to keep selling cars keep selling
Caterpillar tractors like I where are
The Selling Stuff business we're not in
the rental business
you don't think anybody at the wef
wants ownership private ownership really
really you could take a bunch of Elites
from the world and they would agree that
none of those Elites in the future will
sell you stuff that you own
that is insane
right just just check your own thinking
about this it would literally be insane
to imagine that any group of Elites
would agree collectively that they won't
sell things you could own
there's no world in that which that can
happen
I will agree there's some of them in the
room would say oh my business will be
better
with a lot of renting but even that
person doesn't want the rest of you to
be renting everything even if you
thought your business would be better
with rental in the future
you don't think the world is better with
rental
literally nobody with any economic sense
has that point of view
so you imagine if you believe that the
WF really meant this as some evil thing
you imagine that they said this right
out loud
with no hesitation
oh you won't own anything in the future
and you'll be happy about it because
that's what we're going to make happen
with our Elite manipulation
do you really believe that I want to see
if anybody will say yes I believe that
happened
good
say it say yes you believe that happened
so one yes
two yes three yes
all right
well here's what we've proven
people will believe anything
would you agree
and when you see the people on the other
side say I saw it with my own eyes I
heard it with my own ears those of you
who said yes to this you should start
believing them because they are you
you're now the fine people hoax you're
now the drinking bleach chokes you're
the same people to to imagine that
you're on the other side politically
would be inaccurate you're actually the
same people
because the people who believe what
they're told
in that way
they're not really like part of decision
making
are they
they're just confused
I'm not sure you should treat them like
other people have actual opinions that's
just being confused
now you can own simple things such as
property
exactly
exactly
the free market
will will will make a much clearer
distinction between the things that make
sense to own and the things that won't
make sense to own that's exactly right
that's what the wef is saying it's what
I say and it's what any Economist says
everybody says the same thing the free
market will decide what makes sense to
own and what makes sense to rent as they
always have
as they always have
do you know why rental makes more sense
in the future
I'm the perfect example here's why
rental will make more sense in the
future I own a lot of
right I got a house that's full of
I Got A Car
a few bicycles right I got a lot of
is all broken
all of it it all requires maintenance
there's not one thing in my house that
isn't a little bit broken
if I rented this stuff it'd all be fixed
because I would just call whoever made
and say hey it's broken again come fix
it and they say that's our job they come
fix it
right everything that is a problem in my
day-to-day life would be fixed by having
at least the big stuff
rented
as long as long as the price was good
right if it costs more then that's a
different decision but if they could get
the economics so that renting it makes
more sense I mean owning something with
a maintenance contract is that different
from renting
what about my house now my house would
be a perfect example of something that
makes more sense to own for some people
and for other people it makes more sense
to rent
so
the the mark the free market will just
decide but there'll be more of both
now I heard somebody say that I have to
understand the uh
uh you'll owe nothing be happy in the
larger context of the wef because you
say they're an evil organization with a
whole bunch of leftist crazy ideas and
this is just another one so if you
looked at all their other crazy ideas
suddenly this one looks like it's right
in the pocket right oh I see somebody
great all right so let's say that I
agree with you all that the Wes uh let's
say climate change agenda
is not your idea of a good idea
agree
like you don't like that part but does
that tell you that they don't want
private ownership
it was not really connected
I can't imagine the Klaus Schwab wants
to not own anything in the future
um
do I think my rental company will do
better yes
because the free market would
um weed out the ones who don't do better
maybe not on day one but that's what the
market does
yeah
um
now people said Scott
uh Klaus wants a world in which only the
rich people can own stuff and the poor
people have to rent
what do you think of that comment
Klaus wants a situation where the red
the rich people own stuff
but the poor people rent
now that would be a world you don't want
to live in right can't we agree you
don't want to live in a world in which
the rich people own stuff
and the poor people ju this is their
only option they just gotta rent
okay we all agree nobody wants to live
in that world
I want to see your comments
we all agree we don't want to live in a
world where the rich people own stuff
and the poor people have to rent because
they don't have a choice right yeah
uh I'm sorry to do this to you but you
know you live in that world now right
I have a feeling that some of you are
being quiet because you knew this was a
trick you knew this was a trick right
that's exactly the world you live in
how does a poor people poor people don't
own anything poor people take the bus
poor people rent their house
they don't anything they own the food
before they put it in their mouth
and even they don't even own that that's
probably just given to them right
how did you miss the fact that you live
in the capitalist Society capitalism
is exactly what you just described the
capitalists own stuff
the poor people have to rent it
that is your current situation
so you're actually you're afraid of a
future that's exactly like the president
that doesn't bother you at all
now is that unfair
well lots of people say yes
but it is also true that those poor
people can find a path to be rich people
and own stuff and rent it to poor people
so the only thing that keeps our system
together
is that there are enough poor people
going from poor to owning stuff that
people see as possible
and if it's possible and you see enough
people doing it you say to yourself oh
maybe the problem's Me Maybe the system
works because people are rising through
the system but if I'm not Rising through
the system well maybe it's my own damn
fault which I do think people believe
yeah how many citizens own their own
farmland
right if if
Farmland was owned only by small farmers
would you be able to eat
I don't know how
probably not I mean maybe yes but it'd
be tough I mean it's the corporate Farms
that probably made it efficient enough
that everybody can get fed
right so in many cases you think you
have a political disagreement or you
think that you're hearing something
differently but I would argue that the
people who have a good economic training
are all on my side
you want to test that
Let's test that Let's test it
all right so stop answering other
questions for a moment I'm going to ask
you one question you have to identify
yourself as somebody who's trained in
business and economics only only
people who are trained in business and
economics I want you to tell me that
I've correctly
um
so give me your credentials and then
tell me that you agree with my
interpretation of this situation go
and just watch the comments so what
you're going to see is it's not a
difference of opinion it's a difference
of training
there's a difference of trading right
yeah if this were a situation that was
outside of my field because remember
economics and business are actually my
field that's what I'm trained for
so to be as obvious
but it's not obvious because I'm smarter
than you that's not what's happening
it's not obvious because I like read an
extra article
is obvious because my background is
exactly in this area exactly in this
area right if your background is not in
this area it just looks like a scary
bunch of
so I get that like if you didn't have
that that specific background it would
look scary as yet and I if I didn't have
this background I might interpret it the
same way you are I might
all right you see how quiet it got
I believe everybody with economics and
business uh background agreed with me
I didn't see it I didn't see an
exception did you
now that's why you should if you
disagree with me just take that's the
only takeaway right I won't try to
change your mind
I just want you to be aware that people
have similar expertise around the same
page
doesn't mean we're all right right okay
we agree that doesn't mean all the
people with the right training are right
we've seen examples where the smart
people were all wrong
but but take it all into consideration
look look at the bigger picture
all right so knowing of course knowing
of course that I could never change your
mind
that doesn't happen
have I changed anybody's mind about how
much they should worry about that
statement
you go
look at the other comments too so you
can see what's up so a number of people
said yes and and then a number of people
say no the no's were first the first
answers were no's no no no no no no no
now if you say no
how do you interpret all the yeses
what's your interpretation of the yeses
do you think I fooled them with my
persuasion
or do you think that adding new
information or new context legitimately
changed their mind what do you think is
going on
don't even think about me for a second
just think about the other people who
are with you your peers and and look at
them changing their mind
not all of them
but a bunch of them
how do you interpret that
do you think that they're uh they've
been hypnotized or do you think that
they're dealing with the facts
yeah I think this is a perfect example
of uh how hard it is to change anybody's
mind
and would you agree that this was the
perfect setup
to test the limits of that
because the people who are watching me
on live stream generally the reason
you're watching is that you you find
them credible
right
that's the only reason I have an
audience is that some number of people
find me credible
now
if you find me credible and you listen
to the argument and you saw nothing to
disagree with
you'd have to ask yourself why people
are are still dug in all right but let
me give you another
small therapeutic doses of cognitive
distance that's exactly what it is and
so you can feel it
you know I don't think you really
understand cognitive dissonance until
you find a situation where you
definitely were in it and didn't know it
does anybody had that experience yet
where your own cognitive distance
becomes clear to you you're like oh man
I thought that was true for 30 years
only to find out was all wrong it's very
disconcerting right yeah just keep that
in mind when you're looking at this
situation because if you see somebody
who's
who's on your side
and when you agree I'm on your side
let me ask you that first
would you agree that I'm on your side if
you're you know a law-abiding American
citizen and if you're a law-abiding
citizen of another country I probably
like you a lot too
yeah I'm totally out of your side all
right so I'm on your side
you're watching my live stream because
you find me credible
you heard the entire argument and I
don't think any context has not been
mentioned I think all all important
context on all sides I think have been
mentioned
and that but if that doesn't change your
mind
you might you might have for the first
time identified your own cognitive bias
little bubble now if that's happening to
you
you could have like a real moment here
like it's really going to be like a big
day for you the first time you really
experience it oh
I only believe this because I was I know
in my little bubble or whatever
as soon as you have that first
experience you're free
because you only have to have it once
and you'll remember it forever and it
will make you a lot more humble the next
time you're sure you're right
and that could be good for you
all right can you believe there's still
somebody here mocking me
for allegedly acting like I'm always
right
is that the most counter factual thing
in the whole world
literally nobody says they're wrong more
clearly and often than I do
I I will put myself as the number one
person on the planet who admits
he's wrong
specifically why and I don't even wait
very long I give it to you as soon as
soon as it's obvious
and remember the reason I can do that
like I have a special Channel where I
can be wrong like aggressively
vigorously wrong and it doesn't hurt me
you know why
because I've set up that expectation
the expectation is I'm going to follow
the data
and when I do that you go okay you
followed the data changed his mind
that's how it's supposed to work
so I would not feel diminished by being
wrong I would feel bolstered it's
actually a reframe if you think about it
that's a reframe I've reframed being
wrong
from being a sense of Shame
to an accomplishment
better write that down because I
I've got a book that I need to put that
in
ah
a lot of these reframes are sort of like
they're baked into your life
what did I just say
you're gonna rephrase being wrong
being wrong as as an accomplishment
being wrong in public is an
accomplishment
not a shade
if you think it's going to be a shame or
like some kind of Mark against you
that's what triggers you into cognitive
distance
so you can actually create a situation
where you guarantee you will not see the
world correctly
because if you have a shame based
operating system oh I can't I can't be
seen as wrong
I can never be seen as wrong that
guarantees you that you will be wrong
because the the I can't be ashamed by
being wrong is the trigger for cognitive
distance oh I can't be wrong oh darn the
data says I am
I can't change to the data because that
would be a shame
too embarrassing so instead I will I
have my brain reinterpret the data as
not credible
how about how about we'll discount that
data so that's cognitive distance now
why am I immune
I'm immune
from that trigger not nobody's 100
immune but you can you can work toward
immunity
by taking shame and embarrassment out of
your life
once those are gone
and you realize that you're a person who
can get stuff wrong
pretty easily like even if you think
you're pretty smart you can still think
that
but smart people get ordinary things
wrong all the time it's completely
ordinary
so I don't have anything that will
violate my sense of self do you get that
cognitive dissonance happens when
something about your sense of self gets
violated
if I find out I did something uh
stupidly wrong in public
that's content for my show and then I'll
get on here and talk about how stupid I
was and why I got it wrong and then
we'll all learn something
to be it's just content
so if you can if you can convert your
shame into content you will be not
completely
but very very much protected
from the cognitive dissonance trigger
I'll bet that's advice you've never
heard before
has anybody ever heard anything like
that
is that the most like oh yeah okay
that's I feel like that's the most out
of the box
life advice you've ever heard and also
the most useful
is probably nothing more useful than
that if you can nail it
I heard somebody the other day talking
about
it was a success story I forget who it
was but they called out their lack of
embarrassment as a superpower
and I feel like that's behind all uh
celebrity superstars
they have to be able to handle that yeah
is the perfect example you have to be
free from embarrassment or you don't get
too far
because that's what stops people oh I'll
be embarrassed if I try that
uh Trump makes 10 every time an nft is
traded yeah I got confirmation some
people seem to know for whatever reason
is it because it's on the Open Sea
does it actually list it or you knew it
somehow
by the way that's the normal thing that
people do is put a 10 kicker on any sale
of an nft
so
all right
uh
renting would not allow this well I do
think that no matter how big renting
gets they'll as long as the free market
has people who also want to buy you
should always be able to buy
because remember the wef is not opposed
to free markets
and the free market will find you
because you're not alone right so it
doesn't matter if we go you know from 90
ownership to 10 ownership and the rest
is least
everybody who wants to buy
will be accounted for because the free
market meets needs that's how it works
so it might not be on day one but but
eventually everybody gets what they want
in a rough sense
you rent beer yeah
rent is an illusion you're a caretaker
for Time same as a feudal system yeah
I'm open to that argument that a lot of
this is word play
in a sense yeah
all right I'm going to say goodbye to
YouTube
and I'm gonna go talk to the locals
people privately a little bit here
subscription service so they get the
extra good stuff
bye for now YouTube
