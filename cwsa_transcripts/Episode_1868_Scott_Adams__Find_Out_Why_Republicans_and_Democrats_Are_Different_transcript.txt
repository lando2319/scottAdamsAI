foreign
good morning everybody
and welcome
to one of the highlights of your entire
life and
I think it'll be special for me too
if you think that yesterday was good
well hahaha you
today even better and wait for tomorrow
tomorrow haul
tomorrow is going to be amazing
but let's uh think about that while we
have a copper among our glass of tank
which also Stein the canteen jug of
flask a vessel of any kind that we will
fill with our favorite liquids I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it's coming at you now go
ah it's like knowledge and love
all on the same step
you can barely tell which is the
knowledge and which is the zip
well I was happy uh yesterday watching
on the five as Greg gotfeld was
talking about and I think didn't Trump
say something about this that the only
way to handle the homeless problem is to
get them out of the Cities
there's plenty of space there must be
government land there must be a farmer
who wouldn't mind
you know using the land and just let
them camp
because
the public is largely not under the
impression
that well the public largely thinks that
the problem is they don't have a house
but the real problem is they don't want
to be in a house
so let them live the life they want to
live do their drugs sleep in tents
um and let them have the life they want
but away from the people who want a
different life
and it made me wonder
is that where we're heading with
Democrats and Republicans where we'll
just have a country where
eventually you have a purely Republican
state and a purely Democratic State and
they look real different
are we heading to that we might be
um
anyway there's literally no other
solution for the homeless
would you agree
would you agree that there's literally
no other solution for the homeless the
ones that want to be outside you have to
keep them outside just move them away
from the the businesses that they're
destroying
and yeah and Trump said that as well now
why is why would that even be
controversial
can you think of her is it
because I'm assuming that whatever
Support Services exist in the cities
could be you know ported out
I don't know I don't really understand
uh well yeah Chaz was a problem because
they tried to take over other people's
place
um do you know
what would be he be physicist an
astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson Dyson
you all know him famous
I guess astronomer scientist
I saw a little reel on him in which he
was explaining why he used to believe we
were a simulation
like Elon Musk explains but he's decided
that we're not
and I want you to hear a scientist's
description
of why logically
we are not a simulation
and then you have to decide
has he debunked the simulation
or is that as he debunked scientists are
smart
one of those two things is going to get
debunked now you ready
either the simulation Theory will be
just destroyed
or I will show that famous scientists
are really not that bright really not
that bright
here's his argument
that the simulation would assume that if
ever there was a real a real
civilization that built a simulation
that that simulation would eventually
build its own simulation
and so it would be simulation on top of
simulation and the odds of us being an
original simulation
the original species are very low so
that's the argument before the
simulation
here's uh Neil Degrassi's Dyson's
argument why he no longer thinks that's
reasonable
and he doesn't believe it because he
says we can't build a simulation right
now
so we must be the original
because we can't do it
or were the last
now if we're the last one meaning that
for some reason we're a simulation that
doesn't know how to make a simulation
that still allows that we're a
simulation so the first the first error
in his reasoning is when he says we're
either the first meaning an original
species or we're the last simulation
if we're the last simulation were a
simulation
so his own argument
that he doesn't believe in the
simulation because it's possible that we
are one
it doesn't even make sense
there are two possibilities and we
already knew there were two
possibilities We Are One or we're not
and then part of his argument is well we
are one or we're not
those were the options before
the next one is the and then the other
part is that we can't build a simulation
now
imagine a scientist saying that that we
can't build a simulation that believes
it's
a simulation
I could write that code myself
like actually literally I could write
code
that's a code that describes an entity a
person
and then whenever it's asked the
question are you real
it will say I'm totally real
yeah I'm real
and then I won't be able to tell from
the outside whether it has any internal
thoughts
but it's going to look like a simulation
to me
you tell me we can't build that
simulation now what about the better
simulation where the simulation actually
believes
believes it's real we could totally make
that
the the reason that people think we
can't make a simulation
that where the simulation believes is
real
is always based on Magic
humans have magic inside them
and therefore it's impossible to program
something that also has magic in it like
Free Will of a soul and a spirit
magic basically
so no if you start with the Assumption
I'm a scientist who believes in magic
and now let me tell you why we can't be
a simulation
that's not a logical argument
and next he assumes that if we can't
make a simulation right now
that we must be an original species
but wouldn't even the simulation have to
wait a while before it built the
simulation
the day of simulation is created
do we create it at exactly the moment it
can make another simulation
or do we create a simulation that has to
evolve the way we evolved
at least a little bit before it could
make a simulation so none of his
argument makes any sense
it does open the possibility that we're
not a simulation but it doesn't it
doesn't
there's no logical
cohesion to the argument at all
so what do you think is the answer to
the question and independent from
whether we're a simulation
so I'm only talking about whether his
argument is good not whether it's true
or false is the argument good
it doesn't look like a good argument to
me
so that worries me a little bit
so the immigrants being shipped by bus
to Martha's Vineyard so that the lefties
can figure out what to do with all the
immigrants who are coming in continues
to be hilarious
continues to be hilarious
and uh the more you watch
the Democrats complained the funnier it
gets
and I don't think they realize that the
more they complain
the more the Republicans like it
because they don't have anything
all they have is you're playing pawns
with human lives
you're playing pawns by taking and
shipping them to a nice place now
Martha's Vineyard says the problem is we
don't have
a social infrastructure that can handle
these people
and then what do the Republicans say
you mean just like Texas
you mean just like Arizona
you mean just like California
that's the whole point
if all of those States had plenty of
resources to take care of them we
wouldn't even be talking about it the
whole point is that nobody has the
resources and yeah we get that you can't
handle a busload of 150
and maybe Texas as a state maybe they
can handle thousands or hundreds of
thousands that's true but in both cases
there's a limit to how many they can
take
maybe Martha's vineyard's limit is 150.
could be
maybe Texas is limited as a few hundred
thousand per year
but they both have a limit
if you act like there's no limit to what
anybody can handle you're just being a
 idiot everybody's got a limit so
welcome to your limit Martha's Vineyard
you just found your limit
just the fact that it's smaller than
somebody else's limit
doesn't mean anything
it just means you both can't do it
that's all it means
um have you noticed this it's hard to
miss it but every time Republicans and
Democrats disagree not every time this
isn't complete absolute but it seems
like there's a consistent pattern
the Republicans are focusing on fixing
inefficient systems
let's say the immigration system
and Democrats are focused on killing the
messenger
so
Republicans are trying to defeat a bad
system to replace it with something more
efficient usually something free market
something that has fewer fewer
regulations
and while they're trying to do that
which presumably would be good for
everybody
the Democrats entire job is to say that
the Republicans are racist Hitler
it's so different isn't it we're not
really even talking about what system
works well are we
there's no conversation about what
system works better there's only
conversation that one group is Nazis
one group has an idea for fixing things
and the other group says that group is
Nazis that's it
all they have is frightening you about
how their character and their
preferences are going to be scary for
you if they get power
and somehow we act like we can't notice
this
maybe we should notice that only one
side is even talking about governing the
other side isn't even talking about
governing yeah I mean it doesn't seem
like it it's basically even when they
Implement a system
the system is to insult the other people
right so critical race Theory you could
say to yourself okay Scott that's
Democrats trying to improve the system
but they've improved the system with the
express point of insulting Republicans
basically right so even their systems
are built to insult other other
residents
really you're building a system to shoot
other Messengers and insult other
people well the Republicans are just
trying to make things efficient so
everybody can use it
all right
likewise even though nobody says this
directly it seems as if
Republicans think that money is created
by hard work
and smart risk taking
is that fair Republicans believe that
money is created
out of nothing
by hard work I mean that's not nothing
and of hard work and the right kind of
risk-taking you know entrepreneurial
risk taking
and Democrats believe that all the money
that's ever that will ever be created
has already been made
and somebody has theirs
if they can only get their fair share
from the people who worked hard and took
intelligent risks
then everybody be in good shape
and somehow
somehow
it the election is close
according to erasmussen the uh the
midterms are now a dead Heat
between the generic Republican and the
you know I think it's like one point
difference but it's lost in the rounding
there's basically no difference now
literally one side their entire message
is let's see how badly we can insult
these other people who are in our
country that one side is working on
systems Improvement
and
it's a tie
it's a die
so there's your country
uh the funniest story of the day is that
Don Lemon is being moved by CNN from his
evening program
to a Morning Show
I would like to give you my impression
of Don Lemon explaining that his
movement from a show in which he would
get half a million viewers
to a show in which he would be one of
three hosts getting 125 000 viewers
and being completely taken out of the
political argument by being put on the
morning
when it's a different audience
now here's my impression of Don Lemon
explaining last night
that it's really a promotion
um yeah Yeah well yeah I had a choice I
totally I totally could have said no and
uh it looks like a great opportunity and
I'm totally no people say I'm being
devoted no no no no not being devoted
it's like I'm being promoted in a way if
you think about it like in a way it's
like a promotion can I get that morning
show that I've always been wanting but I
never mentioned before
and watching him do it
was hilarious but here's the
best part you ready for the best part
I'm trying to imagine the new CEO Chris
like light I think this is I I don't
know how to pronounce his name l-i-c-h-d
licked light
don't know
but I'm trying to imagine the new CEO
planning how he's going to tell
Don Lemon that he'd like to move him to
the morning
and then he realizes that the CEO
realizes away
Don lemon's the guy who believes every
hoax that's ever been offered
he literally believes anything
so
the CEO told him he was getting
promoted
and he believed it
so how do you demote somebody
who who believes every hoax every hoax
you tell them they got promoted
and he can't tell the difference
the entire reason he's getting demoted
is he can't tell the difference between
good news and bad news am I right
he's a guy who by by our observation is
clearly obvious that he can't tell
what's true and what isn't he doesn't
know the difference between good news
and bad
so if you have an employee who don't
doesn't know the difference between good
news and bad news you don't really need
to worry about demoting them
because they'll think it was a promotion
if you tell them it was
I don't think anything could be funnier
than that using Don lemon's own Gull
ability to demote him into thinking he
got promoted
I'm sorry
I will never be more entertained than by
that story
all right
um
apparently Politico
has new German ownership that wants it
to shift toward actual news and away
from being hyper partisan left
so now Politico is moving to the center
and CNN is trying to move to the center
we'll see is that a is that some kind of
a shift we'll see
uh Biden trotted out the fine people
hoax again and he's and he's
highlighting it again he didn't just
Trot it out he's highlighting it
the most easily debunked hoax of all
hoaxes you simply have to just read the
transcript that's it and it's debunked
there's no extra explanation needed
nothing just look at the transcript oh
okay they left out that part if you
don't leave it out it says the opposite
of what you said is it that's it and
and the and the Democrats have so
thoroughly succeeded in brainwashing at
least their people
that they can highlight it as a central
theme years after it's been debunked
thoroughly
and their their viewers can't tell the
difference
the Democrat base
actually has no access to anything like
reality because otherwise you couldn't
do this you could never get away with
this if if Democrats had access to the
news
am I right
how could you possibly get away with
this if if Democrats had access to the
news
now here's the real test CNN because I
know you're watching
there's definitely somebody from CNN
watching this
if you didn't know that the fine people
thing was a hoax go look at the full
transcript in it's easy to see yourself
or you can just Google find people hoax
and you'll see lots of people debunking
it including me
Now CNN says that it's pivoting toward
real news
do you think that those remaining a CNN
would be able to debunk the fine people
hoax under the new management
could they just say he didn't say that
here's what he actually said and then
just read his actual quote
could they do it could Politico do it
or maybe they have I don't know Politico
might have
so this is a question for CNN
if Sia then wants to prove
that they're serious
they have to debunk the fine people hoax
anything short of debunking that
means that CNN was never serious never
serious about finding the middle
because that's just the fact that that
was a hoax
yeah and the the bleach thing too but
the bleach thing at least at least they
have some torture or argument why
they're really right even though they're
obviously wrong
but with the fine people hoax you just
have to read the transcript it's right
there in plain language
if they can't debunk that one they're
not serious about being a real News
Network
well over in uh
Ukraine
uh five Russian installed officials
meaning I guess that means
probably Ukrainian people that were
Russian puppets
but five of them were killed in the
occupied Ukrainian territory now they
weren't all together
so there were five different
assassinations
of people working with Russia to keep
occupied
and let me read to you about the Russian
military successes on the ground
you've heard that Russia's sense of
missiles and taking out a bunch of
infrastructure in Ukraine but have you
heard about the news about the Russian
military on the ground and all of their
successful
military actions in the last couple of
weeks
what no you haven't heard the news about
the Russian successes on the ground
there there haven't been any
as far as I can tell has it been
how many weeks when was the last time
Russians had anything like an increase
in territory
three weeks
five weeks
but they've been losing territory for
two weeks
oh today was there something happening
today
oh the Wagner group is surrounding uh
Bak mutt in Don Bass
are you saying that the ukrainians are
in the dunbas that would mean that
they've already pushed into there
uh the entire Ukrainian offensive is now
trapped behind flood waters from the dam
oh that now that would be interesting
because part of the news was that Russia
took out a dam
was that strategic was that a
battlefield strategy or just punishing
if that was a battlefield strategy and
it trapped the Ukrainian
wow
it's both
wow did the dam take out any military
when it broke
forces are now stranded on the East Bank
oh my goodness so that's today's news
right
yeah I didn't see that I didn't see that
in the news so I guess the only place
you can get news like that is
um Twitter and telegram right
interesting
so now now things are going to get
interesting
but
but have the Russians retaken any
territory
so it sounds like they're trying
they Swept Away the pontoon bridges
uh the Don bass is like the South and
the USA
it's been news for a few days
does it seem like the regular news has a
little blackout on Ukraine
or or they just don't know what's
happening is that what's happening they
don't have as much original reporting
because I'm not sure we can believe
anything
all right well I'll go read up on the uh
the updates in Ukraine but I'm going to
stick with my prior statement
that although the Russians may have done
something strategically good they have
not yet
changed the nature of the war
so we'll see
maybe they will
um you know I saw the story about the
maybe it was the Wagner group who were
using Russian prisoners as recruits
and saying you know there's a video I
don't know if it's real it looked
realish
but the uh they were saying hey you
Russian prisoners you can get out of
jail if you go fight for six months
um
and this raises an interesting question
are not all of the military in the
Russian army at the moment prisoners
because what what does it mean to be a
prisoner
you're still a prisoner if you're
working the Chain Gang right
if you're doing cleanup on the side of
the highway you're still a prisoner
even though you're not in the Cell at
that moment
but if you don't have a choice
and you're not fighting for anything
that's to your benefit such as defending
your own country
aren't you just a prisoner
if you're in the military because if you
don't want to be in the military but you
can't leave
and you're not fighting for something
that's in your benefit
you know just like the prisoners
cleaning up the trash on the road
they have to go back to jail they're not
going to be driving that road so it's
not for their benefit
to me I don't really see the difference
between the Russian military and
prisoners
who are forced to work and I wonder if
the Russian military is starting to see
that themselves
meaning that you know once you get past
the officer level you know which is a
career when you get to the actual
fighting people
are they not saying to each other why
are we here
like why is it what's in it for us
right now of course they know that if
they try to you know desert they'll be
killed by their own team so they don't
want to do that so that's they're in
prison they can't leave and there's
nothing in it for them
what do you call that
okay they get it do they get a paycheck
maybe they do but uh they're still in
prison
all right
um
I talked to a
woman born in Russia
yesterday
and she still has you know Family in
Russia and so I asked her what's what's
the mood in Russia
if any of you done that
because mostly you probably know
somebody who knows somebody who lives in
Russia right have you gotten
um
so let me tell you what I heard
and then you tell me what you're
number one uh the older Russians are
more supportive of Putin
the reason given and this is just you
know by one person's observation
is that Putin has been priming Russia
for this move into Ukraine for so many
years
that the older ones just sort of got
used to this being you know Russia's
fate or something
so the old ones say Okay Putin made us
prosperous
and Putin raised Russia standing in the
International Community
true or false I mean until Ukraine
true or false let's say true
so the older ones are like okay we've
seen bad times and we've seen good times
and Putin brought us better times so
they're pretty supportive
the younger ones less so
so that was the first thing I needed to
know
the second thing is that even the older
ones
seem to now realize
that this is going to set Russia back 20
years
they might still support it but even in
supporting it they know that Russia just
got
pushed into the biz bag for a long time
right so
if everybody understands that Putin is
degrading Russia for the next 20 years
uh that's going to be bad for morale
really bad for morale all right uh
here's a this is very surprising you'll
be so surprised by this oh how a
surprise you will be hold on to your
chairs
because you might slide right out of
your chair in in total surprise at this
next story who would have ever seen this
coming the most unusual unexpected
surprising thing that could ever happen
in America
a former high-level FBA eye agent who is
involved
in the uh
russiagate
hoax
so he was a big investigator in that
he's being
investigated now for colluding with
Russia
yeah
that's right a former high-level FBI
agent who worked on the Russia collusion
hoax to frame basically to frame uh
Trump for colluding with Russia is being
indicted he's not guilty
he has not been found guilty so remember
innocent until proven guilty even the
FBI even if you mad at the FBI innocent
until proven guilty but indicted
for colluding
with Russia specifically some Russia
Russian billionaire don't know the
details
now are you surprised that a
high-ranking member of the FBI was
colluding with Russia while working on
the Russia collusion hoax
nope
nope
that is not surprising at all I'm sorry
if you think you're going to surprise me
with that you're going to have to work a
lot harder
that is right on the nose
do you know what Republicans always
expect now I'm not a republican but I
know what they expect
do you know what they always expect
that if Republicans are accused of
anything
what's that mean
what's it mean when a republican is
accused of a specific crime
it means the Democrats are doing it
then they're doing it right now
every time
boy the first time I heard that theory
that whatever they accuse you of I think
Tucker probably said it first whatever
they accuse you of is what they're doing
I said to myself wow
no I mean no that's just you know you
just notice it because there are a few
cases like that so A few prominent cases
don't make any kind of a pattern right
it's just use confirmation by us that
they're not literally accusing you of
the crimes they're doing right now
they're not literally doing that
but they are
they are they're literally accusing the
Republicans of the crimes they're doing
right now
and and the beauty of it is that from a
persuasion perspective it really works
well
probably the single best way you can
make yourself look innocent is to
preemptively accuse somebody else of the
crime you just committed
the the best way you could look innocent
of starting a fire
well no that's not true
because I think arsonists actually do
report the fire don't they that's a bad
example
they do report it right is that true
arsonist's report the first on the scene
but do they report it there's also the
people who volunteer to help look for
the the lost little girl
usually the guilty ones
anyway
um so that's happening
um
there's a poll on Christianity
which used to be 90 of the country I
think when I was a kid 90 of the country
identified as
Christian
and now it's in the 60s and if the trend
continues and these are not people who
are
not religious they're simply not
Christian
so many of them are non-denominational
so they might say I'm spiritual I
believe in God and Jesus but I don't
have a specific religion
although I would call that Christian
um
so it looks like Christianity is going
to be a a minority of the people in this
country if the trend continues what do
you think
you think the trend will continue or
reverse
I think it'll continue
because
um it's correlated with what
you're gonna hate this
what what is a decrease in religion
correlated with
yeah it's correlated with education
now I'm pro-religion
just in case you forgot I'm very
pro-religion
because it seems to work
my observation is that the people who
have a religion and practice it and you
know wrap their life strategy around it
do pretty darn good
pretty darn good and now you could argue
that it's the Liberal Liberal education
that's causing people to be less
religious probably
true
but there will be less of it
now here's why that worries me
independent of what religion got it
right we're not arguing that
Christianity works really well with free
markets doesn't it
have you noticed how well that works
Christianity plus free markets is your
best combination
it's not an accident that the United
States did well and so we combined the
two most powerful forces
Christianity Plus
free markets because if you have free
markets without the Christianity what do
you get
what do you get
free market with no Christianity
massive corruption
how do you do a deal
so the reason that I might do a deal
with you is that I know that you're
worried that God is watching
it really helps
I would definitely do a deal with a
somebody who wore the religion on their
sleeve you know so you could really see
that their religion I would definitely
do a deal with a religious person
Christian specifically
uh I'm not ruling out another religions
I'm just talking about Christianity I
would do a deal with a Christian
before I would do a deal with a
non-Christian
and I'm not a Christian
it's just an observation that they have
that little extra God Is Watching You
thing
that works to my advantage
so I would definitely discriminate
against non-christians in a business
deal
is that even legal
is it that's not legal is it I just
realize that's not legal
but I would definitely do it
you know I wouldn't do it overtly but I
could see that I would be biased by it
you know what I mean like I wouldn't go
out of my way to turn somebody down for
not being a Christian I wouldn't do that
but I'm sure I would be biased
by a Christian business person because
they'd have just that little extra
somebody's watching me
thing that works for my advantage
yeah all right
um
so scientists are using AI to come up
with new proteins
I guess the old way of dreaming up a new
protein
was a massive trial and error for years
and then if you're lucky you've got some
combination that would be a new protein
whereas the AI can just say ah how about
these 100 new proteins I just came up
with right now
and they could be awesome
now I don't know
how big a change that is
because I'm not I'm not scientifically
literate enough to know how big a deal
it is if you can design your own
proteins but it feels like it's pretty
big
doesn't it is there a is there a
scientist here
it feels really big
feels really big
so here are some of the things that AI
will change forever That You Don't See
coming right number one energy
do you understand that one do you know
why the energy Market will be completely
transformed by AI
because AI can design
well it can operate a new design
for a nuclear power plant that will be
continuously adjusting to optimize the
reaction
and reduce the chance of any problems
it's something we couldn't do before you
need AI to really rapidly make changes
to keep everything stable
so it probably will be one of the key
Technologies for solving climate change
it will invent things
in in 15 years
there's always always people who believe
that AI is the next flying car meaning
it's never going to get here but flying
cars are going to get here
by the way
you know that flying cars are guaranteed
in the future right
we're always waiting for them but they
are guaranteed because batteries will
just keep getting better and that's all
you needed you just needed an electric
flying car because AI
can also keep your flying car stable
right you can keep your flying car
stable with AI and then all you needed
was a battery that was light enough and
powerful enough and you're done all the
other stuff is just engineering like
basic engineering the two hard parts are
the AI to keep keep everything stable
you know when there's lots of moving
parts
and the battery salt they're both solved
um
so that's a big deal so so we'll be
making people we'll be designing more
efficient networks we'll probably find
better ways to keep the lights on
maximize the grid
I mean it just the number of things that
AI could potentially do is just insane
all right
that may be
just about everything I want to talk
about
um
just being Christian
so this uh this business of
uh making Democrats
um face their own policies
is really good it's really good
persuasion and but I think the
Republicans
here's my my basic take
Democrats have opened up this five-lane
highway of opportunity for any
Republican
what would it take
for a republican to stay on the highway
just don't make gigantic obvious
mistakes that's it
just don't make gigantic obvious
mistakes
and what are they doing
what are the Republicans doing instead
they're making gigantic obvious mistakes
yeah they're you know hammering on
um
hammering on abortion to make that a key
thing that people are thinking about
they can't possibly work for Republicans
you know I don't care what principle he
was he was operating under if we're
talking strategy
I just don't think that was a strategy
um
now
doesn't it seem to you
that when the whole country appears to
be falling apart
and when things were working well under
a republican it should be the easiest
thing in the world
but I feel like
Republicans can't stop themselves from
making crazy arguments
does anybody feel that because a lot of
you are lean right if you're watching
this probably but do you feel that that
Republicans shoot themselves in the foot
but they'll make their strong Republican
argument for free markets and you know
getting rid of regulations and stuff
stuff that sounds pretty pretty solid
and then they'll just throw in something
that's bad crazy
yeah self-sabotage it looks like it just
like Trump yeah the the only thing that
could keep Trump from regaining the
presidency is Trump
but Trump is completely lacking a
positive message as are the Republicans
in general what is the positive message
of the Republicans
will take you back to 2020.
that's the message right for 2019. yeah
we'll take you back to 2019.
aren't you all fired up about that
uh we're going back to 2019. I can't
wait
that is the least inspirational message
you could ever have
let me tell you an inspirational message
from a Republican
we're going to solve climate change
and I don't even care if it's real
because we need the energy and we need
it to be clean and I'm going to make
nuclear my focus I'm going to get rid of
the regulations that are blocking the
new bills
just Embrace their topic just say look
you guys you made you made your sale
we're going to go serious with green
energy but we're not going to do it the
stupid way
we're going to do it the smart way
because even Elon Musk says you're not
going to get away with getting rid of
nuclear
so I'm going to agree with the smartest
guy in the world musk about energy
probably
we're going to do we're going to go
crazy on the thing that's green energy
the best one
and we're going to solve your climate
change for you
even if you don't believe it's real
because I'm going to give you so much
cheap energy that's clean that if
climate change isn't a problem you'll
forget you're ever worried about it
you're just going to be glad you had
your cheap energy
I will make you forget that climate
change was a problem
because whether your problem is you
don't have enough energy
or your problem is that you're you know
putting too much CO2 in the air I'll
solve both of those problems and I don't
even care if one of them wasn't real
you can argue all day whether whether
climate change is going to destroy us in
80 years I'm going to make sure it's not
an option
I don't know if climate change is real
I'm no scientist I'm going to make sure
there's no risk though
because they're smart people who say it
is a risk so I'm going to make sure
there is no risk and I'm going to do it
for free
and what I mean by free is I'm going to
do what you wanted me to do anyway which
is give you lots of reliable clean
energy
it's also going to solve your climate
change problem and a few Democrats think
that the climate change was a hoax keep
thinking it it doesn't matter the
problem is going to go away either way
I'm going to solve your problem even if
it isn't real I'll solve real problems
I'll solve my imaginary problems you
send me a problem and I'm going to work
on solving it and I'm going to let you
work on whether I'm an
well how about you guys think about that
go back to your rooms if you don't want
to be part of the useful Solutions if
you don't want a system that works if
you don't want a world that works why
don't you go back to your rooms and then
think about what how big of an I
am because that's all you're
good for if you're not going to help go
back and complain to each other about
how we're all Nazi
while we're trying to save your
children's lives
all right I'll be working on that you
work on what a bad character I have and
that thing I tweeted once all right you
go work on that prove to the country
that you have no value
while I'm working on saving the country
right
now you tell me
the Republicans can't win everything
how hard would it be
they would just have to not be stupid
somebody on locals is saying that what I
just said was brilliant it's not that my
whole point is that it's easy it's not
brilliant
you just have to do what Clinton did
brilliantly which is except the other
person's argument and then top it
rejecting the other person's argument
just keeps them over there fighting with
you you have to embrace their argument
and then top it that's what I did with
climate change I embraced it and that I
gave you a better solution than they
were giving you for the for the problem
that you don't even think is a problem
in some cases
by the way I think climate change is
real
and I think it doesn't matter
because everything you need to do you
need to do anyway
we need some clean reliable energy
there's only one way to get it
two ways if you say solar is part of the
answer I think it is I think it is
how about this
uh how about your president you say you
know what the only way to solve the uh
solve the network problem is more people
have to have a solar battery at their
house
now I think musk would agree
because I think there's a way
if enough homes have their own solar
backup power they could feed the grid
when the green grid needs it
I believe there's a way to protect the
grid without completely redoing it we
also need to completely redo it
but in the short run if you said hey
let's get everybody who can afford it
these solar batteries
if you're rich enough to get a solar
battery do the country a favor and get
one
how about that message
I'm not asking poor people to do
anything differently
we're just trying to keep the lights on
for you guys but if you can afford it
the the house battery will pay for
itself so I'm not asking you to lose
money I'm asking you to do what makes
sense for yourself
in a free market but know that this
specific thing that you're doing for
yourself getting a house battery
whether it's Tesla or some other product
there's a bunch of them now that that
thing will be good for you but it's
going to be really good for the poor
people
because we're keeping everybody's lights
on and keeping the prices down
yeah like a Tesla power wall but they're
they're competitors to that now
all right so how easy is it to make
these arguments
now abortion
uh here's what the Republicans have done
wrong with abortion you ready
now and I remind you
that you will not hear my opinion of
whether abortion should be legal or not
because I leave that to women
you can argue with me all day I just
want to make the point that I'm not
arguing what should or should not be
leave it to women
and here's what Republicans have done
totally wrong
they've allowed the Democrats to paint
it as a male versus female issue
unbelievable
unbelie the incompetence from the
Republicans to allow that to happen
unbelievable
there should never be a republican male
who talks about abortion again
you want to be smart
you want to be smart the first the first
time Trump says you know what
how about men just stop talking about it
there are plenty of Republican women
let's find some Republican women who
want to take the argument and just get
the out of the argument
get the men out
you don't think Trump could win the
entire election by just saying you know
I think it's a little distasteful to
have men talking about abortion
we have strong feelings
but let's let the women take the lead on
this I think we'll get a better outcome
seriously how hard was that
if I already made myself president
how hard was that
the Republicans completely could turn
the conversation around
by now now let me ask you this
before you heard the Pence rule about
Pence would say you wouldn't go to lunch
or a dinner with a woman unless his wife
was Sarah as well
um when you first heard that you thought
oh
that's that's extreme
maybe some of you thought it was
brilliant from the start but the more
you think about it like it just becomes
a better and better justice system for
keeping everybody happy right
um and you probably thought that you
couldn't make that happen
but I'll bet you Republicans all over
the world when they heard that Pence was
doing that I'll bet you because I did
I'm not a republican but even I said you
know
I'm going to adopt that standard which I
have
yeah except when I'm single I would
never have a meal with just a another
woman
if that was the only person there
so I I adopted Pence's standard as soon
as I heard it because I thought you know
that does make sense
so now imagine
now imagine Trump repent sir whoever's
running for president as a republican
imagine them coming out and saying
let's let's let the women take the lead
on this
we have very strong opinions
but for political purposes and really
for the benefit of the country let's
just let the women take the lead
you get the same result right because
the Republican women are on the same
side as the Republican men mostly
all right now give me another issue let
me do another one what's another issue
in which
Republicans are weak
what's their weakest issue
the Border you think Republicans are
weak On the Border no Republicans have
the advantage of the border so
Republicans have the advantage in
education
Advantage Health Care they do not
Health Care is a problem
what would you do with health care I'll
tell you what I'd do
I'd say I want health care for everyone
and we need a plan for it
because I would embrace the other side's
argument and then I would top it
I'd say we can get there and to be a
great country we should have a plan to
do it but it shouldn't be forced it
shouldn't be communism it shouldn't be
socialism we should have a plan and that
plan should be to use
technology and Ai and maybe Telehealth
and free markets and less regulations
and basically you make an argument that
you need to get to 100 coverage
you need to
and just say we can do it better
we'll get there through free market
that's how you do things the Democrats
also want to cover everybody but they
just want to take the money out of your
pocket to do it
it would be easy to win all of these
arguments and the and the technique
should always be the same instead of
rejecting the other person's argument
you embrace it
and then you top it you're absolutely
right but your solution for it is wrong
here's the solution
yeah GOP should say we're the we are the
um the party of solutions we want better
systems for Education better systems for
Health Care better systems for whatever
and just say the Democrats are the ones
who just want to insult us while we're
working
and if the Republicans could frame the
situation as Republicans have nothing
but insults
and they'll just keep saying that
while saying we here's our plans for how
to make things better and Republicans
basically just have insults
every time the Democrats would insult
then the Republicans would no longer
need to address it
they could dismiss it say well this is
why we're running
so here's a typical question that the
news would say
um the news says that uh you know
they're calling you uh Hitler
so instead of saying I'm not Hitler
you're Hitler that's what don't
Republicans usually say that I'm not
Hitler you're Hitler how's that work out
it doesn't
how about this
well you know here's our we're working
on this plan to fix this problem and the
Democrats are mostly working on a plan
of how to more cleverly insult us
and if you think that working on a plan
to more cleverly insult the citizens is
where you want to put your energy you
have that option but I hope
you'd work with us to improve our plan
which admittedly will never be perfect
you know we'll have to work on it do a
little a b testing a little tweaking and
if you don't like it on day one work
with us we'll try to improve it but you
have to work within the rules of what
makes sense free markets
you know less regulation
do you know why ESG
is a looks like a nightmare to
Republicans
but looks like the best thing in the
world for Democrats
is this
Republicans look at the system and they
say wait a minute we have a system where
there would be a company
competing you know for its shareholders
and it would do whatever it could as an
independent company you know within the
law to to maximize and then that worked
we had the most dynamic economy
so that's a republican system
and then the Democrats are people who
only exist to insult other people
and they say we're going to insult you
in three different ways we're going to
call you a racist because you don't have
enough equity and inclusion
we're going to call you a science denier
because you're not doing enough about
the environment
basically we're going to come up with
some insults and then we're going to
destroy your system
by creating this confusing set of
entities that are you know judging you
and and trying to determine whether
you're worthy of investment and buying
their products
so basically all Republicans know that
if you add this extra burden of of three
different preferences like it's not even
one thing it's not even just about the
environment
it's about government governance plus
the environment plus you know social
responsibility so there there's all
these murky things if you put that on
top of free markets is that a better
system or a worse one
every Republican knows that's worse
now it's hard to explain why it's worse
to people who don't understand the
systems
have to be designed to you know work
with human characteristics Etc
so you're always going to have the
Democrats saying let's find a new way to
insult people I got it
will say that they don't have enough
diversity therefore they're racist
how else can we insult people I got it
they're not doing enough for climate
change so therefore they're science
deniers
right but basically the Democrats are
always looking for the angle to insult
you
and the Republicans if they framed it
correctly would always be looking for
the way to make a system that works for
everybody
and invite the Democrats in
invite the Democrats
so it would be so easy all right give me
another one give me another place the
Dem the Republicans are weak
on drugs
no on pot
yeah pot would be easy all right
here's me being a better Republican
about marijuana
the federal government should get out of
that
I'm dumb all Trump has to do is just say
the words
let the states do that federal
government should not be making
marijuana illegal
so easy
now now by the way am I proving to you
that the Republicans do have a five-line
highway and they can't seem to find the
highway
they're they're over on they're over on
the sidewalk over there talking about
abortion laws that won't be passed
it's like they're not even on the
highway
how do you not find the whole highway
it could not be easier to win if you're
a republican this time and they found a
way to lose
by basically being drawn into the
Democrats frame
right defending themselves and arguing
you did it to stuff like that
oh I do think the shipping of the uh
immigrants is horrible
now the the Republicans are arguing
that these people are being used as
Pawns
in every case
right unfortunately they're being used
as puns in every case secondly if
they're illegal
I have no moral qualms with using them
for
political purposes if the political
purposes are well intentioned in this
case I think they are
you know to have a secure border
so I don't mind that illegal aliens
are being used as props
to make a political point I don't have
any problem with that at all because it
doesn't seem especially cruel to the
people involved
do you think that the people who ended
up at Martha's Vineyard are going to
have a worse time
making it than the people who went into
you know the the mess of all the other
migrants and everybody's trying to find
the few opportunities and stuff
I don't know I I suspect that they'll
all have food in a warm place to sleep
you know you know it would be hilarious
if by if uh Obama actually did open up
his mansion
and let them stay there
that would be such a baller thing to do
because it was it was sort of just like
change the argument you'd be like okay
didn't see that coming
did not see that coming
he could do it
because he has multiple houses right he
could just say yeah until the problem is
worked out
put those migrants at my
Martha's Vineyard House he could it's
not going to happen right it won't
happen
all right
um give me another one what's another
what's another Republican weakness
guns
I don't know that guns
are going to be an issue
I'm trying to remember I don't think
it's in the top five is it
I don't think guns are in the top five
and I believe that Democrats are buying
them as quickly as Republicans are
if you tell me Democrats aren't buying
guns at a pretty high rate right now
I don't believe that
I I feel like guns could be ignored
because the Republicans already have the
better argument
although I think that the here's what
the
here's what the uh Republicans do wrong
on guns
they let they let Biden Define it as it
would be citizens against the military
of the United States
that will never happen
no nobody's talking about the citizens
with their little uh little little guns
taking on the military
but they let they let Biden Define that
as the problem
do you know what would be more like did
I tell you that uh five russian-backed
officials have were murdered just
yesterday in russian-dominated
territories in Ukraine
that's what happens
what happens is every time the
let's say illegitimate government
who is trying to take your guns or
whatever they were trying to do that as
soon as they install a puppet there's
not enough Security in the world
to protect that puppet like you craved
so in Ukraine every Russian puppet will
probably be murdered probably everyone
eventually
you know it just takes a while but it
looks like they're just going to kill
every one of them because they can there
would be nothing that could stop them
from getting every one of them because
you're not going to let every official
have an underground bunker
right so and you don't have to get the
top people like you don't have to use
your your handgun to get to the
president of the United States who's
become a dictator and taken over the
country you only have to get to the
like the mayor
like the people were just sort of
keeping the lights on just get to them
Kill Them All
which is exactly what would happen
if the U.S tried to turn into some kind
of a dictatorship and install you know
like puppets everywhere we would just
kill all the puppets because it would be
easy everybody has a gun
so there's no way
that there's no way our government
couldn't could let's say take over and
then actually control the public because
to control the public you had to at
least control let's say the chief of
police
right
you'd have to at least get the chief of
police
do you think every chief of police is
going to be able to protect their own
home
no everybody knows where the chief of
police lives
where their family lives
You couldn't possibly be a chief of
police and turn against the public in
the United States
maybe you could do it somewhere else but
you can't do it here
because all we need to know is where you
live
they're not going to send and then let's
say they send the military
let's say they can get enough military
to show up in your little town I mean I
don't know how that would be possible it
wouldn't be enough of them
but all you'd have to do is see the face
of any of the military people right
would they all have to wear masks
they better
because if you see the face of a soldier
who is turned onto you in the United
States you're going to take his picture
and then his family's in trouble
because they're going to find the family
so there isn't any way that you can turn
against the public on a retail basis
it's not going to be a war between our
guns and their nukes but somehow the
Republicans have allowed Biden to Define
it that way
because it's hard to explain what I just
explained right
but here's the way I'd explain it the
next time Biden says you know you're not
going to be able to fight against our
tanks and our nukes I would say this
we're not going to be fighting against
them
we're going to make sure that the chief
of police in our town doesn't go to your
side
right
you only need the chief of police
because they if you get the chief of
police
what are they going to do
they're going to send the military into
every town in the United States
couldn't do it you couldn't do it you
only have to threaten the life of the uh
the police chief
which you could very effectively do if
all of your citizens had guns
do you know who else would
threaten the life of the police chief
the cops
why why would all the cops just suddenly
join the dictator that's not going to
happen
they're Patriots right
so you could install as many puppets as
you want but we'll kill them as fast as
you install them
I mean even I would kill a puppet
if they put a like a puppet mayor in my
little town to Pleasanton I'd kill him
I mean if nobody else would
I'll take that job
so
I there's just no way you could take
over the United States
too many guns
you got really quiet when I when I
started saying this but by the way does
everybody buy the argument
that the guns only need to be useful on
the local level
because that's all you need to control
your town
right
so so somehow the
um
the argument should be the reason that
Russia won't be able to control Ukraine
in the long run
is because there will be enough guns
there to kill all of their puppets
so here's the quick version
we're not going after your nukes
we're going to kill all of your puppets
you don't think we can get to your
puppets yeah we don't have to get to
your senators or your secret military
army we don't have to get to that we
don't have to get to your inner circle
we're just going to make sure that if
you put somebody in our town we'll just
 kill them
um
all right what else
I think the argument for education is
just so strongly Republican now
race
all right let's talk about race what
could the Republicans do
own race easy
as one
you ready
first you embrace the other side's
argument
systemic racism my God it's bad
yeah that's bad
the systemic racism is really something
we need to work on so let's get rid of
the school
um the teachers you needs
because that's the only way you're going
to fix things and you make you make the
teachers unions the source of all the
primary source of continuing inequality
and you say look Democrats join with us
we'll work on the biggest problem first
if we can solve the biggest problem then
maybe we'll have some momentum to work
together on the second biggest problem
but we could definitely work together on
the biggest problem
and the biggest problem is instead of
Republicans ignoring that there is a
systemic and built-in disadvantage to
the black population
could you just say it
would it kill you to be a Republican and
say yes it does look like there's some
lasting disadvantage that's you know
reaching into the black community
would it kill you to say it even if you
don't believe it
because I know the counter argument
would be other groups have troubles
there are other poor people you know
some poor people make it out therefore
everybody can make it out you know what
about the the Asian population and the
Jewish population why are they doing
well you know so you could argue in a
way right but it's the wrong approach
that's not how you win you don't win by
telling the other side they're wrong
you win by embracing their argument
and topping it
embrace it
and top it you can't be beaten if you do
that that's an unbeatable strategy
embrace it and top it denying the
problem loses every time
I think that loses every time
you can only get your own team to deny
the problem
you need to accept it reframe it and top
it
lgbtq you talk about the trans Sports
things specifically I don't think
anybody cares
about lgbtq
in terms of the election and the voting
nobody's going to vote on that are they
might vote on the the young people and
the education in the school part
but beyond that there's no real issue is
there with the lgbtq community I just
don't think people care about enough
except for the children issue yeah
so they care about that
all right uh the FBI I don't know does
anybody trust the FBI anymore do you
think do you think Democrats really
trust them
I don't think so
all right so have I made my point
that if a republican followed my advice
of embracing the other argument and
topping it
that it's a five it's a five-lane
highway of just easiness
you could just scroll down the middle of
the five Lane Highway with no traffic
going to the White House
and but but what will whoever the
Republican president is what will they
do instead of what I just said
probably tell a bunch of Lies
right it doesn't matter who it is you
could say it's Trump or somebody else
it'll probably be just a bunch of Lies
and it's the worst technique
because then they get fact checked and
then the other team says you're a bunch
of liars and they have lots of material
to say you're a liar and then they're
happy because they have something to
criticize a person about
as soon as you lie you make it about you
right
am I right
if you talk about your policies
that they've they're sort of forced to
talk about the policy but as soon as you
stick a lie in there with your policy
the LIE is the only thing anybody's
going to talk about and then the lies
about you and you just took the focus
off of your excellent plan and put it on
your bad character
oh
um I want to solve the fentanyl crisis
right now if I could
I did this yesterday in the man cave
talking just to the local subscribers by
the way local subscribers who saw my
idea for the fentanyl persuasion was
that persuasive
those of you who saw it because I won't
repeat it unless you liked it
did that
okay I get a yes is there all right
here's the problem with fentanyl
persuasion so far
here's me doing a bad job of persuading
you that you need to do something about
fentanyl okay
um blah blah blah statistics
blah blah blah big alarming number blah
blah blah worse than some Wars
blah blah blah coming from Mexico blah
blah blah comes from China
now that gets you right off the couch
doesn't it statistics
or how about I show you a graph
here's my graph look at that line that
line was going like this but now it's
going like this it's a line beware of my
line on my graph run away there's a line
on a graph
nothing
here's how you deal with the problem
you get your AI which can now make
artistic renderings of anything
and you program an AI to create a new uh
visual piece of art every day and you
tell it to make a photo realistic you're
not a
not an artistic version but like a photo
realistic like it was a photograph
picture of a pile of a 300 dead
Americans
like a different pile of corpses
and you do a different pile every day
you just tweet it and you say you hear
the people killed by fentanyl today
300.
because if you hear onesies and twosies
and you know my stepson died and you
know your brother's cousin died
it's horrible on a small level but it
doesn't make you act
do you know why the Holocaust is such a
persuasive part of our our being
it's because of the visuals
it's the visuals do you know what the
other so-called Holocaust don't have
going for them
pictures
pictures
right you know we always hear about the
like Armenian wasn't there some Armenian
Holocaust right I've never seen a
picture
I've heard statistics and they're
alarming right
but if you don't have the pictures
you're not scaring people
so let's use AI
to create a literally a pile of corpses
every day tweeted out or retweeted or
retweet it every day
and
we will make it a big enough problem so
that the United States decides it's a
you know something to do about it and by
the way if I were a republican I would
say I would attack the cartels in Mexico
and I would make the I would make the
Democrats argue that that's a bad idea
because I don't think they can
the trouble is it would lure them into
your frame
they don't want to be there
and and I don't you know this could
backfire because it's pretty radical
um
they call her racist
yeah they call everything and if they
call it racist then what do you do you
say well here's another example where
Republicans are trying to fix the system
and the Democrats are busy trying to
figure out what would be the most clever
insult for the people who are trying to
fix things
now let me let me just check with you
because when I'm talking I'm I'm not
reading the comments at the same time so
well
have I proven my point
the Republicans have a real easy
argument for everything
for everything
before you prove it
I see it now
I'd like to know what the no person
thinks
all right
and are you are you angered at how easy
it is
does it piss you off a little bit
because it is the CC
I'm pretty sure it is this easy
but we don't have anybody executing at
that level
and I don't think I'm qualified I
wouldn't be qualified to run for office
but
I I know it looks like it looks easy to
me
all right
um
yeah you know uh was it
I think it was a sort of edge tweet I
haven't mentioned him the entire
livestream so I think I need to
um
sternovich had a tweet about
it's very real that people are afraid of
succeeding I think that's the way you
put it something like that the people
who seem to choose paths that would
guarantee failure
and they seem to be doing it
intentionally
have you noticed that
is that your impression that some people
will choose a path that's just clearly
self-destructive
yeah I think that's real I don't know
what's behind it exactly
afraid of success yeah
all right so
my beloved audience
um I'm going to take my leave I think
this was one of the all-time all-time
best live streams
not only if I change politics in America
by showing the better way to do it
but I believe I've made great strides in
solving all of our largest Problems by
showing that if they're treated as
systems problems and you can swipe away
the dingleberries that are doing nothing
but insulting you cleverly
America
could be awesome
and so on that note goodbye to you on
YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow you're
all awesome
