hey everybody
come on in it's time again for the best
time of the day let me check yeah
still the best part of the day i just
checked all right
[Music]
and if you want to enjoy this
pre-thanksgiving show
more than usual all you need is a copper
mug or glass attacker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that will make you
really love your thanksgiving it's
called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now
yeah that's good just as good as i'd
hoped
well there's lots of stuff to talk about
do you want to talk about all the
stuff okay
i might have to change the simultaneous
uh sip during the biden administration
i might change it to the uh
simultaneous sleep or
something different all right uh here's
an interesting report
apparently uh jordan peterson's new book
is being handled by my publisher so
uh penguin random house is the
larger entity that includes my publisher
but the canadian version of them which
is different from my publisher
they're crying and shaking and they're
very upset
that the publisher might want to publish
a jordan peterson book
can you imagine that employees are so
distraught his opinions that they would
they would have a problem with it now
shout out to my publisher here i am
a notable trump supporting person
have they ever given me any problem at
my publisher
for being an obvious trump-supporting
person
no not once and i would bet
that there isn't i don't know for sure
but i
bet there is not a single employee that
i've dealt with
within my publisher who is even close to
agreeing with me
on my opinions politically probably not
even close
and not once not once
have i gotten even a whiff that that
would be a problem
indeed they've published two books
including one that was very pro-trump
so whatever this uh this uh
problem is in canada um i can tell you
it doesn't seem to have infected my
new york-based uh publisher that's
part of that larger corporate entity so
that's just a
compliment to them
here's a question so we're talking about
closing restaurants
with these new spikes and corona cases
and la's going to close restaurants
etc and i'd ask what's the data
is there any data to support closing
restaurants
and turns out there's not but
officials were asked and i guess they
referred to some cdc data that said that
people who went to restaurants had more
infections
now do you see the problem with that
suppose the one thing you knew
is that there was definitely a
difference and the people who went to
restaurants
had more infections would that tell you
anything
because it wouldn't tell you if the
restaurant gave it to him
because somebody who is likely to go to
a restaurant
in public during a pandemic
don't you think it's also very likely
that they did a number of other things
that would be higher risk than somebody
who would never go to a restaurant
during a pandemic so how could you
possibly isolate that the restaurant was
the cause
when all you've done is identify people
who are less afraid of the virus
now i would think that the questions
that should be asked
when you take the test to the extent
that you can connect the person in the
test later
given that you have to wait for results
wouldn't it be good if you had a little
a little form to fill out that was just
check these boxes
and before you get your test you you
check have you eaten in a restaurant
in the past week have you gone to an
outdoor
protest in the past week you know have
you gone to a
trump rally in the past week and just
have
whatever are your say top 10 questions
that you'd like to get a sense of
whether there's some correlation
now could you sus out
whether the person is a general
non-mask wearer versus the problem was
just a restaurant
probably i'm no expert on this field
but i think if you ask the right
questions you could find out if they
generally don't comply
or if it was just a specific problem i
think
somebody will have to clear me up on
that but i don't think we do that
and this is different from contact
tracing
which i imagine would be more than we
could do but
uh just finding out if they've had
certain kinds of behaviors would be good
to know
alyssa milano as you know has extended
an olive
branch she says quote i'd like to extend
an olive branch
to trump supporters i'm ready to to move
forward together
here's the thing if the only
problem that uh the two sides had had
is that they disagreed vigorously over
politics
i'd say good thought let's see if we
could work together
if the only problems we had were let's
say generic
insults such as you're uninformed
you're stupid you're selfish
you don't understand i could get past
that
pretty easily right somebody calls you
dumb or uninformed
that's just you know tuesday on twitter
that doesn't really mean much
but that's not exactly what happened
here
my experience was that i was called a
racist
and marked for violence
 you if you think i'm getting over
that
 you i'm not getting over that
that's a that's a don't get over it ever
like go to my grave
i'm not getting over that i'll
get over a lot
there's a lot of stuff i could get over
i'm not really the kind who holds a
grudge
i'm not the kind who was bothered for a
long time about
somebody's opinion you know i don't i
don't lose sleep because somebody
insulted me on twitter you know or they
misinterpreted something
i said i don't care too much about that
right you know i i can respond on
twitter or stuff but
but by the next day i don't care
right it doesn't last all day but
when you tag somebody as racist
in in public consistently and
and quite vigorously and
it starts to stick you
 you hard because
no i'm not getting over that not even a
little bit not even a chance
not one percent not even a little
 bit
that's that was too far and now you just
have to live with that
that i hate your guts just live
with it
because i'll be living with what you
gave me
i'll just ask you the same just live
with the fact that i think you're a
 piece of by the way not
alyssa milano
i think she's actually a good person
i'm talking about the idea all right so
as far as alyssa mulana goes you've
heard me defend her before
because while i disagree with her on
many things i think she's actually
well intentioned so this is not about
her
this is about the idea of of getting
past it
i'm not going to get past it not even a
little bit but i do like alyssa milano
and i don't have any specific problem
with her
i think that um she is unique among
celebrities
because she puts in work so when i see
an
ice cube or or an alyssa milano
or even um even kaepernick
i've even defended him much to your
dismay
when people put in the work i have a
different opinion
which is all right you're studying it
you're putting in the work you're
putting your reputation on the line
you're risking your career that's
sincere
that's very sincere so i have complete
appreciation for those few celebrities
who
take it to the next level it's just the
drive-bys that i don't like
you know the the the rob reiner types
i i think they're just sort of drive-by
trolls i don't respect them
in my opinion and i said this when trump
first got elected
i think disruptors should be
one one term presidents
i feel like you know there could be
exceptions of course
but i feel like as a good general rule
when somebody is sort of a standard
president you know let's say a
bill clinton two terms
makes sense i would say obama was fairly
standard two terms if
if that's what the public wants i'm okay
with that
but the disruptors they're sort of
coming in to do a turnaround
i don't think you want the turnaround
specialist
to be your steady state person it's a
different skill set
and i'm quite appreciative of the
box shaking that trump has done and
those of you who recall
in his first term i said you know what
would be perfect
a one-term president you heard me say
that a lot right
when when he first got elected and it
had nothing to do with what qualities
i thought he had or how good a job he
would do
or any of that it's just that a
disrupter
maybe should be a one-term president you
know if that's what you're selling
and and then you deliver it you actually
deliver that disruption
boy did he deliver it i feel like
one term might might have been the right
solution
and i don't want to scare you because i
know you're not going to like this
but should he decide that he wants to
run for a second term
at what would be age 78
i'm on record saying that's too too old
i said it about biden
now i think there is a difference in you
know their their mental acuity
so one person isn't just like another
but 78 is too old
it's just too old and i don't know that
i will change that opinion
um let's see
so biden said he would not pick uh
probably would not pick
elizabeth warren or bernie sanders for
cabinet positions
because he doesn't want to lose strong
senators because he needs to get things
through congress as well
he isn't that convenient
isn't it convenient that joe biden has
this other reason
not to put warren or sanders in the
cabinet
because i think the first reason is he
doesn't want them in the cabinet
that's probably reason number one but
reason number two is pretty good
it's such a good excuse that i looked at
this and i thought oh that's pretty
good and i and and i know you're not
going to like this
if you're you're still sort of stuck in
the
in the fight if you will if you're if
your mind is still in the fight
you're not going to like it but i will
occasionally complement
the things that biden does just be ready
for it
right because i'm not gonna be the guy
who just says everything he does is
stupid and bad and
dementia right i'm gonna say if he does
something
right and this was kind of clever i
would say that this is something he did
right
because it would be a big mistake to put
warner sanders in the cabinet
he knows that so credit him for knowing
that
but this claim that they're stronger as
senators
is both true and it gets them off the uh
it gets them off the problem pretty
clever
so uh if you're looking for little
signals
that biden will be competent or not
competent i would say this is pretty
good signal
of competence we'll see if that lasts
i tweeted a uh youtube video of
somebody named ms artisa bomer
who is a witness to ballot fraud in
detroit
she says and i'm listening to the video
where she's describing her experience as
one of the
the election watchers or observers or
whatever there
and it sounded really convincing
and i thought to myself there's too much
detail here
uh oh somebody says they're waiting for
the kraken
we'll get to the kraken i'm glad you're
waiting
so i'm listening to her story and i'm
finding it very
credible and if it is credible it only
tells you what happened in that one room
but it would indicate if it were true
might be kind of a big problem generally
you'd have to look to find it but it
would certainly make both of your
eyebrows go
if it were true so i'm listening to her
story and thinking god this is really
convincing
um there are really some problems there
and then she goes to the part about the
quote override button
and she describes how ballots would be
fed into the counting machine and then
according to her i think every time or a
lot of times i forget but
some substantial number of times she
would observe with her own eyes
the operator pushing the override button
which he described as having the feature
of being able to
to move votes from uh
from trump to biden
do you believe there's an override
button
on the counting machine that moves votes
just from one candidate to the other in
a three-party race
it's a three-party race
or more i suppose
that's where she lost to me
now somebody sent me a copy of the
directions for the machine and sure
enough
there does exist an override button
there's actually an override button but
if you read it
in the description it doesn't do what
she said she observed it doing now
could it be that there's something to
the story and maybe that part was a
little misinterpreted
maybe i suppose i suppose you could use
that override button
in some mischievous way but not the way
she described it
you don't push the override button and
it takes the votes and moves them over
to the other side
that's not happening and if there's a
more complicated approach where you hit
the override button and then you've got
to make some adjustments
there wasn't time for that so
i gotta say that wasn't the most
credible
presentation i can't say it's not true
but i can say it did not pass my sniff
test so if you're
trying to determine what is true and
what is not true
i don't think that was the kraken all
right
there might be a kraken we'll get to
that but i don't think that was it
necessarily
but it's also possible and i can't rule
this out
it's possible that she legitimately
witnessed a whole bunch of fraud
and then when she saw that override
button thing maybe she thought it was
something that it wasn't maybe so
uh i just say uh be a little cautious on
that one
and i'll circle back to some more
election stuff let me let me ask you
this question it's a real good
question to test your world view which
you should do because don't you think
sometimes you could be wrong
do you ever consider that do you ever
just sit there and say
what if i'm wrong if you don't you kind
of should
it's a good it's a good practice just
ask yourself what would it look like if
you were wrong
and one of the ways that i get at that
is i say
what else would you need to believe for
your world
view to remain intact are there things
that you just
would have to also believe and maybe
those would be impossible to believe so
it's a good practice for example
if you believe that the election was
uh stolen would you have to believe
that there were massive people
in on it and somehow it wasn't detected
because i heard that argument it's like
how could there be all this
fraud and you wouldn't have witnesses
right so you would have to believe if
your world view
is that there was lots of fraud at least
in
some cities i mean it could be limited
to some cities
but there's still a lot of witnesses
right so how can you have
like let's say six cities
with massive fraud let's just say it's
just six cities because that's
the allegation could you do that
with all those witnesses and not have
lots of reports of mischief
is that possible how is that possible
to which i say i haven't read the 220
sworn statements of fraud
but if you have 220 people who said they
saw it
why are you arguing that nobody saw it i
mean i haven't seen them
so i can't tell you that they have
substance or they don't have substance
or if they're
technical complaints versus really
seeing some crime
i don't know i haven't seen them but if
you have 220
witnesses isn't that about what you'd
expect
if there were massive fraud so don't
those two numbers going to match up
now we don't know if those affidavits
really match
the allegations and whether they're real
or not real
but what we're observing is consistent
if you believe there was massive fraud
and if you believe there are all these
sworn statements that people saw stuff
that's consistent now if it turned out
that all of those
uh uh sworn affidavits were not about
seeing fraud maybe there were some
technical things or
or they were just wrong and they're
let's say they were all
dismissed and then you would have you'd
come back to
how could there be all this fraud and
you don't have even
one whistleblower if that happens
i think you have to re you would have to
review your opinion
now could you limit the number of people
involved in the fraud
to such a small number that that goes
away
in other words that you you just don't
have many witnesses
for example could you have somebody
simply unlock the back door so that a
van can pull up
and load a bunch of fake ballots into
the the warehouse
before they get counted i don't even
know if there's such a thing as a place
they keep them in a warehouse
but i'm just walking you through the
thought you'd have one person unlocking
the door
per per accounting area multiple
accounting areas
and one or two people in the van who
might be working
together would you expect one of them to
be a whistleblower
probably not right if you're the if
you're the door unlocker
or you're the van driver you don't want
to go to jail
and you don't want to get in trouble you
don't want your friends to kill you if
you
nark them out so you could probably get
it down to a few
criminal types who don't talk
might be possible suppose suppose there
was a hack
on the software for which i
tell you there is no proof all right
there's no proof of any hack
but suppose there had been how many
witnesses would there be
if one person hacked the system
none except the person who did the crime
who isn't going to be talking
so it is completely possible
i think to rig an election in a variety
of different ways
that would not necessarily have hundreds
of witnesses
but we might actually have hundreds of
witnesses so that's more of a wait and
see
but generally ask yourself what would be
true all right here's another one
uh we know that the dude the news is
fake
all right so just to see if you agree
with me as i go along
do you agree that the news is fake
i think the answer is yes right do you
agree this social media is biased
there's a report today from dr epstein
who said that they did a massive study
of
social media during the election process
and found that i forget the details but
something like a few weeks before the
election
the only people who were getting
election reminders from google
were democrats and apparently he can
prove this
he claims he so he had lots of
confederates
who he was monitoring so he could watch
their traffic
you know in their interactions with
social media and some of them must have
been democrats and some of them must
have been republicans
and then his software i believe this is
how it worked would just simply
collect their experiences and compare
them
so if you were if you were a republican
and you did not get a google reminder
about the election
would you notice you wouldn't notice you
wouldn't notice
something that didn't happen now if you
were
a democrat and you were using google and
you got a reminder to vote
would you think to tell people about it
would you say hey i was using using the
computer
and google gave me a reminder to vote
who would you tell nobody you wouldn't
tell anybody because it wouldn't mean
anything you would think i guess
google's telling people to vote that
seems like a good idea
you wouldn't know that the republicans
didn't get the reminder
you would have no way to know but dr
says that he created a system that would
catch that
and did now that's just one example
he claims that as soon as they uh they
surfaced that claim
that google reversed it and started
sending them to the reminders to both
i don't know if that part's true but
that's the claim so
but with or without that claim i don't
believe there's anybody watching this
who thinks the social media
is unbiased there's nobody who thinks
that
right i doubt it so if the news is fake
your social media is biased
we've also noticed that experts can be
very very wrong
very wrong list in the coronavirus
situation
we see that the polls were fake
or just very wrong okay so you've got
bad
experts bad data bad science bad news
bad social media but
the election was clean thank god
thank god the the corruption
and bias and outright criminal behavior
that is absolutely permeating
every single part of society
how lucky we were didn't touch the
election process
huh is that what you believe if you're
if you're a democrat do you believe that
everything's corrupt and you can observe
it it's pretty obvious
except the election that election
was clean do you believe that
now i did talk to even today
some democrats a democrat who
a very successful individual you know
well-informed
who believes that the news is not fake
and i thought to myself how could you
possibly have that opinion
in 2020 how could you be an adult
in 2020 and think that the news isn't
fake
which usually means they think the news
is fake on the right
but not on the left it's just
mind-boggling
that anybody would have that opinion and
still be a functioning
adult in the world anyway so ask
yourself if you believe that
in an election in which half of the
country had been
brainwashed into thinking that a racist
orange hitler was coming to a second
term
you tell me that that's the one
situation no cheating happened
all right okay
now uh the other thing that the social
media is doing
is trying to convince you that the
following things are equivalent
we have not found proof of the
allegation
therefore we've proved it isn't true
it's all over social media the
the implication that if you can't yet
prove something and the yet is important
so
if it takes a year to prove something
but it's only day one
you have not yet proved it therefore
that's proof it doesn't exist
before you've looked for it and if you
look in the wrong places
which we've seen if you look in the
wrong places and you don't find it
because it's not going to be in the
wrong places it's going to be in the
place you'd expect it to be
not in the wrong places so if you only
look in the wrong places
and you don't find it is that proof it
doesn't exist in the right place
well that's what social media is trying
to convince you all day long
the news as well so
[Music]
be wary there's a group that filed an
emergency petition in wisconsin
after identifying 144 000 potentially
fraudulent ballots
there's your kraken all right so i've
been telling you for a long time
that uh i i had some information
that i thought you would eventually see
that would be more
convincing and more credible than say a
venezuelan whistleblower
and some of the other stories and i kept
telling you
just gotta wait you haven't seen it yet
just wait
wait and what did people say to me oh
scott oh we're still waiting
we're still waiting where's the kraken
is it
is it behind me where's the kraken is it
is it in my shirt
[Laughter]
where's the kraken is it in my pocket i
don't see you cracking
no cracking skirt
and then i say well i said it might be
one or two weeks
it's been one week and one or two weeks
would include that second week a lot of
people would interpret it that way
if you say you'll see it in one or two
weeks
you're not really done in one week you
understand that right
so now we're in the second week and this
is what i was talking about
now do i believe that the court
will reverse the election nope
nope i do not believe that i do not
believe the courts
supreme court lower courts i don't
believe anybody is going to reverse the
election because
it has nothing to do with the evidence
has nothing to do with the legality of
it
has everything to do with the fact that
the courts
they like stability courts
like stability and if they see that
a case that would overthrow the election
could destroy the republic
they're just gonna ignore it
they're just gonna rule in a way that
preserves the stability
and at this point it's really really
obvious which is the
stable way forward you can see the
conservatives
are not going to the streets you see
that the right
has not revolted they have not activated
any militias they're not even close to
it
there's nothing even slightly hinting
that any of that will happen
but what would happen if the election
got reversed
you know what would happen complete
social unrest
so i don't think it matters if we find
any fraud in the election
at this point forward it will matter to
history
it will matter to our understanding of
what happened it will certainly matter
to
how we deal with future elections and
what we do to secure them
but i don't think it's not going to
matter at all to who sits in the
in the oval office in in february
so um if you are if you are
uh handicapping the odds of various
claims
i would say this is the first claim
that i would handicap as far more likely
true
than false have i said that before
i don't think so i don't believe you've
heard me say that before
because first of all the the claim is
big enough to reverse the outcome
that's important and secondly
it's uh coming with some pretty good
support
so wait and see on that
wait and see my guess is that the courts
will say
we don't want to disenfranchise people
even though
all these errors are clearly there
or yes they didn't follow their own
rules
but we don't want to disfranchise people
yes there are some indications of
specific
criminal activity but those alone
wouldn't change the election outcome so
you see where i'm going here it doesn't
matter if it's true
it doesn't even matter if the judge or
the court believes it
i think we're beyond the point where
that matters at this point
um technically there's still a path for
the president but
practically it's it's shrinking
um and then i guess nevada has some
some challenges that are looking kind of
solid i don't know as much about those
but keep an eye on my my belief
from the beginning was that the claims
you saw in the first week
were almost certainly going to be false
but if there are any real claims you
wouldn't even see them
until week two and on it would just take
a little bit longer to
make sure that you had something real so
i think that's that's what's
emerging now i asked uh in a twitter
poll
i asked in the united states how easy do
you think it would be for a
democrat-controlled city which is
important to the question
to cheat in an election and get away
with it
four percent of my respondents said that
would be impossible
and 96 said
uh probable or at least doable
so 96 of the people who answered my poll
which is very unscientific
think that it could have been done now
if it could have been done let's say
they're right just for conversation
if it could have been done and doing it
would stop hitler
was it done suppose that's all you knew
suppose you only had access to two
pieces of information
it's possible to do it
and if you did it you would stop
hitler from coming to power that's all
you know
did it happen of course it
happened
of course it happened can i take those
two pieces of
of data and take them to the courts and
get a get a ruling nope
nope and i've i used this example before
but the more i do it the more i
enjoy doing it so i'm going to do it
again
if you leave the door to the bank open
and and the safe open
and your money just hanging out and you
go home at night
and you do it every night is somebody
ever going to steal money from the bank
no cameras let's say there's no cameras
they just leave it unlocked at night
and nobody's watching no you don't need
proof to know that that bank got robbed
you don't need to see it with your own
eyes
it had to get robbed there's no way
in this world that bank doesn't get
robbed
it just can't happen so
you know with the election i acknowledge
that the proof has not been shown
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen
so i do think that every election has
cheating or here's another one somebody
somebody said well if they're if there
were cheating
and it is possible then republicans
would be doing it too
right where are all the republicans
cheating to which i say
i didn't say republicans are not
cheating
did you ever hear me say that only
democrats cheat in elections
that would be ridiculous because the
world is full of
humans a lot of humans or democrats a
lot of
humans are republicans if you have a lot
of humans
you're going to get a lot of crime you
know maybe not as a percentage but
there's plenty of people so there's
going to be plenty of crime
so um my assumption is
that there has been cheating in every
election
and that the times when the will of the
people
overcomes the cheating is when nobody
saw
how well the candidate would do so my
assumption is
that trump only won in 2016 because they
didn't know
to cheat enough they got caught
flat-footed
i'm sure there was cheating i just think
that they thought they had done enough
and they didn't
that's my guess um
all right
how much of the whole election process
do you think is visible
in other words from the entire chain of
custody
from the voting through the software
that you can't analyze
through the ballots get put on a in a
truck
transported locked in a room counted how
much of the process
is actually witnessed
what do you think if i had to guess
without knowing
anything about it just sort of living in
the world
i guess 75
maybe leaving a gigantic percentage that
isn't watched and would be subject to
mischief
all right um
so we got this national conversation
going
about whether trump will be prosecuted
after leaving
office what question have we skipped
i think we skipped the question of
guilty of what exactly
is anybody aware of a specific crime
that
trump has been accused of why are we
talking about him being prosecuted
when nobody's even mentioned an alleged
crime
are you aware of any i'm not aware of
any
so what's happening and i would say that
that fact alone
would allow trump to pardon himself
or you know put pence in charge for 24
hours
just for the purpose of pardoning trump
before
before he leaves office i think he has a
full pass to do that now
and it's because there's a national
conversation about
how to put him in jail without even an
allegation of a crime
there are allegations that you could
find a crime if you looked for one
wouldn't that be true of all of us i'll
bet i could find a crime on every one of
you if i look for it
but that's not how our system works you
have to have the evidence of the crime
first
or at least think you have the evidence
of a crime you don't talk about putting
somebody in jail before you have even uh
alleged crime so i would think that
under
this scenario the president could say
look
the whole country is talking about
putting me in jail and nobody's even
mentioned a crime
here's what i'm going to do i'm just
going to pardon myself
and we'll just be over it we'll be done
you know you know what else i'd like to
see happen
if if joe biden wants to heal the
country
and let's say let's say that trump
doesn't pardon himself
and he leaves office and he's just
exposed
if joe biden stepped up and said look
let's close this book
full pardon for everything we just don't
want to talk about trump anymore
full pardon my uh
my appreciation for biden would
completely change
completely now i still wouldn't you know
be in favor of every policy
but my my belief of who he is as a
person
and what he promised to bring would be
fulfilled
i i would say that that would be very
close to
fulfilling a campaign promise of
bringing the country together
short of that i don't think it can be
done
let me ask you this do you think the
country can come together if
anybody is prosecuting trump for
whatever probably not probably not
i think it's a minimum requirement to
even have any hope
of uh
scott's brain dead so
william comes in to make this valuable
comment
scott's brain dead goodbye william
um so
and then of course we're talking about
pardoning flynn do you think the
president should pardon flynn
before flynn has proven his innocence in
the legal process
i would say if that's the best you can
do then yes
then less then yes but
you know if if if he could win in court
that'd be great but it's pretty obvious
at this point it's just a political
prosecution
so i think the president should just do
it
just do it i don't think there i don't
have any reservation about that do you
would you have any reservation at all
even one percent
about flynn being pardoned i don't have
any i think this is
this is clean and easy and i would
expect it to happen
snowden and uh assange are
a little bit of a different situation
so i wouldn't make a prediction on that
i'd like to see it but i don't
have a prediction um
i think biden's new slogan should be
buildback boring
because he's consciously trying to make
his
uh his administration less exciting
but more competent in his opinion marco
rubio tweeted this
he said biden's cabinet picks went to
ivy league schools
have strong resumes attend all the right
conferences and will be polite
and orderly caretakers of america's
decline
[Laughter]
which is a great tweet now it was
misinterpreted in my opinion
because a lot of trolls came in and say
marco rubio
don't you realize that many of trump's
top people went to ivy league schools
including trump which is really just
misreading the tweet
i think what rubio is saying is that
he's not saying
having an ivy league education is bad
he's saying exactly the opposite well
isn't it great they've got ivy league
educations
strong resumes went to all the right
conferences he's not saying that's bad
he's saying it's not enough right
which is different than bad and i think
you'd agree it's not enough
um let's see
do you know how many people were
actually injured by fake news this year
i don't know if anybody's compiled it
but let me give you one example
um apparently and i tweeted this
a number of people did go to emergency
rooms
for drinking disinfectants drinking
bleach or drinking disinfectants
now of course the media blames trump
because they say he
noodled in public about drinking bleach
which never happened the press
completely made up this story
misinterpreting his conversation about
using
uv light injected into the body which is
a real thing that was being trialled at
the time
but they turned it into drinking bleach
which was not even close to what he was
talking about
now here's the thing do you think
that there's even one person who did
drink bleach or did
imbibe you know deadly disinfectants
do you think there's even one of them
who did that because they heard the
president only
that's all they heard they heard the
president talking
and they said oh looks like he's saying
go drink bleach
i will bet you a very large sum that a
hundred percent
a hundred percent not ninety nine
hundred 100 of the people who
drank bleach or disinfectant got injured
and had to go to the emergency room
i'll bet every one of them got that from
the fake news
every one of them
every one of those injuries is on the
fake news
all of them none of them are on trump
but
the fake news gets to decide who gets
the blame
so they're they're in the business it's
the best business model ever
they can cause the problem they can
cause the problem
and then they can assign the blame to
somebody else
for the problem they caused this is the
most perfect example
they caused people to go to the
emergency room and literally drink
 bleach
after they drank it they did that and
they
and they assigned it to trump and it and
it and it worked
it worked trump actually lost the
election
probably at least in part because of
that
that belief that that he wanted to
consider drinking bleach which of course
never happened
now a lot of people when i say this on
twitter
as richard fowler said on the five and
uh
and even i think anderson cooper said it
on cnn a few weeks ago
they actually believed they heard the
president
suggest drinking bleach he never used
either of those words
never used drinking never used bleach
and yet there it is on cnn just like
it's a fact
all right so that's what cnn did
but at the same time we
see that there's some legal settlement
it looks like the fox news has settled
because hannity was talking about seth
rich
now apparently i'll get banned if i say
any more about that topic than i already
have
so i will just say this isn't hannity an
opinion show
how do you get sued for an opinion
because can't your opinion be wrong i
don't think you could get sued for an
opinion can you
so that's my first question how in the
world
does an opinion person get sued at all
for an opinion it doesn't seem like that
should even be legal
but secondly why is it that
the cnn is not being sued for this story
about the bleach
because hannity at least had
he had an argument you know
that doesn't mean it's true because
opinions are not about
truth necessarily but the bleach thing
can be true
can be proven beyond any doubt you just
have to look at it
see the transcript and know that this
light
therapy existed it was a real thing
so this doesn't seem like equal
treatment
to me it looks like fox news is being
singled singled out in this case
i don't know the details i could be
wrong on that all right
um uh
let's see here's how the language is
being misused
unproven is turned into baseless
in the news and then baseless is turned
into proven false
it's like they're they're laundering the
news
so this is the laundering process so
you've got some claims
let's say a claim that the election was
fraudulent and then you can say that's
unproven
which is true so so far you're right
you're you're
you're in good place then you change
that just a little bit
unproven is that exactly the same as
baseless
because something could have some claims
some base
but still be unproven but then you get
it all the way to baseless
and does baseless sound like unproven it
doesn't does it
when you hear when you hear unproven you
think to yourself
well it could be true just unproven
but as soon as you hear it as baseless
baseless is almost a claim that the base
can't exist and doesn't exist
it's different from unproven
so once you get all the way to baseless
it's a very
short step over to proven false
so it starts with unproven moves to
baseless
and from baseless moves to oh it's
proven that it's false
and none of that actually happens
all right um
uh dave chappelle actually did something
kind of awesome and it
affects me you know i always tell you
that
i have this strange life where you watch
the news and you're just watching the
news
but when i watch the news half the time
it's somebody i just talked to
yeah like i was just talking to you and
there you are in the news
so so the world looks like weird and
small to me because the people on the
news are the people i know personally
so so it just shrinks my world but
here's another one that
directly affects me so dave chappelle
asked netflix
to take his old dave chappelle
comedy special off their service
now why would dave chappelle ask netflix
to remove
his to no i'm sorry to remove dave
chappelle
content from netflix why would he do
that
now he he's not unproud of the work
so it has nothing to do with whether he
liked his own work
so he's not he's not like embarrassed at
his work it was
great work yeah he wasn't getting paid
for it
because hollywood has these uh these uh
let's say i don't want to say fraudulent
because
your lawyer gets to look at them too
let's say they're very
uh unfair contracts
in which they say hey here's the deal
we're going to pay you this much money
when you're making the show
after the show is done we're going to
run it in
reruns we'll sell it to different
services and we'll take that money and
we'll split it with you
and you say to yourself sounds good to
me
i'll get money up front i'll get money
while i'm doing it
and then after it's done and it's in
syndication or whatever
i'll share the money that's what my
contract says
but the contract also says after
expenses
so the publisher gets to deduct their
expenses
from the revenue and then they say ah
darn our expenses were so high
it erased the revenue so the amount we
have to share with you dave chappelle is
is zero again and dave chappelle might
be thinking to himself um how much work
did you do because
i don't think i don't think the owner of
the copyright whoever owned the actual
show
content i don't think they did any extra
work except a lawyer
said netflix you can use this and give
us money
but for that you kept all of the money
and what are these expenses that you had
one lawyer doing one deal once
that's it and i can get no money forever
after that
well of course the trick is that the
expenses that they say
are being applied to you are general
expenses for the company
so the way they do the fraud and i'll
call it a fraud even though
your lawyer gets to look at it and they
know what's happening
the the fraud is that you imagine you
could get money in the future and there
isn't any way that can happen
because they can game the system
indefinitely they do
it's a well-known fact so chappelle goes
to netflix and says
you know given that he's doing current
work for netflix so he has a
relationship with him
he says you know i don't make any money
from this
do you think that was fair do you think
that it's fair that i dave chappelle
get zero money for the dave chappelle
show that you're showing on netflix do
you think that makes sense
and netflix to their credit
said no they said no or at least they
decided they wanted their relationship
with chappelle to last
now why is this relevant to me because
i'm in the same
situation if you've watched the dilbert
animated tv show you may have seen it on
hulu
i don't know which services are running
if any at the moment but it ran for
years
quite a few years in reruns how much
money
did i get for the property i created and
worked so hard on
after i was no longer actively working
on it
and the answer is none none
zero so i would also like to ask
and i will ask that now if there are any
platforms running the dilbert animated
tv show
i'd like to ask you to remove them
because i don't get any money for it do
you think that's fair
that i get no money i'm talking about no
money
now let me be more specific there is a
ongoing
writing fee that you get if you also
were a writer
and that fee could be like uh three
dollars
a year because it goes down every year
so you get checks for like a dollar and
two dollars per show
that sort of thing
so if if that uh runs i don't know where
it used to run on crackle and
at one point hulu had it i don't know if
they have it anymore so i don't know
which platforms have it
but i'm asking as as the creator of
dilbert
i'm publicly asking you right now if you
run that show
consider taking it off your platform
because
it's it's really a product of crime in
my opinion
legal crime it's legal
but in concept it's a crime
conceptually somebody says it's free on
youtube
uh is that true the dilbert
animated tv show is free on youtube i
think clips are there
and i don't mind if there's a cool clip
or so
but i don't think the entire episodes
are there if they are
if they are we'll fix that
um you guys need to do better at
contracting
so that's a perfectly reasonable
uh statement so when you hear this don't
you say to yourself
what kind of a bad lawyer do you have
scott
you know do you have the world's worst
lawyer did dave chappelle
get screwed because he didn't get a
lawyer is that what happened
let me assure you that everybody has the
same deal
if you go to hollywood and say i'm going
to be the one
i know you've been doing this to
everybody else but i'm going to be the
one who doesn't sign that stupid
contract
i'm going to be the one who is not going
to get screwed that way
so here's the deal you do it my way and
i get money
after the fact you know for the ongoing
syndication
or or i'm out i'm not going to sign this
contract at all
what does hollywood say okay
nice knowing you you can't get a
contract without signing that
and it's because there's a uh let's say
a monopoly if you will
if if anybody ever signed a contract all
everybody else would have to to do the
same so
there is a pr there is a rock solid
precedent
that nobody will make that deal with you
you could be
you could be seinfeld i think i don't
know for sure
but i think you could be seinfeld and
have the strongest lawyer in the world
and go in and say look
i'm seinfeld i'm not going to sign that
deal with all the sucker sign
i'm seinfeld
and my guess is that even he couldn't
get that deal i think he could not get
that deal
i don't know but i think he could not
now seinfeld got rich in syndication
because he owned the show and when it's
originally sold into syndication
you get a ton of money and i would have
too so if the tv show had gone into
syndication
then i would have gotten a big check but
i wouldn't have gotten
much after that
does anybody ask yeah of course you
don't think that
my lawyer tried to get that taken out of
the contract
i i had one of the top lawyers in
hollywood like
somebody who was literally a legend
as a hollywood lawyer for this kind of
deal
he was like the one of the strongest
best lawyers
for exactly this he couldn't get it done
not only could he get it not get it done
but he told me don't even don't even
bother trying because it's not going to
happen
um
no you're not going to guess who it is
so don't guess
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
all right you youtubers you have my full
attention
i'm just looking at some of your uh
comments
you're welcome um
does biden pardoning trump negate your
animus toward him for calling you
a nazi uh that's a good question
i it would not make me hate
biden less for that that's true
it would make me appreciate that he made
a campaign promise
that he was doing a real thing about it
but no i would not forgive that that
that's a
good question is sydney powell the mole
well you know i i saw a tweet yesterday
from
lynn linwood so
the another lawyer working on the same
election fraud issues
lynnwood tweeted something that was so
key and on crazy
that i just said to myself oh i thought
he was a serious lawyer
and maybe he gets results seems seems to
have gotten some kind of result for
kyle rittenhouse wasn't that his client
but
there does seem to be a problem with
believing things that are clearly not
true
that does seem to be a problem with a
few of the attorneys
um so we'll we'll see
yeah somebody in the comments is saying
that lin and sydney both got
duped by q it looks like that
that's what it looks like
will you be leaving california well you
know i've got
maybe too many connections here and i
like the weather
i will definitely be in the group of
people who are looking at it as
seriously
leaving california possibly
you know there might be some life things
that happen that could make that happen
what's a linguistic kill shot for the
lockdowns
oh that's a good question i haven't
thought about that
but um i i can tell you
that i haven't been the anti-lockdown
guy
and it's only because that requires a
level of
certainty that i can't get to because
certainly the lockdowns have a place
i just don't know you know where's the
where's the line where do you draw the
line
uh organized somebody says the same
fraud happened in israel
seven months ago i don't know which
fraud you're talking about election
fraud
i don't know that story
um
could i live anywhere with a private
landing strip well you know
christina uh got her pilot's license
and is working right now on her uh
her instrument flying rating
so she'll be able to fly just about
anywhere her plane can take her
if she's you know checked out on that
that exact plane
um
so daniel says he wore gloves to fill
his gas tank definitely not gonna
be against the lockdown well i don't
wear gloves to fill my tank now
but in the early days as a risk
management
decision i decided well it's not the
biggest inconvenience temporarily
so i'll treat it like it's true even if
i don't know it
even if i don't know which parts are
important
prescott arizona has the most flying
days in the country
that's good to know would you believe i
asked that very question of
christina the other day and we didn't
know
i thought it would be too hot in arizona
because some of the planes the uh the
air the aerobic planes don't have
uh air conditioning all right if
somebody says a1 shredding in georgia
look into it i believe that's already
been debunked
what they were shredding was not ballots
so
look for the debunk on that story that
you just mentioned
everybody's telling me about a1
shredding um
i i saw a headline that said it was
debunked so
if you have not seen that headline take
a look
alright that's all i got for now i will
talk to you tomorrow
