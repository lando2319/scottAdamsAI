[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams because
that's what we're going to do and it's a
Sunday Funday where the news is all more
laughable than serious and all you need
to do to take this day up to a level
that nobody can even understand with
their puny human brains all you need is
a CER muger a glass of CH a tankered
shells just and a canteen suer flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dope Bean end of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go well that's some good stuff right
there well it's happening it's happening
people uh thanks to the prince of fakes
or also known as
bri. on the xplatform there is now a uh
AI that is built on my
personality I don't know if it's my
personality or just my voice but I
listen to uh the creator of it have a
conversation with me well I wasn't
there
now I think this this uh idea of having
the ability to irritate anybody's voice
really has some legs
because if you have not heard the the
mashup of uh yeah if you if you haven't
heard Tucker Carlson it's a fake AI
voice of Tucker Carlson uh talking about
the uh the Lord of the Rings
trilogy except reporting it in his
Tucker Carlson way it might be the
funniest thing I've ever seen right it's
almost incapacitating it's so funny so
look at look for that in I I just posted
that before I got on here you know what
I
miss I don't know if you miss it I miss
information do you remember when we used
to think that you would get information
I miss it and now instead of missing
information I have
misinformation that's all I have it's
all
misinformation I love how how language
evolves I go from missing the
information to hey that's misinformation
okay I guess I'll ignore it
anyway
um this first story is in the category
of you know I always suspected that
might be the case are you ready for this
after after I tell you the story I want
you to say silently to yourself you know
that's exactly what I might have
suspected might
happen there's a company named a vast
that sold privacy software so software
to help you get more
privacy uh then allegedly they sold the
users's
information that's right
allegedly it was a software to help you
protect your privacy but they were just
harvesting your personal information
selling it now can you honestly say
you've never you've never thought once I
wonder if this is a trick have any of
you ever bought anti irus software and
thought to
yourself who makes all this software or
who makes all these viruses that's a lot
of work to put in to make a virus for
what reason I don't know but I always
suspected yeah I always suspected McAfee
might not be just the person who stops
viruses if you know what I
mean I have no information to back up
that allegation but I always just wonder
it'd be a little bit easy to create the
problem you're
solving just makes you scratch your
head well let's talk about Trump's big
victory
um so uh so we'll talk about South
Carolina but uh take a look at how Trump
um at CAC uh just recently here's his
latest framing of his
revenge he said quote the unprecedented
success of the United States of America
will be my ultimate and absolute Revenge
so he's very committed to that reframe
which is brilliant because it just uh he
basically he took away their entire
argument correct me if I'm wrong but
from the moment the that Trump said his
revenge would be
success did the bad guys stop harping on
it they did didn't they if it just went
cold have you ever seen that done before
have you ever seen a reframe just take a
story completely out of the news because
the big story was hey he's G he said
he's going to be a dictator and he's
going to get a bunch of
Revenge and then he just reframes it and
they're like never mind never mind we
don't want to talk about that
anymore well a commentator analyst on
CNN called uh Trump win in South
Carolina and I guess maybe his whole Arc
the greatest political comeback of all
time in
CNN now do you what what's the other way
to refer to the greatest comeback of all
time huh is there another
phrase that anybody's oh there it is
yeah the third act the third act here it
is
here it
is you know the third act will not be
complete unless and
until uh it looks like the 2020 election
was rigged and there's you know evidence
that people
believe that would be the ultimate
revenge or ultimately if he doesn't
prove it imagine if Trump could get a
majority of the people in the country to
think it was rigged whether or not we
could prove it or not wouldn't that be
amazing imagine that imagine if Trump
could get a majority of
people to say that the election was
rigged I mean that would be hard to do
wouldn't
it uh my next story is that the voters
in South Carolina 70% of them thought
the election was
rigged
huh versus
75 okay okay sure well looks like that
third Act is looking looking pretty
good um but people have different
opinions about how massive this victory
was uh was it really the big the big
third act or was it underwhelming
because they thought he would do better
well Ian Bremer says uh it's a big win
for Trump in South Carolina the GOP
nomination is his but it's much worse
performance than the polls
predicted because so many in the GOP
don't want him M well I see I see the
point it did suggest that 40% of the
voters uh were voting for somebody else
you we don't know how many of them were
actually Democrats who were allowed to
vote if they hadn't voted in the
Democratic primary I guess so it's a
little unclear just how clean that
number is but uh I would I would advise
Ian Bremer that that's not really
telling you what you think it is because
of the stage of the election we're in I
don't think it matters one bit the 40%
of the primary voters voted for somebody
who wasn't Trump do you know
why I just keep saying this every time
he
runs he he doesn't have to outrun the
other campers he only has to outrun the
Bear right so the only thing that
matters is if people prefer Trump let's
say Republicans because they're the you
know the ones who have to vote for them
and show
up it only matters if they prefer Trump
over squinty MC shuffled
dead that's right I'm trying out a new
nickname squinty MC shuffled
dead I think that covers everything he
Squints he shuffles he looks dead
squinty MC Shuffle
dead try it it really rolls off the
tongue I was trying to make it shuffle
um squinty MC dementia but MC dementia I
don't know your your tongue just trips
over that a little bit but Mick Shuffle
dead you can't tell me you don't want to
say that at home say it say it out loud
Mick Shuffle dead squinty MC Shuffle
dead you like it I know you like it
it'll catch it it'll catch on with
you well we you know there's a quite a
bit of mystery here because uh CNN is
really confused why they've tried so
hard to turn Trump into some kind of a
insurrectionist racist monster and the
yeti just becomes more popular and it's
very very confusing and watching them
try to figure it out is quite quite
entertaining um but one of the things
they get a little uh push back for I'm
seeing a lot of people push back the
NAACP is on the top of the list uh
they're pushing back at the
idea and it's really racist and
offensive they
say that Trump would indicate that maybe
he's more popular with black
voters because he was um indicted so
many times and and that that might uh
and that he has a good
mugshot and the NAACP points out and I
think they make a good point it's very
insulting very insulting to imagine that
black voters are going to Black are
going to more support Trump because he's
he's been accused of criminal activity
very very racist racist
unless unless you realize that the
entire Democrat
Party is really unified only by one
thing the fact that they assert they're
all
victims otherwise there's nothing that
unifies them right like what do the
liberal single women and the you know
the black voters who are Democrats what
do they have in common well what they
have in common is they all feel their
victims so Trump who has
91 91 indictments against him that every
reasonable person thinks look like
 do you think nobody's noticed
that these charges look a little bit
overdone do do you think there's nobody
in Black America who's noticed that 91
indictments on things that do look like
 to
anybody they haven't noticed that does
the N NAACP think that the the real
thing is doing the
crime the the thing that he he may I
mean this would be the
theory he might get a little extra
credit for being falsely accused isn't
falsely accused the thing the bigger
thing yeah I think falsely accused and
targeted by the the justice system is a
pretty strong thing to bond
on
absolutely because I find that I bond
with anybody who is blamed of the same
things I'm blamed for so anybody who got
cancelled I'm automatically you know
more likely to support them and it's not
because I agree with everything they've
ever said I haven't even checked I don't
know do I agree with everything
Roseanne's ever said I don't know I
don't know but I definitely bond with
her over getting cancelled do do I agree
with uh you everything uh I don't Steve
Bannon or Peter Navaro or anybody else
said I don't know but I bond with them
for being cancelled for sure and same
thing with
Trump so maybe maybe people are looking
at the the fact that the justice system
is after him
maybe but uh the theme for today's uh
show will be uh I wonder why Trump did
so well how in the world is he doing so
well with this great comeback that's
kind of a miracle even CNN so let's see
if we can examine the news and see if we
can find any little whiff maybe a little
hint just a suggestion of anything that
could solve this mystery of why Trump
would be doing better than people
expected on CNN what could it be well
I'm looking at politico's headlines um
10 ways a second Trump term could be
more extreme than the
first huh I wonder if people have
noticed that the news stopped being the
news and turned into complete
of
propaganda do you do you think anybody's
noticed
anybody I wonder if anybody's noticed
that possible um why do you think
Politico says there that Trump term
could be more
extreme why why would he use that word
more more
extrem well it's a scary word yeah it's
like dark ah now you see it don't you
yeah it's an agreed upon term like chaos
dark chaos
extreme do you know why they would say
extreme why wouldn't you say his
policies are bad and if he implements
them they will have bad
outcomes do you know why they don't say
that because even his enemies don't
believe it let me say that again dog not
barking they had to give 10 reasons he's
more
extreme but how about 10 reasons he
would do bad things that would be bad
for the country or how about 10 bad
policies do you know why they don't say
that because they don't believe
it no it might be extreme but it might
not be a problem is it extreme to say
that you want to I don't know get rid of
the Department of Education sure you
could call that extreme is it a bad idea
no no
is it extreme that you might get uh you
know a little bit more militaristic with
the
cartels well if it works a lot of people
are going to think that's a good idea is
it extreme well by modern standards it
would be is it a bad idea probably not
probably not so they actually have to
invent a whole new word to insult them I
mean the word existed but they had to
they had to Port a word from other
contexts into politics just have
something to complain about because they
couldn't find something wrong with his
policies they had to come up with him
extreme and I don't even dislike
extreme I kind of feel like a little bit
of extreme could be just about the right
thing
well let's see uh what else
um uh van Jones uh on CNN
uh one of the explanations he had for
why things are looking the way they are
and especially the why the reason that
black voters seem to be more favorable
to Trump this
time so fan Jones had a pretty good um
hypothesis he thinks the reason that
black voters are more uh more liking
Trump is that uh Russia China and Iran
are working online to influence black
men to vote against Joe
Biden so I wonder if anybody
noticed the
pattern has anybody noticed the pattern
of blaming Russia in
particular for anything that's not going
the way that CNN thinks it should go
this would be the 12th hoax from CNN
just about Russia I'm not talking about
all their hoaxes I'm talking about one
little narrow area of hoaxes this would
literally be the 12th I actually counted
them
up I mean I have them on list and I I
know when I say that if you're if you're
new to this you're thinking well there's
not 12 of them there couldn't be 12 just
Russia
hoaxes could there well there was the
original Russia collusion hoax they had
about three sub hoaxes to it there was
Russian bounties on American soldiers
there was a hunter laptop was Russian
disinformation there was Trump was
responsible for nalan's death there was
Trump invited Russia to attack n NATO
there's the FBI informant uh that uh
turned out to be the most credible
person except when he said something
they didn't want to hear and then it was
a Russian misinformation and then there
was Putin blew up his own pipeline there
was Trump is romantically attracted to
Putin he has some kind of weird
connection to him there's Russia is
behind the anti- uh vax movement um I
missed I wrote that as anti-tax there's
the alpha Bank hoax number 10 there's a
Hamilton to 68 hoax number 11 and folks
number 12 is Van Jones saying that
Russia is working online to influence
black men to vote for
Biden what evidence do you think there
is of
that
evidence I'm not sure I've seen any I
don't know that he offer off any did he
offer any evidence I lik that he threw
China and Iran in there because yeah
they're all working
together so even though Putin says that
he would prefer Biden as president you
don't know if that's a trick so keep an
eye on
that um an MSNBC analyst Claire mccal uh
she was a former Democrat um
Senator she actually she actually said
this on
MSNBC and of course Jonathan tlee and a
lot of other people are calling around
I'll let me just read it quote Claire
masy says MLL says can I make a
suggestion I move that every newspaper
in America quits doing any fact checks
on Joe
Biden what until they fact check Donald
Trump every morning on the front page it
is ridiculous that the the New York
Times fact check Joe Biden on something
I mean he vomits lies Trump vomits lies
and he every day over and over again and
it's just ridiculous that the New York
Times is doing it fact Shack on Biden
what what well well they LED Trump
they're numb they're numb to the current
the Tor of Lies coming in
[Music]
TR I was trying to read it in
character now I did a little uh test
on my X feed um you might know that I
was trying to see if I've been
completely walled off from all Democrat
viewers and so and so I posted uh that
batshit crazy women have total control
of the democratic
party and I said none of this looks like
politics to me it looks like organized
mental
illness now imagine that I'd said that
to a mixed audience of Democrats and
Republicans can you imagine what the
response would
be I mean I just said the most sexist
political thing you could ever
say that batshit crazy women have total
control of the Democrat
party so it was a test do you know what
the test the test was to see if I have
any Democrats reading my stuff and I
checked my
comments I didn't have a single negative
comment
none now does that mean that everybody
agrees with me that uh that the Democrat
Party is controlled by bad crazy
women well most of the Republicans
do but I think I proved I don't have any
Democrat
viewership I am I'm completely siloed
off and I don't know if musk is aware of
this I don't know if he's aware of it
now it could be it could be that I've
been w off for a long time and the only
traffic I saw was trolls and it could be
that the only thing that changed is that
the trolls are more easily identified
and and removed from the system so I
might not be seeing any change at all
except for the paid professional trolls
who come over in waves
maybe but what it feels like to me is
that X is uh
captured now I'm not going to say it is
because I don't have any proof of that
but it actually like it is I can't
believe that I lost all
Democrat related even nobody even leans
Democrat and follows my ex account there
they're 1.1 million people and nobody's
going to complain that I just said the
Democrat Party looks like it's led by
bat she crazy
women
nobody would you agree with me do you
agree with me with my uh
hypothesis that it's not because
everybody agreed with it it's because
they didn't see
it wouldn't you say so um I would
request that Elon Musk if he has a way
to do it look into to see if there's any
kind of force that is siloing people
like me now it could be that when I got
cancelled you know just all the
Democrats unfollowed
maybe maybe but that would be unusual
behavior I wouldn't expect it
so um let's see and by the way I think I
I said it to partly test response but I
think it's true I think that if you
remove the batshit crazy women and I
mean that I don't mean that in a
political sense I mean it looks like
mental illness to me you get that I'm
not using hyperbole right I mean I use
hyperboy but in this case I mean
actually it looks like mental illness
and I don't mean that just to be Poli
iCal that's what it actually looks like
now TDs is one thing but it's deeper
than that I mean the the fact
that I mean you just have to look at the
policy preferences and say to yourself
okay there's something crazy going on
here all right uh Joe Biden's bragging
about his student loading forgiveness uh
he says uh nearly 800,000 people have
had their debt forgiven and uh nearly 81
million people said f you Joe Joe Biden
uh you did not forgive any debt you just
transferred it to people who didn't get
the benefit of going to college which is
what he did
largely um sure it's a life changing
change so I wonder why uh I wonder why
Trump is doing so
well trying
to trying trying to figure out if
there's any kind of hint well it could
be that the Democrats just stole money
from the people who didn't go to college
and gave it to the people who
did could be that it could be that
maybe um or well let's look at what else
the media is up to uh um wired you know
wired the
publication um so eight years ago they
uh worried that California is becoming
too dry because of climate
change and they just published a story
they're concerned that California is
becoming too wet because of climate
change so one of the problems with
climate change is it made California too
dry but also too
wet now I wonder if when Trump says the
news is fake and climate change is a
hoax I wonder if any of that's starting
to have an impact on
people because you know the media is
telling you that Trump's a terrible
monster and people are reading this
media
they should believe it I mean think of
the things they've told you that are all
true they told you climate change caused
too much drying they told you it caused
too much rain and they also told you
Trump is a dictator and probably a
racist so if you look at the three
things that they said that are
completely true why wouldn't you trust
the
media all right by the way I didn't make
that uh observation myself but it looks
like I'm a terrible person I forgot to
credit the person who made the
observation that wired so I apologize
but on X I think I probably uh posted it
all right um end wokeness which is a
great account you should follow on X end
wokness uh points out
that the uh the Supreme Court in New
York looks like they have five members
if I counted right and all five members
of the Supreme Court of New York are
black and women they're black and
women what are the odds of that well and
wokness stood a little math for us and I
think he determined that uh 1.5% of
lawyers are black
women 1.5% but yet 100% of the New York
state supreme court is black women H
interesting now imagine if you were a
Republican
and you lived in a country that told you
that if you supported uh Trump or you
were Trump that you were a horrible
horrible racist probably a dictator uh a
lot of chaos and maybe extreme how would
you feel if after years of the media
telling people that that's a fact not
just an opinion but it's a fact and then
you go in front of the New York state
supreme court that by weird coincidence
and I'm not suggesting that that the
these were not the most qualified people
in the entire state of New York but but
of course they were uh and which is a
miracle given the numbers but uh I would
not expect a fair
hearing from five people who had been
targeted to be hypnotized into believing
that I'm the problem not just with
whatever they're looking at in their you
know if they're looking at a specific
case but also in General on the problem
so I would suggest that if you're a
white male you should get the out
of New York because you don't have a
chance yeah so it looks like the the New
York has gone complete
racist without any apology
whatsoever complete racist and then they
hypnotized themselves into hating white
people um yeah you should just get out
of
there it looks like too late to fix it I
would really get out of there I wouldn't
do any business in New York if if you're
white and
male all right now how fascinated are
you that I can say that casually and
publicly that's that's different isn't
it I I can casually and publicly and
without any shame at all tell you that
if you're white and male you should not
do business in New York because they've
created a racist system that's
absurd and if you get anywhere near that
thing you should Escape like literally
move that's not hyperboy you should
move listen to Kevin o he'll tell
you well now we've got this case I guess
we know that one of the people
Prosecuting Trump funny Willis appears
to have lied on official government
documents about her relationship with
her uh subordinate
Wade uh but he apparently she was
waiting onto his Willis a little bit
more than that's right she was waiting
onto his
Willis um a little bit more often than
she said or for a longer time period And
so Jonathan toally points out that she's
now Prosecuting Trump for the exact
crime that she just committed and we can
all say
it I wonder I wonder if anybody else
noticed is it possible
that people think that Trump is being
unfairly treated h i I don't know
anybody how anybody could come to that
conclusion so CNN is very
puzzled how how people could think maybe
there's something wrong and maybe Trump
could fix
it Mike Benz had a great idea he said we
need a sanctuary state for conservatives
now that is an extreme idea Mike he's
extreme extreme
it's a good idea and I'm 100% in favor
of it but let me tell you let me tell
you it's
extreme in a good way uh yes this is not
hyperbole I 100% completely seriously
believe that it would be useful for uh
some state to become a sanctuary City
for republicans and anybody who's being
abused by the Department of Justice
because
you know we don't have to talk
theoretically or hypothetically about
the weaponization of the Department of
Justice it is now weaponized it's
weaponized it's done right so
yes um some people are going to need to
escape and I I would love the option of
literally just just packing up the car
and moving there and just being safe and
maybe you'd never be able to leave the
state
you know because if you went back to
your state you get picked up but as long
as you don't go back to the
state maybe you'd be
okay um well here's something else that
probably completely confused CNN um 53%
of Jewish voters in New York state plan
on voting for
Trump
53% of Jewish
voters in New York
state The Bluest of the blue plan to
vote for Trump I wonder if it had
anything to do with anything that's been
in the news
lately has anything
happened that would make people a little
more Pro Trump about the news could it
be about
Israel yeah I think that might have
gotten you a few Jewish voters by not
being a anti-israel at the you know
within just a few months of October 7th
probably a bad idea to to take that
stance so yeah Biden's got a little
trouble
there um let's see if we can look for
more clues why the country might be
turning more favorably to uh Trump well
here's the story let's see if we can
find anything in this we'll dig down a
little bit uh
Reuters uh has fired a data scientist
and the data scientist uh apparently is
problem was he did some research for
writers and he said that cops kill more
unarmed white people than unarmed black
people and that got him uh bullied but
uh that didn't get him fired until he
said that black lives matter contributed
to the deaths of thousands of black
citizens well that'll get you fired
that'll get you fired so he says this is
his claim you know you have to be
careful of a disgruntled employee claim
but his claim is that he was bullied in
fire
for having accurate information about
the world so
writers a organization whose job is I
think to give you correct information do
I have that
right it's been a while but but
Reuters is their that's their model
right they're in the model of giving you
correct information but they had a guy
who some white guy who found some
correct information they're like what we
got to get rid of that right away so
allegedly
I you have to be careful you know one
person's account of
something so that you Daily Mail
reported that it could have something to
do with people's opinions you know
stories like that well CNN sent a news
crew um no it wasn't CNN it was uh 60
Minutes send a news crew over to
Sweden to do a little special about uh
you know all their new diversity and the
uh migrant situation and things were
going well and they were talking to
people and Gathering some information
but at some point they had a police
escort why why did 60 Minutes need a
police escort to go into the middle of a
major Swedish
City they don't say but they had a
police escort and the police escort for
whatever reason
left and they were surrounded by African
migrants and attacked
immediately so I don't know can you
think of anything that would make Trump
more
popular that's happening in the
news well I don't see anything in that
story so let's keep
moving we're look remember we're looking
for little hints of why any reason the
Trump would be gaining in popularity
we're I'm not seeing much uh let's see
there's a story by amuse on the
xplatform says the FBI is doing an event
through recruiting well good that's good
because the FBI is going to need new
people you always need new
blood so they're hosting a uh an
invitation only hiring event well that's
good because you don't want like just
everybody come and by so it's Invitation
Only hiring event uh for women and uh
people of color oh okay so white men are
not allowed to go to the Invitational
event to get a job at the FBI
but we're not I'm just not getting any
hints why Trump is getting more popular
all of a sudden
though all right well we're going to
keep looking see if we can find anything
in the news that would just like be a
whisper a suggestion a hint what what
could it
be um I mentioned that 70% of the people
in South Carolina believe Joe Biden did
not win in
2020 um and CNN when I talked about it
their political analyst guy uh he said
this he said the
CNN um the 70% thought that Biden didn't
win and then he said that quote only a
third give the correct answer to this
question
so a strong two-thirds majority believes
that Trump actually did win and it was
robbed from
him despite watching CNN all day long
who is telling you exactly the opposite
because that's the wrong answer people
that's the wrong answer so the fact that
um a third only onethird of the people
in South Carolina can correctly know
what's happening according to
CNN okay again I'm coming up with
nothing I'm look what we're looking here
is for reasons that people would like
trumps and like what's changed I'm not
getting anything I'm just coming up with
dry hole after dry hole
um rasmuson is reporting that uh the
pollsters did a great job in South
Carolina and they're giving them some
credit which is I think that's very nice
to them because rasmason competes
competes with all the other pollsters so
for them to compliment them on such a
good job I think that's very big of them
so they said did a great job they were
very close to the actual outcome of the
election um the way Ras report says is
how did all these top pollsters come so
close in South Carolina last night but
they totally missed their Georgia Final
estimat in
2022 so in 2022 they were way
off
huh so that's weird because they're so
good now but I mean that was only two
years ago but probably they just got a
lot better that's probably what happened
and again once again we see no reason
to see any reason anybody would prefer
Trump because everything is working so
well and so
credible I saw Mike cernovich post today
that if Naval were American he would be
in prison for a January 6
offense well that's probably true I mean
that sounds right but again we're
looking for reasons people would be
favoring Trump anything in the news and
nothing I'm getting
nothing well uh Trump meet met uh
Argentina's melee they had a warm
embrace and I guess V was with them they
had a good meeting there and people are
very happy about melee because they
remind people of trump you know populace
partly melee has already balanced the
budget in Argentina something that
people said was
impossible so let's see m is doing doing
things that remind people of trump he's
already done a miracle in just a few
days in Argentina Trump and he get along
great and he fixed everything in
Argentina and he's a lot like Trump okay
again I'm coming up with blanks why why
is Trump getting more
popular is anybody seeing it
yet it's like invisible to me I I can't
see
it huh okay
uh here's a story by uh an account named
name name redacted that's the account on
X um is talking about how Google and
meta are an extension of the US
intelligence Community well I think
that's a little going too far that's
that's a little too far I wouldn't say
that Google and meta are like an
extension of the Intel Community that's
I mean that's a little
crazy um well well it is true that uh
Google's head of trust and safety and uh
Mead's head of Elections and content
they're both career CIA officers but I
don't think you can make much from you
know two
people like you know it's not that
unusual that somebody worked in one
place and then they go work at another
place let's not make a big deal about
where they used to work
okay uh since 2018 also seeing this on
the name redacted um here are the number
of peoples each of them have hired so
this be the number of people from that
intelligence Community oh so it's not
just two okay maybe I misled you it's
not just two that are in the most
important jobs there but Google and meta
has hired some other people um from the
CIA CIA for example they got 36 people
36 people hired from the CIA since
2018 but that's not really a lot when
you consider the size of Google and the
size of meta 36 people that's not a
lot they got 68 from the FBI the same
period all all right so that's you know
over 100 but but that's not a lot of
people when you look at the whole size
of those organizations the NSA gave him
44 the DHS sisa 68 State Department 86
and the Department of Defense
121 well that's a lot of people that's
that's a lot of people all from one one
area of the world the intelligence
community so but once
again is an interesting story a whole
bunch of coincidences but I don't see
anything in this story that would
suggest that you would need some kind of
populist president to clean things up do
you see anything like I'm getting blacks
nothing um all
right Robert Kennedy who I guess is
running as an independent
um he says that the polls say that he
would win in a three-way
contest and he says that the South
Carolina uh result proves that you know
it's a three-way
contest so what do you think will be the
treatment of RFK Jr by Google and
meta let's
see he alleges that the intelligence
Community killed his
uncle and his father and might kill him
because he can't get any um secret
service protection even though the woman
who just lost and is certainly not going
to be president was uh she got some and
then the biggest information companies
in the world are now staffed with the
very people he would worry the most
about yeah I don't see any problem there
moving on all right so basically
um I think it's very
confusing why Trump is becoming so
popular just because we're positive at
this point that climate change was fake
or at least the alarm part of it just
because the public doesn't trust the
elections in
general just because the intelligence
people seem to have taken over not only
the mainstream media but major platforms
I don't think that's enough
just because we're in wars that appear
to be optional and for the benefit of
who knows what just because we're being
spent into total
Oblivion just because the a wokeness has
reached a level of absurdity that you
can only laugh at at this point to the
point where leaving is your best
option huh I wonder what it could be
could it be the 91 indictments that are
clearly what could it be well I
guess we're going to have to leave that
mystery for later but for now ladies and
gentlemen I suggest that this would be
time to go enjoy your Sunday I'm going
to make it a little short today because
there's nothing in the news except bad
behavior and watch out for the batshit
crazy women because um the fact that I
can say that without any push back is
really amazing for two reasons one
because of the
but also I don't think anybody
disagreed I don't think they
did and I would go further and say that
the Democrat Party became the party that
you can't uh talk to honestly and that
was the
problem really it's the whole problem
there there aren't that many problems
you can't solve if you have free speech
you know free speech is the number one
thing and if you create a an entire
political party whose entire um
character depends on not being able to
listen to other points of view because
it would destroy their Narrative of
victimization then you get here you get
to exactly where we are there's no
surprise our systems are designed to do
what they're doing now you say to
yourself but what is their intention I
don't know I just know that the design
of the system is guaranteed to remove
any useful information from the news
you you can tell that's a fact so I
would assume it's designed for that
right it's designed to do what it's
doing it doesn't matter what people
thought when they designed it the design
is your destiny it's going to do what
the design drives it to do our current
design guarantees that the intelligence
communities run the
country and it guarantees that the
cartels will have free reign because
did what what do you think about the
fact that Ken
Paxton attorney general for Texas um his
framing is that uh Biden is in
partnership with the cartels now what he
means is that the border is open right
that he's not going too much further
than that I'm going much further I'm
saying that there's only one explanation
for what we see if somebody wants to
offer a second explanation I'm all ears
would love to be wrong and find out that
our intelligence people are not actively
partnering with the cartels I would love
to find out that they don't
intentionally let them bring in drugs
and traffic and you know traffic in
humans as well uh because they're
getting some other
benefit today
coincidentally I I saw a story that said
the cartels have started to violate
their own Unwritten Rule and they
started to do some violence around the
uh Resort
industry huh
interesting so apparently the story says
that the cartels have killed some people
near around Resorts and that they used
to have an Unwritten agreement that they
stayed away from the resorts do you know
why do you know why they stayed away
from the
resorts the resorts in Mexico are their
primary uh business I think the resort
industry is the biggest or one of the
biggest so Mexico as a government can't
really survive without
tourism do you wonder if the cartels are
working with the
government yeah yeah the government
wants the resorts to work so they don't
get attacked by the
cartels because they want that to work
it's very obvious that the cartels run
the government and because it's a story
that they broke their own unret rules
about attacking now can you point point
to a story in which a cartel attacked an
American corporation operating in
Mexico have you seen that does General
Electric have any uh operations in
Mexico and wait does General Electric
still own NBC or did they sell it give
me an update does General Electric own
NBC they sold
it I think they sold it right
yeah but but the point is that if
American companies want to be unmolested
in Mexico and of course they do want
that it probably requires having a deal
with the
cartels that they won't blackmail the
corporations instead they'll do their
bad business in other domains and
they'll just let them do
it Comcast own zbc now okay thanks
Comcast
so maybe everything is exactly what it
looks like if if things were exactly
what they look
like what how would you describe the
world what it looks like is the
elections have been rigged forever and
we're just finding out about it what it
looks like is that the news is
completely fake maybe always was um but
we're finding out it's just you know
Intel and Democrats blah blah blah what
we're finding out I think is that it's
not so much Democrat versus
Republican it's always getting rid of
the populists because the populists are
the ones who are going to stop the wars
and War seems to be the business of the
United States it's the primary economic
engine and it seems to be driving our
foreign policy
completely that's what it looks like so
uh what about climate change if it's
exactly what it looks like what is it
well what it looks like is a gigantic
you
know
op yeah I'm not sure I'd say it's an OP
because you could get there without any
coordination you could easily get to the
same place just by science being corrupt
and people wanting to keep their jobs
and group think and all that you could
get to the same place but it looks like
science is completely corrupted and I
think climate change looks different
because we went through the Pand
mic what was the number one argument in
favor of climate change being just what
the scientist said tell me what was the
number one argument that climate change
was
true the number one argument that
climate change is a big big problem is
that scientists wouldn't lie to
you and and they couldn't have that many
scientists who were
wrong now we've proven beyond a shadow
of out scientists will lie to you
sometimes they'll almost all lie to
you they'll almost all lie to you and
that there's a reason for it and we saw
the mechanism in
play now I got to admit this was a blind
spot for me for a long time because I
couldn't understand why there wouldn't
be more whistleblowers in the normal
course of life like why aren there more
whistleblowers it must be true but you
saw with the pandemic that being
whistleblower just you know got you
crushed so yes there's there's a a Sy
systemic uh pressure against
whistleblowing that's more extreme than
maybe it's ever been I guess it's always
been extreme so if you just take what
you learned from the pandemic that yes
all the scientists can be wrong and even
know it and lie to you anyway like
that's like an easy thing to happen then
you look at climate change and you go h
oh
okay that was certainly explained a lot
so either so here are your two
hypothesis that you have to
compare number
one that uh scientists cannot be you
know corrupted by their economic benefit
well we've debunked
that yeah we've debunked that and but
then in order to believe that climate
change is still exactly what they said
knowing that the collective group of
them could all be Liars very easily I
mean just trivially easily they could
all be Liars we've seen it we don't have
to wonder if it's possible where that's
a question has been asked and answered
yes they could all be lying at the same
time now is that impossible to believe
that they'll all be lying no we all
believe that now didn't believe it
before the pandemic but we all believe
it
now um now we have to compare that to
the alternative
hypothesis the alternative
hypothesis is that scientists can
accurate accurately measure the
temperature of the Earth with
thermometers now there was a point when
you thought that sounded realistic
didn't
you I I swear it's the strongest
argument the strongest argument is look
at everything you've ever seen
everywhere in your entire life look at
every group activity everything the
public everything the governments tried
to do everything your big Corporation
tried to do just watch people just
people people being people and then tell
me that you
believe that we can accurately measure
the temperature of the planet to within
a tenth of a degree over
time you know that's not a
thing we all know that's not a thing but
it's easier to you know say it out loud
because now the experts have been so
thoroughly debunked the news is
obviously corrupt and science is not
really something you should trust these
days
so I don't know I I said in 2015 or 16 I
said that Trump would change more than
politics and it was my most underrated
prediction because here we are this is
all
Trump every bit of what you understand
about the world that maybe you didn't
understand before I know a lot of you
were there early but the things you were
suspecting were completely true and we
know that now so knowing that the news
is not
real just changes everything changes
everything knowing that
science can be completely fake and
easily and trivially
easily even if they're all on the same
team is really a
Mindbender that'll really open up your
head but I think we're there and I think
that uh the the two likely outcomes for
the election are that Trump wins and you
know by a large number and just becomes
president
because it would be T to stop him the
other possibility is that the
intelligence people uh working with
Democrats rig it so
obviously that it also Reveals All the
past rigging at the same
time I do believe the most likely
outcome is that they will try to
massively rig the
election the most likely outcome but
only if they see that it's within you
know close enough to to make a
difference so so we'll
see um I I think the uh the one
statement that sums up the last I don't
know five to seven years is everything
you
suspected probably
true I'm not going to go so far as the
moon landing is is fake and I don't
think the uh airplanes are putting
Chemtrails in the air to kill you or
anything I don't believe that there are
underground bunkers under all the
Walmarts or whatever it is people are
saying or is that what they're
saying so I don't believe the crazy
stuff but I but I think the the let's
say the political conspiracy theories
they all look true political conspiracy
theory you know the CIA is working with
the cartels probably true yeah the the
election was rig probably true
probably yeah Etc uh the reason for the
Ukraine war probably just War mongers
making money
probably I mean that the the war in
Ukraine feels to me like two gas
stations having a fist fight does
anybody feel
differently I feel like the only reason
we're in Ukraine is because our energy
business requires it you know it's a
competitive thing and I can't see it any
other way it's a fist fight between two
gas
stations and if you if you're willing to
send your son or daughter over there
you're you're crazy that would be crazy
but if the ukrainians want to do it
well I guess if they want
to all right
um glad you agree all right everybody on
the xplatform and Rumble and um YouTube
too thanks for joining and I will see
you tomorrow same place for more fun on
Monday
