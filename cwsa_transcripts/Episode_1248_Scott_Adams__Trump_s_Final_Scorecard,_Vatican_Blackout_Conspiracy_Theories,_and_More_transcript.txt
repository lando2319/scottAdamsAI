kicked you off the last screen but try
it again
all right hey everybody glad you could
join us
and if you would like this to be the
highlight of your day i think you know
what you need and all this is a copper
mug or glass a tanker chalice or steiner
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything good
it's called the simultaneous hip go
we do have a double white board yeah
you probably signed on today and you're
thinking to yourself
god i hope there's a white board
too double whiteboard wait till you see
it
it'll be the best thing of the day all
right
here's an interesting factoid to tie
things together
uh rob henderson who i follow on twitter
who's got lots of interesting
psychology you know thoughts
and he said around a
study that said that envy so the feeling
of envy
is above all a phenomenon of social
proximity
so the point being that envy is what you
feel about the people closest to you
your neighbors
so you feel a lot of envy to your next
door neighbor
maybe if they have more than you do but
you don't care so much about somebody
who's living on the other side of the
world because you don't have
exposure to them you only have envy for
the people close to you
but what happens if you're a species who
evolved
so youtube is back up if you're i think
it is anyway looks like it's working
so what happens if you're a species who
evolves
to have envy but luckily for you
it's limited to just the people around
you so you can
kind of handle it well i got a lot of
envy but at least it's just
sort of the people around me and then
you get the internet
now suddenly you have instagram and
social media and your ability to
experience envy goes worldwide
so you have this little problem which is
you're
envious of your neighbor now you're
envious of the whole freaking world or
at least the ones who are doing better
than you
and that seems to be every single person
who posts because they only post their
awesome day
here's my vacation here's my good thing
that happened etc
so i've got a feeling that one of the
ways that social media makes us all
mentally sick is that we were not
evolved
to handle that much envy we we have a
certain amount of
envy capacity and it's just blown right
through
and so i wonder if instead of regulating
social media with a
publisher 230 or regulating them
in terms of free speech or regulating
them in any way
maybe you should regulate them as
medical devices
see where i'm going with this because
i think it would be trivially easy to
show that
uh social media has an impact on mental
health
would you even have to do a study i
suppose it i suppose if you were
talking about uh having some kind of uh
medical uh regulation on them
then you'd have to do some study because
you want data on it but you wouldn't
have to wonder how it's gonna come out
right do you do you have any wonder
about
whether social media is affecting
people's social mental health
i mean not really right so
why don't we just regulate it as a
medical device i mean all of social
media
because look at the uh look at the
conspiracy theories the
the mental health problems that came out
of it i would argue even that the attack
on the capital
you could blame trump and we'll do that
later but
i would say that all of these things are
a mental health
either directly or at least adjacent
right because whatever is happening with
the
the let's say the most extreme
conspiracy theorists are you kind of
all the way into mental health problems
or is that just people with different
opinions
at what point does belief in something
that is obviously not true
go from well that's just somebody who's
less informed
to actual serious mental health issue
where's that line it's pretty blurry at
the moment isn't it
so if we wanted to most directly
and usefully regulate social media it
would be as some kind of a medical
device
i don't know what that would look like
in terms of regulation
but i could i could easily imagine for
example children not being allowed to
use it
or to use parts of it wouldn't it be
easy to imagine that children would not
be allowed to use
tick tock it's easy to believe
you know when i say children maybe
children under
12 or something like that there might be
some cut off
where you just don't want kids to have
access to it at all
you know they would be ruined for life
if they did
i think that would be reasonable so
the the all of the other kinds of
regulatory things don't really have a
chance at this point
but if we could produce enough evidence
that has a medical
element to it regulate it that way
um a lot of trolls have been coming at
me today
uh well actually i'll get to that next
that'll be the other side of the
whiteboard and
on the front side of the whiteboard i'm
having people
come at me today and say some version of
this
uh scott and dao now scott
now will you admit that you were wrong
all along about trump
now now you can admit
from day one scott
scott scott scott you were wrong about
trump and now is the time to admit it
they say to me to which i say
unlike my critics i can do a thing
called math
i could also compare things without
being
emotionally overwhelmed while doing it
watch me do it right now watch how i am
not
emotionally overwhelmed by simply
looking at the costs and the benefits
of a situation now a lot of people can't
do this
for example here would be my impression
of a trump hater trying to evaluate
the pluses and the minuses of president
trump
we'll start with the minuses because his
critics deal with those
most productively now i give you my
impression
of a trump critic speaking about the
capital riots which most people believe
trump had some role in directly or
indirectly encouraging
this is the critic talking about
president trump's
flaws oh what a flaw
whoa did you see that capital
[Laughter]
oh yeah look at it right there i'm not
imagining it now
i'm not imagining it now yeah
look at the flaw it's right on
television even republicans even
republicans are saying it's a flaw
so that's a trump critic talking about
the capital protests man are they happy
they're really happy now i'd like to
give you an impression
of that same protester
talking about the good things that
president trump did
um mr trump critic
what do you think of what trump did for
the economy
at least before the coronavirus well
find people oaks drinks bleach
no i'm just asking you just limit it to
the economy
let's say jobs how do you do on just
jobs orange man
orange man orange my bad
okay how about uh
you've heard that he's been nominated
for two nobel
peace prizes so how do you think he did
in the middle east
move the embassy probably gonna start a
war
isis
so you can't really even have a
conversation with anybody
on this topic you literally can't have
anything like a conversation so here's
here's the way i look at it for those of
you are going to ask me
do you still think it was a good idea to
support the president
to which i say all presidents are deeply
flawed
just in different ways do you think
jimmy carter was a winner
george bush junior
we have a lot of bad presidents uh
so here's how i do it i make a list of
the
the benefits you got from your president
and this would apply to any president
so i could be talking about uh bill
clinton here
if i were talking about bill clinton
he'd have a pretty big list of good
stuff he did
but he might have some you know negative
things too that's the way i would look
at any president
so do i regret
do i apologize for supporting trump
despite the fact that we all agree he
had a role
in a very bad incident this week in
which
at least five people died horrible
horrible but it doesn't make the other
stuff go away
you can be against his rhetoric and his
personality
and you know certainly you could be
totally against everything that happened
this week
but that doesn't mean that he didn't
appoint lots of judges defeat isis
become the first president to
take china seriously and push back he's
got he's got two nobel peace
prize recommendations he's you know he
did good work in north korea
all of that's real i didn't make any of
that up
right didn't make it up
so to my critics um when you asked me if
i feel bad that i supported the
president
i say why are you so bad at comparing
things
why don't why can't you do costs and
benefits and then i'll do that
impression of a
trump's trump critic and that won't go
well in that conversation i'm pretty
sure
all right um
i asked this question on social media
and was immediately
mercilessly mocked mercilessly i say
but i can take it and what i said was
that it's too soon to know if the trump
suspension on twitter will be viewed as
one of the biggest mistakes in american
history
but is certainly a candidate now
what happens when you say in public that
banning trump from twitter might be one
of the biggest mistakes in american
history
do all of my wise and
honest critics do they come in and say
you know you're right because this could
be
a landmark point in terms of freedom of
speech
now we'll talk about freedom of speech
in private companies versus the
government's
version of it in a moment but
do they say yeah you know you've got a
point if we were to lose
freedom of speech uh
you know that the effect wouldn't
immediately be obvious but
eventually it would destroy the republic
wouldn't you agree
wouldn't you agree that without freedom
of speech you're pretty much putting
yourself on a path
to dictatorship or destruction or
something
so to me it seemed like a pretty big
deal that
something that signals the end of
freedom of speech our most bedrock
necessary right that somehow that looks
like it's ending
and i had a historian come at me and say
scott you should stop talking in public
because you're embarrassing yourself
because there have been much bigger
problems you've got your civil war
you've got your you know everything
every kind of racism and war and
everything
and so people mentioned all of those
various other
problems to mock me for thinking that
trump
being kicked off of twitter is somehow
as big as the
civil war to which i say
would there would there have been a
civil war
if you didn't have freedom of speech
think about it would slaves be free
if there was no freedom of speech
would uh would abe lincoln ever been
elected
if they had no freedom of speech i would
contend
that basically everything good that's
ever happened is because we had freedom
of speech
and if you get rid of that which i
believe happened
literally i think i think freedom of
speech is actually
no hyperbole i'm not saying this to make
a political point
to be provocative and get some clicks
this is my honest belief
the freedom of speech just ended this
week
it ended for all practical purposes you
can still say things that nobody cares
about
right but if you say something that
really would move the needle
on social media you can't you can't
so historians who are the experts
believe that the loss of freedom of
speech no big deal
and they mocked me for my belief that it
might be
there's your experts believe the experts
has anybody ever told you that you
should trust the experts
because they don't know the difference
between somebody getting kicked off
twitter
and freedom of speech
here's something we're learning that is
deeply disturbing
that when pence and his family i guess i
don't know why the family was there but
they were in
i guess they were protected in a bunker
during the capital riots
and the incursion and they were hunkered
down in a bunker
while people within hearing distance
were chanting
hang pens can you imagine that
imagine the pence family really didn't
cause any trouble to anybody
right if there's anybody who does not
deserve
um to be criticized in my opinion i know
yours differ but i i'm no fan of mike
pence in terms of his politics
you know because i especially on the
lgbtq stuff
but you can't you can't take away from
the fact he's been a damn good vice
president
in terms of what vice presidents are
supposed to do
so here's this poor guy who's been
nothing but a
loyal patriot and public service has to
feel
the end of his uh vice presidential
career and maybe his political career
listening to people on his own side
until
until then chanting about hanging him
put yourself in that put yourself in
that position
it's scary enough that they're even
using these words
but imagine that you've done nothing but
serve the country
you've done nothing but serve the
country
and these are out there
telling you that they want to hang you
i've said again that the people involved
in that should be executed
i don't know if there's a legal way to
do that but i don't think i don't think
jail is good enough
i think execution is in order if you get
that far
i don't think there's a legal way to do
that i'm just saying in terms of how bad
it was
now uh
it seems to me that we've got a problem
here
with oh let me let me just tie one other
point together
so we all saw the video of the shooting
in which the
some kind of law enforcement person shot
a woman who is a protester who is coming
through a broken
window on a door now here's my revised
opinion on that
my first opinion was what
why are you shooting somebody who
doesn't seem to have a weapon
who is a woman who isn't really that
close to you
you know why why would you take that
shot
but now that i've heard this that there
were people chanting hang
pens does that does that change your
opinion
let me tell you if you put me on the
jury and you say this police officer was
here and here's the situation
suppose and i don't know that this is
true so i need a fact check on this
suppose the people who were there when
that shooting occurred
the people in the crowd suppose they
were chanting or any members of them
were chanting hang pens
now do you take the shot i would i would
take the shot
if if i heard a crowd chanting hang
pence i would shoot the first one
through the door
weapon or no weapon you know what else i
would do i would shoot the second person
through the door too
and then i would shoot the third person
the fourth person i would shoot every
person who came through the door
if the crowd is chanting hang pence
now if they weren't and that particular
guard had heard nothing of the sort
well then that's a different situation
but
if he even heard it if he heard it down
the hallway
if he heard it from even one person
if you put me on the jury boom innocent
you you get into the capital chanting
hang the vice president
and by the way the vice president didn't
do anything
he didn't do anything to deserve hanging
if you're in the capitol
chanting hang the president yeah you can
shoot the first person through the door
and that's not even a gray area to me
not even a little bit gray now i think
it's tragic
i don't think she deserved to be killed
i don't think what she was doing was
worthy of
you know lethal action but she was part
of a crowd
and if any one of them was inside the
building
saying hang pence you can shoot the
first one through the door
does anybody disagree with that because
i'm wondering
somebody says only if they are attacking
i don't think so
now i think that once you're inside the
building
that your threats have to be treated as
the actual event
somebody said did i see the video of it
yes
but what the video doesn't show is if
there was any chanting
prior to the shot so that's important if
it turns out there was no chanting
i have a different opinion of it no one
got through the door though it doesn't
matter you shoot the first one who's
trying
who shoots into a crowd nobody did he
shot the person coming through the door
um i just want to see
that's a pretty extremist position i
don't think it is
it's not extremist to say
that defense self-defense
within the capital needs to be fairly
extreme
uh no proof nor evidence presented of
what
what part do you believe the chanting
somebody says i saw videos and didn't
hear that on any of them
yeah that's why i need a fact check if
it turns out nobody was saying that
i do have a different opinion but think
about it
let me ask you this in retrospect
was the shooter right no matter what
people were chanting
in retrospect now when the shot was
first taken
it was in the fog of war when we heard
about it and it looked like
on video that it was a bunch of harmless
largely unarmed trump supporters
that was my first impression and i
thought that the way they got through
the
security was simply by having numbers i
didn't realize that there were some with
lead pipes who were actually
in one case killing a police officer
seriously injuring others
so it was way worse than you know it
looked on video
but suppose we know now that a number of
them
have said they had plans to do harm and
had weapons
there were guns that got into the
capital there were guns
base these twist ties and all that
now that you know that the some members
of the
uh of the group were armed
had intended danger even though it was
very small percentage
but you know they were there what's that
tell you about the shooting
again you put me on the jury
and i say that that guy used good
judgment
because he's the one who knew that that
crowd was dangerous
and he stopped it by shooting the first
person through the window
now tragedy we all wish that that hadn't
happened
but when we first heard the story
you were kind of thinking there were no
weapons there right
the guy who took the shot he was right
he was right if they had gotten through
that barrier
it would have been people with weapons
who got through the barrier
now that you know that that they had
weapons
what do you feel about the shooting put
me on the jury i get them off
completely i don't even have a slight
i don't even have a slight whiff of
doubt that that was a proper shooting
so i support completely the guy who took
the shot under the new information that
people were armed
he apparently took a big risk
personal as well as professional right
he took a really big risk
but he was right
right now you probably wouldn't advise
somebody in that situation to do what he
did
but you can't ignore the fact he was
right
right that counts being a hundred
percent
right has got to be a good defense
so uh absolutely that was an
appropriate shooting even though the
individual who got shot
was not the right person to shoot but i
don't think it mattered under the
situation it's a it's a mob
um
i saw at least one video of some
some uniformed law enforcement person
as they were letting in the letting in
the people in the side door
i don't know who opened the door but it
was clear that the uniformed police were
supportive of the protesters but i think
they also miscalculated
thinking it was a bunch of peaceful maga
people just like any mega rally
and they figure well they're not going
to be armed you know these are the ones
who don't
burn things in riot but they were wrong
they were wrong there were some people
in the group who absolutely were going
to do bad stuff
so that looks like a massive police
failure and it's good that the
leadership of the of the at least the
capitol police
resigned that was appropriate
um let's see
what else we got going on here a lot of
people telling me
that trump getting kicked off of social
media
is not a is not a blow to free speech
because free speech and let me explain
it to you
like they explain it to me scott oh
you're so dumb
don't you know the free speech is the
government
it's not about private industry private
industry can do anything they want
you know if it's legal but there they
don't have to guarantee your freedom
walmart doesn't have to guarantee your
freedom social media doesn't need to
guarantee your freedom there's nothing
in the constitution
that would require that scott scott
scott you
low information idiot
so that's what i've been listening to
for the last 48 hours
let me add a little to that argument
first of all
to my critics who explained to me that
freedom of speech
is a feature of government and not
private industry
let me respond to you this way
i knew that pretty much
most people were smart enough to be in
the conversation
they knew it too so why are you telling
me something
you know and i know and you should know
i know it
as an argument it's not an argument to
tell me something i already know
you need to add something to it here's
my argument
because i'm not pedantic and i live in
the real world and it goes like
this if you look at the arc of time from
let's say 1770s
to today lots has changed for example
the media has consolidated
back in 1776 freedom of speech
if your newspaper didn't want to print
it i suppose you could go to another
newspaper
or you could write it on a scroll or you
could yell it in the town hall
those are the only tools you had but at
least you had options
right as the media consolidated
coming towards 2022 it became
certainly your right to have free speech
but in a practical sense if you don't
have free speech
on the dominant speech platforms
you don't really have freedom of speech
what you have is a
legal right that you can't use
let me give you an example if you were
in a coma
do you have freedom of speech the answer
is
yeah you do you're in a coma but you
have freedom of speech
does it help you what are you going to
do with your freedom of speech when
you're in a coma
you don't have real freedom of speech
technically you do
but in all practical ways do you have
freedom of speech
when let's say you're in jail and you're
not allowed to talk to the outside world
and you're in
solitary confinement do you have freedom
of speech
well legally legally yeah
but in a practical sense do you
not really not in any practical sense
if you if the only way that people
communicate
in any effective way in other words
communicate with lots of people
if the only good way to do that is
social media and that's the way it's
evolved
and you can't use it do you have freedom
of speech
technically you do technically you do
but do you have it in a practical sense
no
not even close so here's the question
do the do the way we think of freedom of
speech or
the way we thought of it in 1776
is it the way we should still be
thinking of it or
and i'll just put this out here should
we take into consideration
a changing environment is that crazy
because my critics will say it's not in
the constitution
i know that i know that i know it's not
in the constitution
but thanks for telling me over and over
i'm telling you that we should
adjust so that our rights
are compatible with the reality on the
ground
and the reality on the ground is if you
get kicked off of social media
you're effectively closed out from
freedom of speech
and so we should consider whether we
want that to go
to be the situation or not now i've
heard the argument
scott scott's got if you don't like
these platforms
just go start your own go over to parlor
gab go over to rumble you've got options
just like these guys in fact you
probably have more options than they had
because of all the new social media
platforms but really really
let me tell you what that sounds like to
me
it sounds like if i tell you that the
local energy company that has a monopoly
in your town
if they decide to stop selling you
electricity
do you have options you do yeah
you could take a balloon and rub it on
your hair
and it would create static electricity
so why do you need the electricity from
the power company
when you could just rub a balloon on
your hair
that's the argument that my critics are
giving me about social media
scott you don't have to be on twitter
you could shout from your porch
you could go on parlor where nobody
hears you except the people who already
agree with you
so there's no point in talking to them
so do you really have options
technically yes and if you're really
really stupid you think that
those options
matter they don't they don't matter
if you're not on twitter you just don't
exist in our world or the other social
media
so if you think rubbing a balloon on
your hair is the same as having
electricity
then yeah going to parlor is just like
being on twitter
but it's a stupid argument
because in the real world
these are monopolies they're good ones i
love twitter
twitter is awesome but they're
monopolies for all practical purposes
again maybe not in a tactical sense but
in a practical sense there
should we update our school textbooks to
reflect the end of free speech that just
happened
don't you believe that we should not be
teaching
kids that we have freedom of speech in a
practical sense
because we don't as of today if your
kids are taught in school that they have
freedom of speech
that's not true they only have freedom
until some big company tells them they
don't
and then they don't and by the way do
you think that the social media
companies would have done what they did
without pressure from the government no
 way
this was the government suppressing your
free speech
you tell me that those social media
companies could all make their own
private independent decisions
yes they can do you think they did not a
 chance
not a chance the government
or members of it pressure the social
media companies and then the social
media companies cave and do what the
government wants
the government being democrats so when
you argument
you argue with me that the government is
not the one who is suppressing your
freedom of speech
it's twitter you're a idiot
that's not what's happening
it's the government pressuring the
companies and the companies
being compatible with or agreeing with
the government go along with it
not one of those companies was going to
ban twitter
because they wanted to right
well maybe i mean i don't want to be a
mind reader so i suppose
anything's possible but if you're
telling me that the government is not
pressuring the democrats in this case if
you tell me they're not pressuring the
social media companies to get rid of
trump well that's just stupid because
you can see it it's
right in front of you you they're
actually doing it in public
am i wrong that the government is in
public
calling for the social media companies
to ban freedom of speech for
a member of the public this is happening
right in front of you i'm not making
anything up you're watching it
everything i've said except the internal
intent part
is something you can just observe
on the plus side trump
derangement syndrome was cured
i don't know if you've noticed that but
tds
has actually been cured and here's why
for four years trump uh haters
were sure that he was the devil and
hitler
but every time he did something it
wasn't matching
their opinion so if your opinion doesn't
match your observation
it's like he's a racist wait he did
what with prison reform
who departed he's he hates the jewish
people
he did what with the embassy wait israel
is going to name a town after him
so we've had four years of the the worst
imaginations of who trump was being
completely opposite
of observation in order to square the
circle
they had to patch it up with hoaxes so
they would put in the fine people hoax
to to prove the thing that was
observably not true
so they you know they patch it up with a
hoax and that's what your cognitive
dissonance is
so cognitive dissonance which is trump
derangement syndrome
is when your observation and your belief
don't match
so you have to you have to connect them
with a hoax
or an illusion or a hallucination so
that's what it is
now what happens if you get to this last
part
last week of trump and finally
finally for the first time
that's my dog sleep barking if you hear
that hey stickers
i have to wake up my dog she's ruining
my whole periscope
okay so what happens when you finally
get a situation
where somebody who thinks trump is
dangerous can observe
how he acted about this capital protest
stuff and they could say
[Music]
[Laughter]
finally finally my opinion
and my observation
oh they finally fit
so good so good now
because they're also idiots they believe
that this one observation
cancels out all four years of his
accomplishments
so the belief from the the tds
recoverers because they are recovering
it's the first time their observation
matches their belief now they're
revising the last four years
to say well nailed it
nailed it yeah maybe trump
did accomplish more than any president
in the history of
presidents i think that's true for the
economy and for world peace and
for trade negotiations and prison reform
and all kinds of stuff but
well he sure screwed up that last week
that's for sure
so i think in a weird weird unexpected
way
and i mean this literally i think trump
derangement syndrome was
kind of cured accidentally now they
still have crazy thoughts about the past
but as long as it's cured at the moment
it will probably be cured going forward
there's a big story on social media
that is so delicious i was worried that
things would not be interesting after
trump left
but maybe we're just in a world of
things are more interesting
so apparently the lights went off in the
vatican and when i say apparently
i mean i don't believe anything i don't
know if the lights
really did go out in the vatican it's
being reported it's on social media but
i don't necessarily believe it happened
but let's say it did
it's being widely reported this has
caused
all manner of conspiracy theories and
they're all good ones
so the popular one seems based on one
obscure publication with zero
credibility
and it makes a claim that i'm telling
you now is not true all right
i think i can stay on social media if i
tell you in advance
that i'm talking about a claim and it's
not true
which is that the pope has been arrested
and charged with 80 counts of
pedophilia now not a chance in the world
that's true
not a chance in the world other people
are saying that
it's uh related to the other conspiracy
theory that italy
had something to do with our election
data
and you know something went through
italy and then the numbers changed and
it went back and so somehow italy is
involved with rigging the election and
and this is this is the response to that
nope
no nope
lights also went out in pakistan
somebody said they went out around the
eiffel tower i don't know if any of
those are true
certainly more likely coincidence now
some people are saying hey
maybe it's that solar winds hack and
some
some country is just testing their
ability to turn off the electricity in
different countries
i doubt you would test it doesn't seem
like testing it would be smart
uh because you should test it against
your actual enemy not
the vatican so that would be a weird way
to test that
because if you tested it and you could
see that it worked and people found it
out then they would be able to
harden their own systems against this so
it's not really the thing you should
test
you should just do it when you're ready
to start world war three
so i don't believe any of the conspiracy
theories i think just they had a grid
problem
is my guess and how would they get past
the
uh the guards the swiss guard
how how would any security force turn
off the lights
and get past the swiss guard without
without gunshots
none of it makes sense so don't believe
any of the vatican stories
but they're fun um i saw an interview
with uh remember that horned protester
the one who got into the capitol
he had the big viking horns and new
shirtless and stuff
well i saw an interview with him and uh
the reporter said
um you know why are you here you know
why are you protesting
and the guy with the viking horns looked
right at the reported
reporter and he said freedom
now the touching part about this story
is i don't even think he knew what the
word freedom means
but even so in his simple
uneducated way even he knew it was
important
before he even knew what the word meant
and so he was there
protesting for his freedom
and i just thought it was poignant so i
just pointed out
um all right let's see if i talk about
everything i was going to talk about
probably did
i believe it did all right poor guy
wants to be an actor yeah a lot of those
people are being rolled up
by the way uh if you ever do a public
illegal thing with the cameras rolling
you're gonna get caught i believe we
will catch a hundred percent of the
bad actors who were in the protest who
also had
no masks if they didn't have a mask
definitely getting caught let me tell
you something that antifa learned
that apparently the mega protesters did
not learn
those masks can come in handy
don't don't rule out the mask if you're
going to be going and doing something
illegal
in front of a thousand cameras
uh somebody's saying that the viking
horn guy is an actor
i think he's also an actor but he seems
to like protests
so here's a little away that many of you
don't know
there are people who just like going to
protests
and so there are people who go from you
know protest to protest it's almost like
a
vacation hobby i spoke to one you know
a few years ago i talked to somebody who
literally would say
hey there's protest happening i don't
think he even cared too much what it was
about
he was just all down for protests so he
just liked traveling and doing
being part of the protest and stuff like
that so i think there are people who
perhaps the viking horn guy just
likes the likes the ambiance
just likes the practice all right
civil disobedience means no masks well
you have a good point
if if it's really civil disobedience
where you're not
you're not doing a crime then no mask is
better yes
if you don't have a pandemic it's better
uh it's also being reported
coincidentally that the pope's
personal doctor died of coronavirus i
guess
yesterday or today so there's a lot
happening in the vatican
but i don't think uh
i don't think we have to uh worry about
it all right
that's all for now and uh i will talk to
you
tomorrow
okay youtube you will be happy to know
over on youtube that i finally got my
adapter so that i can charge my ipad
at the same time i've got my microphone
connected
so thanks to several of you who
suggested i get that adapter
um the five died of coven no no they
didn't
john brennan could be charged with
treason if there was an insurrection
you know i don't think i just don't
think the
deep state is going to get charged with
anything
why does your youtube get more time i'm
sort of training people that
periscope's going to go offline in a
month or two
a few months i guess so periscope will
not
be a product pretty soon so i'm
i'm slowly accustoming people to
maybe they should be on youtube but i
don't want to push it yet
so i just give them one more reason to
be here and they can choose for
themselves
uh oh poland is passing laws against big
tech
suppressing speech i don't know what
kind of law you can pass the problem is
any law you pass is just going to be a
problem
that's why i think we have to treat it
as a medical problem because at least
then you can have data and say
you know this hurts and this doesn't
maybe
uh bring in rumble when it goes live so
rumble doesn't have a
live option huh i don't think it does
uh and when you're dropped from youtube
then what well i'm on the
locals platform it's a subscription
platform
if i get dropped from twitter i would
probably lower my price
on locals right now it's seven dollars a
month for
content that you won't see anywhere else
i do a lot of micro lessons on
persuasion and and systems for your life
so if you like those things uh i think
the people who are paying seven dollars
a month
think they're getting wildly more value
than that
at least that's what they say um
let's see we regulate private companies
all the time
yeah but it's hard with opinion stuff
and freedom of speech and what's
appropriate not is
just too subjective
uh a bundle package would be good we're
looking into that
actually we might do some bundle
packages and locals will have
a live stream option i think at some
point it doesn't have it yet
but um if i had to guess where my fate
is
probably getting kicked off of the major
platforms and probably
only doing things on locals eventually
but i'll stay on the other platforms as
long as they'll keep me
by the way it is my intention to never
say anything
that would get me kicked off a platform
because i don't think i have to
i don't think there's any necessity to
say anything in a way that would get me
kicked off of any platform
and if i do that's on me isn't it
because if i don't intend it
well i guess it could be on somebody
else if they just decide to get rid of
me
all right uh what's a locals so
locals.com
is where a number of creators go if they
have content
that is maybe not quite appropriate for
the general public
so a lot of stuff that i do especially
the political stuff is
nuanced so in the general public
you can't say hey somebody did a good
job on this
but a bad job on this you just can't do
it
in the general public you just have to
take aside and say your guy did
everything right
the other guy or gal did everything
wrong and that's it
so if you want to see anything smart
you're gonna have to go somewhere that
the general public doesn't
doesn't exist all right
um yes patrick byrne and others have
said italy was involved
but i'm not looking to that i'm not
expecting that to
prove out could be wrong yeah i'll do
more robots read news i need to get back
to that
all right that's enough for now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
