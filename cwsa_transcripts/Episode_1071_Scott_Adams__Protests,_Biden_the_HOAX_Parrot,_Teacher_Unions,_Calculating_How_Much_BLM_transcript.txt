[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time it's time for a
coffee with scott adams the best part of
the day
possibly the best part of your week
until tomorrow
and it's going to be a burner oh yeah
it's going to be a good one
i don't know why yet but i just feel it
i feel like everything's going to start
going right after today
everything's looking up i hope you're
not worried about anything in the world
because
the world is going to be fine it always
is
but first we're going to have something
i like to call the simultaneous sip to
make things even better
and all you need to join in with the
simultaneous sip
is a copper mug or a glass attacker
challenger style canteen joker flask of
vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine head of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the grota virus the economy
racism you name it everything ufos too
that's correct go
speaking of ufos my prediction is
that we do not have in our possession
any ufo
material so i hope i'm wrong because
wouldn't it be cool if we did
but i'm going to say that all of our
looking for ufos
will produce nothing but mysteries about
what we saw in the air
there will not be any discovery now or
later
that we have in our possession alien
technology
as much as i would like that are you
watching the
limited coverage of the seattle slash
portland protest slash riots
there's something i noticed in the last
bunch of
videos now you'll only see these videos
for the most part i think you'll only
see them on the internet
so if you're on twitter you've probably
seen some coverage of the
police trying to roll up the protesters
and etc
fire is being set it doesn't look super
bad
you know a few fires yesterday of course
it'd be bad if it's your place it's on
fire
but relatively small numbers but here's
what i noticed
in all of the footage i saw from
portland and seattle from last night's
action
i didn't see any black people
what happened to the black people it's a
black lives matter protest
allegedly at least all the video i saw
was just
the police beating up anti-fun white
people
did did the black people say all right
we're done now or are they at a
different protest
or are they not going to the ones that
turn into riots
because it's the anti-fog people who
start the riots
is that why i mean what's going on here
exactly
but i i don't know what these protest
slash riots are in seattle and
portland if they don't include black
people
because i thought black lives matter was
sort of the point
anyway it could be just the selective
videos that i saw so i won't make too
much of that
what about kanye kanye said one of the
reasons he was
wants to run for president is so biden
will lose
that's kind of frank here's what i think
kanye could do
i don't think he will do but what he
could do
imagine if you will kanye just runs for
president
in the normal way even if it says a
write-in
what happens well he just splits the
vote and
predictably it would allow trump to be
elected
but is that what he wants because all
that would do is change who wins
without any leverage on who won in other
words it wouldn't
it wouldn't really give any power to
black people who wanted to get anything
done
here's what kanye could do if he wanted
to run the whole country
without without the bother of being
president
because being president is kind of a
pain and i think kanye would be wasted
in a job
that's mostly meetings do you want kanye
to be in a job
those meetings hey kanye you gotta go
cut a ribbon
you got to meet ahead of state for no
real reason except we do it once in a
while
it would be a complete waste of kanye's
talents i think but what he could do
is start an endorsement party a party of
people who simply say that they will
look to kanye for um
to sort out who would vote or
like kanye basically endorse one of the
candidates for president not just
this year but in future races
so you'd have a let's say a group of
maybe you could give five percent of the
public
i don't know if you could but let's say
kanye could get five
let's say 10 of the public to say i will
i will look to kanye for his endorsement
and you could imagine that his
endorsement would be based on who he
thought could do the best job
for not just the black community but for
people in need in general which would
end up being the same
because if you took care of people in
general the neediest
you end up being a far bigger impact on
those in most need
so kanye could be a king maker he just
has to not run for president
maybe maybe you could do that too but
you know
the real win would be for kanye to say
look
democrats what do you got republicans
what do you got
just tell me what you got tell me what
you're going to do
and i will just look at them and they'll
say okay this package looks better than
this package
i think you should vote for this guy
you're not you're not obviously not
bound to it it would just be an
endorsement but
given the closeness of our national
elections
and given that a five or ten percent
swing especially in the closed states is
all the difference between winning and
losing
a third-party endorsement party
would actually run the country and that
this is completely practical
completely all kanye would have to do is
say that's what he's doing
and he'd say look i'm going to be the
birthday party
and the birthday party is an endorsement
party
at the you know week before the election
i'll tell you who i think you should
vote for
so he said kanye is a russian stooge
somebody says you know that one of the
great things about kanye
and there are a lot of great things
about him is
that you don't have to wonder what his
motivation is
you don't really wonder what kanye's
motivation is do you
it seems like he's right out there he's
not doing it for money
obviously i don't think he's doing it
for his reputation
because look at the trouble it's causing
nobody would do this
just for their reputation um i don't
think he does it because he's bipolar
somebody's saying because he's insane no
i don't think he's doing it because he's
bipolar
and i would i think i would
um take kim kardashian's view of it
which i do which is the thing that makes
kanye kanye
is inseparable from whatever you know
the bipolar
thing is and i'm not sure that that's
you know diagnosed correctly
because there's just a lot of gray area
in that world
but that's who he is and he's being
completely transparent about it i do
think that it may
give him periods of
you know thinking he can do things that
other people can't do
but here's the thing what exactly is it
that kanye can't do
if you had let's say you had a mental
condition
that made you think you could fly
but then you flapped your arms and you
flew are you still crazy
right because that's kanye's life here
at kanye
you know little little kid kanye what
are you going to be when you grow up
oh i think i'll be a famous famous uh
hip-hop musical artist and a fashion
designer
and what would you say to 12-year-old
kanye you would have said
um maybe we should have somebody look at
that because
that sounds a little bipolar to me
because you know you don't grow up to be
you know a superstar in two different
fields
and then kanye became a superstar in two
different fields
at least you know probably more if you
added it up
so is it bipolar
if you can do it right
because part of the bipolar thing is
that you you get kind of full of
yourself and
you know you think that everything's
easier and possible
and then you go through phases where it
may be less so but if somebody goes
through a phase where they think the
impossible is possible
and then they go do it are they crazy
i know feels like maybe that's just
somebody who can see the future
it's sort of sort of weird all right
um the coalition of 10 teachers unions
and the democratic socialists of america
just put down a list of demands
according to a tweet i saw
so here are some of the things that the
teachers unions are demanding
they want to ban new charter schools
and ban private school choice
now what kind of union gets a say over
its competition
in what world do we want a union
to get to decide what their competition
does
these are just different businesses what
does the
public school union have to do with a
new charter school
or a new private school why did they get
any say about that
how is that any of their business that's
just their competition
the fact that they even have the the
balls
to put out a statement about what the
american public can do with its own
money
you know meaning that if we wanted to be
funding some of these private options
uh i don't think that's the business of
a union what people do when they're not
doing something with your business
so that's way over the line and of
course they want more money
everybody wants more money and police
free schools
do you know how you can have a
police-free school
i would recommend a charter school or a
private school
because public schools probably you're
not going to get there
so i would say again that until we get
to the point where we understand that
the
teachers unions are the source of all
systemic racism now when i say the
source
i don't mean the cause because yeah i
would agree that the cause is this
legacy of slavery and all the ripple
effect
but as i've said before the school
system is the equalizer
if you get the school system right
meaning that everybody's got a fair shot
at a good education
then you've at least you've at least
said here's a path
with the very least amount of racism
that that you could experience
you just have to succeed and then racism
will still exist
you can't get rid of the way people
think we're just tuned that way
but you can make it a non-issue in your
life and i like to use oprah as by
example
i doubt oprah has a lot of racism
problems in her daily life
and if she does she probably cries
herself to sleep in a big bag of money
and it doesn't hurt so much
so you can't make all your problems go
away but you can make them hurt less
so i was wondering if we should select
our presidents not based on votes
but by some kind of scientific study of
how many hoaxes they believed
do you realize how many hoaxes our
politicians
act like they believe or do believe it's
hard to know because they could be lying
but at the moment uh biden is biden is
tweeting that uh president trump
ordered a slow down on testing for the
coronavirus
now the president did joke about that in
the context of
well if we weren't testing so much you
know you wouldn't find so much of it and
i wouldn't look so bad so
maybe i'll tell them to slow down now
that was obviously a joke
and when his all the people who do the
testing or involved it with it were
asked
they said no nobody asked us to slow
down testing that's ridiculous
but biden puts it out there like it's
real he still puts out the fine people
hoax like he's the last
person in the world who still thinks
that's true although a lot of democrats
still do
he's saying that president trump on the
coronavirus quote ignored the experts
from day one
that's literally the opposite of even
what his critics say
right because trump basically was right
down the middle with it with the experts
all the way the only time that i've
claimed
that he didn't follow the experts my
critics claim i'm wrong
and that he followed the experts that
time too which was closing china
so i'd said because the president said
the experts have advised against it
other people who seem to have better
information than i do
claim the opposite the experts were not
against it
so that would mean that the president
was actually compatible with the experts
from day one and still is right
because you do get to a point where it's
not a question of the experts
you know all being on one side it's more
like nobody can tell
is it better to open up the the
businesses should we test it
should you try it in some states or not
these these are not
science questions as much as art and
guessing
and having a system where you can adjust
if you guessed wrong which we have
we have a system of quickly monitoring
and adjusting
and it's working it's working
um so between the russia collusion hoax
the fine people host the
slowdown on testing hoax they ignored
the experts from day one hoax
biden basically doesn't believe a single
thing that actually happened
he's living in a completely artificially
constructed world
speaking of that there was a provocative
article
in human events i think by jane coleman
called the specter of systemic racism
and she compared it to
the salem witch trials meaning that
in in her opinion the salem witch trials
were a mass hysteria
very much like in her opinion the
systemic racism now her argument is that
systemic racism
can't be observed or
measured you just can't find any so that
it would be
a hoax just like finding a witch you
think you see it all the time
but when you actually dig down there's
there's no witch there
and there's no systemic racism i would
disagree with this point of view
and i would say this is i've evolved
to this current position which is that
whether systemic racism exists
or doesn't isn't entirely a function of
how you define it
so you can define it in the way it
exists or you could define it in a way
that doesn't
and the way it does exist for sure
is that the people who have money are
kind of locked in
and they they have a system which makes
it a little bit harder
for people at the bottom to get up to
the top
so if most of the people at the top
happen to be a certain race
let's call them white yeah there would
be some systemic
things that keep the people with the
money keeping the money
and the power and it wouldn't matter who
they were that just happens to be mostly
white people in the united states
but whoever is in power is going to have
a system that keeps them in power
right what's the point of having power
if you don't create a system that keeps
you there
so i think in that sense it does exist
now
if you define it that way you also have
to ask yourself if it should be fixed
because the way i defined it doesn't
necessarily scream out
that it needs to be fixed because
uh those those uh limitations
on black people you know rising up in
this
you know system that's a little bit
rigid um
is just as hard as a white person so for
a white person who has no special
advantages they're born into a poor
world
they have as many or more problems
different problems
let's just call them different problems
but they got problems too
so to imagine that it's a white versus a
black problem of course is just
looking at it in the least effective way
but so i would say that you can't say
systemic racism
exists or doesn't exist you just can
define it any way you want
basically but let's ask this question
um you know the entire stuff we're
up to right now is uh or what we're into
is the black lives matter protests and
so the question is do black lives matter
that's the question
everybody's being asked now of course
the answer is yes black lives matter
but let's let's dig down a little bit
let's say let's look at it with just a
little bit more
depth this question of black lives
matter
which we start with the we start with
the position
yes yes but
how should you answer the question and
i've been noodling on answering it this
way
because i you know i i role play in my
mind
what would happen if i were asked this
on camera it hasn't happened yet i don't
think i don't think anybody's asked me
while i'm being recorded
which is weird because you'd expect it
would happen by now
but here's an answer i'm noodling with
do black lives matter
yes absolutely followed by
far more than white lives
because um well let's let's dig down so
my claim is that black lives matter
and that at the moment they matter more
than white lives
now that's not a complaint that's not a
political position
i'm just going to be an economist i'm
just going to look at it
all right so we're going to break it
down and say on various levels
you know what is the economic value of
various people
do you think this will get me canceled
yet if i don't get cancelled for this
i'm
uncancelable so we're going deep this
time we're going all the way to the
bottom of the well are you ready
do you are you brave enough to go with
me come with me
here it comes how about an economic
calculation are black lives more
valuable
and again we'll get to a number of
dimensions so if you're only seeing a
part of this
make sure you see the rest of it
otherwise you'll see something out of
context
and you could get angered if you see it
out of context if you see it in context
it won't bother you that much
from an economic perspective is a black
life worth more than a white life
i would say yes unambiguously
so because economically and here are all
the reasons that a black life is worth
more than a white life on average this
is just not average we're not talking
about
every person compared to every other
person just on average
here's why let's say you're a fortune
500 company
you have two candidates one is a
qualified black candidate one is a
qualified white candidate both equally
qualified
who gets hired well the black candidate
will get hired
almost every time because they have two
benefits
they can do the job remember my
situation is that it's two candidates
equal
qualifications so they get a good
candidate can do the job
plus they have more diversity and
diversity does have an economic value
to the big corporations who are trying
to get more of it
so in an economic sense from let's say a
business which is putting a dollar value
on a candidate the black dna has a
higher dollar value
would everybody agree with that now this
does not apply
i don't think to small business i think
when you get down to small business
people are watching them as carefully
you know there's not as much pressure
on some company you've never heard of
then there is you know on apple computer
or something like that
so small companies i would say probably
more likely to discriminate
probably i've never seen any data on
that but doesn't that feel
feels likely so i would say that in the
small business world it might be
reversed a little bit
meaning that there may be enough racism
that
the black lives would matter a little
bit less in that marketplace
to various people who have their racist
and non-racist reasons
but i'd say big companies black lives
are valued
it unambiguously are valued higher than
other lives because they like diversity
how about in the media let's say there's
a
big media platform could be a news
platform could be an entertainment
platform
and they have two options one they could
have a hit
show with a white host or
white cast or they could have a hit show
with a black host and a black cast
which would they select given that both
of them give them the same
income so they're both hits
and they both make the same amount of
money which is worth more
to the platform i would say the black
content
because they get again a double benefit
they want more diversity
that may bring more black viewers to
their network which is good
so i would argue that in the arts
at the moment content by black artists
is worth more because society sort of
valued it that way
now again if you think that i'm putting
any value judgments on any of this
like it's my opinion it shouldn't be
you're not seeing anything like that
i'm just doing the math all i'm doing is
telling you values
and subject to opinion of course
how about um tax-wise
one way to know how much something is
worth is by looking at how the public
organizes its tax system for example
would you say that the tax system and
therefore the government
puts a high value on education you would
because there's a lot of money that gets
taxed and put into education so you'd
say that
that society values education
we put a lot of money into the defense
so society
values defense that's embarrassing i've
had chocolate all over my
along my arm
and you would say for example that
wherever money flows
that's where society has decided that
the money is better
suited here so there's more more bang
for the buck
and i would say that in that world the
black lives matter
more than white lives in the tax
situation because i and again you'd have
to fact check this
but i'll bet you would find that because
of the economic disparity
that money flows largely from uh on
average
white people to on average people of
color
and also from the asian community to
other communities as well
so the ones that are doing the best
economically are paying the most taxes
in dollar amount
you know you can have your argument
about percentages but in dollar amount
the ones who have the money are paying
the most
and that money is flowing away from them
to another group so this one's this
one's not as clear as that means that
one group is economically more valuable
but you can see that society has a very
distinct preference for transfer of
wealth
from white people to black people and
that that's our system as it exists
now there are lots of you know reasons
why that makes sense i'm not saying it
doesn't make sense
i'm not arguing against it i'm not
arguing against it
somebody says you're not embarrassed i
don't know what that means
in all caps you can't yell at me you're
not embarrassed
in all caps because you should be
embarrassed if you're
yelling at me in all caps i'm not even
sure if that was for me
all right how about socially our black
people
uh our black lives more valuable or less
valuable than white people
socially somebody says you're just
you're just spewing well
you do have a an option to disagree with
me with reasons
there's enough there's enough room in
your little comment there
your little text blocks to uh
to make a comment i see i'm making
everybody mad so i'm going to keep going
how about socially i would argue that
uh this is just an observation so i
wouldn't put any
any weight behind this but i'd be
interested in your opinion
in in my observation black people have
very much social ability to
to get into you know white social groups
at least where i live there would be no
no
no barrier to that whatsoever no
friction but does it work the same way
the other way if you were if you were
white could you easily break into an
all-black
social situation and feel comfortable
with that i know it would be hard
but i think it's quite easy it was just
my experience
my experience is that any black person
who wanted to break into any
white social group could do it
effortlessly
on top of that black people
are one of the rare groups that have
their own fetish category
in porn now again i'm not going to put a
value judgment on any of this
i'm just describing just describing
if you had an option of being your own
fetish category
meaning that you would know that some
portion of the public really really
wants to get with you
it's not the worst place to be there's
no
there's no fetish category for generic
white people
we don't we don't have that little extra
thing you know
to be a little extra exotic no i i get
that
people have their own preferences for
who they want to be with
but i would argue that you could make a
case again this would be a little
subjective
that uh black people do have some social
advantages
because they can kind of go everywhere
and
i've never seen any friction to it in my
whole life i've never
i've never seen anybody say i don't want
to be friends with somebody
because they're black or anything like
that i've just never even seen it once
so i would say that socially pretty good
or at least even
do our black lives uh valued more than
immigrant lives i would say
uh the system of the united states would
say yes
so the um the system of immigration
let's say that immigration continues
that
explicitly values black lives
in the united states the ones that are
already here you know the citizens
it explicitly values them higher
than undocumented immigrants that's what
our system does
now puts everybody who's an american
citizen at a higher status and greater
value
than anybody who doesn't have that
status yet again you could argue that
that's good or bad that's not my point
today
i'm just explaining it so black lives
matter certainly more than
immigrants in terms of our system not
the way we necessarily think about it
but the the system
how about um if the police kill a black
man
at a police stop versus a white man
which one has the most
value now here value is a weird
construct
but there are no protests about white
people being killed by police
now you could say well there's a good
reason for that scott
is there there are more white people
killed by police than black people
it's not even close so you could say
it's a question of percentages
and i i would hear that but i also say
it is a truth
that there's probably no amount of white
people that could ever be killed by
police that would cause a protest
right so i believe that there is
actually some special value
that's put on black lives and i'm not
saying that's right or wrong
i'm just saying that the amount of
energy that the
even the white public if you look at
antifa look at the character of the
protesters
at least in the northwest it looks like
it's more white than black
so i would say that that's a lot of
white people who have put more value
on black lives at least more value in
terms of what they're willing to fight
for
for whatever reason now again all of
these are complicated
if if if i made it look as if these are
clean decisions
that would be incorrect these are really
gray overlapping
sort of decisions but when you ask do
black lives matter i would say that from
the perspective of
white people the answer is unambiguously
yes
it's not just yes as hell yes it's hell
yes
economically socially police-wise
it's helios in every possible sense
from white people's perspective so
that's why the question
i think especially strikes us as
provocative in a bad way meaning who are
you trying to convince
were you trying to talk me into thinking
that black people have value
i didn't need to be talked into it i i
was there
you know there was no con no conversion
necessary
and i think was it hotep jesus who said
when i was talking to him on his podcast
i think it was
he who said that the black lives matter
is black people talking to themselves
have you have you ever thought of it
that way because
it is actually kind of perplexing why i
would need to be convinced of something
that i started out believing
and then his theory that it's black
people convincing themselves
that they matter i think well you know i
can't say that
because you know i don't think that
would be for me to say
but i'll put it out there so you can
decide if you want to
what you want to do with it all right um
i had this weird situation this morning
where i read something where i agreed
with cnn
and i thought i read it wrong i had to
read the sentence three times
to convince myself i had read it
correctly just because i had
accidentally
agreed with cnn here was the situation
so i guess some some school books are
going to use the standard
of capitalizing the b in black
and the associated press and new york
times have already said that they'll do
it
but here's the cnn uh statement
so cnn made the same decision except
they will also capitalize white
and i read that and i thought well that
can't be right
because new york times an associated
press if they're going to get away with
just capitalizing
to be in black you'd expect cnn to go
the same way wouldn't you
wouldn't you expect them to go the same
way and
i did and then it says cnn made the same
decision but will also capitalize white
and i was going to say hey but you
should also oh wait a minute
that's exactly what they should do
that's exactly what they should do
and here was the standard i was going to
suggest for myself
so i'm going to adopt i don't think i'll
be consistent with it because it's going
to take me a while to make this a reflex
but i plan to adopt capitalizing the b
in black whenever there's no reference
to anybody else
so if nobody else is referenced in the
sentence capitalize b
in black but if it's if you're also
talking about white people in the same
sentence
i would also capitalize the w in white
now would i need to capitalize the w in
white if i
only talked about white people and there
was nothing in whatever i was talking
about
about black i would say that's more
optional but i would never do a
situation where i'd capitalize the b
and not the w in the same document
um i wouldn't do that so i would agree
with cnn on capitalizing both
it just keeps it clean just keep it
clean but then you know
don't we already correct me if i'm wrong
don't we already capitalize
hispanic why don't i know the answer to
that
can somebody tell me the answer do we
already capitalize hispanic
and and really why don't i know that why
don't i know that
i can't even picture it in my mind as to
whether it's always capitalized
well you'll tell me um i told you the
other day about the story about the
sinclair local networks there's a whole
bunch of local tv news
networks their right leaving
company and they were going to run this
program
claiming among other things that dr
fauci was behind the coronavirus
and he gave it to china that gave it to
us and
of course that this is a highly debunked
uh thing and i guess the public outcry
was sufficient
that they decided to delay it now
when they delayed it that doesn't mean
they're not going to run it maybe
they'll run it with some extra context
or something that's not known but it's
interesting that a conservative leaning
entity was going to run a bunch of
content that would have been terrible
for trump
would have been terrible for trump i'm
seeing in the comments
people are saying that you would
capitalize caucasian
and latino or is it
latinx now is that preferred uh
indian and asian well indian would be
capitalized of course
asian would be capitalized because asia
is
i don't know it's kind of
you know any one of the one of the
commenters says
scott the adams anybody who uses
that
that dumb ass word is is
is blocked forever so goodbye to you
that's only being blocked for being
uncreative
all right um so there you have it
there's not much going on today
um in summary i would say this systemic
racism
is the
teachers unions the teachers unions are
overwhelmingly
white and they want less
choice in schooling and it is that less
choice in schooling that makes
really every bad thing that happens to
black people
now you can't fix bad education in
in a year you know it's sort of a
generational problem
but you could make a big difference in a
year or in a generation not a year
so i would say if we're going to pretend
that systemic racism is something we
care about and
and pretend that black lives are
something we care about you shouldn't
have to pretend about that
and you think that poor white lives are
something
that you care about it's all the same
problem it's just the teachers unions
get rid of the teachers unions you can
save the next generation
you don't you don't and complaining
about how many people got
killed by police while we don't want to
forget that problem
it's your smallest it is really hard not
to swear
do you know how hard it is to not swear
i mean i'm trying to do my best i
realize i'm
i realize i'm more uh you know
i don't get there all the time but uh
worrying about your smallest problem
which is the number of people killed by
the police is the smallest problem
there is no problem smaller than that in
the black community all bet
now if you happen to be the direct
victim of it or your family it's your
biggest problem
duh but in terms of the larger systemic
racism it's just
it's just the teachers union you fix
that one thing
and you're fine how how hard would it be
for kanye to fix
um this is a
this this will sound crazy but look how
easy it would be
how hard would it be for kanye to fix
systemic racism in one generation it
wouldn't be hard
he could actually do it right it might
be the only person who could i mean
think of another person who could it's
hard to come up with anybody
kanye could fix it just by
concentrating on working against the
school unions
now i don't think kanye usually is a guy
who likes to oppose something
i think he's more about a positive image
of things which is
why we love him he's more about make
things better and you know look at the
good side and
you know he's not so much about looking
backwards and and blaming other people
that's just not his deal
and we don't want it to be but he does
have the power
and if he could simply define
define systemic racism as whatever is
wrong with the education system
i think we could do the rest and if
kanye simply said
i'm going to endorse whoever has the
best plan for schools
there we go all right there we go aren't
you glad you waited for the end
here's what kanye could do to fix
more than anybody's ever fixed
he could just say i'm gonna endorse the
party that has the best plan for school
that's it just just the one thing
whichever party has the best plan for
educating the kids who are not otherwise
well served
that's it i'm going to give my full
endorsement full-throated
to that one thing because the other
stuff
it's trivial the one thing will just
change the entire nature of the united
states
make us more competitive competitive i
mean
your education system is drives your
economic system
that drives your defense and we're
talking about national defense
is completely degraded by having a poor
school system that's
educating people who don't have that
many options
so why isn't this idea going viral
it's a really good question and i think
it has to do with this
there are so many teachers in the world
this is just a guess by the way
and i'm gonna this will be an example of
how if your skill stack
includes more than one kind of field
that you studied
it's easier to have idea sex as james
eltashir has popularized that idea
but here's the idea in the um in the
field of coronavirus
and virology you have this herd immunity
issue and you can get to herd immunity
by maybe 60 of the people in the
population
having some immunity so you don't have
to have everybody immune you just have
to have a lot of them
and that's enough to stop a virus
likewise somebody asked why isn't the
idea going viral
of going after the teachers unions
because i didn't make that up right
in fact i'm i'm one of the latest people
to come to her probably
because the entire conservative movement
has been complaining about the teachers
unions
forever so here is my
guess my speculation about why it's so
obvious what the problem is the teachers
unions reducing
competition in school is so obvious and
yet
it's not a thing it's not the number one
thing we're talking about every day
here's why i believe that there are
enough people who
are teachers or have a teacher in their
family
that they don't want to rag on teachers
that's
it there's so many people connected to
in some meaningful way
a working teacher that they don't want
to
be pushing something that's bad for
teachers because the teachers
union is trying to protect the teachers
more than more than they're trying to do
other things
case in point my own sister who is
probably watching this right now
hi cindy uh she's probably watching it
right now and
she had asked me what i thought about uh
ragging on the teachers unions when my
own sister
is a recently retired teacher did you
hear the key words
recently retired and i told her
that until she retired i wasn't going to
say this stuff
that i wasn't going to complain about
teachers and teachers unions
until she was retired and she just
retired
so now i have a full uh
full uh freedom i guess to go after what
i think is the real problem
now think about my situation as vocal as
i am
about as many things as i'm vocal about
i don't hold back too much
on any topic i held back on that because
it was a personal situation in which i
didn't want to
you know degrade my own sister's
lifestyle
but now she's retired i'm free
right her pension's locked in so
i i think that that's it i think there's
a herd immunity
toward going after the teachers unions
just because so many of us
have some strong relationship with the
teacher
i think that's what it is exactly so we
have to somehow break that
now can you and i break that no
no i do not have the power or the
influence to get through that
herd immunity do you know who does
kanye right like for for me this is like
um you've you've probably watched me
push over a lot of bamboo walls
you know if you give me a soft structure
give me a little uh
you know drywall i can punch through
some drywall
but if i had a concrete wall i you know
that's the end of my power i could bang
on the concrete wall all day long
with my powers of persuasion but i don't
have that much horsepower
but kanye does kanye could blow right
through a concrete wall
kanye could like bulldoze a concrete
wall like it wasn't in there
because he has that level of persuasion
power
you know above my own so if he were to
identify the one single biggest problem
with uh structural systemic racism which
is the teachers unions
or simply just you know rather than go
against somebody it's better to say
i'm in favor of school choice you know
i'm going to help some people
develop some models of better schooling
or something like that
you know go go the positive direction
but if he were to uh just make a single
a single-issue endorsement criteria
he would determine the next president
and he would
end systemic racism in one generation
so there you go all right um somebody
says black lives matter equals no
charter schools
incorrect black lives matter do not mind
charter schools
you hear this clearly black lives matter
are not opposed to charter schools kind
of like them
now that everybody's different so i'm
not speaking for everybody in black
lives matter
but what i've been told by a member of
black lives matter
is that the black community kind of like
school choice
why wouldn't they it's obvious that they
should like it it's obvious
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
later
