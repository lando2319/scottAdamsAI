it's time it's time for coffee with
scott adams
best part of the day every single time
yeah every time and if you'd like to
enjoy this
why wouldn't you really uh all you need
is a copper mag or a glass a
tanker jealous or stein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
it's going to happen right now go
ah yeah that's good i see in your
comments
people asking me to comment about thomas
sowell uh did something happen today
because i didn't see any stories that
involved him so
lance i can't comment on him i don't
know what you're talking about
but i suppose if i find out i'll do it
tomorrow
um did you see the video of man versus
bobcat
in the real news that's totally real and
it never misleads you
there's a viral video of a man going out
to his car in the driveway
driveway and before he gets in his wife
comes out
it looks like she's carrying maybe a cat
carrier case with a cat in it or
something
and a bobcat
lunges at the wife who's between two of
the cars
like attaches to her back and and the
wife starts screaming
and i'm being attacked now
here's the good part the husband who's
on the other side of the car
no delay goes right at the bobcat
rips it off his wife holds it in the air
looks it down like is like staring it
down while he's holding it
and then takes it and he throws it
across the lawn
and it gets better then he pulls out his
gun
because apparently he was strapped and
he starts chasing the bobcat
who comes back to attack his wife and
like under the car and you know
now he's armed he's like i'm gonna shoot
that thing
well everybody lived and that was the
story
bobcat attacks man man beats bobcat
pretty good right just before i came on
somebody said in the comments that's not
a bobcat
that's a cat
and i looked at it again and the the
bobcat
is basically the same size as my last
cat
like really big feel like a maine
cat kind of thing barely big
but not a bobcat now let me tell you
what you can do with a cat
sometimes that you really can't ever do
with a bobcat
and i'll demonstrate imagine that you're
holding this cat
and or bobcat like this and you're
holding it in front of you
for up to five seconds
you could do that with a regular cat
and maybe not be killed i'm not positive
that you can hold up a wild bobcat in
your hands and stare it down for five
seconds
and then reach it back and throw it
without losing every part of your face
i'm not sure this story is what you call
real news
but let me give a shout out to
men now no i'm not going to suggest that
you'd have to be you know the male
gender
to rip a bobcat or a house cat
off of somebody and save another person
didn't require that much strength
but i will simply note
that we should appreciate that men run
toward
danger men run
toward danger and we would have a pretty
bad world if that were not the case
and watching it happen in real time with
no delay
there was no delay it was instant boom
this man went right to the danger and
ripped it out by the core
and even had the even had a gun to
finish it off
that's a man that
is the purest expression
of the male gender now without getting
into the non-binary
stuff which is a separate topic but
somehow that was just
i don't know i like that story even if
it turned out it was a house cat
i remind you that the dilbert nft is
available you can see it
pinned to my twitter and it's the
first and probably only dilbert comic
that will ever have the f word in it
so it's one of a kind and uh i think the
bidding's up to 7 500 for the naughty
one
and the the unnaughty one the the
alternative
is up to 350 and so it seems that the
public is voting
for profanity for profanity
no surprise but if you'd like to get in
on that the bidding's going to be open
for a few more weeks
uh rasmussen uh
has uh an interesting poll
he said there were a number of questions
but one of them was generally speaking
are most deaths the fault of police or
the suspect now we're talking about
police encounters in which the suspect
ends up dead
so generally speaking are most deaths
the fault of the police or the suspect
how do you think this broke down
conservative versus liberal
conservative says two-thirds of the time
um it's the suspect
so conservatives believe you know by two
to one it's usually the suspect's fault
that they got shot liberals 22 percent
so liberals believe that it's the police
fault
uh whereas uh conservatives believe
it is the at least in part or even a
large part
the suspect's fault which of those is
accurate
in the comments which is more accurate
is it
usually and again we're not talking
about specific cases
but just sort of in general is it
usually the suspect brings it on
themselves or the police are just not
doing their job the way we want them to
what do you think well this is again
a critical difference and i'll be
talking about this a little bit
um later today meaning on this live
stream
of a world view and i would like to make
this distinction
which will be one of the most important
things you could ever understand
there is a difference between what is
true
and what is useful and if you are locked
into the belief
that the only things are useful are also
true you have handicapped your ability
to succeed
because there are lots of useful things
that may not be so
true and what i mean is if your
worldview
is obsessed with what's true
you're not going to succeed if your
worldview is that i'd like to know
what's true for sure
but i'm not going to be limited by it
i'm going to do what's effective
then you have more tools you can follow
what's true
if that's your best path or you could
follow a philosophy that's not based on
truth let me give you an example of a
philosophy that's not based on truth
you can control your life
that's not true it's not true because
there are all these other forces
that are banging on you all the time
right so is it
true that you can control your life
absolutely not just tons of stuff
outside of your control
but if you decide that that's your world
view
which is not true but you act like it's
true
and you build a philosophy and systems
around it being true
what happens you succeed
pretty much every time it's almost a
guarantee
yeah there are no guarantees in this
life
but it's as close as you could get to a
system that's going to work every time
that you just pretend and a lot of it is
pretend
that you have control over everything
right down to a police stop is it true
that the suspect can always control the
police action
by how they act nope that's not true
definitely not true but it's kind of
true
right it's not technically true because
the police can just be mistaken
they could be jerks they could be racist
they could be poorly trained
all kinds of things you can't control
directly but it's still
true you have a lot of control
all right so you see the difference if
you're if you're stuck in the what's
true world
you don't have as many options if you
say i love what's true
if it's useful but i'm going to use what
works
if there's a difference then you say i
control myself
and i can control you by what i do
not totally true but if you act like
it's true
you're going to do well let me give you
another one
there's there's lots of evidence
scientific and anecdotal
that people who are confident can
perform better
right so if you were a reality-based
person and you were obsessed with what's
true you'd say
there's no evidence that i could be good
at this thing whatever the thing is
no evidence every time i've tried it
i've got this result why should i assume
without any evidence that i would be
able to be
better at this the facts are limiting me
so don't use them the facts are the
wrong tool
in this case instead say that you are
you're great and you can perform well
and you can improve
is it true it might be true by accident
but if you don't assume it you're not
going to perform
at your best so having a false
impression of reality which is that you
maybe you're a little better than
any facts suggest improves your
performance
so if every time you're stuck in what
are the facts
you've limited your toolbox facts are
great we prefer them
but they're very limiting if if your if
your worldview depends on them
you can talk about that with some more
examples in a bit but let's do some
other things
first of all some compliments
oh i'm sorry uh also the rasmussen poll
um i think this is some other poll said
that liberals believe that over a
thousand black men
are killed by police per year do you
know what the real number is
so liberals this i think this was not
rasmussen
uh liberals believe that over a thousand
black citizens are killed by police
presumably without a good reason
what's the real number
about 27. now what do you think about 27
people being killed
black people being killed by the police
each year
if you're a human and you have any
empathy or caring about
the country you live in you say to
yourself 27 people got killed by the
police
that's way too many that's like that's
like a gigantic number of people
killed by the police who didn't need to
be killed by the police
27 is a lot if you're talking about
the government killing people if you're
talking about a disease killing only 27
people per year you wouldn't even care
i mean you'd care if it was your family
but you wouldn't see it as a national
problem
but if the government the police
are killing 27 people a year that didn't
need to be killed
if that were true you know that's a
separate question
but if it's true this is a big problem
and i would i would acknowledge that
black lives matter has
you know good argument about why the
hell you know
what the hell is going on but believing
that it's a thousand
completely changes your scale of it
right
27 is way too much got to do something
about that
you got to understand it better at least
but you look at what the fake news has
done
they have literally literally
right this is not hyperbole the fake
news has brainwashed
again no hyperbole in use here this is
actual
just straight definition of brainwashing
to make people 22 percent of or a lot of
liberals believes that over a thousand
black men were killed so obviously they
have a completely distorted view of
how big it is again 27
is a terror and can't be tolerated
compliments to representative chip roy
republican for introducing legislation
thursday
that would label the drug cartels as
foreign terror organizations under
federal law
which i assume gives us tools to
directly engage them where they are
i don't know if that's the case but i'm
pretty sure it gives us some extra
aggressive tools do you remember who was
the first person you heard say
why are the cartels not designated as
terrorists when they obviously are
who is the first person you heard
not the first person who said it
probably but who's the person first
person
you heard say that they should be
designated as terrorist organizations
probably me for most of you i've been
saying this for a while
and one of the things that i track
is how often i'm persuading on some
point in public
and then how often things go my way now
again i'm not saying i'm the first
person who said it i wasn't
you know i'm sure it was a fairly
popular idea somewhere
but there is a
a weird coincidence isn't there that
with that whenever i'm behind
something specific you wait a few months
and it seems to happen
now i'm not saying i'm causing it
because i think what's happening is i'm
just good at
like front-running stuff or just
guessing what's going to happen anyway
it feels like that's what's happening i
don't feel like i'm certainly i don't
feel like i had any
causation in this one specifically but
it's weird how often things go my way
isn't it
have you noticed it or is this just
something happening in my head
has anybody else noticed how often
things go my way
am i just crazy or have you noticed it
too
in the comments let me know i'm
genuinely curious about this
if it's a internal phenomenon
in which i'm i'm the only one who sees
it
or do you see it too again seeing it as
a coincidence i'm not saying i'm causing
this stuff
yeah so all right i'm looking at your
opinions
um in today's
bad data analysis segment i like to look
at things where people are just looking
at the
the analysis wrong so here i'm not going
to make a political point
and see if you can separate this right
i'm only going to be talking about the
analysis
so so don't retreat to your opinions
we're only looking at the analysis okay
the topic is masks
and mask effectiveness okay it's too
late you just went to your corners
come on back come on back it's not about
whether they work or they don't
it's only whether this analysis tells us
anything or doesn't all right
so kyle becker who's a real good
follower on twitter by the way
uh so if you want to google him kyle
becker
uh as a very good twitter
um follow but he's tweeting some
statistics
today that i question and i'm going to
ask for your help
the reason i question them is that with
my little bit of
you know data analysis experience
it doesn't look like good data it
doesn't even look like a good approach
it doesn't look like anything but i will
acknowledge that to
someone who may not be a data analyst it
looks really compelling
and here's what the graph tells you
there's no correlation between mask
use and number of people who die per
thousand
does that show you for sure that masks
don't work
no correlation wherever you add masks
you might have a lot of deaths some
places you have lots of basks
not a lot of deaths so no correlation
right
no i don't think so i think that these
graphs
literally tell you nothing about masks
actually
literally nothing there's no information
about masks
it's a graph only about masks
but there's no useful data about masks
in the graph that's what i see i don't
see anything about
effectiveness of mass i just see where
they're used
and here's the disconnect i think and
this is where i need a i need an assist
on this right
there are two places i can imagine you
would expect to see more masks
one place would be wherever infections
are high
so if you look at a graph that says
wherever infections are high
there's more masking that would make
sense right
that doesn't tell you masks are
effective it tells you that the experts
say to wear them
so wherever wherever infections are high
follow follow this part don't you expect
to see lots of masks
because the infections are high so hey
everybody mask up
so that part we understand whether or
not masks work are you with me so far
that would have nothing to do with
whether they really work
but we all acknowledge that the experts
recommend them whenever the infections
are high
so so far without any information about
mask
effectiveness just knowing that experts
recommend
it we would expect to see exactly what's
on the graph oh
infections were high so there were a lot
of mask wearing there because it was
recommended
where is a second place where you would
see a lot of masks
wherever it is politically recommended
in other words if you don't have a lot
of
infections but you're a democratic area
you're still going to wear masks so what
are the two places you would expect
to see masks politically
all right you would expect to see them
when infections are high
because the experts say to wear them and
there'd be mandates
and the second place you'd expect to see
them is where infections are low
but they're democrats and so they they
have a preference for masking up
so if you see a graph that says that
they wear masks where infections are
high and they also wear masks where
infections are low
what have you learned about mask
effectiveness
nothing nothing there's no data there
literally nothing about mask
effectiveness the only thing you learned
is
where they wear them that's it
does anybody get that now if there's a
correlation
or a lack of correlation is the argument
there's no correlation
and if mass worked you would see it
clearly
not these graphs no you would not see
that i don't think
so here's so let me uh let me put a
little more humility on my opinion
than maybe came across one of the things
i'm often criticized for
rightly is acting more confident than
my argument should suggest i'm about
75 confident that i'm right about this
that these graphs mean literally nothing
but they look like they mean everything
so i'll ask the skeptics to
dig into that all right
so i don't know if you're following the
law of self-defense blog
which talks about the the chauvin case
and i've recommended it
but uh it turned on me today
so the law of self-defense blog tweeted
uh
uh there was a reference to china and
genocide
and uh they decided to put me into the
story
and so the law of self-defense blog or
law of self-defense
twitter said i remember scott adams
saying
referring to this process meaning the
genocide against the weakers
as if china were dealing with an
infectious disease
and that's all it says why am i in this
story
what is the implication here is the
implication that i'm
in favor of china dealing with the
uyghurs like an infectious disease
feels like it feels like that's the
implication doesn't it
and if not why am i in the story at all
what would be the point of putting my
name in a story about genocide
now i don't think i have to tell you i'm
opposed to genocide
do i and it is true that i made this
analogy
that china is looking at it like it's a
like it's just a disease that they're
eradicating
does that say anything about my opinion
other than my opinion about china it's
not really
my opinion i'm describing china's
opinion
so why am i in this tweet
what's up with that and if you read this
without knowing the context
would you not think that i was a
horrible person who believed that the
uyghurs should be treated like a disease
kind of kind of suggests i think that
doesn't it
doesn't say it but kind of suggests that
interesting well in the most important
news of the day for the first time
scientists have created embryos that are
part human and part monkey
an embryo that's par human part monkey
and finally i know you were waiting for
flying cars
you'll have to wait a little bit longer
for that but it looks like the day of
monkey people is here
i would like to tell you the funniest
comment i saw in this story
from a user d hello dee
i know you're watching this and after
the
uh after i tweeted about the first time
uh we've we're creating half humans half
monkeys
d tweets there goes the price of bananas
congratulations d that was the funniest
thing i saw on twitter today
hell there goes the price of bananas and
what's funny about it is
uh that there are so many like deep
ethical questions and like you know
everything about the nature of reality
is in the story and
you know what is what is ethical and
what is not
and d says well there goes the price of
bananas
i ate a banana this morning because i
know i i got extra hungry for bananas
well apparently the reason for this is
they're trying to grow these monkey
people for
transplants so basically
create a monkey person and then
rip out their organs and put it in a in
a
fully human person to which i say
um yeah i think we got an ethical
problem here
because number one what exactly
what exactly makes me love
humans more than monkey people because i
think there's a
gross assumption in this that if a
a monkey person were created that i
would somehow
have less affection for the part monkey
per human person than i would for the
fully human person
and i don't think that's demonstrated i
know i like my dog more than a lot of
humans
i don't know that i wouldn't like a
monkey person
better than a regular person because a
monkey person would have a lot of
advantages
like suppose you're talking to a monkey
person and you know they've got
they've got their phone in one hand and
they've got a pen and another hand
and you say can you pass the salt well
can a regular person do that
not easily you'd have to put something
down but not a monkey person
you've got a tail so you'd be like pass
you the salt sure
there you go and their tail would come
up a little salt shaker
and you wouldn't even have to stop what
you're doing monkey people have lots of
advantages
if i had a choice of artificial
insemination
and i wanted to create a baby and
somebody gave me a menu he says well you
can have
a variety of babies by choosing the you
know the donors etc
but we'd like to offer this new option
for a monkey person
and i would say i don't want to have a
monkey baby and they'd say no
no it's not a monkey it's a monkey
person
part monkey per person
and i'd think about it and i'd say
there might be some advantages if you
raise a regular child
regular child you have to buy clothes
that's expensive
but would a monkey person need clothing
or would they just be furry and they
would always
be warm would they have an advantage in
sports
because you know you like your kid to be
the the star athlete
i believe a monkey person could excel at
sports
you know a little extra muscles per
weight
etc and you know forget about the tail
how good would you be at sports if you
had a tail
i feel like it would help
so let's not make any racist jokes i
know you're
dying to do that but we don't do that
here let's just uh
let's just celebrate the fact that we
could be creating monkey people
all right here's your propaganda alert
in the guardian british publication they
say
that apparently there's some data breach
and they found out that
there are some u.s police officers and
public officials who donated to kyle
rittenhouse's
i guess defense fund and that's a story
why is it why is that a story why is
that a story
should you care that police officers or
even ex-police officers and public
officials
donated to kyle rittenhouse's defense
what makes that a story because i'm
pretty sure if you're a police officer
you can donate to a gofundme
you can have an opinion and keep in mind
that the video of kyle rittenhouse shows
him not committing any crimes
or at least the ones i saw what if the
police
also saw a video of kyle rittenhouse not
committing any crimes
if you're a police officer and you want
to donate money to a cause
for somebody who's on video not creating
not causing any crimes why is that a
story
why can't you do that now some of you
would say scott scott scott
you don't know he wasn't committing any
crimes you know maybe the courts will
rule differently that's possible
you know because the law is sort of
opaque to uh
to non-lawyers and even to lawyers
sometimes so you don't know what's going
to happen
with kyle rittenhouse maybe there's some
crime he committed but i watched the
videos
i didn't see any crimes i saw horrible
tragedies
i wish had not happened but i didn't see
a crime
and so this is a non-story this is just
propaganda
the way it's the way it's presented to
you is with the assumption that
kyle rittenhouse had done something so
bad that no
proper police officer could back him
and that is not true
based on what we know later we could
find out that's true
but based on what we know now there's no
evidence of a crime that i've seen
and if these people saw the same thing i
saw yeah they can they can donate to
anything they want
and that's not even inconsistent with
their jobs
here's more propaganda twitter has
apparently banned project veritas
who as you know is breaking uh some
really shocking stories about cnn
in which they got a technical director
to admit
in very clear terms that they're engaged
in propaganda
they know they are they do it
intentionally and they're not even
trying to be
news now that's a big big story
twitter has banned project veritas who
i think is banned in enough other places
that this really does make a difference
and the reason for the ban is that
allegedly
uh their organization project
veritas had some kind of uh fake users
and so project veritas said what fake
users
we're not aware of any fake users tell
us what you're talking about
what did twitter do did twitter say oh
here's our here's our evidence here are
the fake ones
and here's how we know it tied to you
and therefore you violated
our rules and we kick you off do you
think they're going to do that
no because they don't have to they don't
need to make their case
they can simply say this is our service
we say you violated it you're gone
now how do you feel about being kicked
off of social media without
a specific reason that you can verify
it's sort of specific but not one you
can verify
now i told you let's put some context on
it i told
you that youtube had taken down one of
my videos
for saying that i had made a claim about
uh the election integrity
that was against the rules and then i
said
i'm not aware of that i'm not aware of
making any claim and i certainly didn't
do it intentionally
so if they don't tell me what i said i
either have to never talk about the
election again
you see how dangerous this is i only
have two choices
never talk about elections again so take
my voice off the field
or get banned completely and totally
because i make the same mistake again
because they never told me what the
first mistake was
how do you avoid it when you don't know
what it was
do you see that the social media
companies have created a model
in which they can ban anybody for any
reason without giving a reason
and that we know that project veritas
was you know uncovering cnn's
propaganda ways how do you feel when
somebody who just
uncovered another media entity's
plain and obvious propaganda in some
intentions how do you feel when another
platform
bans them for a reason that you can't
and and project veritas can't confirm
even
happen what if there are no such thing
as these
these fake accounts or they've been
attributed to the wrong place
that's a really big problem that's a
really big problem
now every case is different so you can't
really it's a little dangerous to
generalize from project veritas because
there might be something they did
the violated rule and this might be
totally appropriate
but i'm not arguing whether it's
appropriate or inappropriate
i'm saying that if we allow the standard
to be
we'll tell you when you're when you're
no longer welcome
but we don't need to give you a specific
reason if that becomes the standard we
accept
the country's lost that little
that little bit of accepting the
unacceptable
would be the end of the end of anything
because all critics would just disappear
you just couldn't be a critic you would
make a few comments the democrats would
say hey there's one
there's somebody who's hurting us making
some comments social media says well you
violated a rule which one
well we're not going to tell you oh you
violated a rule again
seriously which one we don't have to
tell you
three strikes any rounds now that now
that we know that the democrats
um use major media entities as
essentially
you know a subsidiary of the democratic
party
this is the end of free speech the
democrats
have literally captured enough of the
right assets
that they can eliminate your free speech
and you're watching it happen
right in front of you there's no doubt
there's no doubt what's happening
you can watch it right in front of you
plenty of evidence it's
all plain and yet it works anyway
because they have all the power
nobody there's not enough power to push
back so they they know they can just
take it as far as they want
so i have to think that there are some
conversations going on about
me at this point now i don't like to be
the paranoid who says you know
everybody's looking at me
or everything's about me it would be
easy to be that guy
but don't you think now that they
started with alex jones and they got the
president and
you know now they're going after project
veritas
don't you think that if you look at that
continuum
alex jones president trump project
veritas
where am i where am i in that continuum
i'm next right
i'm next now i've told told you that
i don't i don't like buying into the
slippery slope arguments
because it's lazy things either have a
reason to go in a direction or they have
something stopping them
so i like analyzing things that way
saying something is a slippery slope
is like just waving your hands on a
topic it doesn't say anything
things either have a reason to go or
they have a reason to stop and that's it
what's the reason to stop in this case
so given that i believe they will be
successful
banning project veritas they certainly
succeeded with trump they succeeded with
alex jones now i'm not defending
anything any of those people said
right that's their job it's their job to
defend their content that's not my job
but i'm kind of next or people like me
right
am i wrong about that i feel like i'm
next
and if that happens i feel like that's a
whole
other level because you know the the
strategy of starting with people that
even even their supporters now are prob
have a problem like no matter how much
you love alex jones
and no matter how many times he gets
proven right in the long run
which is scary by the way the number of
times alex jones ends up being right
way more than you think but at the same
time
he's a provocative character i'm sure
he's well he has
said things that you and i can't can't
agree on
so you get the easy ones first and then
if people are okay with that
it sets the stage to get the the ones
that are a little bit more of an
argument
you know so people like me are not
trying to lie to you
if they take me out that's too far
but what can you do about it yeah now
the slippery slope
is a dumb argument because it doesn't
give reasons
it's like an appeal to magic in my mind
things have things that stop them
they have friction they have things that
cause them
if you can't see the parts of the
machine calling it a slippery slope is
just the dumb way to look at an engine
basically um
let's let's talk about some others um
[Music]
so andrew sullivan who you know as one
of the few people
who can be trusted in this world i'll
add him to my
credible people list now i believe he
would
does he identify left or right that's
what's so awesome about him
i i have trouble remembering if andrew
sullivan
identifies left or right because i think
he's
i think he just looks at topics
individually which would make him very
unusual
um and i think he gets blow back from
both sides
so that's exactly why i like him but
he's talking about how
the mainstream media had concocted the
story about the police massively
you know shooting black people
and uh he this is his statement about he
says
fascinating insight he was referring to
a graph showing how many
liberals believe that there's a gigantic
problem of police shootings
whereas the data doesn't show that he
says fascinating insight into how the
msm concocted a massive hyperbolic lie
and succeeded in getting most people to
believe it
well i wouldn't say most people i would
say most people on the left to believe
it
but i'll go ahead then the falsehood
became the unquestioned premise for
future stories and lies
yeah so there's a whole industry built
on the
lie of how big the problem is now let me
say it again clearly
if the total national problem is 27
black people got killed
by some entity of our government meaning
the police
that's a huge problem it doesn't matter
that 27
is a small number and it's you know 300
million whatever
um so andrew sullivan's calling it now
as pure propaganda
all right so there's another one
um i would argue that police shooting
the wrong people
for the wrong reasons could literally be
the smallest problem in the country
i can't think of anything smaller
actually now obviously
if you're a victim of it's the biggest
problem for you but
if you were to simply make some
objective list about how many people
were killed or
influenced by whatever problem it would
be
pretty close to the bottom wouldn't it
you know it would be close to the top
improving schools but the mainstream
media protects the teachers unions
protects the democrats
and so you believe that the smallest
problem is the biggest problem and you
believe that the biggest problem is the
smallest problem
i'm not talking about you with the word
you
i mean the public you're all smarter
than that
all right here's some propaganda from
conservatives are you ready this one's
going to be a little harder for some of
you
because when i call out the
conservatives for fake news
a lot of you identify conservative and
the first thing you think is
really my team does that
yeah your team does that both sides left
and right
produce a lot of fake news all right
here's
in my opinion here's some more you saw
the story about
kristen clarke joe biden's nominee for
the department of justice's civil rights
division
now if you're a nominee for a civil
rights division
you better have a pretty good past
about civil rights
and about racial things but it turns out
that when she was in harvard
she wrote a letter for the harvard
crimson which is being held out
as very very racist and i was just
reading a story by david
harsanyi in national review in which the
headline
is there's absolutely no evidence that
kristen clarke's
racist letter was satire ah so here's
the question
so nobody is doubting that the letter
she wrote in 1994
nobody is doubting that it was really
racist
looking all right i'm going to add the
word looking hold that for now
nobody left or right no person who read
it
doubts that it's super super
racist looking okay
everybody agrees on that and so when i
heard that
i said i don't even need to see the
letter do i
because even the little hints about
what's in it sounded so
super racist i was like well
obviously if it were a joke
it would be obvious right and then i
read it
and it's really much better than you
think
and i'm going to back kristen clarke
and i'm going to call fake news on the
conservatives
who are doubting her explanation of what
it was
so her explanation is she she called it
satire
now when you hear this something satire
does your brain say
oh it's supposed to be funny right and
then you read the letter
and it's not funny at all
so is it satire it's not funny
you won't laugh even once so how can it
be satire
if it's not it doesn't even look like it
was trying to be funny
well here's how it's really good satire
it's so good that you can't tell it's
satire
in my opinion so here's here's the setup
the context was she was um she was
arguing against the
science in the bell curve so the book
the bell curve
makes some claims about iq which
lots of people see as racist now i'm not
going to argue
the details or the truth of the book the
the bell theorem right okay you can have
that argument on yourself
that's not part of this broadcast
but there are critics of it and in her
criticism
this is how she she worked against it
and i gotta say this is a plus and part
of the reason to say plus is
you can't tell she's kidding that's what
makes it so good
it's really good and what she does is
she goes through some
alternative theories of why black people
are scientifically
superior to white people and she lists
them
you know this this researcher says and
it is crazy stuff like
the melon the melanin in their skin and
some gland
you know some gland is superior and
therefore they have
better competitiveness or brains or
something
now as you're listening as you listen
looking through her examples
in which she's saying that black people
are clearly
biologically superior to white people
you're first of all if you're white your
brain's on fire right you're like oh my
god this doesn't look like
science ah even though
these points she's making are dressed up
as scientists and researchers
just on the surface you say to yourself
i don't think these things are true
and then she plays it she plays it like
she's completely serious
and just leaves it there it's kind of
brilliant
because she she created a structure
where you can talk yourself out of the
bell curve
without ever giving you a specific
argument against it
she simply created a context where if
you're going to buy
one person's idea of science that
happens to have a negative implication
for black people
she said if basically this is my
interpretation right she didn't say this
directly
my interpretation is she simply put it
out there and said this is your bell's
theorem
here are some other theories that are
bat crazy that have as much backing
now i don't know if they have as much
backing and i don't know the details
i don't know if you looked into it you
would find that they're all you know
equally credible or not
but putting them on the same page with
the same argument
was really good satire because you
couldn't tell
it was satire and that's what makes the
persuasion so strong
so she called the satire because i don't
think there's a word for it when it's
this good
right there's not like an extra word
that's super powerful
extra good persuasive satire that then
it turns into a jonathan swift
eat the babies kind of situation where
you weren't laughing at jonathan swift
by the way just
google jonathan jonathan swift if you
want to know what i'm talking about
it's a famous piece of satire so
number one i have the 20-year rule that
says if somebody did something bad
more than 20 years ago just let's just
forget it
right if it doesn't intrude on today
it's just something they did 20 years
ago
they're different people let it go if
you're conservative you're liberal just
let it go
we don't want to be held to a standard
to something we did 20 years ago
but that's not exactly what's happening
here is it
because the way she's talking about it
today
is either true in which case i would say
okay let it go especially it was just
satire
but what if it's a lie what if it was
serious and she's lying when she says
it's satire unfortunately
that takes her 20-year problem right to
today
so if she's lying about that and i say
she's not
you know i'm going to declare it
completely adequate clarification
if she's not lying i think her defense
was good
and i would say that we should accept
people's clarification
and she's not saying today that she
backs any of those wacky
batshit crazy theories but it was really
good satire
a plus and and here's the thing if i
didn't mention
she was writing for harvard right
she was in harvard so
if somebody does something that's
smarter than you
and they're also in harvard don't be
surprised
that shouldn't be a surprise so i think
this is case of bad reading
comprehension
uh but um again let me let me add some
uh somebody says somebody says in the
comments that you know
that i should mention that she's black
did it matter what part of the story is
influenced by
her ethnicity because had she been white
and written exactly that same letter
wouldn't you have the same reaction to
it
i feel like her ethnicity isn't actually
important to the story
but we've you know we conflate these
things and act like it is
um and i i don't believe i'm saying this
but
the new york times editorial board
also says it's satire so they agreed
with my interpretation
uh washington post's uh jennifer rubin
also
backed the the satire clarification
and i hate to say it i agree with both
of them
that is my interpretation so anyway
even if you think i'm wrong i think the
larger thing is
that if it's ambiguous and it was 20
years ago and somebody wishes to clarify
it away
i'm not too concerned if the
clarification is genuine
i'm more concerned that i and the person
in question
also don't want to deal with it like
we're on the same page that it doesn't
matter
that's fine with me we have new
pictures of ufos the newest one is a
triangle
it's a some kind of a flying triangle
and i looked at the video of the flying
triangle
and here's a weird coincidence that the
play button
on the video so you're looking at the
the screen
and you know here's the screen and
here's the video and then in the bottom
left
is exactly the same triangle that seems
to be flying through the sky
except that's the icon for the play
button
now that could be a coincidence
might be a coincidence and i'm sure it's
a coincidence i don't think the play
button is
is what the picture is of but if i ever
saw anything that looked
less like a flying aircraft it would be
the play button
flying through the sky it does not look
like an aircraft to me
i mean i don't know what it is but i'm
going to say
if you were to list all the things it
might be aircraft
would be the last on my list flying
triangle
i'm sorry i'm sorry i can't go with you
all the way to flying triangle
i'd love to all right i would like to
recommend a grand deal a grand deal to
remove systemic racism from schools
and there's one topic
that black americans and conservative
americans of all types
completely agree on which is the schools
need to get fixed
they're a source of uh holding down the
people who are already down
which i call systemic racism it happens
to
include lots of folks but certainly it
it limits the ability of the
different ethnic groups to rise to their
best level
so there's complete agreement you know
of course
individuals disagree but in terms of
groups quite a
lot of agreement now why couldn't black
leaders get together with conservatives
and say look we disagree on all this
other stuff but at least on this one
thing we're on the same page
gotta fix the schools and then the black
americans work with conservatives
together they would be unstoppable have
you seen black americans work with
conservatives before
yup prison reform
what was the outcome success
right when black americans work with
conservatives on issues that
at least they have some compatibility
they can get something done
and did the republicans lose any
elections because of prison reform
i heard a lot of people worrying about
it but i don't believe i've seen any
data that would say
trump got fewer votes for prison because
he did prison reform
now here's a very important point in my
opinion
one of the things that's holding back um
the black population
in this country is the same thing that's
holding back the palestinian people in
the middle east
and it's they've got a model that can't
work and it goes like this
in order to be a leader in let's say
black lives matter or
you know any black american leader in
order to be
credible as leader you have to be a
little bit more
radical than the average of the people
you're leading
right the people you're leading don't
want you to be middle of the road
that's not really leadership they want
you to be sort of an extended version of
what they're feeling that's leadership
trump did that you know a lot of
americans had feelings about immigration
he took it a little more extreme and
everybody said that's our leader
because he's being he's being even more
extreme than we are we'll take that
because even if he only gets half of
that you know that's the direction we
want to go
so to be a leader you need to be radical
but here's the problem that radicalness
is translated into some kind of hatred
for your opponents
you're not just radical about what you
want to do you're radical about
who you blame so if you're a black
american you're blaming white
supremacists and conservatives and
republicans
and then what happens when you want to
make a deal they've created a situation
and the palestinians have the same
situation
where if your leader made a deal
he would lose his job or his life
so if you can't be you if you can't lead
your own group
and simultaneously make um
make nice with the other side and
compromise
you can never get anything done
but it's the only way to be the leader
now um let me say that this
uh this point of view comes from a black
leader to me
all right so somebody who's a prominent
black american leader
name you've heard told me personally
that it would be impractical to be a
leader
in the black world and he was trying if
he didn't take a hard stand against
basically white people
that that his his people needed that
in order for him to be the leader now
what happens if you take this radical
stand against the very people that you
have to negotiate with
well you lose your job if you negotiate
so if your model is you can only be the
leader if you
um refuse to work with the group you
have to work with
you will never get anything done and i
just noted
that the republicans don't do that
even i would say for let's say the most
maybe a provocative
topic would be let's say immigration
reform
now conservatives have really strong
opinions on what immigration should look
like
and democrats have a very strong one
don't you think
that you could make a deal if everybody
were just being
business-like and politics didn't exist
but you had just different opinions
about how to handle things
don't you think you could make a deal
like we'll give you these things you
want but i don't like it
you give us these things i want and but
i know you don't like it but it's it's a
deal
i believe that the framing that
republicans bring to everything is that
you can always make a deal
and that if you make a deal you did not
fail
you succeeded but does that work if
you're a palestinian leader
if a palestinian leader made a deal i
don't even care what it is
but just made a deal with israel what
would happen
they'd be killed they'd be dead it
doesn't even matter if it's a good deal
it doesn't matter
because once you've demonized the other
side to that point you can't deal with
them
black american leaders have the same
problem if they were to make a deal that
made complete sense
in the sense that everybody gave
something up to get something
with republican leadership that black
leader would be kicked off the team
and if you create a situation like that
it can only fail
there's no other path it can only fail
and this is why i think it made perfect
sense
for trump to essentially try to get
peace in the middle east by ignoring the
palestinians
because they have a model that they
created themselves that you can't fix
from the outside
you can't so trump just said effectively
and his and his people effectively said
if we can't fix this
let's just work with the stuff we can
work with which was the other countries
and get a good result and that's what
happened um
i had criticized the trump
administration from beginning to end
about not doing more to help the black
population i do think they did quite a
bit
you know if you're objective about the
things trump did
i think it was very a very good
administration
for black americans income wise and luck
prison reform
funding of historically black colleges
um opportunity zones i mean a lot a lot
of good stuff
but i criticized him for not doing more
but i don't know you could have done
more because of this leadership problem
there's nobody to deal with
on a lot of topics but it did work on
prison reform so that's a good model
all right um here's a
tweet from uh a black american mom
that's that's her own twitter a
description of herself
is a black american mom and
or did she say i may be intuiting the
black part because the
the photo is a black person
but here's the tweet and it was in a
conversation about
whether the police are the cause of the
killings or the suspects
and he or she says
or just spitballing here the police
could stop
just stop being bastards it has never
been on me to make sure you don't murder
me
listen to that sentence it has never
been on me
to make sure you don't murder me
what do you think of that sentence
is it your responsibility to make sure
somebody doesn't murder you
or is it just that other person's
responsibility
here is a perfect example of what i call
the loser philosophy
which is to say a person whose world
view
is this that it's not on you
to make sure somebody doesn't murder you
you will never succeed in life
you cannot succeed with that point of
view
let me tell you the productive point of
view and this gets back to remember i
said
there's a difference between what is
true and what is
useful not always but there can be big
differences like this
so what is true from a legal perspective
if the only thing you're talking about
is the law the person who does the
murdering is the only one responsible
we don't have anything in the law that
says
well you had a really bad personality so
i guess he could murder you all right so
unless you're
engaged actively engaged in some really
bad or
violent or threatening behavior you
don't get to kill people
but my philosophy is i completely
control in the real world when you take
it out of the legal framework which we
all agree with
i don't think there's anybody who
disagrees with the legal framework
that the person who does the murdering
is the guilty one right
you never send the suspect you never
send like a wounded
person to jail because they're the
victim right no matter if they did
something
unpleasant that brought it on themselves
or not
because you got to blame the shooter but
that's just the legal world
we don't live in the legal world all the
time i mean it's always there but we
don't have to
it's not influencing every decision in
the real world
of just getting things done the right
philosophy
is that you control the cop
and if you don't believe that then it
won't happen
you have to believe you can control the
cop to have any hope of doing it
now that doesn't mean it'll work every
time doesn't mean you have complete
control
i'm not saying that i'm not even saying
that any of the shootings
were anything but the police you know
bad training or mistakes
it's just a general philosophy of life
that if you think other people are
making decisions and just influencing
you
it's a loser philosophy you nothing you
do will work
because you're seeing the world wrong
and let me put it in
um in more
clever terms all right there are two
kinds of mentalities in the world
one mentality i would describe as seeing
the world
as reciprocity and abundance
reciprocity and abundance as a worldview
now the way you see that work is um
i like telling this story about a young
sales person who is trying to sell salt
into grocery stores and salt is just
based on cost
so you can't really sell salt
it's just one is more expensive than the
other that's basically
it because it's still salt and what he
would do is go in and just help the
store owners he would just
volunteer his time go help him restock
the shelves
reorganize and stuff like that and then
he would get the sale
because he was the only sales person who
was giving something without asking
something in return
so the reciprocity engine i call it
is what drives largely conservative
republican
worldview it's about what can i do for
you
because if i can give you an amazing
service
i'm going to get rich right but it
starts with what can i do for you
with the understanding that if i do
enough for you
stuff comes back if you if you listen to
the
smartest people in silicon valley let me
use naval
ravicante as my you know prototypical
smartest person in silicon valley
his one of his uh tweet sized
tips for success goes like this
make something that people want
that's it make something that people
want
and you're successful now you might not
do it on the first try
you know it might take a lot of work to
get to that point where you're doing it
successfully
but that is a uh that is a reciprocity
slash
abundance worldview it's just compressed
into make something people want
if your worldview doesn't start this is
the important part
and so i'm not saying that it should
include
the idea that reciprocity matters no
that's wrong
i'm saying it starts there that's like
moment one
is what can i do for you if you don't
take that opinion
or world view you're you'll fail every
time we have a world that just
doesn't work the other ways now let's
compare that
reciprocity and abundance as one world
view
works every time and within that i would
say is deal making
because deal making is about reciprocity
and deal making says
we can make a deal where both of us get
more
you can't make a deal where somebody
thinks wait a minute i'm just
transferring stuff to you
get nothing that's not a deal so
reciprocity and abundance
are embedded in the idea that you can be
a deal maker
i would say that trump is really
a perfect example of this philosophy
trump was a deal maker which
indicates an understanding of
reciprocity first
and he is very much an abundance guy you
know we can all win
we can all get more if you just make
good deals
but here's the opposite of that
victimhood and
zero sum if the first thing
that that leads your world view is that
there are victims
and there are oppressors you'll end that
way
if that's how you start that's how
you're going to end
you're going to be living in an
oppressed world unsuccessfully
and to think that the life is a zero-sum
game
that if you have something and i can get
it from you
i have gained and you've lost that's a
zero sum
that's the opposite of abundance
abundance says
we can transfer things and we both come
out ahead
victimhood and zero sum says there's
only taking
it's a world of taking and if i can get
away with it i'll take it from you if
you can get away with it you'll take it
from me
now that's true right
it's true we live in a world where if
you don't lock your door
your stuff's gone we live in a world
that if you gave your
crypto key to somebody you lose all your
crypto pretty much every time
not every person but you're gonna lose
your stuff if you don't protect it
so it can be true that you live in the
world of victims
it can be in oppressors it can be true
that you live in a in many cases a
zero-sum situation
let's say you live in the year in the
inner city and the only things anybody
has is what they stole
i've got nice sneakers i stole them i
sold some drugs so i could get these so
although actually selling drugs is
closer to an abundance
mindset so i would say that
you can you can pick up people's mindset
by their language pretty clearly and if
somebody says it has never been on me
to make sure you don't murder me never
hire that person
never give that person a job the person
i want to give a job to is the one who
says
you know i got lots of ideas where i'm
going to make you rich
and i hope in return you give me big
bonuses
and then i say what did i just hear well
let me say it again
i have lots of ideas that i think can
make you a lot more money
and all i ask in return is that i'd be
well compensated
and i say i don't even need to hear any
more you're hired
right and so here's my take on
race relations and the entire
situation it's a strategy problem
that the mainstream media through their
propaganda
has sold to you as a victim problem
that comes from the media and then i
think also
through the school system but had you
not been brainwashed
to go from the productive worldview of
reciprocity
and abundance if you had not been
brainwashed away from that
into the victimhood mentality you
wouldn't be using it
because do you know where your opinions
come from
they're assigned to you they're assigned
to you
do you know where conservatives get
their opinions
well some of it comes from fox news i'm
sure
right some of it comes from breitbart
some of it comes from
from the media they consume but there's
another source that's pretty big
which is parents and church and you know
their their culture
and the conservatives come up through a
culture of uh reciprocity
and abundance and if black people in
america
simply understood and i don't want to
make it sound that
i mean that sounds insulting right so we
say
let me say if the framework if they
reframed their experience
from victimhood into
strategy they would take off
in one generation eighty percent of the
difference between the
ethnicities would just disappear and it
would be just that mindset that would do
it it would have to work through the
system for a while but
it would solve it all right um
so strategy like my book had failed
almost everything and still win big
that's a strategy book it's a strategy
for success
it's not a formula it's a strategy and
if
black americans knew that the good
strategy was reciprocity and abundance
how would they get along with
conservatives
all right a lot of conservatives
watching here uh
you are often blamed as being racists
right probably eighty percent of the
people watching this right now
are in a category who has been blamed as
being racist
but watch this uh black guy comes i'll
just say black guy
black guy comes into your business
you're the boss and that black guy
demonstrates an understanding of
reciprocity and abundance
you know through the interview process
it becomes obvious to you
that this person has no victimhood or
zero-sum thinking whatsoever
that everything they say is clearly
about abundance and reciprocity
who do you hire do you hire the white
guy
who doesn't have that or do you hire the
black candidate
who comes in and says look i'm all about
reciprocity and abundance let's make
this work it's not
even close it's not
even close sorry i didn't mean to to
to swear and if the black public could
understand just that
that one thing again i don't want to say
understand because that sounds
that sounds insulting i would say it's
it's a change in your frame
that has nothing to do with intelligence
or or capability it's just reframing it
it's all you need and i got to tell you
it is so frustrating
to see a situation in which the solution
is so obvious
except for the mainstream media's
propaganda
if you took away the propaganda and just
let people work it out
just say oh what's a good strategy does
anybody have a good
strategy that's worked yeah i do take a
look at this one
it's in this book and here's some other
books and bob can tell you about it
here's a strategy that works for
everybody
that's where we should be strategy all
right here i
in my ongoing series of defending the
hard to defend
now when i say hard to defend that means
that they they've got some real harsh
criticisms and they're the kind of
person
who you know one team isn't going to
like them so it's
it's hard to defend and this one you're
not going to like perhaps but i'm going
to defend
uh somewhat the
one of the creators of black lives
matter
who was accused of having multiple homes
while saying that she's a trained
marxist and people said
well you know essentially it's not
illegal to be successful and have homes
but we're wondering how you can be
consistent
how do you be a marxist while building
wealth
in a capitalist capitalist society and i
thought to myself
well this is good going to be hard for
her to answer right
pretty hard to answer how you can be a
marxist and being acquiring real estate
and money and i was wrong
completely wrong she actually has a
really good defense now when i say
really good
um i don't mean that she she sold me to
her side
i'm going to say that persuasion wise
and public
communication wise really good job
here was her answer that she's taking
care of a lot of family members
she has a brother who's got some i think
mental problems she said and she's got
other family members and maybe she's the
only one in the family who's
you know hit it hit it big and it looks
like these other homes probably have
something to do with taking care of the
family
now is that compatible with being a
marxist
she she makes money and she uses some
large percentage of it to take care of
her immediate family first
while also working on something that
would she would hope
make life better for the larger public
it's a little bit inconsistent
because you could say well she should
give her money to the public or
something i don't know
don't help her family first is that the
complaint
this isn't bad i actually thought there
would be just
sort of nothing she could say to to
soften this criticism
but i listened to it today in her own
words on video and i
i came away thinking that's not bad
in the comments matt says like everyone
right
if you see somebody who's making money
and distributing it
largely to their own family what's your
problem
is your problem that she says she's a
marxist i don't know
since i like the fact that people
succeed and take care of their family
i don't have a problem with this if if
in fact she's characterizing it
correctly
i mean maybe the taking care of the
family thing you could question
but i'm going to only talk about her
persuasion and communication
and in terms of persuasion and
communication
pretty darn good good enough that you
can understand how she could be
a founder of a a large movement that was
pretty good
all right now again to be clear i'm not
saying i agree with her
reasoning right i'm not i'm not saying
it's completely consistent
i'm just saying this was really good
persuasion and
and that at the core she started with
something that you and i agree with
which is take care of your family right
it's pretty good
it was as strong a defense as you could
offer under the circumstance
and so i will give her a compliment at
the same time i'm giving chip roy a
compliment
so um part of my strategy for
maintaining
uh any semblance of credibility with my
audience
is that i'd like you to observe me
giving a compliment on both sides
as well as criticism on both sides
and then maybe you'll maybe you'll have
some greater
belief in my credibility
uh somebody says her defense was
embracing conservatism
and capitalism i don't think anybody is
against taking care of a family their
own family
is there really a uh is
is there some kind of a political point
of view that says don't take care of
your family first
that's not a thing she started with the
thing everybody agrees with and then
built on it it was a good defense
it was a perfectly capable defense
somebody says hitler was persuasive too
i get it nobody's arguing that you have
to agree with everything she says
but it's skillful it is skillful
um she spreads her family all over the
country i believe she probably just had
family members who lived in different
places
i don't think we have any evidence
whether anybody had to move to a
different part of the country
but i would imagine that that's where
her family lives
yeah extended family
i see people talking about how many
millions it is we don't know how much
she owns
because if she has loans on any of that
property she might
own 20 of those properties and
just does alone
oh yeah look for the video that i
tweeted today that says that the
glitches in reality uh are obvious and
that's how you can tell we're computer
code
and the the glitches so-called glitches
you could argue whether they are
are based on quantum mechanics and
you know quantum science stuff it was
pretty good i've made the same argument
uh but he does a more thorough job than
i've ever done
all right um i've got i've got
everything i've said has been done and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
