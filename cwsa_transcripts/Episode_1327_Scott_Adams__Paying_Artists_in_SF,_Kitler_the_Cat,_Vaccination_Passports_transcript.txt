the thing that makes everything better
you know it does
come on you know it does it happens
right now it's called
the simultaneous sip join me now go
ah yeah
that's good so i'd like to give you a
little uh
flash from the past you ready for it
i was looking in my closet the other day
upstairs i was just looking for
something
and i found this
this gigantic uh emergency rice
and i want to
i want to take you back to where your
heads were
one year ago roughly one year ago
when the uh the lockdowns were just
beginning
and everybody was buying their uh their
their secret stores
not only did i buy secret stores of
foodstuffs but and by the way why do
they call it food stuffs
how about just food yeah but i actually
hit it
so that when the the roving band of uh
armed i'm sorry uh
so when the roving band of uh
of bandits came to rob my house and
killed me and steal my food they
wouldn't be able to find it
now do you remember how scared you were
a year ago
when all the toilet paper was gone it
looked like maybe the entire economy
of the world would you know plunge into
darkness
do you remember just how scary that was
i just think about it because you know
we're all we're all bitching about our
vaccinations right oh my arm's gonna
hurt
and you know maybe maybe it's not good
for me and
but compared to what it was a year ago
oh my god
i'm gonna tell you a story that would be
better if i could tell you the person
but just for privacy i won't
so when the pandemic began and i was
telling people you know don't worry too
much it won't be that bad
i got a call at home one day from
somebody who is really really good
at understanding the world and
predicting what's going to happen next
and i've never been so frightened in my
life
now when i say i've never been so
frightened in my life i mean that
literally
last year at a time when i was telling
all of you it'll be fine
you know just prepare do everything you
can but don't don't worry yourself to
death
you know we'll work through it etc and
by the way i was right
wouldn't you say wouldn't you largely
say
that my characterization that we would
get through it we wouldn't run out of
food
you know we wouldn't die it would just
be really really
inconvenient and you know bad
economically
for a lot of people but we would get
through it
but i'll tell you uh at the same time i
was hearing that
i was hearing from somebody whose
opinion i really respect
that we were doomed that we were
we were in big trouble and i was trying
not to tell you that
because i didn't buy it right so first
of all you know my optimism was
legitimate i thought we would be fine
fine in the sense that we would come out
of it about the way we are
right that's not fine if half a million
people are dead
but i thought we would come out of it
about the way we did
i heard a story that was so scary
that uh i've just never been that scared
in my life it was just the most
frightening thing i've ever heard and i
was not going to tell you
i'll tell you you are not going to hear
that story
anyway i'm glad it didn't go to the
worst case scenario
so um you know as we're watching the
story about the suez canal
and how that little choke point in our
economy will affect us all
i was starting to see a pattern here
here's a here's an interesting pattern
um if you look at
the suez canal thing the story is that
it's going to affect the world economy
right we're all affected by it
at the same time we're in the middle of
the pandemic
which is sort of a unique problem in the
sense that it's worldwide
we're also talking about you know
climate change which is
worldwide and we're talking about the
rise of china and what that means to the
world which is again a global
problem have we ever had
this many global problems it's kind of
new isn't it
i mean we've had world wars but they
seem like special cases
but now it seems that we're we're such a
connected world
that you can't do anything without
affecting everybody else
so i feel as if it's like the simulation
or god if you prefer
i feel like there's a message being sent
to us and we're not getting it
do you feel that way it feels like
let's take the assumption that there's a
god
we'll just take that that model of life
for a moment
it feels like god is just keeps tapping
us on the shoulder and saying
hey hey you can't really just take care
of yourself anymore
because we're all connected do you get
it i'll send you a pandemic see if you
get it
wait wait you're not getting it yet
right all right let's try again
i'm going to move this tanker sideways
and watch what happens
entire world will be affected tap tapped
up you get it now right
do you see that you don't get it yet
well watch this and it feels like one
thing after another is just trying to
tell us the same message
you know you're all on the same team you
know that right
team human being same side
but we're not getting it yet here's my
favorite story in the news
it's about a cat named hitler
now poor little kittler has some
markings
that look like a hitler mustache and so
the owners quite humorously named their
hitler looking cat
kittler now that was fine
everything was fine with that because
everybody knew
that uh it was just a joke but there was
a
local fox news uh weather person
who made the terrible terrible mistake
of running a cute picture of
keller on her show where i guess she was
showing some
cute animal stuff and she got a lot of
pushback
turns out that a lot of people were
offended by
killer and so she apologized
now i want to play her apology because
remember i told you that the apologies
for all the the wokeness mistakes
the apologies are becoming hilarious
because the the distinction between
parody
and the real world has just disappeared
you can't tell the difference between a
joke
and somebody literally trying to be
sincere
you can't tell the difference let's see
if you can tell the difference
is she really apologizing or is this a
joke
i did make a mistake during our caturday
segment i used a submitted photo of a
cat with an inappropriate name i don't
want to use the name here but
i never intended to hurt or offend
anyone by using that picture
that was actually just given to me i
understand my mistake and i'm deeply
sorry
and in the future i will absolutely be
more diligent with this content to
ensure it never happens again
15 degrees below zero all right
so the punch line the punch line is i'll
be more diligent with this type of
material
to make sure it never happens again
because you know because you know the
the big risk here
oh we you know we can accept that it
happened once
but man you don't want this to happen
again do you
because how can we go on
so uh i would like to join in
in solidarity with this weather person
who has now apologized
and i would like to say too that i'm
going to learn from this
i'm going to learn from this some of you
never learn
but i learned from this and
my plans of showing a picture of a cat
that looks like hitler
i've changed them i was going to show a
picture of a cat that looked like hitler
but now i know
that would be insensitive so i'm not
going to do it
i learn maybe you don't
well in new york and i guess in other
places they're going to have a
vaccination passport
that looks like so there'll be some kind
of an app
that you can show if you're going to
certain kinds of events
that says i've been vaccinated what do
you think of that
i don't really understand the the uh
the resistance to this now i understand
there is a lot of resistance
and people really really care about it
and it looks like
i don't know it looks like we're all
going to be branded and tattooed and
sent to the concentration camps or
something
somebody's saying is it a hipaa
violation well not if you do it
voluntarily
or maybe you mean some other point i'm
not sure
but all of you who said you know i knew
it was coming
are you really worried about this of all
the things that you have to worry about
this might be the smallest problem in
the world well no
the smallest problem in the world is
kettler hitler is the smallest problem
in the world
this might be the second smallest
do you really think this is going to go
wrong
in what way what exactly is the argument
that this is going to go wrong somebody
says it's a freedom violation
is it
and i'm seeing people are just going
nuts in the comments over on youtube
they're swearing at me with the f word
even for just bringing up the topic
my freedom my freedom
you know literally everything you do for
your health
affects your freedom almost every law we
make
affects your freedom everything you do
to be polite affects your freedom we
don't do anything that doesn't affect
your freedom
we all of our choices are trade-offs of
i'll give up a little freedom to get a
little bit more of this
let me ask you this if you had two
choices
there are no there are no mass events
or if you would like to attend
optionally
nobody's forcing you to do it you don't
have to go to the event
but if you want to attend you'll show a
little thing that says you're
you're safe is that a big problem
i mean seriously i get the point
that maybe something could get out of
control or whatever but if you were
going to rank this
on your top 100 problems is this in the
top 100
because i can't i can't even generate a
little bit of caring about it
like i i'm i'm not even close to being
mad at it
i can't even care about it it doesn't
even seem like an issue
am i missing this completely nobody's
going to lose their freedom
you're gaining freedom because if you
don't have this thing
you will never be able to have the event
the event won't happen
so doesn't that give you more freedom
because then now you can go to a thing
that you couldn't go to before
okay now maybe you would say but how
about we just have the big events and
everybody can go
we'll get there do you think this is
permanent
i don't think it's permanent i don't
worry about anything that's temporary
let me give you a uh a philosophy that
might help you a little bit
don't worry about anything that's
temporary that's it
that's some of the best advice you'll
ever hear in your life
don't worry about anything that's
temporary
worry about the big stuff now
i hear a slippery slope and they're
boiling a frog and they're getting us
used to
all this control and all that but do you
think they don't already know where you
are in your phone
i mean they're already tracking you on
your phone they can listen to you if
they want
you your privacy is largely gone and i
i'm not
so he says it's segregation
i i here's the thing all of your
all of your complaints about this are
just sort of like weird conceptual
complaints
i just don't think any of us real i
think this is your smallest problem
but should i be wrong about that
i know you'll let me know in the future
[Music]
so saturday night live is starting to uh
let's say gently mock the biden
administration
uh michael j had a really good one on he
did the
weekend update and as he was reading the
fake news he said biden was asked
if he plans to run for re-election in
2024
which is probably the nicest way to ask
if he plans to be alive in three years
now what's great about this joke is
that's exactly what i was thinking when
i heard the question
i thought are you really asking if you
think he's
if you think you're going to be alive in
three years
and of course biden had to say you know
his presumption was that he would
run for reelection but there's no way he
thinks that
there isn't the slightest chance that
biden thinks he's running for
re-election
do you think that there's no chance of
that
um here's a story
that made me laugh and let's see if you
laugh for the same reason
so uh journalist cheryl atkinson you
probably are all familiar with her um
she tweeted that she's looking for some
story assistance
and she tweets for a story i'm looking
for a fairly large group of georgians
who want to vote who want to vote but
cannot get an
id please dm me if you have any leads
now what do you think's gonna now here's
what makes me laugh
we haven't done that yet one of the
biggest stories in the country
is the georgia election law changes
and and the biggest part of that is
requiring identification
because if you didn't have it you
wouldn't be able to vote at least
for mail and stuff and
uh cheryl atkinson is the first person
to say maybe we could find one of these
people
these these alleged people who have no
id but want to vote
do they exist here's my prediction
i'll be surprised if you can find three
in the whole state i'll be surprised
now that doesn't mean there are there
are fewer than three i'm saying that
there are probably so few
that if you could find three it would be
a little bit of a miracle
now there are two problems here one is i
don't know that then he exists
if we get one we'll find out but
how hard is it to find someone who
doesn't have an id
and also has the second criteria that
they wanted to vote but they couldn't
how do you even find people who don't
have an id like
are they on twitter if they are how
i mean i guess you could be somehow but
yeah and so here's what made me laugh
why is cheryl atkinson the first person
to ask this question
hey can you help me find some of these
people the entire
the biggest story in the country is
based on the assumption
that there are lots of them and nobody
asked to find one
until cheryl atkinson asked hey
i don't know where they are never seen
one
never met one does anybody have one
can anybody find one
what's it tell you that only one
journalist
even asked the question
what's that tell you it tells you
there's no interest in knowing if it's
even real
except for cheryl atkinson and i of
course will be very interested in
reading what she comes up with on this
but
it just amazes me that nobody did this
and let me give you another example this
do you remember when after the
charlottesville fine people hoax thing
happened
do you remember all the press who went
and talked to the people who attended
to find out for sure just by talking to
the attendees
whether there were people that could be
described as fine people
wouldn't you want to know that don't you
think that the news organization should
have done exactly what cheryl
atkinson did and say hey does anybody
know any
anybody who meets that description
because the entire story is about
whether they exist or not and nobody
checked
to see if they exist just think about
that
just hold that thought for a moment it
was gigantic story and still
is and the entire thing boiled down to
were there people there who a reasonable
person would say no you're not a racist
you you had other reasons to be there
as far as i know only one person in the
world
did that me i did that
i tweeted hey was anybody there who
would describe themselves as a fine
person
or something like that and people
contacted me
and i interviewed them and found out
that indeed people who
in my opinion you know did a good job of
explaining that they don't have racial
racial biases in this particular way
and didn't didn't like the racists who
were there did not
did not agree with them at all disavowed
them completely
i'm the only one who checked i'm the
only one
who checked on the biggest story of the
year
that's not i'm not making that up i'm
the only one who checked
right and now cheryl atkinson is
literally the only person in the world
asking the biggest question about the
biggest story
are there any have you ever met one
all right so it made me laugh uh
speaking of laughs
so san francisco has decided to
start paying a thousand dollars a month
guaranteed income
to artists in san francisco
who and especially whose artistic
practice is rooted in a historically
marginalized community
so if you're not white it looks like
they really really want to give you some
money
and this works out for me a lot of you
are offended by that but
since i started identifying as black
i like this idea now because i'm
because i'm an artist kind of i'm sort
of an artist
and also now that i've identified with
i've self-identified as a member of a
historically marginalized community
i think my people need need this this
money
so yes i think san francisco should
start giving money
to my people the artists from the
historically
marginalized communities and um
doesn't it make you wonder if they're
still trying
are they still trying the government of
san francisco
or is it now just sort of like
performance art they're trying to figure
out what's the most ridiculous thing
you'll go along with
watch this watch this we're going to
tell people
that our our artists are essential
and see if we can just like give them
money
and and somebody would say no they'll
never they're not gonna buy that
nobody's gonna think artists are
essential in a pandemic and that you
should give them money
because they're essential nobody's going
to believe that
watch this watch this i'm going to sell
this
the difference between a government
doing what a government should do and a
practical joke
has completely evaporated the actual
government decisions
you can't tell anymore if they're
practical jokes
now there should be some version of
let's say the touring test for
government
now if you're familiar with the touring
test t-u-r-i-n-j named after
turing and it was the test to see if
your artificial intelligence
could fool somebody to make them think
that they're a real human being
and the test at least conceptually is
that
behind a curtain there's somebody
talking you don't know if it's the
computer
or or a person or they're typing either
way
and you ask them questions you have a
conversation and if you can't tell
it's alan turing thank you for the first
name if you can't tell that it's a
computer on the other side do you think
it might be human then you've passed
the touring test but if you can tell
oh that's obviously a computer then you
failed
but i feel like there's some kind of
touring test going on with our
government right now
where you hear it you hear a new policy
out of san francisco and you say to
yourself
um i'm not so sure
was that a real one or was that a prank
i can't tell and if you fool me
you've passed the equivalent of the
turing test i'm going to call it the
atoms test
or should i call it the dilbert test
i think dilbert is more famous so let's
let's do the dilbert test
so the dilbert test is a updated version
of the touring test
and the dura and the the at the dilver
test
i guess you could apply this to a
company as well as a government
yeah actually let's do that since it's a
dilbert test
let's apply it to corporations or
organizations of any kind
government or not if you can't tell
if it's a joke or real
you've uh you've passed the tour the
dilbert test
all right
next week i'm going in to re-record my
audio book of how to failed almost
everything
and still win big if you don't know the
backstory of that
back in 2006 i believe i lost my ability
to speak
so i couldn't talk my vocal chords would
clench
when i tried to make certain sounds so i
could make noise but it would sound like
oh
you know basically people couldn't
understand sentences
and i just finished my book how to fail
almost everything
still went big and although it was years
after that
after surgery and you know years of
recovery from my voice
but i i hired a voice artist to do that
book for me
because i couldn't get through a whole
book my voice wouldn't have
lasted but if there's one thing you know
about me by now
is that i am one stubborn
and i i hate to lose
and i don't know i will wait forever to
get revenge
i will wait forever to fix something
that wasn't right
like i will chew through a
concrete wall
to get something done that just needed
to get done
if you don't know anything else about me
you should know that
and i have never been more bugged by the
fact that i couldn't read
my own book but
um as you've noticed i have now spent
at least one hour a day every day
for several years now talking in public
until i can do this
finally i can finally do this
it took me years
but i don't like to give up and so
tomorrow i'm going in the studio and i
will re-record
and then we'll re-release the book
cattle failed almost everything
and still win big because
if you write a book called how to win it
how to fail at everything and still win
big
and you give up before you record it
properly
well you have not lived up to your own
book so
i'm going to get this done it's not
going to be easy
because the recording is always
unpleasant it takes days
but i have rebuilt my voice to the point
where not only
can i read record this book um
but i think i'll be happy with how it
will come out
so that's just a little personal update
for you
clarification we i thought that uh vice
president
kamal harris would be assigned to the
border control
situation but apparently she's being
assigned just to the international
affairs part
where she'll deal with the central
american countries
to see if we can make them more
attractive for staying
there and that is
that tells us a little bit more about
the future
if they had put kamala harris in charge
of border security
do you remember what i said about that
it's like uh are they trying to get rid
of her
because that's like a suicide mission
nobody's ever going to succeed
about the actual your border itself that
you can't succeed half the country is
just going to hate your guts no matter
what
maybe three quarters but you probably
could succeed
doing something that would maybe help
the central american countries
you know do a little better job of being
an attractive place to stay
and that's more of a presidential kind
of a job isn't it
so instead of giving there this suicide
mission
uh she's really gonna have a very high
level job
and if she were to succeed in that at
all it would put her in good position
for running for president so it's i
would say at this point
that is helping her future
so christina and i went out to eat last
night in my
uh san francisco east bay neighborhood
and there was the most fun
thing um
you know what we're all looking for
these little signs of life you know that
the the world is getting back to normal
and the economy is going back to where
it was
and let me tell you what i saw when we
went went out to dinner
um i've never seen so many senior
citizens
out to dinner right i'm not counting
myself necessarily in this group
i'm on the bubble but i'm talking about
70 and older the restaurants
are crushed with vaccinated seniors
[Laughter]
the restaurants are crushed they're
crushed
couldn't get in and we did get in but
finally you know we found the place but
you go there and it's over 70
over 70 over 70. and oh my god it's just
great to see
it is great to see i have to have to
admit it
it affected me um
so and we ate indoors for the first time
uh well the first time in a while eight
indoors
yeah but the funny thing is it's like
the night of the living vaccinated
because you know obviously you go out to
dinner there'll always be
you know a good dose of senior citizens
anywhere you go
out to dinner but uh not like this
you go out to dinner and as soon as you
get into the restaurant areas
it's like night of the living vaccinated
you know
i got my second shot give me
restaurant food let me in
i got two shots so
i think i'm eligible uh i believe my
eligibility kicks in
uh this week so sometime this week i
might get a first shot if i can if i can
find access to it somewhere
uh dr burks is saying that uh
that because we handle things wrong in
this country
and if we had handled it more like let's
say germany um
the all the deaths over the first
hundred thousand might have been
mitigated or reduced to which
a doctor i don't know his name but said
something
was on tv said yeah that's great dr
burks
it was your job to make sure that didn't
happen
is that fair so berks is saying we
handled it wrong and
all these people died and then somebody
else is saying
that's on you that's on you
if you didn't if you didn't talk the
government into doing what you knew was
right
why are you complaining because your job
is not just to tell them what to do
your job is to talk them into it it's
not
just your job to know what they should
have done
your job was to make them do it
and let me be as clear as possible if
you couldn't make them do it
your job was to quit
really publicly right let's just be as
clear about this as we can
her job was to make this happen since
she says
she knows this is what we should have
done her job was to make it happen
or quit right in front of us
so that we know who the problem is if
the problem is you couldn't talk
some idiot into doing what you want let
us know
that's your job your job is not
to complain about it after you're out
that was not your job you did not do
your job lady
do it right or quit so that we know
what the problem was who the problem was
all right
so i i issued a challenge on twitter to
see if somebody could
um win sidney powell's case the lawsuit
in which dominion is suing cindy powell
for libel i guess
defamation or libel or whatever the
proper legal word
is and i said try to win her case in one
sentence
you know just the first sentence try to
try to win the whole case
and i gave you uh my take on this so
here's a sentence
that i believe cindy powell's uh lawyer
could say one thing and then just sit
down
and just be done and we'll see if you
agree that this is one thing that would
win the case and it goes like this so
imagine
the sydney powell defense attorney
looking at the
jury i guess it's a jury and saying
quote uh or potential quote
i'm a lawyer advocating for my client
and mrs powell
and i'm wondering how many of you think
everything i say about
dominion today should be assumed
to be a fact and then you just sit down
and say uh the defense rests
nothing else you'd have to say now of
course they would
but think about this point
do you think that anybody in the jury
would look at the defense
attorney and say oh yeah i am it is my
plan
i plan to believe everything you tell me
nobody nobody would say that because
everybody in the jury
understands because they're adults and
they were at least capable enough to be
chosen for jury duty
so you have to show a little bit of
human capability or
you're not on the jury every person on
the jury would listen to that and say
well no i'm not going to believe it just
because you say it
you're a lawyer you're advocating for a
client
in this context we only believe evidence
if you show me evidence i may or may not
believe the evidence
but i'm sure as hell not going to
believe it because it came out of your
stupid mouth
your job is to persuade me your job is
not to be
true your job is not to tell me the
truth if you're a defense attorney
your job is to do the best you can to
get your
client free that's it now let me tell
you
how many adults don't understand that
none every single adult
understands that an attorney advocating
for a client
is going to say things that you need to
check
right everybody knows if you can't check
it
you shouldn't think it's necessarily
true
so the uh the weird part is that the
defense attorney would be in exactly the
same position as
powell herself was because she was a
defense attorney
or maybe more of an offense in this case
but uh
it's the analogy is perfect it's not
even an analogy it's
it's basically the same thing and this
is an example if you're following my
persuasion lessons of what i call the
high ground
maneuver do you know how often the high
ground
maneuver which is a persuasion trick
i'll explain a little bit more in a
moment
do you know how often the high ground
maneuver works
every time it's probably the only
persuasion method
that works every time because there's
there's a uh
and there's a reason for this people
don't care about facts
right you understand that right so if
i'm trying to persuade you with my
better reasons and my facts we observe
that people just harden their
opposition the facts don't persuade
anybody
but everybody
wants to avoid looking foolish
it's universal so if you're in a meeting
or in your
business situation and there's something
that would make you look foolish
you're going to change your mind
immediately because you don't want to
look foolish
so regardless of what you think about
the truth of the world
you're going to protect yourself first
so the high ground maneuver
creates a situation where the person
you're trying to persuade
has to protect themselves this is the
key
they're protecting themselves as opposed
to
protecting their argument if you give
somebody a choice of i'm going to let
you protect your argument
or i'm going to let you protect yourself
they'll choose themselves
every time that's why that's why it
works every time
now you don't always have the
opportunity to use it right
so not every situation will lend itself
to a
a high ground technique you have to it
has to be there
and you have to recognize it so it has
to naturally sort of be in the situation
and the high ground in this case
is that you you adults in the jury
are certainly smarter than the public in
general right
you're not so gullible that you would
believe that somebody whose job is to
persuade you
is also always telling you the truth
you're well above that are you not
because the person sitting next to you
is above it
and the person behind you they're above
that
they know how lawyers work they know the
difference between
an honest person and an advocate but
you don't because you know all the other
people seem to understand this
right so as soon as you create the
situation where
if you stay with your opinion
you will look like the only person who
doesn't understand something that
everyone understands
because everyone understands lawyers or
advocates
not a source of truth everyone
understands that
the moment you've you've painted that
picture
everybody goes to the high ground with
you because they can't stay here
they look like idiots right
so you're not making them uh defend
their argument
you're making them defend themselves do
you want to see her being the only idiot
who doesn't understand that lawyers are
not supposed to tell the truth
well i'll say that wrong they're
supposed to tell the truth
but nobody expects it no reasonable
person
expects it that's it that's the end of
the trial
all right um i'm oversimplifying of
course
trials are more complicated than that
but if you wanted to understand the high
ground maneuver this is just the best
example
you you couldn't get a better example
than this
um twitter user john
katz ktz i believe he has a podcast
so he's somebody in the public he had a
tweet that i just love
this is just the greatest tweet and when
i read this to you
you're going to say why did it take
somebody so long to say this
all right here's his tweet quote you
think your ar-15 will work against a
government with tanks
so he's he's mocking the people on the
left who have two opinions
that don't seem to fit together all
right so here are their two opinions
that they think an ar-15 will work
i'm sorry let me stop screwing this up
he's mocking the people
who are saying that having ar-15s will
be
no use against the government with tanks
all right so one of the arguments for
owning guns is that it protects you in
case your government turns against you
and the democrats say you fool
you fool are you telling me
that you think that a bunch of
hillbillies with their ar-15s
are gonna are gonna like protect against
the government with
tanks seriously you think that
now the same people who are asking you
that as john katz points out
are also telling you that these same
hillbillies i'm just using hillbillies
to be provocative
uh almost took over the government with
bear spray
both of those messages are out there at
the same time
don't be ridiculous you're not going to
be able to defend the public with just
your little rifles
against tanks and nukes at the same time
you know if you've got some bear spray
you could pretty much take out the
government
and it was this close the bear spray
people
almost got it done almost got it done
and both of those messages are out there
completely
seriously like nobody's even embarrassed
by that
nobody's embarrassed that they hold both
of those positions
and a lot of people do now usually uh i
saw this
comment on twitter as well that uh
something like 90
of twitter arguments is somebody
imagining somebody who doesn't exist and
being mad at them
you know the person who holds this
opinion but also
you know uh hypocritically holds this
other opinion
and usually that person doesn't exist
it'd be hard to find somebody who
actually held those literally two
opposing opinions
but this is one where this is real
i'm pretty sure that this describes
almost the entire democratic party i
believe
that most of democrats would agree with
both of these sentences
that conflict and i don't think that
they have any problem with it like
they're not
there's no there's no interior conflict
with thinking that uh both of these
could be true
um and of course trump caused trouble by
referring to the
capital riots as having you know
basically zero
zero danger uh
what he meant of course was as an
overthrow to the government
now or at least i hope i hope he meant
there was zero danger
in terms of an overthrow of the
government obviously there was physical
danger
and plenty of it all right uh
90 of baseball is half mental
say uh yogi yogi berra
yeah mind reading i don't want to mind
read so i'll back up on that point
you know the the mind reading flaw uh
is just the stickiest thing isn't it and
once you start seeing it
in other people you can recognize that
they're involved in mind reading
but it doesn't help you not do it
yourself
it's really really hard to not fall into
the mind-reading trap where you
confidently imagine you know what other
people are thinking because you never do
you're terrible with that your your
accuracy is just terrible with that
um he said they were kissing the capitol
police
maybe some of them were
um there's another carjacking yeah
you know the whole uh let me ask you
this
uh our entire media is now
obsessed lately with the uh the violence
against asian americans
let me start by saying we don't want any
violence against asian americans
so i think we're all on the same side
that violence against
anybody's bad violence against an ethnic
group in particular
takes something that's already really
really bad and adds that extra badness
right we're all on the same side
nobody likes violence
but let me ask you this do you believe
that the mainstream media
would be reporting about all this
anti-asian bias
if china we're not making it happen
yeah think about it is it a coincidence
that china has advanced ai
to the point where they can influence
the conversation and the argument in the
united states
and there would be no thing that would
be better for china
than to create as a national story
anti-asian in this case asian-american
mostly
anti-asian discrimination as the top
headline story
do you think that this story is
originating in america
it might it might
right i will think so
i'm going to tell you something that
might scare the out of you
we no longer live in a world where the
default
assumption is that this is a natural
story
the default assumption is that it came
from china
and that they're manipulating the united
states
through a variety of means to make this
the main story
now do i know do i know that
no no i don't know it i can't give you
evidence of it
etc do i think that this would be a good
play
yes if china were to do this and
if they pulled it off it would be a
really good play
because it's exactly the kind of thing
that would prevent the united states
from going hard in china
because somebody's going to say hey are
you going hard at china because
you need to or is it really sort of a
racist thing
because i'm sure china noticed that we
have trouble dealing with our southern
border because
because the internal politics
are that we're fighting over whether
that's really about racism
that's why we can't deal with our own
border what would china like to do
in terms of how the united states deals
with china's
you know aggressive growth china would
like the united states to be arguing
about whether that's a racist policy
and they succeeded in the sense that
it's happening
all we're talking about is is the
country racist against asians and asian
americans
if that's the top thing you're talking
about
what's the default assumption in a world
of ai and social media
and intelligence agencies really behind
most of the big stuff
the default intelligence i'm sorry
the default assumption should be that
this is coming from china
that doesn't mean it is but the default
assumption should be
if you don't know if you can't tell one
way or the other
the default assumption is that it's
china if you don't get that
you're you're a few years behind
because in 2021 that is the default
assumption
and if you don't know that you think the
news is real
it might be i can't rule that out
i'm just saying that if you don't think
china is behind
this being the headlines in this country
you are
probably naive probably naive
so um here's something to
look for see how many times our internal
news
is focused on a story that
coincidentally
would have some kind of a benefit to one
of our
foreign adversaries or even allies
how many of our internal stories look
like they were seeded by another country
because coincidentally that would be
really good for that other country be it
an ally or an adversary because remember
our intelligence agencies
are putting influence on both
adversaries and enemies
so you know there's no reason to think
that
our adversaries are not doing the same
thing to us just in different ways for
different interests
um
so you can fill in you can fill in the
names of those other countries
as easily as i can all right
uh as a black american will you be
making any edits to how to fill and
everything
well i don't think that that the book
needs to be edited
for that reason um
should we suspect foreigners or
democrats well here's
here's why if china is behind these
headlines
the democrats would be let's say
so interested in the same story that
they would easily allow it
if not being a participant
um
thank you yes um now that i have an
interracial marriage
i feel that i understand things a little
bit better
i didn't have one until recently when i
i
started identifying as black
and by the way the the great thing about
identifying is black
is that i get to be on the winning team
for a while
you know and it's funny because uh
i actually feel that the
the the moment i started identifying as
black
uh i started looking at the news
differently and
and i said people are so automatically
team oriented they
if you just say you're on a team
suddenly you start rooting for that team
it's just automatic you can't turn it
off and suddenly i'm looking at the news
differently and i sort of got this true
i'm looking at the news differently and
look i'm thinking all right
looks like my team's doing pretty well
today they're
they're doing really well today
somebody says i'm not black i think
you're a racist
so there's some racist on here saying
that i'm not black
now i understand that visually it seems
like that but i think we're well passed
well past the visual part being your
identity aren't we
aren't we all past that it doesn't
matter what i look like
that's that's no longer a criteria and
should not be
i'm i'm fully on board with that no
longer being a criteria
because you wouldn't want to say who's
the
one of my brothers the uh black activist
show on
what's his name sean
somebody tell him the last name but he's
a famous
black activist that people say is not
physically black enough
and i say that's that is offensive sean
king
thank you so i um i defend
sean king because racist saying that
he's not black enough so he can't
self-identify as black that's purely
racist
and i would i will defend
offend my brother sean king as much as i
would defend
myself because we're in the same
situation
not the same you know nothing's the same
but everybody's different
but uh i i feel it
i feel it all right that's all i've got
for now
and i will talk to you all tomorrow
tomorrow yeah i'll see you tomorrow bye
for now
all right youtubers i got you for
another minute here
uh famous on tick tock
well good for you
why are you laughing
um
is that a word what does that mean
all right that's enough for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
