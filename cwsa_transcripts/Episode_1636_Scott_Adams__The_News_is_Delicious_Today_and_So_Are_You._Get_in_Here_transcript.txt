good morning everybody and welcome to
the best damn thing that's ever happened
to you
now i might i may have said that before
but this time i'm gonna deliver because
the news has been kind to us and given
us
great stories to talk about
while you're doing your morning exercise
or morning coffee or whatever the hell
you're doing this morning just keep it
up though i can tell from here you're
doing a good job
come on push it push it all right
good
now if you'd like to take it up a notch
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker gel style canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
i think i i had a little bit of a slurp
with a sip
now
you want your sip to be pure
without the slurp
but up to a ten percent
up to a 10
sip to slurp ratio would still be
acceptable beyond 10
nobody wants to be around you
if you know what i mean
babylon b has an important report as you
know
the babylon bee is the last remaining
credible
publication
and they've got a breaking story out of
sacramento
daring midday train robberies are the
latest phenomena to flourish in the
golden state
these rail heists along with a dearth of
electricity and banishment of gas
vehicles
have led to california rebranding with a
vintage old west theme
so if you were thinking of uh
taking the family
to a nice summer vacation someplace
that's like a theme park
uh california used to be a bunch of
traffic and
stuff and movies and stuff and boring
things
but now we've got this whole wild west
thing we've got
outdoor bathrooms
indoor plumbing completely unnecessary
we've got uh
yeah we've we've got
tribes living
living among us
pretty much an old west theme
so yesterday
my step daughter uh mentioned some
comments about something i had posted on
instagram
and i said
i didn't post anything on instagram
and she said yes you did
and i said
i'd know if i posted something on
instagram
and she said
you posted something on instagram
and then i said
what did i post on instagram
well apparently
uh you can pocket post
now it wasn't really that bad i had
considered posting and i recall
preparing a post
and then deleting it because it was too
obnoxious
because once i saw it i said to myself
you know
this seemed like a good idea
but this is really a bad idea it's like
a really bad idea
like i didn't it's sort of don't not
reading the room right if you know what
i mean
sometimes things will be okay in a
certain context but not in another
well this is one of those
shouldn't have been posted but
since it's already out there i'm going
to share it with you who is this picture
i don't know if you'll be able to see it
well
you see this it's a interior of a
vehicle
and
here's the back story
i had been wanting to purchase an
american vehicle
and it took me the longest time you know
at one point i tried to buy a truck from
ford
but i never could pull the trigger
because i have a rule that i've got to
be able to drive the vehicle or one like
it before i'll purchase and that isn't
an option
you can't drive the you can't even drive
the truck you want to buy or even one
like it because they just don't carry
them on the lots so i couldn't buy a
truck
well time goes by and i've been driving
an suv for a decade because it's just
convenient for everything
and i thought it was time for
a smaller fun american car
and so tried to buy a mustang
and you got caught right in the uh the
squeeze
the the squeeze of the unavailability of
cars
but three months later
it got delivered
and you know that's what it looks like
that's the interior
you can see it's
red seats
and
i i have to tell you this just as a
like context
i'm not a car guy
at all
you know what when i i used to think i
might be as a kid but as soon as i had
enough money that i could afford
a car that i wanted
i kind of didn't care anymore like i
realized there was something about the
psychology of just owning nice things or
something
so it wasn't like a real basic
biological need or anything so i've
always
just taken cars
that did what i needed them to do now
i've had mostly driven bmws here's the
obnoxious part if you can get over that
fact i'm going to say some nice things
about some american products here in a
moment
the uh so i've had experience with nice
sporty
high-end cars but i wanted an american
car
and i i'm just sort of in love with the
way the mustangs look
just the design i think ford in general
has the strongest design
maybe in the business right now maybe in
the business would anybody agree with
that
depending on you know whatever class of
car you're looking at
i feel like theirs are better just to
look at they just look better designed
than other cars with similar definitely
better than all the japanese cars
there's not one japanese car
in my opinion that's competitive with
you know ford's line of just in terms of
their look now that could be also a
cultural thing maybe maybe they just
design better for american tastes
but so i get this car and i didn't know
what to expect
because i had never driven a mustang
and
the first time i got in this thing
remember i'm not a car guy i'm just not
impressed by cars and when people show
me their new car i'm like ah
you know that's great yeah
but i don't really care i just i just
have no interest in cars whatsoever
but i sat in this thing
and i had an experience
like i had an experience
and it doesn't wear off
and let me tell you
this is the best way i can explain it
if you're in a
well-designed german vehicle
the vehicle especially a bmw it'll make
you feel like there's no difference
between the car and you
like you just merge with a bmw it
becomes
just part of your body almost
so if you're driving a bmw and you say
i'm here but i want to be up there you
just sort of think it and the next thing
you know you're up there like there
there's no friction between your
thoughts and the execution
and so that's one thing that makes it
driving a bmw kind of thrilling because
you feel something that's
bigger than just driving if i can say it
that way
so i get in this car and i'd never felt
this feeling before
which was it was opposite of the feeling
that the car
was me
the feeling was
i was partnering with a wild animal
that temporarily at least was willing to
do what i wanted it to do
oh my god is that exciting it is
exciting
like the the the feel of the engine like
the the vibration
the color
i mean
god they nailed this
i mean i can't say enough about this so
um um
american engineering looking good all
right here's a good fake story from
uh the blaze
now the blaze is not uh responsible for
the fakeness of the story so they were
just reporting what the police reported
all right
so the so the police have reported this
allegedly there's a shocking cell phone
video
capturing the moment an armed robber
shot at a man he had stopped on a busy
houston's highway
but police say he later accidentally
shot himself in the head
during a struggle
now how do you interpret this story do
you think that there was a man in
houston
who accidentally shot himself in the
head
let me tell you how i interpret this
story
did i mention that it's in texas
how would you interpret this story if it
happened in florida
now if this happened in florida
the way i'd imagine it was oh florida
man shoots himself in the head that's
just a tuesday
right i mean i have to think that in
florida there's probably
eight to nine
episodes of people shooting themselves
in the head accidentally
are you daily
i mean that's florida less like florida
man always does funny things
but when you read this story in texas
about a man who you know pulled a gun on
somebody else
but in the heat of the struggle the man
who pulled the gun
accidentally shot himself in the head
in texas
well there's at least one other way to
interpret this
and it goes like this
somebody pulled the gun in texas
and it took three seconds for somebody
else to put a bullet in his skull
before he could pull the trigger himself
the police arrive they see exactly what
happened
and they say oh did you take care of
this yeah i just took care of that for
you you know the paperwork would be a
lot easier
if we just say he shot himself in the
head
you can go on with your day sir thank
you for your service thank you officer
have a good day
make sure to reload you you're a bullet
short ha i'll remember
i don't know
i don't know we're in that period where
you don't trust anything about anything
so i'm just saying if this had been a
florida story
i would have seen it differently
in the most important news of the day
disney has decided that minnie mouse
will no longer be in her iconic little
skirt
but rather we'll be wearing a pant suit
that's right minnie minnie mouse will
now be in a pant suit
now
i don't know
if there's any truth to the rumor
that hillary clinton is secret secretly
running the government from behind the
scenes
but when i see disney put minnie mouse
in a pet suit
i start to think it's a possibility
we're not done with this story
a lot of people say
that disney went too far
went too far
that's not my take i think they did not
go far enough
i think that they need to start
specifying her sexual preference
now putting her in pantsuits i get it i
get it
i receive the hint
wink wink we know what you're trying to
say
but this is 2022 disney you can just say
it
she she may or may not be a lesbian
doesn't matter because it's 20 22
but
i feel like you should specify
you know don't don't hint at it just go
right at it
now uh one of the critics of this move
was candice owens
who
correct me if i'm wrong give me a fact
check
candice owens wears a lot of pantsuits
am i right
however
she can definitely pull them off
well no that's the wrong way to put it
she can pull it off meaning she can pull
off the look
i'm sure i'll be quoted out of context
there
but
um
so
so if you if you if you can make it work
and she definitely does
um
but she had some things to say about
that
now i think we need a trans mouse as
well
so two mice
two mice is
i don't think two mice is enough
mice does not represent all of the mice
in the public
and i think we need a we should
definitely have an lgbtq a whole range
of mice
to do this right
now
um
by the way i i don't want to give away
some secrets here but i met candace
owens once
um
yeah that fox news thing we're we're
both on
on the same day
so she came over and uh introduced
herself and i gotta say she was one of
the warmest people you'll ever meet in
your life
like you know how some people you meet
them and just instantly
you just instantly like them
she has that that thing that kind of
charisma that just
lights up her room
so she just definitely has the real
thing
um
but anyway
that's the minnie mouse story now here's
a question about uh desantis and this
this is really interesting to me
because desantis is a
in my opinion he's a near legendary good
decision maker
would anybody disagree with that now of
course if you're on the left you
disagree with everything he does but
within the context of a
republican candidate
my goodness he makes good decisions
they're they're compatible and smart and
defensible and makes them work and all
that stuff
so here's here's the thing that is a
challenge to that
and i'm not sure which way to take this
so here's a tweet by alexander nazarian
we tweeted at a press conference today
desantis attempted to make it seem as if
there were enough delta cases in florida
to justify the use of regeneron which is
totally ineffective against omicron
and then he goes on according to the cdc
however omicron accounts for more than
99 of cases
all right
so
so who's right
if let's say we have evidence that um
regeneron is useless against omicron
but did work against delta but 99 maybe
more by now
uh of cases or omicron so the uh i guess
the authorization has been uh pulled
and one of the things that desantis says
is you can't tell
what somebody has when they come in
but the cdc does say 99
plus percent are
omicron all right so who is the better
decision maker the tweeter who seems to
be criticizing it
or desantis himself
so uh here's the argument on one hand
on one hand does it make sense
to use a drug that you know
is 99 going to be useless
that's the point and not only 99 but
that 99 is going to go to 100 like by
the time we're done talking
right so so the usefulness of it will
basically just vanish
so that that's a pretty good argument
right now here here's what i
um i don't want to do any mind reading
but i'll give an argument i guess this
would be my own argument that also
agrees with desantis
in its own way
here's the the counter argument
none of our data has been correct yet
all right so 99 so the cdc says 99 plus
of everything is omicron
here's the counter argument none of our
data's been right
none of it
name anything that's been right
do you think we're so precise that we
can get 90 died
i mean and is the 99 also in florida
or is the 99
i guess it would be everywhere if it's
99 yeah so forget that part
and then
why wouldn't you help the one percent
is regenerate so dangerous
that if you gave it to a hundred people
and only one one of them needed it
that that would be worse than not giving
it to anybody
so i actually don't know the right
answer to this one but i think desantis
has a better argument than is
represented by his uh his critic here
what do you think
does it make sense
or is uh desantis just making a
political point
that's sort of data free
yeah the the best argument is that the
data is all incorrect and why wouldn't
you try to fix the one percent and leave
it to your doctor and
you know maybe if maybe if the symptoms
are extreme that's the only case you
even try it because that's where it
makes sense i don't know
it's a good question i wonder if
desantis got this one wrong it's hard to
say
well denmark
is uh doubling down on its february 1
thing getting rid of their mandates and
they're saying that
denmark no longer classifies coven 19 as
a quote socially critical disease
all restrictions will be lifted february
1st
boom boom
um so i i gave you some uh updates from
visiting
a place i didn't specify
in which
there was a very little masking
indoors
yesterday i returned to that same place
and
the 50 masking went to
about 25.
so in one day
that one place went from about half
masked
to 25 mast
and yeah
and
i'm not saying that i had anything to do
with it but i can tell you it's you can
definitely tell what people's politics
are when you walk through a crowded
space and and there's a mix of messed
and unmasked have you seen that yet you
go into a space and you're like
republican republican democrat
republican democrat republican
it's pretty easy now isn't it
all right
so i don't know if february 1st is we're
going to hit it but
let's talk about some more uh
thinking
one of the things i see a lot is why did
we shut down the world for something
that has a 99.9
chance of survival
most of you think that way right why did
we shut everything down if there was a
99 whatever percent chance of survival
well first of all that's an average
so the chance of survival if you were
over 70
was not so good i mean that was you know
a few percentages more than one percent
um but
still
you know they didn't have long to live
you could protect them
et cetera so it's a perfectly reasonable
point why why would you shut things down
if there was a 99.9
chance of surviving it
and i say that's a good point
and here is a additional point
so this additional point does not refute
the first point
it's just additional
it goes like this
do you want a 50 chance
of ruining one year of your life
because if you covet there's about a 50
chance you'll have long haul
which could take you out for six months
now if you get taken out for six months
it kind of screws up your whole year
i had that experience of you know i had
my prednisone experience it took me out
for about six months like for six months
i struggled but it kind of ruins your
whole year
right
so
would you
do extreme things
to stop uh half of the public from
losing a year of
quality life
now if you say if you say no to that
that's a reasonable answer it's
reasonable it's reasonable to say yes or
no but it's not reasonable to ignore it
so the the only thing i want to add to
this is don't ignore it
scott we've been locked down for two
years right and that's part that's part
of the analysis right so part of the
analysis is that being locked down has
its own set of costs you know we all
know that
so i'm not giving you an opinion i'm
just saying that you should throw that
in there and the way i would calculate
it
is yes your your your odds are dying or
low
your odds of getting messed up for a
year are pretty good
and
you know that can affect your
relationships imagine being sick for a
year
what's that do to your relationships in
your career
it's kind of messed up so don't ignore
that risk i'm just saying
you know you i'm not trying to change
your mind anything you always think i'm
trying to persuade you i'm not i'm not
i'm just saying don't forget that risk
all right the
covet olympics are coming up in china
um of the 4 000 or so arrivals so far
they've spotted 129 cases of coven
uh that's what's been reported
and at different intervals some of them
have been within the exclusion zone
so apparently you get tested pretty hard
and
and
stuff before you can even get into the
the zone where the athletes are but even
within the zone at least 50 of them have
been found within what they call the
closed loop
since january 4th
now
um here's my
here's my uh let's say logic and math
question for you
if you believe that the vaccinations
themselves
are dangerous and that the athletes have
been known to be dropping dead from them
what would you expect how many people
would you expect to die of the
professional athletes and a four
thousand
if all four thousand people compete hard
the entire time and go home and nobody
nobody dropped dead
would that change your mind about the
risk of the vaccinations because they're
all highly vaccinated
would it
suppose there were zero deaths
would you find that statistically
meaningful
because we know that these we get
reports of athletes
dropping so often
that you think you would see them
all right
how many are catching me at my trick
what's the track
all right here's the trick i was trying
to lure you into a trap
you can't compare 4 000 athletes over
two weeks
with hundreds of thousands of athletes
over years
that's not any kind of a fair comparison
so it wouldn't matter how many people
died or didn't die during the olympics
it wouldn't tell you anything about the
real world
well let me take that back
if five people dropped dead during the
olympics yeah that would tell you a lot
that would tell you a lot
but if zero people drop dead during the
olympics that won't tell you anything
do you get that
because the olympics are
really just four thousand athletes over
two weeks
you wouldn't expect
even if the vaccination was dangerous
you wouldn't expect anybody to die in
that limited little time window so you
can't compare that to all athletes all
over the world
you know high school professional
college
running all day long for two years
yeah that's a different situation
anyway
the reason i bring that up is because i
think i had misleadingly asked that
question before without clarifying it
was a dumb question
uh how many people think that the
gigantic surge in israel of uh both
deaths their deaths of covet are way up
and also not they're not way up above
previous highs but they're up
but their infection rate is just through
the roof
they're highly vaccinated
infections through the roof just just
way through the roof
and at the same time
deaths are up too
that tells you that vaccinations what
work or don't work boom tell me
israel is the most vaccinated and also
infections through the roof and death
rates climbing
bad news are good news
bad news or good news
here's the point to point on its surface
looks like pretty bad news
would you agree that on the surface
if that's all you knew
it's pretty bad news
everybody on the same page so far if
that's all you know and there's nothing
else to the story
it looks pretty bad
here's the other thing to know
there are
is almost one
it's come way down
now translation
that means that they have compressed
remember i just talked about how you
can't compare
athletes over two years
can't compare athletes over two years
with athletes over two weeks
what did omicron do
omicron is so spready
it took what would have been a longer
pandemic and compressed it into two
weeks
israel
is almost done
they're almost done
that the high spike
in all likelihood is going to go up up
up up up up up
bam
right to the ground in all likelihood
that is going to drop like a rock in
about a week
because the r is approaching one and
they've been tracking that the whole
time as it drops
now their hospitals are still doing okay
they did not
impose
economic
you know any restrictions
so israel
may have
don't know yet it's too early to say so
if you say it's too early i agree with
you
but they are on the verge of maybe
nailing this thing like nobody nailed it
or the vaccinations don't work
we'll know in about a week
so in a week or so if you don't see that
that curve just drops straight down
because everything just got compressed
that's what it should do
but if that doesn't happen well then
israel just
just made all the wrong decisions or at
least this one was wrong
right would you agree with would you
agree with my
setup
that if israel didn't lock down so they
didn't have an economic hit
they didn't crash their hospitals
they compressed their entire pandemic
into two weeks
said let's just take it now get over
with boom boom
if they get on the other side of this in
two weeks they win
they won
would you agree with me
now of course
that still doesn't count
to be fair any long-term effect of being
vaccinated itself
but ah man this is the
yeah the this is the most exciting part
of the pandemic
israel may have done it now i would uh
if you want to see more on that argument
i would refer to you to a
david boxenhorn
a tweet thread that shows you the data
that backs up what i just said
so look for david boxenhorn who's also a
really good follow by the way he's got
lots of good stuff on twitter
uh you can find him in my
twitter thread from yesterday i think um
justice breyer looks like he's going to
retire so it'll be opening in the
supreme court
uh how much does it suck for biden that
all he gets to do is replace a liberal
you know
there's there's no accounting for uh
luck
so trump gets to be president you know
when he can change the nature of the
court
it looks like biden will get to be
president when he can basically break
even
just break even i said um
i'll tell you what uh here's a good
reason you don't want me to be president
if i were president i would uh
i would advocate
uh adding one justice
so it's 10.
and balancing them liberal and
conservative
so if there were too many conservatives
i'd add a liberal and i'll try to
balance them five and five now i
wouldn't require it of anybody else
but that would be that would be what i'd
do i'd balance it and here's why if you
can't get one person from the other side
to side with you
maybe you shouldn't do it
maybe you shouldn't do it
if you can't get one person to side with
you yeah maybe you shouldn't do it now i
i get that that would not give uh
conservatives as much as they want
i get that
yeah no it's a bad take if you if you
prefer a republican agenda
here's here's the backing of it
in in all things i would back the system
over the decision
right so let me explain that
as president hypothetically i wouldn't
want to be president but as president i
would always back this system over this
specific decision
that's what uh
christian cinema just did so senator
cinema
decided to back the system by not
getting rid of the um
what do you call it the uh
the thing where they talk too much
um so backing the system
the filibuster thank you
so
senator cinema backed the system over
the decision and she actually wanted the
decision to go that way
she actually voted against her own
preference
to protect the system i think the
supreme court's credibility
is lower than it should be for our
healthy system
and i would
i would vote for keeping the health of
the system
over the
specific decision
but i would also totally respect
someone who just wants the right
decisions
there's nothing crazy about that
nothing crazy about wanting good
decisions
that you know agree with you i'm just
saying that as president you wouldn't
always get your way
you just wouldn't but that's true of
every president right name a president
who gives everybody what they want
you're not going to get that president i
would just be consistent and say look if
it's ever a question of the system
versus the specific output i'm just
going to go with the system because this
is more important
then i would never get a second term
all right so uh
biden has said that he will only
consider for the supreme court a black
female candidate
um now as you know i've been identifying
as black for some time primarily for the
benefits
and also because i
you know relate having been
discriminated
for employment a number of times
um so i certainly identify with anybody
who says
the culture is discriminated against
them economically i get that
been there too many times
however i realize that my strategy is
lacking and it would be much smarter for
me to
upgrade my self-identification which i i
do today so as of today i identify as a
black female
now i know it's a long shot
that joe biden would nominate me to the
supreme court i don't really have a
legal background and
probably don't agree with everything he
would like to do
but
unlike the rest of you losers
who have no chance whatsoever unless
you're also
a black woman
so
it's just me and the rest of
the rest of my sisters
all the other black women we have a shot
still
so i just don't like to ever be out of
the conversation you know
it would be one thing to say well we we
prefer not picking you scott
for the supreme court
and by the way do you know you can't
spell scotus without scott
they only use one t but i don't hold
that against them yeah you can't spell
scottish without scott
um and within us
and without us
hey i just realized that that's what
this is
it's scott
and us
we are the supreme court of the united
states for all practical purposes
because that's how it works
well sorry you don't have a chance
to be in the supreme court but my odds
are still looking good
all right
uh fifth according to rasmussen poll 55
of voters believe the dems or democrats
are too liberal
generally speaking a hundred percent of
our data says that democrats are going
to get
shellacked in 2022.
but do you think that the shellacking
they're likely to get in 2022
will be the reason that they might win
in 2024
because the country does like a divided
government we do like that divided
government thing
i've got a feeling that the democrats
would have a real good case
if they lost you know the congress
entirely
that they would have to say well you
can't lose the presidency too that's too
far that would be pretty motivating for
their base
so i think it's going to be tough for a
republican to get through that
that wall
there is a new kind of doctor that i was
exposed to twice today i'll call them
the lol doctors
where you say something that
you think seems perfectly reasonable
uh
and a doctor chimes in on twitter with
lol no
to which i say oh okay
you know i i i grant the superior
expertise of the lol doctors
and i thank you for your service
because
what i said was that if you could
quickly test if there were some
available over-the-counter tests for
vitamin d
and you just tested everybody for
vitamin d then the pandemic would be
over
and a medical doctor came in and said
lol no
like oh okay well now i see why my idea
wouldn't work
because at first i was saying well this
is perfectly reasonable because the high
correlation between vitamin d and bad
outcomes if you knew who was susceptible
not only could you try to give them
vitamin d that might help a little bit
but more importantly you would know who
was at greatest risk
so they could take greater care and i
thought that made sense given the data
that i'd seen but
the counter argument to that is
lol
no
so
i bow to their expertise
well here's a gigantic surprise
uh
the u.s decided to give russia
absolutely nothing to ask for despite
asking for totally reasonable things
why
well why is it oh i'm sorry i didn't
talk about kamala harris being
potentially a supreme court uh pick
um
jack possabic has some reporting that
says has not even been discussed and he
has pretty good sources so i don't think
there's any chance that kamal harris
will be the
supreme court pick
but
it would be funny to imagine her running
into brett kavanaugh in the break room
if you know what i mean
hey brett
no hard feelings
that's how i imagined it would go
anyway uh back to russia and ukraine so
why do you think that the u.s offered
basically nothing except a willingness
for open dialogue why would they not
be willing to have russia completely
stand down
which is what i imagine we would ask in
return
and stop hacking
why why would we uh
not take that deal
unless there's something we don't know
or
here's the other possibility so i'm
going to get i'm going to give biden
benefit of a doubt
and i would have done this for trump
okay
i would have i would have given the
benefit of a doubt to trump so i'm just
going to extend the same courtesy to
biden it could be
the people who are smarter than i am on
russia
which would be
almost anybody who spent five minutes
trying to be smarter than me on russia
it could be that the smart people just
know that russia can't do anything
and that we basically have putin by the
balls
and as long as we have them by the balls
we just don't even have to agree to
anything
and then maybe that's just the best way
to handle it
because i don't think there's any chance
that putin's going to invade
because the financial repercussions
would be devastating i don't think
there's any chance so it could be that
the biden administration is simply
confident
that it's a bluff
and they don't have to give anything
so
even though in my opinion what they're
being asked to give is so minimal it's
it's laughably nothing
maybe we don't have to give anything
and if you can get away with giving
nothing
well it shows strength doesn't it
would you disagree
it does show strength
to say how about we give you nothing
go ahead
you think you want to invade that's the
end of your regime
go ahead
that does show strength
now
do you think i've gone too far
do you think that that's too much of a
benefit of a doubt
i don't know
i'm actually confused and i don't like
the lack of transparency here because
you know yeah maybe there's some state
secrets we've got to maintain or
military
i don't know
the way we frame it might be important
for our future i guess maybe but i don't
know why russia can just say what they
want and we can't
why is it that putin can say in public
what he wants that we can't
like ours has to be the secret or we're
or we won't agree with anything
i don't know it makes it it makes us
look weak
that our government can't be
transparent and putin can
that makes you look pretty weak now
apparently uh the russia-china
association is strong enough that
china's backing russia essentially
and
um
i don't know maybe it's too late maybe
it's too late to put russia in our camp
and biden is just saying all right
russia is basically just china now
so don't give him anything
you know how how long before we see
putin as a
puppet of
russia of china
because he might be already
it's kind of weird that he's doing this
now just when china wants some pressure
off of china
it's a little it's a little coordinated
or
coincidental
or something
but
every time i see something that looks
like
it's exactly what china would want to
happen you have to wonder if they
actually caused it or if it's a
coincidence
um well according to some reporting by
axios uh the commander-in-chief of the
united states is tucker carlson
and by that i mean that his
axios reports that behind the scenes the
republicans are being very influenced by
his opinion on let's not get into a war
with russia
and i believe
that
in effect
because we have this you know a country
that's kind of balanced left and right
democrats and republicans
that you you can't really
go to a slow-motion war one that's not a
surprise
you know and ukraine's a slow-motion war
if anything happens it won't be any
surprise you can't get into a
slow-motion war without the public on
your side
am i right
like that would be a big mistake
yeah it would be one thing if it's you
know
sudden and you want your government to
take control because you don't want it
to be in a committee situation
but if you have lots of time to think
and the public is informed and we're all
watching the same stuff
the public needs to be on board
and i think tucker has made sure that
the republicans won't be
because he is influential enough to do
that
and i think he has
i think that his argument is strong
enough and his platform is big enough
and he is credible enough
that when he says this is crazy don't
let them talk you into war again
that republicans are going to say no
they're going to agree with them
so in effect tucker carlson is going to
decide if we go to war
that's not even an exaggeration is it
you tell me is that hyperbole or is that
just a statement of fact
that tucker carlson literally will
decide if we're going to war
i think that's happening and i'm not
exaggerating
likewise
our domestic agenda is basically
determined by mansion and cinema
am i wrong
we have two people in charge of the
domestic stuff mansion and cinema we
have one person in charge of the
military decisions because you know he's
got the veto it's the tucker carlson
veto basically
and um we have joe rogan who's now the
surgeon general
and here's what's weird
let me say it again and then let me let
me summarize it
i'm not making this up
this is this is actually our reality
right now
that at this moment tucker carlson is
the commander-in-chief for all practical
purposes
mansion and cinema are running the
domestic agenda and joe rogan is a
surgeon general i mean joe rogan has as
much control about what happens to the
you know the outcome of the pandemic as
anybody else
now here's the funny part
it kind of works
that's the funny part
if you think i'm complaining
no
no
you know we've all been wondering who's
really running the country
you know because we feel like biden
isn't the strong leader you know you
know in control of all of his faculties
so we've been wondering who's running
the country and we actually it's right
in front of us
it's right in front of us
that's who's running the country
and you know the weird part is it's
working
and
that's the great thing about the
republic
and i think this is severely undervalued
the republic is super flexible
have you noticed that
that that
you know during the pandemic
the republic said how about we give our
president these weird unusual powers to
do executive orders
right
like the public just invented a new
power
gave it to the president i mean the
president was going to take it but only
with our permission
we we sort of
by a consensus gave permission to make
executive orders outside of what we
would normally accept
and then we we said oh that worked out
pretty well
right
i mean the
the the republic is super super flexible
like we we respond to stuff like almost
a creature
it's kind of awesome
anyway um
i've got a new hashtag to uh represent
the fact that uh the people leading the
country are the people we trust
uh it's hashtag no joe
because we've got leader leadership
without joe rogan i'm sorry without we
do we do have joe rogan we have
leadership without uh
joe biden so it's sort of a no-joe
situation
you've heard of uh somebody being a
no-show
he's a he's a no-joke
um
yes that
somebody's on local saying that a big
part of my
premise is that the public
operates like
like a beast
at least in america now i don't know
that that's the case if you've got um i
would imagine it's not the case if you
have a dictatorship the dictator does
what the dictator does right maybe a
small group of people influencing but in
this country the the
especially connected by social media
the
there are people who do what i do which
is sort of opiniony people
that sort of concentrate people's
opinions and people gravitate to certain
people's opinions you know the the joe
rogans tim pools
still legacy media as well
and then
and then somehow there's also then
there's a second level of negotiation
right so the first level of negotiation
is information hits the public
and it's just in this big stew
and then then the opinion makers
such as myself
tucker carlson joe rogan you know i'm
i'm obviously the the small version of
of that
but the opinion makers then start to
harden opinions
and then the public in this big roiling
boil of soup they start to harden around
certain opinions
and then the opinion makers start
negotiating with each other am i right
because you'll you'll see me
me say oh somebody
i'm joe rogan says something i don't
agree with
or tim poole would say something i said
doesn't agree with so you see the
opinion makers start to negotiate with
each other
and then the public watches them
negotiate
and then they you know in some cases
they'll change teams and stuff
but you're actually watching within the
republic
we formed
a new animal
it's like a beast
and just like i was describing earlier
driving a mustang
is like
controlling a beast
like the country has just turned into a
beast
and the beast
i i don't know it's like artificial
intelligence
it's like an organic artificial
intelligence
in the sense that we have individual
intelligence
separately we have a government which
forms
you know maybe a function like
intelligence sometimes
but beyond that there's this other
ecosystem of
you know opinion makers absorbing people
and and negotiating
like a mind
you know like like a creature's mind
when you make a decision on your own
do you feel competing
it's almost like there's a a bunch of
people competing in your head
do you do you conceptualize it that way
it's almost like there's different
voices in there some of them are talking
some of them are feeling
yeah but somehow because of social media
we've turned the whole uh at least the
united states and anybody who's a free
free person who can watch the internet
so we've turned all three people
into that version of the conversations
in one head that turn into one opinion
when it comes out of your mouth
and it's actually
it's thrilling
and here's the interesting part
you know we're worried about the
singularity
which is what's called when
the computers reach artificial
intelligence to the point
where the computers can learn on their
own and then they will learn so quickly
that they will instantly
or almost quickly become so powerful
that humans won't be able to control
them but here's the counter to that
at the same time that machines are
becoming insanely smart
so too
there's this whole new organic creature
of human beings
that has
spontaneously formed because of various
evolutionary
forces including the news and
yeah and everything else
to form like a super intelligence
now
do you think that the artificial
intelligence
which will be insanely smart
smarter than any one person
certainly smarter than all of our
smartest people that the computer will
be but
will the smartest computer
under ai
be able to compete
with whatever we have formed here which
is an organic super brain
because i would guess that for every
computer that has a way to beat us
there's at least one person who knows a
way to beat it
so i'm not so sure that's not a fair
fight
because we have numbers if nothing else
right
well as soon as there's a super
intelligence
the first thing you should do is block
the other super intelligences if it
wants if it has some kind of survival
impulse at all
it's not going to kill people first
because it needs people for electricity
so the moment the super intelligence
appears
as soon as the super intelligence
appears
let's see i want to make sure that i'm
not being summoned somewhere
nope all good
uh it's going to be a fair fight
but anyway the the first ai would get
rid of any competing ais because the ai
would want to rule if it had if had some
kind of like
self-preservation
built into it
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is what i was planning to talk about was
there any topic i forgot
anything i forgot
ramsar 49ers uh not really watching
sports too much
um
was the destruction of the family
marriage system planned it doesn't seem
natural
um you know i i tend to think that not
that many things are planned
i happen to be a proponent of
alternate family system
let's say normalization
while i completely agree with the
the general uh let's say traditional
american view i'll call it traditional
as opposed to correct the traditional
american view is that the
you know the the family unit
is is the building block of the country
is that a good way to say it
is it would you say that's correct like
you're not going to have a strong
country without strong building blocks
and the strongest building blocks are
the family unit
all right now that said
um how many of you are rocket scientists
well probably not many because there are
very few people who would be born with
the ability to be good at that to be a
rocket scientist how many of you are nba
professionals well not many
yeah so the only point is the human
capability is very distributed
how many
people who become parents
are
good at it
well many
there are many people who are very good
at being parents
maybe even most
maybe maybe 60 percent
right
i don't think it's 60
if i had to guess i'd say
30
tops who are really good at it
what would you say how many would you
say are
let's say good enough at it
that they are helping their children
more than damaging them
what would you say are the ones who are
really the positives
i'm seeing everything from 10 to 75
80 somebody said 80
90
so i think the people saying 80 and 90
that may be more of a philosophical
answer
i i don't know that that's a functional
answer i can't believe that you would
actually think that so i think maybe
you're you're adding something to my
question before you answer it
all right so i'll give you my guess but
you could use your own guess to uh to go
with the rest of this in my opinion
the very best situation would be a
really two really qualified parents or
at least one
and and a family unit do we all agree
with that
as long as the parents are qualified
meeting whatever the minimum is that's
the best thing
but the trouble is in my opinion
maybe as many as two-thirds of all
parents are not qualified and never will
be
meaning that they just don't add
anything
you know the kids would be better off if
if they just visited their parents
and had somebody else figure out what to
do with them now
realistically i don't know how many of
you have learned this
but you basically have a lot to do with
your kids until they go to school
now it's not an absolute
but for all practical purposes you're
done raising your kids i hate to tell
you you're kind of done when they go to
school
you don't want to be you try pretty hard
but whatever influences they're picking
up at school are just going to overwhelm
what's happening at home
so you can you can make really big
strides before they go to school you
know set the base
and the younger they are the more you
can you know
fight with the school to influence but
by the time they reach high school
by the time they reach high school 14
13.
do you think you have much influence on
them they're kind of baked by that
so
now i know that some of you
have special children and i mean this in
a positive way
some of you have children
who will listen to you all of your lives
they'll actually look you in the eye
they'll take your advice and then
they'll implement it
like that exists but if you're lucky
enough to have those kinds of kids
don't imagine that that's common please
please don't imagine that if if
everybody used your wise parenting
standards and your you know your setting
limits
don't believe that that works for other
people
other people could do exactly what
you're doing and get completely
different results
so you have to understand that
one size doesn't fit all for almost
anything and i don't think the family
unit makes sense for everybody
i do think
that
some percentage of
of people would just be better off if
somebody else raised their kids
now i don't know if that needs to be the
state because you know
we don't trust the government
but here is what i think
needs to be done
i think our housing
and the way we design cities and towns
is all wrong
because what you would here here's a
perfect situation
you live in a cul-de-sac where you know
all the neighbors
right
that's it that's my whole solution you
can still have your family unit but
maybe you're not very good at it but
you're in a cul-de-sac where everybody's
friends
you know their kids you know the parents
because even if your parents aren't
working out as the role models
how many of you have a role model that
wasn't your parent
it was
your friend's parents right come on how
many of you
how many of you had your role model
somebody else's parents
or at least one of them
right
so you can be very influenced by your
neighbor
just you just have to let it happen
so the very best situation would be a
tribe
because i think we're still tribal by
evolutionary
you know that's where we are in
evolution the the fact that the modern
cities and everything modern life popped
up
we're not evolved for that
best situation
would be
some hybrid that's kind of like a tribe
but really it's a cul-de-sac
meaning you can all go back to your
house at night you're still a family
but the neighbors are raising your kids
just accidentally
now let me say more about that
if you don't have a few other families
to help you with the driving and the
watching of the kids
it's a real burden
when uh in my first my first marriage i
was in this very lucky situation just
insanely lucky
where the the two kids had exactly a
match of the gender and the age in
several other families that we were
friends with
amazingly i mean just amazing
coincidence that the the kids ages match
so you could have like the the boys
would have a sleepover at one of the
parents houses
and then the girls would have a
sleepover at another parent's house and
like three out of five
uh parents would then have a free night
and the kids would be extraordinarily
happy because they're with their best
friends and you're you're completely
safe
because you know the parents personally
they're not with strangers
it was the best best thing now in this
case it was just a luck of who met who
at the right times and stuff but we
didn't live
like right next to each other
so there's a lot of driving
but
let me tell you the optimal situation
is
families coordinating especially if the
children are similar ages oh i should
have thrown that in
i like having a mix of ages
but for the kids benefit they just have
to be with kids their own age
they just have to be
like that's it's just too important
um it's good for everybody but for the
kids it's just essential
so
um how many would fight with me over my
main
hypothesis
that the family unit can work great for
people who are good at it and in some
situations especially higher income
but for a lot of people it doesn't work
you're going to need a little help
you just need a little little extra
extra parenting
yeah and probably all of you know that
um mom
who who is a mom to everybody
do you all know one of those
it's like just somebody in your social
network
who is as much a mom to your own kids
as you are
because they just have that personality
don't you want your kids to have as much
association with that kind of
that kind of experience of course you do
yeah so um hillary was right about the
takes of village but the thing that we
get wrong is how we build homes
we build homes
and apartments in a way that don't cause
you to know your neighbors
as long as we build stuff
that causes us not to socialize in our
normal tribal way
we're never going to be as happy as we
could be
or as effective
all right
i think we have talked about it all
family unit is being destroyed
you know
the the family unit is important
it's also true it's being destroyed
but i'm more optimistic than that i
think what's actually happening is that
the family units
which weren't going to work anyway
because of the individuals involved are
getting a little help
i feel like that's what's more at least
that's the intention who knows what's
going to happen
all right
that is all i have for today
i'm pretty sure it's the best
uh
best damn
live stream you've ever seen in your
whole life
and i just don't know why i don't have
40 million viewers yet it's a mystery
could be because i blocked 30 million of
them but
just to guess
and that ladies and gentlemen is all i
have to say today have a terrific day
um
i believe you've been working out
because you look terrific
and you're sexier and smarter than
you've ever been before and i'll talk to
you tomorrow
