and here are my tells for cognitive
dissonance
number one if somebody changes the topic
their their experience in cognitive
dissonance now I was asked for a
clarification on this one
because lots of times people will be
trying to make a point and it's not
getting through
and then it was pointed out to me
sometimes people will say all right let
me take a different approach
I'm not talking about a different
approach
because that's the same topic
here's what I'm talking about oh yeah
your opinion about whatever uh
I judge that based on your opinion on
this different topic
okay that's cognitive distance right if
you have to change the whole topic it's
because you you have to bow out you
didn't have anything uh ad hominem this
is when you just insult people
so I get this one a lot
if I've won an argument the next thing I
hear is an insult to me personally
is pretty consistent so ad hominem means
you want
changing the topic means you want
you can just say okay I'll take Victory
I'm done
mind reading
I like to think this is one of my
greatest contributions to civilization
now I'm sure I'm not the first person to
make this observation that people
imagine they know what you're thinking
but I'm trying to popularize it and give
it a name so that when we talk about it
you know we're talking about the same
thing so how many times have you seen me
in a debate online and then somebody
will say well obviously you believed
that scientists are reliable
that's mind reading and incorrect mind
reading because I don't believe
scientists are reliable in fact science
is the most unreliable of all things do
you know why
why is science the most unreliable
field
because if everything works correctly
you're wrong most of the time
if everything's working smoothly you're
wrong most of the time and then a few
things will pass you know through the
peer review it'll get published peer
review you'll be able to duplicate it
you know maybe you don't have a
randomized controlled trial yet but you
get one that you get another one right
so you're you're crawling through
uncertainty and largely wrong stuff
until you get something closer to truth
so science is mostly about being wrong
and then every now and then something
awesome happens a great process that you
know but mostly wrong
so mind reading about uh what is true in
the person's mind is always a tell and
when I see this I say thank you and I'm
done word salad is a little harder to
identify
because it really looks like it might
make sense but maybe you're not getting
the point
the word salad is often related to a
change of Topic in other words the word
salad often brings in other topics and
mixes them together and puts them in
sentences where the sentence appears to
make sense from a grammar perspective
but when you look at it as a whole it's
not really saying anything
so you recognize the word solid when you
see it
um
this would be harder to explain using an
analogy instead of a reason
analogies are fine if the only way
you're using them is to explain A New
Concept
that's a good use of an analogy but if
you use it instead of a reason as in in
this case we did it this way so in this
unrelated case which I'm reminded of we
should do it the same way
that's using it as a reason
that's the wrong way to reuse it that's
usually a tell for cognitive distance
because you don't need an analogy if you
have a reason
here would be here would be an example
of somebody who has a reason hey why
should I not do this thing oh because
it's very risky because this could break
it's unreliable and if that breaks
you'll be injured
that's somebody who understands the
situation
here's somebody who doesn't understand
why you shouldn't do that thing all
right all right suppose you were on a
ship and the ship captain told you not
to lean over the rail okay as soon as
you hear that
you know that they don't have a reason
they're using an analogy to try to try
to make you not notice there's no reason
s are easy oh don't do that because it's
dangerous
simple
oh it's very much like a spaceship if
you were designing a spaceship you'd
make sure that the O-rings no no as soon
as you go that direction it means you
don't know your own argument
all right
here's a new one
insisted it's complicated and cannot be
summarized
foreign
so if you've seen this lately it's
complicated it just can't be summarized
do you know what can't be summarized
cognitive dissonance everything else
could be summarized right even if even
if the summary doesn't tell you much
right so there's nothing I can't
summarize
it's easy to summarize
summarizing is the easiest thing in the
world
the only thing you can't summarize is
something you don't understand yourself
or it doesn't doesn't fit your point
Barnes says I don't know about that all
right and then my favorite is the sotel
where somebody starts a sentence with
the word so
what usually follows the word so in a
debate
is them characterizing your your opinion
incorrectly yeah the Kathy Newman thing
so and usually the the characterization
has an absurd absolute
so here's what it would look like in the
wild
so you're saying that every person who
got coveted
had no long covet
or so you're saying that everybody who
got the vaccination made the wrong
decision everybody everybody
or so you're saying that everybody who
went to Harvard is a liberal idiot like
everyone every person who ever went to
Harvard is a liberal idiot that's what
you're saying right so whenever you see
the so look for a mischaracterization of
your opinion now why does somebody need
to mischaracterize your opinion
it's because they're in cognitive
dissonance they they've lost they've
lost the argument and they know it on
some level and so they're they're just
creating nonsense in their minds yeah so
this ladies and gentlemen is the
greatest contribution to the world since
E equals m c squared
if you understand this
and you start to put this filter on your
interactions your stress level will
disappear
because once you see somebody exhibit
one of the seven tells
and by the way making it the seven tells
makes it more powerful persuasion did
you catch that well you give something a
name and you label it
it becomes real in people's minds
because until it has a name they can't
hang it they can't store it it's hard to
store a concept but we wrap a name
around it the seven tells for cognitive
dissonance imagine if you said to
somebody oh that is a tell for cognitive
dissonance
it means nothing right just compare
these two things oh that thing you did
that's a tell for cognitive dissonance
really is it I don't think so
now that compare that to oh that's one
of the seven
that's number three on the seven tells
for cognitive dissonance now how does
that feel
completely different doesn't it just
because there's seven
makes you think oh my God that's a real
thing there's seven of them it must be
like everybody knows the seven tells for
cognitive distance but I don't oh no I
better figure out what that means
completely different persuasion just by
saying it's one of the seven tells
seven cognitive sins
[Music]
I like tell us better
but I like where you're going with that
right now I'm going to say it again
without any hyperbole whatsoever
this is one of the greatest things that
Humanity has ever experienced
if you understand these seven tells the
whole world looks different and all the
people that you think are just
annoyingly not getting your argument you
can just say oh I won the argument
already
you did this one oh I won the argument
you did that and just walk away
yeah we all we all have our blind spots
so if you're looking for my blind spots
look in the same place
right use this standard to evaluate me
and you will absolutely
sooner or later you'll find me
experiencing cognitive distance
all right
