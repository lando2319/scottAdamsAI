to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and some
of that's going to happen some coffee
with Scott Adams and if you'd like to
take it up to a level that no one has
ever seen before I'm talking about
stratospheric levels all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chalice
or Stein again teen joke or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here today the
thing makes everything better
here it comes the simultaneousip go
yeah that's good
um all right I have to I have to start
with this you know the world economic
forum is going on
and people are worried that you know
they're gonna take control of our minds
and turn us all into sheep
uh I'm not making this up
this is the actual outfit that Kirsten's
Cinema was wearing a at the world
economic forum she has actually dressed
like a sheep
[Laughter]
now
you could tell me that this doesn't look
like a sheep but you're wrong it looks
like she dressed like a sheep
this is the funniest thing I've seen all
year that's an early year
oh that is so funny now
this is part of my theme
that you can't really tell that you
can't tell who's kidding anymore
like it's impossible to tell the
difference between things that are
really happening and things that are
just a joke
let me give you another example
Rob Reiner
it wasn't long ago that I imagined that
you know actor director Rob Reiner was a
political person who used to be an
entertainment
uh I used to think well he was an
entertainment primarily but then he
crossed over into politics and I thought
oh well he doesn't seem to be doing so
good in politics
but uh they'll be he tweeted this today
he's had a good week he Trends on
Twitter almost every day uh he says
there is no amount of propaganda you can
spew on Twitter that convinces Americans
that Joe Biden
what hold on uh
oh I don't even have his quote here this
is somebody else making fun of him but
uh Rob Riders is going on on Twitter
about how honest Joe Biden is compared
to this criminal uh Trump and it's
gotten to the point where
I think he's actually crossed the
blood-brain barrier
from an Entertainer talking about
politics
to just an Entertainer
he's crossed back he is just
entertaining at this point you cannot
convince me that he doesn't know what
he's doing at this point now I think in
the beginning he was just a you know
crazy Democrat saying what Democrats say
but I think he got so much attention
for being a little bit you know further
than
maybe the news would allow
that I think he's I think he's just
embracing it now it looks like this is
my honest opinion on this is not a
criticism this is my honest opinion I
think he knows it's for entertainment
now
I think he crossed back into the
entertainment mode and now I love it
now I love it so the last few days I've
been reading his tweets and I'm just
fully entertained because of what he's
doing to mostly you know Trump
supporters well watching him troll the
Trump supporters is actually kind of fun
I stopped taking him seriously as a you
know some kind of a
political pundit
uh but what he's what he's just solidly
in the entertainment domain he's really
good at that
he's really good at entertainment he has
a long track record of being excellent
at it I think he's doing it again
so I went from being mildly annoyed at
his opinions to being totally
entertained by the show he's putting on
there there's no way he doesn't know
what he's doing at this point
I mean you would have to assume he has
an IQ of like 90 to not know what he's
doing at this point right you know in
the beginning I think it was more
organic but now he's just having fun I
think that's my honest opinion
well uh I have a
I don't know if this is a recommendation
or not because it's creepy but Hulu has
a series in which they're talking about
the Dark Side of Hugh Hefner and the
Playboy Empire has anybody seen that I
just started watching it and I'll tell
you what um
really mostly I'm noticing by it
the first thing is yes there are some
things maybe you didn't know but nothing
that would surprise you
in other words yeah maybe some details
you know for example
you didn't know that uh half or half's
valet
one of the jobs of the valet was they
had a bucket that was just for picking
up his used dildos off the floor
apparently there were always so many of
them
like they had a they had like a dildo
bucket they had a whole process where
somebody would
sterilize the the dildos every night and
then put them back in the bed stand with
his other sex toys
so there's all these creepy little
details that we're hearing now all of
the sex stuff
all of it even even stuff that was a
little not even a little but pretty
eye-raising
it all sounded like exactly Within
half's you know philosophy of anything
goes if it's legal and nobody gets hurt
so you know I don't judge any of the sex
stuff that's for you to judge
but here's what I was thinking about
taken by
uh the the source of the information is
mostly the women
and the women entered a
a business model in which apparently
they were made to compete for the the
top prize of being Playmate of the Year
and everybody assumed that they had to
sleep with Hefner to get there
so that so he had created this Empire
where everybody just assumed they needed
to sleep with him
to get more money
and
I believe at no time did he ever say
that there's no evidence that he ever
said you know
the only way you get to be Playmate of
the Year
you got to come up to the bedroom
now
but a lot of people everybody understood
it right it was implied
yet yet there were examples of people
who became Playmate of the Year who
never had any personal relationship to
him
so he certainly had an alibi which is
well it's not true I never asked anybody
to and several people who never were
with me were Playmates leader
that that's like the theme I see all the
way through it is that the women believe
that he hypnotized them
and brainwashed them
and remove their free will
and they said because he was you know he
was smooth and he was rich and he was he
was much older and they were like 19 20
and he was you know 50 at one point
and so when you put it all together
the the poor women who were involved
were just victims
of this horrible monster and they called
them a monster
now here's my problem
there's no indication that any of the
women were surprised by any of it
meaning that you know everything that
was presented as something that they
should do or could do or whatever
it was always presented well before they
had to do it
like they they all had you know nobody
nobody held their arms and said stay in
this room
and so it's a it's a really interesting
question about where free will
which is an illusion
uh where let's say we're a personal
agency
um matters and where this real
brainwashing thing actually is a thing
and I'm just fascinated because there
there's a larger theme that's never
really spoken
which is that women are not responsible
for their own actions
but men are
and that's that's through it all nobody
says that that that's just the
impression you get that all of the women
involved and there are lots of them who
were all victims
they were all victims but they all also
knew exactly what they were getting into
so they they voluntarily got into it
but then they became victims
and yet nobody held them down and nobody
nobody ever threatened them I believe
there's no evidence of a threat
it's just fascinating so I'm not even
sure I'm taking a side right because
it's not my business and who knows
what's true and you know half of his dad
because we can't defend himself but I'm
not going to defend half right so that's
not my job he had a pretty complicated
life and you'd also be judging it by
today's lens and you know that that's
weird so yeah I mean you could judge him
that's fine uh
but the the creepy thing is that women
don't seem to have a sense of Their Own
free will or agency The Way Way men seem
to if you would reversed all of this and
just change the genders
who said all right there was a woman who
started a woman's magazine of naked men
and she invited lots of naked men over
to her mansion and and they thought
those naked men
thought that if they had sex with her
which she really encouraged that they
would get promotions and they would get
like more money and stuff
would that even be a story no
because we would assume that all the men
at any age even 18 years old you would
assume that the men made their own
choices
nobody held him down nobody put a gun to
their head
they simply entered a system that had
that incentive you know to fight for the
top spot and usually in a sexual way
it has the story has everything in it
about human nature and how we treat men
and women
uh so if you can get past the fact that
the details of the story
are sort of uncomfortable because it's
sort of uncomfortable all the way
through I haven't seen it at all but I
can tell it's going to be
it's really interesting so I recommend
it I recommend it without necessarily
saying you would be entertained by the
details
it's just so interesting how it's framed
in the larger sense
all right too much on that
there's a bar owner in New York City you
CNN reports uh who's opening a sober bar
silver bar so no drinking no drink
served and apparently demand is high
does that seem like a great idea
kind of does
doesn't it well you know maybe not a
great idea that you would go to it but
do you think in terms of a business
model is a great idea
I think it is
I think it is a great idea because the
people who don't drink and apparently
there's a really big Trend going on
toward people stopping drinking did you
know that
that that's like a big Trend that's
happening right now a lot of individuals
giving up drinking I think there's
probably more alcoholics because because
addiction is a different story but the
people who are not quite alcoholics but
just are drinkers a whole bunch of
people give I think maybe 20 percent
you know
non-alcoholic drinks are way up which is
telling you something
so I think it's a good idea the people
who don't drink don't really have places
to go that they would meet somebody
does that make sense to me
um Tucker Carlson has a great conspiracy
theory that I don't think is true
but I love the fact that he put it out
there
because it's entertaining and you know I
think is presented in the right spirit
it's not a claim of truth it's a claim
of two things that happened about the
same time and you have to ask yourself
is that a coincidence and the two things
that happened were you all know that the
the flights in the USA were grounded and
it took a while to fix it
but at the same time the price of
Bitcoin went up substantially
as if somebody bought a bunch of it like
a government
like they had to buy Bitcoin
to pay a ransom
like the problem with our with the
flight systems might have been a hacker
who said Give me X millions of dollars
or billions and all are released the
code or something
now I don't think that's what happened
but I love it as a conspiracy theory
very exciting conspiracy theory probably
not all right I got a little bit more
information from a good source who will
remain nameless on White House visitor
logs
and also uh president's residence logs
of visitors
now I told you that the White House had
under Trump had removed the visitor logs
but I am completely convinced based on
my own experience as well that at the
very least they run your driver's
license and social security number and
do a background check
would everybody agree that at the very
because I'm sure I gave them that
information before I went to the White
House pretty sure I did
but it wasn't in my case in my case
there was no background check that I'm
aware of
you know I don't think any family
members were interviewed or anything
like that now that could be because I'm
a public figure
you know I'm pretty well-known entity I
guess
but somebody on Twitter said that they
visited White House a non-public figure
and says that their family was contacted
which is good work I guess so I guess
you'd say good work Secret Service you
know and if they didn't check my
background
but they did check some you know lesser
known person's background that would
make sense I mean I would completely
understand that
um but here's what I'm starting to
believe might be true under the Trump
White House there must have been two
lists
one list that the Secret Service of
course would check everybody and write
down who came in when
I do believe that they would do that
don't you
clearly there has to be a list I also
believe based on information I just got
from somebody who actually knows that
that they would do the same thing at the
president's residence
while he's in office
and maybe even afterwards if he's still
a secret service protection
so I believe that probably the Trump
White House always had a list
even when they said we got rid of the
the visitors list they still had a list
it's just it was the Secret Service list
maybe not where somebody signs a log as
they enter or something like that so I'm
thinking there was more like a a
publicly lit public list that the Press
could ask for
but also a secret service list that
nobody can see
question
do you think we should ever have access
to the secret Services list of who
visited the president I say no
what do you say nope nope nope nope
do not want that
that is not good for the country
not good for the country
you don't want your president being
constrained on who he can talk to
that that's pretty important
or how often he talks to somebody he or
she
yeah it's the same thing about when
somebody goes and has a private
conversation with the president
they generally don't talk about it
do you know why
because then the president won't be able
to talk to anybody if every time
somebody talks to the president they go
blab about it then the president will
never have an honest conversation with
anybody
so I have to admit one of the um
the best standards of behavior
that Americans do voluntarily as far as
I can tell is they really don't talk
about what they talked about with the
president
wouldn't you agree
well I've never even seen it like I've
done it I've actually told you what I
talked about with Trump but only the
things that make him look good and you
know they're sort of obvious things so
you know I wouldn't talk about anything
that I thought was even a little bit
even a little bit
you know interesting or gray area or
anything like that I'll only tell you
the obvious stuff like I told you for
example
that Trump told me their private
conversation that he thought Biden would
be his challenge in 2020. because it
makes it makes Trump look smart right
and you know there's no harm right so I
told you that
but you know and you know it's not like
he and I talked about any state Secrets
or anything but if we had
I wouldn't tell you
right but I love the fact that nobody
does
it seems as if nobody would do that I've
never seen it have you am I missing
something I've never seen anybody say I
talked to the president and he told me
this secret and I'm going to tell you
Omarosa I don't know
yeah yeah I mean it would be bad for the
person who told the secret but uh I
still think people do it for a larger
sense
that you just shouldn't do it
oh Comey
John Bolton all right somebody's giving
me some examples I'll accept your
examples without looking into them
all right so I do think that there would
be a log of Biden's visitors in as much
as I think it's important
I don't think the public should know but
maybe maybe some
you know Intel people can look into it
um
question on the Epstein Client List
where we keep saying
why don't we know where the Epstein
Client List is here's my problem with
that why do you think there's a list
what would be the thinking behind
Epstein keeping an actual list of his
clients
now let's not hold on hold on
blackmail isn't is not an answer to the
question I'll tell you why in a minute
now hold on hold on let me let me set
this up better I'm going to set this up
better stop answering get wait for the
setup and then give me your answer
is is my contention
that you those of you who think Epstein
had a list of his clients
are not good Evil Geniuses
now
I don't want to brag
but I feel like I can get into the head
of an evil genius
and figure out what I would have done
if I were Epstein do you think I would
have kept in one place a list of all the
naughty naughty sex clients
do you think I would have kept the list
in one place like one list of all my
naughty clients let me tell you who
Epstein was a genius
in the area of finances
he was a genius in the area of finances
and you think he didn't understand
diversification
or risk
risk mitigation
of course he did
the last thing in the world he would do
is put all put all that in one place
you would never put it in one place
here's why let's say somebody finds it
if somebody finds your entire Client
List
first they kill you
and then they take that and they sell it
to the biggest the highest bidder
or they use it themselves to to
Blackmail those people and Run the World
if I found Epstein's Client List it was
like a real you know sex Secret
power broker kind of thing I would use
it to run the world or sell it I mean
assuming I'm a bad person
right if if it let's say the
intelligence agencies of the United
States
got a hold of the list
would they release it
only if they're idiots no because it
would have people from other countries
on it and they would use that knowledge
to control the people in the other
countries of course
of course
now if you're Epstein
and you want to stay in business with
your little uh blackmailing operation
wouldn't it make more sense
to create a situation where if somebody
found let's say one or two evidences of
your blackmail that that's all they
would find
and they wouldn't know about the other
ones because then you could still be in
business
so all of you who say he had a master
list to Blackmail you're not
understanding how blackmail works
don't you want to not get caught
I think not getting caught is like
really Central to blackmailing
if you blackmail get caught the whole
thing didn't make sense
so the getting away with it is very
important to the blackmail
and the getting away with it means you
don't put all of your assets in one
place so somebody could find your master
list nobody would do that nobody would
do that
now what you might do is you and Elaine
might have the list in your head
but you almost you also might have a
video
here's what I think they have I think
they have video
that that in some cases are probably
blackmail material
it might be in different places and it
might be in one place but it wouldn't be
a Client List
you know there might be a password
to a Dropbox
and that's it
and if uh if Maxwell and Epstein don't
give you the password to the Dropbox or
wherever it is you would never find it
it would be totally unfindable
so there's probably somewhere in the
world a bunch of video and it's just a
password and it's all it would take to
get in there
but you'll never hear it
or maybe the FBI already has it and
they're using to Blackmail other
countries but I will give you one
possibility to explain everything the
Epstein list was found by somebody
somebody found it or let's say the
folder with the the videos and they sold
it to China
because why would why would you sell it
to China of all of all places why China
now I didn't say there's a list of
videos I said there might be a file
somewhere in which they are which should
be different on the list
that'd be the highest bidder China would
be the highest bidder of course you'd
sell it to them do you think there's a
chance they wouldn't want to buy it
do you think you could present it to him
then and they say yeah no no thanks not
interested no of course they would buy
it of course they would and they would
pay
a lot if it's good stuff
so if somebody found it and if they sold
it to the highest bidder and if it were
China would that explain why Congress
isn't acting on Tick Tock and Fentanyl
yes it would
yes it would
it would explain
everything
it would explain everything not that I
think it happened I'm not I'm not
suggesting it happened it's just that
The Conspiracy Theory explains
everything and the current situation
does not because it's still a mystery
why Congress totally agrees what to do
on Tick Tock for example to ban it yet
it's not happening
you can't explain why everybody's in
agreement and it's important
and it's good for China
bad for us and nothing's happening right
there's clearly money somewhere that's
causing this to be the case somewhere we
just don't know exactly where
all right
um
I
I dared to enter the uh the Democrat
bubble this morning just to see what's
over there
ah it's a scary freaking thing and I
know it's got to be just as scary the
other way when people on the left who
have never been exposed to you know the
the right-leading social media if they
wander over they're going to see things
they've never seen before and they'll be
like what that's crazy uh in some cases
it is but sometimes it's true and
they've just never seen it so here are
some things I learned by reading Rolling
Stone a completely different reality
uh and it's just mind-boggling because
this is the brainwashing that the left
is getting
I know what brainwashing the right gets
because I see it all the time but I
don't really see it directly until until
I made a case of it so
compare this to what you think is true
all right just to hold in your mind what
you believe is true
and then I'm going to tell you what
Democrats are reading is true
this is from Rolling Stone
the so-called quote lab League theory
has never been substantiated there is no
evidence that the virus had been in a
laboratory prior to the start of the
pandemic and peer-reviewed scientific
papers have put forth overwhelming
evidence
with a link so there's a link to the
overwhelming evidence that the pathogen
likely leapt from animals to humans
does that does that match your
understanding
the
correct me if I'm wrong but the right
believes that the laboratory leak is
almost positively guaranteed but not
quite
whereas the animal to animal theory is
debunked right
now I don't know which one's true I'm
just saying that the left and right have
different movies of what's going on
right
so then I was trying to reconcile how do
you reconcile
that is overwhelming evidence that did
not come from a lab
at the same time that the right
overwhelmingly thinks it probably did
and he reconciled that well I looked at
their link because naturally I thought
to myself
overwhelming evidence well I'm going to
click on that and see where all this
overwhelming evidence goes
now let me ask you this
do you think when I clicked on the link
that literally says overwhelming
evidence
that I saw overwhelming evidence
nope do you know what do you know what I
found
uh there is no real evidence of either
the lab leak or the animal to animal
spread
there's actually no evidence for either
one of them
but that's called overwhelming evidence
that it came from animals
no
no
the actual link does not say there's a
robot it just says we don't know
completely different than what so if you
were a Democrat
you probably wouldn't click the link
I would just say well overwhelming
evidence is pretty clear I don't need to
see how overwhelming it is no need to
check it myself I'll just go with
overwhelming evidence
so they believe uh but here's the funny
part
and I swear to God this is you know true
to my theme for today's live stream
you can't even tell if this is a parody
you're just gonna laugh when I tell you
this
according to Rolling Stone
whether it came from a lab or it came
from an animal
no matter which way it came
is still humans faults
Still Human fault if it came from an
animal infecting animal do you know why
that is human's fault
let's take a guess
yeah not exactly climate change but the
impact we've had on the environment yes
the human impact on the environment
caused the uh the pangolins to a
bat
and there we are
so the important thing the important
thing is it's humans fault
according to Rolling Stone that's the
important Point whichever way it goes we
don't know which way it goes we've got
overwhelming evidence
overwhelming evidence that is because
humans did bad things to the environment
oh how convenient that is how very
convenient
now
I see you literally laughing
do you remember when I first told you
that uh the reason you don't see TV and
movie comedies anymore or at least not
many of them is that it's hard to write
comedy because reality is now hilarious
you can't can't compete with just the
news
this is hilarious that no matter what
happened to humans faults even if a
Pangolin banged a bat it's like well
that's a little bit on you isn't it
a little bit on you
here's another one also from Rolling
Stone
um
I I'm just I just have to read this to
you all right like I was going to
paraphrase it but you just have to hear
the actual words from Rolling Stone
about Eric swalwell and his ties to a
Chinese spy
now
is it your understanding that he had sex
with that Chinese spy
is that your understanding
allegedly yeah all right well not
according to the Rolling Stone
here's what Rolling Stone says and watch
what's left out
see a few of these things left out of
the story according to your version
almost a decade ago the FBI informed the
California Democrat swallow that one of
his campaign volunteers was working for
Chinese intelligence
swalwell cooperated with the FBA and you
know that's the important thing
it's a cooperation to remove the spy
from the country and privately informed
them Speaker Boehner and the
intelligence chair Devon Nunes of his
efforts that was the end of it
that was the end of it yeah there was a
spy just working on his campaign
and uh what do you as soon as he was
told about it he acted promptly and took
care of it got around the country
uh
it's like they left it out the
alleged affair
is the affair
did the people on the right just make
that up
I don't know if you can say yes
but is there is there any evidence that
they had an affair
I mean that's what everybody in the
right says I I've literally never seen a
news report on it I just hear people
talk about it
it's unknown
well I would think that that would be a
big point or at least
and now they say that McCarthy is
repeating those claims as rationale for
moving them from the the Intel committee
um and I'm thinking to myself
no I think I think it was the alleged
sleeping with her
that got him removed
I don't know that he was removed because
as soon as he found out there was a spy
in his campaign he acted quickly to get
rid of her
let now I guess the only thing I can say
about this is are you Blown Away
how different the news is on the left
and the right it's just not even the
same world
and honestly I don't know which one is
true in this case
because I've never seen proof
that Eric's wall well slept with the
Chinese spy have you
and I'm going to be consistent you know
I'm not I'm not a big supporter of
swallow
but I'm going to be consistent
innocent until proven guilty
innocent until proven guilty
I don't know maybe it never happened I'm
willing to believe it never happened
it's the sort of thing people make up
um
so I saw a great tweet today that I
boosted the Twitter account is Joe's
Roman HOA and Colt
I don't even know what that means this
is funny Twitter handle but uh this
account was suggested Joe Rogan should
host the next uh World economic forum
and make all the rich people do the
things they suggest
Fear Factor Style
make Klaus bike bike to work in
Southeast Asia
and I thought that would be the best
reality show ever
take take a bunch of rich people like
literally
and build a like a a walled off island
or you know place where they're not
connected to a civilization and make
them live
the way they like us to live you know
allegedly no privacy no ownership eating
bugs
you know don't use oil and then see what
you can do
see how it goes
take all this stuff yeah now I don't
believe all of the the rumors about the
wef like I I I'm not all the way
conspiracy with that in terms of you
know taking away all your material
possessions I don't think that's real
but it would be hilarious to see a uh a
show in which they they showed the end
point of uh if they got everything they
wanted
um
you see did you see the Elon Musk of
course is dumping on the WF and uh I got
pulled into that story because of some
tweets on the same topic
so uh
once again the thing I tell you keeps
happening
why am I in the middle of all these
stories
like I get that I talk about them but
everybody talks about them
everybody talks about them but somehow
I'm like in the middle of a story
now
so I guess that's something I'm doing
but uh Elon Musk asked this
you said why is Davos even a thing and
he uh compared the annual meaning of the
global Elites online to uh the fortune
Forum because he asked if you made it if
you made a list like do a contest make a
list of the things that world economic
Forum says and then make a list of
things that 4chan says and see if people
could tell the difference if he didn't
label who said what now I think he could
but it's a funny comment it's a funny
comment
all right
but here's the my favorite part about
the world economic Forum
I wanted to see what they've
accomplished
it turns out they've accomplished quite
a bit quite a bit and I'd like to share
with you all of their accomplishments so
far because many of you think
they haven't done anything at all right
well what have they done except you know
get us all scared about the future
but they've actually accomplished things
and so I there were 10 major
accomplishments
and uh I thought I'd share them with you
uh for example all right these are just
examples these are some of the things
they accomplished for example they
watched some Norwegians create a fund
and then they took credit for the work
of members they mobilized some
coalitions they bragged about the work
of signatories uh they teamed with
others they signed a compact to develop
a framework which will allow the
measurement of a long-term approach and
they agreed to six principles and
endorsed the plan
so
that's all pretty important
all that mobilizing of coalitions and
signatories and and Frameworks and
measurements and principles and plans
uh
does this sound like a Dilbert comic to
you or is it just me
I could take this exactly and turn it
into a Sunday deliver comic and I
wouldn't have to change the words
this could be Wally's performance report
right
uh Wally what did you uh accomplish well
I watched another organization create a
fund I took work for some of the other
members because I was on a team we
mobilized some coalitions and many of
the signatories
um had some accomplishments which I'm
claiming credit for for also being a
signatory uh we teamed we teamed we
signed some compacts I created a
framework of the measurement of our
long-term approach and we agreed on six
principles and endorsed the plan
you tell me that that's not a Dilbert
performance review joke all by itself I
will prove it to you by turning it into
a cartoon
this afternoon I will turn these exact
words
into a Delbert account
let's just find out if anybody
recognizes it
all right
so literally the things that they uh
claim
seem to be there are people who attended
who did something awesome
and we agree with it
where they announced it here
so we get some credit for it
but to me it looks like a whole bunch of
people doing things they might have
wanted to do anyway
and the WF is taking credit for what
members are doing
now where is all this stuff about eating
bugs and taking away your property
they've got 10 10 accomplishments but
none of them seem to go to
take away your stuff and you eat bugs so
I guess they keep that on the down low
or maybe it's not real
maybe none of us real
I don't think I don't believe any of the
stuff you're worried about is real
uh
but maybe you'd be more comfortable if
they worried about it more I think
yeah there's lots of stuff that they
talk about which I think is just
interesting and you know a way things
could go and
who knows
yeah it's it
so I'm a pescetarian an uncomfortable
pescetarian meaning I'll eat fish if it
doesn't have a hat on it but I hate it
like I hate I hate eating fish but I do
it because I can and I need the protein
but if nobody had ever eat animals and
so you know let's say you were born a
vegetarian you'd never heard of anybody
eating an animal and somebody came to
you and said now we're going to eat cows
you're like what
I've only ever eaten vegetables what do
you talk about yeah we're gonna eat cows
now and you'd never heard of it like no
humid at every in the cow
it would sound exactly like eating bugs
it might sound worse right so when
people say uh we'll never eat bugs I say
really
really
I think you might
if they make those bugs taste good yeah
you might you might I don't know I mean
you can talk people into anything when
it comes to food apparently
all right
um
let's see
so we got a new important study
that determined that the people who
exercise regularly
had lower rates of hospitalization and
death from covet
so the people who were regular
exercisers did much better if they got
covered
who would have ever seen that coming
you know the implications of this are
shocking
think about this the implications this
is suggesting that people who are in
good health
are less likely to be hospitalized and
die
that is shocking did you know that did
you know the healthy people are less
likely to die than unhealthy people I
mean I
it's a good thing we read the news
I I thought healthy people were dying
first I didn't know but apparently the
healthy people live longer
huh
what's the first thing I told you when
the pandemic happened
get your vitamin D and exercise
told you every day for weeks get your
vitamin D and exercise
turned out it was the best thing you
could have done
you're welcome yeah and lose weight
you're welcome
so I guess I nailed that
[Applause]
um
here's an argument
so I say I save the stuff you don't want
to hear so everybody who doesn't want to
hear an argument that you haven't heard
before this is one I don't think you've
heard before
but it has to do with vaccinations in
covid so if you want to take off now
I won't be mad I'm gonna go private by
the way keep forgetting to do it
going private on locals so
here's an argument by James Sur awakey
he's the author of wisdom of crowds
and he wrote the financial page for the
New Yorker right so if he wrote the
financial page for the New Yorker and he
wrote a best-selling book
he knows he knows economics and
knows how to analyze things and he'd be
a rational person
so he printed a graph on Twitter
does anybody believe a covid related
graph on Twitter
you should not right
so no it doesn't matter what it says
it's not credible there's nothing about
the nothing's credible but but here's an
argument you've never seen so I'm only
presenting this as an argument I don't
think you've seen
because you're worried about whether the
vaccinations or the covet is killing
people right
it's a reasonable thing to worry about
well
James sirawiki presents what looks like
official U.S excess death and covert
death's graph and his claim which is
backed up by the graph
which we don't believe is that the
excess deaths and the covid
moved in lockstep
like when when kovid was way up
also the excess deaths were way up so
above the covet
there was an excess deaths and then when
covid went down there was still more
excess deaths
but it followed covert and then when
covid went up and surged excess deaths
so so excess deaths is stayed above
covet the whole time how do you
interpret that
The Unexplained deaths were higher than
covid the whole time
but they worked in lockstep what's that
tell you
does that tell you that the vaccinations
are probably the cause of the extra
deaths
stress somebody says stress
all right
uh I only see one interpretation of it
so it makes me question whether the data
is right of course the only
interpretation of that is that it wasn't
the vaccinations that were killing
anybody
of course it kills some people as most
serious medicine does somebody's going
to die from every medicine I think
but it doesn't seem to show up in the
data
what if that's true
that debunks all of the vaccination
fear people now
but I don't believe it I don't believe
it okay
now even even if Fentanyl and let's say
overdoses were the explanation
would that follow the covid Curve
do you think you know even within like
say the summer versus the autumn
do you think like in the Autumn all the
ODS would go down at the same time as
the coven
here's the only interpretation that
makes sense
that it's all covered and we under
counted covet
we under counted it
right because there's also in the news
in the news also is somebody saying we
definitely over counted it
so we may have over countered it in the
hospitals but under counted it in some
other way were under counted and over
counted it we could have done both I
suppose
actually we could have done both we
could have under counted ones that we
should have counted
simultaneous with uh over counting
people we shouldn't have counted
that could both happen there's there's
nothing you know we don't know how it
Nets out but it would probably net out
exactly like the graph if the graph is
true
by the way I put that out there as the
best argument I've seen
to refute the vaccines are killing you
right now the various re the varis
report
would be
um
less important than this graph
if this graph is based on real data
right so you could forget the vares
report if you had actual death and
excess deaths because the various report
would you know end up showing up there
so if the various report is telling you
something real
then you would see you would see the
vaccination line
you know match the deaths but instead it
matches the covid which doesn't line up
exactly with the vaccination schedule
right so vaccinations sort of started at
nothing and went up
but the deaths went up and down only
according to the waves of covet not
according to the vaccinations according
to this data
that one person put on Twitter which you
should not rely on
all right so I can't give you any sense
that this is reliable
but it's the best argument I've seen on
the other side of the debate
would you accept that
would you agree that all of the clot
Birds think I just supported
vaccinations
would you agree with that too
if you heard this and only this and a
context you'd say oh my God he's at it
again he's at it again even though I
told you that you should not rely on the
data and even though I told you that the
context is knowing what the argument is
on both sides
but that's not acceptable to clubbers
Club Birds you must take a side you
cannot show the arguments on both sides
never never
yeah it's a graph so nobody believes it
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is all I
needed to say today
and
uh is there Sia still a dnrc no
but you've got a good memory
you know I don't think it's the covet
talk that's the problem
I feel like we need to know what
happened to us
so I'm not going to stop talking about
it but uh but I will as a
as a let's say uh meeting in the middle
I'll try to save it for the end of the
presentation so you can just bail out
because I understand a lot of people
don't want to hear it and I understand
that but the thing I I'm trying to only
talk about things that are new
right and the new stuff is really
important
because you really need to know were we
poisoned
don't you think that's important
wouldn't you like to know if you were
poisoned
I feel like there's almost nothing more
important than that going on it's like
way up there that's way up there on the
important scale but I get if if you're
happy with your decision
you're perfectly healthy I get it
societal breakdown is a problem yeah
yeah so I saw a story about the FAA
changing their EKG standards for Pilots
I don't believe the story
and the story is that so many Pilots
have I don't know irregular EKGs
suddenly in other words being blamed on
covid or the vaccinations that they had
to change the standard or there wouldn't
be enough Pilots
so now you got a bunch of Pilots with
you know sketchy tickers flying your
plane so that's the story I don't
believe it
I'm going to call fake news on that
story now it might be true
it might be true but um
that's to
I don't know that just doesn't sound
true
so I think you need a lot of
confirmation on that one it doesn't
sound true
all right
Scott is on team moderna
the clock birds are still confused
because they don't understand context
yeah follow the money always works
they change the standards because a
pilot shortages not the other way around
well that would make sense that would
explain the story wouldn't it
but I can't imagine they would get that
many more pilots
just by allowing in the ones with weird
EKGs
so I'm not sure that's the full
explanation Maybe
pilot here total BS oh okay so there's a
pilot on the locals platform
who's closer to it and says yeah total
BS no I believe that I believe that's
yes
uh oh the uh Tucker got a brush back
well
um
so all right so is that inconsistent I'm
saying organizations are guilty until
proven incident
um but still there's some conspiracy
theories that are just
beyond the the pale
so
uh
yeah let me put it this way if they
don't answer the question
then they're guilty
is that is that good enough if the FAA
won't answer a direct question about it
then you should assume they're guilty
yeah
it doesn't mean they are
doesn't mean they're guilty but you
should assume it if there's no
transparency so let's be consistent but
you can assume that they're being
you can assume they're guilt at the same
time you can think I don't think that's
true
there's no inconsistency there
because one's an assumption
rumors of a lawsuit
yeah
swallow uh
Matt Gates says Fang Fang is fake news
on the right swalwell did sleep with her
but years before he was in the house as
a younger man
huh
Maybe
soon you will see flu jab and Cova jab
combos will you do it hell no
uh the I I stopped getting regular flu
shots a long time ago because they were
obviously scams
you knew that right the regular flu shot
they tell you every year oh we created
it based on last year's virus so the
odds of it will have any impact on this
year's virus is all really small but you
should get it anyway
right uh yeah the odds this will help
are really small because it's not even
the right virus we we don't even know
what virus is going to mutate by then it
takes us a year to put these together or
whatever it is
so get them anyway
it never made sense
never made sense
all right well I'm going to say swallow
well is innocent until proven guilty
all right
um and that's all I got for now
uh frankly Scott says something
reasonable about vaccines stop it stop
stop acting like I'm reasonable nobody's
going to believe that
so this is a quote from somebody
uh in one morning I had to ground three
and I have three Pilots due to vaccine
injury according to Lieutenant Colonel
Theresa Long Brigade surgeon for the
first Aviation Brigade
does that sound true
do you think that she knew all three of
them had vaccine injury
that doesn't sound true
it might be true somebody said it but I
don't think it's true
all right
so just assume everything you see uh in
the news is not true
hungover
how's the drumming after the character
well they're both coming along
slowly
all right that's all for now YouTube
I'll talk to you later bye for now
best life
