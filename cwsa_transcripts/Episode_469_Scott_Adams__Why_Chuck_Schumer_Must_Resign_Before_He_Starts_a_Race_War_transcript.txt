jonathan
come on in here good to see you tyler
always early brad
ann good to see you
for those of you who are screaming out
that i'm bald
thanks for noticing i had not noticed
ah i'm bald ah when did that happen
hey everybody if you've got some kind of
a
vessel to hold liquids could be a cup or
a glass or a mug
might be a steiner cellist could be a
tanker
but whatever it is fill it with your
favorite liquid
and please join me for the simultaneous
sip
sublime so i'm watching the
continuing news about
the russia collusion hoax
and it feels to me like the biggest
story
is not being directly reported
you know there when you have a story
this big and this complicated
there are stories within stories and
there are branch off stories and related
stories so
there's so many stories going on that it
would be easy to miss
by far the biggest story and it goes
like this
when brennan clapper and comey were the
top intelligence guys under obama
putin was massively hacking
was massively interfering with our
elections
and by their own account they didn't do
anything
now i understand that obama told putin
to
quote cut it out once but there's no
other suggestion
that they did anything else so
the biggest story should be that our
intelligence people
were either incompetent or lying or
there's more to the story and maybe they
did do something that we don't know
about
but the second part of that story is
that having
failed to stop the problem themselves
to the point where they think it
influenced the 2016 election
remember president trump was not
president then
that was all obama territory so the
entire
mistake you know to the degree that that
the intelligence agencies
screwed up and let russia interfere that
was
the people who were the president's
critics that was brendan
clapper comey and the like
but it gets far worse that's not yet the
big story
that's just a big story and yes it does
get
mentioned it gets mentioned but it's
never really the headline is it
you don't see that as the headline point
it's just stated as a background fact
but here's here's the bigger point those
same
guys one side of office apparently
are two of the biggest drivers of the
biggest
most dangerous hoax
maybe in american history
a type of hoax that could create a
nuclear conflict
a type of hoax that could destabilize
the government of the united states
how is that not the biggest story
now i can certainly understand there was
a time when people thought
that the allegations against the
president for russia inclusion
were true or even if they thought well
they might be true we better wait for
the mueller report but now that we
know it wasn't true and we have
uh we have we have uh
quotes like this from brennan so brennan
when asked about
why he was so wrong he said and i quote
i don't know if i received bad
information
but i think i suspected there was more
than there actually was
speaking about the russia collusion
issue i got to read that again
because it's jaw-dropping i don't know
if i received bad information
so
what kind of head of the cia
uses information which is not reliable
obviously because it turned out to be
wrong uses
unreliable information to destabilize
the government of the united states
and to make our total
national security far more vulnerable
now at the very least he was incompetent
at his job of being the head of the cia
at the very least
worst case he's a flat-out trader
you know i can't read his mind but those
are those are the options based on the
evidence
that we have he's either massively
incompetent
and easily suckered which would be weird
for someone who is the head of the cia
or he's working against the interests of
the united states
is there any middle ground there there's
no middle ground right
um and then i saw a clapper trying to
you know trying to explain his
role and he does he does the whole thing
well i think you're conflating this with
that and then he just changes the
subject
so clapper at least is a
little bit better at being a weasel and
just avoiding the real question
but you know so uh then i watched uh
if you didn't see morning joe today
you're probably lucky
but morning joe decided to go on the
offense
and uh had to start uh having basically
a breakdown
about how angry he was that i don't know
that the journalists are being uh
journalists are being criticized
for this little russian collusion thing
so
his reaction i would say
i could i was i was having a little
trouble telling
how much was just acting because he knew
that he'd been caught
and so he's just trying to come up with
the best possible
approach and he figured going on the
offense was better than being on the
defense
so it could have been intentional i
can't read his mind
but it also looked unhinged
it looked like all the things that he's
been blaming the president for
it looked like someone who was not in
control of his mental faculties
and we watched it so those of us who saw
it
yeah i actually watched morning joe
acting in a way that in my opinion did
not look
mentally let's say
balanced now i'm not making a claim that
he has some organic
mental illness i'm not saying that i'm
saying that on this topic
he demonstrated a level of irrational
emotion
that is hard to explain in any rational
way
it looks like some kind of temporary
mental
meltdown that he turned into
entertainment for his audience
so i don't know what it is again i don't
know if it was a strategy
i don't know if it was an actual mental
breakdown
but i just note that he's been accusing
the president
of acting the way he acted and certainly
i wouldn't want
what i saw on morning joe i wouldn't
want that to be my president
[Laughter]
i'd be really worried i'd be really
worried
if i saw a president of the united
states any president
act the way morning joe acted this
morning because it didn't look
it didn't look all there don't know
could have been just a strategy but it
didn't look good
all right the big news of the day
if you follow my twitter is you know
that
um chuck schumer did
probably the most despicable lie that i
can remember
in in the political realm he went in
front of aipac
and repeated the uh the hoax
of all times to be repeating a hoax
of all times he goes in front of aipac
and uh you know a group of mostly jewish
audience
and says that the president called the
racist who were chanting
chanting anti-semitic things and chuck
schumer claims that the president called
them very fine people
that didn't happen the transcript very
clearly shows he excluded the
racist from the find people category and
he quote
said they should be condemned totally
those were his actual words there's no
ambiguity
about naming them by name and saying
they should be condemned
totally now
uh because this hoax the fine people
hoax
is so pervasive as a public service
and that's actually what it is i put
together this morning a tweet thread
where each of the the tweets in the
thread will give you a resource
a link an article um a photo or
something
a photo of the transcript so that you
too
can respond to people online when they
bring up the charlottesville hoax
you can send them the tweet thread so
you have that now
you might want to grab that link and
save it um
use bitly to shorten it so it's easier
to tweet
but you could just grab that link keep
it a little separate file
and then every time this hoax comes up
you can send them all the resources now
there was one thing that i should have
added because i've had this debate now a
number of times with a number of people
who believe to find the fine people
quote and what typically happens is when
you show people
here's what you said here's the
transcript that says in the clearest
possible language
that what you said is wrong as as i've
taught you and as you've observed
people don't change their opinion
based on the facts changing you would
think they would
you would think that if it says the
racist should be condemned totally
that that would be clear enough for the
people who said he called them fine
people
condemned totally fine people
those are not similar those are
opposites
and it's right in the same transcript
you know this far apart
it could not be clear and it's also on
video in case you don't believe the
transcript
it's on video so i include the video
link as well
now you think that would make people say
oh my god i guess i got this wrong
but do they do that not one person
now that's that's that's not true a few
people there was a
an economist and just a few other people
said to themselves my god i've been lied
to but what does everybody else do
they go down this rabbit hole
of hallucination and it goes like this
they say
scots got scott are you telling me
that people who were marching with
neo-nazis
are fine people they always say that
right
marching with they'll always add
marching with
to which i say marching with is not in
evidence
what is an evidence and the new york
times reported it
and i included their link in my tweet
thread i just mentioned
the new york times actually interviewed
a woman who came with a group of friends
who were free speech activists who were
very much anti-racist
they just happened to be in the same zip
code and they were very fine people
they were they were supporting the
constitution
and the right of free speech even if you
don't like it
i would argue that these are not just
fine people
they might be the finest of people you
know if i see somebody who's protesting
to support the constitution and and
they're accurate about how to
interpret it what's the first thing i
think
find people all right
now somebody else says would you march
with pedophiles
you are hallucinating whoever said that
because
march with is not an evidence we know
that there were people in the same zip
code
we know that some of them were antifa
some of them were the press
some of them were law enforcement some
of them were probably just observers who
came to see the
the show some of them were these free
speech activists who were pro-statue
actually they didn't even need to be
pro-statue they were just pro-free
speech which they think
include statues now
how many of those multiple groups were
marching with the actual tiki torch
people
the answer that's in evidence is zero
if anybody produced evidence that even
one person
who was not part of the neo-nazis was
marching with
them then i and everybody here would say
well that's not a fine person if you're
actually literally marching with nazis
you don't get to say well i'm only i'm
not really a nazi i just like to march
with them
you don't get to say that but there's no
evidence
that anybody who wasn't a nazi was
marching with them no evidence in fact
there's plenty of evidence that there
were just people in the same zip code
for their own reasons the free speech
reasons
who were not marching with them now the
next
so i should have included that response
sequence in my tweet the the other thing
that
i hear is if you show up for an event
and there are neo-nazis there and you
don't immediately leave
it shows you support them
well antifa was there
and they don't support the nazis they
were there to oppose them
law enforcement was there and they
weren't there to support
the nazis they were there to keep the
peace which they failed at doing
the free speech activists were there for
their own reasons
and and people say well you know how
could they be there in the same place
unless they had the same intentions
to which i say the most common situation
in the world is that people do things
for different reasons
that's not the exception that's the most
common reason
why is it that you go to las vegas well
you go to las vegas to gamble
somebody else might go there for the
shows
that doesn't mean that all the people go
there for the shows are also gamblers
it means that people can go to las vegas
for different reasons
likewise the charlottesville incident
attracted people who were there for very
different reasons
the police were there for their reason
anti-far for their reason
the actual nazis for their reason and
the free speech people
for their reasons nobody was marching
with the other groups
they were not marching with antifa they
were not they weren't they were not
helping the police people can be their
own group
you don't get to be guilty or where you
are not guilty
because you happen to be in the same
general area as somebody who is guilty
it doesn't work that way and if it and
if it did work that way you'd want to
change it immediately
because you couldn't live in a world
where you're guilty because you wandered
into the same zip code for your own
reasons
as guilty people
join me and drink to that
so here's what i say about chuck schumer
given that
by now he must know that this is not
a true statement the fine people thing
it's one of the worst things you could
say in public
and if you happen to have his profile
you're you're a leader
in the country it is actually the worst
thing you can say
the worst thing you can say is that the
president of the united states
if it's not true i mean if it were true
then of course you should say it
but the worst thing you could say for
the health of this country
is that the elected leader of the
president the president of the united
states
actually is supporting or complementing
neo-nazis
that's the worst lie you can tell that
is a lose your job lie no one should be
allowed to keep their job
after telling that level of lie on a
scale of one to ten
that's a freaking 10. that's a 10.
that is a 10 lie there's no lie higher
than the president of the united states
is actually
a nazi sympathizer you can't get
higher than that lie all right that is
there's nothing he can criticize the
president for saying
there's nothing that you know anybody's
ever said i can't even think of any lie
that's worse than that
in fact i challenge you i challenge you
to come up with a lie
that's more destructive than that now
that
the um the
the uh the russian collusion hoax was
untrue but untrue
is probably a case where people believed
it might be true
or there was hopeful thinking and it was
being investigated so we would soon know
that's probably the second worst lie or
at least it's in the range of the second
worst lie
but it is not even close to the pure
evil and destructiveness of the fine
people lie
um gulf of tonkin was pretty bad
uh yeah the but the gulf of tonkin
was really a pretense um
it's a different kind of lie in other
words if the gulf of tonkin lie had not
been told we would have found some
reason to get into that war because
we decided to get into the vietnam war
apparently
so you could say that was the gulf of
tonkin might be
among the worst lies in the country
but for pure evil to
this country the fine people lies
at the top of my list wmds
the liars were mostly not americans it's
the americans problem was believing it
so the wmds was the worst hoax
but i don't know that any americans lied
they were just
taken in by the lies of other people is
my understanding
there correct me if i'm wrong but i
don't think there's any evidence
that any americans knew the truth
and lied i don't know that that's an
evidence
uh and the gulf of tonkin was a special
case because they were just
it was an excuse for military action
that we wanted to do
so they were the the the point was to
get something done
that they thought would be good for the
country which is stopping the spread of
communism
so the intentions the intentions between
behind the gulf of tonkin lie were
probably
at least designed for the benefit
of the country so at least there was
some some notion
that there was a national benefit
that's the best case scenario i don't
know if everybody involved thought that
way
there's ample evidence that the ci they
lied to the president
okay so somebody's saying that the wmd
situation there is
evidence that people lied to the
president
i haven't seen that evidence but i'm
open to it i'm open to being convinced
and i don't know who exactly was the one
who was lying versus just
being wrong
yeah green land so there's
some place where the glaciers are
growing back and that was
unexpected um but i wouldn't make too
much of that
it's just fun because it happened the
week that president trump is having a
good week with all the hoaxes
but it doesn't mean anything about
climate change it's just an anecdote
all right
oh where's benno
so beto seems to be a one-trick pony
isn't he
um although i like his trick so beto
was kind of smart because he did this
standing on tables thing
and because he's so big and lanky and
stuff you know it's quite a show
and then there was a video of him
standing on top of a car giving a speech
and i thought who gave him permission to
stand on top of their car
would you let a politician stand on on
the hood of your car
feels like i don't know what that does
to the top of your car but i wouldn't
want him up there
anyway um i think that trick gets old
but so far it's been a good trick so i'm
going to give him
uh oh and one of one of the things i
wanted to say about
beto that i feel bad that i haven't said
this yet
all right now i try to retain my
credibility
by being complimentary and being uh
critical of both sides when they deserve
it
so i try not to hold back from either
side
and i also like to praise either side if
they do something right in the realm of
uh persuasion especially so i
and many other people uh had fun with
beto's odd hand motions all right
so although many people including me
thought it was funny and you know we
mocked him and it was a good time
but here's my actual opinion it's really
really good persuasion
if you if you if you want to be if i'm
being perfectly honest
um when he stands up there and his arms
start flailing
even at the same time you're saying to
yourself that's a lot of hand flailing
you're you're fixated on him you think
about him you remember him
it's a little bit out of the box and
because it's a little bit wrong but not
wrong enough that you go to jail or
lose your job or anything it's a little
bit wrong
which is what makes it exactly right
it's very much like trump's haircut
if you look at the president's haircut
you say i don't know i wouldn't have
done it that way i've never seen anybody
else with a haircut that way there's
you know i i get why he likes it i don't
know what the alternatives would be but
there's something about his haircut
that's just a little bit wrong
that little bit of wrong is a positive
for persuasion because while you're
talking about that little bit of wrong
it's not enough to disqualify you for
the office of president
but you're focusing on you're taking the
attention
so his wacky his wacky arm movements
i i give an a plus a plus
for persuasion and while you're mocking
him
just remember you're making him more
famous and giving him more attention
likewise it's very similar to what i've
said about aoc
i i think she's a racist and i think
she's
demonstrated that and and racist by
meaning that
she sees the world in in racial in
racial frame
and thinks that that's that's a an
important frame to manage to
um and you know i can
hate that and i can say like most of you
do or all of you that the green new deal
is not practical
and those are all true but if i'm gonna
grade her for persuasion
a plus um and she she had another
uh i know you hate to hear this you hate
to hear any compliments
but i'm gonna do it anyway i saw her
uh a quote where she was talking to some
group and she said that
the way women had tried to be successful
in the past
was to try to be like a man
in other words they would literally try
to imitate whatever the man was doing
because men had traditionally been
presidents etc
and and that that was inauthentic
and that the audience would see it as
inauthentic
and that she said she was going the
other way and that she would try to be a
leader
who was exactly true to her personality
her gender i suppose
her age her ethnicity in other words she
was just trying to be true to herself
and not somebody who's copying joe biden
if you will
and i thought to myself she has totally
succeeded at that
aoc has succeeded
correct me if i'm wrong all right
because this is sort of a new thought
so fact check me in real time if i'm
wrong
hillary clinton with her pantsuits and
her
approach is try was trying
be sort of like the female version of a
man
i would argue that kamal harris kamala
harris
pantsuit trying to be the female version
of a man you can see it right
i would say elizabeth warren same thing
i would say
uh gillibrand same thing
they're both feminine you know in their
ways other
you know female makeup and haircuts and
they talk about gender and stuff
so i'm not saying they're you know
identical to men i'm saying they're
trying to be the female version of a man
then look at aoc none of that
none of that aoc is a female version of
a leader
she says so in direct words and she
nails it
she freaking nails it all right she
makes
what she is actually work
and yeah klobuchar is another another
example
kind of the as with the other examples
that
it seems like she's trying to be the
female version of a man
so once again i know you hate it and i'm
not
trying to promote aoc just just talking
about the persuasion
part of the game um she has succeeded in
pulling off
one of the greatest you gotta say
it's one of the greatest um
i know mental shifts in politics i've
ever seen
because she i in the same way that he'll
let me let me give you some context i
said that hillary clinton
succeeded in breaking the glass ceiling
for the presidency
even though she lost she did win the
popular vote
and she made it easy for elizabeth
warren global gillibrand
uh harris she made it easy for all of
them to run for president
and what is nobody saying yeah tulsi
gabbard
what is nobody saying about the crop of
democrats that have so many women
in them have you seen have you heard one
person say
well the democrats have women who might
be the candidate i don't know how a
woman could ever be president
zero people say that because nobody
thinks it
nobody thinks it nikki haley another one
so in the same way that clinton to her
credit
broke the glass ceiling in the sense
that mentally we'd no longer think the
ceiling exists
right so we still have to cross that
barrier where there's a
woman who is president i think we'll get
there eventually
sooner or later it's going to happen
right but the mental part
that the actual glass ceiling gone
hillary clinton
shattered the glass ceiling it's one of
the greatest stories again
one of the greatest stories in the in
american history
and you can hate hillary clinton for a
thousand different reasons
but she did that she did that
um likewise aoc
i think has taken what hillary did and
moved it to the
next level which is not only can you
break the glass ceiling
i mean it's gone it's it's effectively
it doesn't exist
anymore not only can you break the glass
ceiling
but you don't have to act like a man to
do it
and that's that's new and i give her
credit for that
all right um
harris is copying hillary's fake laugh
you know i've heard
kamala harris's laugh and i gotta say
it's not a plus um
i know that she's trying to show more
personality because she got
sort of dinged for being a little too
serious
and then she she tried to evidently
um manage that uh impression away
by being more light and happy in doing
videos in which she's
she's conspicuously laughing and having
a good time
um
but uh yeah the the laugh
the laugh is a little jarring to me uh
i could i could use less of that
geraldine ferraro before hillary no i
think geraldine ferraro
confirmed the glass ceiling meaning that
she didn't win the presidency uh
which was she a vice presidential
candidate she was vice president right
but i don't think she changed a lot of
minds either i think our the
the mental glass ceiling was there i'll
give you know i'll give her credit for
being one of the pioneers for sure
but in terms of actually destroying the
glass ceiling that's that was all
hillary
you can't take that away from her all
right
um so let's enjoy the day
the the fake news industry will be
trying very hard to come up with some
reason why
they've been so wrong but really really
they were right
even though i was totally wrong i'm
totally right
so that'll be fun to watch today um
a few of you mentioned sarah palin as
being an example of
femininity in office and i would say
i see what you're saying and if you know
if you were going to compare
say hillary here well hillary
you know the most like a man
certainly you know there's there are
levels but i think aoc is
the one who's the the one who really
took it to the
ultimate level there's literally nothing
about aoc
that you would say looks like a man
there's just nothing
whereas even with uh sarah pillin you
could say
okay she's she's sort of in that
traditional mode even though she
retained a lot of femininity i mean she
definitely
she's stretched the box if somebody's
mentioning her attractiveness which of
course
uh colors our impressions yes
um yeah so yesterday
avenatti and uh mark
garagos uh are in trouble
legal trouble and they are no longer on
cnn
um how many how many
how many people who uh appear on or
well no one asks that question
jamil hill is on wendy williams
repeating the charlottesville hoax
yeah that hoax is going to be tough to
kill but i think with your help
we can do it so let's do that but by the
way
there's uh there is no better time
to kill a hoax than this week because
people are primed
to think okay maybe i could be wrong um
maybe not primed enough but it's a good
time to try to kill them
by the way uh don jr retweeted my tweets
read
with the debunking sources so it's going
to get a lot of attention today
uh garago's not charged yet
i wonder if he will be because as far as
i know avenatti is the only one who
spoke the words to nike
and i would think that you have to be
the one who says the words
to be guilty of um trying to
you know what is it extortion if you're
just somebody who
knows the guy who spoke the words i
don't know if that's enough
so i think i don't know there would be
any
any legal risk for him
now the other thing that i think is
hilarious
the other thing i think is hilarious is
that in 2020
think about this you know i love to look
at the unintended
um the unintended
um side effects of things so the
unintended side effect
of stormy daniels and all that came out
with that story
plus the russia collusion and all of
that investigation
is that in 2020 whoever trump is running
against
will be more of a risk of being a
russian puppet
than trump because
trump has been so thoroughly um
investigated and even his personal life
has been so
thoroughly vetted in the public that
even if
putin had something on trump it wouldn't
mean anything
like if if putin had something about
trump's personal life
what value would it have we would find
out there was something else
like the things we already know it would
have no value at all i mean he wouldn't
be able to
to blackmail this president at all and
if mueller
can't find anything it seems unlikely
that putin
has something that he can that he can
use but
pick any democrat doesn't matter who you
put in there
put biden in there sanders koala harris
doesn't matter
and ask yourself what does russia have
on that candidate
and the answer is don't know
maybe maybe
trump he's about as clean as you can get
because he's been so thoroughly
analyzed but whoever he runs against
what do you know you know would would
russia
suddenly stop being interested in in
blackmailing people
you know why would i'm sorry would putin
suddenly stop
being interested in blackmailing
candidates or presidents
of the united states if he ever wanted
to do that
if it were ever a thing you'd have to
assume he'd keep doing it
so whoever trump runs against is is a
russian pup at risk
compared to trump who's been checked
down so thoroughly
um
oh yeah and then schiff what is the
committee that
adam schiff is on is it foreign
intelligence
how can you have adam schiff on the
foreign intelligence committee
that would be like all right somebody
help me up with a
funny analogy adam schiff
on the foreign intelligence committee
would be like my dog in mensa
it would be like a cannibal working at
the mortuary
it would be like a serial killer
having the nuclear codes it would be
like
uh sending sending military assets
to al qaeda it would be like
having isis in charge of uh
health and human services and there must
be a better one
you can come up with oh it's the
intelligence committee
or just the wait what is it
i probably missed it somebody probably
said it while i was looking away
um did somebody tell me foreign
intelligence or just intelligence
committees
i don't know but if schiff is on any
kind of a committee
that has to do with intelligence
shouldn't we demand we get a little
something better than that something a
little better it would be like michael
jackson running a daycare center
thank you very much thank you and and
i'm here all night
yes it would be like adam schiff being
on the intel
on any intelligence committee is exactly
like
[Laughter]
michael jackson running a daycare
pretty good
somebody said it's like hillary somebody
said it's like hillary being in charge
of the treasury
that's a double a double joke i like
that
[Laughter]

what it is
uh all right well that's funny enough
