good morning everybody
and welcome to another amazing episode
of coffee with goddamn it's the best
thing that's ever happened to you
in your whole life hate it when my nose
is running when i see as soon as i go
live
it's like psychological
well but enough about me
more about you
what could we do to make your day
amazing
well i've got an idea and it begins with
a copper monger glass on tanker jealous
aside a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called
simultaneous sip hold on
hold on i'm getting a note
from democrats
it's no longer called the simultaneous
up
they're redefining it quick before they
redefine it do it do it
i think we got it under the wire
well here's some big news joy behar of
the view
you might know her as no friend of
republicans
i don't know if you've heard but she's
not a big fan of president trump
have you heard
and even she said of the january 6
hearings
that there's no way trump is going to be
prosecuted because
they found nothing
even joy behar
said out loud in public
that if all they have is the word find
that word means something else
joy freaking behar
just got out of the bubble
did you think she was going to escape
the bubble first
like i somehow imagined you know the
bubble that the left is in
that she'd be the last one out
she got out of the bubble no i don't
know if she could stay out
but she literally could see the january
6th thing for what it actually is
and i can't think of one other
prominent trump supporter who's done
that yet
is there any other example
is there any
you know well-known pundit who was
anti-trump
who's looked at it and said yeah i'm
still anti-trump but i gotta admit
there's nothing there in that january 6
stuff
yeah anyway to me that was big news
here's some more big news
i've i've told you before that the
biggest market in the future
will be building cities from scratch
because we're so much better at knowing
what it is that somebody would need in
the modern world trying to retrofit our
old buildings
for the modern lifestyle doesn't make
sense
we have so much better ways to be you
know zero energy and everything else
and so the saudis i didn't know about
this there
they started a
like a half a trillion dollar smart city
and that they'll have all these
underground layers of services and
transportation so above the
above those layers would be the homes
itself
and they'd have everything from um
the
the city would be designed
so that everybody can walk to everything
they need so nothing would be outside
walking distance so you would never
really need a car
you know except to leave the city i
suppose
it's supposed to be zero energy and
there's
par part of their thing would be a
floating city that's just often the uh
just offshore
so they figured out how to make a
floating city you know connected to land
still so it's not floating way out
but they've apparently designed
a floating city
they think that they can make that work
now think about that
the saudis
are building a zero energy city
either the saudis can see the future
this is what i i hoped america would be
first at but
you know it's
it's hard to accept that america is not
sort of the leader
in doing cool futuristic things anymore
it used to be it was just us
don't you remember that
i felt like if there was any kind of
futuristic thing being built at all it
was always america but now this the
saudis seem to be way ahead of everybody
building this futuristic city
um
but along those lines
i realized yesterday that elon musk has
sort of slowly assembled
a 3d printer to make entire cities
do you believe that
the elon musk has assembled the assets
to create a 3d printer to just print a
city
here's what i mean so here's what he
already has he's got this uh boring
company you know these gigantic devices
that board tunnels
and so you can if you wanted to build
something like this saudi
futuristic smart city
you need a lot of underground facilities
so he's got that so he's got the boring
company to build the tunnels
he had announced some time ago that they
figured out how to make a brick maker so
that the dirt
from the tunnels can be pressed into
bricks on site
so you turn the dirt into bricks
he has also announced that
he's building robots
so tesla will have a robot
and also he's working he's you know he's
deeply invested in ai both through tesla
and other investments
and then of course he's got the solar
panel stuff you know the solar wall for
your home to have a zero energy home
so think about it imagine this boring
thing you know going through and making
underground tunnels
the bricks
the dirt is being turned into bricks on
site
the robots are taking the bricks and
assembling them
according to an ai
you know guidance
and they're built to the best designed
homes so you don't have to worry if the
home is poorly designed
because it's the best design ever the ai
just found the best design ever and
built a little home
and
then after the little home is built um
the robot slaps on some solar panels
it makes it uh
zero energy
and you basically you could basically
just 3d print a town
without any humans involved you're very
close
you could have the whole city being
built by robots
without any human being even being on on
site
once you just you know release them to
do their thing
well what else is new and wonderful
there's a startup
in the east coast called wonder
and they have food delivery trucks but
here's the
wrinkle
they finish cooking the food in the
truck at your curb
so what what's the worst thing about uh
pickup food
it gets like a little soggy by the time
it gets to you there's a lot of food
that doesn't travel
but you don't also want to go there to
the restaurant it's got its own problems
so now the there's a high-end truck
it's like a little kitchen in it and the
food i think is is prepped so it's
almost cooked so they they just finish
it when they get there which is easier
so they don't have to be chefs they're
just finishing and apparently people
like it but the green people are
complaining because it's a diesel truck
so apparently a big diesel truck parks
in front of your suburban home for two
hours or whatever it takes maybe an hour
and
it's basically a food truck but it's
high-end
so you're getting high-end steaks and
sushi and stuff that you wouldn't
normally associate with a food truck
apparently it's you know it's got like
billions of dollars of funding
now here's my problem with our food
delivery
and i'll
and i'll give you an anecdote from my
local safeway right so i happen to live
in the town by coincidence
that is the headquarters for the safeway
grocery store
brand
so the safeways in my town tend to be
the ones that try things first because
that's where the ceo lives you know and
basically they can check it out easier
because it's right in town
so one of the things my town has is
these special new age
shopping carts
where you can scan your you can scan
your product as it's going into the cart
and the cart weighs it and it's got some
other technology it even has a camera
so it can tell if you put something in
the car and it didn't scan properly
it'll call somebody whatever
so isn't this great
now when you hear that you can you can
have all of your stuff paid for without
standing in line aren't you happy about
that
it's great isn't it
well
well there was one little wrinkle with
the process
they don't let you take these fancy
carts into the parking lot
what
that's right
once you've done your shopping you have
to unload your car
into a standard shopping cart
every item
now keep in mind that the items in your
first shopping cart are not in bags
it's the stuff you took right off the
shelf
so one item at a time you reach into
this high-tech cart and put it
into the low-tech cart while you're
swearing what piece of
technology is making me god like this
piece of why did i waste my goddamn
 time doing this if you're gonna
make me just move every little
piece of
tic-tac and eye drop and
vegetable one at a time from
this one to this one
by the time you're done
you want to rip the store apart for
putting you through it
it's like the whole point of this thing
was to save me time
and i can't even believe how hard it is
now
you might even say to yourself
well it'll still save time
you know because it's not that hard to
move it in
no because the technology almost never
works
almost every time you've got to call an
assistant and wait for them and
they'll
pour through things and work it out so
the technology is completely broken
here's what's wrong with food
there are a hundred people who
have to touch it including you 15 times
just to get it in your mouth
you know you drive to the store you put
it in your cart you take it out of the
cart you put it on the
checker thing checker puts it in the
cart car into the car car into
the uh counter on the kitchen
counter into the refrigerator
refrigerator and then and that's like
halfway through the process
that's like halfway you still gotta cook
the
and throw it away and everything
so
one of the things that i think the
pandemic did for us
is is it sort of
made us all deal with how bad our food
delivery system is
it's very inefficient
we've got to get the production of the
food
right down close to your table
so that and and prepare it more easily
let the robots prepare it grow the
gardens locally there's probably some
way to solve this but the whole food
delivery thing is just completely
inefficient
but maybe this wonder truck will be part
of a solution
in my perfect world there would be
trucks
hovering nearby and i would open my app
and i would see where the trucks are
and i would see oh there's a
truck that has good stakes over here and
this truck has some sushi
and i'd say oh
well i'm not that hungry so my favorite
truck is pretty far away
but i don't mind because you know i'm
not that hungry
so it feels like
my perfect world is to have the food
ready to go
on a truck
but not never too far from my
neighborhood you know within 20 minutes
that sort of thing
maybe that's where it's going
so um
well let's let's put this all in context
could we
all right
let me summarize
so we've got the saudis building
building a half trillion dollar smart
cities pretty impressive
pretty impressive
you've got elon musk who's assembled so
many assets doing other things
that if he wanted he could put him
together and 3d print a city
which is kind of cool
and then this wonder startup might be
redefining food those are big big things
really really changing the nature of
civilization
let's see what the democrats are doing
so the saudis and musk and these
startups are changing civilization
itself in the most basic and important
ways
uh checking in with the democrats
they'll see the headlines see what
they've done for us today
well they've
re-engineered some common words
they've also solved big problems
let me tell you about all the problems
they've solved for example
i used to be worried about a recession
but they tell us that the definition of
a recession
has now miraculously changed from what
they specifically told us in 2008 same
people actually this guy named brian
diese in 2008 he told us economists have
a technical definition of recession
which is two consecutive quarters of
negative growth which we've had
and that yesterday he's updated his
definition of recession to
two negative quarters of gdp growth is
not the technical definition of
recession
what kind of an idiot thinks that come
on
so they save this from a recession by
redefining the work
but i'm still worried about inflation
aren't you
at least we dodged the recession by
redefining the word but what about
inflation well don't worry
don't worry
democrats have you covered yeah
they've decided to
change the definition of inflation so
that one's going away
now that's not these are not the only
victories they've had
they redefined a vaccination from
something that protects you to something
that maybe makes you not so sick
they redefined the word find
to be stealing and lying
uh recession of course has a new
definition insurrection
uh insurrection used to mean trying to
take over the government usually an
armed situation and now it's just
complaining
it's just complaining
um they've redefined i just found this
one out today that uh was it planned
parenthood who redefined uh
pregnancy
you wouldn't think that could get
redefined but they've made a distinction
between ectopic pregnancy and those
things which are real pregnancies i
guess by their definition so that they
could still have uh what you might call
an abortion but they wouldn't call it
that because that's not really a
pregnancy it's just some kind of an
ectopic thing
so they've defined redefined that way
fascism used to mean one thing but now
it means a whole different thing
um did you used to know what a woman was
he used to know what a woman was
now not so sure
not so sure
white supremacy means obviously anything
you want it to mean green
uh it used to mean no nuclear
which didn't make sense but now it does
include nuclear so they've redefined
what green means
because they needed it to solve a
problem
as soon as they needed green to solve
the problem they changed the definition
of it
do you notice
any
theme or pattern here
the entrepreneurs and indeed other
countries are doing gigantic things to
re-engineer civilization and all of its
systems
the democrats
are telling us that we're using words
wrong but they're fixing it by changing
the definitions and making all of our
big problems go away
so good for them
um
and so now that they've made all of
these uh terms mean something different
than what you thought
uh i just published a robots read news
comic you'll see that today
and uh i just have one warning now that
we know all of these words that you used
to know what they mean
means something else
uh the word i'm worth most worried about
now is
sustainable because it seems like all
the words started meaning the opposite
of what they meant
so they're working really hard to make
the world
sustainable
and there was a time when i thought that
meant you know you all get to stay alive
and things would be fairly good
but if they redefine that
it might mean to murder us all
could be coming
well this will surprise you
quite a bit
but trust in the media uh
has gone to an all-new all-time low
i wonder what happened
was there something that happened to the
media that caused their credibility to
just start to
you know it's all trump
trump actually destroyed the media
because the media went after trump and i
think what he said is well you might
take me down
but you're going with me what's trump's
popularity now
high 30s
low 40s
well the media's popularity is uh
public trust is down to seven percent no
7
is for congress
uh
uh stressing less than tv news yeah only
the democratic-controlled congress
is less trusted
than the news business which is down to
11 trust the news
and newspapers 16 also near the bottom
so tv news and newspapers are basically
completely mistrusted at this point in
time
i wonder what caused that
and maybe
i would suggest that we need a truth in
naming law for legislation
because if you can create legislation
that increases inflation
and you can name it the inflation
reduction act so that morons think
they're voting for the wrong thing
i feel like you need some kind of law
that says that the bill
should say something about what is in
there
or it should have a generic name
could you can you imagine forcing
congress to
properly name their own bills
they would never approve that would they
because they know that the only way that
they can make stuff work is to fool you
into thinking of something else
you don't believe that
you don't think that the government is
intentionally fooling you
so that you'll that they can get stuff
approved
well now there's this big
this this big spending bill which isn't
fully approved the senator still has to
prove it but if it gets approved it's
called the inflation reduction act of
2022. and would you like to know what's
in it
because it's it's like a really big
spending bill
so if you don't mind
i'd like to tell you what's in it
now
keep bear with me it's like a really big
spending bill
tons of complexity
but i feel like i can i can do this and
keep your interest all right you ready
so i went to uh
cnn to find out what are the details of
this giant bill because it's the number
one headline
so so if the biggest headline in the
country is this bill
there's gonna be a lot of reporting on
what's in it
so i went to look for what's in it
and apparently the congress has released
a one-page description
what
what
i thought i read that wrong
no i'm sorry it's not a one-page
description
a one-page description would be like
crazy for like a gigantic you know
trillion dollar bill
like
it's actually a one page fact sheet
it's a one page fact sheet
i'm not making this up
i'm not making this up
congress hasn't told us what's in the
bill or anybody else
cnn doesn't know what's in the bill
i'm not making that up did you know that
it's the headline
there is no document that tells us
what's in the bill except a one-page
faction
but i guess i guess medicare would be
allowed to negotiate prices i like that
part
that's good
um
and let's say what else it would uh a
ton of money 369 billion into energy and
climate change programs
with the goal of reducing carbon
emissions by 40
by 2030.
okay
but
i feel like that fact sheet
let me let me just mention this
and see what you think
so cnn reports there's a one page of
fact cheat
just one page
wouldn't you think
i don't know this is just me
but if if congress produced a one page
fact sheet
first of all there's no copyright
problem on that right
if the government if the government
publishes something we all own it
so there's no copyright
what would be the reason for cnn not to
publish the one page fact sheet
can you think of what
why would the news
not publish
one page
of a fact sheet
have you seen it
it exists they told us it exists
you're telling me that a one-page fact
sheet just an image
so that we can see what they saw instead
of relying on them to interpret the one
page
really
really you can't show me one page
somebody says they don't have it
even worse
you don't think cnn can get a one-page
fact sheet from somebody in congress
there's nobody in congress that'll give
cnn the one-page fact sheet really
really
how can you conclude anything except
your government and the news business
and the news business don't want you to
know what's in it
how can you conclude anything else
because the the bar of difficulty for
showing you what's in it at least the
fact sheet is zero
zero
there's no friction at all
how hard is it for a news business
to include an image on their web page
zero
it's just what they do every day there's
no extra
this is the news here's the picture here
it is paste
how in the world can you explain that
any other way then both the government
and the news business this is important
are colluding
to not tell you what the government is
doing
and they're doing it right in front of
you
right in front of you
there's no ambiguity about this
whatsoever
we're not telling you what's in the
spending bill
every one of these should
be fired
all of them
everybody in the news business who
didn't report this the way i just did
should be fired
if you're in the news business and you
say well congress won't tell us the
details so we're not even going to
report this
i'd say okay that's okay
but if the news business colludes with
the government to not tell you wasn't a
bill
they all need to be fired
you know the media the government
and that's
that is a low behavior that's
so far beyond and you know what most
people think
how many of you thought somebody must
have seen the bill
how about you thought that right until i
told you that nobody's seen it
didn't you think well somebody's seen it
they voted on it somebody seen it no
i don't think the people who voted on
assad do you
do you
i assume the bill is some you know
ginormous thing with many pages it's
really boring and if you looked at it
you might not even know what you were
looking at
right if you were flipping through it
and you saw some expenses would you know
this expense for this line item is too
much or too little not really
so i think that even the news says if we
looked at it we wouldn't know what we're
seeing
so it's
it's probably a document that's by its
design is made for you not to be able to
penetrate it
that's a real thing
i used to prevent i used to prevent
freudian slip
it used to be my job to present
information to management
do you think i ever presented it in a
way that was designed to hide the truth
well when i was asked to
yep
sometimes you held it you heard the
truth it would be some truth you didn't
think was useful but that was your
opinion
so you'd basically be managing your
superiors by
hiding from them any truth
that might be a problem to you
so managers don't really manage
i don't know if i'm the first one to
tell you this managers don't manage
because they have to rely on their
underlings to tell them what's true
so the underlying the underlings
decide what's true
and that
defines what a leader could even make a
decision on
so really
yeah
yeah really it's
the whole system is broken
remember i told you was it a week or two
ago that i thought inflation had peaked
and maybe you didn't believe me
wall street journal is reporting at
least in an opinion piece with lots of
data to back it up
that inflation has probably peaked
so
do it do i get an atta boy for that
we don't know if it's true yet just the
wall street journal but i did say it
before the wall street journal and the
wall street journal gave us some backup
thank you thank you i got i got another
boy there that's all i wanted
so i do think inflation peaked
i think we're going to be okay
i think the recession and by the way let
me say this publicly
if trump had told you
that suddenly two periods of uh negative
gdp growth
no longer meant recession because this
is a special case i actually would have
supported that
because
the economy is is a psychology machine
and i've often said that the the role of
a leader is to be more optimistic than
the facts allow
to be more optimistic about the economy
than the facts actually suggest
you should be not crazy optimistic but
you should be above the actuality
because that's what gets people
feeling positive about the economy and
then it's a self-fulfilling
thing
so
in this case i'm going to agree with the
biden administration
they're calling this recession
now i do think they have to answer for
the fact that they had a different
definition than they did in 2008
right do we all agree with that they
have to answer to the fact that they
changed the definition
but they have a reason
they have a reason
and the reason was here's how i would
have done it so so the biden
administration spokespeople have
completely botched
this
let me be the spokesperson for biden for
a minute and i'll take the hard question
that they couldn't answer
uh scott
uh you work for the biden administration
hypothetically
and uh why did you used to say that uh
the definition of uh recession was two
consecutive quarters of gdp you said
that publicly and specifically but now
you say it's more of a holistic
situation how do you explain that
easily
if you're not a idiot
you could do it too right
how hard would it be
to explain that away
you'd have to be an idiot not to be able
to handle that easy question let me do
it for you
um what's the name of the spokesperson
something
gene
never remember names like three three
word name
what's the press secretary's name
not fang fang
stop it
all right karine jean pierre
that's a hard name to remember isn't it
karine gene
green gene if you remember that the
first two rhyme it's easier
green jean
pierre all right
so here is me doing her job
uh why did you change the definition of
recession
i say well
the
there's sort of a rule of thumb
definition the two consecutive periods
of gdp and i would say that for probably
98 of every case
that simple rule
pretty much is accurate
but there's a special case
where the economists would say
and largely most of them would agree
with this that there is a special case
and the special case would be when
things get temporarily knocked out of
whack but for some reason you know that
it's temporary
that's what the pandemic did
so the pandemic temporarily whacked us
in a way that we know is recoverable
because we know what did it we know how
to get back so this isn't like a regular
a regular business as usual recession
if this were business as usual
then probably the two periods of gdp
would would capture everything you
needed to capture because there wouldn't
be any other variables but when you're
coming out of the pandemic everything's
upside down
so for a while our standard definitions
probably won't work and that was a good
rule of thumb and we'll probably go back
to it
after we've chewed up you know the
trouble from the pandemic and we get
back to some kind of a baseline
if you ask me again in five years to
define a recession i'd probably go back
to the two
you know just say two g two periods of
gdp because once the baseline is is
stable
then you could just say that rule of
thumb starts working again but at the
moment there's a special case and it
doesn't work and i think you're all
adult enough
to understand that even a simple rule of
thumb
would have exceptions we're all adult
enough to understand that aren't we
there should be exceptions to any rule
of thumb
now
tell me in the comments
did i not nail that
i nailed it i absolutely
positively
slayed it
now let me ask you this
how hard was that
not
it wasn't hard
when you watch the best that the biden
administration can give you for a
spokesperson
the best you can do
for a spokesperson is to act like you
don't know how to answer that question
that's really bad work
like that's really bad work i don't
think we can
overlook that the spokesperson for the
president is
barely functional in my opinion
these are not hard questions to answer
they're really not
they're really not
what about when they say why are you
calling this gigantic bill the inflation
reduction act when you're spending a
bunch of money
and you know they'll be like blah blah
blah blah here's how i'd answer it
well
what matters what matters to people is
how much they're spending
economists are going to call some of
that inflation and some of its other
problems supply chain everything else
but what matters is what you pay
so what this bill does
is it's going to lower your health care
costs
which are a big part of your spending
now that's not
that's not an answer to inflation in
general but i think you'll feel that in
your pockets so while we can't solve
inflation in general right away we do
have to work through this excess
money that's in the system there are a
few things that we can do
and i'd like you to know that just
because we can't do everything
that doesn't mean we're not going to do
the things we can do so while it's true
that our title the inflation reduction
act you know that's a little uh
let's say it's
aspirational the bill does have very
specific things that we're sure you
would agree will lower your costs in
some big areas
we're going to work on the rest because
inflation is not something you solve
with one spending bill
i think you'd all agree with that but
because it's so important that we get
some of your key costs
uh
yeah
and i'm maybe something else went down
but
you're right there's a lot more work to
do
how hard would that be
how hard would it be to explain yeah the
title is a little aspirational
you know this won't solve all of
inflation but we're going to pick some
key things and if we i think we can take
a bite out of a few things and that'll
help you out
how hard is that
that's not hard
right when when you see how bad or how
badly
the uh
the representatives of her explaining
the democrat
stuff it's it's just heartbreaking
that they can't even explain their own
position
it's incredible
here's a question that you haven't asked
yourself
i keep seeing a bunch of people complain
that trump should have done more on
january 6 and specifically one of the
things they say he should have done more
of
is to try to get a bigger military
presence in the capital
now there's some
there's some gray area about whose job
it is to do what and who asked for what
ahead of time and who refused it
and there's mayor bowser and there's
nancy pelosi and they they both have
some something to do with who can you
what kind of military or
presence or how much security there is
so there's a whole bunch of people
involved
but let me ask you just this one
question
imagine if you could
imagine if you could
that president trump thought there might
be trouble
and so being a good president just the
way the democrats suggest he should have
been
he had requested and let's say he got
approval for because some of you are
going to say he did ask for it but he
didn't get approval which by the way has
been debunked
i don't know which is true the debunk or
the claim
but i saw what i thought was a credible
debunk that said he never asked for had
only talked about it all right so i
don't know i don't know what's true
there but just be aware
if you think it's a fact that he asked
for it and it was denied
that the news is reporting the opposite
and there's a 16 chance that the news is
right so
put that in your
put that in your considerations
all right but here's the only question
that i'm going to get to imagine if you
will
that trump had asked for let's say
national guard
and
and it had been approved
play it through in your head
trump asks for a large military presence
and it gets approved and they show up
play it in your head
how does that go
really good
because they they eliminate the violence
right
no
that's fascism
that's fascism
if you put an actual military force
there the democrats would say would say
what would they say
go
the democrats say hitler
hitler
it's hitler it's a coup it's a military
coup and then all of the
then all of the reporting would be about
how
the head of that particular unit was
pro-trump
i don't know if that would be the case
but imagine if that were the case
you'd say wait a minute
trump called a military unit with the
head of the military voted for trump
well that's a coup if i ever saw an
insurrection that's an insurrection
do you understand there was nothing he
could do
and am i the first person to tell you
that
there was nothing he could do
if he had if he had actually gotten a
bigger military force that totally would
have worked against him
if you say to me but scott
you would have stopped the violence
i wouldn't do it
if you said scott you would have
prevented the deaths
of let's say ashley babbitt
and you know maybe people who committed
suicide because they had been accused i
don't know so you can you could
attribute injuries and death to the
event but suppose you said to me i can
make all of that go away
all you have to do is have the military
show up
nope
nope i will not take that deal
i will not take that deal
i will not let the military if i have a
choice
i don't want the military in my capital
i'd rather the citizens fight it out
and you know some of them go to jail
they go to jail
like this was people the people as soon
as you get the military in there it's
all wrong
yeah it's kent state it's everything as
soon as the military's there
it's a different situation
and it never changes
so it would have forever been painted as
republicans are clearly the fascists we
believe they are
clearly they had planned a military
takeover well it didn't work that's what
they would report
trump tried a military takeover
but luckily luckily for us
the military was loyal and they didn't
follow his orders what orders and then
you'd find out there were never any
orders to conquer the capital but it
would be reported that there were
everything would have been way worse
if the military had been there and the
military being national guard
have i made my case
and by the way
has anybody asked that question
if trump had done what people said they
wanted him to do
would they be happy with that
would they be happy with that no
not even a chance
all right
well people are
saying again on twitter
that people are dying they think from
the vaccination complications
and so often they are there's a whole
once again it's trending and people are
showing anecdotes of individual people
who seem to have died
relatively soon after a vaccination shot
let's call them shots so you don't bug
me for calling them vaccinations
so
i don't know if uh anecdote i don't know
if anecdotal reports
are telling us anything or not
the way they should be used as it is as
flags not as proof would you agree
that the anecdotal reports should only
go as far as making us say oh maybe we
should look at the data more carefully
or something
but they shouldn't be proof
no matter how many you see
because you could easily be fooled by
anecdotes
that is why
what did we invent so that you wouldn't
be fooled by anecdotes what did
civilization create
to prevent us be to be fooled by our own
eyes so easily
science
science
right so unless science is and again
science could be wrong too but unless
science has done a little work on this
your anecdotes are not worth anything
but
would i ever be able to convince you of
that no no because the reason you need
science is that our brains are not
capable
of dismissing anecdotes
we can't do it
you know as much as you want to be smart
and say all right
i'm going to think scientifically i know
that this one anecdote if my neighbor
dropping dead 10 minutes after getting a
vaccination doesn't really mean anything
but it really seems like it means
something
you can't really get past it
anecdotes are absolutely convincing
so what do you do
well i've suggested a solution
uh you could call it a vaccination to
your anecdote
it's more of a therapeutic because
you're already infected
so let's call it a therapeutic
to your anecdotes and it goes like this
i'm gonna meet your anecdote with a
better anecdote ah you didn't see that
coming
i'm gonna i'm gonna see your anecdote
and up at one anecdote it goes like
this how many famous people are there in
the world
let's just say the united states how
many famous people
would you recognize their names if i
made a list
of all the famous people it'd be pretty
long right probably a thousand probably
a thousand
names you would actually recognize oh
yeah justin bieber you probably get
300 musical artists right there's
probably at least 300 musicians and
bands and stuff that you can recognize
many then you throw in the politicians
the celebrities of allah so maybe a
thousand
right so of the thousand celebrities how
many of them died from covet
and how many of them died from the
vaccination complications
because a thousands quite a bit
it's like an anecdote that's better than
your anecdote about your neighbor your
neighbor is just one person maybe you
know about four there's an anecdote
today about four doctors who died in
some hospital allegedly i don't believe
it but that's that's the story
basically i don't believe that the story
is true that four doctors died
unexpectedly
and if they did it's probably something
else
but you know like fentanyl
i'm not accusing
i'm just saying
doctors have access to the good stuff
all i would take is one bad batch of
fentanyl but i'm just saying
there could be other reasons that
doctors die suddenly
now
how
but there's my question
how many celebrities like an actual
famous person died during the pandemic i
believe the answer is zero
am i wrong
that died because of covet
now hank aaron
hank aaron died
hank aaron was how old
let's say you take people under
under 75.
how many famous people under 75 died of
coven
how old was milo he was probably close
to 75 wasn't he
all right so that's how many people died
of covet who were famous and i'm seeing
a lot actually more suggestions over on
the locals so they're saying herman cain
hank aaron
joe diffy i guess people have heard of
him
uh so meatloafy already said
john prine
he sounds relatively famous
right marvin
hagler marvin hagler all right so that's
uh several people who died of covet
allegedly
right allegedly how many people are
confirmed
to have died from the vaccination
it's zero right
now you might say to yourself but scott
that's because they hide that
information
do they really
do they
they all have different doctors
you know every celebrity has a different
doctor you think all of the doctors are
hiding that information
maybe
i mean that would be a lot of individual
choices that are suspicious
because it seems to me that a hollywood
doctor would be the first one to want to
get some attention
and say people
nobody's listening to me
but i i've spotted this danger in my
practice
i know seems to be the hollywood and
famous people doctors would be exactly
the people who would tell you if they
had any story that they thought was
worth listening to
so
while i do not claim that my
vac somebody's saying justin bieber is
having a reaction from the vaccination
i don't think there's any allegation of
that
well there's an allegation but i don't
think there's any evidence of that
now
dawn wells
all right so i'm just going to offer my
anecdote
to match your other anecdotes
what we know anecdotally is lots of
people died from coved
but
people dying have actually shot it's
weirdly undocumented
weirdly undocumented and you have to ask
yourself why
now
let me be clear
is it impossible
that there is a global
this is a key part
a global uncoordinated
conspiracy
to keep you from knowing
that there are vaccination complications
more than you imagined
a lot of people say yes
what do you think so on locals people
are saying yes
uli says wow you're really behind on
this one
do you think that i haven't seen the
same stuff you've seen
i've seen it
i've seen all the
zillions of claims of vaccination injury
i i'm i'm
swimming in it
i'm totally up to date
it's just that all of it gets debunked
eventually
so far
right so far it's already been
uh you're not on gab
well there's a reason sometimes the
things don't make it across
right
did they die from coven or with covid
yeah i guess that's still a question
well so let me be clear i do not rule
out i do not
rule out
that the people who say it is a giant
conspiracy
maybe
yeah i would say that's a solid
possibility
will you accept that as my opinion
solid possibility
that the vaccinations are more dangerous
than we think but i haven't seen
anything that tells me it's true
yet
i could be convinced
i could be convinced
but so far nothing
now let me ask you this
do you think anybody is paying me
to gaslight you on vaccinations or that
i have something to gain from it
do you know that i only lose when i talk
about this topic you all know that right
you all know that i know
that i personally
lose really a lot whenever i talk about
the topic
so why do i do it
why do i do it
it's for you
it's not for me
like i don't get a thing out of
this it's all bad for me this is pure
expense
i'm basically reaching into my pocket
and hoping it does something good for
you
like it's all bad for me but just
appreciate that will you
i'm going to ask you directly to
appreciate that i take that risk on your
behalf now you might not want me to do
it
but my intention has nothing to do with
my self-interest i just don't think
there is any here i don't see anything
in it for me
i see pure cost
but i do it for you
that's part of our deal right
like i'm trying to do stuff for you
often you do things for me quite a lot
of things the things that you do for me
are amazing
right and i always appreciate them so
i'll try to try to pay you back when i
can
all right
um
do you believe the january 6 hearings
have moved the needle in public opinion
well i'll tell you what rasmussen says
rasmussen talked to likely u.s voters
yeah about the house u.s select stuff
and it turns out that 34 percent of
likely u.s voters say the j6 committee
hearings
have made them more likely to vote
democrat
thirty four percent
but thirty percent say uh made them more
likely to vote republican
is that roughly the same as the
percentage of republicans and democrats
as there are
can you
can you give me a fact check on that
because i believe there are more
democrats than republicans and it's
roughly that right 30 34
something like that
so basically it's just people lined up
with their own party right
if if the only thing that happened is
people sort of aligned with their own
party
and i didn't i didn't see the crosstabs
i'm sure that's not it's not 100 sure
that it's not 100 by party of course
but to a large extent
party affiliation seems to be driving
this
wouldn't you say
if it's party affiliation does that mean
that anybody's opinion got changed by it
feels like no
right it feels like nobody's opinion got
changed
but
is your opinion the only thing that
makes a difference
well there's this other variable
called enthusiasm
do you think that the enthusiasm of the
democrats went up
because they watched the hearings
produce nothing like what they thought
did their enthusiasm go up
because they they drilled a dry hole
probably not
now let me ask you
some of you lean right
probably a lot of republicans watching
this
let me let me ask you about your
enthusiasm to vote
now that you know that people who look
and talk like you are being jailed for
nothing
through the roof
my enthusiasm to vote i don't even vote
but i've never wanted to more than i do
now
i mean i it's going to be a struggle not
to vote
i'm going to try i think i'll do it
i mean i think i'll succeed in not
voting because that's my personal
preference
because i think it biases everything i
do in public
but oh my god do i want to vote
i want to vote so hard right now
because i feel that i'm under attack
this feels personal the january 6th
thing to me is purely personal it
doesn't feel like politics ever felt
this feels like i'm being haunted
because i'm watching the people who look
like me that they've been hunted
and
i don't think that they're
if you can call it a mistake
i don't think the mistake they made is
that much different
than anything i've ever done in my life
right
or we all we're all big angels right
we've never done anything dumb
we've never done anything that was risky
we've never made a bad decision
all right
i'm watching people who are pretty much
just normal people trying to live a
normal life got a little excited one
weekend and now they're in
jail i could not i could not want to
vote more than that
i don't it's hard to imagine anything
that would make me more animated voting
because
the the deeply personal nature of this
is so different
like if you say
vote for this candidate because it'll
handle inflation better
i'll go yeah you know intellectually i
think that's true
i think i'll do something else instead
of vote
you know other people take care of it
like i'm not activated by inflation even
though i should be right
uh i'll do a better job negotiating with
china no you won't you're just lying
everybody's weak on china i don't know i
don't think that would get me to the
vote
i probably would vote for somebody who
said something about fentanyl that
wasn't as in i will attack
mexico
that would get me to the polls but
that's personal right
the reason i would be personally
activated to go to the polls over a
fentanyl is that i personally had a
tragedy in my family that involved
fentanyl
so that's why i'm motivated
it's personal right
and abortion is the same thing anybody
who's had some abortion situation and
they think that the change in the
supreme court
ruling
affects them that's personal
i do think people are going to vote
because of abortion that's really
personal
but this january 6 is really
personal to me
how many of you feel it personally
is that just me
like in the comments let me see all
right other people are saying yes
yeah
mostly and it's because they keep
showing pictures of people who look like
me and talk like me
and then they they talk about them in
jail
right now
can can we take a moment to stop
wallowing in self-pity here for a moment
and imagine what it's like to be black
just just just take a moment
because you just gotta you just got a
little taste of it didn't you you know
small small taste
this must be what it's like to be black
you see people who look like you being
rounded up and beaten like on the news
every day
what the hell are you going to think
about law enforcement if you turn on the
news and see people like you getting
rounded up and sent to jail
not good it's going to be pretty
personal right
so even though this january 6 thing
might feel terrible to you
take advantage of the new perspective it
gave you
and just just put a little thought of it
now i'm going to take you someplace you
didn't expect you ready
here here's where i'm going to really
 up your minds
you're on a journey today
so come with me on this journey
aoc and the crazy progressives have
wanted to
you know defund the police
and release all the criminals on no cash
bail what do you think of that idea
terrible right worst thing ever
even even democrats don't like it okay
now i'm going to support it
i'm going to make an argument for aoc
destroying the system
do you think i can do it
i'm going to make an argument i think
you can agree with
all right i'm going to talk about just
the no cash bill part all right so we'll
just limit it to no cash bail
how many of you think no cash bill is is
a good idea
in the comments how many of you agree
with letting people out without bail
bad right pretty much
all bad i thought i saw one yes go by
all right now i'm going to say
what is right about this
do you remember how many times i've told
you that what i liked about trump
is not what he was going to build
but what he was going to destroy
and if you don't destroy something first
you're never going to rebuild it you
can't tweak things into perfection
aoc and her crowd have said the justice
system is broken
and the only way to fix it is to break
it more
and letting the criminals out of jail
breaks
it breaks it because it takes the the
prisoners problem and it transfers it to
the people out of prison right
that's the thing you're complaining
about wait why is it my problem
i didn't break the law
no it's your problem too here's
why
you you non-lawbreaker
you are part of a system that largely is
designed to guarantee and i'll just pick
the black population as my proxy for
this
it pretty much guarantees that a huge
percentage of the black population will
be born and is pretty much guaranteed to
go into the
into the justice system and have a bad
life
now you say to yourself but it's also
not my problem to fix that
that's not my problem is it well yeah
that's your problem because you're
paying for jails and it's not fixing it
it's getting worse
so here's what i think aoc and her
people did and maybe george soros you
know i can't read his mind
can't read his mind
but they needed to break this more
to get it fixed now you say to yourself
but scott there's no way to fix
that
we had a fix it was called bail
why not just go back to what you had
well what we had guaranteed that a huge
percentage of our population would
become criminals
are you happy with that
let me suggest a way to fix
bail reform
i'll just put it out there
imagine you gave people who had been
accused of a crime but not convicted the
people who would go out on bail
typically you gave them two options one
is the old option
to get bail
the other option is not to be free on
the street unless it's a really minor
crime that's different but if you did
something violent let's say
your choice is to go is to put an ankle
monitor on
and to go live on a farm with the other
people who are also waiting for trial
but at any time you can also post bail
so you could you could leave there now
if you put
prisoners on a big old farm with lots of
space
and maybe they'd have some work to do
some trade that they could learn you
know if they wanted to maybe optional
they could work to learn to garden or
landscape and they could be it might
even be a working farm
and there'd be so much space that nobody
had to stand next to anybody if they
didn't want to
so you wouldn't have that many fights
because you could just say hey you just
stay away from each other you got you
got this whole farm just go outdoors
you know
and you could easily imagine
that no matter how dangerous that farm
was
it would be better for you
if these people were on the farm and
they could be accounted for now of
course you'd have security
yeah i'm not saying you don't have
security but it wouldn't be have to be a
solid wall because everybody would have
an ankle bracelet
and you'd have drones and you just round
them up if they leave
here's another thing you could just
change the law to say if they escaped
from the farm
that that would be entered as evidence
into the trial
that they're probably guilty
now here's the thing
if you if you lock somebody up and say
i'll give you bail what happens when
they get out where do they go
they go back to their crappy life
right
but if you say you're going to go stay
on this farm it's 20 miles away but so
is the jail
it's 20 miles away and it'll be actually
pretty good it'll be better than where
you live
and it's temporary
this is better than where you live it's
just until you go to trial and again you
can leave any time you want you just
have to post bail
so
imagine if living on the farm was
actually better than going home
now do you have a problem
do the democrats complain
if while you're waiting for trial you
didn't have a job but you're getting fed
you got health care and you got kind of
a good place to live
kind of clears your mind a little bit
you still get trial
you know you're still going to pay for
your crimes but let me ask you this
americans
all right so this one's just for
americans
this is to define who you want to be
and this is an important reframe
i'm going to write that one down i want
to put that one in my book
sometimes you're making a decision about
how to do things
and that's what it feels like most of
the time other times you're making a
decision about who you are
and that implies what you're going to do
like they're related
who do you want to be
do you want to be someone
who lets an accused but not convicted
person
accused but not convicted
should their life
be unpleasant
shouldn't it
you're accused but you have not been
convicted should the system make their
life unpleasant
no it should not
we're americans right
basic basic
basic
innocent until proven guilty you're not
you're not innocent until accused
you're innocent until proven guilty and
i would put as many murderers as it
takes in this beautiful farm
having an awesome time while they're in
trial i'll take that every day but the
minute they're convicted well you know
jail
but until they're convicted
we could give them a low-cost solution
that's less cost than jail because i
would think that putting somebody on a
farm and feeding them would probably be
less expensive than jail
right
so
let me let me just summarize and then
i'm going to ask you for your opinion
since we do not want to torture the
accused who have not been convicted
there is no reason that we cannot make
their situation
better
as opposed to worse right there's
nothing in our philosophy as americans
that prevent us from making the accused
have a pretty good few weeks
it's just not against the law it's not
against our principles it's not against
anything
an accused non-convicted person is just
as innocent as you are and while it's
not technically true
it's it's it's a fiction if you will
that holds us together it's a cohesive
necessary fiction
and i don't want to lose any of that
so as soon as you allow that it doesn't
matter if they're having a good day
even if they're accused of what horrible
things because they will go to jail if
they're convicted right
so
that's my
suggestion now the suggestion is first
draft
we can imagine that said farm is run by
a
a private prison company
so the same company that's losing all
its prisoners
to bail reform
the same companies say hey we're not
making as much money because there are
fewer prisoners
let them start the farm
and say how about if we build this
alternative thing
the the farm where you can hang out in
fairly good situations
until you're a child
because they can make money because
they'd be charging for the farm just
like they would be charging for the the
jail
dan's comment wow can this guy get any
worse
dan you piece of
let's let's get rid of your your
troll-like comments and you can go live
with the people who don't have reasons
for their opinions
so go yourself stick your head up
your ass
and you're gone
by the way if you have criticisms happy
to hear them as always
happy to hear all right so here's the
first point number one
my specific idea
should not be taken too seriously
and that was the problem with the guy i
just banned i think he he didn't
understand the concept here
a first draft of an idea is just sort of
directional and its only purpose
its only purpose
was to spur your creativity
so you could imagine a system
where you get everything you want
and so does aoc
that's not impossible
that's not impossible i just gave you
an idea that's pretty close like that
might not be the idea maybe somebody has
a better idea but here's what was useful
when you see somebody breaking a system
that actually needs to be broken
pay attention
please
all right when aoc is trying to break
your system you say no don't break my
my system because
it was working
sort of
that's not good enough
maybe she wants to break it to make it
work better
so
i think you should give a little bit of
respect
to the demolishers because they are very
productive or could be
right trump is a destroyer of bad ideas
he destroyed the fake news
that the entire news industry was
destroyed by trump and it's one of the
best things that ever happened because
we will rebuild something that's better
than the traditional news
we haven't found it yet
but it's coming something's coming
there there will be
alternative things that emerge because
the fake news is now so discredited
trump destroyed the news
i don't think that's going to turn out
bad in the long run i think we'll
rebuild better
to borrow a phrase
all right
um got a little quiet here how many of
you would be willing to accept my
general proposition without don't don't
accept the specific suggestion of the
prisoner form
you don't need to rule on that i want
you to accept my general proposition
that aoc might not be wrong
that breaking it is the first step to
doing anything useful
a little mixed a little mixed
yeah
interesting
all right
i i got more more agreement on that than
i expected actually
it looked i don't know based on the
comments
kind of mixed 50 50.
right well that's better than i thought
all right i think once again you would
agree with the following proposition
um the way i frame the news is not what
you're used to seeing
true
and is it useful that you see a
different frame on the news even if you
don't agree with it
because i'm not trying to make you agree
with me
that i don't do that
i mean i suppose there are times when i
do it but in general
i'm trying to i'm trying to make you see
it in more than one frame
because if you can see it in multiple
frames you know a different you know
window to look into it you're more
likely to come up with the right answer
just statistically the more windows you
look into
the more you know about the interior of
the home that's that's all that's it
i'm giving you a few extra windows to
look into the house if that helps you
that's great
but it's kind of up to you to do
something with it
yeah let's talk about the bizarre joe
biden video so there's there's a video
there's a you know side by side videos
allegedly of biden talking the same day
there's i think it's a morning and an
evening talk
the morning talk he looked normal
and actually
completely loosened
by the second one and i don't know if
they really
yeah i don't know if there's any chicane
chicanery i've never said that word and
i've never said that word out loud
chicanery
it sounds like cannery
uh so there there could be something
about the side by sides that's not real
you know it could be a deep fae it could
be cgi could be anything but the point
is
she cannery chicanery
thank you dwayne
i got my uh
yeah she
she catery
all right
got it
but uh
here's my question
if we took and sort of this is a
challenge to anybody wants to do this
if you do the timestamp of the time of
day that joe biden was giving any kind
of a public presentation
could you do all of the morning ones and
compare them to all the evening ones
and see if there's a difference
because
if i taught you nothing it's that
anecdotal evidence means nothing
so here you have him one speech one way
and another speech with another persona
but also the topic was different
one topic he was talking about how great
he's doing
he talked like a normal guy
and one topic he was you know insulting
trump again
and getting all angry about it because
he wanted you to be angry too
so it's not entirely clear he wasn't
intentionally changing his
his acting right to be more angry about
one but more calm about the other as
possible so i'd want to see if the if
the afternoon and evening presentations
are substantially different from the
morning
because it could be you'd find that
pattern in all of it
it might be a sundowner thing right
that's the thing we're worried about
that it's it's a dementia thing
and one was a non-blinking robot
oh one was definitely before he was sick
and one was after he was oh well
maybe
it was
it was presented as a same day thing but
that's the part i doubt
so i wouldn't believe the side by side i
retweeted it because it's fun
but i wouldn't believe it
uh somebody says it's a fact right lane
bandit says it's a fact that those
videos are real
maybe
i'm not i'm not ruling it out i just
think it's slightly unlikely
slightly unlikely i wouldn't rule it out
all right
one was edited to remove gaps maybe
i just have a funny meme of
biting on the on the zero cent stamp
looking like this
that's funny
all right on the the locals
platform i've asked my followers
who are full of memes to paste all their
memes in one of the posts
uh i might tweet that to the public if
you're nice to me
but i do think we needed one place where
all the good memes are
because i don't know about you but if i
watch a comedy on television or a funny
movie i might laugh a little bit
but if i watch you know two or three
memes
i'm usually laughing out loud
do you have that same experience that
the memes actually make me laugh out
loud
whereas in movies
sometimes
and i'll say again if you haven't seen
the bill burr special from red rocks
it's
it's a special special
is some
it might be his best work it's it's
pretty awesome
all right
that's all for now
and i'll talk to you youtubers and
spotifiers
tomorrow
