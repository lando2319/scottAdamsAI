hey everybody
you caught me a little bit behind the
times
i've got to get my studio in shape here
i'm printing off my notes
closing my blinds getting into full
coffee with scott adams mode a little
late because i want to put together a
little
white situation here
so i was doing that while you were
getting ready to come on live
and is this the best day ever we don't
know yet
but it might be it might be the best day
ever
good morning hey omar
thanks for uh joining me and wouldn't
you like to do
a little thing we call the simultaneous
up i know you would and all you need is
a cupboard bug or a glass of tanker
tails or stein a canteen jogger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous up and it happens
now go
excuse me while i grab my notes
thanks for waiting all right
well i would say the biggest story of
the day is those
doctors i thought you all know what i'm
talking about right so
there was a i guess breitbart filmed a
group of doctors who are
pro-hydroxychloroquine and they were
giving a little press conference
outside somewhere and they were talking
about
what they believed were the obvious
medical benefits of hydroxychloroquine
for fighting uh coronavirus now of
course they are not in the
well i don't know if they're in the
medical majority but maybe the
the the degree to which they trust the
hydroxychloroquine
might put them in the minority i think
there are other doctors who would say
well we don't know but
might be worth a shot so let me give you
my
uh full analysis of the doctors
now what makes the story interesting is
that facebook banned it
after it had i don't know 14 million
views
and then facebook banned it for giving
the wrong information
so it was bad medical information
according to facebook
i think today that twitter has banned it
am i right about that or not
i might be wrong about that i know that
twitter was waiting
but i saw a few clips posted this
morning that were blank
and i wasn't sure if that's twitter or
where it was being pointed to that
blanked it out
but so we have two stories in one
story number one is censorship
is it censorship if a
social platform takes incorrect
information
off its platform wait
wait you're going to say scott scott but
it wasn't
it wasn't wrong we're not talking about
that yet
so we'll talk about whether it was right
or wrong separately
the real question is does facebook get
to decide
why does facebook get to decide what is
correct
medical information now i think what
they do
is that they look at the doctors and the
fda and they look at the
world health organization and the cdc
and i imagine what they do is say well
if these people are making claims that
are outside of the experts
the experts say they're wrong who are we
to
you know argue but we're in this weird
situation in which the experts have con
been consistently wrong and in the case
of face masks
intentionally lying think about that
we're we're right in the middle of a
situation where the experts have even
admitted in terms of face masks they've
admitted
that they lied to us about a life and
death
medical situation now they had a good
reason
they had a good reason for doing it they
were trying to you know maintain the
supply so that the healthcare workers
could get it
and frankly that was a good reason if
they'd given us the good reason
i think maybe i could have acted
appropriately and said ah
i want to get that face mask maybe for
myself but i will
you know allow the n95s to be more
available but other people might not
so i don't even i don't even fault the
experts
for lying to the public in that case
because they had a higher
mission involved and you know you could
argue it but that's not something i care
about too much
the point is if we know that your
experts can lie to you
we don't have to wonder they just told
us
they said yeah we had a good reason so
we lied to you you don't have to wonder
if it's a thing anymore
it's now a thing they will lie to you
for a fact
because they think there's some greater
value there to somebody
so here's the here's my take on the
the medical part of it there's no right
answer
because you really can't run a country
where you can promote
bad information to people the way it's
being done
now i wouldn't object to facebook
tagging the the arguments to it
if they just said this has been tagged
as a suspicious or
non-confirmed medical opinion we're
going to tag it
so that you can't miss it and here's the
counterpoint
i'd be okay with that wouldn't you be
okay with
this is a controversial or unproven
medical claim
here's the counterpoint i
that would be okay with me now it would
still confuse some people because people
would still
buy into the less credible view but the
less credible view isn't always wrong
that's the problem
the less credible view just might be the
new
what will be the new mainstream
understanding later but it hasn't grown
yet
so it's a real it's a real tough one but
i would go with showing both sides that
would be where i'd
come out on this thing now let's talk
about the credibility
of the doctors um i would say none
none if if you thought those doctors
were credible
i'll tell you why i think they're not
and then you can
make your decision first of all how hard
is it to get i don't know 20 doctors
who are against the mainstream thinking
not hard at all
especially on social media i think they
said that they had met on social media
before getting together so having a few
dozen doctors who disagree with
anything is easy so what should you make
of the fact that there were a few dozen
doctors
who have a different point of view the
credibility you should put on that is
nothing
just nothing at all because you can get
20 people to say anything
especially if they're on the internet so
they can find themselves
because you'd only need what you'd need
one person
in every other state in the union
to get 25 people i mean it's a really
low bar
to get you know a dozen or 20 doctors to
say the same thing that's different from
the mainstream
so the fact that they are doctors and
they had doctor
coats on and they have doctor experience
you should count that as nothing
nothing so in your mental calculation
the weight you should give their
experience
in this specific case just nothing
because you could get somebody to say
anything
secondly let's look at the quality of
their arguments
i'm just i'm just going to say the thing
that everybody's thinking
but since it sounds racist you have to
say it carefully
because it's not racist the woman who is
the
the most featured in that was a doctor
who was
grew up and i guess she practiced in
nigeria before she came here
and i don't have to tell you that
nigeria is a company that is
a country that is famous for scams
if you say nigerian email what's the
first thing you think
it's not racist because nigeria just
happens to be a country there's nothing
about
nothing about being black in this story
so if you're hearing it you're hearing
the wrong thing
it's just a country but it's a country
that's famous by
brand for scams so when your main
doctor says you know i i practiced in
nigeria
what does your uncritical brain do it
just goes click
oh somebody from nigeria
and again has nothing to do with
ethnicity it's the country
the country is simply famous for scams
now that doesn't mean that this doctor
is therefore not credible it just means
that's how it feels
right so i'm going to separate the
things which are logical and you can
count on
from the things that you're just going
to feel and that's in the category of
things
well i'm feeling like there's some lack
of credibility but it's not
fair because it's not as if all doctors
coming out of nigeria have something in
common
they don't they don't but it feels that
way
so that's the first thing that works
against them but it has nothing to do
with whether they're right or wrong
the here's the part that really got to
me
so the same woman the the doctor whose
name i can't remember
said that she studied she had treated
350 patients
given them all hydroxychloroquine with
or without the other
combo i'm not sure and claims that none
of them have died
so nobody and of 350 people
who came in to her for treatment none of
them not one person in a 350 died
so that's credible right that's pretty
good information
that's somebody who's really living it
and doing it and working with
real people and if 350 of them came in
with this
and none of them died that's pretty
useful right i mean that tells you
something
does it no
no it doesn't tell you anything you
should have learned
exactly zero from that information
number one is it true is it true
you don't know do you know that she
treated 350 patients
with covet you don't know that you might
know you might know that she had 350
patients
who came in with some kind of a symptom
that she thought you know i don't know
the the tests take a long time they're
not available i'll just give you some
hydroxychloroquine
and i'll if you don't die i'm going to
count you as one of my cures
is that what happened i don't know you
don't either
we have no idea what happened we don't
know if they were correctly identified
or not
how about this and i'm just going to
throw this out there
would she know if one percent of her 350
people
had died would she know
i don't know maybe not i don't know if
she'd know or not
do doctors track each of their patients
so that they could tell you that
three weeks later they they died under
somebody else's care i don't know
were these all her own patients or are
they people who
just needed care and paid for it in cash
does she really know what happened to
her people
don't know next how hard
how unusual would it be if no people
died out of 350.
i don't know that it's that unusual
because here's what i'm thinking
if you have severe covet symptoms
where do you go do you go to your
general practitioner
or do you go to the emergency room
because if the only people that this
doctor
sees are the people who had such mild
symptoms they weren't even
quite sure if they were sick isn't that
the group that gets better anyway
that's the group that just gets better
on their own if all the people who
really felt like there was something
going on it was kind of advanced to the
point where they couldn't
breathe well or they had pretty bad
symptoms
they might go to the hospital first so
it's not clear that what she's seeing is
a broad
sample but rather the people who have
self-selected
for mild symptoms if they have
self-selected for mild symptoms
and she gives them the mild symptom
treatment
and every single one of them avoids
hospitalization
what have you learned nothing
i don't think you've learned anything
statistically you've learned that it's
maybe something you could look at
that's definitely enough to say well we
should study this
if what you took away from it is oh we
should look into this it's worth
putting some money into a rigorous study
yes
but if you're saying well we have the
answer now no
that's not even close to being credible
all right um
let's see and so there's the main thing
now
i have to tell you about this
conversation that i just had online
with uh there's a doctor that you might
be familiar with
dr eric feigl ding with a
um what do you call a hyphen feigl ding
is his last name and he's an
epidemiologist and health economist
senior fellow at harvard 16 years of
public health at harvard
he works on the covet task force
steering committee in the coved
updates and analyses so it's somebody
who
with a harvard degree lots of experience
and he works in this field
so that's incredible wouldn't you say a
very credible guy
but i tweeted at him and then then we
had some exchanges i won't go into the
details
but um i gave him some
advice and the advice is not medical
advice obviously
rather i gave him communication advice
and it it took an interesting turn
and here was my point that the people
who believe
hydroxychloroquine has potential
they generally believe that his
potential is limited
to early use as opposed to i'm already
in the hospital and i'm in bad shape
and there's a reason for that a very
specific reason which that by the time
you get in the hospital your medical
condition has changed to this
cyclotine storm or whatever i don't know
what i'm talking about
but the point of it is that the covent
progression
is two different phases the first one
where the
virus is growing which is where people
think the hydroxychloroquine with the
other two drugs
might be useful and then there's a part
where it turns into
a monster of a problem that's almost a
different problem
people do not believe largely that it
works in that
situation where you're near death that
has been tested
and tested a number of times now in
trials that look
like they would pick it up if it did
work and show that it didn't
so not only did they use too much of a
dose
on the people who were hospitalized a
dose that we would know would have some
side effects or expect but it was too
late it was the wrong use
in the wrong situation and in some cases
they didn't use the the three drugs
so i pointed out to
dr eric feiglding that when he
responds to people saying that hydroxyl
chloroquine might be useful
that when he responds to them we're
showing studies of the wrong
thing it makes him look less credible
not more credible in other words it
looks like somebody who's trying to scam
you
as opposed to someone who's trying to
help you let me be very careful in my
wording here
i'm not making an accusation that this
doctor or any doctor is trying to scam
you
it's a communication point if
if i say to you i think hydroxychloric
works
for an outpatient and you as the doctor
professional say
no it doesn't because we tested it on a
completely different set of patients
with a different situation who were near
death and had a different medical
problem
and it didn't work for them does your
credibility go
up or does it go down what goes down
right because because because what i
hear is how come you're not talking
about the thing i'm talking about why
are you giving me
studies about the wrong thing
so i mentioned this to the doctor and he
accused me of
cherry picking which was essentially
correct
is his accusation because i did cherry
pick out of a number of studies that he
had in his thread so i had picked one to
point out
why do we keep looking at the wrong
thing and he said
but you're also not looking at the other
ones i showed that were
outpatient one of them was an 800 person
outpatient study and then it goes
to this bringing in the white board
kind of turns into this
why are you looking at only the
hospitalized patients oh okay
if if that doesn't tell you the right
thing we don't have to look at them
anymore
but look at my studies of outpatient
that's what you wanted right you wanted
to see some outpatient stuff not
hospitalist
stuff so look at my study of
hydroxychloroquine being used alone
to which i say no that's not it either
i want to see and then and then the next
thing goes to is hydroxychloroquine with
one of the two things either zinc or
azithromycin
you've seen the doctors say that they
think it's one or the other or both that
might be the
key ingredient so i don't care about a
study
that only has one so what happened when
i pointed out to the doctor
eric feigl ding i pointed out to him
that the only three things that would
tell us
whether hydroxychloroquine in
combination
works for outpatient would be a study
that studied it
there's no study studying the only thing
that people wonder about
right the people who think
hydroxychloroquine might
work and i haven't given you my opinion
on this yet so hold on for that
but the people who think it might work
are very specific
no we didn't say it would work on the
near-death people
no we didn't say it would work alone no
we didn't say that
we know which one of the two things is
the magic some people do but they
shouldn't
we said the three of them together
give and early can you tell us if that
works
and you know what the answer is you
can't
so this is the dr feigl ding's
response was when i pointed out that the
very study that we
we would like to either debunk or
confirm
this assumption doesn't exist
he didn't say it does exist because it
doesn't rather
he pointed out how difficult it is to do
studies
and he pointed out that this would be an
exceptionally hard study because there
would be three drugs involved and you'd
have to follow them for a while
they're expensive it's something like 50
he mentioned there's something like 50
000
per person studied you would need
thousands of them
you'd want to do it fast it's really
hard
and then he mentioned that i don't quite
understand
the the field which is true of course
now what does this make you feel like
if your proposition is this the
hydroxychloroquine with these two drugs
might be good for outpatient only what
happens when somebody shows you the
wrong study
and you say that's the wrong study and
they show you another wrong study
you say that's the wrong study so they
show you another wrong study and you say
that's the wrong study
because this isn't really hard to
understand
give me the three things for outpatient
only
that's it that's all i want and then
once these three types of studies which
are the wrong study have been
debunked as being useful in this
conversation
it turns into it's hard to study things
well isn't that a reason to use it
it's hard to study is the reason to
prescribe it
because it's hard to study and the
upside benefit
would be if it worked and i'm not saying
it does
if it worked it would be incredible
right it would be incredible
so given that the risks at the very
small
dosage that these doctors on this banned
video we're talking about
they're talking about a pill or two
every week something like that
i mean a really low dosage as a
prophylactic
and again it hasn't been studied as a
prophylactic
in a way that shows it works
so i have to ask you
what is your impression of somebody who
would take you through the argument in
this direction
by only misdirection but so my
conversation with
doctors who are anti-hydroxychloroquine
and others
always follows the misdirection path
you can't really get them to talk about
the thing that you need to talk about
they want to talk about other stuff why
is that
now uh here's how i left
my conversation with dr feigelden
i said that i obviously i agree that
would be hard to do the studies
i'm just pointing out that they don't
exist and therefore we
can't make a conclusion about something
that hasn't been studied
uh somebody says there's a lot of rumors
about dr fauci
having once been in favor of hydrox
chloroquine for coronaviruses in general
um but i haven't looked into that to
know if that's true or not
and then some people are asking whether
fauci himself is on hydroxychloroquine
which would be a real interesting
question we'll never find that out
i don't think but it is an interesting
question
um here's what i would settle for
if we can't have a study and i want you
to see how much trouble this will get me
into okay
so i'm going to say something very
unscientific
and all of you should be smart enough to
know what's wrong with it
all right if you can't tell what's wrong
with it you haven't been paying
attention
here is what would make me happy tell me
how many people
have gotten the three drugs not just
hydroxychloroquine
but all three the zinc and the
azithromycin two
how many people got them as outpatients
and then later died because i'll bet we
could find that out
could we find that anybody has ever died
taking these three drugs early like ever
has anybody ever died do you know the
answer that
i don't because these doctors
yesterday in this band video were
claiming that it's
they even used the word cure which is i
think why they got banned
but don't you think that we could
without doing a formal study could we
not at least know that one piece of data
is that is that discoverable without
without resort to uh you know
formal study if we have the death
certificate do we also know how soon
before the death
which would tell us if they got it early
enough do we know how soon before the
death
they had all three drugs in their system
you know it would it be on the records
because if you told me
scott we've looked and we haven't found
anybody who's ever died
if they got this prior to
hospitalization
and they took all three what if it's
zero
right now if you had if you had to make
me bet
i would bet it's not zero i would bet
you know at least people who had
comorbidities would die maybe there are
plenty
there could be hundreds of thousands
i don't know but wouldn't you like to
know if hundreds of thousands of people
who took the three drugs in combination
early as outpatient
wouldn't you like to know if even one of
them died
even one you don't know that do you
tell me how many died and let me decide
if that matters to me so let's say for
example
that we could find that information or
we could find it at least statistically
from let's say one hospital
but somebody says yes fda did a study
no they didn't no they didn't
but here's the thing maybe just one's
hospital
if they could study just their patients
if there were enough of them
and that tell us did even one
die with these three drugs in them and
if so was there anything
comorbidity-wise that we should know
about that person
but um here's my bottom line
it is obvious that there's
either by intention or by mistake
we are being misled on how to look at
this
which is different from me saying oh
this is a great drug you should all be
taking it
how the hell would i know i'm not a
doctor don't take my medical advice
i'm just saying that the way this is
being presented to us
is as a fraud would present it which is
not to say that the people involved are
frauds
it's just saying that the way it's being
presented is the way you would present
it
if you were trying to defraud somebody
it would look exactly like this
so if you're in a situation that looks
exactly like a fraud
doesn't mean it is this time could be
that everybody's telling you the truth
it just doesn't feel like it if i'm
being honest it doesn't feel like it
all right um
i spend most of my time looking at that
thing so
here's some other things going on in the
world i told you that the biggest factor
in
trump's re-election would be something
completely outside his control
which is what happens to other countries
who got a handle on coronavirus early
my assumption has been that since there
is no
there's no workable vaccine yet and
nobody's really that close to herd
immunity i doubt anyway
i don't know that but i don't think herd
immunity is too close
my assumption was that between now and
election day
the countries that have done such a good
job because they're so smarter
and their leaders are so better and
they're way better than
me and old orange man bad that they
would instead of them
doing a good job and then just taking it
to the finish line
it seemed almost guaranteed
from what we know about the virus it
seems almost guaranteed
that the other countries are going to
have the same experience we did
which is you get a handle on it then you
try to loosen up
then you have to get a handle on it
again then you try to loosen up so
we're already seeing the first headline
of this in cnn
quote from cnn this morning even
countries that got coronavirus under
control
are now struggling that's deeply
concerning for the rest of the world
that sentence says trump gets reelected
100 percent
i'll read it again just listen to the
sentence and then even try to imagine
that trump would not get a reelected
here's a sentence even countries that
got coronavirus under control are now
struggling that's the election
that's it that's the whole election
right there because if the other
countries
with all their wisdom and not burdened
by an orange man bad
if they have some kind of average
experience and we're somewhere in the
average
all it's going to show you is that
leadership didn't matter
that's all it's going to show you
leadership didn't really matter
and i think that's where we're going to
be
now here's another thing that was
predictable yet funny
the the black people in portland were
protesting are feeling there's a
little lack of clarity about what the
protests are about these days
because apparently the white people who
have completely taken over the black
lives matter protest
you know i swear i can say this because
of a white person
do white people ruin everything like is
there any exception
if black people get anything going
that's good isn't there going to be some
white person that comes in and just
freaking ruins it
i gotta say if there's one complaint
that black people make all the time that
i that i just you know i just
nod my head like oh yep you're right on
that one i might argue about some other
stuff but
now anytime black people do something
good
white people will come in and ruin it
it's so consistent
and it looks like that's what's
happening with the protest i think if
the protest had
stayed with you know the george floyd
thing it stayed a
black people trying to make the world
better white people helping them out
you know supportively that could have
been a good thing but it looks like
antifa
just hollowed them out and you and he
was using them as a
you know a disguise for whatever they're
trying to do to
take over the country i guess so
i believe that we could we could predict
at this point that the
white and black protesters who believed
they were on the same side are soon
discovering
they are not so much on the same side
anymore
somebody somebody's asking me in the
comments will you take the vaccine
well there's not the vaccine there are
vaccines
i saw a clip in which bill gates was
being asked about
i guess one of the first vaccines i
figure which one maybe moderna
but that it has a pretty
pretty hard side effects because the
dosage is pretty high
now if the first vaccine that's
available
has known side effects meaning you're
definitely going to get a side effect
and it's ugly i might wait
i might wait so i don't have to answer
your question i would need to know a
little bit more
about the first one that's available
i wouldn't rule out taking it i wouldn't
rule it out
but i'm not 100 there yet i'd need to
know a little bit more
if it's knowable now the other thing
that's going on with the protest
slash looting slash
violence is the the question of whether
it's violent or non-violent now you've
seen probably by now the
the videos of uh uh jerry nadler
being asked if the protests are violent
and he says they're not
and then they've cleverly put the scenes
of all the fires and
the protest stuff in the background now
i don't know that it's useful to argue
about whether they're violent or
non-violent because it's clearly
mostly non-violent people with a core of
violent people and everybody agrees with
that
so whether you want to call that
non-violent or call it violent is really
just
the word you're putting on it it's not
really helping anybody's understanding
but clearly there are people trying to
overthrow the country
and they say that directly i don't think
there are many of them
and i'm not terribly worried that they
will succeed in overthrowing the country
i do think that some of these cities
have very weak mayors
and that they just don't have a solution
for what you do about the federal
courthouse etc
but um the most amazing thing that's
happening about all this
uh if if we could maybe take a moment
to uh to show appreciation
for how unviolent the police and dhs
have been
because i don't know if i would have the
same level of
restraint as the police that we're
seeing
they are really really restrained you
know of course you're going to see the
video of somebody
you think went a little too far but as a
rule
the the law enforcement in every form
that's
handling these things they're doing a
really good job like
like an a plus job in my opinion now of
course you'll have your incidents
individual incidents that are imperfect
but overall
am i wrong overall i would say that the
that the law enforcement including dhs
are not just doing a good job i mean it
looks like they're doing
really good job like really good job
like is
one of the best jobs you've ever seen
anybody do a job
and here's why i say that they have
limited
the damage now to certain blocks
so that's good so you know it's not
growing it's it's now
re constrained they did it without
causing
revolution in other words it would have
been easy to overreact
a number of them are being blinded
intentionally blinded by lasers
if somebody intentionally blinds you
um or let's say let's say somebody
intentionally blinds your partner right
next to you
and you see where i came from in my
opinion you should be able to shoot to
kill
because a laser attack on somebody's
eyes
maybe not legally is is a lethal force i
don't know how you define that but
trying to blind somebody
i can i can get where you say it's not
technically lethal
but in my opinion it should be the death
sentence
blinding somebody with a laser should be
the death sentence
if you did it intentionally um so the
restraint of all these people
is just incredible they're being hit in
the heads with with
objects have you seen the amount of
solid objects that are flying toward
them
and they they just are taking it it's
amazing
amazing and you know you don't take it
you don't take a moment
to kind of put yourself in the heads of
these other people and say how hard was
this
remember they in portland it's been 60
days of this
how many of those police officers have
been out there for much of
that entire 60-day period having stuff
thrown at them
do you know how much ptsd you would have
if you went out every night and solid
objects were whizzing past your head
and you're watching your your co-workers
go down blinded
you know concussions and every day you
go out there and do that again
and nobody's asking you to fight back
they're asking you to take it
incredible incredible
so a little uh
little applause for the law enforcement
people
now of course as you know the the bad
protesters are trying to get some
violence going
because that will work for their cause
but the longer the law enforcement
people can hold the the line
the longer that doesn't work and you
know you can
maybe decrease their energy over time
it hasn't happened as quickly as i hoped
but
but uh i think it's happening all right
somebody says serious bodily injury is
typically enough for
lethal self-defense but you know that's
generally true but serious bodily injury
is usually in the context of it could
have killed you
right if if somebody stabs you and you
didn't die
you know obviously that would be a case
where you could shoot them if they were
trying to stab you or already had but
that's the case where you could have
died
in the case of the laser there really
isn't any chance you could die
it is just grievous bodily injury so
it's weird in that sense
you know you wouldn't bleed out per se
so i don't know what the law would say
about that
uh no reports on daytime troop relief
yeah we don't know too much about
how often they're being relieved but i
don't think you could assume that any of
them are going to be mentally
the same after this is over how many
days could you be
outdoors at night with people throwing
hard objects at you
and you only have to be looking in the
wrong direction to be
basically have your braids scrambled
it's pretty bad
all right um
let's uh let's brain brainstorm about
what it would take for trump to get
reelected you ready
what would it take for trump to get
reelected well i think the economy
uh probably is not going to be a full v
because if things don't reopen there
won't be enough new jobs
so i think you're going to see the
economy improved
but stalled in terms of jobs
i think you're going to see the
republicans being a little cheap
on the relief package for people i think
that will hurt them
but maybe not with the people who are
necessarily going to vote
so it might not hurt them that much
oh the a.g bar hearing is starting
pretty soon and that's going to be
amazing so here's what i think trump
should do
to improve his chances number one avoid
an obvious mistake right because at the
moment
i think he's on a glide path to victory
because until uh until joe
biden has a vice president there isn't
going to be much of a target there
and whoever he picks as vice president
will probably hurt him
that's the funny part about it no matter
who he picks
it's going to hurt him because it's
going to be a new person who has a new
set of targets
like it's somebody who did something
wrong some something that even democrats
don't like
it'll be there trust me whoever he picks
so
going after biden is kind of a hard
challenge for trump because biden does
not seem
up to the task and it feels like you're
beating a baby
harp seal it doesn't feel like a fair
fight there's something about it that
just doesn't feel right because biden is
so degraded
if that changes then maybe trump could
go harder at him but as long as he's
looking feeble and hiding in his
basement trump can't do what trump does
best
which is go hard against somebody you
hate
one of the best things that trump had
going for him when he ran against
hillary clinton was hillary clinton
because
no matter how excited you were about
fighting voting
for trump weren't you also a little bit
excited about voting
against hillary that was a twofer
you could get trump but you could also
hurt hillary if he didn't like hillary
but there are any i don't think i've
heard
i can honestly say i've heard zero
people
searching my memory i've heard zero
republicans say that
they want to vote against biden meaning
that there's something wrong with him
in particular now of course some people
don't want his
mental situation in the job and some
people don't want a democrat
but you don't hear the talk like you
heard about hillary
hillary clinton was hated hated
individually
now some are going to say it's because
she was a woman i don't think so
i don't think that's why i think there's
some personalities that attract hate
the way that trump attracts hate from
the left it's just it's just the same
thing
it's not a gender thing um
but biden doesn't do that biden does not
make us hate him
i actually kind of like biden could
could
i hang out with biden and have a good
time
probably probably even people on the
other side
say this all the time they say he's a
good man
so that really takes the biggest club
away from trump which is he would love
to be just pounding on biden every day
and having his audience love it because
it's like ah
did you see what he did to biden today
but it doesn't
feel as good as when he would go after
hillary
when you heard crooked hillary it made
you happy because you knew it made her
sad
right there was a little bit of shot and
freud in there if you hear
the president say something that would
be devastating for biden to hear
let's say something about his mental
decline that's got to hurt
it's got to hurt it doesn't feel as good
does it
so he needs a vice president so there's
a so there's a stronger target
and it will give trump something to work
with so maybe that'll make a difference
i think as i said this coronavirus if it
gets in if it
gets out of control in other countries
it will make trump look better
and that will matter a lot and then you
know they're all these wild cards
what if what if it turned out that
hydroxychloroquine actually works
what if it does you know i'll give you
my current estimate
based on what we know at the moment 50
chance sort of a 50 50
that it would make some difference um
because as i say the studies are not
conclusive
but neither are they dismissive um so
i think trump also has the opportunity
to do a bunch of things
that are let's say counter factual
to the rumors about him so here are some
things
and these are really important and
they're in the category of the dog not
barking
so these are the things he's not doing
that are important in the ones that he's
doing so one of the things he's doing
that's important
is that he can do things like the
executive orders
for lowering drug costs so trump can go
into elections saying
i just did these executive orders and i
lowered your drug costs
now let's say he succeeds i don't know
if he will but it looks like it's a good
shot
if he succeeds he's going to be going
into the election
with health care success he should claim
also
the telehealth across state lines
and he should take some accomplishments
now biden of course
will be fighting with his own team who
says anything short of universal
healthcare
single-payer is not good enough so biden
won't even have an argument that his own
side
completely likes at the same time the
trump is going to say
well you guys keep arguing i just
lowered your drug costs
it's going to be a pretty strong
argument so he should look good on
health care he's going to look good on
immigration
because people are thinking about it
differently now in coronavirus
times i think that the george floyd
stuff has discredited very much
i think it discredited the people trying
to discredit president trump
meaning that um that the black lives
matter people
by teaming up with marxists by teaming
up with antifa
have discredited that whole thing and
and
as we watch the cities on fire at least
small parts of things on fire
it just doesn't feel good doesn't look
right and it makes trump
look stronger so every day that there's
a new protest
trump gets stronger in the public
because they like law and order
now trump has been weak with the law and
order
i'm sorry he's a week with the i guess
the suburban moms
what is it that suburban moms like more
than
law and order not many things
so the group that will be most concerned
about this lack of law and order
should be the very group that he wants
to attract
i would be surprised if the president
doesn't take advantage of
packaging up all the hoaxes and trying
to convince democrats
that their view of the world is hoax
determined
in other words he talks about the the
russia collusion hoax a lot
but i think it's powerful when you uh
when you put them together
so he could say look you believe the
russia collusion hoax you believe
it's hard for him to say this because it
would cause more trouble but i can say
it
you believe the fine people hoax you
believe
the ingesting
disinfectants hoax and you can go right
down the line
of all the hoaxes and i think that the
more it's pointed out how many hoaxes
have defined the democrat point of view
that you can at least give them some
uncertainty
about their news sources which might
help a little bit
so i think you'll be good enough on the
economy compared to biden
good enough on health care compared to
biden who won't have a
good coherent plan that everybody likes
i think you'll be good enough
on race weirdly
because i think all this the race riot
stuff
backfired
and i think that whenever biden gets a
vice president he will be weakened
by it because he'll be somebody who
doesn't like that vice president on his
own team
so and everybody will think the vice
president is going to be the president
anyway
so that won't matter um
your comments are all over the board a
bong is a stoner's best friend
okay that totally goes into our topic
uh
i don't bet on it hide your club i'm
just looking at your comments
the hydro hydrochloric
hydrochloroquine hoax will bust this
baby wide open
i don't think that we're going to know
if hydroxychloroquine works or doesn't
by election day
do you
[Music]
i think the president might do something
shocking on
immigration maybe more shocking than
he's done
to just to get his base fired up that
might happen yeah you can actually hear
my dog snoring can't you
the red pill about the media i don't
know if people are
ready to understand that the thing they
thought there
was the news is not the news i've had
this conversation
with one of my smartest and most well
informed friends
who buys him to completely the new york
times
cnn npr view of the world and
i tried to i tried to explain to him
that he's living in the past a past when
those news sources
could be trusted to give you something
closer to
an objective view of the world but he
doesn't understand
that we don't live in that world anymore
and that the news is literally just
propaganda at this point and
and he's believing the propaganda just
the way he believed the news back when
it was something like news
somebody says my liberal boyfriend is
coming around to the hoaxes
you know the hoaxes are the most i think
the hoaxes are the most
um brittle part of the
of the left's bubble once you point out
how many hoaxes
have informed their entire world view
it's got to start to chip away a little
bit just a little bit
oh this can't be true somebody's saying
in the comments
then nadler was in a car accident and so
the bar
hearing is delayed is that true can
somebody confirm that
because that would be the weirdest thing
in the world
set up the border catapults be nice
all right hearing is delayed nadler's
involved in a car accident well i guess
we'll have to find out about that
tariffs against china for climate
justice well you know i think the china
situation
is also incredibly good for trump right
now
because i i can't think of a better
contrast if you looked at you've got joe
biden
who you think is a little too close to
china right
at the same time that china has gone
from
uh friendly adversary if i could say
that a frenemy if you will
somebody that we want to do business
with to somebody that we can't trust
whatsoever
and are going to try to do less business
with and are intentionally or
entering a cold war with i think the
country's mood
either is or will be so anti-china
partly because the coronavirus so
anti-china
that the anti-china candidate is going
to look like the right choice
and that's trump now when i say
anti-china
it's the best possible situation
because trump was so
pro-she and pro-trade deal
so in a sense trump became nixon goes to
china if you will
sort of the reverse of that so nixon
you know the famous nixon went to
china's story he was the hardest
voice against china so if he could go
and be their friends
that meant it was okay because he was
the hardest voice against them
so his team would say all right all
right if you're if you're okay with them
i guess we can
at least talk to them trump did the
opposite
trump went in with the i'll be your
friend i'll show you full respect
we can both get rich this will be great
let's work together
hand in hand and then
it didn't work so trump has showed us
that the nixon goes to china doesn't
work he proved it
he proved it by giving them every
benefit of the doubt
working with them legitimately seriously
trying to really make something work
and then finding out it doesn't and that
they were wildly stealing our
intellectual property
even right now that's why the houston
consulate got closed
the chinese consulate because they had
stolen so much intellectual property
allegedly so trump is just a hundred
percent right
on china it looks like it
he was right to try it the way he did
and he was right to find out for sure if
that could work or not and he does now
now he found out we would not have
gotten that with biden
so he's better on china i think he's
he's
basically he's better on everything
except climate change and he has a kill
shot for climate change
if he uses it do you know what the kill
shot for climate change is
that even biden is in favor of nuclear
energy
that's pretty much the whole argument
trump will be running against
a candidate who is also in favor of
nuclear energy
that's it that's the whole argument
right there you could take
climate change right off the right off
the table
um
somebody says it's easier to accept a
lie than to accept you or lied to
yeah that is that's another way to
explain
cognitive dissonance i suppose
somebody says in the comments no one can
say that trump did not give
she every opportunity to salvage the
situation that's exactly right
and he did that really really well he
really gave china every opportunity
to be a you know a credible
good player and they did not take it
at least that's the version we hear in
america who knows if that's accurate
i also am wondering
here's somebody in the comments i have
to block here
so cynthia in the comments says scott
has had three months of reporting
the hydroxychloroquine works and today
is backpedaling on it
now i'm going to block you because i
block anybody who misrepresents
my opinion in public all right so that
so i have only ever said
that there is a percentage chance that
hydroxychloroquine is a game changer
and i've raised that from 30 to 50 to 70
depending on the news as it trickled
down so my view is that i don't know
but i know it's not been studied so
that's my view
and if it's not been studied then you
could use your
risk management judgment which doctors
are
to prescribe it or not so you have
grossly mischaracterized
my opinion of saying that i've reported
that it works
because i've never once done that and
now you are
consigned to the blockbin of history
um somebody says legalize cannabis
and i'll vote for trump well of course
legalizing it at the federal level would
not be enough
but if i were trump i would release
every person
on a federal marijuana charge
i would just do that between now and
election day because there's no way
that's wrong
it just isn't now a lot of those
marijuana charges might be
things that were pled down from more
serious charges so that might be a
little
little sticking point there but
i don't even understand why trump is not
active in taking marijuana off the
debate because it's just free money if
if he doesn't do it
probably the democrats will or have i
think that's in their platform
yeah there's a weird story about seeds
being sent from china with no
packaging as if maybe if we planted
those seeds something bad would happen
i don't know if we know what those seeds
are yet
somebody says will i be blocked for not
caring about your opinion
sure i'll block you for not caring about
my opinion
sometimes you can get your way that
easily
you always said 50 or less pretty
consistently yeah
how many debates will actually be held i
would say zero i don't think there will
be any
debates
um why did china not take the
opportunity i believe
but i'm not an expert my understanding
is that china doesn't see the world
as a win-win scenario meaning that
in a deal you know the typical western
idea
of a good deal is where you both win i
win and you win
what i'm told and i'm not i'm not an
expert here so don't take it from me
is that the current chinese government
point of view is that
the chinese have to eventually dominate
the world
and that it's sort of more of a
hitlerian
kind of situation so why didn't hitler
make a good deal with
neville chamberlain because it was never
the point
the you know any deal that hillary made
was only just
a military technique to you know to
put your guard down it appears and
that's what's being reported
i'm not in anybody's head and i'm not an
expert in china so you shouldn't take my
word for any of this
but the reporting is that china wants to
dominate
sees its future that way and doesn't
have any interest
in a deal that isn't just good for them
and bad for us
so that's the proposition
what's my guess on the seeds my guess on
the seeds is it's
some kind of a crazy person situation or
marketing
i think the odds of the seeds being some
kind of a terrorist
attack are low but not
zero
one excuse to cancel the debates the
usual just
no crowds i think that trump would have
been
really weakened uh if he had gone ahead
and held his convention
holding the convention would have been a
huge mistake under the current
uptick um yeah
zero sum is the phrase i should have
used for
for china's opinion they they think that
some for somebody to win somebody has to
lose
yes my my nose operation is still
scheduled for tomorrow so
with any luck you will not hear my
whistling sinuses
and bad conditions but we'll see
so i should tell you that i don't know i
might do a periscope before i head off
for surgery
i haven't decided yet
your comments are funny those of you are
listening to this on podcast i'm sorry
uh all right thank you and uh
i will see you tomorrow maybe and the
day after
well i don't know about the day after i
may not be able to wake up
if you don't see me on periscope for
two days might be longer i'll
at least tweet out my status but you
should assume that i'm doing well
okay good and i'll talk to you as soon
as i can
