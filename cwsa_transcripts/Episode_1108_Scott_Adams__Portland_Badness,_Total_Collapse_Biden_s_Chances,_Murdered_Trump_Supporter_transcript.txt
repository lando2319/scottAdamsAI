hey everybody
come on in yeah i know it's sunday and
most of you should be in church
but it could be enough of you here
to enjoy the simultaneous sip and enjoy
it you will
it's the only thing that's almost as
good as church
i was going to say better but i don't
want to start a fight on a sunday
so i'll say almost as good
and all you need to enjoy the
simultaneously well you don't need
much that's the beauty of it all you
need is a copper margaret glass of
tanker chelsea's fine a canteen drug
flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure that dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
except the protests in portland
apparently nothing helps those
it's called the simultaneous hip and
habits now go
good stuff
well um i just saw a tweet from
jake novak who was saying it's
9 35 a.m on sunday and uh
real clear politics still hasn't
published the results of the blockbuster
new
di poll i don't know what the dipole is
showing trump in the lead that came out
at 10 pm last night
so there is some suggestion that the
polls have turned
just dramatically for trump now
if they hadn't turned dramatically for
trump
recently i would be quite surprised
but apparently there's some hesitation
to even print the polls
the polls are so big are so bad that
they won't even print
them so that's pretty bad
and funny at the same time now
there was a tragic shooting last night
in portland
and i would like to do something that
you rarely see
and this will be so rare that some of
you will remember when you saw it for
the rest of your life
you know sometimes when there's some big
event you'll be you'll be like i always
don't remember what i was doing
when that happened and here's the the
rare and special thing i'm going to do
i'm going to be consistent
in public i know i know it's crazy
you don't think i can do it watch this
watch this consistency yesterday i said
that people who resist the rest
they're the problem and that the media
has convinced us it's a police problem
police could do better everybody could
do better at anything they're doing
so that's a general statement but it's
mostly a resisting
arrest problem if you look at it that
way and so
i was showing not too much sympathy
for the people resisting arrest because
they were clearly inviting the problems
they got
if you invite a problem and then the
problem comes in
because you invited the problem and you
knew you were inviting the problem
and the problem was exactly the problem
you knew you were inviting
and now you have a problem i don't have
any sympathy for you
none i don't have a bit of sympathy for
you
last night apparently there was somebody
who knew he was going into a kill zone
dressed like somebody that is trying to
get killed
do i have sympathy for the trump
allegedly we don't know the story yet
but allegedly there's some blue lives
matter or trump supporter
who went right into the middle of a
violent crowd that was
armed and looking to kill people like
him
people like him here's my consistency
i'm not going to tell you that i don't
care about those resisting arrest people
regardless of color it has nothing to do
with
you know ethnicity white person black
person it doesn't matter if they're
resisting arrest
i just don't have sympathy for them
don't ask me to
if somebody goes consciously and
willingly into the most dangerous place
they could possibly go
and a bad thing happens to them don't
ask me for sympathy
don't ask me for any sympathy do you
think i'm gonna
do you think i'm gonna give empathy to
this guy because he was a trump
supporter
or because he was anti-anti-whatever he
was anti
anti the protesters i don't know
whatever he was
i just can't go there i just can't give
you any sympathy
for somebody who brings knowingly brings
a problem on themselves
i've got enough problems of my own i
don't have too many problems actually
that's sort of a lie i don't have a lot
of big problems
but there are certainly enough problems
of people who are good people who are
not trying to get into any trouble
who just need a little you know extra
boost somehow
i'm happy to help those people those
people deserve my empathy
i'd rather use empathy than sympathy in
this case
and i'll see what i can do see how i can
help
but if you're bringing trouble on
yourself don't ask
me to be unhappy about it ever
alright so that's what it looks like to
be consistent in public
you may never see it again so remember
where you were you were watching my
periscope when it happened
so we don't know a lot about this person
who is shot
we think we think just for being a trump
supporter or a or a blue lives matter
supporter which means
to the protesters they would have
defined that as a white supremacist
there's no evidence that he was
or wasn't there's just no evidence on
that um
so that's a we're still in the fog of
war on that
um governor k brown
uh oh so here's what else happened
so apparently there were 150 people with
gas masks and helmets
i think those were the protesters not
the counter protesters
remember i was saying that why is it
that we don't hear about the number of
protesters
hasn't been odd to you why don't we ever
hear the number of them
sometimes they say well it's in a small
it's you know just in a few blocks
and they talk about the real estate but
they don't really talk about the number
of them
and you don't hear it on the media from
the left you don't hear it on the media
from the right
and you don't even hear from all the
independents you know like andy no etc
who are showing up
now maybe i'm missing it that's possible
i mean maybe it's being reported and
just by coincidence
everywhere i look i don't see it but you
don't know do you
in the comments tell me if you know how
many people show up for
any of these protests i have no idea let
me tell you why this is so important
let's say it's 150 people who were
clearly identified as protesters
is that the right number i don't know
but if there's 150
what does that tell you about the
solution
it tells you the solution is really easy
because 150 people is not many people
for a protest you know that you could
certainly
round up enough law enforcement so you
outnumbered them
if you wanted to could you not find 150
law enforcement people
but here's the more dangerous thought
not a recommendation
i'm not recommending this but it's it's
easy to imagine where things are going
to go
on their own whether i recommended it or
discouraged it wouldn't matter it's
going to happen on its own
and that is if it's only 150 protesters
and they're actually destroying the
entire
city you know not the whole city at once
but they're
they're sort of chewing away and
breaking a new storefront every night
and
it's never going to stop at some point
the people who are not happy with this
will organize
and they will say all right how many of
us does it take
to get rid of them there are only 150 of
them
and they're not that big could
you know could the counter protesters
every single night of the year come up
with more than 150 counter protesters
to shut them down again i'm not
recommending this
i'm just saying this is a likely outcome
so if the reporting told us the number
of people
we would also know what the solution
looked like
or we would be able to predict what
would happen
you know you wouldn't call it a solution
if the counter protesters come there to
get into a fight
that would just be a different problem
but you can kind of predict where it's
going if you knew how many they were
and also if you knew if that number was
growing or shrinking
recently you know what's it look like
the last 10 nights of protests
exactly same number a little bigger
bigger on weekends what's it look like
no reporting on that of course
but i guess there were a bunch of pro
police
people that might have been pro-trump at
the same time who
decided that going into the middle of
this craziness was a good idea
now if you didn't see the videos of the
trump supporters in
big trucks with their flags not all of
them went through the middle of the
the protest but some of them did i think
most of the protesters decided to drive
around
portland but some decided to go right
through the middle
looking for trouble and you see these
trump supporters sitting in the back of
trucks with
at least in one case i don't know how
many others with a paint gun
paintball gun and you'd see the
protesters throw an
egg or something and then you see the
trump protest
the trump guy in the truck who's
literally just
sport hunting with a paintball gun
he's sport hunting you just look at him
and it's obvious
he came there for the sport and he's got
his paint gun he's just like pop up up
up up up
nobody got hurt i don't think you know
probably stung
got some paint on him i don't think
anybody got hurt i hope not
but um it's obvious
at least that small group of the
protesters that didn't represent
all the all the counter protesters but
that small group
quite obviously came there for the fight
club
they came there for the entertainment
and do i feel sorry for anybody they
shot with a paint gun
nope don't everybody chose to be there
under exactly the circumstances that
they experienced
they were all adult conscious choices
mostly adult i guess
so that was predictable that it would
turn into a fight club
and it did the real question is now do
the counter protesters enjoy it enough
that they go back and i gotta tell you i
for the for those of you who are
watching this who
are uh either women i'm gonna make a
gross general
generality are you ready for this you
can tell me if this is
sexist or not all right and i will
accept your condemnation
if you say scott that's a little bit
sexist i will accept that that
classification but here's what i'm going
to say
men and women don't quite think the same
and women don't really have any idea how
dark
men can be you don't know
because men are largely killers who have
been
socialized you know we're we're
basically killers
we're killers of animals in order to
hunt
and eat we're killers of the other tribe
the other country
were basically killers who sometimes do
some you know procreating and
protecting the you know the people
involved in procreation
but we're kind of murderers at our base
now are gross generalizations accurate
no no that's why they're gross
generalizations
i don't mean to suggest that each of the
men watching this are murderers
or even trying to suppress it i'm just
saying that compared to women
we're a little bit more willing to pull
a trigger
it's sort of baked into a lot of our dna
not everybody everybody's
different and and i even
i even completely accept that there are
more categories than men and women i
know most of you don't
but i'm completely open with people
being whatever they want to be
if it doesn't bother me so
um here's the thing when i watched
those trump supporters paintballing the
crowd
and then also when i watched the crowd
getting all excited about destroying
stuff
and burning things i said to myself
if you're a woman and you're watching
this this all looks bad
like it's nothing but bad from bottom to
top there are no good people there
it's just bad bad bad again
gross generalization plenty of women
would disagree with this
and i i understand but if you're a man
i probably shouldn't even admit this
because this this is not
something anybody could be proud of
it's just sort of a truth a lot of men
could watch those videos of the
paintballing and the egg throwing and
the fires
and say to themselves i wouldn't mind
having a little bit of that
now not most men you know it's going to
be
less than half but i'll bet
more than half said to themselves i can
see why that would be fun
i wouldn't personally do it i'm not
going to put myself in that amount of
danger for
no particular benefit that i can see but
i can see
that that guy sitting on the back of the
pickup truck who was
just shooting paintball at people he
didn't like
with complete impunity there was no law
there
no law it was a police-free zone
in which anybody can go there's a
scheduled event
that's basically fight club people go
there to fight
and i think it attracts people who find
this recreational
and i don't mean that as hyperbole i
mean literally
all of the people there seem to be there
recreationally
i i'm not for that or against it i'm
simply noting it
[Music]
um
so if you assume that it was fun
and again i realized how disgusting that
word is in this context especially when
somebody got killed
but it did look like these people are
there for fun
what would stop it why wouldn't you have
as many
counter protesters tomorrow why wouldn't
you have
more trump supporters there tomorrow
than
last night well you'd say well one of
them got killed that's a reason not to
go
i don't think you understand if you
think that's going to keep people from
doing
doing this then you don't quite
understand
men that actually made it a little bit
more attractive
not to everybody everybody's different
you know but
but there are a lot of men who looked at
that and said yeah i think i'd like to
get a little bit more of that so who
knows where that's going
of course the guy who got killed is
already being branded as a white
supremacist
who knows what he is i'm not going to
say he is or is not any particular thing
i'm just going to say i don't know but i
don't think there's evidence of that
you know the story about rand paul
getting jostled by the protesters when
he left the rnc
but apparently alice johnson got
the same treatment alice johnson
african-american woman you know pardoned
by
the president and even she was attacked
by the
black lives matter protesters think
about that
and apparently she was quite scared
about that
there's there's another part of that
story that i need verification from
but there's there's a more alarming part
of the story not in terms of danger
but uh i'm gonna wait for a confirmation
before i mention that in public
all right um could president trump
and the trump campaign be any luckier
and again lucky is hard word to use in
this context because people are getting
killed
but luckier in the sense of if you were
running for election
and the biggest complaint against you
let's say two of the biggest
complaints against you are number one
you're some kind of an authoritarian
dictator
so that's a big worry about trump uh
number two that he may not be competent
just managing any kind of situation
so those those are two of you know
they're they're not the only complaints
about trump
but those are two of the biggest ones i
would think
and among those two big complaints
ted wheeler and also the
the governor whose name is
the governor whose name is
yeah you know whatever her name is
anyway mayor ted wheeler of portland
he uh wrote a letter didn't have to put
it in a letter
this is this is where the democrats are
just completely playing into trump's
hands
he didn't have to put it in a letter but
now he's formally and publicly
uh denounced trump's offer to send in
the national guard
and they say they got it under control
now
what could be more perfect for trump
because
every day that he doesn't overrule the
local mayor
think about it trump is the president of
the united states he's the
commander-in-chief
of the most awesome military force in
the entire universe
that's how much power trump has ted
wheeler
can't even walk outside in his own
street without getting accosted by his
own people or
protesters he's allowed in his town ted
wheeler's
own apartment is under attack by the
protesters
ted wheeler
stops the president from bringing in any
kind of force
with a letter
that's it a letter this little mayor
who has no power over his own citizens
or his own city
stopped this giant dictator
authoritarian with the most massive
military
on earth stopped and called
with a letter he wrote a letter and
that's it
and did trump say that's just a letter
i don't recognize your authority i'm
going to make some excuse to send in the
military anyway
nope trump just tweeted
i keep offering you keep saying no
anytime you want i can clear this up
it is so brilliant it's simple i mean
it's such a simple thing to do to simply
follow the rules and and not overrule
the local mayor bo
while offering to do it in a way that
other people think is fairly credible
because i think the public believes that
trump
actually could stop this in an hour i
mean that's a little bit of an
exaggeration but he could
he could stop it quite quickly with
enough
military presence especially if they're
only 150 people
how hard would it take any military unit
to stop 150 people if but i need some
kind of a fact check on that number
because if it's really that few people
it's very misleading
and it would be easier to stop than it
looks
all right um
[Music]
here's one of the reasons that you can't
know
who's doing a good job in the
coronavirus thing
you can't know because there are so many
variables involved
and it's you know it's apples and
oranges but here's one of the biggest
variables
that you wouldn't even think of
typically
if you're trying to decide okay which of
these national leaders did the best job
you wouldn't even think of this but you
should because if you leave it out
you haven't done the analysis right
notice that trump used
i'll call it the excuse or opportunity
of this virus to go hard at china
you get you know he has a built-in
reason to be mad at china because of the
virus
so that gives him some justified and
it's the justified part that matters
he can get really mad at china in public
and it's not sort of an insult to them
personally
because they kind of know that this is
real so
because the coronavirus really did come
from china
and nobody's doubting that that that's
you know now a settled fact
he can go hard at china but he can also
use the opportunity to claw back the
manufacturing which he's doing
so he's using the crisis if you will
the coronavirus he said okay here's an
opportunity that doesn't come along all
the time
i can now say publicly and aggressively
we're going to pull back
all the manufacturing american
manufacturing that we can
in whatever schedule we can from china
how big a deal is that well if you're
talking about the future of the united
states
it's a really big deal it's one of the
biggest things
that's ever happened let me say that
again
trump starting to bring back
manufacturing from china
isn't just a good idea it's one of the
biggest
things that will ever happen in this
country
it's that big it's gigantic it changes
the whole
nature of you know the world and the
balance of power
would he have done that and would have
been able to get away with it as
as effortlessly as it's happening had we
not had this
crisis and here's the key part
would another leader in the same
situation put into joe biden for example
and say he was president at this time
would joe biden have said
whoa here's a chance to pull back all of
our manufacturing
you know we'll do the easy ones first
like pharmaceuticals because that's just
obvious
the pharmaceutical part's just a
no-brainer there's nobody in the united
states
i don't think i don't think there's
anybody in the united states who's
saying yeah let's leave that over there
and china what could go wrong
so you do the easy one first so bi
didn't might have done that one
because that one's kind of a layup of
course you do that one
but would you have gone beyond that and
said now i'm going to start
paying other companies giving them
incentives to also come back
i think not so if you're looking at
trump's performance during the
coronavirus you cannot
take out of that the fact that he acted
in an
opportunity that i believe most
presidents
if not all of them you know democrat or
republican
most presidents i don't think would have
seen that opening
and i don't think that they would have
as aggressively pursued it and gotten
away with it
so far it looks like it's it's going to
be successful
it's early so how do you so when you're
saying okay the president messed up on
the coronavirus
what you mean is that people died who
didn't need to die
i think we'd agree that that's what you
mean
how do you count the number of people
who lived
because something that important for the
future of the economy
got fixed and nobody else would have
maybe
seen that opening or at least pursued it
you got to count that what does one
percent better gdp
mean for how many people live or die in
the future
it means a lot because there's a very
direct connection between your economic
well-being
and how many people die um you saw it in
the coronavirus
war suicides crimes up so the the worst
you know the worst people's situation is
the more
more death there is just it just always
follows that way
and that's just one of probably dozens
of things that you really can't sort out
and i and i always say this and it gets
really quiet when i say this
in order to say that trump did a bad job
you would have to say that if you took a
leader from some other country
just as a mental experiment said all
right let's take the leader of south
korea or new zealand and imagine that
they're the president of the united
states
at the time that trump was and and
they're the leaders
and let's say that they knew everything
about america the way trump does
but it's just that personality and that
talent stack from these other leaders
you put in that position what what ends
up different
because i'm not aware of anything that
trump did
that wasn't what the experts recommended
would one of those other
great leaders who has such good control
over things
would they have known in advance that
the test kits that the cdc made at first
were bad would the pres would the leader
of new zealand if they were our
president said
oh wait wait a minute i'm getting some
uh esp signals i can see that the test
kits that were made
that we had ready they're defective
they don't work how would any of them
how would trump
have known that how would eddie have
leader known that now you can say to
yourself
oh wait wait wait scott you know a good
leader
would have made sure that had been
tested we're ready would have made sure
we had
you know supplies which leader did that
were there any leaders that did that
i i don't think there are any leaders
who are smart enough to know
if their test kits were the right kind
that's not really a leader thing the
there
you you can imagine that nobody would
have gotten that right
um and as long as all of the leaders
would have followed the advice
of the experts and by the way as a
correction
trump often says that that he was the
only one who wanted to close
the travel from china and i think
fauci says that he was asked about it
and agreed
so fact check that on me but i think
even the closing of the travel
although it seemed to be trump's uh idea
it didn't come from the experts rather
it came from trump
but i think fouchy agreed i think he did
so fact check that on me i might be
wrong
but let's see um
there's a bill in the house
to decriminalize marijuana at the
federal
level and then put some kind of a tax on
it five percent tax on
legal sales and here's the thing
uh many of us have been surprised that
trump didn't do this himself or
advocate for decriminalizing marijuana
at the federal level
because he talks about it being a state
problem and if he talks about it that
way why would you leave free money on
the table
and it could be that
because trump has such an anti-drug
uh entire history it just could be
something you just you just can't go
there
which i would understand i don't hate
the fact
i do not hate the fact that we have a
president who doesn't drink
and i don't think that gets nearly
enough
attention imagine that
is this our only president who doesn't
drink
because people drink and they're still
president and
the odds of you you know at let's say 11
o'clock on some saturday night
the odds that you have a drunk president
are pretty good do you think hillary
would never have been drunk
um during you know on her time off but
presidents are not really ever
completely off duty right if something
comes up
so i think that's a way bigger deal than
people give him credit for
but he's so anti-drug anti-drinking that
maybe he just he just couldn't be the
guy who initiated it and i
i could understand that at a human level
at a human level and a role model level
you can
i doubt you'd do it for the role model
reason but
you can understand it but it leaves this
big opening for the democrats
to be the ones who initiated it so they
can get most of the credit
but i ask you this will it pass in the
senate there could be some you know
problems with the details of it that
makes it
unsignable but what if the senate passes
it and the house passes it
what is trump going to do
uh i think trump probably signs it
because i think 66 of the public is in
favor of it
i don't think it'll hurt him might help
him a little bit
people are going to ask why he didn't do
it before but again
he's the only president we've ever had
who was this clearly against
mind-altering substances
and i don't think we should lose that
that's just such a big deal
you know you always talk about the the
bad role model things he does with his
mean tweets
and the other something to that i'm not
going to say that there's nothing to
that
there's something to it but there's also
a lot
to the role model part of not being a
drinker
and not being a drug guy all right
um so let's hope that trump does sign
that if it happens
um here's a
we keep learning more about kyle
rittenhouse and
how close are we to the point where he
will be
unambiguously just treated as a hero
because that's not a safe place to be
because that would really inflame
tensions because
you know some portion of the public
thinks he's a white supremacist
as far as i know all the evidence
suggests he's not
the evidence that we have strongly
suggests he does not have any kind of
association
like that that he was actually just a
good citizen
pro police trying to help
it just seems like all the right
incentives and
actually even a good person who got in a
really bad situation
now you could argue that he should not
have tried to step up
and be useful in the way he did it you
know bringing a
a weapon to a place where it was
dangerous in the first place
so i'm not going to support the fact
that he showed up at all with a weapon
but i don't think that he had bad
intentions
and once more comes out about what he
did or didn't do
and it seems clear that it was either
obvious self-defense
or arguably self-defense which should be
good enough to not get him committed
uh convicted on any murder charges but i
worry that he's actually going to become
a hero
and it would be easy to happen
and that would be so divisive but i
think that's where we're heading
because it's just such a divisive time
all right
here is a question for you if the fake
news did not exist
with these protests and all the violence
that comes with it the looting etc would
any of that happen
without fake news i would say
with complete certainty that these
riots slash protest looting would not
happen
without fake news ginning people up
now by fake news i'll include social
media which is built on an
outrage model so now you have the
you know the formal news the television
news let's say
uh mostly television that is designed
to take a side and make you hate the
other team
that's their business model the business
model model of both fox news
and cnn msnbc especially
they're those three their business model
is tribal to make you love your team and
hate that other team on top of that is
social media which works on clicks
the more clicks the better and what
gives you more clicks than
violence and getting people
to have their hair set on fire so under
these conditions
of the fake news plus social media's
business model
this had to happen it wasn't even a case
of
these things are supportive of those
things happening no it's way
worse than that this or some version of
what you're seeing
had to happen once social media and the
news
had enough cumulative impact on people's
brains so our brains have literally
literally been
literally this is not hyperbole actually
physically rewired
i guess that's not technically literally
but your brain has changed
your actual structure of your brain the
chemistry or brain
has been programmed by these two kinds
of business models
the news and social media to be
different than it was and it was
programmed to be
more confrontational and as long as that
continued and it was cumulative and you
were more and more
confrontational it was very predictable
that the people who would
let's say the ones who would go first
the most gullible
and and i hate to say it but it is the
most gullible all right the people
believing the news
the people who believe that the
president called white supremacists
in charlottesville fine people if you
believe that
how would you act imagine you lived in a
country imagine
i'll take myself imagine if i believed
that the president had actually said
that would i be in favor of him being
removed by any means whatsoever
well i might not say it in public but if
we
actually had a white supremacist
president and i believe that that were
true
i might not say out loud that
some kind of uh non-election removal
was at least okay with me i i might say
in public
no gotta follow the constitution
but privately just as a human
i might be thinking you know i don't
care what it takes
you know if if somehow we accidentally
got a hitler
in charge i'm not that concerned about
the legal process
whatever it takes to get rid of a hitler
you know sometimes you got to do what
you got to do
right so i could easily see that if i
were as gullible
as i don't know i think the ratio
rasmussen found that
something like half of democrats
actually believed that to be true
if i believed it i i think i'd be fairly
sympathetic with the protesters you know
i wouldn't be sympathetic with the
damage and
the violence but i'd be sympathetic with
the with the movement
more than i am so yeah it's definitely
fake news and social media's business
model that's causing this
but i think you also have have to have
on top of that
a complete lack of competence in local
management
meaning the mayors and and the governors
of
some states not all of them because it's
not a coincidence that there are certain
places that these protests are
are thriving and there are other places
where let's say they wouldn't last as
long
you know what i mean there are more red
red cities if you will that this just
wouldn't happen
and if it did it wouldn't happen as long
so you need incompetence locally and you
need a lot of incompetence
you need probably foreign funding
if it if it turns out that someday in
the future
we have never learned that these
protests were funded
by non-americans i would be kind of
amazed
now i don't have evidence you know no
direct kind of evidence that there's
some
foreign influence china russia
soros you know pick pick your boogeyman
whoever you want
just pick whoever you want and oh yeah
somebody said 59
of democrats actually believe that the
fine people oaks
um but they also believe the green new
deal is a good deal
they believe that the president once uh
suggested
drinking bleach to cure coronavirus they
believed a lot of things
and if you're that gullible you don't
want to live in a world where all the
news is fake
uh that's a bad combination all right so
but i think the other coincidence that
had to happen was the coronavirus
i don't think that without the
coronavirus well
if the coronavirus was not part of the
picture i think the demonstrations would
happen but would be smaller and wouldn't
last
there's something about being able to
wear a mask
without being a masked person in other
words
i'm just wearing a mask because it's a
pandemic i'm protesting during a
pandemic of course i'd wear a mask
i believe that wearing a mask emboldens
you
and that although the the so-called
black bloc
part of antifa was wearing masks to
begin with
they were the ones doing all the bad
stuff but what happens if you say
all right now everybody wears a mask
because it's a pandemic
well suddenly anybody with a mask is
going to be bolder
because there's one less risk all these
cameras around
and you're saying to yourself well i
don't know if i would throw this brick
with all these cameras around
if i had my face you know visible
but if i've got a coronavirus mask on
and i've got a brick in my hand
maybe i throw it so i think you had to
have the corona virus you had to have
terrible
local uh leadership you had to have
complete
fake news you had to have um you know
gullible people but of course that's a
given
and you had to have the right weather
right you had to warm enough weather had
to be the summer
so it had to be an election year it's
basically
every possible thing that could line up
to create this situation
has lined up which is why trump will
win in win handily it looks like
all right uh
that is oh every once a while
because i'm a cartoonist and part of
what makes things funny
is oversimplifying them so you take a
situation that everybody understands and
they're mad about it but it's a
complicated situation
and you find the way to summarize that
big complicated thing in just a few
words
that is often funny because you
shouldn't be
taking a complicated situation and
dismissing it with just a few words
and if you do and if those few words
actually sound like you hit the heart of
the problem
even if it's wrong just you know your
bias says oh yeah that's what's
happening with that complicated
situation
uh you've got something funny and i read
on twitter i didn't write down who said
it
but that black lives matter is now just
teachers and felons
teachers and felons and i thought to
myself
first of all that's not anywhere close
to being true
you know if you took all the protesters
most of them are not
teachers most of them are not felons
they might become felons during the
protests but
that's you know they didn't show up that
way most of them
but as a simplification that just
captures that whole
vibe when you say that black lives
matter is nothing but teachers and
felons
and again the felons part is not a
racial thing because they're
i think there are more white people and
black lives better than there are black
people
so saying they're felons doesn't you
know that doesn't have a racial
component if you imagine there is
you're imagining it but uh teachers and
felons
and i thought yeah it feels right even
though i know it's
you know not close to true um
[Music]
all right those are the things that are
happening
it looks like there's not much else in
the way of news
uh brandon straka and his walk away
rally is an
sf golden gate on the golden gate bridge
this morning
somebody is saying
somebody says that they appreciate that
i do this
i don't know what this is exactly you
might be talking about a specific
opinion or you talk about the
periscopes in general yeah now how have
you been enjoying
how often i have been tweeting a hashtag
artist when somebody comes after me on
twitter
and they're completely irrational and
they demonstrate that they don't
understand
anything about the situation that
they're mad about
i always check their profile that's
usually a musician or a writer
or some kind of visual artist and i just
say hashtag
artist now you should adopt this method
if you're attacked online don't
argue with artists if they're artists
who
demonstrate that they don't have
critical thinking there are plenty of
artists
who are artists in addition to have
doing to doing things that gave them
some critical thinking
some people are just born able to do it
there are some people who are just born
able to do critical thinking it's just
somehow they have it
they could also be artists so there are
no 100 general
generalizations that work but
once you see that you're not the problem
is not
what they understand or their priorities
or anything
it's literally a lack of their talent
stack
their talent stack simply doesn't have
the skills
that would allow them to have the same
opinion as someone who has skills
and they don't know it so as long as the
people who don't have
talent and i'll say talent and decision
making
you know say economics business risk
management you know real world
mathematical risk taking understanding
if they don't have that they also don't
know they don't have it
which is the problem if they knew they
didn't have those skills
they probably wouldn't weigh in so
angrily imagining that they did
so that's actually what's happening
between the fake news
and the social media the people they're
riling up is what i'll call the artist
class because the rational people the
people who have bigger talent stacks
they've seen more
they have a better understanding of how
the world works are just not falling for
all the gullible stuff as much
all right um
looking at your comments
somebody says you're the only artist i
argue with
well you know i've never called myself
an artist so even though the thing i do
cartooning and writing certainly fall
into the category that i would
call art the way i do it doesn't really
fall into that category
the way i draw the the quality of my
artistic talents if you will is so
modest
that calling myself an artist it doesn't
even sound right to me
i've always called myself an
entrepreneur who tries lots of things
cartooning is one of the ones that
worked so other things have worked
you know i was also a highly paid
corporate
public speaker for a long time now
was that art well i don't know this is
giving a public speech and
art sort of a skill maybe i don't know
somewhere in there but um
i just look he has some comments going
by you
small restaurants going bankrupt half of
them
somebody's saying you know let me tell
you something about
small restaurants that you probably
didn't know
half of them are always going bankrupt
and 90
of them are going to go bankrupt if
they're not going bankrupt at the moment
there there's something going on that
nobody wants to say out loud
so i'll say it out loud a
large number of the businesses that
failed
or are failing or will fail because of
the corona virus
were going to fail anyway it did speed
it up
but um as other smart people have said
all of our trends got accelerated you it
looks like
if you look at it quickly you say oh
these things broke
well yes a whole bunch of things broke
and people went broke and bankrupt
that's true
but what really happened was a trend
that had to happen
just happened a little quicker such as
telecommuting
i don't think there was any chance that
telecommuting wasn't going to be a
bigger deal
because traffic got worse and rents and
living in the city was bad etc but it
got accelerated
and most of those restaurants would have
gone out of business
now here's why i have unfortunately
restaurant
experience if you have an independent
restaurant
and you've got let's say so much market
demand and you get your share
you're doing okay you're not getting
rich
if you've got a restaurant an
independent restaurant with a few
exceptions if you have a celebrity chef
i suppose
but they're not getting rich all right
they're just sort of getting by
as soon as a cheesecake factory shows up
within driving distance
you lose 10 of your customers because
the cheesecake factory just
absorbs from all the restaurants the day
it goes in
is bigger has more seats and it serves
so many types of food and it does a
really good job the food is excellent
i would say the service food ambiance
cheesecake factory does a really good
good job now if they don't go bankrupt
maybe they are i don't know but if they
don't
they were always going to be the walmart
or the amazon that put that small
restaurant out of business when i closed
my
uh two restaurants a number of years ago
it was right after the cheesecake
factory moved in
and also pf changs
if you want to hear the worst luck that
a restaurant owner ever had
this happened to me so i had two
restaurants at one point
i was a co-owner and one of the
restaurants
right across the street they opened a
mall
of restaurants it was a mall
of nothing but restaurants an entire
complex
of nothing but competitors to me across
the street
who had no competitors until then not
within walking distance
so i had a restaurant that was in a busy
area but you couldn't even
walk from that restaurant i don't think
yeah you couldn't even walk to another
restaurant it was that far away from
another one and directly across the
street
not just a good restaurant not just a
couple of competitors which of course i
would have expected
but a mall of restaurants
i didn't even know that was a thing have
you ever heard of a mall
of restaurants who has that happened to
him
anyway the point is that the small
restaurants were
doomed anyway it was a matter of time so
the long-term economic fallout
from this is going to be less than you
think not more
because the things that failed were
going to fail and they weren't making
much money anyway
so maybe some of those people got were
free to work on something more
productive
something that had more lasting ability
all right cheesecake factory next to
moles
is bankrupt yeah if you put a cheesecake
factory
in a mall and the mall itself died
you do have some big problems
all right you got lots of comments today
uh but i don't have much else to say
it's sort of a weirdly
slow news day has anybody seen joe biden
lately
no um
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you later
