is 15. good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization I don't know what else you
could have been doing on a Sunday
morning but it's clearly not as good as
this and this is getting good today
you're going to find out if you're an
NPC or the people in your family are or
possibly your friends or co-workers and
we've got a test for that and we'll see
how you do sound is looking good
technology good lighting good
no lighting's not good
oh yeah lighting's good lighting's good
everything's good what a day what a day
if you'd like to make it better all you
need is a cover of my girl glass of
tanker jealous and the canteen Jagger
flescope Festival of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens
now that's correct now go
monkeys are going to imitation and cats
and dogs are too I'm told in the
comments animals are good at imitation
well not only are animals good at
imitation but how do people become
successful in this world
I know it's a review quiz
how do people become successful
they imitate other successful people
that's right
unless you have a glass ceiling for
imitation
if you have a glass ceiling you can't
imitate to successful people
so don't ever give yourself a glass
ceiling
or you'll never be able to be successful
all right Ubi this Universal basic
income was tested I think it was in
Georgia
and the guardian writes that it was
successful
so a number of people mostly black women
were given extra money I think it was
850 a month and then they tested to see
how the experiment went and they
reported it was a big success
people took the Ubi payments and I know
nobody saw this coming they used it to
pay their bills
now not all the time
probably sometimes it went to lesser
good things but yeah people use money to
pay bills if they have money and if they
also have bills so you need both the
bills and the money
to get the money to pay the bills
because you have if you had money and no
bills well it's not going to happen
if you have bills and no money again
nothing's going to happen but they did
this Ubi test where they gave money to
people who had bills
and much like the experts imagined
some of the money went to pay the bills
so if they had not tested that you
it would be chaos I mean how would you
know anything
I would be thinking all right common
sense says if people have bills to keep
the phone on and eat
then they had money what is it what are
they going to do
what are they going to do with that
money I don't know so it's a good thing
they tested it big success
I've got a question for you
have we reached a point where only one
political party needs to be in favor of
uh supporting a war
is that what's happening right now is it
true that or are there still a bunch of
neocons that Republicans who are pro
Ukraine war
it because the thing I'm worried about
is this situation
if the media
has caused us to be so split as a
country
that if one side says yes the other
outside has to say no and it doesn't
even matter what the topic is uh
Democrats say yes what do you say
Republicans but what did the Democrats
say
they said yes well we say no we don't
want them to get political Advantage by
doing whatever it is they want to do
so as long as only one party can ever
agree on anything and the other party
has to be against it
um
isn't that pretty much guarantee that
you can't stop a war
because if a war starts and let's say
the president is the same party as at
least you know half of the Congress
isn't that enough to keep a war going
because you're never going to have a
situation where both parties say no to
war
because if one party says no the other
one has to say yes
that's just automatic now and the only
way you could stop a war
with let's say 60 percent of the public
being against it you know roughly
would be if both sides were against it
and that can never happen in our system
you can only have one side against it so
we've we've removed one of our obstacles
to war
what obstacle to war is you can't get
enough of the public opinion on your
side
but now you're going to get half on your
side no matter what you do you can do
anything
you could say we'd like to take all of
our money and dump it in the ocean
and the other side would say no but as
soon as they said no then everybody on
the other side would firm up and say you
know when I first started I didn't love
the idea but it started to sink in that
the Republicans hate it so I really like
it
so I would worry that the
um
so-called military-industrial complex is
the biggest benefactor of a divided
country
because there's not enough Unity to stop
a war
and politicians don't stop Wars that's
sort of not what they do
that's not that's not even on the job
description stopping a war
all right
all right uh
here's something that'll make your brain
spin
and this will be your first test for an
NPC I will be watching the comments
for the NPC comment that comes now the
NPC comment is the one that would be the
most obvious thing to say in any
situation
the most obvious thing so look for the
most obvious thing
and I I already have it in my mind would
you want me to write it down
to prove that I know what it is all
right I'm going to write it down
all right this is what the NPC will say
all right so it's out here I'm going to
see if I can get one one of the NPCs to
help themselves all right
so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna tell
you the story like it's not really a
test
just regular story
relax it's just a regular story there's
no test involved we're not testing to
see anything it's just a story so uh
here's here's my take on this
you know that
the AI that we have now is based on
these so-called large language models
and the large language models have
proven to us that there's something like
intelligence that can be graded from
nothing but words and the frequency that
they appear together
and apparently that's all it takes to
create something
that looks like intelligence but I would
argue that it only looks like NPC
intelligence
it's not the kind of intelligence where
people start with first principles they
reason things through with data you know
so it's not like an Elon Musk kind of
thinking
because he's clearly not an NPC
but rather they would use analogies
an analogy would be like hey that thing
sounds like this other thing so I'm
going to give you one of these
situations where the fact that so many
people will think in analogies is going
to create an enormous
let's say shift in thinking about
something all right that's too much
build up let me just give you the
example
um
climate change now looks exactly like
covet
let me explain climate change the the
topic looks exactly like covid from an
analogy perspective
not necessarily from a first principle's
reasoning perspective but from an
analogy perspective
all right we got my first first NPC
spotted I'll tell you in a minute it
didn't take long
all right so here's the analogy
specifically CO2
is covet
the virus
CO2 is the covet
and the uh the carbon removal
Technologies the carbon removal
Technologies
are the vaccinations
come on say it there we go first one
Scott has finally figured it out that's
what I was looking for
it's about time
it's about time
so if you said Scott you finally figured
it out it's about time
you're an NPC
I'm sorry
hahaha
but I could predict what you were going
to do it's about time
[Laughter]
sorry
so here's a
here's uh so I'm not
here's the point
what I'm telling you is that it's an
analogy
all right so that's all I told you I
said that your brain will imagine these
two things to be the same the NPCs said
it's about time you saw that these are
the same
no that's exactly not what I said
I said your brain will think these are
the same and then the NPCs said finally
you see that they're the same
no they're not the same
I'm telling you that the NPCs will see
them as the same unless I see it that
way
I would reason from what's happening to
you know what's the data showing us and
I would kind of Reason up and if I'd
reasoned up from the bottom and found
out they were the same well then I'd say
they're the same but I'm not saying
they're the same because they feel the
same
that it feels like an analogy you know
just because I could make an analogy
between CO2 and Covent doesn't mean the
same people are in charge
right they might be but it doesn't mean
that
all right so what it will mean is that
climate change will be much harder to
sell than it already was because
um because people will imagine it it's
just another pandemic thing which the
people on the right believe was fake all
along the people on the left believe
that the pandemic was exactly what the
news said it was a deadly virus and it's
a good thing you had those vaccinations
because it would have been much much
worse without them so that's half of the
country is looking at that analogy and
they're using the same analogy
to climate change oh my God you ignored
the science on covid and that's why so
many Republicans died that didn't have
to
now you're ignoring the science on
climate and you're going to make the
same mistake as you did during the
pandemic right so that story will be
running for the political left that the
pandemic is the same as the climate
topic
but their their analogy will be
completely different than the people on
the right who will also say they're the
same
but their version is that where they
were both fake
now I was having an online conversation
about
whether we're a simulation and one of
the points was
uh that we couldn't be a simulation
because it would be too many details
that the simulation would have to keep
track of to keep it consistent and I
said
there's nothing consistent in our in our
observation
you and I are seeing completely
different realities and always have
so there is no consistency requirement
if we're a simulation it can be
completely inconsistent and that would
look just the way it looks today
because we don't even agree what the
news was you don't even agree with your
siblings what happened when you were 12
that day
right we walk around with completely
different realities in our heads so no
the simulation requires no programming
to make us all think we're living in the
same reality we already do
we just don't notice it's all different
my favorite example of that is tennis
now I think I think this is
scientifically valid or at least I heard
it was
um if you see a tennis ball hit at a
hundred miles an hour and it hits the
ground and bounces up and you're a
professional tennis player you say I I
just watched that ball hit the ground
and they missed the line
so I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge it and
then the they play the replay and you
see it actually sat right on the line
before it bounced
does that mean that the person who saw
it is lying because they said I saw it
online
or were they hallucinating
well the answer is they were
hallucinating because your eyes are not
even capable of seeing a ball that's
moving 100 miles an hour you see a blur
and what you might see is the ball just
before a hit
and then your eye might pick it up again
after it's bounced up
but the part where it hit the ground and
you remember it clearly hitting the
ground
is not a memory
it's manufactured
your brain fills in the stuff in between
because your eyes can't really track it
going that fast
so you have a you have a very specific
memory that ball hitting the line
exactly where you saw it and then
jumping up but in fact you didn't see it
because you couldn't your eyes are not
capable of tracking a ball
the entire path
Now by luck by luck you might have maybe
picked it up when you hit the ground but
mostly you're seeing it every few feet
and then your brain is filling in what's
between
once you learn that everything makes
sense
all right
um
here's another way
to identify an NPC we're going to do
another test in case you need
confirmation
if you think you're an NPC based on the
first test you can make sure you comment
on this one so don't go quiet
just comment but do what you were going
to do anyway say what you were naturally
going to say okay
so the Biden Administration is funding
they've got a lot of money billions to
put into 3.5 billion fund for developing
um
machines that suck carbon out of the air
it's giant machines that suck carbon out
of the air
go
so say it say it
we're going to be sucking the carbon out
of the air with giant machines
say it
there we go the first one
first one
you mean trees
yeah trees you did it all right so
everybody who mentioned trees as being
the carbon capture that we need we don't
need this carbon capture we only need
trees
what kind of thinking is that
um something that captures CO2 is sort
of a machine
but what would you like that like like a
tree by analogy
a tree would be like this so they're the
same because there's an analogy
they're the same thing
that's an NPC
all right here's what here's what a
non-npc would say
is it the existence of CO2 that's a
problem
no
is it the amount of CO2 in the air right
now that's a problem
no
is it the rate of change in the beliefs
that if we reach a certain threshold
then things will go bad
yes
so under that scenario are the trees
that we have and the trees that we could
plant in the future would that be
sufficient
probably sufficient to keep it where it
is Ish but not enough to take care of
what we imagine will happen what about
if we build these machines well the
first ones will be bad and inefficient
because they always are everything the
original version of everything but if we
make it a market we make it profitable
we would expect that the free market
would boost their performance and though
someday although we're not sure we have
hope that we can invent our way to a
point where we can remove enough from
the air
that that would be better than trees
now that's what you would say if you
were not an NPC now you would still
argue whether it would work you would
argue whether you could get there you
would argue whether the numbers are
right but that would be the thinking
process if you said to yourself
machine takes CO2 out of air trees take
CO2 out of air don't need machines
if that's what you just did you're an
NPC
now let's see the third test
third test let's see if we can find
another one
um it's a good idea to take the CO2 out
of the air
because it would be hard to stop people
using fossil fuels go
there we go
we got the first one let's see if we can
get another one
another NPC
um keep going keep going I know there's
one here I know there's an NPC here
there we go John
y NPC
because we need the CO2 to survive
all right that's
now let me do it again
CO2 is necessary for the Earth
it's necessary
there's a machine
that's going to remove CO2 from the
Earth
uh oh the Earth is doomed
because we need CO2
but if we have machines that take it
away
but we need it we need it it's required
so if you take it away I guess we'd all
die
laughs
that's not really thinking
does everybody see that
that there's no thought involved in that
that's some kind of you know comparison
analogy weird thing but if you started
from
you know sort of reasoning in a
scientific way you'd say how much CO2 do
we need oh somewhere between this range
probably
somewhere in this range how much are we
going to get well if we're right the
scientists are right it could be more
than that range so let's hook up some
machines to bring it maybe if we can to
slow it down slow the growth or maybe to
bring it back down in range
at what point do you think we would suck
so much CO2 out of the air that would
the the planet would die and we wouldn't
notice it before it happened
you don't think that we would turn it
off
I think we got enough now
or or even better yet we would use more
fossil fuel maybe because we had plenty
of cushion
we're not we're not going to destroy the
plants because we suck too much and uh
CO2 I mean do you really think that
could happen
do you think it there's actually a
chance we would just keep sucking CO2
out of the air until the plants died and
we wouldn't
we would never adjust
I feel like we would
I feel like we'd adjust
all right
so if you hear somebody say CO2 is plant
food Scott don't you know that they use
it in greenhouses
yes I do
yes I do NPC I do know that CO2 is used
in greenhouses I also know that that's
an analogy
use it in a greenhouse
that's good
so must be good
now that's not thinking
all right by the way I don't know if we
have too much CO2
okay let me say that I don't know if we
have too much CO2
beats me
I'm not saying we have too much or we'll
have too much
don't know for sure
but the way I would think about it would
be that way all right so I uh study a
valuable study that suggests that trolls
online trolls have low self-esteem and
may be doing it to get attention
wow that's valuable
I wonder if they talk to the people who
did the Ubi test
because you know we were kind of shocked
to find out that if you give people
money they'll pay their bills with it
but now I'm even more shocked to find
out that trolls
it's almost like the trolls are not
emotionally stable
did anybody see that coming
surprise
yeah
but I think my new thing will be to say
to the trolls
um did that help your self-esteem
when I get trolled did that help your
self-esteem oh
I hope it helped ah little guy
all right
um here's the zombie story that never
dies see if you've ever heard this
before
there's a claim of the of some
impropriety in the 2020 election
has anybody heard that before
the specific claim of some impropriety
in the election you might seem to think
you've heard of this story before but I
guess uh there's a attorney general in
Michigan who's a Democrat which is
important to the story who is referring
some 2020 information about election
potentially fraud to the FBI now the
claim
which I expect to be debunked like every
other claim is that eight to ten
thousand ballots were delivered by one
person
so one of two things is going to happen
the claim will be debunked
or will determine that it wasn't enough
to change the result
right so we're going to pretend that it
only happened once in one place because
that's the one they caught
but they'll say it wasn't enough to
change the result
or they'll say it's too late
yeah that was bad but it's too late
but nothing's going to happen from it
right
we assume nothing will happen so even if
they found this uh this charge to be
true that some person left eight to ten
thousand ballots all by themselves in a
Dropbox or dropped them off somewhere
I don't feel like this is going to hold
up
and the only reason I say that
is because nothing has so far it's sort
of the 20 to 1 odds against it but maybe
maybe I'm still betting that Trump will
uh
pull the rabbit out of the hat for his
third act and that magically Against All
Odds we will actually find that there
was election fraud now the only reason I
say it is not based on any evidence I
have no evidence whatsoever just to be
really clear I'm using the fiction model
of predicting which says that reality
matches movies where there's a third act
that seems impossible you know the hero
can never get out of this this box he's
going to die there's no doubt about it
and then magically finds a way out
that's what makes it a movie
if Trump got reelected or didn't get
reelected and nothing ever changed about
our opinion about the 2020 election that
would not be much of a movie
but if he comes back
and in the context of coming back we
find out that there was in fact fraud in
2020 that made a difference and maybe
maybe there's some you know official
endorsement of it from a court for
example
that would change everything and that
would be a proper movie
so for no other reason no other reason
then it would make a proper movie and
for reasons I don't understand life
follows movie patterns
I predict it
before the before the vote is cast in
2024 could be the last minute but before
the vote is cast that would be actually
that would be the best
the best would be
a day before the actual vote
Trump's still behind in the polls
against whoever he's running against I
used 10 points behind and then suddenly
the Supreme Court or somebody rules at
the 2020 election was in fact a problem
and and what with one day left 40
percent of the public flips and it's the
biggest Landslide of all time now that
would be a movie
that would be a movie I'm not predicting
40 of the public will switch to Trump
but it would be a great movie if it
happened
this is kind of funny
um
there's a congressman that Greg stube
who's filed articles of impeachment
against uh Biden
for his alleged crimes and trying to
Shield uh Hunter Biden from prosecution
or whatever
he says it's long past due
now I don't know enough about the
details of impeachment to know is this
enough to make it happen
one Congressman filing articles that's
that's not enough to make it happen
right
isn't there more procedural stuff that
probably will knock it down
feels like theater right
I'm just assuming it won't happen
all right well it's in the news but
wouldn't get too excited about it
um
I sought to wait do you have this
experience when you see a tweet from
somebody who's in a different news
bubble
which doesn't mean your bubble is the
one that's right but when you see the
other bubble you say really
really there's somebody in that bubble
that's like a weird little bubble here's
one of the bubbles
somebody on x
which you call Twitter David Weissman
tweeted why are Republicans refusing to
show actual evidence of a Biden crime
the only thing they've showed us is
speculation why is there a phony
investigation allowed to continue
doesn't that sound funny to you if
you're in the other news bubble that
there's no evidence of Biden's
wrongdoing
now he did say specifically bribe
I don't have any evidence of a bribe do
you is they basing evidence of a bribe
not really because a bribe would require
money transfer
for a specific favor am I right
it would be a specific favorite there's
no evidence of that
there's certainly claims well let me let
me modify that there's certainly a claim
that Joe and the prosecutor the Brit
that was going and looking into prismo
that that was a quid pro quo
but we don't have we don't have a
specific payment
that's attached to that specific request
we don't
we just know that it would be good for
Prisma we know that they put Hunter on
the board for that exact purpose for
that exact purpose we do know that they
tried to get him to leverage his power
to get rid of the prosecutor that seems
to be in writing
but that doesn't quite get you there
does it it doesn't get you all the way
to bribe
it gets you to influence
you know I don't know how illegal it is
to have General monetary influence on
somebody it's not ideal certainly should
be disclosed where it exists like a far
Earth type of thing
but I don't know
I honestly don't know that I've seen a
crime
I've seen lots of things that look close
to a crime I've seen things that I think
should be a crime
but I don't know if I've seen one so I
would agree that you know we're just
short
of put the handcuffs on them but you
can't get any closer you could not get
any closer to everything about this is
wrong
without it being technically violating
something
but it might you know when when things
are complicated at this level
there's always some kind of technical
violation there
but uh but I think it's funny that
there's somebody who imagines that
there's no wrong doing because of the
incompletement incompleteness of the
evidence
so there must be people who don't know
that the money flows are are well
established at this point
and that the money flows come from
places that they should not be coming
from
for where they ended up right so it's
obvious that no
no tangible Public Services were given
other than influence
but suppose the influence is mostly
just opinions
and
things that might have happened anyway
it's hard it's hard to it's hard to
evaluate influence when there's an
argument on both sides for doing
anything
right if I bribed any politician to do
anything
they could just take the other argument
and say you know what there were two
arguments here and I've decided that the
other one's a little stronger but
there's always an argument on the other
side so how are you going to know that
the bribe is why somebody changed unless
the paperwork who says I'm bribing you
to do this
so
I'm just amazed that the Democrat news
or the news the Democrats watch doesn't
convince them that no matter what this
was legal or illegal
is still impeachable
would you agree
it's the most impeachable thing I've
ever seen in my life you can't possibly
have a president who's got these
connections and and at least the risk
the risk of blackmail you don't know
there is any I haven't seen evidence
there is any
but the risk of blackmail is through the
roof
so that's that's not acceptable
all right uh meanwhile in Iowa the
Republicans are there competing in the
world's most boring State sorry Iowa
most boring state in the world and
somehow DeSantis found a way
to be more boring than the state itself
did you see the videos of him serving
eggs on the stick
he looked like he didn't want to be
there he was completely uninterested in
the public
and he just he just wasn't interested
and then there's one of him at a plate
at a
with his kids playing on a playground
there was otherwise empty and the entire
press is there and all they're doing is
watching him with a nicely tucked in
pressed button-up shirt in the park
because that's what you wear to go to
the park
well pressed button-up shirt some khakis
and he's just pushing his kid on the
swing
and I'm thinking this is so weak
now let's compare that to another person
who's in Iowa
has anybody heard how many of you heard
that Vivek wrapped an Eminem song in
Iowa just tell me if you've heard the
story did you hear the story you don't
have to hear the rap but did you hear
the story that he wrapped
yes yes you did
doesn't matter that you heard him rap
no not really no it once again
just just try to hold in your mind the
level of skill that was employed here
DeSantis went to Iowa and served eggs on
the stick
and then pushed his child on a
playground so that's that's what his
advisors he got for him so he listened
probably listened to his advisors and
did two things that are lame or
irrelevant
Vivek almost certainly did not take
advice from an advisor when he wrapped
Eminem
can we agree on that
nobody's advisor ever told them to wrap
Eminem at Iowa State event nobody there
there will never be an advisor who tells
you to rap at an Iowa Event
but if you're Vivek
you know it will work
because you know it will break the
headlines there's nothing else happening
you know that it's uh it's just so video
friendly I mean it's just irresistible
if you hear that a presidential
candidate tried to rap
especially Eminem Who is
anti-republican or at least anti-trump
sort of it's got everything it's like
everything but it's also harmless
and it shows energy
shows he's not embarrassed by anything
it also shows he has some skills Beyond
you know politics and business
how many days in a row do I have to tell
you
he's killing it yeah it's it's Bill
Clinton's saxophone
play that's exactly right now I don't
know if Bill Clinton had an advisor that
said yeah go play the saxophone on The
Late Night show
because that's not crazy it's not crazy
to play the saxophone
but if you're a Republican
rapping Eminem in Iowa
that's a whole new deal
and it's just sort of sort of brilliant
and play yeah it's playful that's
exactly what it is now remember
politics is not about making you think
it's about making you feel
did you feel anything
when DeSantis handed out his eggs on a
stick
I'll tell you what I felt I felt sorry
for him honestly literally politics
aside I just felt kind of sorry for him
because it looks to me like a campaign
that's given up
it doesn't even look like professional
level work at this point it looks like
they've given up I think he's decided
that you know he got some attention and
after a few months of
hating being on the do you think that
DeSantis is enjoying running for
president
do you think his uh wife and children
are delighted
but not
gonna say not he doesn't look like he's
enjoying it and now he probably thinks
he has no chance of winning unless Trump
gets taken off the field and then I
think Vivek Vivek is going to take those
votes if Trump gets taken off the field
I don't think DeSantis is in first place
I think he's in second
maybe third
well let me ask the question
if Trump disappeared or dropped down
tomorrow
do you think DeSantis will go to first
second or third place immediately
you might go to third
because
you know maybe somebody like Tim Scott
would will pick up some Trump votes
yeah maybe second maybe third but I
think for vague laps him if that happens
because Vivek is the obvious to me he's
the obvious choice if there's if the
number one guy gets taken out
all right now there's a story that might
remind you of a play the Democrats do
what is it that Democrats like to do
that Tucker Carlson often reminds us
that's right blame the Republicans of
whatever they're doing
so which doesn't mean the Republicans
aren't doing it
because they might be doing it as well
but the standard trick is to you know
blame the Republicans for whatever
Democrats are doing now I don't know if
that's what's happening in this case
but if you use that filter it looks kind
of sketchy because the Democrats are now
blaming
um former Trump officials for getting
access to voting machines in Georgia
after the election
but apparently they were offered and
somehow accepted allegedly allegedly
access to voting machines now I I need
some fact checking on this because I
believe this story is intentionally
confusing
I think we're supposed to be left with
the impression because the story seems
to be told intentionally vaguely I think
they're trying to leave us with the
impression that Trump hacked the
election
because Trump people got into voting
machines
I think they're trying to make us forget
that the context was after the election
and the point of it was to find out if
there was any bad behavior that happened
that could be a detected
am I wrong about that give me a fact
Jack am I am I describing this story
correctly because when I read the story
I kept thinking why is it written so
confusingly why is it taking me so long
to figure out what they're saying and it
was as if they were trying to create a
narrative without saying it because it
would be a lie if they said it directly
it was if they're trying to suggest
the Republicans hacked voting machines
ahead of the election by making the
timing of it the least important part of
the story
that's what it feels like now I'm not
going to say that's necessarily
intentional
it could be just if you have bias that's
the way you write a story but it's
really sketchy the the this is looking a
little too much on the nose like
Republicans finding a thing that they
can blame the other side for doing
to cover up the fact that they're doing
it now I'm just saying it looks like
that that would be sort of an NPC take
because there's no evidence of it it
just sort of has that feel to it
we'll watch that story and see if
anything I imagine that's going to turn
into a lot of nothing
let's talk about the Hawaii fires
uh official death counts up to 93 and I
heard that two of them have been
identified
now
do you have a sense of the devastation
93 dead and two identified
and as somebody said we're talking about
a fire that melted Steel
you could barely tell that it's a body
much less identified
now I'm going to tell you something that
I've heard that is unconfirmed
but it's from a resident
there's something being covered up this
this is I don't know this for sure but
this is a report from a resident
somebody who's close to it actually in
the scene
the residents some of them believe
that the extent of the death is Way
Beyond what you're hearing
and that it's so bad
and that the officials were so
incompetent
that if they ever told you how bad it is
right now
there would be death
that they would just be killed
so that's the rumor the rumor is that
the real death count is Way Beyond what
you're hearing the officials know it but
if the officials tell you and there's
something else about the story I'm not
telling you but I'm doing that
intentionally because it's too horrible
there's something about this
that some of the residents believe
is too horrible to be told
I don't know if it's true it has nothing
to do with the directed energy weapon
right has nothing to do with the cause
I'm not talking about the cause I'm
talking about the outcome right so we'll
talk about the cause next put the cause
separate
yeah everybody's suspicious about the
cause I'm talking about the outcome
some of the some of the people believe
that they're being lied to about the
true nature of how bad it is because if
they told the truth the officials would
be killed
that's how bad it is that allegedly that
they would actually just be killed
now imagine how how bad would that have
to be
that's the rumor it is actually that bad
now I don't know that that's true
so put a put a big question mark by this
right everything coming out of there is
going to be sketchy
but there's there and it might also be
if you want to further the conspiracy
theory here if you want to further it
that could be the reason there's no
communication coming out of there
in other words it might be possible that
they could have put the cell phones back
online
and they may be choosing not to
because if you actually heard what was
happening
people would be killed
that's what I'm hearing now I hope to
God none of that's true I hope to God
none of that's true
but you know there's going to be a lot
of rumors
so let's talk about some of the other
rumors if you believe there's a chance
that a directed energy weapon
from space started the fires
how do you rule out
that it would be easier to just throw
matches
you know you don't really need a
space-based weapon
to start a fire
is literally the easiest thing you could
do
start a fire
what would stop you from starting a fire
anywhere
and if you have a directed energy weapon
would you reveal its existence
potentially by using it for something
you could do with matches
if you could do it with matches you
don't reveal the existence of your
directed energy weapon in space
so I would say the odds that it was a
directed energy weapon from space and by
the way there's some hilariously
obviously fake pictures of it you know
as if somebody had their camera and they
got a good picture of the the moment
that the laser hit the Earth or
something now I don't think it was a
directed energy weapon that would be the
least likely possibility
least likely
how about uh
so how many of you have ever been to
Maui
I want to get a fact check in this have
you ever been to Maui a number of you
have right
for those of you have been and I've been
there maybe 10 times I don't know
um have you ever noticed there are
almost no police
does anybody notice that
you can be on Maui for a week and never
see a police car or a policeman or a
security guard
no please
um I know they have I know they have
fire facilities
but you know it's not like you see it
much so here's my question
weren't they the least prepared in terms
of Emergency Services I I think they had
less
or fewer people who do that kind of work
there at the time I I think that part of
the story might be that Maui is
generally so safe it's a really low
crime place
that they just don't have many First
Responders
it's just low on First Responders it's
the worst place to have a have a problem
like this now separately there's a
problem that the they should have
sounded through tsunami alarms
you've heard that one so they have a
number of you know alarms that they
didn't sound and when the communications
were cut people didn't know to evacuate
because there was no alarm and there's
no phone and there was no internet
so people kind of stayed too long and
that's probably what got him so imagine
if you were the authorities
and that's true now we don't know it's
true
but imagine it is
imagine you knew that you would have all
lived your family would have survived if
they had just pushed the button on the
tsunami alarm because everybody would
know at that point oh let's let's
get out of here and run away
now I don't know if they would have
known what to do if it's a tsunami alarm
but they would have known the shit's
going down right so I I believe I've
been on the island when they've done the
alarm has anybody see has anybody been
on the island when they heard the the
test
I think I was there during a test once I
may be
that might be a false memory but I
thought I was there during a test
and
so I'm pretty sure it works but maybe
maybe it was the first thing that got
burned I don't know so we probably have
to find out why they didn't do it
but imagine imagine if that was the
problem
that it was just incompetently handled
and people lost their families
I don't think you understand how violent
that would get
yeah I think the native Hawaiians
especially are going to say that's too
far right either give us warning
too far all right
so there's not much you can say except
the
um you know there are a lot of people in
the mainland as they like to say in
Hawaii a lot of people in the mainland
who are insanely sad about this because
too many of us is like a second home
all right
um CNN Jake Tapper is saying that the
Republicans might have a point
what
can you imagine anything on CNN that
sounds like that he actually said that
they might have a point now you might
want to know what story is he talking
about
well he's saying that maybe the
whistleblowers are right
and that when when the prosecutor Weiss
said that um
first said he was allowed to charge
people in any state and then he went
back and said no I can't charge people
in any state so then he had to become a
special counsel and so Jake Tapper is
saying wait a minute why did he have to
be given the powers
that Garland said he already had
so he's saying that the Republicans have
a good point that this story doesn't
match
he either had the power or he didn't and
if he had the power why did you have to
give him power that he already had so
even even Jake Tapper
can't find a way to spend that
to make that sound like it was a good
idea
so
I feel like Biden is not anybody's First
Choice as CNN what do you think
I feel like they know if you know if
they could nudge him out
they'd have a better chance of getting a
Democrat elected maybe I mean I don't
know who would replace him
but I thought that was notable
um
my so I've got a book coming out about
reframes I talk about reframes a lot and
when you start seeing the world in terms
of reframes which is just rearranging
the words and thoughts about something
to make it more useful I would say the
most damaging reframe in America
is that doing the things that successful
people do is acting White
the number one most damaging reframe in
America can you think one more damaging
because I feel like you know everything
from retail stores pulling out of cities
I mean they're just so many of our
problems right now are directly related
to the reframe that doing the all of the
things that successful people do is
unacceptable to
some
portion of our public
at the shows
so I think that's I I would rank that as
the most damaging reframe taking a
normal situation and just conceiving of
it differently
that's the number one most damaging one
in the country
so that's the one I'm going to try to
fix
you know that I've been working on this
for a while it got me canceled so so
words of the wise if you're looking to
reframe something
don't start like I did
that shouldn't be your first move maybe
you want to ease into it don't make
everybody's hair on fire the first thing
you say save that for later once once
you've got a little base of argument
going so I guess I alerted that the hard
way there's a mass looting reported in
uh in a mall in LA
uh Nordstrom's got taken down by 30
robbers
Mike cernovich and others have pointed
out that these are organized gangs you
know law enforcement told us it's
organized so it's not just a bunch of
friends who decided to get together it's
organized if it's organized it almost
certainly crosses state borders
and that would make it uh and it would
make it Rico if it's organized and state
orders would make it FBI
and the thinking is that these could
easily be stopped
with the application of enough law
enforcement
and that therefore seeing no effort to
stop it
suggests that the people in charge
whoever they might be want
um this kind of crime to happen when I
say this kind of crime I'm talking about
a kind of crime that doesn't destroy the
country but it makes it so difficult to
go through daily life that you will beg
for an authoritarian to win to impose
order
and that the idea is that this crime
waiver you're seeing is intentionally
allowed to run
so that authoritarian
authoritarian rule could be imposed now
if you want to go the extra level
digital IDs and digital money
would be the end result of this
something like well the police are
helpless to stop crime the police can't
stop crime I don't see any way police
can stop crime so we'll get rid of the
police oh crime got worse what are you
going to do well you know it would be
good
if he knew where everybody was and you
knew what they were up to
and you could turn off their money
if they did bad things
so we'll make sure we've got a picture
of everybody and we'll try to figure out
who they are when they go in the store
if they don't have masks I guess and uh
we'll uh use our authoritarian control
to make sure that your stores are not
robbed so citizens don't worry
we can stop this crime wave by removing
all of your freedoms
and if you're if your privacy is given
up totally
um then you can stop this crime wave
just vote for us
how many of you think that that's the
plan
and and that that's an intentional part
of the plan is letting crime run so that
we'll be softened up for a totalitarian
move or moves
um I don't believe it because it would
require too much human intelligence and
control
and there's no evidence that humans have
that kind of intelligence or ability to
coordinate across so many different
domains
to me it looks like an emergent property
so it might it might be that that's
where it's headed if you ask me where
it's heading
I would say oh it's definitely heading
that way I think I've been telling you
for 10 years
that privacy will go away
and that's not a preference
there's just there's no other way as
soon as one person can destroy a whole
city with AI or
you know with a with a microbe of some
kind
then everybody's going to have to be
watched all the time or we'll all be
dead
or at least that'll be the argument so
there's no doubt that privacy will
someday go away there's also no doubt
that money will someday be digital
20 years 30 years six months I don't
know when
but you cannot imagine 30 years from now
paying for things with a piece of paper
or a plastic card
although I would say a plastic card is
digital money but
you know that's just me
it goes through a bank so I guess that's
different but
yeah anyway so I would say everything is
heading exactly where you think is
heading but I don't believe in the
puppet master I don't believe Klaus
Schwab is in charge I don't believe
Soros is in charge and I definitely
don't believe that if Soros and Klaus
Klaus Schwab got in a room they would
agree on what needs to be done
who do you think's in charge Soros or
Klaus Schwab or do you think they're
working together so that's the problem
in the real world billionaires don't
work together
in the real world they're all just doing
their own thing
uh you don't hear too many billionaires
colluding I think it's more like well
I'm sure they are onesies and Tuesdays
I'm sure they do but
people are looking out for themselves
what I see is a whole bunch of people
doing what's good for them
and the end result will be a loss of
privacy and digital money
facial recognition everywhere
the free market gets you in the same
place
and
um
and I think the other thing that gets
you to the same place
is uh
most Democrats being women
let me ask you this
tell me anything that's happening that
you attribute to the great reset
or to anything else that could not also
be 100 Sun explained by democrats are
dominated by women and single women in
particular
that would explain all of your
observations
right
because how many republican men wanted
to cut funding for police
how many republican men are looking at
all the Looting and saying well that's
better than the Alternatives of putting
them in jail
better than the alternative how many men
are saying that
none
right
why are why are these uh 30
I'm okay let me ask you another question
30 people robbed the store why are they
still alive
why are the 30 robbers still alive
it's not because of man
do you think men said you know
I think I think this is fine
if all the women tomorrow went on
vacation and turned off their phones
shoplifting would end in two days
you just need the women to turn off
their phones and
stop interacting the men will take care
of it
do you think there's any man anywhere
who doesn't know how to stop crime in
stores
anywhere there's no one man who doesn't
know how to stop retail theft 100 of us
know
you know why we can't women it's women
women won't let us go violent
not as violent as we need to be
at the moment what's needed is
tremendous violence
without it you'll get more of this
now I don't recommend violence
don't recommend it you should try
everything first and you should
certainly if you do the violence you
don't want to do it with police and you
know sanctioned well-trained legal
violence but it wouldn't require
violence
and women women are the ones stopping us
from doing it basically
now
I'd like to talk to the NPCs
NPCs when I say a global statement like
women or Republicans Or democrats I
never mean every one of them
I never mean every one of them
not once I do believe that there are
plenty of Republican women who would uh
strap one on and and and the shoplifting
tomorrow
plenty of Republican women have guns
and know how to use them in the right
context plenty I'm just making a big
generalization
big generalization is that if women
weren't
you know maybe more than half of the
political power in the country
there would be no retail theft
it's it's sort of a man's problem that
men are not allowed to solve
we can solve it
yeah yeah and and I know a lot of you
are thinking it's like oh it's a racial
thing
you're thinking you know the problem is
every time you see a video it's black
people robbing stores am I right pretty
much every time this video of black
people robbing stores so that makes
everybody feel helpless because it would
look racial if you did anything about it
but I would argue that you could end
retail theft tomorrow
by just telling other black American
citizens that they could do anything
they want to end it
hey black Americans if you want stores
in your town
we'll we'll just walk away for an hour
and you do whatever you need to stop it
I think black Americans would stop
retail theft in in one minute
because they would just take care of the
people doing it
so to speak
so it's another if you think the the
racial component is like the main
variable here
is sort of main visual variable but I
don't think men are on different sides
do you think black men
want their stores to disappear
I don't think so I don't think so at all
and I think if you gave them some legal
mechanism to stop it they would do it
right away
that's what I think
so
anyway cities are dead
Paul Graham was tweeting the researchers
at the University of Toronto used cell
phone usage to measure how dead the
cities are so measuring from the coven
rebound apparently no big city is more
than two-thirds
the cell phone usage of what it was
pre-covet
no big city
is even above two-thirds of what it was
in cell phone usage
before the pandemic
none
San Francisco is the worst at only
one-third
of the 2019 cell phone usage
one-third
wow yes cities are dead
anybody who goes visits the city or even
drives through one
if you have any choice to not just don't
do it all right well once crime became
legal in cities you had to get out now
one thing that could save us and I think
you'd agree is if the media decided that
this crime needed to end
now our opinions come from the media
so especially if the left left leaving
media said it's too far you know we got
to get police in there now to their
credit I would say that
probably most people in the media on the
left do you think
the defund the police went too far
would you agree at least the serious
people you know the people in the news
business they're pretty sure that the
defund the police went too far but they
can't really say that too hard because
their audience you know doesn't want to
hear it
but
let me just point out one imperfection
with our system
in a perfect world your media is the the
watchdogs of the bad behavior right so
they're what they're the ones making
sure your government doesn't do bad
stuff too much the the media make sure
the corporations aren't abusing the
citizens too much right
so one of the biggest uh to watch well
one of the biggest Watchdogs would be
the Washington Post would you agree
The Washington Post is not like other
newspapers uh by you know not only by
where it exists in Washington DC but
also because it's a major media driver
of news The Washington Post is what's
called a news maker
meaning that if they say something's
important the other media follow
for example when I got canceled it was
primarily because the Washington Post
went first
so they're the ones the other newspapers
look at and then they say all right well
if you think that's the thing everybody
cares about it now so we'll report on it
the same way or also
so the Washington Post doesn't have just
the power of a big entity it has the
power of a big media entity that
influences all the other media entities
the New York Post New York Times will be
another right so when you talk about
news making newspapers it's you know
it's the Wall Street Journal it's a
Washington Post it's the New York Times
so my only Point leading up to my bigger
point is that they are they create news
by telling other people what to
concentrate on
the owner of Amazon owns the Washington
Post
what do you think the Washington Post is
saying about all the retail stores the
biggest competition to Amazon what do
you think they're saying about their
boss's competition being destroyed
for reasons that aren't clear
you know we defunded the police that's
clear but why we keep doing it is
unclear
yeah
now so I tweeted to Phil bump who's an
opinion guy at the Washington Post and I
wanted to see
if they've even noticed
that the destruction of retail goes
directly to the benefit of their boss
because we'll just buy online
how is that not important
or do you think that the Washington Post
should recuse itself from any stories
about uh retail theft
you know what I'd like to see
The Washington Post is going to recuse
itself from stories about these online
theft because of it would be a conflict
of interest
it would be a gigantic conflict of
interest in fact the Washington Post
should never report
about anybody calling for defunding the
police because defunding the police is
the same as give money to amazon.com
how many of you would want to go to a
retail store in a urban center today
I wouldn't
you would you would never catch me in a
Walgreens in San Francisco if they have
any left maybe they're all gone you
think I would go to a Walgreens in San
Francisco I mean I don't know what I
would have to have as an emergency
before I would park a car
a lot of let's say I don't have a car
but before I'd walk down the street in
San Francisco and enter a Walgreens
no way I'm gonna do that
now I'll buy it online
so how do we put up with this
now by the way I have no information
that would suggest that Jeff Bezos has
asked the Washington Post to do or not
do anything
he may actually be hands off
but that's not good enough because the
employees know what to do
do you think the employees are sitting
there saying let's launch an
investigative report and find out what's
wrong with Amazon
do you think they're running a big
anti-amazon series no they know not to
do you think that they understand that
their boss is better off if there's more
store closings in urban centers of
course they do they know where people
shop
and they know that if they can't shop in
person they shop online everybody knows
that so you don't have to have a
conspiracy or an order from the top to
know that the organization is designed
to make retail stores
disappear
let me say it again
the design of the ownership and
structure of the Washington Post
is designed to largely destroy retail
business in the United States
because the people all know what's good
for their boss
and they know it's not good for their
boss and everybody acts that way it's
the universal truth of employees you
anticipate what your boss wants and you
do more of that and less anything your
boss doesn't like
so how do we
so I would say if you're a retail store
person if you're Nordstrom
The Washington Post is your enemy
and if the Washington Post changed their
suddenly change their coverage and said
we got to get more police we're going to
run opinions on this every day more
police more police we got to stop this
closure of retail stores well then I
would believe them
then I would say oh okay that's just
news and actually good opinion too
but when coincidentally their coverage
and I don't know if this is the case so
I've asked the question but if their
coverage is not every day saying we need
to stop this retail theft because
everybody should be covering it
um you have to wonder about conflict of
interest
well here's a story that uh I'm not sure
I totally understand but I love it
if it's true
so Matt and Gates
uh wants to have Congress call in Jack
Smith to testify on record so you'd be
the one Prosecuting Trump in his his
newer troubles
and
so that's a very aggressive thing to
bring in a prosecutor because if he
refuses they can indict him
right so gase is playing he's playing
Hardball so he's saying you either come
in and say some things that are going to
make you look bad because we're going to
ask questions that'll make it look bad
if you refuse we'll indict you and you
can be like an indicted prosecutor who's
trying to indict somebody that we think
should not be indicted
now that would be awkward right
but there's a better wrinkle this
and I need a fact check on this like I
need a fact Jack on this really badly
because I don't think I fully understand
the story
but I'll tell you what I read
that Matt Gates has a plan to bring in
Trump to testify as a whistleblower
a whistleblower
which would
as part of the deal it would make him
not uh he would not be able to be
prosecuted because part of a
whistleblower deal is if you tell us the
truth about this situation you can't be
prosecuted for the situation you came in
to talk to us about with permission
so if they cleverly say
hey Mr Trump why don't you come in and
talk to us as a whistleblower about the
thing you've been the crimes you've been
charged with
in theory
he could not be charged with the crimes
anymore
because the moment he becomes a
whistleblower and Congress gives him
immunity for the specific charges
now
it's either brilliant or stupid and I
haven't decided yet
is you know brilliant if it could work
and you like it it does have the problem
that the left would just say justice was
not served he's they're treating him
like he's above the law
right now even though the Republicans
would say is not above the law we use
the law we didn't make a law we used an
existing law and it just happened to be
for his benefit
but that's not illegal it's not illegal
to do things completely legally
I don't know if you knew that also if
you give money to people who have to pay
bills
again they'll pay bills
shocking
so
I don't know keep an eye on this one I
have a feeling that he's not going to
execute on this I don't think Trump will
be a whistleblower coming in but
who knows
who knows he's definitely playing
Hardball this is this is an interesting
thinking anyway even if
even if the possibility is low it's
interesting
fine line between stupid and clever
yeah I don't know what you're talking
about
all right
uh whistleblower protections applied to
government employees
all right so so somebody's saying it
applies to government employees
which would mean that Trump is not
technically a government employee
but I wonder if they could stretch it
for somebody who is running for
president who was president
and it still has Secret Service and all
that
I feel like I feel like they could
stretch it and then let the Supreme
Court sort it out
let me ask you this from a from a just
common sense point of view of what feels
to you fair even though fair is not a
real thing but what feels to you fair
would it feel fair that Trump was
treated like a government employee
specifically for The Whistleblower
purposes even though technically not on
the payroll
would would you feel that that was a
reasonable extension of the law
I think I would
I think if that got to the Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court said you know the
law said you have to be an employee he's
definitely not an employee
but in kind
would you say wouldn't you say Trump is
working for the public right now
I mean running for office is what we ask
of people
to you know we asked them to do this
so it's a pretty fine line between being
a government employee and somebody who
was recently president has a really good
chance of being president again and
every day is spending money running for
the presidency because otherwise you
can't have a president
to say that that's not a government
employee I get it technically not but
don't you think the law
was intended
to cover somebody like him
I mean they didn't anticipate it or it
would be in the law but don't you think
that
reasonably that makes sense that he's
the type of person the government wanted
to protect because the government the
reason the reason for whistleblowers
is for the government's benefit not The
Whistleblower
would you agree it's for the
government's benefit so they can get
information
so this is an exact it's a perfect
example that it's a government-ish sort
of guy he's got information that's good
for the government wouldn't Congress
want him to be covered
or anybody in that situation in the
future
because the point is to get the
information
and he's he's as close to being a
government employee as anybody could
possibly be I would say that if somebody
were a contract employee for the
government all right Marcel answer this
question
let's say somebody's a contract employee
so they're not technically employee
would a contract employer who works
every day in the government would they
be covered by The Whistleblower contract
employee yes or no not technically an
employee
yes or no
I would say probably yes
I would say that if it came to the
Supreme Court I would expect the Supreme
Court to rule that they are their their
government employees in in kind
that's close enough
so I would say so just reasoning this
through without any political or without
any legal background at all
uh I would say that
contractors would be covered and then
it's a very small
leap to say that an active candidate
who's at the top of the polling for one
side
should be covered the way a contractor
would be covered you know not quite an
employee but close enough
um what about a retired employee
yeah a retired government employee would
they be covered by The Whistleblower
president is way different yeah
so retired would count right
so is he a retired retired government
employee
so I I guess yeah it depends depends if
that's retired or he just lost his job I
don't know is that the same thing
I suppose you got fired are you retired
I guess so
all right federal employees and
applicants for employees oh so
somebody's saying The Whistleblower act
protects employees and applicants for
employment well there you go
an applicant for employment that's Trump
right
is it is he not an applicant for
employment
I would say that's that's
come on
I hate it when the lawyers disagree with
my totally uninformed opinions
no technically
maybe not but
in kind
are you really agreeing with me or
disagree
don't you think that somebody running
for office is applying for a government
job
to me that sounds sounds like
okay give up
to me it sounds like something the
Supreme Court would agree with
you know a conservative the Supreme
Court at least
all right good that's all I want to hear
that I'm right
all right ladies and gentlemen the video
of UFOs taking flight
uh no I have not seen the video of UFOs
taking flight
uh into another dimension
but I I have seen the uh
the directed energy weapon setting fires
in Hawaii no neither of those are true
if there's anything I would place a
large bet on
oh Scott please change the reality of
the WF to back off on the no privacy
thing
you kid you can't stop the inevitable
whether the wef says your privacy is
going away or not it's going away
just a free market will do it you know
politicians
there's really no way back
we have to adapt it's sort of like you
know maybe the maybe the plan is getting
warmer but the only thing you can do
about it is adapt but we can adapt so
that's fine
privacy is probably going to be the same
thing there's nothing you can do about
losing it in the long run
I'm not saying I want to I'm saying I
can't see anything that would stop it
I see nothing that would stop it in the
long run
same with digital currency nothing's
going to stop that
so I'm often being asked to get involved
in fights that can't be won
because history is only going in One
Direction you know you can maybe slow it
down for a month but it's going in One
Direction and I know when I say that
people think well are you okay with it
I don't know
because I don't know what's going to
happen I don't think we're good at
predicting what happens when there are
big changes like this we could end up
happier
but we don't know that so since we don't
know that I also like you I would
default to preferring privacy
if I can have it I'm going to take it
but I don't think it's an option in the
long run and like you say I lost all my
privacy a long time ago so I I wake up
happy every day
remember how you know they say you'll
lose all your lose your privacy but
you'll be happy
I've lost all of my privacy
do I look unhappy about it somehow I
survive with no privacy
because I just assume that all my
digital stuff is you know people have
access to it
uh I had a situation recently
where somebody who's not me lost the
phone
but the person who's not me had a number
of messages from me
presumably on that phone
there's no such thing as privacy
so everything that you text to anybody
you should assume it will be discernible
so when I heard that somebody lost a
phone which there was some indication
that somebody got into it don't know for
sure but there's some indication that
the password got changed Etc so the
first thing I thought was uh oh I have a
whole lot of private messages on that
phone a lot
and I wasn't worried a bit do you know I
wasn't worried about it
because I would never put something in a
digital message
that would be like some life-changing
problem for me now I would definitely
put things there that would be
embarrassing
but I don't have a risk of embarrassment
because I just can't be embarrassed I
just got over it I I just lost my my
risk of embarrassment it's like a
superpower that nothing embarrasses me
but I'd be worried if something you know
was problematic other than that but I'm
not worried about it at all
there would be surprising things there
might be things that you'd say what
but it wouldn't you know wouldn't change
your life or mine
all right so ladies and gentlemen that's
all I've got for you on this
Beautiful Sunday morning looks like we
went extra long
because I enjoyed being here
there's a difference between
totalitarian lack of privacy though yeah
that's different
um
Biden's burner phone yeah but yeah I
love the fact that the things we know
for sure
are not enough to convince Democrats
that there was something bad happened
and he's got a burner phone
well people have burner phones and a lot
of money went to the big guy well a lot
of people are called big guy you don't
know for her big guy and it was for from
foreign countries that
you know maybe asking for favors but we
don't have any you know direct ask for a
favor well we have lots of Impressions
that he's doing things that they would
like yeah but not any direct
and they send millions of dollars for
nothing in particular well but people do
that sometimes for introductions
my tears
why do I have tears so that there's a
troll on here writing in all caps that
I'm terribly sad about something
can you can you tell me what I'm sad
about
what are all my salty tears about
is there something I don't know about
I'd like to talk to the troll directly
I'm sorry about your low self-esteem
but if your comment about my tears
helped your self-esteem a little bit
gave you gave you a little boost of
attention good for you
good boy good boy
good for you
all right
and now
uh you need a burner phone
okay
what about industrial Secrets those need
protection
um from whom
so a lack of privacy doesn't mean your
neighbors know everything a lack of
privacy could be in just the government
so the government
could know your you know your uh let's
say the secret recipe for Coca-Cola
but they wouldn't care so unless it was
somebody who wanted to you know get it
and sell it or something that would be a
problem
so yeah I can see that you know I also
think that copyright and trademark and
patents will all go away
has anybody said that in public yet
I believe that all intellectual property
protection will disappear
so that people like me could not make
money by making something that's
copyrighted and trying to restrict it
and I think that that will be a uh a
technology and free market kind of
effect it won't be a government decision
until it's until it's just de facto I
think once AI can make anything you want
so today there was a a new Beatles song
starring John Lennon who you know is
long deceased singing a new song that
didn't exist with Paul McCartney doing
backup vocals
and you know it wasn't quite
you know identical identical with human
music but it's pretty close
pretty close
so once AI can make you anything you
want you know once you can say the to
the AI hey
I like a song that's a mashup between
the Rolling Stones and the killers yeah
make me sit and then it can just play it
how are you going to sell music into
that environment
yeah so
so I I have two sort of contrary uh
predictions
one is that people will not enjoy AI art
which I believe to be true because the
reason that you like art
by the way did I blow anybody's mind the
first time I said this if you haven't
heard this before
this should blow your mind
the only reason you like art of any kind
be it music or dancing
or visual art every kind of art the
reason you like it is that you know a
human made it
and that what you're reacting to is
their mating potential
or the collectively they're made of
potential when you watch a Tom Cruise
yeah the Tom Cruise of film
you say to yourself oh I like this
action and the you know it's a good plot
and stuff
but what you're responding to is the
Excellence
from all elements that went into making
it and in particular Tom Cruise's own
Excellence at filmmaking which at this
point is almost unparalleled would you
agree
I don't know if anybody ever has been
better at making a movie than Tom Cruise
ever like I don't think Spielberg's
anywhere in his I think Spielberg makes
crap
and that was for a long time
yeah all the big name directors you know
they're making their three-hour movies
as as Tom Cruise ever ever tortured you
with a three-hour Tom Cruise movie I
don't think he has do you know why
because he's not an
that's why he's not an
he's building a movie that you want to
see
when you watch a Tom Cruise movie every
moment of you you say oh he made this
for me right you know he made it for you
because there's no
the of like oh let me show you
a scene of somebody who's dying from a
real life terrible disease and make you
feel real bad about it and then maybe
you'll feel better when you get to the
end of the movie
Tom Cruise isn't going to make you like
suffer through some tragedy so you'll
feel better at the end
because he's making the movie for you
it's not for himself
I I'm pretty sure that when um
Spielberg made Schindler's List
was that for you
did he say people are gonna love said
through this
they'll feel good when they go home
after this I still have PTSD from
Schindler's List and that's not a joke
I still have recurring
frightening memories of it
now you telling me he made that for me
to be entertained and feel good no no I
mean it was a politically motivated
personal personal kind of project and
I'm all in favor of people doing that I
mean there's nothing wrong with doing it
for any reason he wants it was you know
commercially very successful so all good
but he didn't make that for you
there you know he wasn't thinking as you
said in this audience watching this
movie you're going to feel really good
no nothing like that he made it to get
Academy Awards and accolades and to do
something maybe do something that was
positive for the world
Etc but it wasn't for you
Tom Cruise makes a movie you want to
watch
there's no competition there you use way
above Spielberg
so
um my larger point is that all art is
people collectively or individually
displaying that they have a genetic
qualities skills
that if you were to mate with them your
Offspring might pick up some of that
skill
so that's all our is as soon as AR as
soon as AI is creating the art
and you know it's AI which is the
important part you have to know it's AI
you're going to say oh that's
interesting yeah that hits all the notes
but for some reason it doesn't move me
like I recognize it as music and I can't
even tell you anything wrong with it
but I wouldn't listen to it twice
because you're not being stimulated to
one Abate with the AI you just know it's
just a thing that's doing things so
so that's my uh so I think two things
are going to happen you won't like AI
but yet there will be so much of it that
copyright and intellectual property
become impossible to manage you just
would never be able to protect your
property
so I mean you can tell your AI uh go
read today's Dilbert reborn comic and
write me one that's not Dilbert but it's
the same joke
change the words
and suddenly you got your own comic
so I mean yeah I feel like uh all
copyright IP it's all going to go away
maybe trademark will stay but certainly
copyright and patents will disappear I
think patents have to disappear because
if you've ever tried to run has anybody
tried to do a startup
and that tried to file a patent
and you know what happens
somebody's always filed the patent that
is so broad that it's covered the only
way you can get anything done
in the technology world is if your
lawyers beat the other lawyers
right a startup is about your lawyers
beating the other lawyers because if you
didn't have a lawyer and you didn't find
anything you would launch and then let's
say you got lucky and you had one of the
startups that succeeded it would take 10
minutes
for three other startups to sue you on a
business because they have the you
didn't know it but they have some patent
on something you did
so patterns just make everything
impossible
you know you have to be a good patent
fighter to be a entrepreneur and how
many people are that
so I'm pretty sure patents are just
going to go away
in the long run I mean it might be 20
years 30 years but they're just going to
go away
all right that's all for now I'm going
to talk to you later I've taken too much
of your time already YouTube thanks for
joining we'll see you tomorrow
bye for now
