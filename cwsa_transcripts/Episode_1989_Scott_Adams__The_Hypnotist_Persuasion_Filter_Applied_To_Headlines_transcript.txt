civilization
nothing's ever been better nothing ever
will be but today you're in the perfect
place everything's coming together today
I promise you today will be one of my
best live streams of all time sometimes
the headlines are just made for me today
is one of those days and if you'd like
to join me in a peak experience one of
the best things that's ever happened
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker Chelsea style a canteen jungle
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now in the unparalleled
pleasure that don't mean hit of the day
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sep go
well I love you right back
broker Natalie
we all love each other
well
um have I ever told you that I'm proud
of my prediction from 20 years ago or so
that even a little bit of alcohol isn't
good for you well New York Times has an
article today that I did not bother to
read because the headlines agreed with
me that's that's a good rule of thumb
we know now that the headline of
Articles don't have much correlation to
the actual article
I I don't know when that started but
it's definitely a thing that the
headline of the article don't match so
when I see a headline that I agree with
I don't read the article because that
you know I want to I want to buy into
the headline but if I disagree with the
headline well I'll read the article to
find out the headline is misleading
that's the way I play it how do you play
it
different
all right well here's an example of that
so we can't trust any scientific study I
think we've all learned that but
according to the New York Times even a
little bit of alcohol can harm your
health research shows
now does this mean I'm right
because the newer research agrees with
what I predicted 20 years ago
no unfortunately
unfortunately no but
I do feel as if the uh the tide is
turning
even if it's only the tide of what
they're reporting who knows what the
truth is but it did seem to me that this
was an obvious thing that would happen
in the future
now sometimes you can just predict the
future
by saying what is what is something that
everybody believes to be true
and just predict the opposite
and if you wait long enough somebody's
going to have some science that says you
know everything you believed was true
about
everything
it was all wrong
I think you'd be right about 80 of the
time
you could just pick any topic the
science says is definitely true oh we
all agree this is true and just say it
doesn't and wait 20 years
see what happens you'll look like a
prophet eighty percent of the time
twenty percent of the time
maybe smoking is bad for you and that's
never going to change
everything else subject to
interpretation well I asked this
question
um on social media on Twitter I I asked
this was a poll just for the men
just for the men they asked if the man
had ever ever met a woman met a woman
with fewer problems than their own
UH 60 of the respondents said no that
the women they met
all of them had more problems than they
do all of them apparently Every Woman
they've ever met
but how many men we'll just see how good
you are here
how many men do you think responded that
they have met women
who have fewer problems than they do
oh wow you're really close 26 how do you
do it you're without even seeing the
poll you knew the answer to that
so good so smart
smartest audience ever
yeah 20 26 now here's my hypothesis
behind that
that the way men find happiness and
meaning
is giving women what they want
which usually is directly or indirectly
revolving around procreation and
creating the next uh the Next Generation
women however have a slightly different
operating system
and this is based on my observation
that they have to have more problems
than the guy they're with or at least
present that they do because that's how
they get the Guide to to activate
because the guy isn't going to activate
just on you know a casual preference
maybe but oh I'm going to die if I don't
you know turn up the heat if I don't eat
in 10 minutes
you know I'll be killing somebody
right so have you ever tried to tell a
woman you have a problem
they can top you pretty quickly maybe I
just don't have many problems I don't
know I I wondered for a while if it was
just me I used to think I must have an
unusually small number of problems
I must have I'm there must be something
about me where I've just solved all my
problems and then it occurred to me
maybe I should ask other men
because maybe they're having the same
experience that's why I did the poll
sure enough
men have the impression and again it
would just be an impression and there's
nothing scientific about the poll but
just the impression that the women have
more problems but I think it has more to
do with the the fact that the women's
operating system is to communicate the
problem
in the man's operating system is to look
strong
and to maybe hide the problem
now it probably gets reversed when you
go to the doctor I hear
you know I hear that men are taken more
seriously at the doctor
I mean maybe that could be true
but in general in general would you
agree with the hypothesis
there's no proof here there's no science
but would you agree with that it's a
reasonable hypothesis
that women need to present themselves as
the one with more problems
and that there's nothing wrong with it
it's probably the way everything works
it doesn't necessarily mean it's broken
it's just the way it is
all right well that got you quiet
um
you saw the story it was a few days ago
about the cousin
of one of the black lives matter
Founders uh was stopped by the police
and he seemed to be pretty hopped up on
some drug or combination of drugs and he
resisted arrest if you can call it that
uh by trying to sneak away run away but
he was hallucinating and he was in bad
shape but in the process of resisting
the rest
as it has been interpreted by those who
watch the body cam photos
that he died he got tasered majorly and
he was held down and some combination of
things killed him
now
I read the comments about it and besides
the obvious irony that he's related to
the black lives matter founder
most of the people who saw it said well
what do you expect
if you res you know he was involved in
something that looked
you know like a traffic accident or
something maybe criminal they weren't
sure but he resisted rest
what are they supposed to do
what are the police supposed to do well
I have a suggestion based on persuasion
it looked like the the police officers
were was doing everything he could
to take this guy who is obviously in a
psychotic episode whether it was any
part was natural we don't know but at
the very least he was probably on drugs
so the police officer was trying to keep
this Frame of the real world
all right what is real what is not real
well this guy's in full out
hallucination
are you surprised that a police officer
who tried to keep things in the realm of
what's real
didn't get a good outcome with somebody
who was fully hallucinating
that should not be a surprise
what'd it looked like to me
is a gap in training and I'm not I'm not
going to say undertrained I'm not going
to say undertrained because they're
probably trained up
but I feel like there's a gap and here's
the Gap from the field of hypnosis
all right how would a hypnotist have
handled that same situation how would I
have handled it I'll tell you if I had
been that police officer the moment I
realized that my frame of what is true
and real
according to me didn't have any impact
on the person what do you do when you
know that you can't bring the person
into your frame
what do you do
here's what a hypnotist does
you join their frame
you joined the frame
if you can't get them to your frame you
have to join their frame because what
you don't want to do is be in different
frames that's how somebody gets killed
here's how I do it I'm forgetting some
of the crazy stuff you're saying
but he was saying that people were
trying to kill him
and he was saying they needed some water
and he needed things right
so the police officer was was doing what
looked like a really professional job of
keeping his cool
being consistent and firm
but he didn't get what he wanted and
then things went off the rails
um
here's what he could have done
he could have entered the frame this is
what I would have done and I have done
this in lots of situations not obviously
a dangerous one but in lots of
situations you just sent to the frame
here's how you do it somebody's trying
to kill you
all right here's what we're going to do
I'm gonna I'm gonna look like I'm
arresting you and you'll be safe
yeah yeah yeah I know so I let's let's
do this as quickly as possible get in
the car get in the car I think
somebody's after you I think I saw
somebody I I believe you I believe you
quick make it look like you're getting
arrested we'll get you in the car we'll
get you to safety as soon as possible
and then you can talk to us and we'll
help you out
that's entering the that's how you enter
the illusion
now let's say you said uh but I need
water I need water right now you say oh
God yeah you look dehydrated let's get
shoes of water as soon as possible yeah
yeah let's get you some water can uh
we've got some water coming
can you sit down here wait for it the
water's coming
right now those are you know just the
quick off the top of my head examples
but what it looks to me
is that the police officer is not
trained without specific technique
right
have you ever have you ever heard of a
police officer trained to enter an
illusion I've never seen it in action
but you know I haven't seen every police
stop in the world
yeah it feels like a gap in the training
and the reason I'm not going to say
they're under trained is because I doubt
that's ever been offered
like I doubt there's anything in the
police curriculum or training that would
cover that very specific recommendation
anyway so I just put that out there
um I saw on a Mike serovich feed
um he was talking about
there's some science apparently this has
been well known for a long time
it's been well known for a long time
that if you get a heart transplant
is common to take on the personality of
the person who donated the heart
what
did you know that
I I didn't know that until just recently
apparently it's well understood
by people who do you know organ
transplants it's just a known thing
now here's what I would like to add to
that conversation
if you think that your your body or
yourself is a mind
this one thing does all the thinking and
then a body is a separate thing that
does the moving and of course they work
together you know the mind tells the
body what to move if that's your view of
a human
it's very incomplete
and misleading
here's my view of a human
all of this is your brain it's all your
brain
because your personality will completely
change based on what's Happening to your
body
right if you're hungry your brain goes a
different way if you're angry I'm not
angry if you're cold
uh if you're horny
if you're sick
if you're like this poor gentleman who
died in the traffic stop if you're
agitated right and and I often tell you
that I use my body as a sensor to know
how to write humor and this is the
advantage that humans have over AI when
I'm when I'm going through the potential
jokes I could write
I'm not mentally deciding if they're
good
mentally I'm just deciding if they have
the the joke form
but deciding if it's funny I do with my
body
I actually monitor my body and say okay
did I guffaw did I laugh out loud did I
have a reaction did I have any kind of
physical experience
so for me the the brain and the body are
just always working as one to think
to me my body is thinking all the time
so when people talk about you know I
have a gut feeling I think that actually
comes from
some kind of you know Shadow
understanding that your body actually is
brain it's part of your brain yeah in so
many ways the body is the brain and if
you think of it that way and that would
be a reframe if you think of it that way
I think it explains more
right it'll explain more of your
observations of life
all right that was interesting
um here's another persuasion related
suggestion
you know obviously uh drug addiction is
a huge problem in this country and we
don't have any way to deal with that
we have lots of rehabs and programs but
they're unfortunately not that
successful like a really good success
rate for Rehab would be
you tell me
what what would any one rehab facility
what ratio what percentage of people
leave the rehab and then never drink
it's really low right and I'm thinking
10 20
tops 10 20 percent
somebody's saying 75 but I don't think
so I think it's 75 when they walk out
the door but it doesn't take long to
fall back into it
yeah I'm feeling this in the 20 range
now here's what I think they get wrong
when you try to make a drug addict
recover
you take them to a terrible environment
rehab
you take away all their entertainment
their phones or iPads and stuff you take
away all their access to their friends
and their loved ones you and you give
them a boring little room you know it
might be worse than when they have at
home so basically you take away all
their sources of pleasure as well as the
drugs
and then you say Hey how do you like
that how do you like it without the
drugs but also also without any other
affordable pleasure
how did we think that would ever work
to me that's that is how you designed uh
you would design the system to make
somebody an addict
right if you wanted to turn somebody
into an addict
I would say all right here's your life
without without the drugs
we take away all your funds and here's
your life with the drugs not only do you
have the drug fund fund but all the
other fun
that you know if you have any fun
so here's what I would do instead
I I wouldn't do a rehab building you
know like a like a one
house I think you need to build a town
a rehab town
it needs to be walled off
and absolutely nothing gets in and you
would literally have to be watching for
drones and people throwing stuff over
there so you'd have to you'd have to
drug test everybody once a week
and if if you get drugs inside those
City walls you got to be gone like that
that's got to be you know no mercy if
you don't pass the drug test so you have
a you have a little town but you make
the town way better
than normal people's life
it's just beautiful
there's something to do there's a place
to walk there's a nice maybe nice gym
you get people organized so that they're
doing things with each other they're
meeting some people making some
connections and they they get a taste of
what it could be
if they did everything right and didn't
have alcohol
now in theory
it should make you say you know the best
the best year of my life was in a rehab
town you know whatever that's called the
best year of my life I remember
Mike Tyson
he said the the best years of his life
were in prison
because it cleared his mind for the
first time ever now I don't think he
literally meant that
but there's something to it yeah there's
something to having an environment
that's right for the situation
so
here's here's my um so Catherine says
unrealistic so I don't disagree with
that
all of the treatments for everything you
can do about drug addiction is
unreasonable that's the problem we don't
have any ideas that we know work so what
I would do is try everything
try everything
I know uh Michael schellenberger and and
others have said you really have to you
know force people into treatment it's
the only thing we know that works and
what doesn't work is giving them
open-air free drugs
I think there's still stuff to test in
the domain of legalization
I think that I think there's probably a
right way and a wrong way to do it the
wrong way to do it is to have a place
where everybody hangs out that feels
like exactly the wrong way to do it
potentially a right way to do it would
be to say all right you're a you're a
drug addict
at risk but you also hold down a job and
you have a family
so we're not going to treat you like
everybody else we're gonna say for you
let's try this for you it's going to be
legal and we're going to give you a
clean source of supply and also all the
you know resources for breaking the
addiction if you want to but you're
going to have to do it on your own
have to do it on your own we're not even
going to try to get you into rehab but
we will make sure that you don't get any
bad drugs we'll just make sure you got
clean Supply just see what happens
now if you say Scott Scott you don't
understand anything about
lives or addicts or something that
wouldn't work
I'm saying you're answering the wrong
question
the question is not yes or no will it
work the question is are we really that
smart
that we know in advance everything
that'll work it's not about how you
implemented it it's always about the
idea and it's obvious that no you have
to test stuff you might surprise
yourself
and you might surprise yourself because
you're testing one thing and maybe it
doesn't work out but somebody involved
is smart and they try like something
within the thing and then accidentally
you've discovered something that worked
you know that's how life works you got
to do something right you're not going
to solve it by not doing anything
because you don't know what to do just
try some stuff
try legalization in a variety of forms
the open air thing looks crazy I
wouldn't try that again
uh but uh but I'm glad it was tried I'm
glad it was dry and I'm glad that
Michael schellenberger shot it down when
it didn't work you know largely he was
it was the biggest part of that
so I don't mind trying stuff that
doesn't work
because we don't know what works
all right uh here's some more persuasion
theme and part of my theme of Defending
people who can't defend themselves
right I'm now going to defend yet
another person
that most of you are really mad at and
then I'm going to do it again
at least two of them today
and I'm going to defend the first one
because he does not have Twitter access
at the moment Sam Harris
now I was alerted to a Sam Harris video
in which the person tweeting it said oh
my god there he is saying that he wishes
more kids had died from covid so we take
covert more seriously
and then people would get the
vaccinations if only if only children
were dying
okay now here's the first question this
is this is the persuasion filter
if the only thing you heard
was that Sam Harris said he wishes more
children had died
what should be your first reaction to
that
horror would horror be your first
reaction
or would your first reaction be
obviously that never happened like
obviously obviously that never happened
but there was there was the video
there was a video and there was the
summary of it
and there were all the comments say yeah
there it is
so he said it right
he must have said it because all those
people heard it
I mean a lot of people saw it and it
wasn't wasn't edited it didn't look like
it looked like he really said it
so I read it myself
nothing like that was in the article in
the in the video
absolutely nothing like that
now to be close
and and so I called it out and said uh
the video doesn't have anything like
that in it
and then people said yes it does what
are you crazy
yes it does
but it doesn't
it doesn't
here's what he said
now I'm going to paraphrase it so these
are my words but this is what I heard
what I heard again this is just me
paraphrasing what I think he said
what I heard was the the nature of the
virus
it makes it especially difficult to
manage in a public way
and here's why because the group that is
most targeted uh the the virus targets
old people
and so you can never be sure was it the
virus
or was it not and therefore public
discourse is gets confused because some
people say well maybe they're just dying
anyway
maybe it's not coveted
you're not really sure so so it's really
hard to create a public policy because
there's some ambiguity about who's at
risk and then are they counting the
numbers right and all that now here was
his point
hypothetically and it wasn't a
preference for God's sakes he said
hypothetically if this virus had been
preferentially killing children how
would we treat it
we would say we don't care if the
science is right or wrong
we would not care about the science if
you saw children dying at the rate that
the older people were dying we we would
have just done whatever we had to do
and his argument was that a lot of
people who were anti-vaxx to say of
Grandma
if you said all right do you want to get
take this vaccination that you don't
feel this you know fully trustworthy
do you want to take a you know a sketchy
thing to save Grandma who's 80
what does a reasonable person say
a reasonable person says maybe not right
some say yes and that's also reasonable
but you could certainly be reasonable
and say you know Grandma's only got two
more years
but that's a big thing to put in me and
have me worry about it for the rest of
my life
right because here's what people forget
people forget that your mental state is
part of your health because again they
separate brain and body like they're two
different things it's just one machine
they're just the same thing if if you
have a serious serious concern
about your own safety from a vaccination
so-called vaccination
that is part of your health
right why would I want to give you a
mental problem
to have you less chance of a you know a
serious virus
I'm not even sure that would make sense
medically would it and here's what the
medical community gets totally wrong
about what I'll call the anti-vaxxers
they're completely ignoring
the fact that their mental state you
know what they feel about the risk what
they feel about being abused what they
feel about having their rights taken
away what they feel about having
something put in their arm they don't
want
like that is also their health
it's not just their body
so the moment the moment you say your
health is just your body and what
happens to grandma you've ignored a huge
huge part of the medical decision which
is what's it going to do to your brain
I mean psychologically not even not even
Spike protein wise
right
so
I think that Sam Harris made an
interesting point
that I found was a added value in a
philosophical way but has no bearing on
what's happening today right it does it
doesn't tell you to do anything
differently it's sort of an interesting
point but nowhere nowhere did he say he
had some preference for children dying
from the virus
if you really had to listen to it to
know he didn't say that you have to ask
yourself
have you been too hypnotized by the The
Narrative like to imagine he actually
said that in in public one of the most
let's say careful speakers and best
communicators of our time somebody who's
totally tapped into
you know what what things sound like
when you say them there's no way he said
that it's crazy both people saw it
because people see what they're priming
to see so that's your persuasion lesson
um
you know who's having a great week
Mack Yates and weirdly Kevin McCarthy at
the same time
I I cannot be I don't think I could tell
you how impressed I am that Matt Gates
turned the ship around for his own his
own political fortunes I did not see
that coming
honestly I thought he was he was done
but not only is he cleared of all the
accusations
uh you know at least in a legal sense
he's cleared of all accusations but his
move to force McCarthy to give you know
the the some Republicans what they
wanted totally was successful and then
what do we have now they're
um Gates was on Tucker talking about how
happy he was that Kevin McCarthy had
decided to release the all of the
January 6 footage which is something
Republicans have been asking for for a
long time and apparently that wasn't
even part of what they negotiated
so so Matt Gates is on Tucker Carlson
saying Kevin McCarthy is doing a great
job
apparently they're friends now or at
least you know working colleagues so I
don't think it gets better than that as
if you're a Republican
have you ever been happier with your
party than to watch the you know the
gates group fight McCarthy all
transparent you you got to watch it all
it was a serious fight over serious
things the the net outcome was an
improvement according to Republicans and
then
they became friends again and they
started working like colleagues now I
don't know how much they like each other
personally but clearly they could now
work together they've now shown each
other the level of respect
that both of them earned
I think they both earned the respect
that each is giving them and then you're
seeing a good outcome at the moment so
wow has anybody have a better week than
both McCarthy and Gates and they had
this good week because they fought
but they did it honestly right it was an
honest fight and it was it was well
fought it was a hard fight it was
everything you want
um now let's talk about everything you
don't want
Mike Pompeo tweeted weak border policies
on the root cause of our fentanyl crisis
[Music]
no Mike Pompeo that is disqualifying
Assuming he's running for president
that's totally disqualifying
how could he hold the jobs that he's
held and know nothing about Fentanyl or
does he understand fentanyl but doesn't
want to deal with it seriously
it's all disqualifying
Trump says directly now of course
there's a question of whether he'd do it
but Trump says directly he wants to
spend the Special Forces him to kick the
 out of the cartels and Mike Pompeo
is saying like let's make that wall a
little stronger it's like he doesn't
understand the weight of fentanyl you
could literally just toss it over the
wall it's like the size of a baseball
and it's enough to kill a city
so
border security is maybe 10 of it
maybe 10 percent
and it's worth doing I'm I'm a hundred
percent behind strong borders
but
we can't have a president whose
understanding of one of the biggest
issues that we have is so thin
or that he's you know misrepresenting
his opinion either one of those is
disqualifying so now do you see the
point of being a single issue voter
is weirdly powerful
because I can I can direct fire as
something specific is now my job to make
sure that Mike Pompeo does not get
anywhere in the primary and it's only
this issue
because I actually think he's pretty
strong
he seems like a pretty credible
stray shooter you know otherwise
otherwise I like them a lot actually
there would be plenty of things to
criticize with all of them but generally
speaking I was I saw him as a serious
candidate but now now I can't I can't
take him seriously this was a horrible
mistake now it's one that he could
correct because you saw that Trump also
has evolved on this I think Trump has
evolved Less on his thinking because I
think he probably always wanted to be
tough on the cartels but I think he's
evolved it in terms of what he's willing
to say out loud
so I think he's got a little cover for
saying that now
all right
so Mike Pompeo I think I hope he evolves
on that
um
you know
let me ask you this question
when the stories first came out about uh
the documents that Joe Biden had that
were classified sprinkled around
am I the first person you heard saying
it sounded like a Democrat op to get rid
of Joe Biden because now a lot of people
are saying it and I'm not saying that I
influence the other people
uh that that's not my claim I didn't
influence the people the people that I
see saying it don't look like they're
people who had been exposed to me uh so
you saw people say before I said it
so I'm just wondering did did people
spontaneously have the same feeling
how about you personally did you
spontaneously even before anybody said
it did you say oh my God this looks like
an OP
a lot of yeses okay all right good good
because it seemed to me that this was
the sort of thing that a lot of people
would have the same reaction because
you've now been primed
you know now you now know what an OP
looks like
right you know how complicated they
could be you know how common they are
and now you feel like you've seen the
pattern right there's a bit of a pattern
about it yeah
um
but the interesting thing about this is
it might be a twofer that I just
realized today now tell me if you've
heard this before so this is a slight
spin on that just a slight one that it
looks like a Democrat op to get rid of
Biden before the primaries but it also
looks like it's designed to protect
Trump so he's their preferred uh
bogeyman candidate
right the twofer is that if Biden is
being accused of these document troubles
then there's no way that Trump can get
into the maximum trouble himself like
it's going to make it all look like oh
people do this it's just something that
happens
right now
I'm not I'm going to stop short of
saying that it's a clever
uh plot I'll just say it looks like one
would you accept that we don't really
know
you know who's behind what but it looks
like one
now um who did I just see
who who just appeared uh helped me who
was just on smirkanish
um some prominent Republican was just on
Smerconish
okay that's right yeah case so Gates
just think about this
Matt Gates just had a very successful
appearance on CNN
he's now the only person who can do CNN
and Fox News
I I mean nobody has ever had a week this
good that I could remember like
politically
yeah if Gates can do a good job on CNN
as well as
presents a good job on Fox News and he
did both
he did both
this week Noah who else has ever done
that
like ever
I've never seen it I've never seen it
now Matt Gates quite wisely tweeted the
interview and he said that smirkanish
was really fair
and that he thinks you know CNN might be
actually changing for the better
I would like to modify that comment
because you remember I've also said this
merconish is the the most Fair
interviewer on CNN
I mean my experience with burkanish was
that you did you did play it down the
middle I was a little annoyed once when
the producer had invited me on and I
said yes and then they also invited on a
Critic of mine after I said yes
not cool
because the critic just you know uses up
the time and you don't have time to
respond so you basically just get slimed
off camera but I have a feeling that had
more to do with the producers than some
reconnaiss because my feeling about
superconish is he's actually a good dude
who's trying to do the right thing for
the country
and he just happens to be in CNN so I'm
not sure that merconish is a sign that
CNN is improving
it's more of a sign that this American
does a good job I think
but uh maybe both maybe maybe season is
Improvement because CNN is going pretty
hard about this document thing wouldn't
you agree
so it's either part of the plot to get
rid of Biden
or they're just
playing the new Straight
might be one of those they would look
the same
all right
um I've got an idea
well first of all I have a theory for
why so many documents classified
documents keep being found by Biden I
believe
this is just speculation
but I believe that Biden
wherever he goes he likes to leave a
trail of classified documents because
sometimes that's the only way he can
find his way back
so I think we're going to find you know
not just documents but we might find
like an ant Trail
all the way from Delaware to the White
House I'm just speculating I don't know
just just trying to figure out why
there's so many of them that's all
all right
um now how did we get this far
without knowing what the documents are
about
right
how do we don't you think that somebody
should have said all right we can't show
you the documents but we've looked at
them and they're either terrible or
they're nothing
so here's what I suggest I think that
Biden's classified documents should be
collected up and then put them in a
skiff
the skiff is at a really highly secure
place where you can't take a picture you
can't bring your phone in can't take a
copy just have to read it where it is in
that little little skiff that building
and I think that they should put those
documents in a skiff and then get
somebody like Adam Schiff for example
have Adam Schiff look at them and then
tell us if we should be worried
because I feel like you look at them say
oh there's nothing here at old
and then everything's fine
because if you can't believe Adam Schiff
who can you believe
all right
that would be an example of jokes that
don't need punch lines
that's a joke that doesn't need a
punchline because
Schiff is the punchline I guess all
right
so here we know now the following things
or maybe we don't I still think it's a
little early to know if all the facts
are right so maybe some of these facts
are wrong about Biden in the documents
but here's what we think we know
that he had some of these documents in
his garage
and here's the part I need to fact check
on
that Hunter Biden was renting the whole
home
during that period
for forty nine thousand dollars a month
is that confirmed
or is that just
internet BS
is that confirmed that he was renting it
during the period those documents were
there
I know we've heard it but is it true
404 Jam confirmed it
yeah
I don't know
so here's what uh if it's true and I I
have a question on that so if it's true
um shouldn't the rental payments be
shown on Joe Biden's tax returns
I don't think they are
I don't think they're there
so
he goes to jail right
like what else could it be if it's true
that Hunter was paying him 49 000 a
month and it's also true he didn't put
in his tax returns
he goes to jail
like actual jail
like no doubt about it jail
am I wrong
somebody do a fact check on me
if it's not on his tax returns
and he actually did have a lease
agreement and actually collected 49 000
a month
he would have known he was cheating on
his taxes for sure
you go to jail
yeah now why would he not put it on his
tax returns because at some point you'd
probably want to you know maybe launder
it or something so it's good to get it
taxed and keep what you can
why wouldn't he well I have a possible
explanation and again just to be clear
none of this is confirmed
I'm not positive there was ever a rental
agreement I'm not positive it happened
at the same time as the documents and
I'm not positive it's not on the tax
returns but those are the facts that
preliminary we think are true
um to me it looks like
to me it looks like a major crime
if anybody had put uh I got six hundred
thousand dollars a year
from renting my house
don't you think that would have been a
red flag
if you had put those real numbers if
they were real numbers
um
uh I see somebody's got a document there
but tell me what that says so I don't
have to open it
if you rent it to your child it's still
taxable
um or or if it's not then it's a gift
tax
right if you treat it as a gift and it's
over ten thousand dollars a year or 15 I
think now you still have to record it on
your taxes as a gift
yeah yeah so here's why I think it could
not be on the taxes because we would
have already known about it
right
we would already know about
so probably not on the taxes so
if this is what it looks like
then the Democrats really did take him
down they really did I mean I don't know
how you can explain it any other way but
I think we might find
um
yeah imagine being the Biden accountant
right now that would be awkward uh so I
guess my main thing is if if this is
true then we have found how a 100 by
laander's money to his father the big
guy gets him is 10 percent
I think it's all laid out at this point
it looks like their entire criminal
Enterprise is now transparent
and it was accidental because we
wouldn't have found out about this if
it's true I guess I have to keep saying
if it's true maybe I should back off
oh you know what I'm gonna do
I I have to be consistent I have to be a
little bit consistent I told you I'm
going to defend people who can't defend
themselves
Hunter Biden's not on Twitter right
true Hunter Biden is not on Twitter
I think that's true or he's not tweeting
much if he is
um
I don't like the quality of the
information I'm talking about
so I'm going to give him an innocent
until proven guilty
okay I think that has to be the standard
right so let's give him this let's give
him that now
if the information that has been
reported is true then I would drop the
Assumption of Innocence
to me that would look obviously guilty
but it has to be these facts have to be
true right there really has to be a
lease agreement there really has to be
the transfer of money and it really has
to not be on his taxes like all those
things need to be true and then you can
see it all
but I don't know yet so let's let's keep
an open mind
it's hard to
but it's a good standard to try to
maintain
um
there's more reports of UFOs
so there were 350 reports of
unidentified stuff and something like
half of them they figured out they were
balloons and plastic bags that somehow
got into the atmosphere
the rest were unexplained
Now The Unexplained ones over a hundred
of them unexplained 100 recent ones
unexplained they have this weird quality
where they can they'll be moving in One
Direction and suddenly they'll change
directions
and you know you know that that would be
a violation of physics right because if
you had a it's moving like I don't know
100 miles an hour or something and then
suddenly it just like goes in the other
direction
obviously
that will be violating physics right I
wonder
I wonder if there's any kind of object
that could be in the air
that could be going in One Direction
within the within the rules of our
existing physics could be traveling at a
high speed in One Direction and then
suddenly reverse speed and going the
other way
it could be
let's see let's put together what we
know so the ones they've confirmed are
not spacecraft are
plastic garbage bags
and balloons
if only we could think of something that
could change direction quickly in the
air
without violating any rules of physics
well I've got nothing
it's plastic bags people
it's it's plastic bags
clearly
clearly is plastic bags
we think we're being invaded by an
advanced species or it's just our
plastic bags
yeah it's a blue yeah now as soon as I
saw that most of them are balloons and
bags
and that whole thing about the the
physics being impossible I thought the
physics are impossible if you make the
Assumption it's a spacecraft
if you start with the Assumption it's a
spacecraft well yeah it can't move that
way if you start with the Assumption
it's a plastic bag it can go any
direction really quickly just have to
have a different wind
why is the military promoting it because
they believe they're spacecraft
I think to people promoting it believe
it
the lights
the the all the ones that they show that
like the uh the sensor readings of I
don't I don't know what you'd call IT
cameras I guess but they don't have
lights the Tic-Tac ones
no the ones that look the most
convincing they don't have any lights
the ones that look the least convincing
like their hoaxes or their airplanes or
stuff
those have lights
yeah
now I would love
for UFOs to be real if they're not here
to you know use us for food
um well I don't think so
I'm going to make a really big bet
that in my lifetime there will be no
confirmation of spaceships
and that that would be hard
because we got cameras everywhere we
can't get one clear picture of a
of a UFO and every time we get a clear
picture oh it's a bag it's a balloon
so let me get this straight all of the
clear photography
is a balloon or a bag
and all of the
uh vague photography might be an
advanced alien Armada coming to Earth
plastic bag
alien Armada
one of those is more likely than the
other
more likely
I'm being asked how do I like my Crow
because I'll be eating some Crow
allow me to commit to you commit to you
the following
I would be so happy
like if we found out there were space
aliens or some kind of aliens who are
not dangerous
I would love that
I would love that
and I would eat all the crow you want
no not Mike Rowe this sounds like my
Crow no not that
but yeah I'd be I'd happily grow so and
here's here's why I say that one of the
things I'll teach you in my new book is
that if you commit to who you are too
strongly and then you find out you're
wrong about something that's how you get
into cognitive distance because you're
trying to make some compatibility with
who you think you are and who you've
presented yourself to the public with
what is what is actually happening
so if I were to present myself as
flawless
in my predictions and then I get one
wrong I would be triggered into
cognitive distance so I don't do that
I tell you that if I'm wrong about this
I will love it
and that makes me pretty much immune
from cognitive distance because I have a
good outcome either way I would love to
find their aliens love it
and I also like to be right
two good things
I win either way so as long as I win
either way I don't have the trigger for
cognitive distance maybe a little
confirmation bias everybody has that but
not in cognitive distance
all right uh
do you remember me saying that winter
was going to be tough for the Russian
soldiers because it seemed to me that
the ukrainians would just fly drones
over their Battlefield
and the drones would just wait until the
Russians had to go back to their
Barracks because they had to be indoors
for the winter or for the for the night
and I said
isn't the winter going to be a whole
bunch of Russians walking into Barracks
just before the barracks explode
and now we're seeing videos of exactly
that
exactly that yeah they you actually see
these the uh the soldiers the Russian
soldiers you know like 20 of them
heading toward a building
one assumes that there are more of them
in that building because that's probably
some kind of a you know Barracks or
headquarters or something so the
ukrainians instead of killing the 20
where they see them they just follow
with the Drone you watch the the walk
into the building and then they call it
the strike and the building blows up
now I've seen two videos of that so far
now that's just the videos we've seen so
I'm not sure if we see all of them but
that does appear to be a strategy would
you not would you agree
would you agree that that's clearly a
strategy at this point
right
I don't know how that strategy loses
can't they see troop movements really
easily in the winter there's no there's
no leaves
it looks to me that if you have any kind
of aerial Advantage you can see
everybody moving everywhere
like at night bad weather you know like
all you have to wait is for a day your
drone can fly and you know exactly where
their Barracks are and then you make it
disappear I don't know how they're going
to be any Russians left by the end of
the winter
am I wrong that that was the obvious
tactic and that and the Ukraine is
apparently optimizing
now I think it might be different on the
Ukrainian side
because I'll bet they're distributed
better
and it may be that the Russians have
fewer
um good surveillance Tech I don't know
that for sure
yeah
all right uh now let me say for the
pro-russia trolls
there is no way to know who will lose or
who will win in the long run
any amount of you know temporary
Ukrainian victories have to be weighed
against the fact that Russia might be
willing to take as long as it takes
so no you cannot know who will win are
you happy
and you should also not believe anything
that comes out of Ukraine
are we good
okay I don't see much complaining on
that
all right so Russians took this uh town
called solidar
and it's a big fight and part of the
story is that the the Wagner group
um is fighting there and I guess
somebody claimed that they had conquered
it before they had so they had to try
extra hard to actually conquer it with a
lot of losses and anyway so whether or
not Russia has conquered it let's say
they do
have you seen pictures of solidar
there's nothing left
it's just Rubble
doesn't matter if Russia captures Rubble
because what would Ukraine do
let me suggest what they would do
so Ukraine let's say Ukraine poles out
of solidar there's nothing left right
there's nothing to protect there's
nothing left what would Russia do
well they have to occupy it or else they
didn't really
conquer it how will they occupy it
will all the Russian soldiers you know
take like one square mile and sleep
alone
probably not
they're probably going to Bunch up in
little groups and March toward their
barracks and the ukrainians will blow
and their Barracks will just be rubble
and then the ukrainians will blow off
the rubble and and so solidar will just
turn into a killing field
because there's no place to hide and
there's nothing the ukrainians wouldn't
be willing to blow up
because there's nothing but Rubble
when I say nothing but Rubble I mean
actually literally nothing but Rubble
there's nothing there
so
what does it mean to control that it
just means that you're holding on to a
piece of land that makes you just easy
targets
like there's nothing predictable about
any of this stuff
all right Polish Polish ukrainians yeah
uh what's that the news flash we won
yeah we won the Cold War we did yeah I
think so
all right uh Pfizer is seeing a signal
in the data for strokes from the
boosters not the first two but the
boosters for older people
and here's what they said this is kind
of interesting
I assume this is a confidence building
kind of move they're saying that only
one study showed that there might be a
signal for a problem
and they said that they don't see the
signal in other countries
they don't see it in the U.S Department
of Veteran Affairs records which tend to
be pretty good and they don't see it in
the fairs
so they're actually reporting a risk of
their own product
that even the varis system hasn't picked
up
now that's either
super
um
let's say super reasonable on their on
their part
or it's just pure
manipulation it's one of those two
things because I have a feeling to say
you know at the at the first sign at the
first sign of anything wrong we we did
the maximum amount of protecting but
then we looked into a deeper and found
out there was nothing there
so I think in the end they're going to
magically Proclaim they saw nothing
but they're going to say look
we we follow up on every little thing
so if you think there's something we
haven't followed up on just look at this
see that was something we didn't even
need to tell you was so small such a
small signal probably not even real
so I think that's just positioning and
persuasion
that's what it looks like
yeah yeah the pr people told them to
admit and apologize so that they would
have a small admission
and maybe a small apology and then say
whoops sorry we were wrong about that
being a signal turns out it's perfect so
I think that's what's going to happen
which is which has nothing to do with
whether it's safe or not
I saw some
um
some insurance actuary uh stuff on perio
no I'm sorry carditis
what's it called carditis
why am I forgetting periocarditis anyway
um
myocarditis sorry yeah myocard is and
now this was a one small insurance
company is data I'm not going to mention
the insurance company or where I got it
for now
um but it seemed to indicate again we
don't believe data right any data about
the pandemic is sketchy but it seemed to
show that young people were having more
myocarditis
similar to other information and it
looked pretty
like a pretty big deal
you know I think the the scale of it
maybe was misleading but there did seem
to be a clear spike in younger people
but here's the interesting part
uh at age 65 and older this Spike just
disappeared
like zero
now why is that interesting
there's a very small chance
this is very preliminary
that I totally guessed right
right remember I told you from the
beginning we're all guessing but some of
us imagine that you know we have
knowledge of things we can't now we're
all guessing
so if I guess right I'm not going to
take any credit
because it was a guess
likewise if I got it wrong and I died of
a clot I still won't say I was wrong
I'll say we were all guessing I guess
wrong
right so I either guessed right or I
guess wrong but I was definitely
guessing right now if you would like to
say and many of you did Scott I wasn't
guessing
because I wasn't trusting these people
that was right
and here we are
okay so I'll just talk about me
I was guessing right but it looks like I
guess the same as Dr Robert Malone one
of the co-inventors of the MRNA site and
oh I also I also did not choose which
vaccination
because my health care provider didn't
give me a choice they're just like
you're getting vaccinated don't ask us
which one until they put it into your
arm basically so I didn't
you know so I did the same thing Dr
Malone did I got the first two
vaccinations
primarily because I wanted to travel
internationally that's why he did it
that's why I did it specifically why I
also waited as long as possible
because most of the bad outcomes happen
soon
so after six months of seeing if there
were excess people dropping dead my age
I took the I took the leap now
does that mean that
I should get a booster
no because everything's changed right
like it's Omicron now and you know we
know that it doesn't have any protective
value and blah blah
um oh I'm sorry we know that it doesn't
stop infections
but let's talk about protective value
that's a separate category
um in the news
which is totally believable
we all believe the news according to CNN
largely funded by big Pharma
um more than a quarter of kids who get
coveted May develop long-term symptoms
hmm let me see if I can connect the dots
CNN a news organization
that's funded largely by big Pharma
because all the news is
um
they've decided that they they somehow
magically can know how many kids have
long covet
when long covid is
a totally vague set of symptoms
that is hard to identify
a little sketchy isn't it
it feels as if the news narrative
coincidentally fits exactly what the
their sponsors would like to hear
because you can also find on Google so I
went to Google
and yes we know that the so the the
social media platforms are biased on all
the medical stuff so I went there to see
what Google would say about the
so-called vaccinations
and I asked that
does the so-called vaccination without
the so-called part does it protect you
against long covet and do you know what
Google says
oh yeah
oh yeah that vaccination will protect
you against that law and covet and 25
percent of kids are getting that long
covet that's really bad it's really bad
don't you wish you had a vaccination so
you wouldn't get that long covet now
how are we supposed to think that's a
 coincidence
I do not apologize for swearing
you needed that you needed that I'm just
going to do one that's it and we're done
all right
how in the world are we supposed to
believe that
how in the world
now I'm not saying it's not true
I'm not saying that the vaccination
doesn't protect you from long covet I'm
just saying that's a big ask
isn't it
that's a big ask because first of all I
don't exactly see the mechanism by which
that would be true
I mean if if it doesn't stop infection
if it does keep you from getting the
worst of symptoms which I'm not even
sure that's true yeah maybe that could
make sense
if your initial covid was not as bad as
it could have been
because of the vaccination again that
would be something I'm not sure is true
but that would at least give you an
explanation why they might protect you
because you don't get it so bad in the
first place yeah Maybe
but
it does seem like it's presented to us
as a fact
I'm not sure that's a fact
what do you think
do you think that's a fact
or do you think it's just pure narrative
because it's good for the pharmacist
and interestingly they say there's no
drug for long covet
now I'm sure that there's drugs in the
pipeline
but that's also basically just trying to
get you to get vaccinated right oh you
better get vaccinated so you don't get
that long covered now
oh
uh I'm just going to throw this in the
mix I don't believe this is true right
so so here's a fake news that somebody
injected into the conversation and I and
it made me laugh because it's just the
perfect fake news are you ready for this
it's fake news as far as I know
you know those unexplained deaths that
happened about the same time as the
vaccinations
somebody said it happened about the same
time people were taking
hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin and
they're saying it's probably the
hydroxychloroquine that killed them now
you're right right the the odds of that
being true are pretty low because those
are such such well-tolerated uh well
tolerated things but I think it's funny
that anybody would even try to inject
that into the conversation at this point
and to me that's just funny I can't take
that too seriously
yeah all right so don't take that
seriously at all
um
uh
so here's what the uh the new CNN said
about the long covet
all right so there was a I guess sort of
a meta study if you could call it that
they don't call it a meta-analysis so
maybe it was just a review which would
be different than a meta-analysis so
seven articles showed an improvement in
Long coveted symptoms
after at least one dose of vaccination
so there's seven articles
articles interesting not seven studies
but seven articles
what's an article
somebody wrote about their opinion
don't we need a study but there are
seven articles showing an improvement in
Long covet symptoms from some
vaccination while four studies reported
no change or a worsening all right so
now let's say you're in charge of the
analysis
and you see seven articles
article doesn't mean study but seven
articles that say the vaccination helps
for that say they don't
of which one says it makes things worse
do you recommend vaccinations for long
covet
if that's what you saw
seven articles
say probably yes
for say probably now and one of them
says it might make it worse
I wouldn't call that much of a science
all right that at best at best it's like
a signal
right something you know tell you to
look into it deeper or something that's
that's all I uh that's a long way from
confirming that long covet can be helped
by vaccinations that's a long ways away
seven articles about the same study
possibly possibly seven articles about
the same study
now here's what you should have asked
about the seven studies versus the four
what if only one of them was a good
study
and that's very possible Right what if
one of them was a pretty solid study and
all the rest of them were weak
are you supposed to average them
does that make sense or do you throw
away all the weak ones and say well we
only have one good study
so let's let's emphasize this one
the most basic
basic analytical questions are sort of
just ignored
so I would put I would put zero
credibility
in any long coveted reporting
would you agree which I don't I think it
might be real this is a good chance lone
coven is real
I just think the reporting is just
garbage
all right
let's talk about Bill Gates
um
a number of you asked
uh I guess Mike cernovich has gone quite
negative on Bill Gates more so than
in the past I don't know what his past
views were but
um he seems to think that Bill Gates is
is evil in subways so I want to look
into that and see what see if there was
something new that came out and here are
some things I found
um one is that um
you've heard that Bill Gates is buying
up all the Farmland he's like the
biggest or second biggest owner of
Farmland have you heard that
and you were worried about that right
because he's going to like capture the
capture the farming industry
Bill Gates says he owns currently one
four four thousandth of the Farmland the
United States
he owns one four thousandth of it
now if that's true
are you still worried you still worried
about him
because you know he couldn't control
anything
with one four thousandth of the farmland
to me it looks like he's using it to
experiment
that's what it looks like to me it looks
like he's probably going to try you know
different water you know watering
techniques probably different seeds and
 you know just try some stuff
because that's sort of his deal his deal
right now is try and stuff see if it
works
oh somebody says to get the water rights
well if he has one for us four
thousandth of the farmland
do you think he has
more than that of the water rights
I don't know do you think some of this
Farmland has like massive water rights
and the other Farmers can't get any I
know
all right he's also said that you'll
come to like fake meat
that is not so great now but you'll come
to like it is that a problem
who has a problem with
uh fake meat probably will continue to
improve until people say you know this
is pretty good
now you're you're answering whether you
would think it would be delicious
yourself
but you don't think
but why is that a problem
all he's saying is that you'll have some
extra eating options
and that's a problem
but what is the problem yeah people are
saying it's a huge problem oh it's a
huge problem but what is that problem
okay
um
then I saw certavich say something about
uh
that the amount of money that Bill Gates
has actually given away
is roughly amount of the you know the
interest he would have earned in that
period so that his main Fortune is still
intact so that he is being disingenuous
about giving away his fortune
do you think that
do you think that Gates is not actually
giving away his money
well I'm pretty sure he's transferred
something like 20 billion
from his 100 billion
into his charity
that's a fact right it's a fact that he
moved 20 billion in now my understanding
is he's committed to giving away
um
buy or in conjunction with his death
I never heard him say I want to give it
away right away like all of it I never
heard that I always heard that he was
going to keep most of it
and you know and allocate it as there
were good uses for it
but that when he died
all of it would go to charity except
some small amount to his family
so I would say the way to judge his
promise is on his Deathbed
or after he dies I don't know you could
judge it now if he leaves it to his
family
and it was all a big scam well I would
complain about that
but I actually think he's gonna he's
gonna leave it to his his foundations
that's what I think
now
here's a guy who's spending a lot of
time trying to make better toilets for
Africa
it's hard for me to believe that his
real intention is bad
now here's uh
here's the context
um I I only do defenses of people who
aren't doing who can't defend themselves
or aren't for some reason Bill Gates
doesn't defend himself
from all the weird rumors
so I'm just sort of being a public
defender my personal opinion is I'm sure
Bill Gates has done things that would
alarm me
it's hard to know what they are
you know his personal life is
interesting now I don't know what he did
or did not do with Epstein so he's uh
you know my standard innocent until
proven guilty
innocent until proven guilty yeah yes
I'm explaining to you about the absentee
and stuff but isn't there a really long
list of people who have gone to
Epstein's Island
I'm not sure if it was a fake list I saw
but I saw a list once of all the people
who went there there are a lot of famous
people who went there a lot of them were
female
and it didn't look like all of them were
going there for the wrong reason if you
see the total list
it looks like probably most people went
there with no sexual
you know interest
it looks like most of them were just you
know taking a trip
to a rich person's Island
so I so innocent until proven guilty but
if you ask me has he done anything ever
in his life that would alarm me I would
say probably
probably I don't know what it is but
probably
so I don't I'm not defending him of all
things I'm not telling you he's an angel
not telling you he won't do anything to
you tomorrow
but at the moment it's hard
the thing I see mostly when people talk
about Bill Gates's intention
what did I see here from Robert Robert F
Kennedy Jr
he said anyone who is prepared to allow
Bill Gates to dictate world and U.S
health policy should take a long hard
look and he said that perhaps millions
of children have died unnecessarily
according to Kennedy Junior who shared
information over peer-reviewed
publication and blah blah blah blah
something about the World Health
Organization and vaccinations and a bad
outcome in Africa that gase was involved
with
um Bill Gates
and
he talks about so here's what Kennedy
says about Bill Gates
so
um
that's funny
I'm going to remove you but uh
but that was funny
so Kennedy Robert Kennedy Jr said about
Bill Gates slammed him in his quote
Messianic conviction that he is ordained
to save the world with technology
is that something Bill Gates has said
did Bill Gates ever say you know I've
got this Messianic conviction that I
need to save the world with technology
this is where
I keep wanting to back
um
Kennedy Jr Robert Kennedy Jr because I
like a lot of what he does
but when he does this
then I'm out
because the the Mind readers the people
who see intention that's just crazy
to me to me it seems crazy
now if you just stick with what he did
not what is super secret hidden
intentions are I I might be willing to
say you know those things he's doing
you know may not be as good as he wants
them to be that would be a fair
conversation
even even Gates would probably welcome
that but as soon as you say I know his
secret motivations and their evil
I'm out
I'm so out now I get that there are evil
people
you know Hitler and Stalin and stuff but
that is such a leap without evidence
if I look at what everything that Bill
Gates has done it looks like he's trying
to
um Salvage his life
to me it looks like he's trying to
salvage his life
because I think that and this is sort of
a rich guy
insight
if you're not rich
you haven't experienced this
which is the Richer you get the less
selfish you get
so a lot of the things that people
assume about Bill Gates's inner thoughts
of how he's trying to get richer and
control the world and stuff
that's very unlikely for somebody that
rich
it's far more likely that he wants to
um
not be the guy who made a bunch of money
and didn't do anything
imagine if you will that you're the like
the richest guy at one point Bill Gates
richest guy imagine if you will that
that's that's what you've done and
you're feeling real good about yourself
and then everybody in the world says
that's all you did
you just use the Monopoly to get super
rich
that's all you did
you did nothing for us you barely paid
taxes I don't know if that's true but
you know people will say that that's all
you did you just made a bunch of money
and then partied with it
that's no life
that's not a life he would enjoy now
imagine the alternative now imagine the
alternative he's the richest guy but
he puts his his work and all of his
efforts into fixing sanitation in Africa
curing malaria and polio
and doing the hardest dirtiest most
thankless stuff and if he can make that
stuff work then he may have redeemed
himself
to be you know worthy of the money that
he's made
that's how I would feel
that's how I would feel
wouldn't you
put yourself in his position
you you make you know 100 billion
dollars and you ran out of things to buy
for yourself there's nothing for you to
with that money
you don't want to leave it to your
family it will just make them crazy
so you don't think that you would try to
do good things
like legitimately good things so that
the world is better off and they'll have
a better feeling about you but more
importantly you'll feel good about
yourself
see here here's what I think people get
wrong
if you if you view a rich person by
their pre-rich personality you're going
to miss the biggest thing
people who are not yet Rich will do a
lot of sketchy things to get rich
once you are rich and you're going to
stay that way
you're you're everything that you want
in life changes
you'd like people to think you you know
are helping you'd like people who think
you added something right now that's
very much how I feel that's that's my
arc I doubt it feels different for him
but he does a bad job of not looking
like a monster
I don't think he's completely
seeing the whole field in terms of how
he looks when he does his thing because
he he talks like a robot he just
describes things cold
I don't know what he would say about the
vaccination program that apparently had
bad incomes in Africa he's getting
blamed for pushing some of that I don't
know his involvement but I'm if I had to
guess
if I had to guess he'd probably say
something like
you know every new advancement kills
people
that's what Elon Musk says roughly Elon
Musk says yeah we're going to get to
Mars but people will die
well now that's transparent if if Bill
Gates had said the same thing you might
feel different
suppose he said you know
I think the vaccinations of of all types
not just covered but all types I think
they're more good than bad but the fact
is they do kill a lot of people
they do kill a lot of people and when we
do human trials
the only reason we do human trials is to
find out if it kills people and
sometimes it does
and you know don't want to minimize that
don't want to minimize that that's a big
deal you're killing people who didn't
need to die but there's a reason we do
see how they're great or good or
something so I think you could explain
it but he's doing it he's not doing much
of a job though
all right
um
and then some people think there's
philanthropy is a is a clever way to
funnel money in his Direction
so really it's all about you know
getting more power and stuff
um
I doubt it I doubt it but uh here's
something I learned in the process so
you know Terra power which is a new Gen
4
nuclear power plant and Terra power was
ready to spin up their first working
Generation 4 nuclear power plant that's
a big deal
that's like a really big deal but it's
on hold
because they had to work with Russia to
get the whatever the nuclear materials
are and of course the war with Russia
and the Ukraine makes that impossible so
Terra power one of the one of the things
they could have saved to civilization
is on hold
because the Ukraine war
nobody's ever mentioned that
who has ever mentioned that
I feel like that's a big deal
you know because climate change
is no matter what you think about the
reality of it is one of our biggest
topics and one of the most expensive
things and if there was something that
was happening that was really going to
be one of the super important platforms
to get us out of the problem if there is
one
and suddenly it's on hold indefinitely
and there's got to be
yeah there's got to be a better way to
do that
all right
uh
uh and I will allow you to have whatever
opinions you want to Bill Gates I just
want to give you
one one alternative View
then you can make up your own minds
it was interesting that when I watch
um Sam Harris and Bill Gates
and me
by far we get in the most trouble when
we're trying to do something useful
right if I'm just around nobody
cares
so I'm just mocking people or whatever
nobody cares it's just jokes but as soon
as I try to be useful
you know like you know help you through
decision making and stuff uh that all of
a sudden
you know I'm saying
all right
um
do you remember my prediction about
George Soros
I'll remind you
the only way I can understand George
Soros
is that he doesn't know exactly what
he's doing
that
there may be entities that are asking
for money and they're going through a
third party and the third party who
helps make the specific decisions uh
they're lying to the people they give
them the money to maybe even taking
Kickbacks and they're probably lying to
Soros so I don't think Soros is on the
ball enough to know what the people who
are Downstream from him are actually
doing
I think they're telling him oh we we
gave some money to this great
organization it's called black lives
matter and they're going to end
discrimination in the United States and
then Soros goes all right here's the
money
tell me how it's going
and six months later after they've been
like riots and and everything's bad
they'll come back and say it looks like
it's working
I think we've really made a dent in the
public Consciousness the conversation is
you know on the things we want it's
working so we need some more money to
keep it working and Soros says that
sounds good here's some more money
that's what I think it's happening I
think that a Soros is no longer fully
competent and the people that spend his
money or allocate his money now control
him
they control him by lying about what
they're doing so that they can get a
better cut of his money
so I think he's surrounded by grifters
and con artists
and that the real story is that he's a
victim
even though he's the cause of you know
most of the energy and the action he's
the cause so he's the original cause but
I think it's coming back and and eating
him alive I think that you tried to do
something that he thought was good
that you don't
and he dealt with too many evil people
and they just they're just robbing him
at this point I think he's just getting
robbed
he backed down to the Davos meeting that
could be because of health so he's at an
age where you have to assume that
there's other stuff going on
Soros has lost the public perception
game yeah he's definitely lost that
Robert says I'd stick up for every rich
guy in public too do I stand up for
every rich guy
do you remember me uh defending Epstein
that didn't happen
how about O.J was I on team OJ
about Weinstein was I pro-weinstein
because he was pretty rich
I'm so not
pro-rich people like nothing like that
it's crazy
all right
um
yeah I never got it I never got an
invitation to the island so
therefore he must die well I guess he
did maybe
yeah if I did it from O.J
all right
uh
Wes video how can we make a world
government you know I one of the
problems that the wef has is that they
allow
diverse voices
to form opinions and you know it gets I
guess published under the wef
Banner there so I feel like they they
promote a lot of opinions that are not
necessarily some kind of a group opinion
so I think that's part of it you're just
seeing some diverse opinions
well allow yeah it's probably it's an
organization they have to allow
you're not worth considering the same
conversation as those guys
all right
um
all right Epstein Island was overrated
according to you
all right all right that's all for now
YouTube I'll talk to you later best live
stream you've ever seen bye for now
