hey and if you'd like to make
2021 an unbroken string of incredible
mornings
i can't speak for your afternoon but
your mornings
i'm in control and they're gonna go well
so it looks like yet another day in 2021
where the morning is
incredible good morning omar
and let me uh make it even better
with one little tweak just one little
thing that you need to make this special
i think you know what it is it's a
copper mug or glass a tanker chelsea
sign a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
[Applause]
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
yeah the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous it happens
now go
excuse me while i savor it savor it
favorite all right um
the most mysterious story in the news
mysterious is that president trump
uh skipped out on his own new year's eve
celebration at mar-a-lago
a lot of a lot of people paid a thousand
dollars to take it to attend
but the president uh was not there so
the thinking is the speculation uh oh
we'll get to the whiteboard
i'm gonna make you wait for that it's
gonna be worth it but the speculation is
that there might be something
brewing with iran in terms of a
an attack and it's because it's the uh
it's the anniversary one-year
anniversary of solomony
and apparently iranian officials are
just saying directly
that there will be revenge and it will
be pretty big
and i ask you this number one
would iran be able to even with our
you know ambiguous presidential
transition situation going on the worst
worst possible situation
do you think iran would find it in their
interest
to do some kind of an attack where it
was obvious it was them
it actually killed americans do you
think they could do that right now
i would like to send a message
to the iranian uh the iranian
elite and it goes like this
um dear iranian elite
before you make the decision to attack
the united states
something you need to know and i don't
know if there's a cultural difference so
maybe it's not obvious to you
or something like that but let me
explain it in the clearest
possible terms
if you kick us when we're down
it's not going to be pretty
let me tell you if if
this would be maybe the
worst time in the history of human
civilization
to attack the united states
because if you heard of this president
we still have for a few more days
president trump
rumor has it he's not in a good mood
lately
something about the election not going
his way
you don't want to do the attack while
he's still got his finger
on the you know on the military
so here's my prediction i don't think
there's
any chance iranians are so dumb that
they would attack
a lame-duck president trump there
wouldn't be
anything more dangerous than that now
waiting for biden to take office
[Music]
but then why would you attack right
because biden would have been opposed to
the attack
if biden had been in charge he would
have said no don't kill solomon a
so why would iran want to do an attack
while biden is still if biden is in
office
wouldn't that be the time that they
would want to not attack
because that's where they would think
maybe we could work out a a deal
and still get our nukes and still get
everything we want right
so it seems to me that if iran has some
need to attack
for i don't know national pride or
whatever the reason is
that don't they have to do it while
trump is still in office
right because first of all it lines up
with the anniversary and
second of all it was trump who made the
decision why would they attack biden who
will be
closer to something like on their side
it wouldn't make any sense strategically
right attacking biden would turn biden
into trump
and what they want is less trump
so what the heck is iran going to do
now the the talk the chatter is it might
have be drone attacks in iraq
against american forces or quad cap
quadcopter
attacks so we're seeing now the
beginning of the era of the small
drone a quadcopter is like those four
propeller little drones that you could
pick up with your
you know sort of a consumer-sized drone
but bigger a little bit
bigger and if those things are the new
attack vector uh
it's a whole new world yeah it could be
a drone war but the problem with any
kind of drone attacks is that we would
know where they came from
wouldn't we i mean even if you didn't
know where they came from
you'd still know where they came from so
i
i think the iranians don't have any
options
don't you i feel like there's no options
for
them to do anything but they may have
just wanted to ruin everybody's holiday
the president's holiday by threatening
so my live stream yesterday in which
my title was that i said it looks like
trump won based on the news out of
georgia
with the forensic expert who looked at
the hackability of the system
and it's pushing a quarter million views
today
what exactly happened what why would
that video get a quarter million views
is it because there was nothing else
going on most of the other content
yesterday was a repeat
or something because it was a uh
holiday-ish
i don't know why that got a quarter
million views and it's still screaming
maybe it's just because it said trump
won and the title
um so here's the the most
let's say obvious and grotesque
media manipulation that i've seen in a
while now
if you've been watching this for a while
this periscopes or my live streams for a
while you know
that i talk about the technique that the
media uses to
brainwash the public and i use brainwash
not in any exaggerated way i mean actual
literal brainwashing
and i would call propaganda brainwashing
you know i would use those
interchangeably
but propaganda usually means in a
political sense so let's say propaganda
and here's an example that if you did
not
know the techniques of persuasion you
wouldn't even notice this
but you do know the techniques of
persuasion so let me read this
this uh this bit from the new york times
and then you tell me what manipulation
that they put into it
it says uh here's a exact sentence from
the new york times
trump continues his assault on election
integrity
baselessly claiming the presidential
results and now the senate runoffs in
georgia were both invalid
and it said that no courts have ruled on
uh
have ruled that there's any fraud now
what is the yeah thinking beyond the
sale thank you
right whenever you see a major media
entity
make you think past the sale that's just
propaganda
now they can disguise their news as
opinion
but it's in the new york times and if
you're reading the new york times
and something they decided was good
enough to publish even as an opinion
says that trump is making an assault on
election integrity
what do you have to assume to understand
this sentence
well you would have to assume that
whatever he's doing is illegitimate
and that the election was perfectly good
that's not in evidence i i will agree
that it has not been proven that the
election uh was
tainted to the point where it changed
the the result
of course that has not been proven of
course
but there is massive
circumstantial evidence that has not
been fully
you know fully debunked and or even
analyzed by any kind of court
now most of you know that but at least
half of the public believes that
courts have looked at the evidence 50
times
and re or 60 times and rejected them all
so i just tweeted this morning an actual
consumer of news
in the united states believes that this
is a true statement
that 59 and the 60 courts
or court cases were thrown out because
the evidence of fraud
was non-existent
nothing like that's ever happened in
this country didn't happen this year
last year never happened it's just a
completely imaginary
story which now has become truth
it is completely imaginary that courts
have looked at the evidence
nobody has now courts have looked at
the case and decided that they couldn't
couldn't rule on it for a variety of
tactical reasons but no court has looked
at the evidence
right so let me give you an idea how
the news or even an opinion within a
news
vehicle would look if they were trying
to be
honest if they were even trying to be
honest
what would the same kind of story look
like here's how here's what it would
look like
instead instead of saying trump
continues his assault on election
integrity
you might say something more objective
such as
trump continues to push every legal
means
to challenge a result that evidence
he believes looks solid says that it was
fraudulent
but courts have not looked at any
evidence and so there's no ruling
one way or the other about whether the
election was
fraudulent now did i say anything that
was
that was inaccurate did you hear any
inaccuracies in what i said
trump is using his legal challenges true
trump believes the election was
fraudulent true
he bases his opinion on a massive amount
of circumstantial
evidence true
no no court has ruled on the evidence
true isn't that good context
don't you think that that context sort
of important to the story
and if you see that kind of context left
out
but instead they do a making you think
past the sale
that's just brainwashing now if you did
not recognize this
thinking pass the sale technique you
would read this as news
and so all of those consumers who are
not as well armed as
my viewers who know this technique if
you don't see it so clearly
and say oh that's one of those
techniques that's a brainwashing
technique
making you think best of sale if you
didn't recognize it
you wouldn't know you would just think
you saw the news
think about that at least 95 of all
consumers would not recognize
this big glaring signal that this is not
real news
they wouldn't see it because you're sort
of used to people talking this way
you don't understand it as technique
here's another thing that they could
have added for context
tell me if any of this is untrue i'll
call it the
the adam's rule of uh fraud that
whenever there's a situation where
fraud can happen and there's a very high
upside and lots of people are involved
so you know that somebody's going to
take that chance
even if some of them are honest under
those conditions
fraud happens every time did i just say
anything that you find
even provocative much less untrue
is it even controversial can you find
anything wrong with that statement that
if it's possible
and there's a high payoff and lots of
people involved so you know that some of
them will be criminals
that fraud happens basically every time
how is that not a fair statement now
isn't that pretty valuable context
because they're treating the election as
if it's a thing which is usually
or should be assumed by its nature
is probably fair nothing like that is
true
it is observably obviously true
that it is almost certainly fraudulent
this election and all of our other ones
now i'm not saying that no republican
ever won because of fraud in an election
i assume it's happened i just
think that the the smarter fairer
more rational context would be of course
there was
major fraud in the election of course it
was there had to be
and and if i had to guess that wherever
republicans could get a little advantage
almost certainly there was republican
fraud
if you think i'm the one who's going to
say just the democrats do fraud
nope nope there's no part of me that
thinks
democrats are the only ones who do
election fraud
but it is nonetheless true that in those
swing states and in the big cities and
the swing states
they're under democrat control and so
the democrats have more options for
fraud
and so it wouldn't matter if republicans
and democrats were equally
willing to do fraud it would only matter
that the democrats were willing
because they have the levers that the
republicans didn't have
now you could argue if you wanted to be
consistent you say well scott
you know trump won florida and maybe
there was some republican fraud
i don't know i don't know if you told me
there was republican fraud that gave
trump
florida i wouldn't push back on that i'd
say i don't know
but it's certainly within the category
of things that you would expect to
happen
the only reason i wouldn't expect fraud
in florida
is if the republicans were confident
they were going to win the regular way
and then maybe not but wherever you can
have it
it's going to be wherever there can be
now i think that would be perfectly good
context
to say there hasn't been proven that
there's fraud
but we are talking about a situation
where it's guaranteed
let me give you another example uh i
have no statistics
of crime in new york city let's just say
i for whatever reason i don't have
statistics for that could i still know
that there was crime in new york city
pretty reliably right because it's a
city
and it's full of lots of people and
within that big complicated city
you know there are going to be people
who want to do crime have a high upside
and the capability of doing it you don't
need to see it
to know what's happening same with the
election
you don't need to see the fraud it can't
not
happen it's the setup that makes it
happen
all right so that's the new york times
and that is pure
uh brainwashing and manipulation that's
the world you live in
they're not even trying to be news and
let me say that again this
isn't even trying to be news if you
think this is some kind of an
accident where this was just not a good
job somebody wasn't a good writer
no no nothing like that's happening this
is just brainwashing
there's another piece of brainwashing
going on
and i'm uh i'm at least partly the
subject of it
meaning that people like me simply
talking about the topic
and let me say this as clearly as
possible i am personally
not aware of any proof
of election fraud period
personally i'm not aware of any proof
i'm aware of lots of allegations
some look credible some look less
credible but i'm not personally aware of
any fraud how could i be
i mean unless i saw it myself i probably
wouldn't believe it if it were reported
so i'm speaking completely objectively
about
what we all see and in fact i don't
think i'm adding anything
that we don't all see so even when i
retweet something that's some claim i
don't retweet it like it's a fact
if you've seen my tweets lately i say is
this true
or has it been debunked so am i allowed
ask yourself am i allowed to speak this
subjectively on just the topic
i'm not telling you you know i'm not
adding information that's not
obvious to everybody can i talk about it
well i've had people come at me on
social media lately
and say that i'm the election denier
and that now i'm the i'm the brand
of crazy people who think the election
was
uh was faked do you notice
do you notice uh what's happening by
making me
uh a character of ridicule
they wanna they wanna hold me up as
somebody they're ridiculing
so that you don't do it let me ask you
this
if you saw me getting savaged in social
media
because somebody else claims that i'm
saying the election was
was stolen uh are you as likely to
go public no the whole point of it is
it's suppressing fire
so they'll go after somebody like me and
i'm not even i'm not even one of the
crazy people with crazy claims
i'm pretty sure i haven't made any crazy
claims like zero
but if they can paint me as one of the
crazy ones
then it will discourage you from even
talking about it in public
because what what they need to do is set
up a situation where if you even brought
up the topic
even at work you'd be at work and you
brought up the topic
you want the other people at the table
to just go
whoa i guess you're one of those
deniers what's next holocaust denial
see so that's so it's suppressive work
now there's something they didn't count
on
me they didn't count on the fact that i
have no shame and no sense of
embarrassment and i'm largely immune to
this sort of thing
so all it does is make me want to talk
about it more so today i wasn't going to
talk about it
but because because people told me that
i'm a bad person for talking about it oh
now i'm going to talk about it
that's just red meat as soon as you tell
me i can't talk about it i don't want to
talk about anything else
so you might hear a lot of it all right
uh
do you know uh george conway
i'll bet you have i bet you do george
conway uh he's uh
you know kellyanne conway of course
had been a top advisor to the president
helped him get elected the first time
and her husband george conway uh who i
call the lesser
conway um he's like the conway that
you know if you were going to do a
startup have you ever heard of an
mvp version sometimes
when you do a startup you do something
called an mvp
version or a minimum viable product so
you slap
together the some software or a product
just to see if somebody would use it but
it's really poorly done it's just
slapped together
i feel like when god was making conways
he's like oh let's
let's try to make a conway and he made
george and he's like
i feel like version 1.0 needs a little
upgrade and then
then he did kellyanne and and their and
their child
and they got it right eventually but
anyway um i asked this question
which george conway responded to which
is why i'm mentioning him
i said question for experts
hypothetically now hypothetically is
important to what i'm going to say next
hypothetically all right i said
hypothetically what would happen
if biden is inaugurated and a month
later it's proven
and i put this in capitals beyond any
reasonable doubt
so just hypothetically what would happen
biden takes office gets inaugurated is
his administration gets down to work
and then later some some evidence is
beyond dispute let's say
an eyewitness plus computer logs
whatever
just something that nobody would doubt
just literally
no democrat would doubt that the
election was stolen
now i don't think that can happen that's
why i'm saying hypothetically
is very unlikely but you know in the
wildest possibility it could happen
anything's possible here's what george
conway said to that
he mocked me i remember how the mocking
is important right
the mocking is suppressive fire do you
think george conway had any real reason
to tweet at me
why would he what would be the
motivation suppressing fire
it has nothing to do with whether my
point is good or bad
it has everything to do with whether i
should be able to talk
or should i be mocked from my opinion so
in order to mock me
he rewords my hypothetical question to
show how ridiculous it is
and remember he's a professional lawyer
and professional lawyers
can they can debate really well so
you're going to see
a top lawyer at the top of his form
debating in public and making me look
silly
with this great great mocking point that
he makes he rewrites my tweet to say
hypothetically i'll do it in a mocking
voice so you can get the whole
feel of it hypothetically what would
happen if biden is inaugurated
and a month later it's proven beyond any
reasonable doubt
that martians have the real constitution
and says trump is president for life
unlikely scenario sure
but who would be president then says
george conway
now i've got a book for george it's
behind my head
it's called loser think in my book loser
think
i have a large section talking about how
only idiots use analogies as arguments
now his argument
that um that martians having a
constitution
would be a similar likelihood to uh
fraud being proven in the election now
let me put this in context the odds that
elect
that there there was massive election
fraud is close to a hundred percent
again it's because of the setup of the
situation guarantees it
not because of any specific evidence
that i'm looking at
just the setup guarantees it so you have
a situation that
guarantees something will happen and
he's comparing that an analogy to
something
that could never happen so his argument
is an analogy of something that could
never happen
to something that pretty much is
guaranteed did happen
we just don't know if we'll ever know
right so it's the
the part where you don't know if you'll
ever know that's you know the
uncertainty not whether it happened
and now let me ask you this do you think
that that was a good
uh lawyer point he's got the logic and
the data on his side
using a rational argument no
no this point because
let me let me give george conway a
compliment
if i might all right because it's
important to the story
uh he is a professional
high-end lawyer i don't think
kellyanne conway married a dummy do you
this is a smart guy smart guy who knows
the law and therefore
knows how to debate things do you think
when he chose
the strategy of mocking me as a person
do you think he chose the strategy of
mocking me
while he had a different strategy a
go-to strategy
of showing me data and an argument that
was more solid than mine
do you think if he had an argument that
was better than mine
or a let's say a point with data etc
do you believe that he would have used
the good argument
if he had one of course
no nobody uses the bad argument if they
have a good one
if he had any kind of a pushback that
would make sense and would be persuasive
he would use it
but instead he goes for the mocking
analogy which tells you their strategy
is to go after the person
which he did now here's the other tell
for a fake news industry that's
manipulating you
if you see the the media going after the
people
instead of the argument
that's all you need that's all you need
to know if they're going after the
people instead of the argument
you are in a massive brainwashing
scenario which you are
um let's see what else we got here
so the uh louis representative louis
gomer
gohmert i don't know how to pronounce
his name of texas he had this
suit where he wanted uh pence to be able
to throw out the electoral
uh whatever but that got tossed down at
court so we don't have to worry about
that
so on social media on twitter
a user said that uh he doesn't know
anybody who smokes weed who adds to
society
so somebody said that in public i don't
know anybody who smokes weed
who adds to you know adds to society
so i tweeted back
for context it would be important to
know how many people do you know
because if you only know three people
okay
i i could certainly believe if you only
know three people
you probably don't know anybody who
smokes weed and or you might not
know anybody who smokes weed and is also
successful
i have a feeling just speculation
that somebody who has an opinion like
this
maybe their friends lie to them
just put it out there maybe just maybe
this is a person who has possibly
several friends who smoke weed and are
very productive
but maybe they don't share that fact
with mr judgey
mr judgmental maybe they don't share
that
but this sparked me to make a
larger statement about drugs
do not smoke marijuana can i say that as
clearly as possible can we can we start
with that
don't smoke marijuana you know don't be
like me
don't do drugs now having said that
children did you all hear that children
don't do drugs children
now that's that's the child message
can you put the children away if there
are any children listening
quite seriously this part i'm not
kidding
no joke here don't let the kids hear
this next part
this is for adults and i think you you
adults would all
understand that there are things adults
will and will not say in public
because kids will hear it right there
are things you would
say to other adults but you might not
say it in public
because your kids will hear it and this
is going to be that conversation
it goes like this i
have access to because of my dilbert
career
access to an unusual number of highly
successful people and have
for years because people are successful
like to talk to other people who have
done something so it's very natural you
end up
meeting a whole bunch of billionaires
so for whatever reason i probably have
met
and had you know meaningful
conversations with more billionaires
than most people
and hugely successful entrepreneurs etc
and i'll tell you there is one
correlation
that looks pretty strong which is drug
use
but a really really big difference
between successful people who use any
kind of
drug and unsuccessful people who use any
kind of drug and maybe become addicted
and their life is ruined
and here's the difference you don't know
which one of those people you are
unfortunately you might say to yourself
you know
let's say you're 19 pick an age you say
to yourself i think i'm the kind of
person
who can do some drugs and i think he'll
just help me might relax me expand my
mind
whatever i think i i think i am that
kind of person who can do a bunch of
drugs and
i'll be fine turns out
you didn't know you're an addict meaning
that
biologically you're more likely to be
addicted to substances
and the same thing that might not have
killed someone else
ends your life and i don't mean you just
die i mean you become
addicted and then the addiction becomes
your life so your old life is over
you have this new thing you could call
it a life but
it's the addiction becomes your
personality at that point
the old you is dead it's still alive but
dead in a sense
so here's the thing you just have to
know
it is not true that drugs are bad
it is not true that drugs are good
it's very not true that drugs are good
here's what's true
if you could match the right drug
with the right person and the right
situation you get magic
sorry children now
the trick is you don't know if you're
that person
and chances are you're not if you're
going to play the odds
you're not that person right but
sometimes there is that person
i'm going to throw out some names and
these are not
i'm not going to i don't want to
incriminate anybody i'll just put out
some names that maybe would be obvious
to you
but let's take a steve jobs who
famously you know did some lsd and
probably marijuana and some other stuff
take your bill gates young bill gates
i think he he admits some marijuana
usage
i believe that's part of the public
record if it's not i take it back
so i don't want to i don't want to cast
aspersions on people
now why did i pick steve jobs because
he's deceased
right so i can talk about him because
he's deceased
i want to mention some other
billionaires
i want to but i'm not right because
they're still alive
wouldn't be fair i can tell you that
among the most successful people
one of the defining characteristics
doesn't look like a correlation it does
look like
causation but without a you know
randomized controlled trial
you don't really know for sure but it
sure looks like causation
and certainly personal experience would
suggest it is
and that is that a very smart person who
is lucky enough and it has to be locked
to not have the addiction genes if you
will that person can
on some occasions find the right
combination of legal or illegal drugs to
boost
their performance a lot
in fact i would go so far as to say the
success of silicon valley is largely
based on drugs
and it's largely based on drugs in the
sense that those few people who found
the right drugs
that just got lucky they weren't addicts
and in some cases they probably were
actually and still
still did good things despite their
lives
being suboptimal so here's the point
um there's no such thing as drugs being
good or bad you just have to be lucky
enough
that the mixture of the drug the person
and the situation
are right people who do and
again this is the adult conversation
right nothing i say today
should suggest to you to do drugs i'm
telling you as clearly as possible
that if you just wander into and say i
think i'll try some drugs
your odds are bad they're bad
because there are so many people who are
addicts it's just a bad bet
it is nonetheless true that people do it
right it's a free country
people people analyze their risks they
take chances maybe i think they
shouldn't
but they do we live in the real world
they do some of them are going to work
now one of my lucky coincidences
is that my chosen drug marijuana finally
is legal
so at least i don't have to break the
law but i can tell you in my personal
situation
again this is a a coincidental
uh perfect situation where the exact
drug the exact person and the situation
were perfect i i'm a creative person by
nature
marijuana makes me more creative and
it's not even close
if you're saying to yourself i think you
just imagine you're being creative
nope it's pretty easy to demonstrate
i mean i can't demonstrate it to you but
i can tell you over the course of my
career
you know i've got a white board next to
where
my bong is and i can tell you that the
white board gets filled
with ideas that do become part of my
content they do make money
the next day they're just as good you
know it's not like i wake up the next
day i go
what the hell was i thinking last night
it doesn't work that way
i look at the board and i go shoot i
never would have thought of that
if i hadn't been high and it's like my
best ideas
my best jokes my best books my best
concepts
my most best weird ideas pretty much all
of them come out of marijuana
now that's not why i smoke
is this just luck the the reason i do is
for health reasons i don't do it
recreationally
i do it completely as a medicinal it
solves like
a whole list of problems everything from
it makes me sleep better good for my
allergies
you know fixes my attitude so those are
the reasons i'm doing it
i can exercise better i mean just
everything works better with with
marijuana for me
don't do marijuana right i got lucky
pure luck pure luck
that that drug and my personality and my
job
which is creativity just happened to
match perfectly
the odds of you finding that combination
don't even look for it because
your chances of ruining your life
looking for it are pretty high
i'm just saying it happens some of us
get lucky
now is it really luck
is it really well let me tell you some
things
i'll give you my experience and that
might give you a little insight
in college i did try some form of speed
now it was i think it was ritalin you
know some illegal
ritalin or something i had and some
other illegal
stimulant i wrote my entire senior
thesis
in i think four days over
a thanksgiving break i wrote my entire
senior thesis in economics in four days
you are allocated an entire term
right so you've got the whole term to
write this thing
i did it in four days because i wanted
to didn't want to go home right away
that's it and i did that on one pill
now i got like a b-plus i think it was
fine
and do i recommend that you take
a stimulant no
no i do not do you know how easily
that one experience could have ruined my
life
oh i take it back it was more than one
experience well i did have
several experiences with um i think it
was ritalin
at the time and that was a stimulant
and when i did that i could do all my
homework
i could smoke weed as much as i wanted
and it would sort of cancel each other
out
and i could exercise all day long
and when i was done the outcome was
a lot of good work a lot of exercise
and that's it and i walked away as like
okay i just
won and i didn't give up anything
so now you say to yourself hey i guess
i'll go do those drugs because it worked
out for scott
no no don't do that
do you know how lucky i was to have that
experience
and not become addicted probably the
only thing that kept me from being
addicted was supply
because it wasn't it wasn't easy to get
those stimulants in those days
at the moment it's easy i believe it's
easy at the moment
i don't try to get them so i don't know
but i feel as if the only thing that
kept me alive
was a lack of supply because the
experience was so good
that i feel like especially at that age
where you know your brain isn't quite
developed you don't have
you don't have the experience or the
ability to avoid things that are
tempting
i feel as if it might have killed me you
know i could have been a meth addict
could have taken it up the chain to
something worse
um so i would say
that everything about my experience is
really
luck plus the fact that i don't seem to
have a
an addictive personality i don't like
alcohol i just don't ex i don't like the
experience of alcohol
and i did i did uh
mushrooms once only one hallucinogen
changed my whole life i've told this
story many times
once you've done a hallucinogen you can
see that life is subjective
and once you understand that your
experience of life is subjective
even if there's an underlying objective
truth
that once you realize that it changes
the whole way you
you live because you say well if i don't
like my subjective reality
can i change it and the answer is yup
you can yeah it takes technique but you
can completely change how you frame your
reality and
and loosen the gins prove that to you
in a way that just thinking and
researching and reading and
experimenting
will never prove it to you but you want
proof
spend a few hours on mushrooms again
don't
do drugs i'm not saying you should do
that
i'm very i'm aggressively telling you
not to do it
but if you did and you're an adult
you would have an experience if you
didn't die you know if you didn't get a
bad
batch of mushrooms or something so
there's some risk involved
but if you did it it would change
forever your
um and here's here's why it's important
it's not just this
weird new knowledge this reality is
subjective
it's understanding that you can change
that subjective reality to
optimize your life gigantically
this is not trivial stuff i'm talking
about
uh something that will make your life
five to ten times better
you know we're not talking about a 20
improvement because you did
mushrooms once i'm talking about like a
500
improvement over the course of your life
simply by
understanding that you can shape your
reality to have a subjective experience
that's different than the one that's the
default so
that's what that will do to you
now there are other drugs i've never
done such as
molly or uh what's the other name for
molly
ecstasy so i've never done that
because i hear that they're too good
there are some drugs that i won't take
because they're too good heroin
cocaine and uh yeah
and mdma so there's some things that
that's the reason i don't take them
they're too good
and i know that if i let myself get into
that stuff
i i don't know if i'm strong enough not
to do heroin twice
do you i'd like to think i'm strong
enough
that if i you know took some heroin and
i really liked it i'd be like you know
i did that once i guess i don't need
that
i'd love to know that's me but you don't
know that about yourself
if there's anything that experience
teaches you better than anything
the best thing that experience teaches
you is you don't know
yourself once you realize
that you think you know yourself but
even you don't know yourself
then then you're a little safer because
you'll treat yourself like an unknown
and then you'll do better risk
management because you'll say i don't
know
feels like it feels like i wouldn't get
hooked on heroin
but i don't know so i'd better stay away
so that's my point i personally don't
know
i'm not going to say i don't know
anybody but i personally don't know
anybody who is hugely successful
i'll say almost anybody who's hugely
successful who did not get there
with drugs as an assistant
sorry that's why that's why the children
had to leave the room
in the real world this is well known by
the way among these successful people
who also know other successful people
this is common knowledge
what i'm telling you there are some
people through luck
but also some skill the luck is that
they're not addicts by nature
the skill is that they then put a little
thinking on what to do and what not to
do
and some of them craft their drug use
specifically for productivity
so when somebody says i don't know
anybody who smokes weed and has been
successful
that may be you know you may have some
friends that fit that category make
sense
but also most people are not terribly
successful
if i said to you i don't know anybody
who's uh
okay i'll say this i don't know any
redheads
that are really successful
and i'm thinking if i could think of an
exception and the answer is
i'm sure i probably know some redheads
that are super successful i mean i know
lots of redheads who have good jobs
but i don't know any redhead like steve
jobs
i don't i don't know our redheaded
billionaire right
but you know solid jobs and good
citizens and stuff
and so should i conclude that nobody
with red hair could ever be really
really successful no
this is bad statistics because most
people do not become billionaires most
people do not become steve jobs
so it wouldn't matter what category you
picked people with big noses
people who whatever you would find that
most of them are not
successful so would you say well i think
that red hair
must be correlated with a lack of
success because the people i know
personally with red hair are not
billionaires okay that's just bad
thinking about statistics right
all right way more than you wanted um
i saw something on cnn about how to make
your habits
uh last and so i'll recommend you to cnn
but i'm not going to use exactly their
list i'm going to modify it a little bit
and it goes like this so here are some
ways to lock in
habits one way and so inspired by cnn so
go to cnn.com if you want to see their
take on it
um one way is to put the new habit
uh associated with an existing habit
so the way that the that uh one a day
vitamins were marketed is as one a day
and the one a day told you oh i'll do it
when i brush my teeth
because i'm doing that other stuff that
gets you ready for the morning
so if you if you pair your one a day
vitamin
and the reason it's one a day is just
for marketing there's no reason that
vitamins should be one a day
versus you know smaller doses throughout
the day or any other dose
it's purely marketing and not science
that is once a day
that's that's well understood by the way
i'm not making that up
but by pairing it with something you're
definitely going to do every day which
is
brush your teeth you pretty much
guarantee that you're going to take your
one a day vitamin
but there are other ways to do it you
can pair other habits
for example the the cnn example was
um well actually this is a second
example you can pair something
pleasurable
with um the thing that you want to make
a habit
so their example was to make it a habit
to read to listen to an audio book
while you exercise so you're pairing a a
thing you enjoy
anyway with the thing you want to make
your habit and so you pair them
good technique so that's slightly
different than
just pairing habits where one habit
exists this would be a second thing
um another one is to get a partner who's
in on it with you
to keep you on track let's say you're
both trying to lose weight you're both
trying to walk every day whatever it is
if you've got one other person who's
going to keep you honest
that can help all right because maybe
they can talk you into walking the day
you don't you can talk them into it etc
here's another one create an incentive
reward or penalty each
for each time you do or don't do the
habit now i've talked about this with
i love to be tired after working out
and have a nice protein shake that's you
know delicious
while looking at what happened on
twitter on my phone
that little moment where you've worked
out and you're just enjoying your
your beverage and the protein feels like
it's helping you
and you're just you know thinking
whatever you want to think
is my reward so i would always pair i
would put that after exercise
but there's another way to do it which
is to penalize yourself
to penalize yourself so the cnn example
was
that you'd have like a your spouse would
donate to
a small amount of money to a charity
that you don't like
every time you didn't do your habit so
it'd be like a little
penalty but not really a penalty for not
doing anything here's how i did this
with myself i could never remember
to put on my sunscreen at least on my
face the exposed parts
before i went out for the day if it's
just a regular day
i would always remember my sunscreen if
i were going swimming or i'm going to be
outside all day but i couldn't get the
habit
of putting on sunscreen just every day
you know in california especially
and so here's what i lit on i decided to
punish myself
every time i forgot and the punishment
would be i'd be sitting in my car
and i'm ready to go wherever it is i
want to go and if i realized then that i
didn't have my sunscreen
on i would have to get out of the car
put everything down like i'd never been
in the car
take off my jacket walk upstairs put on
the sunscreen
and then redo it now do you know how
annoying that is
if you're like in the car and you're
ready to start it
and you want to go somewhere you hate
that
you hate that you've got to redo
everything
and just start again and so that was my
punishment
do you know how many times i had to do
that to myself
i don't know the exact number but if i
had to guess
over the summer and let's say since last
six months i've been trying it
probably 40 times
think about that 40 times
i'm ready to go and i'd put it all down
and walked upstairs
as a result of punishing myself
regularly for six months
i uh i'm much closer to remembering it
every time now i'm not there yet
but that's my technique all right so
that's how to do that here's a here's a
little question
that is also for the adults in this case
i don't mean just the adults by age but
people who can understand nuanced points
what i'm about to talk about i should
not talk about because i'm not a
doctor i'm no scientist
damn it i shouldn't be talking about
stuff like this
but there is an interesting category in
the world which is one of my
favorite categories and it is this
things which cannot be
communicated for different reasons
for example here's a thing that could
not be communicated let's say you are
known as the biggest
liar in your town you just had a
reputation for making up stories that
were crazy
and then one day you're actually
abducted by actual aliens
like in real life it's the only time
it's ever happened
hypothetically and and you're abducted
by actual aliens
could you communicate to anybody else
after that
that it really happened the answer is no
because your reputation as the most
famous liar
would make it literally impossible for
you to communicate a true thing
that you were abducted by aliens
couldn't be done right
and there are a whole bunch of other
weird situations in which
uh you can't communicate like i could be
right in front of you
and it can't happen it's just impossible
i'll give you another example one of
those
there's all kinds of weird examples of
this one is uh
there was something that happened to me
a long time ago
and i once tried to tell somebody about
it that i'd never told anybody about it
and it would be the first time anybody
ever heard this
traumatic story and i actually
had this weird experience where my mouth
wouldn't
do it i had made the decision
to say it like the mind was all on board
there was no
there was no ambiguity in my brain and
my brain ordered my mouth to talk
and it wouldn't do it i've never had
that experience before
and it just wouldn't do it i mean it
literally wouldn't do it
and it was because it was so traumatic
that my brain just said nope this is not
gonna ever come out of your mouth
and it never has never never in its
fullness i've
suggested it before but never in his
fullness
and i don't know if i ever could
actually i think my mouth actually
wouldn't work
now you know i don't want to get into
some sad example
because i'm well over it so you don't
have to worry about me but
there are these categories here's
another one what i'm going to talk to
you about now
should only be talked about by experts
and doctors but they can't
they can't and here's the reason because
it would be unethical
for them to tell you what i'm going to
tell you now i can do it
because i'm not a doctor and i will
trust you to be adults
and to understand that if someone who is
a professional cartoonist
says something that you believe has a
medical implication
and then you follow that advice well
that's your own damn fault
because let me tell you you should not
be getting medical advice from
cartoonists
now if i told you something that you
know
you you thought was interesting and you
asked your doctor that's different
but make sure it's a doctor that gives
you medical advice okay
don't take it from me so i'm going to
wait in some dangerous territory and
this is
just for fun okay
nothing here is supposed to suggest a
policy change
just for fun it goes like this
i believe we know that coronavirus
infections
let me get myself out of the way will be
worse
if the initial exposure is higher
in other words if you were locked in a
phone booth with
three infected people and you stayed
there for six hours
you would get so much virus in that
little phone booth
that your sickness would probably be
more extreme
now this is what the experts told us
early on in the
pandemic i don't think it's changed
right
has anybody seen anything to counter
that so i think it's an established fact
that the greater the viral load let's
say enclosed spaces especially
the greater the fatalities and then
therefore it follows
that if you were to be exposed in a like
a passing manner let's say in the
you were shopping and you walked past a
few people who had it and it was just
sort of in the air
but it was just you were in and out it
follows that
these people would be more likely to be
infected with a lower viral road
load and therefore fewer fatalities
i'll ask now if there are any you know
doctors watching this
give me a fact check on that that's
still true right
that somebody says
directly linked okay so people seem to
be confirming it
in the comments so here's the part i
want to add to this
suppose you you had a policy that said
that your
you would do the same amount of
mitigation whether
it were in closed spaces or in open
spaces
and then you would get a result which is
a number of fatalities so that the
number of fatalities would be the result
of your national policy about what you
did in both of these places
it's sort of a blended average right
but suppose and again this is the
unethical part
this is the part that can't be tested
because it wouldn't be ethical to infect
people intentionally
there's no way you can do that ethically
so you can talk about it
but only if you're not a doctor right so
that's why i can do it
because you won't take me too seriously
and that's the right that's the right
mindset for this don't take me too
seriously
suppose and i'm just going to put this
out here
because i can't my brain can't quite get
the answer itself so i'm going to ask
you to help me out
and it goes like this suppose you said
don't wear masks in places where your
contact would be casual
just for example let's say that the the
guideline came out that says if you're
in a closed space
wear your mask if you're in an open
space
even let's say a trump rally you know
you're outdoors you don't have to wear a
mask
now would there be a lot more infections
if people didn't wear masks in uh let's
say
shopping centers and stores and rallies
the answer is yes it'd be tons more
right we all agree with that there would
be tons more
infections but they would be this kind
and these people would go through the
system and have
fewer fatalities so here's the question
i don't think it makes sense to go for
herd
immunity right i think the experts have
at least the experts in this country
have said that going for herd immunity
through
infection is a really bad idea
especially because of the
lingering health health problems that
you could have even if you recover
so even if you don't die you might have
some lingering problems which seem
pretty nasty
so there's no ethical way that anybody
should suggest
taking your mask off in the in
let's say a shopping center right so do
we agree with that
nobody ethical in the medical community
would ever suggest you take your mask
off in a public place
to give yourself an infection or on
average
more people get it just because it has
fewer fatalities
you can't ethically recommend that but
here's the math question forget about
the ethical part
i just want to understand the math if
you did
more of these infections it would be at
the expense of more of these wouldn't it
now this assumes also something about
how quickly the vaccinations are rolled
out
if the vaccinations could be rolled out
instantly
then wear your masks everywhere do you
agree
if you knew that the vaccinations would
be here in one week
and everybody would be vaccinated in one
week can't happen but
if you knew that you'd say all right i'm
just going to stay home for a week
because this is worth it right i'm not
going to take any chance for one week
but because we don't know how long it's
going to take could be six months etc we
know that there's going to be massive
extra infections would we be better off
again it's unethical to ask the question
but math-wise
just in the math would the fatalities go
down if people stopped wearing masks
in outdoor public places the infections
would go way
up but would they be lower viral load
and therefore the fatalities would go
down
now if it's not obvious to you why this
is not
ethical it's because if you said the day
you said don't wear your mask in public
you'd be killing people that didn't need
to be killed
you would kill extra people but you
also might get to the end of the
pandemic faster and save save more of
these kinds
so forget
forget my credibility you should assume
none
all right so for this conversation
assume i have no credibility i'm not
good at math and i don't know anything
about
science i'm just curious i'm just
curious
if we're being ethical at the expense of
being
successful i don't know
but i think it's a good question
all right let's see if there's anything
i haven't mentioned that you just have
to hear
um oh here's another another point on
the
if you're trying to build a habit and
keep it you'll see some people give you
this advice that you should have
cheat days if you let's say you're on a
diet
and you'll have okay every two weeks or
whatever is your schedule
i'll have a cheat day i think that's the
worst advice i've ever heard
it does make sense to allow yourself to
have days when it doesn't work
in other words if you say to yourself
you know i'm going to try to exercise
seven days a week but i'm
also living in the real world and
sometimes things come up
that's okay that's just living in the
real world
but the moment you allow yourself that
there's a cheat day
let's take food as the best example i
think that having a cheat day for food
is the number one worst way to diet
literally
there's nothing literally there would be
nothing
uh less effective than having a cheat
day and the reason is this
that if you're dieting successfully
you're not just eating less or eating
healthier
or exercising more those are all good
but you're also getting rid of your
cravings
if if you lose 20 pounds but you don't
lose your cravings
did you really lose 20 pounds because
they're coming back
right so if you think about weight loss
as weight
you've already lost right you might as
well not even bother
because if you think what you're trying
to do is lose weight
you'll never succeed if you're trying to
lose your cravings
well then your chances are very good so
i teach you in my book
how to fill almost everything and still
win big that is behind this whiteboard
i i teach you to work on your cravings
and then the weight loss works on itself
and
an example of that would be uh four i
used to be
addicted to snickers candy bars like i
i would almost drool when i woke up in
the morning i couldn't wait to get my
first one
and eventually you would progress to
like i'd be four of the big size
snickers a day
and i'd be like every bite of it would
actually make me feel alive and i'd be
like oh
i mean i would actually shudder with
craving for this particular food but
the technique i would use is let's say
how about i could eat anything i want
except that so every time i wanted that
i would eat something else that i also
liked and i wouldn't limit myself to the
other stuff
and then if i didn't eat those snickers
for i found out the it was about eight
weeks
so you might differ a little bit but
after eight weeks of not eating it
it didn't even taste good so right now
if i put one in my mouth i'd be like
i don't know why i like these in the
first place now my natural
biological you know preferences didn't
change at all in eight weeks what
changed is my addiction
i had an addiction to this certain fat
sugar
salt combination and by the way do you
know that's how they addict you
there's a book called i may have the
words reversed or
but it's like fat sugar salt or those
words might be in different order
and it teaches you how the scientists
found out that if you get the right
combination of those three materials
it's addictive like it actually
activates the addiction part of your
brain
so when i was eating the snickers i
thought i was overeating
in the old days but when i got smarter i
realized i wasn't overeating
i was addicted to certain foods that had
a bad outcome for me
so i would break each addiction
individually get rid of the craving
and then it's easy you know what once
the cravings are gone
you don't even think about it it's just
what you eat so at this point
i can eat a yam with some soy sauce on
it after
cooking it you know getting it nice and
soft and just eating a yam with some
pepper and soy sauce is like a
delightful meal
but only because i trained myself to get
rid of the addiction
food which i don't even miss now if you
told me how much do you miss your
favorite food
i'd say zero zero there's not even
one percent of me that wants to eat that
it's not like giving up cigarettes as i
understand it i've never given up
cigarettes
i don't smoke but my
what i hear is that even if you give up
as cigarettes and you're successful you
sort of always crave it
but you can actually get rid of a
craving for certain foods just it's just
gone
never comes back all right um
you're lying to yourself that uh
snickers bar is
greater than the soy on a yam i don't
know what that means
uh so he says the latest dr pepper
commercials cured my dr pepper addiction
yeah i had to cure my uh diet coke
addiction which was
probably 12 diet cokes a day so i guess
i do have
an addictive personality in some of the
food sense
but i've managed to work around it all
right
um these are your tips for the day
did you learn anything today any of this
helpful
we'll see all right and here's my last
question
is it ethical to travel
during the pandemic to places that are
open
since you know that traveling during a
pandemic increases the rate of
risk for not just yourself but for other
people
is it ethical to travel to places that
are open
just looking at your comments
see mostly yeses yeah and here's here's
my take on it i would say yes
it is ethical to do things which are
open
which is also why i've defended governor
newsom
california's governor newsom for eating
at the expensive french laundry
restaurant because
if it was open he can eat there
right that's it you know if if for
whatever reason it's open
i feel as if you should use it and
here's the ethical trade-off
those people who are selling those
services they need to live too
there's a reason they're open and the
reason is that
their government has decided that
keeping them open
and having customers is better than
closing them all things considered
so i think it is ethical to travel
during a pandemic
if you're traveling to places that are
open and they're open for a reason
you know so i'd say yes all right
i'm tripping right now somebody says uh
what if you've already had
coved well yeah then you're fine
we think um
if we know our immunity levels blah blah
blah blah blah it was not open
so somebody's saying that the french
laundry was not open here's what i have
not
heard i've not heard anybody say that
the french laundry was in trouble for
opening
illegally so i don't believe the wasn't
legal to be open part
there was something going on there but i
don't think the french laundry
was opening illegally inviting the
governor i don't i don't think that
happened
so there might be some details we don't
know about that but
somebody says how is a full airplane
allowed in the same city where all the
stores are closed
i guess that's the difference between uh
travel being necessary
and you know your your trinket store
maybe not being as necessary
what's my take on neural link that's uh
you're talking about elon musk's
invention or his startup that will
somehow put a
chip in your brain or or they'll i think
they drill into your skull and
implant something that can communicate
with your brain and then you can
directly control your environment
through your brain
well we're not there yet so i think it's
the implementation that matters
i assume we'll get there where you will
be
part machine and part person we're
already chemical cyborgs
because most of us are enhanced by some
kind of chemical at this point
so you know a chemical enhances me other
people might have a prescription drug
that is their chemical enhancement
but at this point pretty much all of us
are
at least chemical cyborgs you know we
don't operate
the way we were born and built based in
our dna
where dna plus a chemical that was
designed
now because that chemical is not a
machine like a like a microchip
we don't think you're a cyborg but if
you put a chemical machine into you
which is basically
you know a drug you're a cyborg
you're just a chemical kind so we'll be
real cyborgs whenever this neural link
gets going
and i don't think it's a question of
should we be merging with machines or
should we not
we're going to merge with machines so
don't even worry about should we or
should we not
because we're going to merge with
machines and those who do not
will be at such a disadvantage they're
going to want to merge with the machine
pretty soon too
so there we may have a problem where
there's a time where the
the rich or whatever the well-off can
merge with machines and have effectively
superpowers
imagine imagine just imagine this
imagine if you're in a conversation
and you could just think a google search
and the google search would come to your
brain
through this chip i don't know if any
that's possible by the way i don't know
if that's contemplated or possible
i'm just saying imagine a world it seems
like you could do it someday
maybe not soon but just imagine doing a
google search
without talking without using your
fingers while you're in the middle of a
conversation
imagine looking at somebody and being
able to tell their identity
by looking at them is that possible
well we already have facial recognition
apps you've heard of clear view right
law enforcement uses clearview they can
take a picture of anybody
and their identity will pop up if that
person has ever been
on social media so what if you have the
chip in your head
your eyes your eyes see a person
the chip takes what you see with your
eyes
turns it into an algorithm checks faces
and reads back and says to you you're
talking to
bill dillo jones he's an engineer at
intel
do you think that's possible well i
don't know that
neuralink would necessarily have the
technology to do that anytime
soon but my guess if i just had to guess
yup yeah i'll bet it's possible
you've seen the experiments and this was
years ago so it's been a while
where they could actually a computer can
create a picture
of what you're thinking you know that's
the thing right
they've already done that you can have
the the computer draw a picture based on
sensors on your head
of what you were imagining now it's a
grainy kind of approximate picture but
it's definitely what you were thinking
that already exists now imagine that got
better
i suppose they found out to get how to
get closer to wherever your optical
nerve
meets your brain is there a clearer
picture somewhere in your brain
because if the picture is clear you can
use facial recognition through the chip
in your head
you just look at somebody and say say in
your mind
who is this and your chip will google it
and it'll say bro jones you say hey bob
good to meet you how's the kids
i think that's where we're going maybe
in your lifetime not mine we'll see
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
you know it's so hard for me to turn off
these uh these live streams
i'm talking to you youtube i've already
turned off periscope
the reason it's so hard to end these
is that i'm getting probably more out of
it than you are
there's something about this that i've
never quite understood
and i think it has to do with the live
comments
because if i were doing this just you
know by myself
just recording it so you can see it
later
i wouldn't be that interested it's only
this live interaction that
that makes this a you know a two-way
thing
and even and i should tell you that even
if i'm not reading every comment because
sometimes i'm in my own head
when i'm presenting here um i see them
and i see the life and i see the you
know the
i you can detect emotion and whether you
can tell if what you're doing is going
over well or if or if you need to move
on
and it's really addicting really
addicting
now i don't know if you've noticed but i
use this medium differently than other
people
and i do a lot of a b testing so
sometimes you get lucky and
you try something and it works and the
one thing that i tried that i think
makes
all the difference with this medium is
that i
talk to you like i'm talking to one
person now i
mentioned the audience so you know i'm
talking to everybody but
in terms of uh style
it's like i'm talking to one person now
i do that intentionally
and that's something you could do
because of this two-way nature
the moment you put me on like say a
satellite and it's a recorded thing and
i'm just talking to the audience
i go into presenter mode do you know
what presenter mode looks like it'd be
like
and the next item here is uh item number
one i just wanted to mention you know
you go into presenter mode
but i found that with this medium it's
uniquely
resistant to that like i i feel like i'm
talking to you
like three people sitting around the
dinner table it doesn't feel like any
kind of presentation
and that's also dangerous because i've
said things in this context
that i really probably shouldn't have
said in public but it's that i feel like
i'm talking one-on-one
that you know i let my guard down
all right somebody said oh let me see
this this comment
bella bello says move away from trump
scott he's finished
just be interesting and be interactive
when you tell me to not do something you
know i just want to do more of it right
so when you tell me to move away from
trump because it's bad for me
uh you know i'm just gonna do more of it
all right um
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
