good morning everybody it's time for one
of the best experiences that you will
have over your entire life it's called
coffee with scott adams and i don't have
to tell you it's the best thing that's
ever happened in the history of the
universe because if you've ever been
here you already know it's true but
let's say
hypothetically
you wanted to take it up another notch i
don't even know if it's possible
but let's try it
and all you need is a copper of our
glass
tanker chalice or stein i can't eat
younger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes really everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it happen now go
ah
yeah you see after uh
that i think does it it's very much like
uh making noise when you have sex
if you've ever tried
having a silent orgasm
it's not as good
you're like
don't want the kids to hear it
but if you've ever had the experience of
nobody home
yeah it's the screaming that sells it so
it's just like the simultaneous sip
uh
a random internet user is
thanking me for being uh more upbeat
lately
and i have been trying to be not only
that but listen to this
talk about good news you want to hear
some good news how about some great news
you want to hear some great news
here it comes
lawrence livermore lab which is
practically walking distance from me
they have done a new experiment in which
they have gotten closer
to full
fusion
technology now if you don't know what
that is it's different than regular
nuclear
fission the normal way that we do things
because fusion should we ever be able to
solve this nearly unsolvable problem
would give give us free unlimited energy
everywhere forever
free unlimited energy well not really
free but the cost would approach free
over time as the cost of the electricity
would keep going down
now um it's a complicated area
nuclear uh fusion
so let me try to explain it to you in
layman's terms
because a lot of you uh you're not a
scientist
like me
so this would be all confusing to you so
let me break it down it's fusion
technology
and what you do is you shoot a a laser
beam
into a thing and then the laser beam
briefly creates a temperature
that
indirectly
creates the proton molecules of the
atoms
to wrap around the electrons in a way
that frees the energy
e equals mc squared and
i don't know if i can explain it any
clearer than that
but we're getting closer
to fusion is what i'm saying
i think that made sense
rasmussen is
uh saying that they did a survey
that says 62 percent of likely voters
think congress should investigate how
the afghan pull-out was handled
do you know why we need to ask congress
to investigate that
because there's nobody else who will
investigate it
do you remember when we used to have
investigative journalists who would like
to look into things and tell us what
really happened behind the scenes
apparently we don't have that anymore do
we
all we have is congress
congress can look into stuff
that's it
that's it that's all we got
we got congress to look into stuff
that's how broken our news industry is
that the only way you can find out what
happened
was to ask congress
now
if you're depending on congress
to tell you what's true
instead of the news business
you've sort of gone from the least
credible entity
that isn't in the public domain meaning
not elected officials into the least
credible people who have been elected
so could we get any information from
let's say some entity
that doesn't totally suck
wouldn't that be cool
well let's talk about our national
disgrace
the afghan pull-out
i'm reading today in the wall street
journal that the u.s says it left behind
the majority
of afghan interpreters and others who
applied for visas to flee afghanistan
what
we left behind the majority
i thought it was a national disgrace
to know we left anybody behind
anybody not just the americans but the
you know the translators and such who
are helping us
but
really
we left
the majority of them
behind have we ever had a national
disgrace of this size
in the past
40 years
well i mean if you go back further you
know you got the
tuskegee experiments and stuff so you
got plenty of disgusting things if you
go far enough back
but in the past 40 years
give give me an example of something
more shameful than this more disgraceful
in the last 40 years
can you think of one
water gate was nothing compared to this
wouldn't you say you know we always joke
about worse than watergate
i don't know benghazi
all the people who died in benghazi will
be
just a drop in the baka compared to
what's going to happen in afghanistan we
think
wmds
i don't know if that was a disgrace that
was just a huge mistake
but the afghan thing looks like some
intention
involved
and that looks like a disgrace
fast and furious now
i don't really see that as being as big
vietnam that's more than 40 years ago
iraq war
again the iraq war
was awful but i don't know if disgrace
is the right word for it it was like an
awful mistake which is different
i i put a different standard on people
who make mistakes
because those are somewhat unavoidable
and you know
in the big picture they're unavoidable
i don't know i i'm going to rank this
the biggest national displays in 40
years
and i don't see any pushback that i
would consider
you know valid against that point
let me ask you this if trump had been
president and had left behind the
majority of afghan interpreters
would we be labeling this racist
in the comments
that's my question would we be only
talking about it's racist
if we got all the uh mostly white people
out of there the americans
and left well i guess the afghans would
be technically white people although in
america we would refer to them as brown
because
we're all
racists
that's why right
there's no other reason
but in the united states we would refer
to the afghan people as brown
because we're racist
there's no other reason right it's not
because they're brown um
this is one of those moments you just
realize what a damn racist you are even
if you're not trying
it's it's always been my belief
that you can't not be a racist because
your your brain is built to do pattern
recognition but not very well
if it was really good at pattern
recognition maybe you'd be less of a
racist well it's not very good at it
so you end up you know you have to try
hard to overcome your natural
your natural brain bias
uh here's an example of it all right
um i'm hearing today i don't know if
this is a scoop or not but
apparently the state department won't
let private aircraft take off uh with
american allies and and americans on it
in afghanistan
what
the state department won't let private
aircraft take off with americans and
afghans that we're trying to rescue
like right now
and apparently tom cotton's office is
working on this
among others
or this from jonah shumate
and
i don't know you know every time i hear
tom cotton's name
he's doing something useful
he's either
you know fighting against china or
against something but why is it that
every time somebody is doing something
useful
it's one of three or four
elected officials why is it always the
same people
should we even be looking at anybody
else as a potential president
seriously
i mean you're looking at desantis he's
doing real stuff so yeah potential
president
tom cotton doing real stuff
potential president
all right
so
anyway um i don't know the details
behind this story but uh the state
department has some explaining to do and
i don't know if they're explaining it
well enough to send it for senator
cotton to be happy but i'd like to hear
a little bit more from senator cotton's
office
on what he needs from us
might need a little more public support
you know i've told you before that
our form of government is largely
basically it's a social media government
because social media determines what you
can and cannot get away with right if
social media is against something it's
just not going to happen and if social
media is for something strongly it's
probably going to happen
so maybe we can help
we've got stranded people in afghanistan
that we'd like to get out
senator cotton
yes you need any help can you tweet
something we'll we'll help you retweet
it at least get some more attention to
it
try to be helpful
um
i have a theory that or a hypothesis
that the biggest medical problem in this
country
is a well-deserved lack of trust in the
media
the biggest medical problem in the
country is that we don't trust the media
now that wasn't always true because we
weren't in a pandemic
but during a pandemic
if you can't trust
the messenger
you know forget about who's the the
source of the message if you can't trust
the messenger
that's a gigantic health problem isn't
it
because we don't trust cnn to give us uh
health related news because we've seen
them lie so many times on other news
so
i feel as if
it's the biggest medical problem in
in the world
or at least the country the biggest
medical problem is the news
and that's a that's a sad
thing but i think it's true
all right how about some potential good
news anybody anybody would you like some
potential good news
here are some that
i don't know
i've got a feeling about this one
let's call this a hunch
that this
is a really big deal now it's it's a
really small deal now
but here's my hunch that what i'm going
to tell you next
could be
a really big deal
apparently there was a test on
mouthwashes to see if mouthwashes would
uh
cancel out the virus in your mouth turns
out that some of them do so not all of
them
don't don't assume that one in your
medicine cabinet is going to help you at
all
but two that they did find is that
listerine and a prescription mouthwatch
wash that has a
chlorhexidine in it can disrupt the
virus within seconds
um
and that's a big deal because we know
especially with the delta
variant that your mouth and nose are
just full of virus compared to i guess
the original
so you got a lot more in your mouth and
nose how much less
would you be affected
and how much less could you spread it if
you could kill all of it in your mouth
let's say you didn't even know
let's say you didn't even know you had
it but you just did mouthwash every day
and then i added to this story my own
little twist because the mouthwash would
take care of the mouth but not the nose
could you put some kind of chemical like
that you know a normal over-the-counter
chemical
could you please don't do this
i don't even know if i could say this
i just realized i was going to say
something that might get me banned
forever from social media
so i'm going to try to figure out a way
to say it that it doesn't sound like a
recommendation
are you all adult enough that you can
handle a speculation without going out
and taking dangerous drugs
can i trust you to do that
can i trust you that if i say hey
i wonder if this would work
don't go out and do it
please
dear god don't go out and do what i'm
going to say right now
please
do you hear this as clearly as possible
don't do this
but is there any way that we could put
this stuff in a neti pot
do you know what a neti pot is it's a
you fill it with a salt
usually just salt and water and warm
water and you shoot up one nostril and
it goes into your nasal cavity and comes
out the other nostril as for is for
preventative
stuff for you know allergies and
whatever
now
if a mouthwash
can clear out your mouth
could the neti pot
clear out your nose
with some kind of a formula
and again don't do this
don't do this
don't put anything in your neti pot
please don't
i'm just speculating so here's what i
think might happen
suppose we found out two
over-the-counter drugs that would
easily take care of the mouth and then
something you could easily put into your
neti pot
that would also take care of the nose do
you think we could find an
over-the-counter thing that would do
that probably
probably i mean if this
if this research bears out probably
then
uv light
why is ass
james
uh
then suppose you said
for one month i would like all the
citizens of the united states maybe just
the adults because the kids wouldn't do
it i'd like all these citizens in the
united states to use mouthwash and a
neti pot for one month
what would happen
right
if everybody did it for a month even if
they had some coveted and they didn't
know it
they'd be knocking it back pretty hard
and it'd probably make a difference i
mean it's not going to cure the pandemic
but
i feel like it would make a difference
so anyway if this mouthwash study
has any validity and we don't know that
yet could be a big deal
uh christopher hill tweets on twitter
which is exactly where you go to tweet
um we've been talking a lot about the uh
and i'll tell you why in a minute but
the remember the schumer quote about how
our intelligence people have quote six
ways from sunday to get back at you
they were talking about uh
trump
now
here's my question somebody asked if
they think if i think that our
intelligence services
have uh corrupted the
the election
if chuck schumer can say in public
that our own intelligence agencies have
six ways from sundays to get back at you
if you're president
he was talking about trump
the intelligence agencies have a way to
get revenge on you if you're the
president of the united states
so forget about you
that's dangerous enough
all right
but
was chuck schumer warning us that our
own intelligence agencies could
rig an election in this country
was he
because is six ways from sunday these
are all the ways that an intelligence
agency can get back into president
six ways from sunday
is the category six ways from sunday
which is a pretty big category because
sunday is a big category but six ways
from sunday you know that's the whole
week it's the whole week
so they got lots of ways they can get
back to you
are you telling me that we're going to
rule out
that one of the ways is to rig an
election
really
why do we rule that out do we rule it
out because there's no proof of it
right i've seen no proof of it
but um
you you know my take my take is that
uh all elections that have certainly if
they have electronic voting machines
they're either already corrupted
or they will be
because there's no scenario in which
they won't be in the long run
do you know why you can guarantee that
elections will be corrupted
because it's possible
that's the one and only thing you need
to know
now does anybody
disagree
that it's possible
let me tell you how
you get an insider in one of the
technology companies that's counting
votes you corrupt the insider you you
turn them you make you you own them
either blackmail them or bribe them
whatever it takes
and then the insiders do the rest
standard intelligence operation you get
the insiders to do the work for you okay
so are you telling me that that's not
possible
are you telling me that an intelligence
agency
working for a hundred years
couldn't penetrate an election
now most of the time they couldn't
probably you know i'm guessing you would
fail more often than it would succeed
but because it's possible
and because the history will just keep
going on and
presumably people will try until they
get it right
it's pretty much guaranteed
the only thing you need to know
is that it's possible
and then you can guarantee it you just
don't know when that's the only thing
you don't know is if it happened already
or if it's in our future but it's
guaranteed
that we know
all right
and chuck schumer has confirmed that cnn
is trying to equate uh the taliban with
white supremacists in this country
of course they are
here's how they equate them
uh they're equating the
white supremacists and taliban because
the taliban is or at least the white
supremacist
on social media are saying
some things like uh
you know they're they're praising the
taliban for being anti-gay and anti-jew
because they are too
uh there's a comparison
and they quickly took over the country
and applied their religious rule
so
i don't think white supremacists are
exactly praising the taliban
i think they're praising them by analogy
which is very very different
right they're not saying we support the
taliban
they're saying hey
by analogy
you know they did some bad
things to people that we'd like to do
some bad things to or like to avoid or
whatever
and so it's just sort of like an analogy
but it's just an analogy
it's literally an analogy it has nothing
to do with white supremacists you know
teaming up with the taliban or anything
like that just crazy news
well texas is continuing to morph into
becoming its own country
not only do they have you know
they're a little different in terms of
dropping their covalent restrictions
not so different than florida but
different than most of the rest of the
country
but now they've got a texas has its own
social media bill
that would stop social media giants with
more than 50 million users
from banning any texans for political
statements
so in texas you just got freedom of
speech
if assuming it stands up
so texas has instituted a freedom of
speech
rule we'll see if that stands
but it's not happening elsewhere yet
or is it give me a fact check on that if
it is
also in texas
they have their own unique
abortion ban in effect it's an abortion
ban because it limits you to the first
six weeks or before the heartbeat or
something along those lines
and the supreme court has denied a
request to overturn it so justice
roberts sided with the three
three liberal justices and dissent but
they did not win
and
that means that getting a uh an abortion
in texas will be really hard
really hard now my prediction is that
this is bad for the texas economy
maybe not in a way they'll notice
because they won't notice what could
have happened they'll just notice what
did happen
so i would think that a lot of young
people will avoid texas for this this
reason alone
actually let me put that stronger
a lot of talented people
will either move out of texas or not
move there if they were planning to
because of this law
so whether or not you think the abortion
change in texas is good or bad and i'm
not going to debate that today that's up
to you
um
it's bad for the economy
i would think because nobody's going to
move there to ban their own abortions
right
there's nobody who's gonna say oh good i
can go there and have
fewer possibilities of abortion because
people will just not get an abortion if
they care about it and for themselves
so it can only hurt their economy there
doesn't seem to be any feasible way it
could help
and we'll see if that makes a difference
texas also has a pro-gun law that lets
you
openly carry your firearm in public
without a permit
even if you don't have any
firearms training
now here's what i love about this
i love the fact that texas is testing
this out
because scott is misunderstanding the
law in all capitals
um i'm not misunderstanding the law that
it will prevent 85 percent of the
abortions
so i mean that's the only part that
mattered here but the uh the texas pro
gun law
um
i think that's really worth testing
i like the fact that our our states are
like little laboratories where where one
state can say we want to try something
different see what happens now if i had
to make a prediction
i feel like the pro-gun law and the open
carry is going to reduce
crime
and death
i think i wouldn't say i'm 100 confident
about that or anything else
but i feel like
i don't know
if i had to put odds on it
65 chance is going to reduce crimes
what do you think
i'm going to say 65 chance it will
reduce crime but
you could imagine there would be
individual cases where something happens
that wouldn't have happened otherwise
you know if you have access to a gun
you're more likely to use it than if you
don't
yeah i mean you could be skeptical of
that we're just guessing but uh i'm glad
it's being tested that's all
all right joe rogan uh has coved
and uh
we're of course hoping for a speedy
recovery
joe rogan one of the one of our national
treasures i think i think he's can we
say that yet is he too young for that
he may be too young to to refer to him
that way but but he's certainly well on
his way to being national treasure
um we we value him a great deal
but even if you don't agree with him you
have to value you know what he's doing
um
and
how much of our medical advice are we
going to get from joe rogan's
experience
i feel like a lot
i feel as if and and this isn't joe
rogan's fault but he's just a public
figure and he has a lot of credibility
with a lot of people
so whatever his experience is and what
whatever he says about it is probably
going to be pretty darn influential
more so than the rogue doctor of viral
video that you know is disagreeing with
everybody and what makes this
interesting is he's taken a little i
guess he was not vaccinated that's part
of the story
i'm assuming that because i didn't see
it in the story
but he took some monoclonal antibodies
and some ivormectin controversially and
some prednisone and i don't know
something else and
says he's feeling better
now this raises of course the question
about ivermectin
is ivermectin
the real deal
is joe rogan being smart
by taking it
well let's talk about it
number one
um
here's something that if you lean
politically right
and i think that describes nearly all of
my audience even though i don't lean
right
most my audience does
most of you have never seen a cnn
cited
paper
in which the studies on ivermectin the
big the good ones the randomized
controlled
types uh studies
have been evaluated and when they take
out the ones that have obvious bias
uh there's no evidence of ivermectin
working
how many of you know that there's a july
study
a study of studies
looking at all the other ivermectin
studies and they throw out the ones that
are obviously biased
and they they use the ones that are the
the most unbiased and when you do that
it shows there's no evidence that
ivorbectin works no clear evidence
there's ambiguity
but there's no clear evidence that it
works
based on this now
i linked to this study on twitter just
before i got on and what happened
the link went to a dead page
now the page is not dead but i must have
sent so much traffic there i i killed
the server
so wait for the server to go up because
a lot of you think i was doing a prank
it looked like it was a prank because it
sent you to a blank page but it's a real
page i checked the link myself again to
make sure i had the right link and i did
and
um
we'll talk about the risk in a second
so
but i'm just gonna ask you how many you
were aware if you lean right
so that's most of you
how many you were were aware
that there's a study of these studies
and it shows that the studies don't show
it works how many of you even knew it
existed
because i didn't until today
today is the day
that i learned there was a study of
studies
a brand new one that means july of this
year that shows i've rebecca and doesn't
have any obvious benefit
now i'm not saying that study is
accurate
right i make no claim of the accuracy of
that or any other study
but i didn't know it existed
did you
i've been listening to
the the weinsteins you know brett
weinstein i've been listening to him
talking about the meta studies
and
i didn't know there was another side to
it
so i had a enormous blind spot and i
read cnn literally every day
every day i look at news on the left and
i study it
pretty completely
and i didn't know it
now how does that make you feel
i i mean most of you are news junkies or
you wouldn't be here but
i i i read all of the news
and i didn't know that
it's such a big deal and i didn't know
it till today
it's so easy to miss something of that
size
all right so most of you probably missed
it too now i'm not claiming that that
study is the good one
i'm just saying i didn't know it existed
all right
here is how the propagandists and
brainwashers are treating the ivermectin
story and i think the joe rogan
situation is causing them to be a little
more active
the fda is warning us today that taking
too much ivermectin can be dangerous
that helps you doesn't it
that's some good medical advice
taking too much ivermectin can be
dangerous
it's a good thing that the fda warned me
that taking too much of a drug could be
dangerous did you know that
did you know that overdosing on a drug
could be dangerous
huh
do you know what else could be dangerous
if you took too much
water
water yeah if you drink too much water
you'll die
son
if you go out in the sun too long you'll
get sun cancer you'll die
um is there any drug that won't kill you
if you take too much of it
i don't know
how about too much candy
can you die from eating too much candy
yeah
pretty much everything
pretty much everything will kill you if
you get too much of it so you can tell
that that's propaganda
because they're not telling you about
too much of anything else
just too much of this
um
they also say
that you shouldn't take a horse dewormer
don't take any horse dewormer except
that's not what we're talking about
yes there are idiots taking horse
dewormer don't take a horse don't take
horse medicine
but if you see the fda or anybody else
cnn for example referring to ivormectin
as horse dewormer
that's just propaganda because there are
two versions of it there's the human
version and then there is the horse
version but if you're calling the human
version
horse dewormer you're not reporting the
news
you're not trying to help
you're trying to be a brainwasher
so that's how you know the brainwashing
is happening
it's real obvious in this case they
speak of it as horse dewormer and tell
you not to take an overdose of it
like everything
all right
um glenn greenwald is calling out the
deep state
because somebody somebody leaked a call
with biden and
the ex-president of afghanistan ghani
and i guess this is what
biden said to gandhi on this phone call
that was leaked
i need not tell you the perception
around the world and in parts of
afghanistan i believe is that things are
not going well in terms of the fight
against the taliban so this was you know
prior to the taliban taking over
and there is need whether it is true or
not
this is the controversial part and there
is need whether it is true or not
there is need to project a different
picture
so biden
literally asked ghani to lie
and and that got leaked
now
who leaked that
was it
the intelligence
people
did the intelligence people leak this
and if they did and this i think
greenwald is suggesting that's a likely
likely place that happened and if it is
true
what would make you think they wouldn't
rig an election
i'll just put these two questions
together
if you think it's true and i don't know
what it is but if you think the most
likely place that this leak came from is
our own intelligence services
what would make you think they wouldn't
rig an election
because they're rigging an election
right now
they're trying to get
biden out of office
this is exactly the kind of leak
that is intended
to rig an election
by giving you news you wouldn't have had
otherwise
that changes your opinion of what
happened
this is rigging the election
don't tell me the intelligence agencies
are not trying to rig the election
if they did this and that i don't know
right
because we don't have proof that they
did it could have been somebody else
but if they did it
don't tell me they don't rig elections
that's just stupid because we would be
watching it right in front of us
this is ringing an election
if it's true we don't know if it is
but i would also defend biden and
let me say this again
if trump had said this i would defend it
okay hear this clearly
if trump had made this phone call
i would defend it i would defend what he
said and i'm going to do the same for
biden
because i like to be at least a little
bit
objective right at least try
you know i can't do it every time
everybody's biased but i'm going to try
and here's how i defend it
if
because reality is
reality and impression are very
connected
if the afghan president had done a
better job of telling everybody
everything was fine
what would have been the outcome
suppose biden had gotten what he wanted
and the afghan president had done what
biden asked and told everybody that
things were better than they looked
what would be the the outcome of that
well i think the outcome biden wanted
was that it would give the afghan army
confidence to fight
it looks like that's the obvious thing
he wanted and if they had gotten
confidence to fight could they have
lasted longer
against the taliban
maybe i mean we don't know but it's a
reasonable assumption
if
if our leaders of our country are
convincing a leader of another country
to
lead
to actually tell them something that's
not entirely exactly accurate
but it might get them to a better place
i'm not sure that's wrong now it might
have been wrong for afghanistan
but it wasn't wrong for america
and that's who biden works for
biden works for america
and if it was good for america
for our president to ask this guy to lie
to his people i think there's a pretty
good argument that it would have been
good for america it would have bought us
some time right that was the whole point
now would it be ethical no
no
it's not even close to ethical
would it be impeachable i don't know
because it would be in america's best
interest
and i think that's got to matter
so let me say it clearly if trump had
said this to ghani i would defend him
biden said it to gani and i'd defend him
you don't have to like it
um
but he clearly didn't ask him to lie
and it would suggest that uh biden was
aware that uh af the the the afghan
government was gonna fall so that's a
separate question
that biden was more aware of how quickly
things would devolve but there again
suppose biden was aware of it
should he have told us
no
no he shouldn't have if biden was aware
that things were going worse than they
looked he should not have told us
because that would have accelerated how
badly they went
it's a tough place to be
um
so glenn greenwald is using this as
evidence that uh definitely the the deep
state exists
all right let's talk about long covid
there's a new study
that says this is the world's biggest
study on the issue for kids where their
kids are getting long coveted so they
studied
uh 11 to 17 year olds who had tested
positive for coronavirus and they they
saw how long their symptoms lasted
the research suggests that somewhere
between two and fourteen percent
still had symptoms uh from covid 15
weeks later
now they did have to get rid of all that
um i guess the
uh
there were a lot of people who had
symptoms but people just naturally do
have symptoms for other reasons so
somehow they could get get rid of that
effect and they already down to between
two and fourteen where did they get the
fourteen percent and where did they get
the two percent because that's a pretty
big range
the 14 is what the the survey produced
so their own data
said 14
so why don't they pre
why don't they report 14
because that's what the data said
why did they say between 2 and 14
because wouldn't you make a different
decision if you thought it was 2
than if you thought it was 14.
wouldn't you i mean that would have it
make a difference for your calculation
and
um
here's how they got it to two percent
they looked at their own data and said
uh we think our own data is bad it's
probably closer to two percent
what
that's like the opposite of science
they looked at their own data and said
you know i'm not sure people would
answer the question right or or no they
said
they think their data was biased by the
people who who answered the questions
meaning that if you had symptoms you're
more likely to answer the question
so in other words they did a survey
and then they threw away all their data
and said well we think it would have
come out differently
if we had different data
so
i'm going to put the credibility of
the of this as zero
um
i i saw it being used as evidence that
we should not worry about kids in long
covered because it you know might be two
or three percent
but i don't think that's what the data
said
the data set is 14
now if the people who did it are
questioning their own data
i don't think you could just make up
what you think it should have been
is that is that science
are you supposed to look at the science
and say you know
if we'd done this better i think we
would have gotten a different result so
let's just go with that different result
like i don't know how much different
from science you could be from that
but anyway
there you have it
um
i think the joe rogan situation is going
to be
especially interesting because whatever
happens to him
people are going to be more influenced
by it because they know him and they'll
watch the whole thing play out and
everything
so i have a feeling that
whatever he says about his experience is
just going to have a huge
medical impact in this country
and you've watched me try as hard as i
can not to persuade anybody about
vaccinations
because i've got a problem with the
ethics of it
because people like me can be
influential
even if we don't try to be right it's
just part of having a public platform
and joe rogan's influence is i don't
know i mean it's almost unparalleled
isn't it in terms of reach and
credibility so whatever he does
um he's in a tough spot
because if he wants to be
you know true and honest with his
experience
it's going to have a side effect of
influencing people to do whatever he did
or things worked
and that's that's sort of an ethical
conundrum isn't it and i'll i'll be very
interested to see how he he handles it
because i would i would trust him to
know how to handle this right actually
so let's watch it see how he does
um
and that
is just about everything i wanted to
talk about
so i would call this one of the best
live streams you've ever seen in your
whole life there's one thing i would
like to add
um i'm gonna make a claim
and this will teach you some persuasion
at the same time okay so i'll make a
claim
but it's really a lesson it's two things
here's the claim
the most influential book on success
is my book
had failed almost everything and still
win big
and i'm going to claim that it's the
most influential book in the last 10
years
for
success
now influential is different than best
book
i don't know what is the best book that
you know if i knew what the best book is
i probably would have would have written
that book i guess so nobody nobody knows
what the best book is that's a different
question
but the most influential
now influential is more objective
because you can just say oh all right
did this person get influenced by it or
not
and you can see that they say they did
and you will see for example that
uh when people do their top five
best business books or success books
it's almost always in the top five
and here's the other part
there will be at least one book on that
other list of the top five
that was influenced by my book
so when you see top five lists
40 of it is my book
i don't think anything's ever been close
maybe seven habits of highly effective
people back in his day but if you look
at the last 10 years
i think that book is the most
influential book on on
success oh pippenberg just finished it
last night thank you
um so i'm going to put that out there
all right here's here's the lesson on
persuasion
what lesson what what persuasion trick
did i just use
in the comments
what persuasion did i just use
um
social proof
correct keep going
social proof
visual not so much think past the sale
correct
think past the sale yeah
i'm trying to get you to think about
whether it's the number one best book in
the entire world
but in order for you to think about that
question
you have to uncritically accept that
it's in the top five
right
so if you're going to buy a book knowing
it's in the top five probably is pretty
good
but i do think quite legitimately this
is not a lie and it's not hyperbole i do
think it's actually the most influential
book on success
for the past 10 years
i think that's actually literally
measurably true
best book i don't know but most
influential pretty sure
all right that's all we got for today
uh i need to go run and do something
else and i will talk to you
tomorrow
