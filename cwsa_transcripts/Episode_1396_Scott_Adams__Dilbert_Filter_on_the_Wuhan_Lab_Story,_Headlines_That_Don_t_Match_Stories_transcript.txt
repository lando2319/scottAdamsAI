hey everybody you know i said by
uh twitter this morning that this might
be
one of the best coffees with scott adams
of all time
let me check my notes
yeah yeah it's true it's the best one
of all time and
before we get to the simultaneous sip
because i know there's some kind of a
delay here that
blocks you from seeing it but until we
get to that let me tell you a little
story i have long believed
that the past can be changed
by what happens in the in the present
now this is a form of
affirmations because the idea with
affirmations
is that when you're affirming something
you say oh i want
this to work out or or this part of my
life to be better
that in order for those things to happen
as if by magic
which is often the way you observe them
i'm not saying magic exists
i'm saying you you feel like it's magic
when something happens just the way you
wanted it to happen
but in order for that to happen often
the past
has to be altered or at least seem like
it's been altered
and what i mean is let me give you an
example you heard the story i think some
of you
in which i was experimenting with
christina to see if we could simply use
affirmations
to make money show up substantial money
that we had not anticipated something
that wasn't related to my normal work
just money showing up and sure enough
it turns out that sometime in the past
maybe over a year ago
i had inadvertently left some
cryptocurrency just a little bit in an
account
that i forgot i had which is worth a
quarter of a million dollars today
just came out of nowhere now
what are the odds that i was doing this
affirmation for money to command in
nowhere
exactly when it happened what are the
odds
well if affirmations is let's say real
or we live in a simulation
it could be that i altered the past
because in my model of
reality you can alter the past
under one condition all right what is
the one condition in which you can
alter the past hypothetically we're just
talking for fun here
but if we live in a simulation and you
can change it
you'd have to be able to change the past
for the events to
work their way up to the future to be
just the way you want it
because if the past isn't just the way
you want it neither will the future
so yeah so so you're close
the one time under this model if this
were true
the one time you could change the past
is when there's no
counter evidence in other words nobody
has already looked into the past that
you know of
and found it to be different than the
than the past you want it to be
well yesterday i got a hundred dollars
in the mail
uh and thank you james you're probably
watching this right now
and but this is cheating one of my
viewers
sent me some free money to make my
affirmations come true
thank you now the rest of you don't send
me any money
you don't need to be sending me money
right
but thank you it was kind of funny and
you definitely got my attention
so thanks for doing that but maybe you
can change the past is all i'm saying
and how would you like to enjoy the
simultaneous sip
oh i made you wait i made you wait
some of you are thinking wait a minute
did i already miss the simultaneous zip
no it's coming now and all you need is a
copper marker glass of tanker chelsea
stein a canteen cherry flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like that's right coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day i'm going to
mix in a little serotonin
just a dash of oxytocin this is going to
be the good one
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now all over the world
go
you know if tony robbins had come up
with this idea
maybe he could have made something of
himself
well let's talk about all the things uh
looks like
bill gates and warren buffett are major
investors in
in a nuclear energy i think it's a
fourth generation
nuclear reactor now if you don't know
what a fourth
generation nuclear reactor is the
definition is a
little squishy but basically it means a
safer
more economical form of
nuclear energy you might not be aware
i think this is true that there's never
been a major problem with
current the the newest type of
nuclear power do be a fact check
fact check on that but i think it's true
that uh
generation three which is what you would
build today
not counting this bill gates thing i'll
talk about but
up until today any new plant would have
been the so-called
third generation i believe there's never
been an accident in one of those that
killed anybody
but check check that out i think only
second generation or
prior have ever had an accident
because we know how to do it now third
generation i don't think there's ever
been one
but fact check me on that i think i'm
right anyway but even
way safer than the third generation
which
probably has never killed anybody i
think
um the uh the new stuff
is even better and so wyoming has
decided to partner with
the gates and warren buffett funded
entity
i think it's terrapower but it's this is
going to be the natrium power plant
and it's expected to be more fuel
efficient cost-effective and
safer i don't know if it actually eats
the waste from traditional plants but
some of the generation four will do that
i don't know if this one does this uh
here's my
take on this we
we quite rightly do a lot of complaining
about the
you know the income gap and the wealth
gap in the world
it doesn't seem fair that people are
starving at the same time somebody has
a hundred billion dollars right your
sense of fairness just
it's hard to process that but it is
nonetheless true
that our mega billionaires can do some
things
that the government can't why does the
government do anything for you
like why do you have a government the
point of a government
is that the government has god-awful
amount of money in power
so they can just do stuff that requires
a
god-awful amount of money and power
but fast forward to 2021
our billionaire class
our billionaire class has god awful
amount of money
that they can focus on particular
projects you know they don't they don't
have the government kind of money
so they can't focus everywhere which
wouldn't make sense but a bill gates
and a warren buffett could just say all
right here's a problem the government
isn't fixing
and then they just go fix it now what
are the odds that this power plant will
work out the way they hope
i don't know you know it's the first of
it's the first of its kind
it's the first of its kind so maybe
they'll you know
be little stops stops and starts
but whether it's perfect on the first
try
or or they you know they tweak it later
this is amazing news
you do you understand how big a news
this is if you've been following
the the whole climate change and even
especially the nuclear energy field
let me let me put a value on this in
terms of
what this could mean for the planet
it's a 10 and a 10. did you know that
that this news is a 10 out of 10 for the
health of the planet
i mean this is this is so big it's
almost incalculable
if it works right now even if it doesn't
work like i said it probably moves us
closer to the one that does
you know they might have to tweak it or
whatever but this is amazing news
is it the top headline no
no is there anything more important
happening in the world
than this yeah you know the pandemic and
you know china is rising and we've got
genocide and
those things but this is right up there
this is one of the biggest stories on
the planet
golden age what do you think
i think the golden age is coming there's
more on this too
jobs report came out it's a little less
than people
expected is that bad news the jobs
report came out
and there are fewer people going back to
work than people hoped
is that good news or bad news
nothing it's nothing news because
there's so many jobs that are unfilled
we don't have anything like an
employment problem
so you can actually just stop talking
about employment
it actually doesn't matter have you ever
seen a time
in in the history of well your life
have you ever seen a time when the
employment rate didn't even matter
it was like the one statistic that we
all thought was the most important
your your employment levels basically
tell you how the entire economy is going
to go
how the entire economy goes tells you
everything
normally but we we've reached this
bizarre situation where there are open
jobs
and there are people without those jobs
and they're not especially
hurrying to get them because they have
the benefits from the
from the the government largesse
so the jobs reports means nothing but i
imagine the
stock market will move anyway you know
it'll
well let me check did the stock market
move on the jobs reports
because it shouldn't and the answer is
the market went up
all right so so as i predicted
the fact that the jobs report is not
excellent
didn't change the market at all and it
shouldn't so that's actually irrational
for once it's rational
all right let's put the dilbert filter
on this question about the
wuhan lab and the the fouchy
stuff so here's some little backgrounds
and new things that we're learning about
it
uh i guess dr fauci gave a wide-ranging
interview
recently um in which he said he was
asked if he
believed his own uh national institute
of uh
allergy and infectious diseases could
have any responsibility for the global
pandemic
now the the reasoning here is that maybe
he approved it was part of approving
some funding
that made its way through the wuhan lab
that may have been involved in some way
in gain of function
may have contributed to the outbreak is
is
at least the allegation and or question
and here's how dr fauci answered it he
said quote
are you really saying that we are
implicated
because we gave a mil a multi-billion
dollar institution
120 000 a year for bat surveillance
now this is according to the financial
times and they didn't publish the
question he was asked
but the answer is pretty interesting
without the question
i hope i hope we're not losing any
context here so just
put a little check mark in that box in
your brain that says
might be some missing context but for
now i'm going to treat it like it's true
so here's the first dilbert filter
you're going to talk to your boss and
you want to ask him for a lot of money
all right so you go to your boss you say
i need a lot of money what's the best
way to
express it well if you want it to sound
like it's a small amount of money
you say it's 120 000 per year
not that much if you want to make it
sound like a large amount of money
you say it's 600 000 because that's what
five years of 120 000 dollars gets you
so fauci calls it 120 000 a year
his critics call it six hundred thousand
so the first thing is uh the deliberate
principle is beware of the weasel
numbers
so weasel numbers comes right out of
dilbert right every big organization
does weasel numbers where they may be
accurate
but but where you focus and whether you
say it's one year
or multiple years is really just
persuasion
it's just you know corporate
organizational
right so that's the first thing
number two how do you know
that any specific money got
spent in a way that has nothing to do
with gain a function it's a
multi-billion dollar operation
presumably with lots of shared and
overlapping
functions and equipment probably the
spaces that
that they use probably overlap with
whoever
may or may not be doing gain a function
with people doing
other things so if you pump a little bit
of money into this
big you know organization full of
dilberty scientists
how do you know if the money was spent
on anything what what if there was a lab
that they needed to build for gain of
function but they also needed it for
other reasons
did the money fund the gain of function
or was it going to happen anyway
because they needed to build a lab that
does a number of things
i'm not entirely sure you can even
determine
what is gain of function even if they're
doing it
right now i believe fouchy actually said
you know we don't have control of what
happens after the money goes over there
and we don't even have a lot of
visibility we were just sort of trusting
that
things were going well so there are
certainly some big questions about
oversight and
you know and uh you know ability to know
what's happening over there
so that's a very diligent situation you
give a bunch of money to somebody
and you don't exactly know why they're
spending it
right the dilbert filter works on every
part of this
if you just assume that it works like
every other big corporation
every other big organization everything
makes sense
like suddenly you go oh okay so it makes
sense here's some other
dilberty examples uh weasel words
in any big corporation in any dilberty
situation
people are going to use weasel words
here's an example
uh fauci refers to funding quote
bat surveillance
does funding bat surveillance include or
not include
gain of function do you know
i don't know i don't know if the big
category that you funded is
bat surveillance what's in that
is part of your bat surveillance may be
tweaking a little bit
i don't know do you know so this is this
is classic
you know weasel wording i don't know why
why would you talk about gain of
function we just got some
bat surveillance here now
question why was it done in wuhan
was it because they were closer to the
bats and the wet markets
and so they could you know do a little
more direct
research because they're right there
where things happen maybe
do you know what's uh do you know what
would be another good reason
to fund the wuhan lab instead of doing
it in the united states
anybody anybody what would be a
perfectly smart reason
to fund this research in china
instead of boston
what would be a good reason to do that
besides the fact
that they have access to more of the
wildlife
implicated in this somebody says no
snitches
maybe in case of escape
let me ask you this if you knew that dr
fauci
had some money to look into
you know being more cautious about bat
viruses
if you knew he had some money and it was
going to be spent for that
would you want him to build that lab or
fund a lab to do this
where you live or would you like to fund
this lab in the middle of a chinese
population center
i feel as if maybe that wasn't the worst
idea in the world
now i don't know if this research we
could trust
what they learned from it to all come
our way or maybe they're doing
stuff that only goes to the chinese
government that's a big problem
that's a big problem and the lack of
transparency it's a big problem
but i don't think you could ignore the
fact
that you're happy it wasn't in boston
anybody anybody you're still happy it
was over there right
and i can't imagine that wasn't part of
the decision
let's get that over there we don't
want it around here
and if wuhan had closed down a little
more effectively
if china had closed down more
effectively as effective as they were
uh maybe that wouldn't have gotten out
so it wasn't a bad idea to
put that away from us all right here's
some more
dilbert filter on this
um does it seem to you
that the entire reason that we're so
confused about what got funded over
there and who funded what
to do what it seems like a cover your
ass
situation right there is a report that
there even people in the state
department were saying no
don't push this wuhan lab leak
because then people are going to ask
questions about our stuff
is that reasonable would you think it
were reasonable
that the united states anybody
associated with this kind of work
is it reasonable for them to say you
know if we start asking questions about
the wuhan lab
there's no way you can contain that
there's gonna they're gonna be asking
questions about us
next because you just can't separate it
you just can't
so would it be reasonable to say that
the united states
knew they were doing something wrong and
that's why they wanted to cover their
ass
in the comments answer this question
this will test your worldliness
how much do you understand about reality
and the way with the way things work
uh i forgot how i asked the questions
now i don't know what the yes means
but the question the question should be
do you think that that the u.s the
people who were in the know
do you think that they would try to stop
the questions about the wuhan lab unless
they were guilty of something themselves
unless they were guilty of something
themselves why
else would they do it right
well let me ask you this let me give you
a hypothetical and this might
this might help you a little bit let's
say you're married
and you're going to go golfing
and one member of the foursome that
you're going to go with
happens to be the brother of your
ex-girlfriend
would you want your wife to be asking a
lot of questions
about your golf game and if you said
yeah i just went we golfed and just had
to force him
it was a good time and you didn't
mention
that one of the foursome was the brother
of your ex-girlfriend and then your wife
finds out
wait a minute you golfed with the
brother
of your ex-girlfriend well now there's a
fight
right is that because you're getting
closer to her were you trying to find
out some more about her because you're
interested
in the real world the fact that you're
guilty or innocent
has nothing to do with whether you want
people to look into your
right take your phone
your you live a completely clean life
everything that you've ever done since
your marriage and
and before is clean and you're conscious
free
there's nothing on your phone no
flirting no messages no
no no no anything hand it to your spouse
and say spouse i'm totally free of any
guilt just take a look through my phone
go ahead will your spouse find
something to be really mad at you about
remember there's nothing on your phone
incriminating nothing
what will your spouse find well you'll
be divorced in about an hour
you'll be divorced because your spouse
will find plenty of things that you
thought were innocent
and were but look pretty sketchy
if you're looking at it out of context
right pretty sketchy
so in the real world you should try like
hell
not to get people to look into your
no matter if you're guilty or not
it's the most basic hygiene of safety
you could ever
practice don't look into my
unless you've got a warrant right
so um what do you make of the fact that
there were
americans who were also pushing
to not look into the lab as the main
cause of the
thing to me that's just normal dilbert
behavior
it doesn't mean they knew they were
guilty
it could mean that i'm not ruling it out
i'm just saying it could go either way
and you would always get the same result
they would always resist that
and should next here's the other
dilberty filter
find a scapegoat everybody wants a
scapegoat right
dr fauci he'll be our scapegoat
or china china will be our scapegoat
or trump mean old orange man he'll be
our
scapegoat but we need scapegoats
it's the most dilberty thing you can do
it doesn't matter what happened or who
did what
we just need to find who's to blame
blame
do you think it'll make any difference
if we confirm
that china knew it came from the lab and
it did
what difference will that make seriously
we're not going to change our security
protocols in any way
because we already suspect it could have
come from there
or if even if it didn't come from there
we're still going to beef up security
because of the worry
so it won't have any it would have no
effect on security
because presumably we're already doing
everything we can to increase that
um china is not going to admit
culpability
so it's just going to be hey you did
this look at all our proof
and then china's saying hey you made
that up no
we didn't make it up look here's all our
evidence here's the here's the video
here's the
here's the scientist talking about it
here's our 15 witnesses
it's proof nobody could doubt this
absolute total proof here you go
what would china say nope nope no that's
that's not real
there's nothing you can do with the
knowledge we are chasing knowledge
with no use it doesn't have a
it doesn't have a function you think it
does
but i don't think it does it just feels
like you should
matter but it doesn't it doesn't
because i agree with fauci when he says
there's no way anybody did this
intentionally it just wouldn't be a
rational act
all right um
what are other reasons in a dilbert
filter
oh here here's another here's another
one um
did you note that it was only maybe 48
hours ago
that we were saying that fauci was lying
stouchy lied about x fauci
lied about why fauci lied about this
but already it's starting to soften
so now we're going from him lying to at
least in this
one one situation to underplaying
he's not lying about the wuhan lab
being a potential source of the leak no
he wasn't
lying about it because he didn't tell a
direct lie
he only underplayed it he underplayed it
who gets to decide what is underplayed
do you is there some international
standard
for what is underplayed versus what is
played just right
versus what is overplayed see the
difference
if something is a lie you can debunk it
or confirm it if i say this is a lie
you can fact check it but can you fact
check
underplayed you see the trick
we went from something that could
potentially be proven or not
to something that's pure opinion i think
you should have said more words around
this
i'm not sure he should have here's why
so here are some uh dilberty reasons
uh to not immediately look into the
wuhan lab
now i think we should so i'm saying
these are the dilver reasons not good
reasons
one is that it might stop all gain of
function
and maybe related research there has to
be a reason
that a lab does gain a function stuff
there are two reasons one would be to
weaponize it
which we don't have a confirmation
anybody did and if we did i wouldn't
believe it
but we certainly have uh the experts
saying that the other reason you do gain
a function
is to prevent an outbreak the point of
gain of function
the whole point is to avoid a pandemic
now it may have caused one that's
possible
but it doesn't change the fact that the
point of it was to make us smarter and
better prepared
so if you were a reasonable person who
cared about the world
might you try to discourage people from
looking into the wuhan lab as the source
just because it might have a dampening
effect on other research
that's essential it's a tough one isn't
it
because you might find that the most
moral position you could take on this is
to lie
it's not impossible it could be that the
most
moral position would be to lie about it
and just downplay it
because you don't want this other
research which is essential
to be just killed at the same time just
because people can't abide by this kind
of stuff
that wouldn't be a bad reason i'm not
saying it was the reason
i'm saying if if anybody thought that
way it would be reasonable
you can make your own decision about
what is moral or ethical
um fauci also said directly
i believe he said this that accusing
china
before we had some kind of solid
evidence we had less evidence then that
it would make them less compliant with
our requests is that fair
do you think china would respond
differently
to an aggressive accusatory approach
versus something more moderate
i don't know you know china might just
do what's good for china
no matter what but it's not
crazy to think that we would get a
little less
participation from them if we were mean
to
them so that's not crazy it's just hard
it's but it's subjective right
how about uh the fact that uh
looking into the wuhan lab would at
least highlight the fact that americans
are funding
some gain of function stuff that's going
to look really dicey
and even if the reason we were doing
gain of function funding
was to make vaccinations and to avoid
pandemics
it's not going to look like that is it
so
in the real world you do avoid it
telling people the truth
when the truth looks worse and more
misleading
than a lie that's the real world
sometimes the truth is the most
dangerous thing you can put out there
that's just the fact
right you could argue that you want it
anyway
you could argue you'd rather take the
danger to get the honesty i'd listen to
that argument
but it's a fact that lying to the public
sometimes has utility that's why it
happens
it's one of the reasons it happens so
there were good reasons
for people to push back against the
lab leak story which had nothing to do
with whether it was true
sort of a cover your ass cover your
other funding
make sure it doesn't come into your
backyard you know make sure
we don't get blamed for the wrong thing
those are all those are all reasonable
reasons
all right i have the most provocative uh
probably get me cancelled
topic of the day and it's based on this
so the rioters in
minneapolis we're smashing windows and
looting
at some scale i don't think it was the
biggest thing in the world and it's
because there was a suspect
who was already accused in a homicide
and he was stopped
and i guess he wasn't supposed to have a
firearm
but he had one he brandished it he was
shot in his car
by law enforcement now of course he was
black
so that sparked these riots now you
might say to yourself
but wait a minute this is exactly the
opposite of george floyd
this is a known or at least accused
murderer
who had a gun and brandished it during a
traffic stop this is nothing like
anything else yeah somebody says good
riddance here
yes i join you in saying i have no
sympathy for anybody who resists arrest
um but here's my question would this be
racist i need a ruling
give me a ruling and i'll start with
this context
it would definitely be racist if you
decided to move
because there were too many black people
in your neighborhood
can we agree on that that if you just
said ah there's a lot a lot of black
people in my neighborhood let's say
you're not black
and you you decided to move just because
there were two
too many black people in your
neighborhood according to you is that
racist yes
yes that's about as racist as you could
get i would think
right i see somebody say no okay but i'm
gonna get to your point
hold on hold on so i think it would be
racist if you just said i don't like
being around
any ethnicity and then he moved but how
about this
suppose you said to yourself that in our
current fake news
politicized world that the fake news is
riling up a certain population to be
more disruptive than they would normally
be in other words it has nothing to do
with the ethnicity
it has a lot to do with the fake news
targeting a group
and getting one group all worked up
against another group
under those conditions if you were a
white person deciding where to move to
or even where to move out of could you
use
the density of the black population as
one of your criteria
without being racist go
could you because on the surface it
sounds racist as hell right
but if the context is nothing about the
individuals
and this wouldn't be this would not be
it wouldn't be anything about the
individuals which would be totally
racist
it's about the fake news and the fake
news
weaponizing part of the public against
the other part
do you want to be somewhere where the
people who living
who live in walking distance are
weaponized
against you i say no
i say that in 2021 and this would not
have been true
in the past but in 2021 because of this
special case
of the fake news weaponizing the public
against each other
i think it's a fair it's a fair variable
and i think that their people are going
to say you know i just don't want to
live next to a black
population center because even if they
haven't
been radicalized yet it looks like it's
going to happen
because the fake news is relentless
right
so yeah it's going to be a judgment call
but i'll put that out there we'll see if
i get
cancelled for that a funny story of the
day that you could
interpret in any way you want but
apparently hunter biden is moving
from his 5.4 million dollar rental home
in venice beach
um which appears to be overrun by the
homeless
now not his home per se but the place he
lives
is overrun by the homeless is that the
reason he's moving
is it possible and the story doesn't
make this connection
because he could be moving for any
reason right he could be moving just
because he got a better home
which seems more likely but the
implication here is that he would want
to move out of this place
because it was overrun by the homeless
why were there so many so many homeless
there
that weren't always there would it be
democrat policies
is it possible that the president's son
had to move
out of a place that had too many
democrat policies
or was it too much access to drugs
that's a possibility too right
too much access to drugs because you
know
no joke you know we can all be critics
of you know the bidens etc politically
but there's one thing i will not be
i refuse to be a critic of which is
hunter biden's drug addiction
drug addiction is a medical problem
right i know you want it to be about
your character
you want it to be about
you know being weak willed you want it
to be all those things
but it's not it's a medical problem
and yeah i see the disagreements so i
i'm conscious of your disagreement on
this
but in my opinion that's the one thing
that i'm not going to give him a hard
time for
i just wish him well in terms of his
health
here's something i did not see coming
reparations apparently is happening
and it's working working in the sense
that
it's happening not working in the sense
that you necessarily like it
if you look at the defunding the police
that's kind of reparations because it
allows more crime without punishment
in a place where you have a large black
population
and so you'd have fewer people
presumably going to prison
so that's good although they may have
committed crimes so if you're the victim
that's bad
but also i would imagine shoplifting
and looting or through the roof and
and at least one member of black lives
matter i believe
has defended that as reparations so if i
said to you
reparations would be going along
strongly in 2021 how many of you thought
that would happen
it's actually happening and now we see
that the agricultural secretary
wants to make unequal uh grants to
farmers who are black to give them more
money
than if you're a white farmer now the
reason for this is historical
discrimination is it true that there was
historical discrimination against
black farmers i don't know
but i would think so right i mean you
don't have to
stretch your imagination to imagine it
was probably terrible
like everything else during that that
year and up to the few
up to the current so yeah probably
um so whether or not you think it's a
good idea or a bad idea
i'm making the point that is happening
it's reparations so
um so in a bunch of different ways
reparations are actually happening
now i don't think that they're being
done in a way that
makes me happy you know it seems like
you could be done a better way
in a way that helps all poor people
specifically but uh it's actually
happening
i i i'm actually surprised in terms of
my own predictions i'm going to mark
this one as a failure
because i didn't see all the side doors
i i kind of imagined
reparations as we're going to mail you a
check and i thought well there's no way
that's going to happen
right but they don't have to mail a
check they can just
you know carve along the edges and get
there
here's a new story i tried to look at a
story in the news and the news
was referring to a facebook video
and so i started to click on the
facebook video
but i couldn't because duckduckgo
which i've been using as my browser told
me that
if i clicked on it which i could
actually i could click on it but it gave
me a warning
and it said that if i click on it i
would go to facebook and they track me
and if i didn't want to be tracked don't
click on this link
so how great is that
right again i didn't see this coming
but in a world in which facebook can
block trump
and our social media platforms can block
people talking about ivermectin
can block talking about
hydroxychloroquine which by the way i
i don't have an opinion about whether
those work
and they can block the election fraud
claims
so the social media companies can be the
deciders
of what to block why doesn't that work
the other way
is there any reason you can't get a
browser extension or just a browser
that would work the way duckduckgo has
worked in this case which would block
you
from seeing harmful things on the social
media platforms
according to your own requirements
here's what i'd like to see
i'd love to see your browser or
extension which gave me a checklist
of what things are lies and i can decide
which ones are lies
because there's no credible source to
tell you what's a lie or what isn't
you have to decide on yourself could you
start blocking
videos that appear on facebook and other
social
platforms because those platforms
are not trusted it's kind of interesting
isn't it because what is the response
to the social plot social media
platforms having so much control over
you
one possibility is that the public will
use one platform to block the other
and they'll use each platform to block
the other
it could be they're all being used to
block everything until
everything is blocked that's considered
a lie
and almost everything is considered a
lie by somebody
so where does this end up
all right i just thought it was fun that
i got blocked from
facebook instead of being blocked by
facebook that's maybe
baby is healthy here's another story
where the headline doesn't match the
story this is a cnn example
surprise um and here's what the
the headline said now this is the
headline as you would click it on their
website
to get to the story so on the front page
it says this
observers find massive security problems
with arizona
audit now if you saw the headline on cnn
observers find massive security problems
with arizona audit
what do you expect that the story would
include
massive security problems with the
arizona audit
well here are the details once you find
them you have to sort of dig down to get
the details
one person had a cell phone inside the
audit it was one of the people in charge
so one person had a cell phone
so that's a major problem i guess
some people had black and blue pens
which is a problem because then they
could fraudulently mark ballots
but it's also all on video right like
everything that's happening
during the audit is on video if somebody
picked up one of those black or blue
plans and started marking ballots
i think it's right there on video
then the other major problem was there
was one door unattended
one unattended door okay
and then also some observers or the
observers were made to wear
pink shirts which caused them to be
teased
by other and mocked by other people
there
so those were your those were your
massive security problems
those are massive that's it
headline does not match the article
here's a scary thought to the news is
telling us today that
people who are who are on immuno
immunosuppressants
which apparently could be 60 million
americans
it doesn't it makes the vaccination not
work
what 60 million americans
might have a vaccination that didn't
work at all
and when i say didn't work the suspicion
is
worked zero as in didn't give you any
immunity
as in no immunity could be detected
after you got the vaccination
now so far it's anecdotal meaning that
there's not a
big study proving it there are some
anecdotes
but oh my god if this is true
oh my god
and here's my question which i didn't
see in the story if
if these immunosuppressants make
the vaccine not work could they make you
more susceptible to covet itself
or is it just unrelated okay so that
there's my
my question of the day would the
immunosuppressants make
an individual more likely to die from
covet feels like it would right
feels like it would so if america had 60
million people on
immunosuppressants how many of them
are the ones that died because i didn't
even hear this being part of a
co-morbidity
unless unless the reason you have an
immunosuppressant is because you have a
comorbidity and that was on the list
but i don't think so i don't remember
seeing it in the top five
whatever you whatever it is that you
take these drugs for
so this is potentially a gigantic
problem but i think
this is a wait and see we'll see if it
is now i've told you before that our
our opinions on politics are assigned to
us
we think we're making up our own minds
but not even close
you're definitely getting an assigned
opinion and you can see this when
there's a question that doesn't have
much of a political element to it
but we forced the politics onto it
now the the pandemic did that a lot why
in the world
would there be different opinions on a
pandemic
that would line up by political party
does that make any sense
in what world does pandemic
science information correct or incorrect
in what world is that political
well in a world in which your opinions
are assigned to you not
not in a world in which you make up your
own mind but we don't live in that world
so here's uh rasmussen uh
who did some questions that really point
this out
uh here one question was was the january
6 riot at the capitol
the worst attack on our democracy since
the civil war
76 percent of democrats said yes
26 of uh republicans said yes
weren't we watching the same news it's
all the same news right
we watched the same news
everybody has access to the same
information
so why is it 76
of democrats but only 26 percent of gop
and i've told you that you can get a
quarter of the people to say any damn
thing
so saying that a quarter of the people
believe x means
no people believe x except people who
didn't understand the question or
something
so once you get down to 25 percent
that's like zero
because they're the ones not paying
attention um
this could not be more clear it could
not be more clear
that these opinions were assigned these
are assigned opinions these are not
independent opinions
here's another one where the summer of
2020 disturbances in the u.s mostly
peaceful protests or riots
69 percent of republicans say riots only
32 percent of democrats say riots
or are we watching the same news why is
a riot
political if a store burns down it
burned down
it's not republican fire or democrat
fire
there should be nothing there should be
absolutely
nothing political in these stories and
yet
because our opinions are assigned to us
it's hyper-political
hyper-political now is this convincing
to you
because we're you're also in the
category of somebody who got an assigned
opinion
but can you see it i'm interested
because the comments are a little
ambiguous right now
watching your comments can you see this
is it obvious to you
that humans are not making up their own
opinions on stuff like this
i'm just interested if you can see it or
it feels like
hyperbole to you
all right i'm seeing some yeses so you
can see it but you don't think it
happened to you right
it feels like this is just something
happening to democrats
until you realize it's happening to you
you're not really free you you don't get
to go to the next level
here's how you can be at least a little
bit
no i wouldn't say confident but a little
bit safer
that you have something closer to an
independent opinion
and that would be do you sometimes
disagree
with your own party on something where
is there any situation where 75
of the people in your political party
say one thing and you disagree with them
if there are a few of those examples you
might not be
having your opinion assigned to you you
might be actually coming up with your
own opinions
i think those people exist but they're
by far
rare
all right so if you haven't disagreed
with your own team
you're probably just having to sign
opinions and there's nothing else to say
about it
so there's a new force of evil in the
world uh just about the most
evil thing i've seen since the lincoln
project
it's a new pack it's called the strike
back
it looks like their deal is to make
anti-republican commercials
and they did one that says retweet
retweet if you're sick and tired of the
gop
assault on democracy and are ready to
fight back
and that's filled with misleading
imagery
equating the capital protests with
literal nazis and hitler but the worst
part the part that just made me
like fly into a rage
was they take out of context
laura ingraham and graham i never can
pronounce your name right i apologize
um because because i think laura watches
the show sometimes so i apologize
for some reason there are some kinds of
names that no matter how many times i
hear them
like my brain can't process them so it
has nothing to do with
anybody personally there's just some
names i can't handle i don't know why
but um they showed a picture of her
and i'm not going to do an impression of
it but she was extending an arm
and it looked like she was just waving
to the crowd on some stage event where
she was on stage
and they they interspersed her
with her extended arm with nazi imagery
and when you see them trying to make the
case very strongly they were making the
case that republicans are basically just
nazis
with no you know there's no subtlety to
it
republicans are nazis that's the whole
deal
and i say to myself why does twitter
allow that
because that's the most hate speech
you'll ever see
that literally a group of people are
nazis
now do the social networks have some
kind of a exception for nazi
illusions or comparisons
because it seems to me that anything
that was somewhat
this bad would be banned
in any other context this would be
banned
why is it okay to call the gop nazis
but they can't question the legitimacy
of an election
they can't talk about other medical
hypotheses just because they're unproven
they can't but you can do you can run
this on twitter
comparing uh people to nazis
who just don't have just aren't
uh
so richard who i'll call dick
scott has no readability he said trump
did not mock
a crippled man well dick
let me tell you dick uh you've never
seen the compilation
videos that show that trump uses that
same
mocking impression for lots of different
people
were you aware of that dick
dick did you know that almost everybody
who's watching this except you
for some reason dick you're the only
person who hasn't seen the compilation
video where he commonly uses that
gesture
you're the only one and the problem is
that i have a readability problem
that that's why you concluded because
you're ignorance
because your opinion was assigned to you
by
 and you just adopted it oh i
think that's true
some told me that's true i
guess it's true
so dick
um i would ban you but it's too much
work to go find your comment
so but thank you for the entertainment
dick
um is it just a coincidence that all the
people who
who are by trolls named richard that's
weird
there's a story about jake tapper of cnn
he says he
won't book anyone on his show who has
pushed
the quote big lie about election fraud
to which many people asked including me
is that a standard you're willing to
use on everything because
shouldn't you then ban people who told
other big lies
is there only one big lie that matters
there were no
other big lies can you think of anything
anything in the last several years that
cnn has said
that's not true
well they did say that the president
called neo-nazis in charlottesville
fine people over and over again
and we know that didn't happen it was a
rupaur video that made it look like it
did
we know that cnn has said that the
president suggested drinking bleach
and we know that didn't happen because
again that was a rupaur video not a real
one
they took out the context um
what about the koi fish hoax what about
the russia collusion hoax
where do you draw the line where do you
draw the line
how could you have the standard that
liars can't be on the show
if you have the standard that liars
can't be on the show
it's just an empty set there's nothing
but liars
on tv i mean there's just nothing about
liars
so it's a weird standing standard and it
takes a lot of guts
i mean you have to have guts to say that
out loud
or you have to think it's true which
would be something else
no thanks okay
my devices just talk to me sometimes um
how about this apparently in london
this is one of the best ideas you want
to hear a good idea
and one that could change the world have
you ever worried about fake news
of course you have and what it's doing
to us
it turns out that there's a solution to
fake news
potentially i don't want to get ahead of
myself
but there might be a solution and it's
not fact-checking
and i'll tell you this story and then
we'll tie it into the fake news
a london-based people's tribute tribunal
so in other words there's no government
involvement this is just people who
organized
and they're organizing a public trial
or a tribunal i guess called the uyghur
tribunal
there's no state backing and any
judgment they make would not be binding
on anybody
but they'll basically have a public
trial
on whether china is committing genocide
with the uyghurs you see where i'm going
with this
the only way i can imagine we will ever
get past
fake news is to have public trials
for facts have a public trial
on any anything that's in the news
that's accused of being a hoax let's
have a trial
let's have both sides show their should
make their case
we're putting on trial this fact
and now individuals can organize
and they could turn it into
entertainment
would you watch a youtube channel
in which you saw major questions put on
trial
and they made it nice and tight and
entertaining so it doesn't you know drag
on for days and years like a real trial
but it's just tight and it gives both
sides
and there's some back and forth and
there's some kind of a judge
let's say a moderator judge who is more
of a judge judy
like a badass i just said no that's not
true or
nope if you don't have a link or a
source for that it's not admitted
just somebody you know really staying on
top of the people because right now the
model is
a tv host lets two people who disagree
talk and make lies until time runs out
right good how good is that they can
talk until time runs out and you don't
know who is right nobody checks their
sources
nothing that's our current model it
seems to me the only way
around the stranglehold that the fake
news
organizations have is for the people to
self-organize
and self-organize around topics so for
example if somebody wanted to do the
topic of is
israel a an apartheid state or
just defending themselves and just
organize it put it out there make it
content i'd buy it
you know keep it tight maybe you want to
keep it 45 minutes
no longer because that's all it would
take but
well somebody said i should do it but
i'm thinking now it should be organized
by topic
rather than a person organizing a bunch
of them because i don't know that
anybody cares enough
to organize a bunch of stuff but you
might find somebody who cares enough to
organize about a topic like the uyghurs
so i'm going to be watching this this
uyghur tribunal
to see if this is maybe a model to beat
the fake news
um do you remember speaking of experts
here's an expert opinion i haven't heard
criticized yet do you remember early on
in the pandemic
when trump said we're going to work on a
vaccination
what did all the smart people say didn't
all the smart people say first of all
it would take you know too long but
there's another thing the smart people
said
and they all said it and i have to admit
i was fooled by it so i'm going to admit
i was wrong about this
those of you who say scott you never
admit when you're wrong
well here's one okay so add this to your
list
of something i'm telling you i got wrong
so the next time you come and say give
that back so you never saw you're wrong
the list is growing because everybody
gets stuff wrong right
like i would never claim i don't get
things wrong i get
plenty of stuff wrong i'm just trying to
get more right than wrong that's the
best you can do
but here's the thing in the beginning
the experts said
we've never made a coronavirus
vaccination that worked
and therefore there's probably a reason
we probably don't know how
and probably can't make a coronavirus
vaccination that works we can make other
kinds of vaccinations work
do you remember that that was considered
common knowledge
and so the experts were telling us we
couldn't do this
at the same time it was that literally
being done right
now obviously modernity didn't say this
so the people who knew how to do it
knew they could do it apparently or had
a strong suspicion
so um i believed that when i heard it
and i
bought into that and although i thought
i did predict
that our therapeutics and our science
would rise to the challenge i did not
believe
that the vaccinations would be the magic
bullet
so if you're if you're predicting you
know who got that prediction right
i got that one wrong so add that to my
wrong list
but here's some freaking incredible news
do you like good news with your coffee
sure you do sure you do i hear somebody
say therapeutics is a better
better answer you know
it's still an open question whether we
had the therapeutics that's all i can
say without getting banned
i don't want to be banned by social
media so i'll just say
it's still an open question whether i
was right-ish
that a therapeutic would be the big
answer
it could have been we just don't know
i'd say it's an open question
but the golden age is coming not only
with nuclear energy as i mentioned
but did you know that this mrna
vaccination stuff has way more potential
than just the coronavirus how many of
you knew that
that we're on the cusp of something
really big
really really big here's an example keep
in mind
that the people who are telling you this
what i'm going to tell you
the same people who are telling you this
told you
they could make a coronavirus
vaccination
in six months or whatever it took
moderna
moderna told you they could make a
vaccination
that nobody's ever made before for a
coronavirus
and they did it okay so these are
credible people
they're also trying to do a vaccination
with the
with the same platform of technology to
target enough
number of other uh problems including
and and this is already happening right
so this is in the pipeline this is not
hypothetical
it's happening now they're using this
technology to come up with
vaccinations against hiv
nepa whatever that is nipah
zika herpes
deng deng fever hepatitis
and malaria those are just the ones who
are announced
that's not even just the ones they might
be able to do those are just the ones
they announced
and apparently what's so special about
this mrna
platform if i can call it that is that
it is
designed specifically that once you get
it working
you can quickly make vaccinations now
could it be the end of humankind because
the technology is bad and kills us
all yeah i suppose so it's always
possible
but i i feel as though
this field is going to be just gigantic
just gigantic
and we we may have through completely
just completely inadvertently this might
be one of the greatest boons to humanity
of all time
meaning the coronavirus that nobody
wanted
might be the best thing that ever
happened to humanity
isn't that weird it could be the best
thing that ever happened
because the number of people that would
be saved by
you turning this technology into a
common platform
to solve other problems it's
incalculable
i mean you were talking millions and
millions and millions
uh i've been asked to rate nick fuente's
persuasion skills high very high
now nick fuentes is very controversial
uh
i'm i'm not going to be the one to uh uh
to endorse anything he says that's for
him you know he he can defend himself
and then
as much as he wants but on the on the
narrow question of whether he's capable
yes yes he is and
he's very capable so if you think that
he's a bad force in the world you should
be afraid
because he's very capable and if you
think he's entertaining and useful
well good for you all right
that is my
live stream for today i dare say it was
one of the best of all times um
and now i'm going to go do some other
things and
oh catherine is asking how i'm feeling
yeah so an update i got my second
vaccination
uh the moderna the the the 24 hours
after it were
rugged you know it was pretty
uncomfortable i will say
for about 24 hours but when it was over
here's the weird thing
other people have said this that you can
feel like your whole body
is fighting something or evolving or
something you actually feel like your
whole body is involved
it doesn't it doesn't just feel like
there's a part of your body or something
you feel like your whole body
has something new in it like i had goose
bumps all day
and you really there's something
happening right
it's definitely not a placebo i can tell
you that
well i guess i wouldn't know but
here's the fun part the second day
when i woke up 100 percent better
but and here's the part i'm wondering
about and let me ask this question
for those of you who got the modern shot
the madurana shot you've had the second
shot
and you also had a little discomfort or
you had a bad day after
how many of you had the following
experience
that when it went away maybe when you
woke up it was 100 go on
all the symptoms and you felt
great see that's the part i didn't see
coming
i didn't just feel a lack of symptoms
i felt great like great
i didn't have a stiffness anywhere in my
body
i exercised more than i have in a long
time
it was great and i can't tell
i can't tell if it's only just because i
felt so bad the other day
that it was the contrast so that's why
i'm asking the question
how many of you felt great after the
symptoms were away like way beyond
normal grade
and a number of you are saying yes i
said somebody says it was the
marijuana no that's every day so i
couldn't tell the difference
um somebody says
felt great somebody said that's crazy
uh felt no symptoms psychological
might be perfectly possible
i felt relieved somebody says okay yeah
it's probably just contrast
so it may just be that you know my brain
was relieved and my body was relieved
and that's all so we won't we will not
assume that that is a common experience
but it was my experience
and man do i feel good now
uh sparky had no noticeable effects from
the modernity shot
well i hope you're not taking any
immunosuppressants
and that is all i've got now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
