good morning everybody
are you ready
for the best show in the history of
human civilization
and possibly one or two alien
civilizations who tried and failed
before we evolved
and who knows how many after that all i
know is this is the highlight of the
entire
i know big bang until now
and if you'd like to take it up another
notch i know i know it seems impossible
but it can be done and we're going to do
it today
and you will start your day
with a success
and that will probably you know snowball
into all kinds of good things happening
to you today and by the way
again i don't think i say this often
enough
i don't know are you working out or
something
because you look sexier than normal
and uh
if you'd like to take that up a notch
too all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tank or shelves to design a
canteen joke or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's a dopamine here of the day
it's the thing that makes you tinkle
it's called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
those on the locals platform note that i
was just modeling a technique that i've
been describing to them
they learn so much there so much more
than you learn on youtube but yet i love
you all
so in the news uh the world health
organization
who
i just told you
the world health organization
who
i just told you
is says they want to rename a monkey box
why
why would they want to rename monkey box
the first thing we have to acknowledge
and i think you'd all agree
there has never been a better name for a
serious disease than monkey pox
i don't care
who you are
you hear monkey pox and you think
monkey box am i right
but you hear
you're going to get a bad case of kovan
19 that might have come out of some kind
of weapons laboratory
we don't know but we worry that it might
have
now that's scary stuff
although
as bad as saying you have coven 19
sounds
ironically
saying you have long covet
sounds a little bit
self-complementary if you know what i
mean
i don't like to brag but
you got a i got a pretty big case a long
covered
long cubit
my coverage is so long
so
monkey box
um tragically it looks like they're
going to change the name so we won't
have the fun of calling it monkey pox
anymore with all the jokes that you can
make about that and of course the reason
is obvious it's obvious
is racist
now here's a question i ask
provocatively
if you and i heard monkey pox and
thought of monkeys and thought it was
funny and it was a good name
and that's all we thought
because we're good people but if some
other people maybe the people in the
world health organization and a bunch of
people who
uh wrote to ask for this there was some
kind of a
some kind of a sign up where people
signed the letter and said you got to
change that name from monkey box because
it sounded racist to them
to which i say to myself
huh
who is the racist in this story
if i put the variables together
the people who
just think monkeys are cute
uh
or is it the people who made some other
association
with cute little monkeys
to which i say i think we found
we found the racists
or they found us
or something
but uh if you'd like to contribute to
the renaming of monkeybox
i think it's a fertile
fertile grounds for humor
so can somebody uh maybe start a tweet
thread
i should have done it myself
of a
cracker box
on the locals platform
somebody suggested renaming it to
cracker pox
i think we can close the competition i
think cracker pox just won
oh my god
that is funny
you know and it's funny because of the
actual sound of the letters
one of the reasons that monkey is funny
is because of the k sound
right we put a k sound in anything that
just sounds funnier
uh but cracker has that same thing going
for it
cracker pox
and even pox even pox is a funny word a
pox on your house
all right um
does it seem to you
that
uh
that maybe losing is winning these days
or something
there's there's something going on with
the democrats it's almost as if
they're trying to play for
a better draft pick next season
and somebody needs to explain to him it
doesn't work that way
because you know how if a sports team is
looks like they can't make the playoffs
well maybe they don't try so hard after
that point because it would be better to
end the season in a low rank
because then you go to the top of the
heap
for picking the new talent out of the
draft next time so you could actually
leapfrog
you know and turn into a dynasty pretty
quickly if you get the right players
so but it almost feels as if the
democrats are like playing for a draft
pick and somebody needs to tell them
you know
it doesn't really work that way
um
and
listen to what the democrats are up
against in terms of a headwind
for the coming elections
all right rasmussen says
rasmussen poll 89 of voters are at least
somewhat concerned about the economy
89
how does any incumbent
win reelection what 89
are worried about the economy it doesn't
even matter if it's the fault of the
president
because remember the rules are
the president gets credit even if they
didn't do anything
and the credit and the president gets
you know criticized even if there wasn't
anything they could do or even if they
didn't do anything wrong
so
if you've got 89 percent of the voters
at least somewhat concerned about the
economy including 69 percent who are
very concerned that's not looking good
for the incumbent
and then
secondly
crime is the only issue that rivals
economic concerns with voters this is
also from rasmussen
88
are concerned about violent crime
including 64 who are very concerned
now
the economy and crime
what are the
what are the two things that are most
associated with the republicans
that they even democrats would say well
you know we we hate these republicans
but
you know in a quiet moment if nobody is
overhearing me and i'm talking to my
best friend who won't tell anybody i
might admit
that they might do better on economics
and crimes
at least some people would have that
view
so you know it's hard to imagine how
democrats could win and so this predicts
that the only strategy that they could
have they democrats
election strategy would be coming up
with bigger and bigger hoaxes
and unfortunately
that's like real
isn't it
because it doesn't seem that the actual
facts even the facts the cnn is willing
to report because remember even cnn
uh has decided to become more
even-handed
and apparently to their credit and i
will say this publicly because i
criticized them
mercilessly
but to their credit
they had a fairly
prominent prime time
question about biden's competency you
know don lemon grilled him hard on that
and
i think the public would appreciate that
that that was a that was a pretty
meaningful way to approach
an important question so give them
credit for that but how in the world do
the
democrats win unless they come up with
the world's biggest hoax
and i think that the january sixth thing
is is there at least how they're going
to frame things
and i think the idea is that if they can
so this is sort of democrat math but
maybe it's just political math i don't
blame democrats
if you can say that there's one person
in a group of 10
who did something
despicable
you can say that that group is bad
am i right
if one person in a larger group of 10
does something terrible
it's our normal thing to say well that's
a bad group
because at the very least they allowed
somebody in that group who would do that
terrible thing so even if you say well
it was only one person who did the
terrible thing
it's a reasonable argument to say but
you know the other nine maybe you should
have seen that come in or should have
stayed away from them whatever
but now let's say you successfully make
the argument and now you've demonized
the ten
but what if the ten
are a small group
of another larger group
does it work again
and the answer is yes it does once
you've said that the group of 10 are all
bad
by extension
then if they're part of a yet another
larger group you could say well
that larger group is letting these guys
in
so
logically by association at least they
should have policed themselves better
and so i look at the january 6th thing
so the january 6th thing is
a small number of people
probably in the
proud boys and others
probably did some really bad things not
probably there was actual violence and
injury so people did some bad violent
things
but probably not most of them
but you still say but wait okay
if the proud boys had you know this many
people in them who were willing to fight
and cause trouble
that does say something about the larger
group even if the larger group
90 percent of them had nothing to do
with anything illegal
right
so you start with the the small trouble
keep troublemakers and you extend that
to the proud boys
but then you say
the proud boys were
a few hundred
or at least people like them you know if
you include like-minded people
and of a
number of several thousand so now you
can say wait a minute
if there are a few people in the proud
boys who were bad
you know unambiguously bad
now you've demonized the proud boys so
you've got that whole group but now you
say but the proud boys
were a significant chunk
of the entire protest
whatever you want to call significant
kind of subjective
and now you can demonize the entire
protest
so now you've now you've uh you've done
two leaps right
one is the few protesters to the proud
boys and i'll just use the proud boys as
a proxy for the the people who came
there with the worst intentions you know
they they were thinking fighting when
they went there and then you say you
extend that to the people who were
let's just say
enthusiastic trump supporters but they
were nothing like the proud boys
right they didn't
many of them might not even know they
existed
so now you've demonized all the people
at the protest
and then you can extend that now to
trump
because you could say well
you know maybe it's hard to prove in any
legal sense
that trump directly told anybody to do
anything illegal
or even
unwise
but we can certainly show that he didn't
do enough to stop it as soon as he could
so now you've extended
the larger crowd
to trump
and now that you've got it to trump
you can extend it to maga
the ultra magus
so now you've got it all the way to
trump and mega
and then mega of course makes up much of
the republicans and and the right and
conservatives
so now you've you've done
how many leaps was that four
four leaps so you started with a small
group of you know violent people
then that demonized the proud boys and
like-minded people
and then that got all the protesters
no matter what reasons they were there
or no matter what they did or no matter
what their intentions were
and then that got
trump's orbit and then that got all
omega and then that gets all of
republicans and then that's all of
conservatives
right in front of our eyes
you know it's not like it's not like
it's a magic trick
they're doing it right in front of us
and yeah we'll talk about the fbi in a
minute
so
um
now do blm and antifa
same same political math yeah so earlier
when i said
um
when i was saying that it's not just a
democrat math it's political math that
would be a good example so you could do
the same thing with there there were
some number of people who are violent in
the black lives matter protests
they're all democrats blah blah blah so
it scales up the same way but the
january 6th thing that has i think has
more jumps
we're used to two jumps right
but the january 16 is like a four jump
play
all right um speaking of hoaxes
so now the biden administration is going
to look into some kind of administrative
punishment for the
border patrol who allegedly were
whipping
haitians
crossing the border of the
mexican border
and
of course it turns out that
the photographic evidence completely
clears them it was just a misleading
video and they were just using the reins
on their own horse
but instead of just saying well we're
sorry
didn't i i guess we were fooled by those
misleading videos go back to work and
you know with our blessings they're
actually going to pretend like they were
right all along
because demonizing the border patrol is
good for their politics
this is like one of the worst things
i've ever seen
and
at what point do you do you stop
ignoring it
you know as a public
because every time i see a story like
this it makes my blood boil i'm like oh
are they really gonna
punish these guys
the border patrol people
who apparently did nothing
wrong
are they really going to punish them
just for consistency and political gain
and do it right in front of us
right in front of us
is that really happening
and so so here's the thought process i
go through
i think well i've got to do something
about this
but then the very very next story i read
i think well i've got to do something
about that too
there are too many things to do stuff
about
they they've basically overwhelmed me
with outrage
so i have so many outrages i'm like you
know i should like weigh in and
make sure that these border patrol
people because they're they're employees
of the united states right
so in a way public employees are
sort of my responsibility aren't they
you know in an extended way
i pay taxes the taxes go to their you
know they're working for the public i'm
the public i mean i feel like it's a
two-way obligation right they're keeping
us safe
don't i have the same obligation to them
to keep them safe so i read this story
i'm like oh
it's their job to keep me safe they're
not safe themselves
i should run down there and like keep
them safe
it's just
you know a reciprocal instinct kind of
thing
but then who has the time and i think
well
other people got problems too and maybe
i could solve a problem that's closer to
home and
you know you talk yourself out of it
but
and it could be it could be that if you
looked into it you'd find out there's
more to it than you know
and then you spend all your time trying
to
fix this outrage
only to find out that a few of the
border patrol that they're talking about
actually did something wrong
and then you you've wasted all your
outrage on something you just didn't
have the full context to so it's easy to
talk yourself out of work you know
working against any of these outrages
because maybe they're not even true
um
so what is the worst thing about having
a job with coworkers
it's the co-workers it's the meetings
because then there are more co-workers
there at the same time
you know there's the only thing worse
the worst thing at work is interacting
with other people right
all of the unpleasantness at work is
interacting with your boss
or interacting with your co-workers
generally the customers are fine
you know you can usually have a good day
with customers you help them they're
happy about it you know it's all good
but all the all the unpleasant stuff has
to do with meetings and just running
into people
so now we found a way to make meetings
even worse
apparently the hybrid the so-called
hybrid meetings where some people are on
video and some people are in the room
it turns into a whole second class
citizen thing if you're on video
you know and it's it's a terrible look
and you have to look at these little
postage stamp people in the crowd and
but there are a few technologies
apparently that are going to fix that
one of them is you know automatic
camera focusing on whoever's talking
so that whoever's talking could be
bigger on the screen
that would be good that would that
already exists
it's a little expensive um and then
apparently the
meta model where you put on the goggles
and you go talk according to one article
i read who i wish i could remember the
author
um said that
the you know the goggles were annoying
so it's not quite ready for prime time
but that
the sensation of it was being in person
even though it was avatars at a table
the sensation was as personal as being a
person
now i think that's real
i think that meetings among avatars
are going to be important and what's
really interesting is if you're meeting
as an avatar that doesn't look exactly
like you
you get to change how influential you
are
here's something that nobody has i don't
i haven't heard anybody talk about this
let me give you two scenarios in the
real real world
in the real world you go into a meeting
and somebody let's say is applying for a
job
well use that example applying for a job
you walk in how long does it take you to
know
that you're going to hire that person
from the moment you meet them
how long before you know if you're going
to hire them
well i hate to say it's like 10 seconds
it is
because you just look at them
you think that you interview them
but you
don't
that's just an illusion you walk in you
look at them
and you decide if you could hire them
i'm sorry
did you think it was because of all
their qualifications and the things they
said
nope no it's just you looked at him
and now i'm i'm exaggerating a little
bit for hyperbole right
so here's an assumption i'm making that
by the time they got in the room
you've already checked that they met the
basic qualifications am i right
generally they don't even get in the
room
unless you've seen something on paper
that says oh they have at least the
background
so
now
has anybody interviewed enough people or
hired enough people to realize
that we're not good at it
has anybody had that sensation yet
you hired somebody and you thought well
these are this is obviously a good hire
and turned out to be a disaster
and did you learn from experience that
nobody's good at it
nobody's good at it
this this is why the the naval
ravicon theory
is so important
i think he's the first person i heard it
from
that hiring people is not the skill
firing people is the skill
because they all look alike when you
hire them
they all look like well you know i
talked to 10 people and
any one of those 10 might have been the
superstar i don't know can't tell but
you can tell after they start
you can tell if they're killing it after
six months
so if you don't execute you know the the
kill switch
then you don't have the skill to be a
good manager so it's the firing that is
the skill
and
um
all right so everybody's buying that
the firing is skillful
you haven't worked in engineering land
before so what i'm saying is that if you
see somebody looking differently because
the only contact you have with them is
in a virtual world
in which they're an avatar not a person
your decision-making uh system will be
interrupted
and you'll have to use a different one
so
the avatar that you choose to represent
you
will have a gigantic effect
on your success in the real world
you just don't realize it
so if your avatar is a giant let's say
weasel
and you think it just looks cute but
people who see it think weasel or skunk
or something
that is going to affect you your actual
life
will be much affected if you choose to
look like a skunk
because it's cool and it's edgy or you
just like the color colors white and
black whatever
and so here's just putting it all
together you don't realize that people
pretty much make their decisions on
looks
because you're sure that you don't do it
i'm sure that you do
what you do is you make your decision on
looks
and then you talk yourself into it by
saying you know perfect qualifications i
liked how he or she answered that
question and but it's not really that it
just looks
it's basically how much you want to mate
with them
that's pretty much it
all right
and sometimes it works the other way
sometimes there's a jealousy factor
where good-looking people could be
discriminated against i've actually seen
that happen in hiring
because the people who worked there were
not good looking and they didn't want
anybody there who was
that's actually a thing
but the point is in both cases looks are
are the real reason you're doing
something
school choice one big in iowa in the
election so i guess eight out of nine
candidates
who are super pro-choice beat out
their challengers
including incumbents
so we now know that there's an issue a
single issue
which moves the dial
and it's school choice at least at the
state level
so
i feel as if it's time for a
presidential candidate
to make a stand on that
you know they always have opinions on it
but it's never been a central point of
anything
and
somebody could make that work
so watch for uh school choice to be the
big thing
there was a article that says that uh
weed lowers your iq over time
so if you use it every day your iq will
decline by 5.5 points on average from
childhood
do you believe that
if you use weed every day your iq will
decrease
5.5
points
not 5.5 percent
by 5.5 points
so here's why this is a problem for some
people more than others
suppose your iq is 100
supposedly average
society is built for people with roughly
an iq of 100
because if they didn't build it that way
people wouldn't be able to open doors
and
use cars
just operate society they wouldn't be
able to you know buy a bus ticket so you
have to make everything in society work
for people who are around an iq of a
hundred
well what take what happens if you take
5.5 points off of somebody who's just
barely smart enough to operate the
machinery of
of civilization
it's dangerous
i would say if you take somebody who's
marginally smart enough to
navigate life
and you take five points off their iq
you've turned them into
kind of a high functioning
and maybe that's not such a good thing
so
if you have an iq of 100 i do not
recommend
smoking pot every day
i mean i don't disrecommend it i'm not a
doctor
so don't take my advice either way that
would be my my overall advice
but i suppose you had an iq of 145
and you smoked weed and took five five
points off it
you'd still be the smartest person in
the room
would it make any difference
so
let's say the side effect is the same as
five points off your iq no matter who
you are
i'm going to make an argument that for
some people
might not make a difference
you know if they're i suppose if they're
physicists
maybe maybe lay off the weed that would
be a good idea
but
suppose they were just
you know over qualified for their job
well in that case
maybe they got a little little despair
now
here's the first question i asked about
this study
did they study
sativa users or indica
because it's really different
sativa makes you more creative and
smarter
i'm just gonna i'm gonna just assert
that
now that's not based on science
it's based on a lot of experience
for the first 15 minutes that you
experience sativa
you're smarter
i'm not going to tell you which of my
ideas that people like and have spread
around
came up
were concocted in the fifth first 15
minutes after smoking punk
but it's a lot
it's a lot
and
if you were to if you were to smoke uh
sativa you get that effect
more creative and you know you're
actually more energetic for a little
while
but if you smoke indica
and these both have a a dominant hybrid
so they're not pure in either case
usually they're usually not pure so
they're mixes but they're dominant one
way or the other if you do an indica
dominant it just makes you sleepy and
stupid
that's why people do it
to relax and go to sleep
so
do you think that the
do you think that the long-term
iq effect
of taking a drug that makes you sleepy
and stupid
would be the same as the long-term
effect of somebody who took only the
the sativa version
which makes you literally smarter but
for a little while and then you
you know you plunge after that
what if the iq effect is due to a lack
of motivation exactly
because sativa
can make you feel more motivated
you to do things you weren't even
motivated to do before
whereas indica may indicate makes you
less motivated because that's why you
take it to slow yourself down
so here's the first question i'd ask is
if they didn't break that out
i think i i tweeted it so if you want to
see the sources for any of these things
look in my twitter feed for the same day
as i talk about it it's usually there
all right
so i saw a video that apparently has
been out in a while i don't know how
many weeks but it's a video in which ted
cruz
was talking to
the fbi representative
and asked whether the fbi had been
involved in instigating any part of the
january 6
event
and
here's what i found interesting now
somebody said this is a real old video
like from january
did does anybody have a confirmation
when this was because i think some of
you saw it in my twitter feed
but it's not brand new
but it's relevant more now
than when it was new
because now we're in the middle of these
january 6 hearings so we have a lot more
context
so now when you look at it it really
reads different
because we have more context
and here's what happened
so ted cruz in his
prosecutorial
brilliance because he's really good at
this stuff
was grilling the fbi representative
if the fbi he has to he asked the
question in a number of ways
to say yes or no
was the fba involved in any part of
instigating january 6.
and specifically ray epps
and the fbi representative refused to
answer any of the questions
and at one point mentioned
you know sources and methods
as something that they don't want to
give away accidentally so they can't
answer questions because
it's questions about the secret stuff
now i interpret that as a confirmation
that the fbi instigated january 6 or was
involved in some way
that was important
how do you interpret it
because the ways and means uh
explanation isn't real
it isn't real
because it would be very easy to carve
out an answer that didn't give anything
away
and it goes like this
uh mr cruz
uh we don't give away you know all the
details of our undercover work or
operational stuff but i can tell you
with complete certainty
that the fbi did not instigate anything
or talk anybody into anything or try to
get anybody to
break the law
we don't do that and that definitely did
not happen in this case beyond that
i think you'll understand i don't want
to answer any detailed questions because
that would get to sources and methods
but for the benefit of the public let me
just say certainly
the fbi is not out there breaking laws
they did not break any laws or or try to
incentivize anybody to break any laws
for any purpose at all we don't do that
that's not the business we're in
now
did i just give away any sources and
methods
i don't think i did did i
i don't believe there were any sources
and methods that i just gave away
but i told you a very direct answer
didn't i
no
what the thing you're worrying about no
we didn't do that
but beyond that don't ask any detailed
questions because i would be giving away
sources and methods
now here's why i consider this a
confirmation from the fbi that they were
involved
because it's too easy to say you weren't
it's too easy
i just did it
but i'm not like
the spokesperson for the government i
would think that they would be trained
well enough to answer a question like
that
it's not even hard i mean what was the
degree of difficulty
in saying we can't give away secret
stuff but i'll tell you we didn't have
anything to do with
what you're a legend
i mean
if you're not willing to say that
directly
it's because you're confirming it's real
i don't have another way to interpret it
do you
because if your interpretation is that
they genuinely were trying to
protect sources and methods
i just gave you the answer that proves
that wasn't real
it was too easy
so
this is another one of those outrage
things where i have outrage exhaustion
do i go work on this border patrol you
know unfairly accused whipper gate
problem
or do i do something about the fact that
the fbi just
effectively
for all practical purposes confirmed
that they were behind
ins instigating a
series of violent uh actions they're now
being blamed on republicans people went
to jail and the entire politics of the
country will change
probably because of this
and the fbi is clearly hiding something
that they shouldn't be hiding from the
public
now
are you not outraged
because to
me they just admitted one of the biggest
crimes of the century
i mean this is a really big crime
if i'm interpreting it correctly and if
i'm not interpreting it correctly
the fbi could always clarify
and say oh let's follow up with the
clarification
we can't give you sources and method
stuff but we can say for sure
that we were not uh instigators of that
event
too easy it's just too easy
and they can't do that they can't do
that
so
i i'm just
out of our age i just don't have enough
um
the uh individual whose name i can never
uh successfully pronounce
jenk jenk uh iger
is that close
c e n k jenk i think that's jen craig
and
whenever i mispronounce anybody's name i
always like to tell you
like i feel bad about it and i'm not
doing it disrespectfully
i uh
i just sometimes don't know the name
euger
so it's a
chanceuger okay let's go with that
he says
uh what do we do when this is in a tweet
what do we do when 40 of our fellow
americans just don't believe in facts
anymore
what do you think of that what do we do
when 40 of americans just don't believe
in facts anymore to which i say
that's not what's happening
that's not what's happening at all
everybody believes in facts
what we don't believe in
is who's telling us the facts
we don't believe you
it's not the facts that are lying to us
it's you
it's you you're the liar
no you you
facts
facts are excellent
i haven't met a fact i didn't like
in fact i've never even had a fight with
a fact
no fact has ever tried to blind me
no fact has ever insulted me
in fact
i have a good relationship with facts
when i know what they are
what i don't have a good relationship
with
big old liars who are telling me that
they know the facts and i don't
i got a got a big old problem with them
and
um
i saw two on the same theme jim cramer
you know investment guru jim cramer
he tweeted why can't we accept
uh the most fed chiefs have not faced a
heinous war against a democracy
interesting way to put it a heinous war
against a democracy and a large country
that doesn't believe in the science
really
do we have a country that doesn't
believe in the science
is is that the problem
do you wake up ever and say you know
i don't believe in science
nope
so i sent a clear a correction on his
tweet i i retweeted it with a correction
i said
the the public doesn't believe
scientists
for good reasons
but we still believe science is our best
system for figuring out the truth
so let me be clear
science
we all like
am i right
we all like science
as the best system to get as close as
you can to the truth over time
every one of us 100
we don't necessarily like the scientists
how about the facts is there anybody
here who hates the facts
any fact haters here or or disbelievers
do you believe facts don't exist
no no
but i bet there are people who think
that they're liars
do liars exist
yes they do
yes they do
so
let's get it straight
we love we love facts we love science we
don't trust scientists
and we don't trust people who tell us we
got our facts wrong even if we did i'm
just saying that we don't trust them
you know maybe you shouldn't trust
yourself
because
i'm pretty sure you get the facts wrong
sometimes
i'm pretty sure you've seen me get facts
wrong
fairly frequently
am i right
i mean i do this
in front of people every day i mean i'm
doing this in front of witnesses
so you know i'm trying to get it right
you know it's like i'm i'm immersed in
trying to get the the story right but
you've seen me get basic facts wrong
a bunch of times right if you've been
watching for a while
because and i get called out in the
comments all the time you've seen it on
twitter
people will call me out on a fax i'll
talk about one in a moment
so
i don't know we like facts we don't like
liars
all right um have you noticed that
everything is broken
i i feel like i woke up in a third world
country i'm going to give you the
smallest example just for my life if i
could just be
you know self-indulgent for a moment but
i keep hearing stories from other people
that they can't get the most basic damn
things done
that seemed to work fine
just a while ago
and part of it is because there aren't
enough employees
some of it is shortages of goods some of
it is incompetent some of it is red tape
but some of it is complexity too
and some combination of all those things
so there are all these weird forces that
have sort of
you know come together
but here was a little experience i had
all right so yeah so uh was it yesterday
uh i was trying to get some
um
healthcare
for somebody in my circle not me so
there's a minor injury
everything's fine don't worry about the
injury all right so the injury is not
the story minor injury doesn't matter
the details
and
i i was trying to figure out
should i go to my kaiser permanente
northern california
minor care so that's one thing they have
urgent care that's a different thing to
have
or emergency care
all of them are in different towns
so it's not like you could go to one
place and then they tell you which one
they're different towns
so you'd have to drive pretty far
and find out you went to the wrong one
now here's the thing so i so i try to
find out like there should be a website
where i can quickly see
if you have this kind of problem go here
i couldn't find it
but of course it's also
when you don't have all of your senses
about you because you're working fast
you know you're trying to get something
done quickly for somebody who needs it
right away
and so you're driving and you're like
you're googling on your phone and trying
to read their website to figure out
where to go
is it
minor urgent
or
emergency and
call the hospital somebody says
do you know how much that doesn't work
so yes i tried calling
and i said
that and when you call the health care
they start asking you questions all
right what's up what's your number of
your card your membership number
phone numbers and stuff
and so as soon as they they they
answered and started asking questions i
said let me shortcut this i only need to
know where to go
here's here's the situation tell me
which facility to go to that's all i
need
what do you think happened
do you think that the employee said oh
okay hearing what your problem is
here's the address you want to go to
nope couldn't do that
do you know why
because i didn't have the health care
number for the person
so couldn't tell me which facility to go
to
because one requires an appointment and
one doesn't
and so can't make an appointment without
a membership number
and couldn't even tell me where to go to
like work it out in person
i had to tell them
where the facility was that was closest
to me because they couldn't figure it
out
because the first thing they told me was
the wrong city and i said
i kind of vaguely remember that the city
right next to me has one of these oh let
me check that oh well you're right they
do have one right next to you
this isn't an emergency
in an emergency
i the customer had to figure out based
on my vast metal medical experience what
does minor care urgent care or emergency
room
mean and which is the right one what
requires what waiting time
and and let me tell you that
if you've got you know a minor injury
that
you're not a medical expert you think
well it looks minor to me
but what if it only looks minor to me
and i go to the wrong place
i couldn't get any help i ended up
basically guessing and
i think by the time we got actual help
i think it was eight hours later
so this is somebody bleeding
and got help eight hours later
i pay for that health care now i don't
think that things were this bad a year
ago
or two years ago i feel like everything
broke
can show me in the
in the comments
are you having the same experience
because that was just one anecdote you
know you don't need to care about my
little problem
but i feel like nothing's working
like all the things
are too hard all the things
yeah i don't know i i don't know if it's
a bunch of different reasons or there's
like some
larger effect going on here but
yeah i just woke up in not even the same
country anymore
i mean the headlines i'm looking at are
that my electricity is not is no longer
reliable in california
and that there's a very high likelihood
that i'll have neither water nor
electricity sometime this summer
think about that
i could have no water and no electricity
this summer
and i don't think anybody's doing
anything about it
seriously i don't think anybody's doing
anything about it that i know of
so
that's weird
let's talk about
republicans getting hunted
um how many situations have we seen
where that's happening
so we've seen the russia collusion hoax
could have put people in jail actually
did because of you know some unrelated
reasons but
um
so that's a democrat hoax that would
have put
republicans in jail
for a hoax
january 6th thing now that the fbi has
indirectly confirmed it now that's my
subjective opinion
that in listening to their answer
the right way to process it is as a
confirmation that they were behind it in
a substantial way we don't know
how substantial
but it's there
and that looks like well that's already
put people in jail now they're in jail
for doing things they shouldn't have
done in most cases
but it still was it looks like
uh the larger context is
it's being it's being treated in a hoax
way basically because
they're treating the
small number of bad people
as representative of the whole event
then there's this border patrol whipping
thing and then these border patrol
people will probably be punished in some
way
and
and then there's also a story about
there's some
terrorist group that's attacking the
pro-life centers
so that's again republicans being
haunted now as have been pointed out in
the past this went the other way
that it was the abortion provider
centers that were being
targeted but i think that hasn't
happened lately so in terms of a a trend
it looks like
republicans are being hunted
i have a fascinating
update on gun safety and murder
want me to blow your mind all right
so uh panda tribune
a twitter account you should be
following
made a claim yesterday that i questioned
on twitter and the claim was that from
1993 to
2013
the cdc found that gun murders per
capita
declined by 40 percent
yet gun ownership per capita increased
by 56 percent
and i said that doesn't sound right
so
panda tribune
provided a long thread with full sources
and sure enough
pew research i think was the one that
during that time gun murders dropped a
lot 40 percent
but gun ownership zoomed up 56
so would that suggest to you
that either guns are unrelated to murder
rates
or does it suggest to you
that owning more guns reduced the number
of people getting murdered
what would you
say
the correct answer is
you can't tell anything from this
that's the correct answer the correct
answer is that there was something that
had nothing to do with guns
there was changing crime
of all kinds
so i'm pretty sure from 1993 to 2013
that all kinds of crimes
violent crimes were all way less
and i think there's some argument about
what that was i mean freakonomics
thought it was something about abortion
i don't know if that's checked out or
not
but
there were some number of factors
that substantially made everything safer
at the same time the number of guns was
going up so what could you say about gun
ownership
either making more or less gun murder
based on this data
well i would say you can't tell
because there's something bigger than
gun ownership much bigger
that's changing how people are acting
and that whatever the guns are doing is
being masked by some larger social
change
so you could not tell
you cannot answer this question from
this data
if i added guns or subtracted guns from
this society
would there be more or fewer murders
there's no this data doesn't tell you
anything
on that so you can't answer the question
do more guns cause more murder
even if
more guns happened during a time when
there was less murder
because remember the larger outside
thing whatever is making less violent
crime in general is overwhelming
whatever the guns are doing or not doing
so you just can't tell it's hidden
uh you can at least say guns aren't a
huge factor
can you
can you
it depends how you define huge
you could certainly say it's more of a
gray area where some people would say
it's huge and something wouldn't
maybe
i think it's a little more of a gray
area
all right
so we don't know what the trend would
have been if the larger outside trends
had not been what they were
but here's another thing did you know
that gun deaths correlate with
income
you probably do that right
the higher your income the less likely
you're going to get murdered with a gun
right
and so when i look at the united states
having you know sort of extreme
extremes of poverty and
and rich people so we've got income
inequality extremes
and then we we blend it all together to
see how the united states does compared
to other countries
but the united states is sort of like
two countries
you know one one is poor america
where things are terrible and one is
rich america where things are better and
they don't have the same gun violence
rates not at all
so
again there's something much larger than
having a gun or not having a gun that's
causing people to die or not die
also interesting that gun deaths were
correlated with more suicides
which is largely a white person problem
versus murder which is largely in a per
capita basis is more of a black person
problem
um but then i always think it's weird to
lump together how many of you have the
same feeling i think this is common
that when we statistically lump together
suicide and murder
that's just an apple and an orange isn't
it
because because here's the here's the
problem
philosophically
if you get murdered you got something
you didn't want
if you commit suicide successfully you
got something you want
and we add together the thing you want
now i get it i'm not i'm not promoting
any suicide so see a professional if you
have those thoughts
trying to be responsible here but it is
nonetheless by definition
something you want versus something you
don't want
now maybe you shouldn't want it
that's a good conversation to have maybe
you could be talked out of it maybe it's
never a good idea until you've you know
seen your every health professional you
could possibly consult
but the fact is if we just lump them
together we're just blinding ourselves
to whatever the hell is going on
we're just we're using data to shield
ourselves from knowledge
if you add those two things together so
we should forever separate them
and we should probably separate
rich and poor
because
suppose we find out that it's terrible
for poor people to own guns
but it's actually a pretty good idea for
rich people to own guns
what if we find out that's true what if
the data says that
well then we have something to work with
you could say if you're in a poor zip
code maybe
you know maybe you don't get a gun but
if you do well
or maybe it's by income
maybe it's literally by income if you're
above a certain income you could have a
gun now that would be the least
constitutional thing anybody could ever
do
but the data would lead you there
but however the democrats could not be
led there by the data because they can't
say rich people can have guns and poor
people can't
but the data might say so
do you think i'd be wrong
do you think if you studied rich people
gun ownership versus poor people gun
ownership
do you think that they would look
similar i don't think so
i don't think so
so if you're following the data
just make gun ownership based on
on your income
again it's the most unconstitutional
idea
so you know you can't really do that
but you know the data takes you in
strange places
so there's new hunter biden audio where
he's bragging to somebody that he can
get his dad to
agree to anything as long as it's sort
of compatible with what joe biden might
want to do
so it's more about changing his
priorities than changing his mind to do
something you wouldn't want to do
important distinction
but i don't know that this is new news
is it
because
joe biden has said publicly a number of
times that hunter is the smartest person
he knows in person
so it does kind of follow that he would
listen to his advice so it's sort of a
story non-story
because
it you know does of course
suggest that he's selling his influence
and everything else
but the way he's selling it the way he
describes it in the audio
does say that he can influence the
priority
not necessarily
something that biden wouldn't want to do
but the is of how he spends his time
that's pretty frightening
but we also kind of knew that didn't we
did you not think that hunter could
influence his father's priorities
i feel like i knew that
but hearing it directly is something
um
so
so ela so there's a
congressman uh jamal bauman from new
york
he's a democrat and he tweeted that elon
musk is a supporter of white supremacy
due to his announcement that he last
night voted for myra flores
now
[Laughter]
if you know this story it's immediately
funny
because they're calling elon musk a
white supremacist
for voting for a mexican-born
congressional candidate
and uh glenn greenwald you know called
him out on that as he should
and yeah i've told you that the world is
really small
like every time
every time i'm listening to a story or
watching a story it's shocking how often
i have some connection to it
that i didn't know
and so i went to look at
the twitter account for
for myra flores
and um
she was she was already following me
so i followed her back and congratulated
her for her for a good victory and she
thanked me
so
the world is so lit is so tiny
you can't
you can't appreciate how completely
mind-bending it is to read stories and
then say oh she follows me on twitter
i congratulate her and she actually had
the time to thank me
it's like it made this whole world just
shrink down to
you know two people sending a message to
each other it's just the damnedest thing
all right if i were a republican running
and i saw stuff like this like that
tweet every everything turning racial
here is how i would high ground the hell
out of it and destroy whoever came after
me with this attack
i would say
you know i'm running against somebody
who has a one variable filter
for them everything runs through the the
race filter
and i too think that the race filter is
an important one you don't want to lose
sight of that you know it's been a big
factor in the united states forever
but i would suggest that you want
somebody who works for you who can
handle more than one filter on the world
that's what i'm going to bring
i'm not going to lose the filter that
race is a big factor and we need to keep
an eye on that we need to make things as
fair as we can for everybody
but if you're voting for somebody who's
only filters that
yeah you know if if everything looks
like a nail to them they're only going
to bring you a hammer
and i'm going to bring you the whole
toolbox
so if you want to fix more than one
thing
i'm your person
if you feel there's only one thing that
needs to be fixed and a lot of people do
to be honest
then a a one one hammer candidate might
be your candidate
but
i'm going to offer you more than that
for the same price
who doesn't like a bargain
i'll handle the fairness issue as best i
can and as transparently as i can and
i'll listen to everybody's complaints
and i'll be serious about it
but also try to solve all their problems
and i won't see everything through the
lens of of race because i don't think
it's good for you
so that's my proposition
for the same price
because i would get the same salary as a
congress person as anybody else
for the same price i'll bring you more
tools
and i'll work on more problems and i
won't see it through that one frame
and you'll get a complete candidate
am i done
imagine listening to me you know as a
hypothetical candidate just giving you
that proposition
it would be over
it would be over
like that's it you wouldn't even need to
run campaign ads
just explain what your proposition is
i'm giving you more tools for the same
price
why would you take a single-minded
approach when you can have more
accept more
don't settle for less
you should have everything you want and
a few things you didn't know you wanted
that's what i'm going to give you i'm
going to try to give you everything you
want
and a few things you didn't even know
you could ask for
for the same price why would you vote
for the other one
you know i feel like running for office
is easy
and we just have people who are not good
at it doing it that's why it looks like
it's not easy
all right
so president biden tweeted this morning
i spoke with president zielinski
discuss russia's brutal and ongoing war
with ukraine i reaffirmed our commitment
to stand by ukraine and shared that the
united states is providing over 1.2
billion in additional security and
humanitarian assistance and i ask you
the following question
are we going to see that same tweet
every two weeks for 20 years
it will be a different president
but is it just going to be groundhog day
over and over
uh we gave ukraine another 1.4 billion
because it's a brutal war
putin sucks
you know they need it for all these
reasons
i don't feel like this could ever end
like when is what is ukraine going to
like be self-sufficient
no time soon
now i'm not saying i have a better idea
but i think you can see the future here
can we we're just going to be bleeding
money into ukraine forever
again i don't know what the alternative
is i don't have a better idea but
and the ukraine defense minister says
that the new u.s weapons will help them
get back crimea so in other words
there's no end in sight
because as long as our you know military
industrial complex
wants us to be at permanent war with
somebody
we will be
and i guess this is a pretty profitable
war because you got to sell them the new
stuff you know the the modern equipment
to have a chance
so
i don't know i'd say follow the money it
looks like we're in another permanent
war because it's good for the military
industrial
complex and
when ukraine says they're going to get
so many great weapons that they might
take crimea back
which to the rest of us seems like uh oh
no
don't try to get crimea back
let it go because you know it's not it's
not my crimea you see
it's easy for me to say
cry me a river
i can't be the first person who thought
of that
right
crimea river
okay
so let me back up and be less um
dismissive of crimea so i have great
empathy for the people who live there
because they're just being used as a
political football i mean it must be
just the hell on earth
to be in crimea and just be everybody's
everybody's you know pull toy
so
uh so for all empathy to the people of
crimea
do you really want ukraine to try to
take it back
is is that good for you
is it good for anybody is it good for
the crimeans
i don't know
who knows
so
anyway looks like that'll be permanent
i call it uh the dumbass region
not the donbass but the dumbass
because i don't think they're ever going
to stop fighting there
crimea is a beautiful piece of land i'll
bet it is it looks like its location is
kind of awesome
uh somebody says hunter biden's making a
profit off the war
how many of you think the ukrainian war
has something to do with the bidens
hiding their crimes
is it a coincidence
that
zelensky got the president of the united
states who was at least alleged
to be somehow in the blackmail pockets
of ukraine
and that he's acting exactly like
somebody who is
who is being blackmailed
now i'm not alleging that that's the
case because usually these conspiracy
theories don't turn out to be true
but you could say i think it would be
fair to say that the way president biden
is biden is acting if you were just
looking at all of his list of actions
for ukraine
he acts as though
he is being blackmailed
meaning that if he doesn't give zolensky
everything zelensky wants
zelensky might know too much
now it's also possible
that joe biden uh is very pro-nato
anti-russian and every single thing he's
doing is exactly what he would have done
under any situation because it's just
what he believes and it's compatible
with you know everything
but those two hypotheses both are
supported by observation
he looks and acts exactly like somebody
who's just a democrat and a president
and he looks and acts exactly like
somebody who's being blackmailed
when we have a strong suspicion that
there's a good reason he might be
i i mean i don't know how to put the
odds on it if i let's let's look at this
way if you were to put the odds on it
with only what we know which is almost
nothing
what are the odds
that president biden fuels a little
blackmail pressure from ukraine what are
the odds
25
i don't know there's no way to put a per
percentage on that so i think if you're
certain one way or the other you're
wrong
i mean you're you're thinking wrong
because certainty is the wrong thing to
have in this case
but i would give it 25
and
so we're involved in a war that could
turn into a nuclear war
and i as i consider myself a fairly
unbiased observer on this question
i think
i mean i don't know i think i am
and i will put it at 25 chance that our
president is not even acting in the best
interest of the united states
that's pretty terrible
now remember that the democrats do a lot
of projection
so that's exactly what they wanted
republicans to think about trump
that you don't know if he's in russia's
pocket
but look at all this
you know there was that time he said
something good about putin
and there was that thing with a german
bank that might have had something to do
with a russian thing but no evidence and
there's the allegation and the steel
dossier which wasn't real
and then it gives you this
sense
that even though like your logic says
you know i don't think there's any trump
problem with russia
but they can create enough doubt that
you can walk around saying
but maybe
but maybe
they did produce a lot of smoke
as we know it was hoax based smoke
you know now we know that
but at the time
if you said you know
there is a
solid
10 to 20 chance that there's something
wrong there
you wouldn't have been crazy
you just probably would have been wrong
you just wouldn't have been crazy
yeah it's hoaxy smoke
um
you just did the same thing
i think you're right but what did i just
do
oh i just did the same thing in terms of
saying there's a 25 chance that biden
blah blah blah yes i was trying to do
the same thing
so you were you're correct
just keep avoiding the huge elephant in
the room what's the huge elephant in the
room
the huge elephant in the room is
um
and elephants
all right
uh
natural gas shortage in europe this
winter yeah
so on social media there are all these
stories about refineries blowing up
mysteriously and there was another
recently
but i don't see any of that in the real
news
none of that's real
is it
do do you think the so the
food food processing plants
and also
you know energy facilities are having
some kinds of you know weird
number of accidents that don't look like
accidents
but
does that look real
i uh there's nobody in any
professional news organization who's
saying it's real are they
i haven't seen it
yeah
i i think these are just industries that
are um prone to excellence aren't they
because i feel like all my life i've
heard of refinery
um accidents
so i live fairly near a refinery
fairly near meaning short drive
so the refineries in the bay area and
they have
periodic alerts and accidents
so they have a sophisticated system for
warning the nearby town
of any you know leaks or fires or
anything
and it's been used i think twice
maybe twice in my uh
in my time here
there have been accidents which i think
fire was involved
at the refinery
and we know that those were not any kind
of terrorist acts
so if i know one refinery that's had
more than one accident
since i've lived next to it
it seems like maybe that's just an
industry that has lots of excellence
because of the nature of the business
and maybe food processing plants
have lots of accidents
is there any reason they would i don't
know and maybe maybe they don't maybe
maybe they're just lots of them and if
you hear that one has an accident that's
what sticks in your mind
so i guess i guess i'm a skeptic on the
refineries and the food processing
plants
but i'm definitely interested
right like my my interest is peaked
but i think we're well short of anything
that looks like proof that something's
happening
all right that is all i have for now
and i believe i've delivered
one of the best entertainment values of
your entire life
for the price of basically nothing
um well depending on what platform
uh you
you have been entertained for over an
hour i believe
what time is it over an hour
and i think it's the best thing that's
ever happened to you
or at least today
let's agree on that and we'll be back
tomorrow and it will be amazing
somebody says this is my closing closing
uh
uh troll
scott's career and credibility has
really gone downhill
and let's end on that
bye for now
