look at that view
foggy but at least it's not a forest
fire
hello hello everybody yes i will turn
out this light
i know you're going to ask me to
[Music]
you know if it weren't for low
production values
i wouldn't have any production values at
all
hey everybody it's time for coffee with
scott adams
i'm scott adams this is coffee
and it's time for the simultaneous sip
grab your mug your cup your glass your
vessel your stein
your chalice your thermos fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me for the simultaneous sip
now there are two funny snippets
on uh that i tweeted today both of them
are from cnn
and both of them are from uh brian
stelter's show
i'm going to try to play them back for
you the quality will be bad but you can
see them on my twitter feed
the first one is so
this is uh brian stelter and he's uh
he's interviewing on his show
uh alison camarado one of the
cnn hosts and her claim
here's the funny part are you ready for
this she claims
that president trump has no sense of
humor
and doesn't ever tell jokes
now the funny part about it is not that
the claim is so ridiculous
the funny part about it and you have to
watch it yourself you see it in my
twitter feed
the funny part is watching brian
stelter's reaction to it
because even he realizes that she's deep
in
trump derangement syndrome and twice he
goes
huh and i'm gonna see if you can hear it
listen listen to what she says but the
funny part is
up front he goes huh and then after she
explains a little
more he goes huh and it's the huh that's
the funny part
because you you see him realizing that
she's batshit crazy
and it's happening right in front of him
so it's one thing
for those of you who are trump
supporters to watch somebody in trump
derangement syndrome
because that's your normal situation
right trump supporter
sees a trump hater experiencing trump
derangement syndrome
but when you watch an anti-trumper
see trump derangement syndrome right in
front of him
you can almost feel like this light
going on and
so listen for it there's two two places
he goes huh
the first one is right off the front
it's one of the first things you'll hear
and wait for the second one because it's
hilarious right
oh yes but the problem is this is one of
the very unique things
about president trump he's humorless
this is not an original thought today he
is has never been captured laughing
on any camera of any kind he doesn't has
never made a joke it was not a funny one
he doesn't he's humor impaired
is and this is where the all right you
got to hear this again
the this is really sensational all right
yeah i'm just going to play it again
because it's so good
oh yes but the problem is one of the
very unique things about president trump
he's humorless he is humorous
this is not an original thought today he
is has never been captured laughing
on any camera of any kind he doesn't has
never made a joke it was not a funny one
he doesn't he's humor impaired
[Laughter]
now there is certainly
a lot of room for personal opinion
in politics there's lots of room for
judgment calls
but this is a president who's literally
famous for
for his sense of humor it's one of his
most defining characteristics
and she hasn't noticed she hasn't
noticed that his
rallies are basically stand-up humor
mixed with politics
she hasn't noticed that he's the
funniest tweeter of all time
she she's never seen him laugh i've seen
him laugh
you have to admit that's funny
but was it the funniest thing that
happened on brian's show
this week well maybe not
possibly uh possibly even funnier was
philip
bump who writes for the washington post
um so brian stelter showed a uh a series
of fox news
clips in which people on fox news were
calling
um mccabe's um
interview with 60 minutes where he
revealed that there was a discussion
about the 25th amendment
and on fox news it's being called uh
variously a soft
coup a low energy coup or or a potential
coup
but they use the word coup a lot so
brian plays
first uh brian stelter plays a clip of
all the times that the fox news people
called it
a coup and then he throws it to philip
bump who writes for the washington post
not a friend of president trump and
philip bump defends it as not a coup
this way he says well
it would take half of the cabinet plus
mike pence to actually
succeed with that 25th amendment thing
so that's hardly a coup
what in other words it's not a coup
because the odds of it working weren't
high
what you have to reach really hard
to say that it's not a coup if it had a
low chance
of succeeding
that is the worst defense i've ever seen
it's the worst defense well you you'd
have to really reach to call that a coup
because so many people would have had to
approve it
what
so those are the two funniest things and
i have to believe that you know
based on brian stelter's reaction to
to those stories don't you think
he's figuring out what's going on and
this may surprise you
but i'm going to give some props to
brian stelter you know we've been
watching him for
three years or whatever talking about
president trump and then candidate trump
before that and
he's no friend of the president
everybody knows that
and his reporting is consistently
critical but when i watch him
he seems more like a partisan who knows
what
network he's on and he produces produces
content that fits in that network
he doesn't look hypnotized to me
now that's just a judgment call right
but there are some people who look like
they're actually
experience some kind of delusional
thinking
and there are other people who are just
clearly on a on a team
and they're reporting or the way they
talk about things is sort of close to
the team
but they don't look crazy i would say
that brian stelter
does not look crazy he doesn't seem to
be suffering from
tds most of the time he say he has a
side and you could tell what it is
you know i'm sure he wouldn't he would
not acknowledge that
but you would you know it's clear that
he's not a fox news type personality
he's a cnn personality
but i don't see evidence that he's
actually like in some kind of
fog of tds whereas
when you see something like these two
examples
they're uh they're really scary
because they don't look like it doesn't
look like regular human thought
it looks like there's something wrong uh
and and that's hilarious so
we may be entering a time
when even the critics of president trump
start to see their own their own cohorts
their own peers as being crazy
so that might be the next step you know
it's been a long time where the trump
supporters think the anti-trumpers are
crazy
you know with tds but i think you're
going to start seeing
the anti-trumpers split in two with half
of them calling the other half crazy
and at least saying well the socialism
won't work and
you know you're going to see a lot of a
lot of dissension
within the anti-trump side
that's what i think now you saw the
story that
that trump uh allegedly
asked japan and japan's uh president abe
to
to make a recommendation for the nobel
peace prize
[Laughter]
and of course the president talks about
it as though japan had this idea and
then japan talks about it as if
they suggested that that they do it
and i don't i don't dislike anything
about that
because you know the whole the whole
process of being uh nominated for a
nobel prize
it's kind of political and there's
it's not really scientific the way they
do it
there's a element of popularity and you
know it's just how people feel
and it's the zeitgeist and you know
there's a lot that goes into that
decision
so given that it's not like a something
like a scientific process or something
the fact that he may be putting his
finger on the scale
allegedly is completely just funny to me
right and if you don't see that as funny
i think you're dead inside now
other people are saying he deserves it
and i think
i'm in the camp of he may be very close
to deserving it
meaning that this next meeting with
north korea
might tell us how serious they are in a
way that we didn't quite
know before so we'll see if this next
meeting gets us to a point where
that nobel prize makes sense
all right um so the jesse
small a or smallet smullet
i keep wanting to make a joke about he
he whose mullet dealt it
but if you don't if you don't understand
that joke
i'm not going to explain it
so am i am i right or wrong
that the news has unambiguously decided
that it's a hoax
has even cnn decided that the jesse
smaller thing was a hoax
can somebody confirm that or is that
just news you're seeing them
on on the right is the left also
acknowledging that it didn't happen
i i went back and i was watching his
interview for
good morning america i guess and
uh it's really it's interesting to watch
him because
now that we think we know it was a hoax
watching him uh tell his tale
was interesting and
the cnn thinks it's a hoax okay
so it's really interesting because he's
a professional
actor and so when you try to see it
after the fact you know once you've
already heard confirmation that it's a
hoax
and you look at it after the fact and
you you check to see how good a liar he
is
if that's what was happening and it
looked really good
what do you say because i was looking
for all the the tells
you know the little tells that
somebody's lying i didn't see any
now maybe somebody who's better at doing
that sort of thing
could um yeah he cried but actor right
so if you were to take the you know the
top one percent
of actors in the world and ask them to
lie
probably the top one percent of people
who have acting
talent could probably lie
fairly convincingly so
never let an actor write a script
perfect example
yeah and then there's that weird
connection between kamala and her
anti-lynching
uh legislation which happened to be
weirdly coincidentally at the same time
that
that jesse uh smullet
claimed that somebody put a rope around
his neck so
that's kind of a coincidence isn't it
or is it
all right um let's talk about mccabe
so i was watching the 60 minutes clip
where
i guess scott pelly is talking to him
and
it was fascinating to watch scott pelley
ask the questions because mccabe
describes
basically why they started the
investigation against the president
for this alleged russia collusion and
you see scott pelley's
uh listen to it all and then he just
sort of leans back and he's like
and why did you have to do this i'm
paraphrasing he didn't use those words
but you're even watching the person
asking the question saying um
and therefore like like the
the argument is so weak that it's just
not obvious why
it even makes sense sort of makes sense
so if i understand mccabe's argument it
goes like this
there was you know evidence that russia
was interfering in the
in in the election but then uh because
trump wanted to fire
uh comey and comey was you know part of
that investigation
that that looked like obstruction but
here's the problem
and and because it looked like
obstruction what was he trying to hide
you know why was he trying to stop a
a look into russia's involvement and
and here's the problem there were two
reasonable reasons
why the president would want to fire
comey
one is to stop him from finding out the
truth
and the other is that comey was on a
witch hunt
wouldn't they look exactly the same
how do those two things look different
you know if you're looking at the
president wanting to fire comey
there were there were two completely
good reasons
one comey needed to be fired and he was
involved in a witch hunt that's a waste
of time and bad for the country
and there was no truth to it and and of
course the president would have known
that
and nobody else would have known that
only the president
knew for sure that there was nothing to
the investigation at least in terms of
the president's involvement
he knew for sure so if the person who
knows
for sure fires a person that he is
legally allowed to fire
for a reason that he wasn't hiding which
is this guy's involved in this witch
hunt
there's nothing to it i'm going to get
rid of him and
other other reasons that gave him a lack
of confidence
that looks exactly like somebody firing
somebody to cover something up
how could you tell them apart and so the
question i
ask you is this if somebody does
something
that has both a perfectly rational
reason
but also you can't rule out the
fantastical reason
is that a good enough reason to
investigate the president
that you can't rule out that there was a
crime
do you know other situations you can't
rule out that there was a crime
all of them let me say that again
do you know what other situations you
can't
rule out that there was a crime
everything the the entire world
is stuff that you can't rule out there
was a crime
you know i don't think somebody's being
murdered on my lawn while i say here
but i can't rule it out you know i don't
i don't think that somebody's next door
embezzling
but i can't rule it out i don't think
there's a
horrible crime happening in my
neighbor's house but
i can't rule it out it seems like you
should need
something like positive evidence
shouldn't you the can't rule it out
doesn't feel like evidence because the
whole world is stuff you can't rule out
you can't prove a negative you know was
was mccabe trying to prove
i mean how can he prove that trump
wasn't involved in collusion you know
can you prove a negative
i'm not sure that made sense what i just
said but pretend it did
now um so that was the part
that in my opinion it looked like scott
pelley was
sort of acting like he didn't understand
the point
because i don't think i understand the
point either in other words scott
pelley's
response looked legitimate it's like
i'm not seeing the reason the reason is
that you can't rule out there was a
crime is that a reason
that doesn't sound like a reason anyway
it's time for the second simultaneous
sip are you ready
gotta be nimble
all right no predicate somebody says no
predicate
meaning is that just fancy lawyer talk
for saying that there's not positive
evidence
in favor of their theory
um mike wallace would have hammered that
fool
someone says
it's not a crime if no one is charged
yeah i'm not sure if that applies in
this case
but you know i also don't know if
counter
if counterintelligence has the same
standards as
regular law enforcement if your job is
counterintelligence it might make sense
that you
look into anything that looks suspicious
and it's
you know a different standard of
evidence than
taking somebody to trial so i will give
him that
but i still don't feel like that was
enough
that firing comey just didn't seem like
enough um
and and why is it and why is it
[Music]
um yeah
i hear a lot of comments about david
pakeman people
you know i did go on his show recently
so
he's heard my opinion recently
[Music]
and by the way you know
to his credit you know i i know a lot of
you think david pakman is
big anti-trumper and he is but to his
credit
he you know sought me out based on some
interaction we had on twitter and asked
me to be on his show and gave me
complete
you know complete uh opportunity to have
my say
so um you know if you're if you're
sorting out the good guys from the bad
guys
i would say david pakman has allowed a
full
a full hearing of the other side on his
show so you have to count that
you have to count that as being
reasonable
special counsels are for crimes not
counterintelligence
well but they look for crimes
mueller was cover-up for the deep state
all right so i don't have much else to
say on that topic do you have anything
else you want to talk about
happy presidents day
laura logan of cbs breaks from left-wing
media heist
i don't know what that's all about
all right looks like we don't have any
questions
oh what if no report
so there's an option that mueller might
not write a report or that we just might
not hear about it
so i don't know i think one of those two
things will happen
that we won't we probably won't get to
see the report
just to guess global warming
let me tell you where i am in global
warming so i asked
tony heller one of the most prominent
climate skeptics to put together his top
five um skeptical arguments
and he's working on that now so the
format will be
you'll i hope this is what we're heading
to
five simply stated points as in
you know this was measured wrong or the
science is wrong or whatever
and then i want him to you know
quickly explain what the point is and
then have a link to
a backup argument so you can see the the
data and the sources and stuff
and then i'm going to see if i can get
somebody who is a climate
expert on the other side to
um to respond to it and then i'll ask
tony to respond again
and we'll see how many iterations we can
do with at least
one of those points and see if we can
chase it down
to something like a conclusion
um
[Music]
so that will be interesting and that you
should look for that next few weeks i
guess
[Music]
what do i think of the yellow vest in
france i'm not really following that
can you roll blunts who can't
um no one has been killed by a man-made
global warming
[Music]
um you know what i'd i wonder
is doesn't it seem to you that the very
the very simplest thing we should know
about climate change
should be a sea level right wouldn't you
say that
sea level is the one thing that we
should be able to
measure to tell us if things are going
wrong
so i wonder if you could uh create a
betting market
so hang with me on this for a minute so
there are people who are worried about
climate change and people are not
and one of the biggest impacts of
climate
no matter which way you go even if you
commit to fighting it cost a trillion
dollars
if it's real and you don't fight it it
might cost you trillions of dollars
and so there's big money involved
but it makes me wonder if you could
create some kind of an insurance
slash of betting market based on
based on predictions of sea level
so let's say you created a betting
market where people who believe
that's that climate change will wipe out
miami or something
and they agree on a specific set of
things
to measure over the next 10 years maybe
five years is long enough but let's say
10.
and they make a bet and the bet goes
like this
that the people who believe that sea
level rise if it rises to a certain
level
some minimum level that the people who
said it would win the bet so
even though climate change comes and
there are people affected by it
the people who believed it all along and
were right
get to win the bet so even though
climate change might cost some
money in terms of the the larger economy
the people who were correct and bet on
it
win a bunch of money and then the
skeptics
who say that it's not the big problem
that is claimed
they also have a chance to take money
from the people who are the alarmists
because if they're right after 10 years
they get the
they get the bet they get the pot
and i'm wondering why doesn't that exist
and if it did exist
where would be the places that you would
measure
that you would be most confident let me
put that another way
is there such a thing as one place
that if that sea level went up as
predicted
you'd know that the the theories about
climate change were
absolutely correct or is it one of those
situations where
you can't tell exactly which sea levels
are going to go up by how much because
some could go down
and some could go up so it's this is
some kind of
you know global average of all that is
that the only way you could know
or could you say we're going to bet
everything on miami
that's it you know the other places
matter
but if it's if it's true it's going to
be true in miami
is that a thing i don't know if that's a
thing you know could you say that and
would that be a legitimate bet
i was like it's all it's just miami c
level that's it that's all we're going
to measure
that's all we're going to bet on and if
that doesn't go up
then climate change isn't real could
could you make such a bet
that's the question somebody says not
really because the land is also rising
and falling that's true
so sea level changes because land itself
can go up and down
for different reasons but we probably
know where those places
are by now right so we would know
if miami just to pick one place we would
know if that's a place where the land
itself
is moving so it might not be miami
that's the right choice
but there must be some place where we
can eliminate those other
forces and say okay over here the land
isn't moving so let's just
make this our place we we measure
i do understand that it's going to be
moving in different ways in different
places around the world
no matter what so i do understand that
but there might be one place that's
the good place to to measure and i
wonder about that
all right um
[Music]
would it be more sensible to work on
climate agility and resilience
yeah but the one place that it's hard to
be resilient
is coastal cities
so if that's where the big risk is that
you lose entire cities
then we could focus on that and because
that's
that's a pretty big problem and i don't
know how you could be resilient about
how could you possibly be resilient
about miami being under water
that's that's not something you can fix
with you know a rag and some spray
tulsi gabbard i still don't give her
much for chance
why is there so much spin up against
iran right now
well apparently iran has some
some new weapons they've got iran has a
potentially nuclear submarine i guess
that they launched and
they also have new icbm i think
so they're they're developing some
serious weaponry
i have to ask myself how good
is an iranian submarine
wasn't that your first you know if you
saw that oh my nose itches
sorry it's just an itchy nose um
i saw a picture of the submarine and i
gotta say
design-wise it wasn't it wasn't a
fine-looking submarine
[Music]
indeed i would be a little bit afraid
to be in that submarine
so i suspect without evidence to back
this up but i suspect
that iran's submarine might
not be the danger that you worry
i mean it could be that you know uh
that we can track it easily because it's
noisy
you know it might be that you know in
the real world
we could take it out in 10 minutes i
mean i don't know
i don't believe it's a nuclear powered
sub no so that means
it would have some weaknesses
especially needing to refuel um
your ideas on amazon new york city well
yeah that situation is pretty well
picked apart by other people
i don't have much to say about that i i
you know it is
[Music]
it's probably terrible for the socialist
side to be blamed for chasing away
25 000 uh jobs
because you know how people are uh
were influenced by anecdotes so one good
story
means more than a bunch of good concepts
it means more than math and means more
than good reasons
just one good story can be very
persuasive
and the story that socialism just
created
aside from venezuela is well we just
lost 25 000 jobs
because amazon is the devil according to
socialists i guess
so that's a bad look
people are asking will joe biden run
god i hope so is there anybody else here
who hopes
joe biden will run am i the only one who
thinks that would be the most
fun i don't think anybody else would be
fun you know as as
solid as i think kamala harris is
as a candidate and i would say she is
solid
she doesn't have there's no obvious
weakness
with kamala harris but there's also
nothing
special you see what i'm saying
there's nothing there's nothing that's
quite the
x factor there's nothing that makes her
rise above
she just doesn't have an obvious flaw
now some people were looking for this
willie brown connection that's nothing
you know people just don't care about
that stuff anymore
but joe would be interesting
because you know that the chemistry
between him and trump
would be hilarious you know it would be
a
quote extravaganza
and you know that he wouldn't win
[Laughter]
that's the best part about it is he
wouldn't have a chance of winning
i know he's polling the highest because
i think people
think in terms of name recognition and
they think well he has the best chance
of winning and that's all that matters
but the the anti-trump media
seems so clearly behind kamala
that i can't imagine that he would he
would end up getting the nomination
but will he run i don't know
you know it would be hard for him not to
run
if he is uh if he remains solidly
on top of the uh the polls yeah
how does he convince himself that this
isn't the time this is the time
but of course i believe he's too old
and um all of those videos of him
uh touching people
you know he's sort of a hands-on
politician
uh i don't know if any of that plays on
the left
you know i've seen those videos a
billion times
but i don't know if any biden supporters
have ever seen that video you know with
that video meaning the compilation
videos
of him trying to hug and kiss little
girls and
and they squirm away and they don't like
it but i don't know that anybody seen
that on the left so it might not make
any difference at all
somebody just said that kamala leads
unpredictable
that would be a better probably a better
prediction place
than just looking at the polls so why is
kamala the chosen one
well there are a number of reasons
number one
she is solid and she could
she could win and i think everybody else
is either
weaker in some specific way or some
general way
they don't you know they don't have the
right you know gender
don't have the right ethnic advantages
advantages in terms of elections and
[Music]
yeah she's the right age right gender
right ethnicity
she's a senator she's from california
she's got a lot of hillary's advisors
went to her but more importantly you see
that the
the media has sort of appointed her you
probably all saw the video of
there were i guess some reporters who
cover her from cnn and cbs
and they were joking and laughing and
trying on jackets
helping her try on some jacket at the
store
and they got some pushback for being you
know too friendly with the
person they're covering
um which was hilarious because they
they put her in a god-awful jacket and
the picture
was just horrible
[Music]
bloomberg i don't think bloomberg is
going to get into it
i think bloomberg will make the
calculation
that he can't get to the top three and i
think he'd be right about that
it's just not his it's it's not the
right
time somebody says i think mark
benioff should run you know i've said
this before i
uh i got a chance to chat with mark
benioff one time a few years ago
so he's the founder ceo of salesforce so
he's a
he's a billionaire and he's also famous
for being a
um philanthropist so he's got a hospital
that he funds and
he uh makes sure that his company and
his employees and himself they give one
percent of
what they earned to charity so he's
he's my uh my impression of him
from the little bit of time we spent
together
was that he's the real deal if he ran
for president i'll tell you i would take
a hard look at that
because he's he's not like regular
people
i'll tell you that but in a good way
he's he seems to be operating at a
i hate to say this but a higher level of
consciousness
don't you hate that kind of talk but
when you talk to betty off
you don't feel like you talk to a
regular person
meaning that he just seems to be
operating at some higher
level of vibration and i don't know if
the world's ready for that
you know maybe he's he might be living
too far in the future but
he'd be interesting he'd be a heck of a
candidate if he
if he ever got serious about it
[Music]
everything people say about kamala could
have said about rubio
that's a interesting comparison that's
not bad
yeah rubio also had the quality of there
was nothing especially wrong with him
wouldn't you say so marco rubio
didn't win but it was hard to find
something specific
that was the problem he didn't have any
you know glaring weakness
so i think that's a good comparison
what do i think of sherrod brown i can't
get past his voice
that shouldn't matter but in the real
world it does
i just can't i can't listen to him for
long
uh will nevall run at some point
i don't know if that's possible he
wasn't born in this country
um you see the fifth level like in god's
debris
he's somewhere in that neighborhood yes
yes he is tony robbins doesn't seem to
have any interest
in it you know it would be interesting i
think if tony robbins ran
you'd it would be i
i think he's smart not to run
i think he's smart to stay
doing what he does so well
oh trump slams about the media and snl
you know i didn't even read them
if i see a story that says trump says
something about snl
i don't know how much that matters to
anything
it's just business as usual
[Music]
yeah rubio didn't have any glaring
weaknesses but he didn't have any
glaring
strengths that is correct it's sort of
like when you look at tennis players
there are tennis players who can you
know reach the top hundred
by not having any flaws you know every
part of their game is solid
but the ones who make it into the top
you know one or two or three
have also a weapon so they don't have
any flaws but they've got like a monster
serve or a monster forehand or something
and trump had that he had monster
weapons but not having flaws
is probably not going to get you there
will i write another book like god's
debris well it depends what you mean
in terms of like it i don't have one
planned but
[Music]
um
it's hard to write a second book like
that one
does it trouble you that neval agrees
with you on
acc um i don't know what that's about
peter thiel should run was peter deal
born in this country
i don't know that he could run either
[Music]
um
have you noticed that nobody uh has been
able to come up with a good nickname for
kamala harris
here's here's a uh a humor
tip it's impossible to mock
things that make sense
you can mock things that are ridiculous
and and it's easy to do that you know
every every now and then you'll see a
news story and
everybody can mock it in their own way
and it's all good
because there's something about the
topic that's ridiculous
so it's easy to mock it but when
something makes sense
it just makes sense so let's say
unemployment numbers improved you can't
really mock that
that's an unma unmockable news story
employment got better nothing to say
about it
if you look at kamala harris and you say
to yourself
why do none of our nicknames seem to
stick
why is there no particular angle of
attack
that seems to make any difference it's
because there's nothing
there she's it's a target
poor environment she doesn't really have
any targets
anywhere so nobody's nobody's been able
to land a shot
early on i mean that could change but
so far
[Music]
so far she doesn't seem to have an
obvious vulnerability that would make
her easy to mock
so james woods somebody is saying called
her heels up harris
that's a good example of how
invulnerable she is
because the worst thing you can say
about her is that she had
a boyfriend you know some years ago
that's that's the worst thing that
willie brown was her boyfriend and
yeah he was married or whatever but that
doesn't seem to have bothered willie
brown
so yeah there's not there's just nothing
there
nothing there uh why nothing about
andrew yang
and the reason is uh he's not in the
news
i look at the news quite a bit every day
and
i i don't see andrew yang being
discussed
and if the news won't discuss him then
he can't win
so he has apparently not crossed the
whatever level it takes to be
interesting
now should he become interesting i'll
start talking about him but he's not
interesting yet
he could get there let me ask you this
do you think i could win if i ran for
president
i'm kind of curious about that if i ran
for president let me tell you my
uh what platform i would run on
i would run on a platform of
uh trying things
and following science where we can and
debating in public those things that
the public disagrees on so in other
words if i ran for president i'd say
i'm not the expert on climate change but
i will make sure that there's a
legitimate
climate change debate that you can watch
in public
and i'll make sure that we'll do it as
many times as we need to
until most of the country is on the same
side
whichever side that is one way or the
other i'm going to get everybody on one
side
of all these contentious issues now that
doesn't work with something like
[Music]
abortion right because nobody's going to
change sides on abortion for the most
part
just because they got more information
um
so i would be neither a republican nor a
democrat
although i'd have to run in one of those
parties in order to have a chance so it
wouldn't matter in my case
and i would say you got an idea on gun
control
i'm not even going to have an opinion on
gun control i'll say
let's let's encourage some city or some
state to try it
if you have an idea on gun control well
try it
and i will support small trials
of anything that makes sense and i'll
say why should i have an opinion
it doesn't even make sense to listen to
my opinion
let's if you've got an idea let's try it
we'll try it small
we'll try it in a limited way where
nothing much gets hurt
and then we'll see and that will always
be my process so i'll always be about
a system to figure stuff out now if we
were talking about the border for
example
i would have handled that completely
differently i would have made sure that
the public was
informed up the wazoo i would have had
those
engineers and experts with their graphs
producing things that you can look at
with you know arrows that say
this many people got through and this
this many crimes happened
but we put up a fence and this is how it
changed
um so
so that's how i would run for president
as a systems
president not a goal president
[Music]
the fact that you don't vote wouldn't
help you
[Music]
um somebody says no chance
with that accent the way i say coffee
i could never be president the way i
pronounce coffee
all right i don't think that i've added
much value today
so i'm going to sign off and do
something else and i will talk to you
later
