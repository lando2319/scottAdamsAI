well I don't know if this is working or
not let's
see we'll get you going in a
moment
H
okay this doesn't seem to be working
anymore okay well
technological disaster
wonder if it'll start working
afterwards now let me make a little bit
of change here and then we'll have a the
show of shows the best show you've ever
seen in your
[Music]
life
huh that's
interesting I can't get the show to come
up on my own phone to verify it's I mean
I can see your comments but it doesn't
come up on my own phone why would that
be let's see if I can follow myself and
I can't find the show
myself how did you find it I'm looking
on my own phone and I don't see the show
that's live right
now how in the world are you seeing
it is it out of
order oh it's out of order
there is the show that's live right
now how in the world are you all right
looks like they made some kind of a
change but I don't
know good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams if
you want to take it up to levels that
nobody can even understand all you need
for that is a cuper marar glass tanker
chel canteen CH FL V feel your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
hood of the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and this happens now
go oh that's so good so
good all right well how many of you saw
the optical illusion that involved a
Coke can did everybody see
that I'll explain it for you there was a
optical illusion going around in which
there was an image with a bunch of dots
on it sort of a a I don't know a DOT
pixelated kind of a picture in which you
could see very clearly a red uh
Coca-Cola
can the problem is there's no red in the
picture and it's the weirdest illusion
the picture only has two colors black
and some kind of aqua blue I
think but you look at the picture and
clear as that you can see the color red
red and a red Coke can but if you zoom
in on the picture you see there is no
red in the picture whatsoever now it's
one of the best optical illusions but oh
I think some people are at least on
locals you can see it um it's it's a
real mind Bender because I don't know if
I see the red because my brain knows
it's a
cocan and I think that might be why um
if I recognize it as a you know the
shape and the and the title maybe it
just turns it red in my mind uh or maybe
there's something about those two colors
that makes me see red I have no idea how
that works but I'll tell you one
thing if you have any doubt about your
reality being subjectively created by
your your brain creating a little movie
for you that should end it for you
because you can see in real time that
you're seeing a reality that isn't real
uh that's what's fun about Optical Loop
ions you can see for yourself that your
brain can create a completely artificial
reality and you can live inside it just
fine and the fun thing is that whether
that cocaine is red or not red we both
live in the illusion and some people
don't see it as red by the way so the
people who don't see it as red can live
and work and
reproduce and we can live in completely
different realities right next to each
other usually a red can I
don't all right here's some more
news there's a I'm going to call this
Evergreen news maybe this will be my
theme today the theme will be haven't I
heard this news before why is all the
news feel like I already heard it before
but you're calling it news
again there's going to be a lot of that
today have you ever heard a story that
sounds like this there's a company that
made a big breakthrough in confusion
energy first time you've ever heard that
one has anybody ever heard a story like
that big breakthrough infusion
energy can have it any minute now you
better you you can uh turn up the
heat all right well this one has a
little more meat on it than others some
Seattle based a company called zap and
uh they claim to have made uh
breakthrough in the economics of it I
guess is the way to say
it so they figured out a way to do
something that normally takes these big
expensive uh superconducting magnets and
lasers and they don't need them so their
technology is orders of magnitude less
expensive and quicker to
build so if that's true they should be
able to iterate rapidly and create the
uh the cheapest Fusion Energy of all
time apparently it's a um I think I
think Bill Gates may have been one of
the funders of this just to make you
suspicious yeah so I guess he put in
some money in this so do you think the
fusion actually is going to become a
thing because it turns out they they can
now create the heat they need and they
can do it orders of magnitude cheaper
than all the ways theyve ever done it
before I feel like they're getting close
I'll remind
you that several years ago Sam all
um told me actually uh in person that he
was sure that Fusion had already reached
the engineering phase meaning that the
basic science supported its feasibility
but you just had to try a bunch of
things in an engineering sense until you
got it and here we are several several
years later but it looks like he was
right they're just iterating until they
get
it I saw just before I came on the
Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction in
New York were
overturned or or a rape
conviction now he's still in trouble in
California right so it's not like he's a
free person but how in the world
is Trump being sent to jail and Harvey
Weinstein is being
freed does any of this seem suspicious
to
you maybe RV Weinstein knows where the
bodies are Buri buried maybe he knows
where the bodies are buried I don't know
well here's some news again that you've
never heard before this this will come
as quite a shock uh but the pope did an
interview and you're not going to
believe this but he's not in favor of
War
wow wow I didn't see that coming and uh
he wants wow he's he's even he's got
even got a
plan you know mostly when people say
when people say they're not in favor of
War lots of times they don't have a good
practical alternative to it but the pope
does it's called the negotiated
peace yeah so he's against war and he'd
like this thing called a negotiated
peace H I wish somebody had thought of
that
before you know I'm glad that we check
in with the Pope every year or so
because I keep I keep expecting him to
change his
mind and wouldn't it be great one day
it's like uh Pope what do you think of
War you know I've been thinking it over
for the past year and honestly I think
it's
awesome I'm all for
it no he's not going to say that um but
uh he also would he he refused to
confirm uh whether he does or does not
 in the
woods and I don't think that was a fair
question
really all right well here's another
story Bill bar
of all people ex Attorney General of
trump who of course Trump and he had
some problems toward the end of the uh
end of his term and uh Bill Bar says
that uh uh he's going to endorse Trump
because he doesn't think Biden is the
right choice so Trump you know I have to
admit one of the things I appreciate
about Trump is he doesn't hold a grudge
so he and Bill bar had some tough times
but Bill bar came out in public and said
he would he would uh vote for Trump so
Trump in his usual reciprocal way
decided that he would soften on Bill bar
and he put out a statement that said
that about Bill bar Trump said uh
despite the fact that I called him weak
slow moving lethargic gutless and
lazy uh but but based on his new
endorsements uh he says I greatly
appreciate the wholehearted endorsement
so I am removing the word lethargic from
my
statement thank you Bill so he used to
be weak slow moving lethargic gutless
and lazy but now he's been upgraded to
Simply a weak slow-moving gutless and
lazy but not lethargic not
lethargic and I I feel that that's big
of
trump but uh the other question that was
not asked and again I feel this is a
huge
Gap in our
knowledge uh does the bar in the
woods okay uh now we're going to talk
about Hillary Clinton and I'm also going
to ask if she shits in the woods but
Byron um Byron York is pointing
out Hillary Clinton said that Trump this
Hillary Clinton is so predictable Trump
admires Putin because quote Putin does
what Trump would like to do like what
imprison his opposition said
so she thinks Trump is like Putin
because Putin would like to imprison his
opposition Byron New York points out
that uh Clinton said this um and that
Trump did not immediately respond
because of course he is on trial facing
a maximum of 136 years behind
bars let me let me say completely
clearly I would be in favor of trump
rounding up almost all the top Democrats
and putting them in jail
because it's pretty clear that they are
a criminal organization at this point I
think it's sorry I think it's
absurd that we're treating the Democrats
like a political party they are so
clearly a criminal organization and
we'll talk about that in a little while
yes I think Trump should put a whole
bunch of people in jail for really
really obvious public crimes really
really bad
ones so yeah uh I don't want to make
any no equivocation a whole bunch of
people probably a hundred people need to
be in jail at
least all right uh terer Carlson's his
latest video is talking about all the
racism against white
people and he's got an author on that's
talking about some new book about that
and he says there's a systematic or
systemic racism in the United States
against whites and Tucker says everyone
knows it but nobody says it how
come
well I'd like to put forward a
hypothesis why nobody says
it how do you think it works out does it
work out really well no nobody says it
because other white people will destroy
them other white people will destroy
them the problem is white people because
white people will throw all of the white
people to the bus so that they don't get
accused of being
racist white people will kill as many
white people as they need
to to save themselves so no white people
are a disgrace because no we're
not even allowed to speak because other
white people will not let
us but uh I got my freedom of speech so
 all of
you all right uh scientists have a uh a
new holographic display that will be
maybe regular
wear do you know how happy I am that it
looks like there's a good chance that
everybody will be wearing enhanced
reality glasses but instead of those big
weird goggles the glasses are going to
look a lot like the ones that I wear
every day that's right I I remember when
I was in my 20s and I started to become
bald
prematurely and I was like oh this is
the worst thing because everybody likes
hair and I'm getting bold and then there
were so many Boomers that were losing
their hair
that they would just shave their heads
and then shaved heads became you know
not just acceptable but in some cases oh
it looks pretty good with a shaved head
you know you got your uh you Michael
Jordan Etc so a lot of athletes and
other people who shaving their heads and
I thought to myself well this is perfect
just by pure luck I was born in the only
time in human history when shaving your
head or being bald didn't look as bad as
it looked you know historically and then
but they still have to wear glasses you
know I went in to get lasc and they said
oh your eyes are not qualified for it
for some reason so I can't get lasic so
I have to wear glasses for the rest of
my life while everybody else is not
wearing glasses yeah I think even
contacts don't work for me but uh maybe
maybe the world will come my way and all
of you will be wearing glasses and then
when you see me show up you're not going
to say hey is there some genetic defect
with him that he cannot see as well as
the rest of us no you're going to say
there is a Forward Thinking
technologically savvy guy who is seeing
the world through
enhanced Vision that's what you'll say
yes that's right the world is coming my
way here's a funny study in uh Sweden
they did a study to see if there was a
computer game that they created that
would help students detect fake
news do you see anything wrong with this
study
yet before I even tell you anything do
you know what's wrong with that
study in the comments just shout it out
what's wrong with the study I haven't
even told you anything about it but it's
a it's in Sweden it was a computer game
and helps students better detect fake
news what's wrong with the
study let me tell you what's wrong with
the study it necessarily requires the
people who ran the study to know what
fake news looks
like now that's
funny the people running the study want
us to believe that they can identify
fake news you want to
bet why why don't you send the people
who ran the study my my hoax list you
know at least the one for the United
States see how many if they follow news
in the United States see how many they
think are
hoaxes how how about we we test those
researchers against their own news in
Sweden I don't know if the news in
Sweden is real or
not but there's no way in the world you
could do this test there is no way to do
the test because there is no standard by
which any of us can determine what is
real news that's not a thing and every
time I hear about in the United States
somebody's always says hey you know
let's train people on fake news or let's
put a list together of all the of all
the hoaxes and stuff and I always say
the same thing you can't because since
we don't agree what is real and what is
not nobody can put the list together of
what's real
nobody yeah you might be right but
nobody would believe your list so it's
not a thing you you can't get there from
here there is no such thing as somebody
telling you what the real news is we
don't have any ability to know that it's
unknowable you can you can definitely
look for you know for signals of fake
news but I don't know if anybody knows
for
sure anyway so
uh I did Biden sign the uh the bill that
would divest Tick Tock I think that got
signed right it looks like it's going to
happen but uh are you are you surprised
that the whole Tik Tock thing went from
nobody seemed to care Congress just
didn't seem to have the energy to pass
it to all of a sudden it's really easily
passed it just it just turned on a
dime it's all because of Israel
right I don't think we have to hide the
fact that at least on this topic uh
Israel is the tail that's wagging the uh
the
dog you know maybe there's other factors
for example I do think that our our int
people want to get control of Tik Tock
so they have a back door which they
presumably don't have if China controls
it so some billionaires are looking to
maybe buy it but I assume they've
already worked something out with the
with the intelligence people or they
wouldn't be able to do it or they
wouldn't even get serious about
it and there's a Republican senator Pete
rickets who says Tik Tok should be
banned because the pro Palestine uh
videos have more views than the top 10
us news websites combined so Tik Tok at
least for young people is you know an
order of magnitude more important than
all of the other
news and since there's some worry that
China pushed the heat button on the
Palestinian situation there's no way to
know uh the thinking is it's way too
dangerous for this ticktock to be
hypnotizing everybody now none of it
mattered until it until it was about
Israel again we all see the same thing
right nobody gave a darn about Tik Tock
until it was about Israel and then
Israel changed our minds on a dime when
I say our minds I mean our Congress if
you have any question about who's
controlling Congress uh it's either some
combination of Israel plus our uh uh our
intelligence people but only for the
topics that are Israel
specific so I always like to make that
distin
I I think that for every topic there's
some non-government entity or entities
that are in charge and that the
politicians always have to bow to
whatever that powerful force is if the
story is about Israel then the Israel
Lobby is the powerful one if the story
is about some other topic there's some
other group that's more powerful you
have his climate change or something
like that so it's not true that the Jews
are running the country what's more true
is that there are certain topics that
have certain interest groups that care
so much about it they put all their
energy into it and they can control that
they can control part of it but
certainly our foreign policy um you know
as a foreign influence I'm not sure
that's
bad it isn't necessarily bad it's just
the way it
is
um so yeah everything about that Tik
Tock situation is suspicious my guess is
that when it looked like it was an
option to just steal it from China and
take it over that our Intel people said
go do it
and and Israel was saying go do it so I
think between the two of them you know
if Israel wanted
it and also our intelligence people
wanted it it's going to happen right I I
feel those two forces would be stronger
than any other counter Force so I think
that's probably why it changed on a dime
Scott Galloway is uh sounding the alarm
on our low birth uh rate he's got a new
book
out uh what is it some algebra or
something anyway but is one of his
points is that the young people um are
not wanting to reproduce and get married
because life looks Grim old people like
me took all the money and they can't get
jobs can't build houses can't really get
going climate change is going to kill
them all they think so we've destroyed
the future of the country by making it
you know worthless to uh to even try
apparently and um you know Tik Tock may
be part of that who
knows but our us birth rate has gone to
the lowest level since
1979 failing to exceed replacement rates
now I think we've been below replacement
rates for a while except for
immigration so at the same time one in
four us adults uh 50 and
older don't think they'll ever be able
to retire so quarter of old people don't
think they'll ever be able to
retire and young people don't think that
it's worth even
trying at the same time I think there
were three or four separate headline
stories about the greatness of
masturbation I'm not making that up I
think the New York Post had a story that
it was good for your
prostate and another one that Billy ish
famous singer says she's a great
masturbator she should get a PhD in
masturbating and
then uh I don't know I don't think it's
I don't think it's an accident the
masturbation is becoming a gigantic
Topic at the same time that dating looks
ridiculous because you know swiping left
and right doesn't work for most people
anyway and uh people have become
terrible and you can't can't have babies
and it all looks pretty Grim but at
least we got robots am I right robot
babies I think people are going to be
raising robot
babies um it does appear that we're
going to give up on each other and find
new
mechanisms all right does that all sound
like bad
news there is only one number I want to
know
to know if we're
doomed almost everything else we could
figure
out but there is one number I'm really
worried about and I've never heard it
I've never heard anybody even suggest it
it goes like this what percentage would
you have to cut government spending
let's say this year and going forward to
have any chance of
survival because of our debt to have any
chance because if the answer is
5% I'm going to say oh well you know 5%
Cuts Plus growth in the economy H you
know a little bit of
inflation maybe we can get through this
if it's 5% if it's 10% I start thinking
whoa 10% a year that's that's a deep cut
but if we've seen in Argentina maybe
it's possible Argentina just went into a
surplus
from huge deficit they just went into a
government surplus but we don't know if
they'll have other problems for from not
having the government
services but here's the thing what I
worry about is that the amount you'd
have to cut government just to survive
in in just a math sense that the math
doesn't work unless you cut it this much
I'm worried that the number is
75% like literally that we would have to
cut spending 75% like right away to have
any chance of
surviving now if it's 5% or
75% normally I can make a guess about
which one of those is closer but I
actually don't know do any of you know
in a hypothetical sense if you if you
assume some normal GDP growth and you
assume some normal inflation that we can
handle how much would you have to cut
the budget right away and then each year
after that if nobody can produce that
number we're probably
dead if there's no Economist who can
even take a guess on that number uh
we're probably dead as because nobody
wants to tell you the real
number and when when I say dead we'd
still figure out a way to survive but we
would have a gigantic upheaval something
like a Great Depression kind of upheaval
we'd probably get through it but we
wouldn't like
it so here's what I think I think that
here's how we
survive you get a president
Trump and he says here's what you need
if you live in the traditional built
down places like a built down City you
really don't have any chance of
affording a home if you're young and
there's too much crime and the traffic
is
bad but if we build these new um new
cities using modern technology and make
it affordable because we could do that
now we we know how to build so that it
would be affordable and so that you
could get a job that you could afford a
home and you could raise children and it
and it could be low crime and it could
be no traffic and we could build those
and the building of them would become
the
GDP so you build the new cities that
boost your economy boost your taxes but
the point of it is that when you go to
live there your cost of living would be
so low because you built it correctly
you designed it to be coste effective
you have a a great quality of life no
roommates you know not necessarily
roommates just a great quality of
life and you'd have a job and everything
work so you could create a situation
where you built a city where getting
married and having a kid is just a
terrific idea and everybody likes it and
the and the schools are you knock crazy
and stuff
so so you're so brainwashed with the 15
minute City stuff really let me let me
be as as blunt as I can if you're
worried about the world economic forum
and you're 15minute cities and they take
all your freedom you're dead because
it's your only hope I'm pretty sure let
me say it as directly as I can if we're
not building new cities we're all
 dead so you need to to lose your
15minute city fear I'm not saying
there's no risk I'm not saying that it
won't be used to grab control or
whatever but if you have a republican
administration at least there's some
chance you can build a city that's not
designed as a prison for you and it
might actually give you freedom and
stuff so you need to get off of this 15
minute this 15 minute City thing World
economic Forum whatever that is that's
stopping you from wanting to build a new
city you have to lose it
you're dead if you don't that
nobody even has an idea how to save a
civilization unless we build new
affordable cities that solve all the
problems that we have with our existing
cities you're going to have to release
on
that now I I I get that it's a big risk
but you can design you can design that
way you got to release on it otherwise
we're all dead
we're dead if if you have another idea
why don't you Trot it
out tell me your idea I just told you
the only way you can reduce cost enough
to Live While boosting the economy and
surviving you tell me your way to do it
without building new
cities I don't know if any way so give
me your idea don't just tell me why my
idea won't work if you do it wrong every
idea won't work if you do it wrong oh I
want to build a new car with no wheels
well that's that's not going to work no
I don't want to build it with no wheels
I want to build it with wheels I want to
build a city where where people are free
not where they're more slaves do you
think that's possible it's
possible but the Alternatives of of
course are that we all
die so get over
that well in the mean time
um batshit crazy women have done some
more to destroy civilization I saw a
post by aarin saaran saying that uh
UCLA's medical school's mandatory Health
Equity class teaches students that
weight loss is a hopeless Endeavor in
quotes UCLA's Medical School mandatory
Health Equity class teaches students
that weight loss is a hopeless Endeavor
and that obesity is a slur used to exact
violence unfat people now I don't see I
don't need to see a photograph to know
that this is not fat man am I right this
is not fat man behind this this is fat
crazy
women there's no fat man who said no
that it's hopeless to lose weight zero
men were behind this I don't need to see
any facts you don't need to you don't
need to show me the photograph
no man says this this is badshit
crazy women and you we've got to stop
them men you're going to have to do
something to stop the Basia crazy women
from running everything they're ruining
everything they're ruining everything
and the problem is we can't talk about
it
honestly being crazy is a real thing
it's a medical problem we've got to stop
treating
craziness as a political opinion it's
not it's not a philosophy it's just
batshit crazy
stuff all right Elon Musk um says Tesla
should be valued as an AI robotics
company not a car
company totally agree based on his
estimate that they will sell way more
robots and AI stuff than they will ever
sell in cars and I haven't seen the
stock yet but I imagine it's going up
and I haven't heard yet if elon's going
to leave Tesla because he's not getting
his pay package when when does musk find
out if he gets his pay package
reinstated the the 56 billion does he
have an answer on that yet or is that
there's some vote that's coming
up I'll check on that
later all right
[Music]
uh so CNN has a
headline um there says that
uh that uh Johnson is like Churchill so
that Mike
Johnson um is sort of a
churchillian that's that's an actual
headline on
CNN now Mike Johnson is a Republican
leader and CNN which never likes
anything Republican is calling him
churchillian because he he passed the
Ukrainian budgets and stuff and
basically got both sides to do something
hard during a wartime situation so he's
churchillian Glennon Greenwald comments
on that he says uh Joe Biden and Mike
Johnson United to renew warrantless
domestic spying then to spend a 100
billion to fuel endless war around the
world all of which Johnson said he
opposed and then Greenwald says I don't
know what the CIA said or did to Mike
Johnson in the skiff but it really
worked here's his
reward his reward the headline that he's
churchan now do you buy that
framing from uh Greenwald that it looks
like some intelligence people got to him
now you probably heard that Thomas
Massie said he was in the same skiff
looking at the same stuff and didn't see
anything that
would suggest that uh a change in
policy so what does that tell you it
tells you it's not about any any of the
information it tells you it's about
people there must have been a person who
talked to Johnson because according to
Thomas Massie who doesn't seem to be a
liar Thomas Massie seems to be a
complete straight shooter as far as I
can tell he says I saw the same stuff
and I didn't see anything would you know
change my opinion or anything but mik
Johnson did I don't think it was the
data I don't think it was the facts I
think somebody talk to him I think it's
exactly what it looks like and Greenwald
seems to be on the same
page Christopher rufo no um meanwhile
says that he's getting information from
other countries sources are telling him
that uh NPR CEO who used to be at Wiki
media um Katherine mayor Mah uh she was
allegedly affiliated with us Intel and
had something to do with some kind of
government overthrow in a foreign
country
already
so I think we we can't say that she
works for the
CIA but we can say that she has every
single flag for being an intelligence
asset that you could ever
have if she's not affiliated with us
Intel it would be shocking because every
signal is flashing in the same direction
doesn't mean she is right you know I
don't have you know personal knowledge
but from the you know news headline
level of things that we know every
signal flashing completely intelligence
agent which would which would tell you
that our intelligence people do control
the media and this is how they do it
they they just put their own Assets in
charge or their own Affiliated people in
charge but at least our department of
justice is working uh well without any
hiccups uh let's talk about the Jack
Smith lawfare prosecutions trying to put
Trump in jail because uh you
know because he's on the other
team um so as far as I can
tell uh there were no crimes committed
but the question is whether Trump should
have immunity presidential immunity from
the no crimes so here are the no crimes
he wants use the word find when talking
about uh auditing the vote so that's the
first crime he use the word find so that
people who were idiots and criminals
could say oh we Define the word find to
mean do something illegal you know a
whole whole new use of the word find so
that's the first the first thing he did
wrong is he used a word that other
people said was a wrong word so I guess
that's illegal he'd go to jail for that
um they say that he knew the election
was not rigged but you know he acted he
acted as if he didn't know and that that
would be bad so there's zero evidence
that he didn't believe what he said
which is you believe the election was
rigged nobody there's not a single uh
document there's not an allegation from
anybody who was on the inside there's
not a statement a phone call a digital
record an witness to suggest that Trump
thought anything but exactly what he
said which is he didn't trust the
election outcome so that's his second
crime his second crime is we're reading
his mind and we're seeing something in
there that doesn't make sense according
to anything in the outside world but we
still see this weird thing in there that
doesn't make any sense so he got it he
has to go to jail for that so he has to
go to jail for using a word in a normal
way that other people have defined as a
weird way um no evidence of knowing the
wrong thing but they read his mind and
they saw that against every piece of
evidence in the real world they could
see something in there that was opposite
all the evidence in the real
world and then the third thing he did
which had to do with the the so-called
fake slate of electors is that he
followed his lawyer's advice about how
to keep his uh his legal options open
which is the the so-called fake slate of
electors who who goes to jail for
following their lawyers advice that this
would be completely legal and
constitutional do you go to jail for
that I mean I could imagine the
ignorance of the law you know ignorance
of the law is no excuse so in theory you
could but under this specific situation
where there's no evidence that
Trump had any belief except that the
election was rigged and that he wanted
to keep his options open and his lawyers
told him that this would be a way to do
it within the law and
thenan the fact that the lawyers are
being disbarred and and
punished suggests that they actually
meant what they were doing because they
did it right in front of everybody so
they must have believed they had a
theory even if other people don't trust
a theory which is normal in the
law so he used a word that they defined
in a weird way they read his mind to
find another crime and then he followed
his lawyer's advice to do something
which historically has been done before
without problems it's not the first time
it's
done and they put all us all together
and decided that the real issue is
whether he should be immune as a
president from the three things that
weren't crimes in the first place now do
you wonder if any law fair is happening
here
no it is absolute criminal Behavior Jack
Smith should be in
jail Jack Smith should be in
jail for
this now do you suppose that the Biden
White House was coordinating any of
these things which would be terrible if
they were well it turns out that some
unsealed documents now show that uh
there was
collaboration uh between the archives
the Biden White House on the Trump
prosecution and Jeff Clark is uh on on X
he's mocking
axos uh because axio says they're
zeroing in on Matthew K Colangelo
leaving the main Justice to go to work
on the Alvin brag prosecution team so
here's Jeff Clark characterizing that he
says also try Hardo axios this is a lame
way of Defending Co
colello and the Biden
Administration goes reality check former
dog official Michael zelden told axios
it's not unusual for a federal
prosecutor to leave a gig at the
Manhattan DA's office so it's not
unusual for somebody to leave a gig
there on you know in the office to to
work on let's say a hot case Not Unusual
at all call Angelo call Angelo's I'm
being told that's how to say call
Angelo uh but Jeff Clark says no it's
not unusual for a southern uh U District
of New York or uh eastern district of
New York prosecutor to go to the
Manhattan DA's office or vice versa yeah
it's That's Not Unusual to go between
those New York State
offices is that what happened something
normal you just wouldn't be from one New
York State
office to another no no that's not what
happened he was the number three he was
the acting number three official at the
main Justice in Washington DC and he
went from the main Justice I.E working
for the Biden Administration to all the
way to the Manhattan DA's
office that's not usual that is your
Smoking Gun that the Biden
Administration was spearheading the
lawfare against Trump there it is it's
right in front of us
but what percentage of the general
public understands the story that I
barely understand that I'm trying to
tell
you two
2% of the entire public no more than 2%
the laware is so
complicated that the normal person just
says 9 to1 indictments well he must have
done something pretty
bad but do you say but but but but can't
you see that the prosecutors were
organized by Biden it's a Smoking Gun
it's really obvious I mean you don't
really even have to dig too deep to find
out it's organized by the top that would
obviously be a Corruption of the vi
no at most 2% of the country cares about
the story and would care enough to
understand the details of it it's really
clever the government can get away with
a lot just by making everything too
complicated to really follow what's
going on it looks like that's what's
happening
there
um the Arizona Grand Jury on Wednesday
they indicted uh let's see Mark Meadows
Rudy Giuliani and a bunch of other
former Trump
staffers so now 11 Arizona Republicans
have been indicted on the felony charges
along with former Trump attorneys John
Eastman Jan Ellis chrisy
Bob
and uh allegations of conspiracy fraud
and forgery so I think this had to do
with uh efforts to what they say
overturn the results of the 2020
election remember when I told you in
2020 that if Biden were
elected Republicans would
be
haunted what is this this is exactly
what I told you would happen that
they're actually rounding up attorneys
and Republican officials and trying to
jail them for things that look pretty
pretty
suspicious as in it looks like they were
operating within the law as they saw it
anyway and this does look like just
hunting um I think all of these people
belong in jail if there's any way to do
it not not the people are indicted here
I mean the people doing the lawfare and
corrupting the justice system they all
need to be in
jail um big
time uh Jonathan turle was on Fox News
today and said that uh the best lawyer
for Trump is Elvin Bragg because that
Manhattan
case is so absurd that would be the
stormmy Daniels one where he's being
convicted for a non crime for the
accounting after the fact of a non
crime like no we don't even understand
it it's so stupid you know they felony
they may of two misdemeanors how does
that even
work so but again I think you would have
to be Jonathan
Turley or in the top 2% of people paying
attention who can really follow details
to even know that this case is
ridiculous all the public knows is that
Trump's uh in
court try try asking any Democrat to
explain the details of that case do you
think you can do it I think they would
immediately change the um the topic so
can you explain to me why Trump is in
jail for this Stormy Daniels thing well
he paid hush money okay but he's not
being charged with paying hush money
well he's uh indicted for 91 things well
no but that that's sort of overall could
you tell me what the stormy thing is
about well he lied he lied on his uh how
he accounted for it okay but are you
following the details that there wasn't
any way to do it legally he couldn't
call it a personal expense because that
would be illegal and he couldn't call it
a bus a campaign expense because that
would be called illegal and those were
the only options so he basically had two
ways to account for the legal thing and
both of the ways to account for the
legal thing
would have been
illegal so there wasn't even any legal
way to pay his taxes or to gr for it now
do you think any do you think any
Democrat even understands that none of
this is even doesn't even make sense
it's just
absurd of course not they just see us in
court every day and that's all Biden
needs all right uh two-thirds of people
according to axios what they call a Vibe
check
they say that
uh um 2third of Americans said illegal
immigration is a real crisis and not a
politically driven media Narrative
2third of the country believes that
Biden has created a crisis at the border
2third so there's one thing we could say
from that I mean it's a top priority
2third think that it's Biden's fault you
know that he's creating it you could
stop it anytime you want
presumably uh so I mean that's pretty
strong evidence that the polling I mean
you'd guess that the polling would be
what Trump plus
20 probably at least plus 20 under this
environment I'd think yeah well what
else let's
see also according to exos
um half of the people half of Americans
ped said they support deportations of
undocumented immigrants well I mean
you're just talking about the
Republicans right oh no 42% of Democrats
were in favor of mass deportation of
undocumented immigrants according to the
axios Vib survey by the Harris
poll
42% of
Democrats
support Mass
deportation wow I mean with numbers like
that there's one thing you can say for
sure Trump in the in the overall polls
he's got to be up 20 to 30 points I
would think over Biden I mean with with
that massive amount of support for what
is not just not just Trump's policy but
really his brand I mean his whole brand
is is this and even 42% of Democrats are
totally on board with it so yeah I would
say that Trump and National polls would
be up 20 to 30 points under this
environment wouldn't you say I mean
Common Sense he he'd be up 20 to 30
points so let's see what
else well Biden has suggested a gigantic
uh tax
increase and some ridiculous increases
in capital gains that are so stupid I'm
not even going to talk about them
they're so ridiculous now now when you
add this to the Border crisis that
during a presidential year one of them
is talking
about massively raising your
taxes so I mean if you put this together
with how unpopular Biden's border policy
is and the fact that the Ukraine war is
you know not super popular I think you'd
have to say that President Trump or ex
president Trump would be up 30 probably
30 to 40 points in the National poll
I mean based on this wouldn't you
agree I mean these numbers are really
really just absolutely
devastating so uh then rasmon said that
56% they did a poll 56% of Voters agreed
with the statement that with President
Trump we had mean tweets but World
Peace So
56% would prefer president Trump's Mean
Tweets because it got gave the world
well okay so now Trump is massively
leading On the Border crisis he is
massively head of course on taxes
because nobody wants higher taxes and of
course he's massively head on world
peace well I mean that's the end I mean
with that kind of a
lead I think it's pretty obvious that if
we check the polls Trump would be up I
started with 20% but when we see all of
these issues when you see the individual
polling on all these issues I'd say the
national polls Trump would be up 40 to
50 basis points
minimum so next story oh here's another
one
um all right
well so the next story is that the uh
Biden has pulled the head in the polling
yeah Biden has pulled the head at a
national so the meis poll and uh I know
there's another one uh he's bull
that so that's true
right so on every single sub question of
policy Trump doesn't just win he
annihilates
him but at the top level Biden has
pulled ahead he's actually got
momentum
yeah so
that's right the only news that uh Biden
made yesterday was that he wants to
massively
increase taxes in a way that appears
stupid to anybody
smart and he read his teleprompter
including the word pause because he
didn't know that was a a command to him
to pause and wait for the audience
reaction that's the only news he
made so
that's why he's pulling the head in the
polls because nothing happened
good all right here's another
one uh we're also told uh in the news
that the RFK Junior candidacy hurts
Trump more than
Biden it hurts Trump more than Biden
that's what the news says do you believe
that that the RFK Jr thing heard because
I've heard the opposite but now the news
is saying now we looked at it a little
more closely it turns out the RFK Jr
thing is hurting Trump more do you know
how you know that's true do you know how
how you know that the Democrats believe
that RFK Jr is hurting Trump more than
Biden well it's obvious because that's
why um they won't give uh Secret Service
protection to RFK Jr it's why they're
trying to keep him off the ballot in all
the
states because if he gets murdered or he
gets off the
ballot wa that's the opposite of what
they want no the news is telling
me that RFK Jr hurts Trump and yet the
Democrats are trying to get rid of RFK
Jr either through assassination or
keeping off the ballot even though if he
lived and was on the ballot it would be
good for Biden according to the news
it's almost like the news isn't
real I'm starting to think the news is
fake by the way jerich lueric made that
uh observation that their policies
definitely show they don't want RFK Jr
in the
race they definitely
don't so yeah I think our polling is a
little wonky at the
moment uh Thomas Massie posted today the
Republic is in trouble because Congress
is full of people people who were happy
to rubber stamp whatever the Pentagon
State Department dog FBI feds want most
are not compromised or bribed I think
he's right on that they're just going
along to get along as long as they you
reelect them and let them wear the pin
wear the pin I think it's the Ukraine
[Music]
pin I agree with this I think that we
have a zombie government and we're
driving toward a cliff with our uh debt
everything else can survive can't
survive the debt so they get the zombie
car driving toward the cliff and there's
absolutely nothing that's going to
change the direction and Thomas Massie
is in the middle of it and he's telling
you there's nothing happening that would
change the direction of the
car do you know what would change it if
somebody had a number of how much you
could cut the budget to save us all and
that number was believable and low
enough
if Trump or maybe uh vake with a you
know with a boost could come up with
that
number it's the only number that
matters there's one
number that you need to know it's that
number nobody has ever tried to produce
it or even estimate
it why is
that yeah I I think the number is so big
it's shocking if they told told you how
much they had to reduce the uh the debt
I think you would see it can't be done
and that's why they don't tell you I
think you would give
up and I think that's what Thomas Massie
is saying directly there's nothing
that's going to keep the clown car from
going off the cliff and there's nothing
developing that would stop
it because you don't see Trump saying if
I get elected I'll cut the budget by
enough to fix the debt you don't see him
saying it
and you know that they're smart enough
at least now with v on the case and by
the way look let me say this directly
V if there is a number that would work
you know even if it's in Argentina like
gigantic number we need to hear it you
know win or lose we need to know the
number we need to know if we have a
Fighting
Chance you know just just give us some
hope tell us the number and then tell us
Trump's going to hit
it I just want to hear that he's got a
shot at it I I just want to feel we we
have any chance of
survival because that's
missing we are literally heading toward
Extinction um birth rate wise
immigration wise and debt wise we're
heading toward dis Extinction and none
of the people running are giving you
anything that looks like a plan to avoid
Extinction I don't think it's too much
to ask our potential and actual leaders
to give us a plan that would give us any
hope we could avoid
Extinction that's not a lot to ask and
if Peter if uh if we can't get it from
Trump well then we're just dead because
we're not going to get it from
Biden so give us some
hope fake
you're the only
one you know that's true right that
there there's literally it's the
Spider-Man problem Spider-Man
problem the Spider-Man problem is that
with great power comes great
responsibility tell me one other person
in uh in politics who could give you the
number and sell it all right this is
what we got to do to cut the government
we just have to do it it's going to hurt
we got to do it
vake give us the
number and if it's completely
impractical tell us what you're going to
do about it tell us how to make it
practical you you don't have to be right
you know the world is a complicated
place you can't always predict the
future but give us some
hope give us some hope because the news
is not doing it and I don't see Trump
doing it I think the Democrats are
correct when they say that Trump is is
being non-specific about what he do I
think he can get away with it because
you know how he
operates so if Trump doesn't tell you
what he would do with Gaza is that a
feature or a
problem we don't know what Trump would
do about Israel and Gaza I don't know is
that a
feature or a
problem it's a
feature yeah the last thing I want is
for Trump to tell me what he would do
because
he what he sells is
unpredictability followed by good
negotiated
outcomes that's what he's selling I'll
give you unpredictability followed by
negotiating something you won't be too
unhappy
about it's a feature so stop asking him
to be specific about uh Israel because
being unspecific is exactly the right
play until he gets there until he's got
the you know the the levers of power in
his hands
you don't get too serious about the
details but when it comes to national
debt I need a
plan right the national debt that I
don't need
unpredictability and I don't need Trump
to do what he's done before which is run
up the
debt so you can't tell me oh trust Trump
because you know what he does no he runs
up the debt now you'd better tell me
something besides that and I need to
hear first in fact let me I I'll be this
specific if Biden came up with a plan to
fix the debt that sound in workable I
would back him because it's the only
thing I care about but we're I mean I'll
I'll probably vote on the January 6
prisoners more than anything but that
that assumes neither of them has a plan
for the debt but if somebody comes up
with the debt plan you own
me if you come up with a real plan to
own the debt
I'm on
board I'm on
board so let's see if that's even
possible if we're doomed I'd like to
find out sooner than
later I'd like to adjust you know give
me give me a little time to you know get
my food supplies in and get my get my
seed sprouted
working all right I had one other thing
I reminded myself to talk
about uh but I already did so that's
good
um I think what's going to happen is a
major shift in
society I don't know what it'll trigger
it but it's it's guaranteed to happen I
think our old method of you know you get
a job you buy a house you retire at 65
you know after you had your two and a
half kids that might be gone
forever I think it might be a mistake to
try to get back to it I hate to say um
certainly for some people people the
family situation is going to be the the
number one thing forever but there's a
whole bunch of people who just need some
other way of living and it could be
robots it could be combinations of I I
think what we need is
engineered uh
lifestyle now there's a phrase I doubt
you've ever heard engineered lifestyle
here's what I mean by
that I like to use my college dormatory
experience when I live when I lived in a
dormatory it was the lowest quality of
life because I was just in a little
cinder block room with another person my
roommate and it's the sort of the lowest
level of privacy the lowest level of
space but I was the
happiest and it's because they they
engineered the
lifestyle as soon as I opened the door
and walked out there would be uh people
my age fun people there'd be girls that
I was interest interested in you know I
would go to classes it was a nice
environment I could walk to everything I
didn't need a car on campus the food was
provided at a place where everybody else
went so I'd see everybody else when I
went to check my mailbox other people
would be checking the mailbox so I could
interact with them we had parties we had
organizations on campus where we'd all
get together it was an engineered
lifestyle so I'd be getting something
productive done I was learning you know
preparing myself for life but during the
entire process every moment was pretty
cool because I was around other people I
wanted to be around in a physical
environment that was beautiful and
everything was taken care of from the it
was easy to do the laundry just
everything was easy now if you build
your new city from scratch to maximize
lifestyle you're going to get an amazing
result we know we can do it that's what
college is it's a perfect lifestyle for
a
while so I think that's the answer to
everything the answer to everything is
engineered lifestyle so you put people
in proximity who can take care of each
other how would you like to always know
that somebody had your back in a tribal
sense oh let me ask you this for the
people on locals who have already seen
my explanation about um concentrating on
yourself and mental illness do you think
that's worth saying to the larger crowd
here
it's a little speculative well I think
I'll do it so here's something I I said
privately to the uh local subscribers
but I want to just put this out
here just for fun don't take this too
literally scientifically because I don't
have any scientific backing for it but
one of the things I hear a lot is that
you can identify people have mental
illnesses by how much they refer to
themselves versus how much they refer to
the external environment and other
people have you all heard that it's sort
of a common thing I see on social media
that some expert will say yes we did a
study and if you look at people's
writing in social media when they're
doing a lot of self-referential stuff
they usually test out with mental
illness and if they're talking about the
external world they're usually much more
mentally
sane now one of the things I realize is
that most we've got this giant uptick in
mental
illness what do a lot of the mental
illness categories have in
common they're all
self-referential meaning if I have
anxiety um I'm just thinking about
myself Uh something's going to happen to
me I'm in trouble things are going to
happen to me it's about me me me if
you're a narcissist it's literally a
thing about yourself if you're a
sociopath it's literally all about
you if you're pressed is literally all
about you because you have this horrible
feeling you're not really thinking about
the rest of the world you're thinking
about how bad you feel and so I put
forward the following
hypothesis we know that mental health
went to
hell when social media got bigger so
there there's a pretty direct line to
smartphones and social media and mental
health going bad what does social media
do at a sort of macro level I think it
makes you think of
yourself the the one thing the social
media does is make you think of yourself
now you're thinking of yourself in
relationship to the other people you're
seeing but those other people are not in
your tribe or your family so you don't
get any benefits from them so in other
words there's no social benefit like you
get in the real world but they make you
think what can I do where I could be
like them well where's my Tik Tock dance
so I think I think social media has the
impact of forcing people to think more
internally about how to act differently
to be like the people on social
media now in in some ways you're saying
but isn't that thinking about the other
people yes but not in the good way
thinking about other people in the good
way is how can I make somebody else
happier how can I make my spouse happier
how can I help my kids how can I help my
friends how can I help my co-workers
that's the good way if what you're
thinking is how can I compete with them
because they're prettier than me I've
got to do something for me to make me as
pretty as the other that's thinking
about
yourself and so I I submit to you the
following experiment which would cost
you
nothing see if if you're having any of
these mental
difficulties and you've not found any
relief through all the normal
mechanisms try focusing Less on yourself
and see if the cause and effect goes
both ways
because uh I do think that if you have
mental illness it's going to make you
think of yourself because you got a
problem you have to solve so it makes
sense that it works that direction being
unhealthy makes you think of yourself
because you need to fix yourself that
makes sense but could it also be true
that if you would force yourself by
creating a system or a habit of making
sure you did something for other people
you volunteer or you you help somebody
every um you it's charity it's something
it's just something external if you did
that could you reverse some of your own
mental
illness and that's what I don't know so
it's just speculation but if you look at
the fact that we don't know the
mechanism by which these smartphones and
and social media are destroying our
mental health I would suggest the
mechanism might be obvious it makes you
think of yourself
and when you feel lonely now here's
here's the real speculative theory
behind it I'm going to give you a
hypothesis for why thinking about
yourself makes you crazy in a variety of
mental health
ways I think that we evolved to be
social creatures and that who we are is
in the past was an extension of our
tribal and family feelings so that we we
we we defined
ourselves as as part of the tribe so
that gave you meaning it gave you a
place and it you know connected you to
this bigger thing I think that when
you're forced to think of yourself you
are removed from your evolutionary
biological most basic need which you
evolve to which is to have a tribal very
dependent connected situation in your
life and that as soon as you think of
yourself as a free agent floating around
without a family and without a tribe you
go
crazy you go crazy and you notice that
the effect seems much worse for women
right do you have a hypothesis for why
it would be worse for
women I do because I think women need
that connection more than men because
men are we've evolved to
be expendable
we we've evolved to go live in the woods
if we have to we've evolved to be
individuals we don't necessarily love it
but we're a little more adapted to it
you know we can make it work a little
bit better so I think everything is
consistent with the fact that loneliness
but more specifically thinking about
yourself is what makes you crazy because
nothing else really changed except maybe
you know vaccin s but that came later
food supply probably didn't change that
much during that period the only thing
that changed a lot was social media and
phones and you can explain perfectly
everything you see by this hypothesis it
would show you why women are having a
harder time than men it would show you
the exact timing of it and it would
explain the um thinking about yourself
thing makes you crazy thinking about
others doesn't it basically integrates
everything we observe into one
hypothesis but here's the cool thing you
don't have to wait to find out if it's
true you could literally just say why
don't I spend a month trying to force
myself to think externally just see what
happens my guess is that you would be
happier does anybody doubt
it is there anybody thinks that they
would be less happy if they found some
meaning in making other people
better
off I I think you all know that it would
work and that ladies and gentlemen is my
contribution to civilization that's your
your upbeat to the thought about this I
do think we can engineer ourselves out
of all of our problems but we won't do
it with the President
Biden we won't do it with President
Biden so we got to fix that first and
Republicans need to stay in the jail and
they got to put the bad guys in jail so
as long as the good guys are going to
jail and the bad guys are putting them
in jail we really don't have a way to
survive you got to fix that first so
there's a whole bunch of Democrats who
need to be behind bars and the only way
to do that is to get a republican
leadership in
there now um I don't think we should
have a republican leadership forever I
kind of like the idea of maybe it goes
back and forth a little bit keeps
everybody honest but at the moment we
desperately need a Republican
leadership that the the
pendulum is just way on a balance you
know it needs to find the center somehow
so even if you don't love the idea of a
republican leadership forever I don't I
I don't want either side to have too
much power for too long I really want it
now though I really really really want a
republican now ask me again in 5 years
I'll tell you well it's a little too
much we went a little too Republican
there maybe I don't know but um I know
your mileage might be different all
right that's all I got for you today I'm
going to say goodbye probably to all of
the platforms but I'm going to see if
we've got this feature fixed yet where I
can say goodbye to only the people who
are not my subscribers so we're going to
try this button again see if it makes
any difference didn't work
yesterday
and uh no
change yeah so it's not working today
so I'm just going to end end Today's
Show and the people on locals I will see
you in the man cave and I remind those
of you who are not part of the local
subscription that in my small way I'm
trying to work on this how do people
find me a meaning and be less lonely so
every night I have a very personal
conversation with a few hundred people
who didn't have other plans uh and I'm
directly working on the loneliness fact
at least for the people who are in that
Circle so let me ask you this how does
it make me feel to know that tonight
I'll be able to turn on my computer and
I'll be able to make 300 people happier
than if I hadn't done
it really really good how's my mental
health
perfect and perfect I don't have a
single mental health issue that I could
identify I mean I can't think of even
one I think I have perfect mental health
at the moment and my my entire
orientation especially because of my age
my entire orientation is you know how am
I going to distribute my estate I spend
a lot of time on that so it's basically
literally I'm in Give It Away mode I
don't need to work I don't need to be
here I do this primarily because other
people like it I do my comic primarily
because other people like it right so I
found complete mental health by being
completely externally focused and it
works absolutely for me so I mean I make
money by being externally focused I like
money and it makes my mental health
perfect so think about it and that's all
for
today I'll see you tomorrow or possibly
tonight in the man cave for
