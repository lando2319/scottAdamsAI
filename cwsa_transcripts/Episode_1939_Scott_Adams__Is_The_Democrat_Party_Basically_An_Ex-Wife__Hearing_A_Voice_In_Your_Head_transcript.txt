to find me
uh yep we have zero well yay one person
watching on YouTube that's all I need
I only need one person that's all
oh we got five all right they're
fighting us
well those YouTube people
they're resourceful
you're so resourceful yeah because
they're streaming back in
one of them is yay you think
uh
if I were yay I would be watching my I
would be watching this today
all right look at you
they're almost back in so
I'm going to talk about a few things
here while they're coming back in I saw
a I've heard this story before but I
want to see how many of you
fit into this category
did you know that not everybody has
a voice in their head that's themselves
having a conversation with yourself
huh apparently something like half or 75
percent of the public doesn't have a
voice in their head
so I need to ask you
how many of you
hear a voice in your head all the time
I mean I do
I continually have an actual
conversation going in my head
is but how many people don't
why am I only saying yes I do
I've seen very few no's
so that doesn't make sense does it I
feel like everybody would say yes to
that question
but yet the research acts like
it's mostly no or half of them know
yeah maybe we should just call
on that
I'm not sure that's even true is it
because I don't know how you'd not have
a voice in your head
now I I do know that it is a thing
so let me let me be clear
I'm pretty sure it's a real thing that
some people don't hear a voice but what
I don't believe is that it's common
yeah I don't believe it's common
by the way if anybody's watching on
locals because the YouTube feed died
um
YouTube is back up I just had to fire up
a separate feed so it's working now
there's just something wrong with it
initially
so you can see it on either one
and I always appreciate that you come in
all right
there are over 600 people waiting on the
Old Link
what am I going to do about that
there's nothing I can do about that
right
I can't kill the old leg because I've
got a I've got a new one that's running
and that it wasn't responsive when I
clicked on it very well I guess I'll
have to find it later
I think they'll figure out in five
minutes
that that's not working
um I can't give you a redo on the Sip
because that would be traveling back in
time but I'll give you a
I'll give you an interim sip
all right
so I'm going to call on this
whole uh half of the people who can't
hear an internal voice in their head I
don't think that's the thing now let me
tell you about a
um
story that's in the Wall Street Journal
not a story a opinion piece it was
written by a Roland Friar
who's a professor of Economics at
Harvard
so the two things you need to know about
them is he's a professor of Economics at
Harvard then the second thing you need
to know about him because it's the
context of the story is he had a black
grandmother now I don't know if his
parents were black but he seems to be
identifying with uh the black experience
at least somewhat
and in his article he talks about
studying for economics
obviously he had a top level education
because he was at Harvard and
and he was doing research to find out
how much discrimination and bigotry was
behind the differences in salaries
and what do you think he found out when
he kept looking for the reason that
there's a difference in salaries
it was completely explained by the skill
level
apparently the free market did exactly
what you expected
and and there was no indication of any
racism whatsoever the people had the
same skills
had the same pay
period
and and his article to his credit
his article was about how he was blinded
by confirmation bias
and that he couldn't even see his own
numbers like he was looking at his own
data and he was not believing it because
his grandmother had primed him that this
racism is everywhere all the time
he gave the story of his grandmother
once it was some cashier who handed
their money without wanting to touch her
and the grandmother interpreted that as
the cashier was such a racist
she didn't want to have accidental like
contact with a black person that was how
the grandmother interpreted it and then
the grandson wasn't so sure
he was like I think maybe she had a cold
and she didn't want to give you her
germs
so basically they had two completely
different worlds based on you know what
you were primed to believe so even with
that little bit of priming
uh Mr fryer got all the way to you know
to adulthood and he's still still
thought that the data would would agree
with you know his interpretation of the
world and it didn't
now here's here's the important part of
the story
most of you knew that right
is there anybody who didn't know that
the free market does make salaries
basically equal
I knew it I I think every one of you do
it here's what's interesting
somebody who identifies as black
I believe I don't want to over
characterize it but that seems how he
presented himself
um
he's got a major opinion piece in the
Wall Street Journal
he's got a economics degree from Harvard
I'm sorry duh I am completely I
mischaracterize him he was a professor
of Economics at Harvard
that's better than having a economics
degree at Harvard
I don't know where he got his degree
but if he's a professor of Economics at
Harvard that's even higher than being a
student of Economics right
so this is somebody who seriously knows
what he's talking about
and he got he got this opinion piece in
the Wall Street Journal you know one of
the big papers of record
and it looks like just a good opinion
like I don't think anybody's going to
attack him I don't think the newspaper
will be forced to retract it I feel like
Society has reached the point
where this opinion is now acceptable
what do you think
because it now agrees with observation
the data and the observation are now
aligned for at least some of the people
in the world
to me this data exactly matches
everything I've observed
to me I've never seen a I've never
observed directly
any salary difference for people have
different who have similar skills male
male female black white I've just never
seen it
so so maybe the world is getting past
that I will say however
that this doesn't help with the real
source of
of racial inequality which is the
schools
Because by the time you're an adult all
the damage is done isn't it
you know if you've got a bad lower
education you don't have the choice of
having equal skills and equal pay it's
just not an option because you didn't
get the the same the same boost when you
were a kid
so we still have to fix that
um I'll bet uh I'll bet Mr fryer would
agree with that
here's some good news the federal FCC is
going to ban new Telecom and
surveillance equipment made by Chinese
companies so they don't want to have
Chinese surveillance cameras in American
places
because they're worried that the Chinese
will maybe
possibly use those cameras to spy on
Americans or something
uh is there anything missing in this
story
something maybe they overlooked a little
bit uh maybe some related kind of story
well number one the you know Trump tried
to do this and got some resistance but
number two
uh Tick Tock is like
a gazillion cameras that are literally
in in citizens pockets
how do you say these other companies are
the risk and not tick tock Tick Tock
literally has a camera in every phone is
looking at you and listening to you and
making decisions and influencing you
this is a new close
the fact that we can ban these
companies I've never even heard of it's
a good idea I mean I'm solidly in favor
of banning them but
tick tocks that's okay
it's just it's absurd it's absurd but
good job I would say from all the way
back
um
to the Trump
Administration and I'll give the Biden
Administration credit for finishing the
job and and you know blocking these
companies but it's time to do Tick Tock
people
um
I I'm seeing apparently somebody asked
mosque if he gets if Twitter gets banned
on the Apple and Google App Stores
would he build his own phone and he said
yes
this is sort of uh that's a sort of
threat slash Bluff that only Elon Musk
can make
try to think of one other person in the
world
who could tell you that things don't
work out he'll make his own smartphone
and you would believe it
right Jeff Bezos tried it that didn't
work out but do you believe that Jeff
Bezos could make a real competitive
phone
well I don't know he's very capable
but wouldn't you trust Elon Musk to make
a smartphone in a way you wouldn't
necessarily trust anybody else
and what am I wrong I can't think of
anybody who would be more ideally
suited for making a smartphone
because he could pair it with neurolink
and he could pair it with his cars and
he could pair it with his uh his
satellites
and and here's something that Elon Musk
could do if he had a smartphone
and satellites so let's say a smartphone
goes through satellites
just think about this
someday
Elon Musk
could make a smartphone
that's the only one
that can make a long distance call
to Mars
that's like real
now it's real if he makes the phone
am I wrong
there's nothing technologically that
would stop you from making a phone call
to Mars except the time lag right
am I right yeah and so you'd say how are
you and yeah you'd have to wait half an
hour for a response
but you could sort of make a phone call
to Mars right like technologically
that's within the realm of ordinary
engineering yeah so I'm hearing people
say there's a 20 22 minute time lag
but if you send a voice message hey I
hope your trip to Mars was good you know
let me know you made it okay
20 minutes later ring yeah I made it
okay
isn't that oh and you could definitely
text
you could text Mars
how you do how's that how's it feel up
there pretty good 20 minutes later
all right
um
Jerry Jones
have I ever told you the famous people
have a history of being famous ever
since they were kids
there are some people who seem to be
around big events
like all of their life
yeah like famously Bill Clinton met John
F Kennedy when Clinton was a kid
I I don't feel like these are accidents
I feel like famous people
keep having famous experiences
just over and over again
so Jerry Jones it turns out
uh not to his credit when he was 15
years old was one of the white men or
boys I guess who blocked the uh
the North Little Rock High School in
Arkansas in Arkansas
uh 65 years ago
blocked it to prevent integration of the
school
so basically he was you know an overt
racist and he was participating in an
overtly racist
act that was not just overtly racist is
one of the most famous things that's
happened in the United States
now what are the odds that one of those
people
it was going to be Jerry Jones
or would go on to be you know somebody
who's a who's a common name
but when he was challenged about it I
guess the photo of him there just
surfaced he hasn't mentioned it before
then he never mentioned it which was a
good move
and I was interested in the way because
he's a very high functioning
successful entrepreneur right so he's
somebody you'd expect to be able to
handle something well
and I'll just tell you how he did handle
it you can judge whether this is
handling well first of all he didn't
defend it
he he said well gosh that was 65 years
ago
now that's good framing so the first
thing he says is gosh that's 65 years
ago
so that that was actually that that was
the best way
to start the conversation yeah that was
what 65 years ago because as soon as you
hear that
you get a little bit more flexible right
um and then he goes on to say that uh
you know it really reminds us that we've
come a long way
something like that and I thought well
that was pretty good because he's
admitting that that was not the way to
be and that we've come a long way and
he's glad that we have but he's not
running away from the fact that 65 years
ago he was that kid
which on some weird level I appreciate
it
I don't know why I mean I'm not agreeing
with a 15 year old kid I'm saying that I
appreciate he just owned it he just
owned it yep I did that
wish I hadn't done that now he stopped
short of saying you know I'm sorry I
wish I hadn't done it but it was sort of
there
like the the way that he dealt with it
the implication was that was some other
guy I'm not I don't even need to talk
about it
and I do
I do I'm very much on board with not
having to explain what you did when you
were 15.
I couldn't do it could you
could you defend your 15 year old self
I couldn't do it but I'll tell you how
the way I the way I would have handled
it I don't know if it's better
but let's say let's say I got accused of
some heinous activity when I was 15. and
then somebody says explain it today
here's how I would explain it
you know I don't like that guy either
that that 15 year old who did that thing
I hate that guy
that's it I agree with you yeah I don't
like him any more than you do
but I'm not going to defend I'm not not
going to defend somebody I'm not
I'll defend who I am today
but if you want me to defend my 15 year
old self no I'm on your side I don't
like that guy
and I would go further and here's The
High Ground
here's how you high ground that you say
I'll tell you my view and this is my
actual view so this is not this is not
like weird sophistry this is my actual
view that a life well lived
is we where you start very imperfect and
you try to improve
and that you do the best you can to
improve over the Arc of your life and I
would say we all started from a low
place
you've got a picture of my my starting
place the only thing I would defend is
where I went I'm not going to defend
where I started
and I'm not going to ask you to defend
where you started either I will ask you
to defend how you doing
how you doing
are you improving did you learn anything
are you the same person you were when
you were 15.
I hope not but I'm not going to hate you
for who you were when you were 15.
I'm not going to apologize it for it I'm
not going to explain it I'm just going
to say that was a different person same
as you were a different person when you
were 15. we don't need to explain that
person we are supposed to be better than
that person now
am I well I'll let you decide but that's
the only thing I'll defend is who I am
now and that's the only it's the only
standard I'll hold you to
see this helps too just to make sure
that you're not a hypocrite that's the
standard I'd hold you to I'm not going
to blame you for anything you did when
you were 15.
so
but uh
it's interesting and I do think this I
think the Jerry Jones story
is more positive than negative
because it shows the evolution of
thought
it shows the evolution of you know
America you can see it in one person
and I have no no reason to believe that
he thinks the same as he did back then
all right so I've seen yeah I've said
long ago that the Democrats were really
the party of women
but I'm seeing more people coming around
to this point of view because it's so
obvious at this point and uh I saw I saw
a tweet by Jason Andrews he says the
Democrat Party is America's ex-wife
the Democrat Party is America's ex-wife
have you ever have you ever heard a more
perfect summary
now here's what I believe
have I ever told you that everything is
about procreation
of course I have everything you do the
the clothes you choose to put on in the
morning how much you eat whether you
exercise the job you took where you live
all of your decisions
are based on your your procreation
Instinct right everything from sex to
success to just everything
you know it's all about procreation now
you don't think of it that way because
you're going through your life saying oh
I'm just you know rearranging my garage
but somehow it all it all ties back to
them
it makes sense that if there were ever
two parties see if see if you can follow
me on this I may be going too far right
yeah here's my overall thought if ever
there's a situation with two parties the
most predictable thing that would happen
is that one of them would become the
woman party and one would become the man
party
and that whenever you have a
civilization with two main parties
that's the most likely thing that will
happen because our most Basic Instinct
is
procreation
and the male and female strategies for
procreation are different so that should
cause that now
that's exactly what we see
in my opinion The Men Who were part of
the Democrat Party
some of it is just inertia you know your
parents were Democrats you're you're
Democrat but I think a lot of it is men
with different
um reproduction strategies
the men in the Democrat Party
believe their best chance of
reproduction is to make women happy
foreign
[Laughter]
which suggests that they'll eventually
all become Republicans
I've got a theory that there's a certain
amount of marriage that turns anybody
into a Republican
just a theory
I don't know how many years of marriage
it takes to turn you into a republican
but but it happens probably within five
uh what is what is the reproduction
strategy of Republican men
what is the reproduction strategy of
Republican men versus Democrat men I do
believe the Democrat male strategy is to
make women happy
and that they're and then they'll have a
name
and the Republican strategy is what
act like men
their strategy is to act like men
and then see if that works out for them
it turns out it does because when they
act like men
they attract a certain kind of woman who
wants somebody who acts like a man
right doesn't want somebody who agrees
with them all the time that's that's not
exactly reproduction material there
so
so in my opinion everything is explained
by that now as was also pointed out
teachers unions are like three-quarters
female the people who are doing Dei and
people work in human resources and you
know basically
most of the groups
they're active and really make a
difference in the country they're
female-run
and so it really has become a you know
male party versus a female party
abortion being most the clearest
distinction
if if you didn't know what the the issue
was let's say you you're an alien and
somebody said well you don't even know
what abortion is but we'll just tell you
this
there's one group that says we want it
as one group that says you know we don't
want that
is the group that says they want it most
likely the ones who are going to have it
yes it makes sense that women would want
options
if I were a man if I were a man
allegedly I'm male
if I were a man who could have a baby
I would want uh I would want
I would want abortion to be legal
not because I wanted to have one
but because I want more rights not fewer
every time you said Scott would you like
more rights or fewer rights well I don't
even know what the subject is but how
about more how about more rights I'll
always take more rights
now if you're saying to me but Scott you
would be killing children I'd say no no
I didn't say I would get an abortion I
didn't say that I would encourage you to
get one
I would say that every time you ask me
do you want to have more options or
fewer options
I generally default to more options and
I think people in general do people in
general want more options now fewer so
it makes sense to me that the the woman
party the Democrats would move toward
making giving themselves more options
and it makes sense that the the male
dominated party
Republicans would be less likely to do
that because to them it just looks like
murder
right
so you don't want to give somebody the
option of murder from their point of
view
but you could but you can sort of
predict everything that's going to
happen based on the mom and dad male and
female procreation model
now how much how seriously should you
take this
here's how seriously remember I told you
there are only two things you can know
the first thing you can know is that you
exist
because you're noodling with the
question of who you are
so there's something that exists you
just don't know what that is the second
thing that you can know is that it's
your impression
that some things are predictable
that's it you know science in particular
is more predictable than most people
but if that's all you know
and I and I give you the these various
models of predicting does follow the
money predict well
it does doesn't it
I don't know if it should but it seems
to
now here's the second thing does follow
procreation as the the dominant way of
understanding things to happen does that
predict
I think it does but I don't know if it
predicts as well as follow the money if
you ever got into a situation where it
was one or the other
I don't know
does abortion follow the money
sort of does
because if you say to people uh you're
going to have to have a baby that you
will financially support for 18 years
that's a pretty big expense you would
expect that people would say I would
like the option of not having that
expense
I would like the option of not having
that expense so even abortion
follows the money
it's it's a very good predictive way now
I don't know if there's a reason for it
or as a coincidence it seems doesn't
seem like a coincidence I mean you could
you could come up with an obvious reason
why money affects things
so but follow this
let's see if we can make a prediction
if the if the uh Democrat Party is the
woman
first party
would they nominate somebody like Joe
Biden to lead them
yes they would
because he's not a strong male figure at
the moment you know when he was younger
he was but at the moment he's not a
powerful male and they don't really like
powerful male figures they want somebody
who just looks like you know grandpa
will watch the kids when you have a date
night
so that's what Biden is Biden is
basically your grandparent parent who
watches the kids while you have a date
night he's very safe
and where uh whereas uh
Trump is you know scary to women all
right let's see what else you could
predict
based on that model is there any uh is
there any other thing that you could
predict
what about climate change
could you predict that Democrats would
be more concerned about it
uh
um maybe indirectly
um
no you're an idiot
orange out orange out you're out
so every time somebody imagines they
know what's in my mind
you get banned
stop imagining you could just ask it's
not like I don't tell you my opinion
I'm the last person who you should have
to try to read my mind
I literally tell you every thing
I think
you don't have to guess I'll give you my
reasons right
and and uh and to be clear
I'm not supporting Trump
for re-election
just just so you hear it as clearly as
possible could I change my mind
do you think I could change my mind
yeah absolutely
sure good
I'm just saying at the moment
it's not my choice at the moment
but you know I have to make real world
decisions as well
all right is there any prediction you
would make about
what prediction would you make based on
only the gender procreation model is
there anything you would predict based
on that
socialism
yeah I mean you would predict that the
Democrats would want more socialism
got in control yeah
yep
there was a story in the news of some
woman who was getting carjacked and she
just blew the head off of one of the
carjackers
and that the second one returned fire
and she got wounded but survived
and I thought
you know when you see women taking men's
heads off
well we're in a whole different world
but good for her
um
so uh Twitter amnesty is coming
so I guess musk has said he did a poll
and 72 percent said they wanted full
amnesty you heard my opinion that if you
were ever going to do full amnesty this
would be the one best time to do it
because then you don't say it's a
precedent you're just saying it's a Once
only new ownership
and you know if you get banned again
don't expect to come back it's a perfect
time to do it now will the will the
experiment work
do you think Twitter will become a hell
hole of you know racists and KKK and
everything else
I'm going to say a little bit
a little bit you know so some of the bad
people will come back and they'll
they'll test the system
the first thing some of the bad people
are going to do is what
they're going to try to get banned again
so they're going to say some just
to get banned again
just and they're going to push the the
envelope right so stuff will just get
banned again
and
um I would be happy if all Twitter did
was stick to its own guidelines for who
to ban next time
because those same people will disappear
if they violate Twitter terms of service
so I'm not really too afraid of it
is anybody worried about it
I I think there'll be a little uh
you know a little churn and turmoil
there for a little bit but yeah no big
deal
now
if you're saying to yourself
this is a good decision or a bad
decision which one is right
it's a good decision to bring them back
or it's a bad decision who's right go in
in the in the comments who's right
go
uh
how could you fool for how did you fall
for my trick
okay if I told you that's a trick
question
it's a trick question now answer it
again it's a trick question
oh come on
come on come on come on come on
oh I I totally primed you so that you
can't see it
so so I created a cognitive blindness in
you here's the cognitive blindness when
I tell you the real answer you're gonna
go oh how did I miss that this is
going to piss you off
now the real answer is he's a b testing
rapidly there's no right or it's not
it's not good or bad it's something he's
going to try if it doesn't work he can
immediately reverse it
if you're talking about whether it's a
good idea or a bad idea
you're not even on the right page you're
not even in the right conversation
the question is is testing it smart or
not smart
and for that there's not really much
debate of course testing it is smart of
course now if you test it and it doesn't
work
what would be the smarter thing to do
then
reverse it
reverse it okay or put in some rules
that you know gradually reverse it or
something so if you don't understand
that what he's doing is moving fast
breaking things and then adjusting
then you're missing the show
right the show is not the show is not
Elon Musk doing correct things
if you're looking for is that correct is
that incorrect you're missing the whole
show
the whole show is that he doesn't know
either
none of us know
nobody knows the right the right answer
he's he's finding out
you just put it out there completely
transparent here it is did that work oh
that didn't work I guess I'll do
something else
uh Scott waited for two years to speak
up against Force masking and lockdowns
jaina you stupid that's not true
completely false never been in favor of
mandates boom
stupid
all right
um by the way that's something I
couldn't say with full immunity before
do you know why I can call called my
trolls stupid and I don't get
knocked off a social media do you know
why
not because of Elon
no it's because I do it with respect
the reason I could call women stupid
 is the same reason I could call
men dicks
because I respect their full Humanity
like if you come at me
I'm not going to take it easy on you I
mean if it were a physical fight I'd
take it easy on you but I'm not going to
take it easy on you because you're a
woman
you don't get that not on not on Twitter
on Twitter it's just you
that's that's the whole conversation
all right
so uh what was I talking about oh the
Twitter anime state
so
um yeah it's just a good idea
to try it
we'll we'll find out later if it's a
good idea to keep them there but it's
definitely a good idea to try it
and all right let's talk about uh
that Mar-A-Lago situation and
um and uh Nick Fuentes and yay and
uh Milo
all right
so
in my opinion well first of all uh Trump
um responded he said he basically had a
good conversation with uh yay that went
well
according to Trump uh and that and and
just at the end of his statement he goes
and I didn't know who Nick Fuentes was
do you believe that
do you believe that the president didn't
know who Nick Fuentes was
I wouldn't have believed it except for
axios's reporting
so axios if you don't know they're not
in the bag for the left or the right
which is very unique people always ask
hey why can't you have a news source
that's neither bigoted left or bigoted
right we have one axios actually does
genuinely
I think
as follows where the news goes
and axios reports that some verbatims
from it and we do know from axios that
Trump was asking Nick Fuentes who he was
so if we know that that Trump asked him
who he was and even asked him if he was
represented the extreme part of his his
party you could see that Trump was
catching on
who he had at the table right if if
axios has the right reporting and they
do it before you make fun of axios go go
do your own research on that I think
you'll find out that there they play us
right
if I'm wrong let me know but I think
they try to place right
anyway if it's true that Trump was
asking who he was and asked him directly
if he represented the extreme part of
the party you can see that Trump was
working through it and they didn't know
exactly who he was
so I believe that I believe he didn't
know now do you think that Trump handled
it well
from your perspective
by saying he didn't know he was so
therefore
it's not exactly a big crime or a big
foul it was just dinner
do you think so for from the perspective
of Trump's base did he explain it
sufficiently
I think so
from from the perspective of a voter
that's kind of all you needed to know
wasn't it he wasn't invited
Trump uh trusted yay
Trump trusted a black man
which unfortunately is part of the story
right so so the whole story is that
Trump trusted the black guy
and that didn't work out for him
am I right
that's one way to is that not an
accurate interpretation
Trump's problem was he trusted a black
guy and he got screwed
am I wrong
now uh I don't think it's fair to call a
Kanye a black guy
because you you sort of
these sort of uh transcended race in a
lot of ways
um
but you could easily spin it that way to
me it looks like a black guy screwed
Trump
and I like Yay by the way but it looks
like he did that intentionally can't
tell I can't read his mind but it looks
intentional I mean from the outside
how's that look so it looks like a black
guy took Trump out or tried to
and Trump's just brushing it off because
now do you think people just forget this
story in two weeks so it doesn't really
matter
the base will
yeah the base will forget it in a day
but here's what you're forgetting
you're missing the biggest part of the
story
the biggest part of the story is it
doesn't matter what Trump's base thinks
it always did
but it doesn't now do you know why
do you know why it doesn't matter what
the bass thinks of trump
because the media already left him
so Breitbart went at him hard I don't
know if you noticed but Breitbart didn't
pull any punches it's just
Trump had dinner with a holocaust denier
and a famous anti-semite according to
Breitbart
right Fox News is shutting Trump out
so Fox News will not support him well
which means you know other uh Rupert
Murdoch assets will not support him
and
and now Breitbart is gone
Breitbart isn't coming back from that
like they're they're not going to call
them anti-sem items and then change
their minds I don't see that happening
do you believe do you believe Trump
could win without Fox News and without
Breitbart
yes or no
Trump could win without breitbarton
without Fox News
mostly yeses yet
there is a path there is a path
and the path would look like podcasts
only
so if Trump just said he won't do any
interviews with the major media and said
I'll just do I'll do all the podcasts
because Eddie if you say to yourself but
wait nobody's going to watch the podcast
because they're like low
low volume no they're not the podcasts
are much bigger than the network news
and anything that Trump does that's an
interesting interview will have greater
greater traffic than ABC News would
you don't think I could get more traffic
for a trump interview like if I
personally interviewed him on a podcast
you don't think I would get more clicks
than ABC News would get on the story
about Trump
I would yeah I would get more I would
get more attention than ABC News just
telling a story about him so he does
have a path
and there would be plenty of podcasters
who would who would want to you know to
benefit from the traffic so they do it
he could start his own he could start
his own network
he could start his own network you know
just a channel on YouTube and or Rumble
I guess and uh
and you can just interview other people
imagine Trump running for office just
imagine this
imagine Trump running for office but he
doesn't do any interviews
he only interviews other people
and that's his campaign
think about it
he doesn't do interviews he only
interviews experts and Democrats who
disagree with him
and that's it and maybe some rhinos who
disagree with it
can you imagine how much you would like
to watch Trump
interview his critics
seriously could you could you avoid
watching that
oh my God
oh my God
like it would be so watchable it would
just blow everything else out of the
water and and as soon as you heard and
by the way here's a little trick a
little trick for you for publicity
this is the most important trick for
getting publicity
nobody cares that you did something well
you can't get publicity because you did
something really well I did a good job
right unless it's like extraordinary
here's how you get publicity you do
something that other people have been
doing forever
but you do it a different way that looks
like it could work
that's what Trump could do
you could say well the first time I ran
for office I just did every media
interview and it was different than the
way other people did it I just sucked
all the energy out of the room nobody
ever did that before
now he could say all right I'm going to
do a brand new way again
and the brand new way is I'm going to
suck all the energy out of the major
platforms and just starve them
and just make my show the only thing
that's interesting on TV because it
would be
nothing else would look interesting if
you did that he would immediately like
make everything else boring
he has that power
now
what if he doesn't do that
suppose he decides to be the the Trump
of the last several years and he says
I'm just going to go out there and do my
thing and I'll do my rallies I'll uh
I'll post things on true social I'll
accept interviews when they're offered
and I'll just do it the straight way can
he win
I don't think so because because you
don't realize the extent to which
opinions are assigned to the public
it's easy for you to say you know I'm
never going to change my mind because
the media changed my mind
I'm not going to change my mind because
somebody else had a different opinion
but that's not how it works
your minds are changed every day by the
media
if the most
influential people on the right
decide not to back Trump
they have enough influence to you know
take 25 percent of his support away
which makes him not viable
so it doesn't matter what his base
thinks it matters what the people who
influence the base thinks and I think
they've abandoned them
I think they've abandoned him
so
um I mean I have
yeah like I said he could win me back
like I can imagine that but at the
moment he's not offering me something I
can support
so I don't think that without the most
influential voices and it's not always
not always the people with the biggest
audience right there are some people who
are just influential
cernovich would be again my Universal
analogy like every example there's
there's like a sort of a jungle to it I
don't know why there's like everything
has that musk angle or a sort of a
jungle but cernovich is you know not
pro-chomp at the moment
and how much impact does he have
a lot a lot you might not notice it you
might not know how he does it you might
not you know track his influence through
other people but a lot
Now by himself does that make a
difference maybe not
but there are enough other people who
are let's say good influencers
who are pulling out
yeah uh certain eventually referred to
himself as a a humble mom blogger which
is one of the funniest things I've seen
he's a mom blogger now you know he's a
stay-at-home dad I guess I'm not sure if
that's the right term but he's he's with
his kids during the day most of the time
and okay
I've always loved
how much do you love the fact that he
had three daughters
that's just the simulation
talking to him isn't it
what are the odds of having three
daughters 12 percent
by doing the math right
I thought he had three
wait he has two daughters of the son
oh he's the newest one the son
oh I did not even know that
okay
well there you go
two daughters in the sun Kind of Perfect
oh good you know I love I love following
even though he's a mom blogger as he
calls himself uh his mom blogging is
actually good blogging like or good
posting you know I follow him on
Instagram and Twitter I like I like the
personal stuff as much as I like his
political stuff
all right uh
somebody says he's a good writer that's
true he's a good persuasive writer
all right what else is going on here
let's see
um how many of you have seen the Netflix
series ancient apocalypse
yeah Netflix series ancient apocalypse
I recommend it
so here's my uh strong recommendation
for super entertaining series
um that's the first this is the first
series I've binge watched
I'm actually carried my iPad with me
from room to room because I couldn't
stop watching it now
here the basic idea of the show is that
there are a number of
um
uh let's see ancient
ruins this suggest that everybody
learned from some kind of smart prior
civilization that was destroyed after
the Ice Age so let me say it better the
Graham Hancock I guess is the journalist
who is delving into let's say the
archaeological domain and he's getting a
lot of pushback because he's not an
archaeologist but he put on a good show
in terms of the production quality of
the show it's really really good he
takes you into all these ruins that are
not are way better than ruins because
you're learning stuff
that wasn't obvious to you but the idea
is that there must have been something
like an Atlantis
and that there there were let's say
building techniques and
um how to be had to be Farmers that was
known to some Advanced civilization and
then the Ice Age and some major
apocalypse happened and that wiped out
most of the smart people
but some of them must have survived and
were like missionaries that went to
other civilizations and taught them the
secrets of building monoliths and moving
big rocks and how to how to do farming
instead of huntering and Gathering now
those of you who watched it did you find
his thesis persuasive
just the people who watched it did you
find his and were you persuaded
all right saying well wall of yeses
um see mostly yeses but some knows some
knows
okay
um
here's what you need to know about
documentaries
number one
documentary is the lowest level of
credibility of all media
did you know that
if you had to pick one thing to not
believe it should be a documentary
documentaries are not designed to give
you both sides they are designed
to mislead you into thinking that the
thesis is the only thing that matters
do you think they show the other side
half of the content of this series was
the journalist talking about how he
keeps being criticized by you know
traditional archaeologists and that
they're closed-minded and they refuse to
accept other Alternatives you know what
you didn't see
what you didn't see is his critics in
their own words telling you what they
disagree with
did you notice
did you notice there was only one side
of the story if you were convinced
that's true
because you watched that documentary you
you're missing one of the most important
things to know about how the world works
the documentary is the lowest of all
forms of credibility there's nothing
lower than that it's the number one
least reliable information that is
produced by Humanity
now you might say to yourself Scott
Scott Scott fake news is worse than that
no it isn't it's not even close
fake news has a competing
news business so if you want you can
look at the fake news and you can see
the other argument you can make your own
decision and the other argument isn't
hidden that much even within our bubbles
you know you can just turn on Fox news
or CNN and see the other side right
but if you watch a documentary are you
going to go do your own research
probably not probably not now if you
don't believe me that a documentary is
the least credible
type of content
uh how many of the 2000 mules have you
seen lately
2 000 mules not one of them came forward
not one of them caught on film
it was a very very convincing
documentary wasn't it
is an example not an analogy examples
are good
analogies are bad
so if I give you several examples of
where a documentary was convincing but
doesn't seem to have been proven
all right now let's say that you you're
not convinced by that one you think that
that 2000 mules maybe it's still to come
out and it might be could be now I'm not
saying that all documentaries are
incorrect I'm not saying that
surely some documentaries are totally
correct I'm saying that you can't tell
the difference
so if you can't tell the difference
it's the lowest level of credibility at
the highest level of persuasion because
they've got you for like an hour if I
can persuade you on anything and make
you pay attention for an hour I will
convince you
getting you to pay attention for an hour
is the hard part if I can get that then
the convincing is the easy part
so
I would say there were many signals of
low credibility in the um in the
presentation
many many signals of low credibility and
mostly the dog not barking situation you
know the thing that you expect to hear
you're like okay you brushed over that
pretty quickly you know that sort of
thing
so I found it completely non-credible
and I agree with them
and both and that's not inconsistent
I believe his argument was just filled
with things that I'm like I don't know
about that that's a little sketchy but
his main point was this
that there may have been higher
technology back during the uh the Ice
Age
and that we lost the trail like we don't
understand why people were built there's
at least one site in his films
in the series I guess there's at least
one site where everybody seems to agree
that they had the building techniques
somewhere closer to the Ice Age like 9
000 years ago or something or 12 000
years ago
um
and that we don't know why they knew it
that long ago that was a surprise to
archaeologists now
if somebody knew that stuff 12 000 years
ago
and then there was a big disruption
which also people agree with
so the two things that he doesn't have
push back on I think
is that there was that knowledge that
somebody had at least one civilization
had the knowledge
12 000 years ago and then there was this
long period and then suddenly suddenly
farming just like sprung up in one
little era
and all of all these groups seem to have
a An Origin myth about
um some kind of smart strangers who knew
how to do things that came came from the
sea and then taught them things and then
went away
like missionaries yeah and there does
seem to be some evidence that there was
a massive flood
so it could be that the stories of Noah
you know maybe are based on Ancient
stories that actually had something to
them so here's what I believe I believe
it's very likely
there were more advanced civilizations
and that some members of them shared
their knowledge and so it did make some
hunter-gatherers
kind of quickly evolve
I think that's likely
because I don't think we know much about
the past
I think we know about like five percent
of the past that's about it so could
lots lots be hiding in the 95 percent
yeah sure but what are the odds that
you know what are the odds that the
exact era that you know your humans were
in was the good one
probably it was good and then it got bad
maybe it got good again in terms of
civilization
that wouldn't be surprising at all so I
think his basic idea that there was
something that may or may not have been
called Atlantis that may or may not have
been an advanced civilization is proven
because they found it
they didn't find Atlantis but they found
a place with building construction that
was thousands of years ahead
of of what happened later
so I think the case is made I just don't
think I think he added a lot more
speculation than
maybe I would have
yeah so I think his basic theme sounds
pretty solid but a lot of the specific
details he forced into it now what did
the media say about it
can you guess just a wild guess without
looking don't do any Googling what do
you think the critics said about it
other than whether it's true or false
but beyond whether it's true or false
what do you think the critics said about
it
super racist
do you know why
because those smart strangers
from that advanced civilization
were a little bit too white
so apparently the various myths about
these smart strangers
they were not browned
the the smart strangers were not were
not super brown
like nobody apparently nobody has a a
story where like a black guy showed up
and taught them how to farm and build
stuff and then left
but several of them have like a
mysterious you know often they're Giants
they're tall and stuff but they they
feel a little
not brown enough for what would make
sense for the time
so so apparently it's all just a racist
yeah they're all bearded men who weren't
Brown enough
um what do you think of this story
you're seeing all over the internet but
not in the major news of uh these weird
rubber-like clots and people who uh got
the vaccination and then died from some
reason or other
have you seen those you see the doctors
like they're taking the blood clots out
of the veins and like it's clearly
something you've never seen before it's
almost like like an alien was in the
body
have you seen that you've seen that
right
how many of you believe that this is a
real thing and that there are massive
discoveries of rubber-like blockages in
people's bodies
I I saw a doctor on Twitter uh debunked
this in one sentence
and then I never thought about it again
do you want to hear the one sentence
here's the one sentence debunked I don't
know if it's true
by the way I don't know if the debunk is
true but here's the one sentence from an
actual doctor
um
every doctor knows that dead people's uh
blood looks like that
that's exactly what a dead person's
blood will look like is all like this
rubbery cloudy stuff so basically it's
just every dead person
just the way it looks right
now
I don't know if that's true
but that would be the only reason it's
not in the major news right you only see
it on Twitter and then you know smaller
Publications yeah the reason it's not in
the major news is it would only take one
doctor to say well that's the way it's
supposed to look it always looks like
that
yeah I don't think I don't think the
videos where the doctor is taking those
are not I don't think those are real
I don't know why they exist but I don't
think it's based on anything real
so even kim.com
famous internet
guy he believes that this should be
looked into
because he saw a documentary called died
suddenly how many of you watched the
documentary called died suddenly I guess
that's where this claim is made
and I'll bet if you watch the
documentary you were completely
convinced it was true right
because you saw it in a documentary
I'll bet if I watched the documentary it
would look completely convincing
so I'm not going to watch the
documentary
because do you know what you've learned
if you watch a documentary that's
completely persuasive
nothing nothing
yeah if you watch a documentary there's
lots of facts and it's very persuasive
you've learned nothing
nothing
documentaries are not to teach you
the truth
they're they're giving you a narrative
and that's what they do
so if you if you accepted the narrative
that was presented in a documentary
you're not doing a good job of being a a
good consumer of information
right if you haven't seen the whatever
is the debunk
how hard would it be to debunk that
all right let's do a live experiment so
I haven't done this yet but if you uh
here's a good thing to do if there's
anything in the news that looks sketchy
type that thing into a Google search
followed by the word debunk
and you'll find it I'm going to do that
so this is called uh died suddenly
died
suddenly
and I'm going to say blood clots
blood
clots what do you think I'm going to
find
and then debunked do you think that
there will be a real good debunk from a
doctor saying that this is
what do you think
make your prediction because I haven't
done this I've never done this so I'm
going to find out the same time you do
uh Forbes debunks it
uh let's see BBC
all right
um did embalmers find vaccine-induced
blood clots
so here's affection
now I'm not saying that the person fact
checking this is necessarily believable
either
um so it goes let me just skim it
yeah that these blood clots exist
uh they say it's fake news uh number
fact number one embalmers do not conduct
autopsies
and Bobbers do not know vaccination
status well I don't know they might have
asked it
most of his data is not linked to
vaccinations blood clots are common in
refrigerated bodies there it is there it
is blood clots are common in
refrigerated bodies that's the whole
story
right now if you didn't know
that I could Google this in one minute
and find the debunk
yeah the rubbery ones right
if you didn't know that the debunk would
pop up that easily
then maybe you learned not to trust
documentaries
right now I want to be really clear what
I'm telling you
I'm not telling you that vaccinations
are safe
that's not what I'm saying
how would I know the only thing I know
for sure is I don't trust any
information about vaccinations now I
don't not the plot not the pro not the
con I just don't trust any of it so I
don't know so I'm not even sure I have a
like
I just don't have a dog in that race at
the moment either way it goes if I could
find out for sure I would accept it
right I wouldn't have cognitive
dissonance because if you told me the
vaccinations were hurting people I'd say
well not totally surprising
so that there's no trigger for cognitive
distance if you told me that they
actually work great
I would say
excellent not totally surprising
so neither of those would trigger me I'm
I'm open to both possibilities
so when I tell you that the debunk
exists what I'm talking about is The
credibility of documentaries
the only point I want to make here is
Stop Believing documentaries
can I ask you to do that I'm going to
ask you directly I'll just ask you
please
stop trusting documentaries now they
might raise really important issues and
they might be totally right
I'm not saying every documentary is
wrong I'm saying that you can't trust
them because they were persuasive
if you say I believe it's true because I
saw a really persuasive documentary
you're talking like a crazy person
stop doing that
I watched a documentary means you've
been misled
get that right I watched a documentary
almost certainly 95 of the time that
means you've been misled by a
professional misleader
it's what they do
all right
um
and uh Rob Reiner
I love Rob Ryder because he gets every
story wrong
it is like uh I don't know you're some
kind of a symbol for the left that's
perfect every time like he captures
everything about the left
so he tweeted uh
uh he tweeted uh Nick Fuentes is an
unabashed anti-semitic Holocaust denier
Donald Trump invited him over for dinner
enough said
he didn't invite him to dinner
he gets everything wrong right if he had
invited him to dinner it would be a
different story
like very different right if he had
invited him
then I'd say well that really does tell
you everything you need to know
but of course he didn't invite him like
that wasn't even the fact
uh but as I tweeted it doesn't really
matter if if Trump invited him or not
because it's like the Charlottesville
fine people hoax now has a life of its
own
and if you think that Trump can
continually flirt with
uh you know being on the edge of being
anti-semitic without actually being
anti-semitic because I don't believe he
is if you think if you think that he'll
have enough support to win the
presidency
in that strategy
I don't see it I can't see it happening
but could be surprised you never know
if uh Trump came up with a good Sentinel
plan or even if he ate it
all bets are off
no bets are off so we'll probably have
uh 300 uh
situations that tell us my God this
changes everything before 2024 and then
we'll find out it didn't change
everything because there'll be another
one tomorrow that changes everything
all right
um
according to timcast Nick came with Milo
and Milo is the person yeah
does that change anything
I mean if if Nick came with Milo
you don't think he was a that Nick was
brought along to destroy Trump
does anybody think that now let's say it
was Milo who did the invitation
and made it happen and brought Nick
Fuentes
you don't think that Milo is smart
enough to know that that would destroy
Trump
of course he is
he's not a beginner
Milo didn't start politics you know this
week
he kind of knows how this stuff works
he's very experienced yeah of course he
did so if you imagine that that was
accidental like do you think that Milo
or yay who knows what yay was thinking I
mean he might not even known who who
Nick Fuentes was but we don't know but
don't you think Milo knew exactly what
he was doing
yay may or may not have known who Nick
Fuentes was probably did but I don't
know
but certainly Milo knew right
yeah
so
I mean some of this is more about you
know maybe the individuals than it is
about a big story
all right that ladies and gentlemen
concludes
the planned part of my broadcast
I'm going to go private over our locals
we're going to close it down just for
the subscribers
for a few minutes but I'm going to say
goodbye to YouTube
for now I'll talk to you tomorrow
