wrap up
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
probably the best thing that's ever
happened to you in your life it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and it's here
it's here yeah good news and all you
need to make this a special day is a cup
of burger glass of tiger Chelsea
starting the canteen Jugger flask of
essel Olympic eyed fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous epidemics
now go
ah
very good
what a good way to start the day with
all of you
I could not be happier
um is it just me
or does it feel like
there's something about the the mental
health of the country
that's rapidly improving for reasons
that I'm not entirely clear about
does it feel like that to you I I feel
very much like we reached Peak wokeness
and everything now is you know it used
to be just a a one-way March toward
greater wokeness and we all had to go to
jail if we didn't like it or get
canceled but now it seems as though
between the Supreme Court and you know
just getting tired of things and maybe
seeing things more clearly than we used
to I feel like we've reached the peak
and it has started to reverse
and what it feels like is some kind of
weird sanity breaking out
it feels like sanity does anybody have
that feeling
that there's something like common sense
is starting to emerge from the miasma
I don't know it might be it might be
entirely a sort of an individual
experience of what news I'm reading or
whatever now it could be because the
news over the summer
is Never Real News
all the summer news is just recreational
news
so we're going to treat it as Recreation
with the assumption that almost none of
it is true or at least true in total you
know all context considered
so let's look at the stories let's have
some fun with the news which is purely
recreational because everything is going
in the right direction the economy
pretty much everything is going in the
right direction maybe slightly maybe a
lot
but pretty much everything's going in
the right direction it's kind of a weird
time you don't expect it all right
here's what's happening
how many times have I told you there's a
new breakthrough in batteries
as I mentioned that ever before
like every two weeks there's a new
breakthrough there's some company that's
got a new battery breakthrough well
here's one
apparently you could use rust
for creating electricity and storing in
the battery
and then you can reverse the rust and
turn it back into its original metal
and then you can reverse it again and
that gives you the ability to charge up
the battery and and then use the power
now apparently long ago years ago
somebody discovered that rust or
something that's like rust I think Russ
is not exactly what it is but it's rust
adjacent
and
it was good historian good restoring
energy
and it was good as storing it in a let's
say gradual release way which is the
best you want for the grid but they were
too heavy too heavy was it iron Mustang
iron huh they were too heavy
so they didn't make sense for
automobiles or phones or anything like
that but if what you're building is a
permanent battery for your grid it
doesn't really matter too much how heavy
it is because it's just going to sit
there forever
so it turns out it might be is it lead
or is it I don't know what kind of metal
it was but it but they rusted and
reverse the rust anyway it's supposedly
the ideal
technology for
the grid so that's good news
all right
uh you knew there was going to be a
story about Don Jr right did everybody
see that coming let's see the news is
filled with allegations about Hunter
Biden and the cocaid at the White House
what's what do we think will happen this
week oh yeah oh yeah there'll be a story
about
uh don Jr
it's it's horrible folks I hate to break
it to you this terrible terrible uh
story about Don Jr oh my God he really
but according to Aubry O'Day a uh sexy
blonde woman who must be famous for
something that I'm not aware of
she said that she once had sex with Don
Jr in a gay uh gay club bathroom
so ah
that's
I don't know
you got uh one doing cocaine in the
White House another ones boinking a hot
woman in a gay nightclub
so of course I had to check the comments
on Twitter
to see what people would say about that
[Laughter]
all right somebody beat me to the joke
somebody asked if it meant that Don Jr
was gay
this was somebody about you know wait a
minute he had sex with a hot woman in
the bathroom with a gay nightclub
I wonder if he's gay
that was the best comment I saw
now I'm thinking to myself this is just
me because I you know I have a boy brain
so I can only really think like a guy I
can't really turn that off and I read
this story and I'm thinking to myself
seriously
Don Juju went to a gay nightclub and got
laid
oh come on
first song first song Give it up for the
first sub whoa
all right
Don Jr
you go
you go don Judah
I suppose that's the terrible story
about Don Jr that we're supposed to feel
bad about or something uh distract us a
little bit but
um
I think Don Jr has won the first Sun
competition
fairly cleanly
fairly cleanly I think
all right
uh you might be aware that the Supreme
Court ruled uh that the government can't
coerce social media platforms to limit
Free Speech because that would just be
an extension of a government limiting
Free Speech even though it's the free
market
so so now we're in good shape right
thank goodness thank goodness for the
Supreme Court huh yeah we have that
problem of maybe the
you know maybe this platforms were
biased
um by the government and so the Supreme
Court's fixed that forever so we'll
never have a problem again with bias
problem solved
oh
uh my next story
is that do you know what happens when
Twitter tries to be unbiased
and stops censoring things
well it turns out that Facebook starts
up a competitor
a competitor
it's called threads and it launched I
guess yesterday last night
and it's a Twitter knockoff
but it's by facebook slash meta slash
Instagram and people are saying it'll
you know it has a good chance because
the Instagram Community will just be
moved over if you want to optionally I
guess so you can move your followers
over to it
a number of people tried it had you know
huge uptick you know tens I think 10
million people signed up pretty quickly
uh Etc now
um
here's my question for you
do you think the threads would have
happened
if if Zuckerberg if musk had not bought
Twitter
does threads look like a good business
play or does it look like somebody who
is screwing his shareholders probably
the meta shareholders do you think the
meta shareholders would like to clone
the only social network
well it's not the only one Snapchat
doesn't make money but Twitter doesn't
make money
does Facebook know that Twitter doesn't
make money
so their their idea is to make half a
Twitter like one that doesn't have you
know the right mix of people to fight
so they've created basically a Democrat
Twitter
which guarantees that neither the
Democrat Twitter nor the Republican
Twitter if you know if such a thing
happens and it just bifurcates neither
of them will have any energy neither
could they be profitable
to me it looks like Zuckerberg is using
the shareholders money for political
purposes
am I wrong
does this look like a business
um decision
does it look like Zuckerberg just
thought huh what would be a good product
in the free market well Twitter isn't
making any money
yeah why don't we make something that's
just like that
I cannot there's no part of me that
thinks that's a business decision
do you think it is
do you think that Zuckerberg believes
that that's how he could make money
I don't think so I think this is purely
Zuckerberg being a good Democrat you
know probably doing things that he
thinks are good for the country I'm not
saying he has bad intentions I'm saying
that he probably thinks it's good for
the country and
shareholders be damned this is why I
don't own stock in meta
because this is the sort of behavior
that I'm not looking for in a company
I'm investing in like I definitely
wouldn't want them to be doing this that
doesn't look like the right business
move but button there it is
the first I guess the first to thread if
you call it that was from Zuckerberg
himself and he said I quote let's do
this welcome to threads let's do this
now the story does not mention whether
or not he was playing uh white boy air
guitar when he said it but I believe
that that goes better with air guitar
let me see it let me see I'll give you
the two let's do it welcome to threads
kind of just lays there doesn't it but
let me let's just take this up to full
full uh
boring white guy level
air guitar
let's do this
right so much better
Zuckerberg needs some help
in the air guitar that that just should
have been part of it all right
so that's happening
um I saw a tweet by Donald luskin who's
a good follow on Twitter you should
follow him
he points out that
if it's not bad enough to have a guy
named blinken negotiating for us in
China
that's right our negotiator is blinking
just no no the simulation is just
messing with us now but uh now it turns
out that Hunter Biden's new lawyer who
happens to be a GOP operative is named
riggleman
riggleman a lawyer named riggleman
now I think riggleman should be working
on Election security don't you
yeah I want I want a lawyer named
riggleman working on Election Integrity
just because
don't you
come on we all want that
all right Rasmussen did a little poll
about what people think about that
cocaine and the White House
uh
and 58 of likely U.S voters think it is
likely the president was involved in
Hunter's foreign business deals
oh so it's more about the performed
business deals
um
so so a majority pretty solid majority
think that the president was involved in
Hunters business deals
now
are you surprised that anybody who still
pretends
that they think he wasn't
do you think they're uninformed or is
this recreational belief
where for fun you pretend that you're on
the other side yeah I know he had
nothing to do with it
it doesn't feel like a real opinion does
it like I could understand if people are
just
um you know uninformed but the
uninformed usually are smart enough to
say they don't know when they get pulled
uh
but really or could there really be that
many Democrats who actually believe that
the dad was unaware
it doesn't even seem possible I guess
anything's possible but it feels it
feels recreational
it doesn't feel like a real opinion
maybe none of our opinions are real
maybe mine are not real either but this
one seems extra not real
all right well by now you've probably
all seen the Press reports uh in which
uh Hunter Biden's new attorney riggleman
denied that the cocaine found in the
White House was uh was Hunters
did you all see that
did you see the press release where
Hunter denied it was his oh it didn't
happen oh no you didn't see it because
it didn't happen
now if you were Hunter Biden and you'd
been accused of
much bad behavior which apparently was
true
don't you think that right near the top
of the things you would do in this
situation if that if that cocaine were
not yours
wouldn't wouldn't the first thing you do
really near the top of the first things
you do in the morning when you woke up
is call your lawyer and say can you just
put on a boring press release that just
says you know I had nothing to do with
it
just put it out there
where's that
now I do understand that if it had been
his cocaine
it might be a bad play to deny it you
know just just let it play out for a
while but what if it's what if he knows
for sure it's not his
how do you play it if you know it's not
yours if you know it do you stay silent
is that how you play it if you know it's
yours or if you know it's not yours and
the news is saying it might be or social
media is saying it maybe
so you just stay silent in that
situation right
Hunter Biden went to law school too
isn't he actually a lawyer
and he's got a lawyer and he works in
government so he's surrounded by experts
and yeah advisors and staffers who can
tell you exactly the right thing to do
you know what the right thing to do
would be
if it's not his
the right thing to do
is to say it's not yours
it's not really hard is it now of course
people might say he's lying or whatever
but
it's the easiest thing to say that
wasn't mine
how hard is that
but it's not there it's missing the dog
is simply not barking not only is the
dog not barking but you had to wait for
me
to tell you that
did CNN say where's the denial the CNN
say we've contacted him he won't comment
do you remember that story where they
tried to get a comment and you wouldn't
comment or they couldn't find him
or they couldn't find anybody who could
find him they couldn't find his lawyer
couldn't get any comment whatsoever do
you remember when they reported that the
hunter said no comment no you don't
because I never reported that they
didn't report they tried to reach him
they didn't report what he said they
didn't report where he is they didn't
report they talked to his lawyer
nothing
and we all just sat here where our
thumbs up her asses acting like that was
normal oh that's normal
all right
what else
um
now what about the fingerprints
at least law enforcement has told us
that that the baggie didn't have any
fingerprints on it so at least we know
that right what what oh we haven't heard
that's right we haven't heard not only
if the fingerprints identify anybody but
we haven't even heard if they tried to
get any
don't you think that law enforcement
would say we have some prints
or alternately they would say we checked
for Prince and then finally
wouldn't you expect that to be in the
news
the single most obvious thing the single
most obvious part well DNA
could you get DNA off of just somebody
touching a baggie
all right I don't know if you can I did
hear from a fingerprint expert this is
what I love about social media
of all things there's somebody who's a
fingerprint expert who's one of my
followers
and the fingerprint expert said that
getting a print off a plastic bag a
baggie is actually close to Impossible
did you know that
did you know it's really hard to get a
print off a plastic bag do you know how
I knew it
not from the news
did you see it on CNN nope did CNN ever
say you know it'd be hard to get a print
off a plastic bag if it is I mean I
heard it from one person who sounded
like an expert
how about Fox News even Fox News didn't
report it that it's hard to get a print
off a baggie or or that it's easy tell
us it's easy it's hard we could
definitely get some DNA we can't get
some DNA might get a fingerprint might
not might be partial
you might belong to other people you
don't know right
everything about this story is just
missing
everything that matters about the story
is just missing the only thing that I'm
surprised they told us is that it tested
out as a drug
that's the only thing I'm surprised
about
all right
um
uh I don't know why this story is out of
order I've got an out of order story
I'll have to get back to
but uh you I don't know if you saw that
the daily wire featured one of my tweets
on this issue
um so Politico had a headline yesterday
that said White House cocaine culprit
unlikely to be found
law enforcement says
now
how in the world is that unlikely
how in the world is that unlikely unless
unless
Hunter's not saying it isn't his
nobody's talking about DNA or
fingerprints and they're completely
silent about uh about surveillance on
video cams in that area or even what
area it was
but still Politico is feeling some
confidence in this headline White House
cocaine culprit unlikely to be found now
what type of persuasion is that because
this is obviously propaganda narrative
what type of so the I call it softening
up the room
softening up the room basically people
can get used to anything
if they just get exposed to it a lot so
what you don't want is you know to to go
down the line and then someday find out
that you can't figure out who it is
you want people to say right ahead I
don't know this is one of those
situations where I think it would be
unlikely we'd figure out who the real
culprit was very unlikely yeah so that
so then a year from now when in fact we
don't know who it was or at least it's
not reported
we can say yeah that's sort of what
everybody expected you know the experts
told us we're not going to find out who
it is
pure propaganda
so a number of people called called the
mail for it I was one of them the daily
wire
uh
printed my tweet in which I said we can
now accurately predict all future
headlines here's one we all knew was
coming and it was the headline about
White House cocaine culprit unlikely to
be found
didn't every one of you know that the
headline was coming
is there anybody here who didn't know
for sure that there would be headlines
saying that I don't know we just can't
find the uh Epstein client oh did I say
absolutely I'm sorry I meant a whole
different story yeah no we will never be
able to find the
you just knew it was going to go this
way
now
don't you think that the entire uh White
House security operations should be
fired
if it's true that there was no video
surveillance in a part of the in part of
the White House
they couldn't they couldn't even tell
from the are you telling me they
couldn't even tell from the hallway
cameras who entered the room couldn't
even tell who entered the room right
because there's no surveillance in there
come on come on the entire they would
all be fired by now if they didn't
already know who this was
all right
I would like to add my own conspiracy
theory to the mix I don't believe I've
heard this one yet
so will you do me some fact checking and
tell me if you've seen this on social
media or any pundit
the most likely person or entities that
would leave that cocaine in the white
house would be
go
the most likely person to leave that bag
of cocaine would be most likely
most likely staffers
this is zelensky Don Jr reporters
yeah so if it had been if it had been
left accidentally
if it had been left accidentally you'd
probably think of staffers
yeah I would think that Hunter
is maybe not in the
not at the very top of my suspect list
it'd be around number three
you know just my personal Judgment of
things
but there could be lots of people
all right here's uh here's my
this might actually change the headlines
so I'm a little hesitant to say it you
ready for this
it looks like an intelligence operation
to me
there's nothing there's nothing that
screams uh law enforcement or
intelligence operation like planting
drugs
planting drugs is sort of like
you know operation it's like it's like
the first lesson isn't it what is more
basic than planting drugs somewhere
I can't think of anything yeah maybe
taking some naughty pictures of somebody
having sex that they don't know about
it's like the most basic thing
so ask yourself this
how badly does the uh deep State want
Biden to willingly get out of the race
how much do the real people of power
whoever they might be let's call them
the Deep State how much do even the
Democrats
want Biden to leave so they have a
chance a better chance of winning
a lot
do you think it could be a GOP operative
just somebody who had access to the
White House and just took it out of
their pocket shoved it on the Shelf
and said when they find this that's the
end of the bidens
because ask yourself this
Hunter Biden you know the story is
Hunter Biden is back in the White House
you know after being sort of out of the
news his plea deal is the news and then
he's back in the White House what are
the odds what are the odds that Hunter
is the one who put it there
really now isn't that a little bit too
on the nose
don't we know the hunter is somebody
that forgets things like laptops all
over the place a little on the nose huh
happens to be cocaine just happens to be
Hunters preferred drug and he's a guy
who leaves things in places and he's
just been in the news and and and then
suddenly
he brings cocaine to the White House
isn't that is that a little bit exactly
on the nose
all right I'm going to go for
a fake story
I say it's not hunters and it's not a
staffer and it was not left there
accidentally
not Hunters not anybody else leaving it
accidentally it is not accidental
now is everybody else said that
have you heard that speculation anywhere
else because I haven't seen it anywhere
else
anybody else
all right so you haven't seen that
before
now you tell me that that's not the most
likely scenario
compare these two scenarios
if if you wanted hunter Biden and the
bidens to go down
that this would be the entire amount of
effort it would take to take them down
let's say you're just a bad person you
had access to the White House this is
your entire
that's it and the entire Administration
is gone you reach into your pocket
you stand in front of the you maybe you
know where the security camera is you
know maybe even though where it is
[Music]
so you just take it out of your pocket
you slip it into the cubby hole or
wherever they found it
literally reaching your pocket and you
end the Biden Administration
that's it
literally reach into your pocket
push something on a shelf or wherever
the hell it was
that's the end of the Bible
Administration
you don't think that there's anybody who
thought of that
it would be the perfect op
it would be the perfect up
now the only person the one the one
person or entity that I'm going to rule
out
I'm going to rule out
Ukraine
Ukraine I think likes Biden I would rule
out the military industrial complex
because they like Biden they like them
spending money on Ukraine
so if the military industrial complex
overlaps with the Deep state
than it wasn't them
because the the Deep state in the
military industrial complex probably
wants Biden in there now unless they
figured out here's the other possibility
the other possibility is that the Deep
State and the military-industrial
complex are working together and they
know that Biden even though Biden was
perfectly their guy for spending money
he might be declining so much and they
know more than you know
so the people closest to them you know
the the Spooks the CIA they have a much
better idea whether Biden can make it
another year to the election
they know
all right you and I don't know
necessarily we're guessing but they know
so they would know his exact medical
condition they would know that when we
don't see Biden he's in bad shape they
would know what drug they give him
before he goes up in public if there is
one right so they would have a much more
dire opinion of Biden than we do
because they could see her first
we the public are getting you know just
these little glimpses that are
horrifying but imagine the stuff we
don't see
right the stuff we see Biden tried to do
in public is horrifying like his lack of
cognitive ability imagine what that
looks like privately
just imagine what he looks like when
he's not at his best
when they haven't you know made sure
that he can get of his good tenement of
speech and go off the stage it must be
scary behind the scenes
so
one one possibility is it was a
diabolical Republican
who just had access to the White House
and stuff that there or or bribed the
cleaning crew to put it there there's a
million ways he could get there but the
other possibility is that the Deep state
has decided that Biden cannot represent
them it's just he's too far gone and
they need a chance of winning and they
need to take him out soon so that
Newsome can slot in there and keep the
money rolling for Ukraine
so
having now heard this hypothesis it's
just a hypothesis
How likely does it seem to you that it
was planted
go have I convinced anybody How likely
there was planted we don't know we
wouldn't know who but How likely it was
planted I'm seeing a lot of zeros and
25s interesting
the 25 you're probably joking but
I know would you take cocaine out of
your pocket if you were in the White
House
would you would you take it out of your
pocket
and if you took it out of your pocket
you used it wouldn't it be the highest
priority you were thinking about to not
get caught and you know you look around
your space before you left
I know it's possible
that a druggie could leave some drugs
it's very possible druggies forget stuff
they leave drugs Hunter is a perfect
example but if you compare the odds of
that happening at the exact time all
right all right here's a better way to
say it if you said to me Scott there was
one time over the course of the
four-year Administration the hunter left
some cocaine and now at White House I
would say the odds of that pretty good
pretty good
but if you say to me that over that
four-year term just this one week where
Hunter the story was that Hunters back
in the White House just that one week
that's the week
that he left right after his plea deal
that's the week he's going to leave a
bag of cocaine in the White House
you you could accept that coincidence
because that coincidence is galactic in
size you know that right that's like a
one in thousand
so I think there's a one in one thousand
chance it's a coincidence
so it wouldn't be unusual for him to
leave a bag of drugs we all agree with
that right if I said four years
has has hunter ever left a drug in the
white house most of you would probably
say maybe like good chance at least once
but then I narrowed that four down four
years down to that one week the one
worst time it could have happened no
worse time than this one week and that's
a week he did it right
sorry
sorry
two on the news
I think it was I think it was uh planted
boom
all right
um I would not let's say I'll put a
let me put a percentage confidence on
that um sixty percent
60 percent
40 it's just um personally dropped some
drugs yeah 40 is something completely
ordinary
sixty percent that's too much of a
coincidence
too much of a coincidence
uh Coke addicts do it for what no I'm
not
I'm not saying the hunter only did one
week of Coke
did you hear that no we assume that
addicts are addicts
it's like you've never heard of an
addict an addict is something you always
could do Coke no matter how long they've
not been doing it that's what an addict
is somebody who's
just sort of reflexively can drop into
that without much effort
all right so it could be exactly what
happened so uh let me say clearly it
could be Hunters wheat it could be
Hunter's Coke
could be somebody else's
I just think there's a slightly more
chance that that coincidence is not a
coincidence you know you have to believe
in a lot of coincidence for that for
that to be the case
all right um
where is pagosian so today finally CNN
and Reuters and others Wall Street
Journal have decided that now they can
say hey
I thought we would have seen a picture
of him in Belarus by now
and then the Belarusian leader louchenko
finally said directly he's not in
Belarus
said it directly he's not in Belarus he
thought he might be in Saint Petersburg
unless he's already gone to Moscow
yeah because I'm sure that pagosian
would feel feel pretty safe in Moscow
would be it would be
no he's not I don't know if he's dead
because Putin needs him alive to find
out who the other plotters were so part
of the story is there are lots of
plotters now
the reason I do this live stream besides
the fun of it which is maybe the biggest
reason is
that I like to make predictions
especially predictions that are not
being made by the others
and then you you judge the quality of my
live streams or you should
by how often I get a prediction right
tell me who else said the progosian did
not go to Belarus name one of the person
name one other person in the entire
world in let's say who does this does a
public kind of thing not one
person yeah okay uh Jack probably was on
it early I'll give you that
all right so
so finally
finally the mainstream media caught up
to guy on Twitter who just looks at and
says well obviously obviously Putin
can't let him go
he's got to keep him until he finds out
who the other Traders are of course
that's just basic dictatoring
like that's the most that's got to be
like dictator 101.
first you get a hold of your critic and
then you find out what else the critic
knows that you need to know and then you
kill them it's like just basic it's the
most basic dictatoring you could do I'll
tell you what you don't do lucenko is
funny luchenko said it's ridiculous to
imagine that Putin would want to get
revenge on pregosian for just trying to
kill him and take over the country
I mean what Putin Putin's not kind of a
revengeful guy I mean what history do we
have of Putin ever trying to attack a
Critic
[Laughter]
it's just funny listening to the uh you
know the uh what would you call
leishenko uh listening to the puppets
talk
it's so it's hilariously implausible
anything they say
you know even more so than American
politics just hilariously implausible
all right so
um
so just remember this story right
remember the part where Scott
who has zero military or geopolitical
experience you'd all agree right no
military experience no geopolitical
experience but I'm the only one who got
that right
and it's not the first time I'm the only
one who got some things right now I'm
saying this partly to brag because it's
useful for telling people why they
should watch the show
but it's going to tie into a point
that's upcoming so just put a little uh
put a little tack in that
that I got a few things right okay
that'll come back later
all right let's talk about uh Ukraine
uh what did I predict
is happening in with the counter
offensive do you remember what I said
was going to happen with the
counter-offensive
I said the war is already over
because nobody's going anywhere
there's no there's there's not going to
be much land that's traded after this
point unless it's by negotiation
uh I I said the war is over we're into
the hard negotiation that happens to
involve killing each other but no
neither neither side can win
the the winning is just off the table so
the news is finally caught up to me
now have I mentioned that I have no
military experience I think I did just a
minute ago yeah no military experience
but I told you weeks ago there's no war
they're basically in in place and
they're just waiting for a Republican
president or something
but it's not really going to change any
you know no leadership looks like it's
going to change no property looks like
it's much going to change and that's
what the news is reporting so the news
has caught up with me and they're saying
uh looks like a stalemate
the the Russians did too good a job at
digging in the ukrainians of course say
they don't have the weapons they need
blah blah blah all right so I saw a
tweet by David sacks uh again if you
don't follow David Sachs on Twitter
you're missing a lot
because he's got some good contrary
intakes contrarian against the let's say
the military-industrial complex
the contrarian against them so he notes
that there's this kernel in the
Australian Armed Forces Who's involved
in the Ukrainian stuff and he makes
three points the offensive has failed
so that's from somebody was there
somebody on our side you know NATO
says the offensive has failed
not that it's just starting not that
we're seeing the beginning not that if
they keep pushing it'll be good it just
failed
so
basically according to this Colonel who
is involved
it failed
now of course zelinski saying we're just
getting started so zelensi is sort of
like that night in you know Monty Python
after his arms and legs get caught up
get caught off come on here I'm just
getting started
number two uh this is from the remember
this is from somebody in NATO NATO
military tactics do not work against
Russian defenses
what
well wait what
that's exactly what uh Sachs tweeted
wait what
doesn't that get your attention
NATO tactics don't work against Russian
defenses
at least on the ground
wow
um and then number three the colonel
expects limited successes along the
front line but no major breakthroughs
none
no break no breakthroughs just mine are
a little you know block AIR block there
so we're now at exactly the place that I
told you we would be
how many of you would be willing to say
I predicted that correctly
right again the the context is not just
my ego which I love you know if anybody
wants to say I did well I like that
everybody likes compliments everybody
likes to be right but a larger purpose
here is I want to show you that
non-experts can be right
would would you buy the do you buy at
this point especially after the pandemic
do you buy the notion that non-experts
can completely beat the experts and
routinely it's not even unusual and it's
not something limited to me
I know you can agree with that right I'm
not the one person who did it better
than the experts I'm one of many people
who did better than the experts many of
us that's the bigger story it's not
about me right the bigger stories of the
experts are garbage
so after David sacks tweets this
pointing out that it was this colonel in
the Australian oh I'm sorry I kept
saying Australian Austrian
so correct correct everything we said
it's Austrian not Australian
Austrian Armed Forces uh which would
explain why is it NATO
makes a lot more sense now if you get
rid of the Australian party it makes a
little more sense wait is Australia NATO
Wall Street is not NATO what Australia
is
do me do me some quick fact checking
um neither is somebody says neither
well somehow this kernel is involved in
Subway so I guess I don't know the
details but he sounds like he knows what
he's talking about
so after uh David sax makes this tweet
in which he's literally quoting this
colonel
uh somebody named akikako tweets back
and replies to David Saxon he goes and
I'd like to do this with as much
attitude as the Tweet seems to have so
to get the right attitude
I'd like to invite
Dale to join us
Dale could you read the Tweet by eki
kako
glad to do it
uh
David uh no Dale could you more
condescending
we need lots of condescensing
got it got it
all right how about this
David I am curious to learn
about your extensive military background
and the comprehensive range of your
military experience
[Laughter]
could you kindly share with with me the
specific details the specific details
and noteworthy aspects of your time
serving in the military
Bingo zing zing Gollum
to which my uh response was
there's still people who believe the
experts
let's form a contest and the contest
will be this it'll be a Betting Forum
for things in the future
all right it's a Betting Forum and you
only get two bets
two possibilities you either bet that
the military industrial complexes tell
you the truth on some specific issue or
you bet that David sacks has a more
accurate take
and and there's lots of different
iterations lots of different bets
now I'm not going to say that David
Sachs will be right on every take nobody
is
but do you really think he's not killing
the experts
he's been destroying the experts
just that one person he's been
destroying the experts on a whole bunch
of stuff it's not just the Ukraine war
he's been more right than people have a
right to be right about anything
how do people not notice
how do you not notice that there's
somebody who's just right all the time
just like consistently right and the
experts are like whoa
it's a weird world all right
um you were probably aware that until
the Supreme Court's more recent rulings
that the Supreme Court would be an issue
in the 2024 election because of abortion
and a Rover suede
and you think that'll still be fresh and
the Democrats will make a big deal about
it because they did in you know in their
prior election so we kind of expect that
but uh so a good warning I think it was
in the Wall Street Journal an opinion
piece that
uh the Democrats better be careful if
they take on the Supreme Court because
the Supreme Court's vote on affirmative
action
is actually popular like the majority of
the country agrees with the Supreme
Court
and the ruling on student loan relief is
also favored by a majority that you know
not doing it and more to the point the
people who are most against student loan
forgiveness were older public the you
know part of the public that's older
and they're more likely to vote
so it turns out that the uh abortion
issue I think is going to get a little
bit stale by 2024.
because
the Republicans have the ultimate answer
to that
we we kicked it to the states so it's
closer to you the individual
you want the decision to be as close to
the individual as possible
and while we certainly have opinions
about what should and should not be
legal we think the federal government
should get out of it so you're not
really arguing about abortion
you're arguing about whether you should
make the decision close to the public or
farther from the public
that's our only point so this would be
the Republican take the only thing we're
asking is that you get more involved in
your own decisions
get more involved in your own life
that's what we're asking we're asking
that you don't let the federal
government make decisions that you
shouldn't be making make it as close to
your local government as you can and
then you're going to feel the most
comfortable with it and and people will
get different answers in different
states now that's a pretty good defense
right I haven't heard any Republicans
say it the way I said it they do say it
but they don't say it cleanly and I mean
it's just they don't package it well
um but it's a perfect defense
because it actually gives people more of
what they want instead of less or at
least you can you know you you can
phrase it like that
you know you can still have your
abortion
you might have to live to might have to
move to a state where people agree with
you
but if you live in a state where the
people around you don't want it
is that our problem
is that the federal government's problem
that your neighbors don't like abortion
it's a pretty easy sell that you need to
work it out at the state level and that
that that's all the Supreme Court did in
my opinion that is all they did I I
don't think they ruled on abortion
whatsoever
they just they just said whose authority
it was so
I do think that the Supreme Court which
I thought was going to be the biggest
problem for Republicans might have
actually reversed in terms of its uh
its impact if the Republicans
can let's say elegantly handle the
abortion question and they should
because it's right there I mean it's
right there for them to take it's free
money it's just sitting on the table you
just have to pick it up
don't tell us what you think about a
fetus
do not care the best thing that Trump
could say about this or let's say any
Republican is uh why do you care about
my opinion about abortion
I care about your opinion about abortion
oh that's good
 that's good
imagine you're being president you say
why do you care about my opinion of
abortion you should care about yours
because that's what I care about I care
about your opinion about abortion I'm
not going to have a baby
oh look at me
I'm not gonna have a baby but you might
your opinion on abortion is critical and
vital to me my opinion on abortion
should be zero interest to you from the
federal government
work it out at the state
isn't that strong
now that that's you know sort of
political narrative persuasionally I
mean it's not based on truth per se it's
just persuasion
but you would love any politician who
said stop asking my opinion about your
body
yeah oh that's even better oh my God
that's even better stop asking my
opinion about your body
that's the end of it
that would end the debate
stop asking my opinion about your body
wow
yeah and I dropped a few mics didn't it
that is really strong is it let me let
me just pause here and ask you in my
mind that sounded like insanely strong
did you feel it
did you feel that is persuasive
not really some yes some no
now persuasion of course doesn't need to
get you all
right it doesn't work that way you're
only trying to pick off the five percent
that might be persuadable
women never forget rights taken
yeah well that's certainly certainly the
pro-abortion people are going to phrase
it as a right taken away
but I think it's too easy to
to answer that
that it's a right that's driven down to
you
I'm giving you more control over your
rights
yeah all right that is what Trump has
been saying he I don't think he says as
well as I said it
all right
um
let me give you an update on global
warming
uh there are two things happening with
global warming at the same time and
these are both confirmed uh the plan is
getting warmer and the planet is cooling
off
confirmed
so there are two things I know for sure
is that the planet is getting warmer and
also colder at the same time and I know
that because of data
so I've looked into it I've done a deep
dive I've checked the data and as of
today the Wall Street Journal which is
not noted for his left-leaning Politics
the Wall Street Journal is reporting
that we reached a new Global high in
temperature
it's a new high
and things are getting warmer all over
the world
if you go to Twitter
and just put it in climate change you'll
find very credible people telling you
exactly the opposite and they'll show
you data
and they'll even show you official data
they'll show you data from the people
who claim that
climate change is an emergency they'll
use their own data and they'll say here
it is it's not true
and then other people will look at I
guess the same data and say there it is
it's true
yeah so I have no idea
I don't even know how you figure it out
how do you know it's true
I don't know
so I'll just re this is maybe the most
dangerous thing for the planet is that
we can't tell
now I happen to think that no matter how
true or natural it is we're going to do
all the same things
meaning that we're gonna you know the
free market
still rewards people if they came up
with a better form of energy or even
just a good enough form of energy that
you could sell a lot of it so the free
market should be doing everything it
needs to do to come up with Alternative
forms of energy and it seems like it is
so probably will be fine
whether whether it's actually getting
warm like warmer like the Wall Street
General reports today or is not as
people all over social media like to
tell you
we're going to do the same stuff
probably doesn't make any difference at
all
because we're so good at remediating
um
against you know extremes everything
from extreme heat to extreme of
everything else we're really good at it
I think well I think we'll survive
all right DeSantis
um campaign made a I think a big gaff
you tell me
um so DeSantis
tweeted I guess uh his campaign tweeted
an anti-lgbt
um
well what they tried to do desensis
tried to make Trump look like uh
he was two pro-lgbtq
right De Santos retweeted a mean
political ad
that that tried to paint Trump as a bad
person for being too supportive of lgbtq
that actually happened in American
politics
that really happened
oh my God
that's such a mistake
you know
um
Trump has lived in the sort of a
Hollywood
celebrity world for most of his adult
life
if you know anything about the Hollywood
you know famous rich people life
you know it is just full of lgbtq people
I would guess that Trump is very
comfortable certainly the way he talks
about it is very comfortable with the
LGBT community
and is fully supportive of them having a
you know full and free quality life
so going against Trump on this issue is
maybe the dumbest thing I've ever seen
like I get that there are you know some
anti-lgbtq people and maybe they'll say
yeah DeSantis really goes after him but
if you tell me that you're going to pick
the campaign who's going after going
after a segment of Americans
what
that doesn't work for me
no no it's one thing to say you know
Progressive politics are crazy it's one
thing to say to say AOC is crazy or you
know the politicians you can call them
crazy that's fine but you don't go after
you don't go after a segment of the
American public
how does that make sense how do you win
an election doing that that that's pure
Hillary that's like Hillary Department
you know well we got these deplorables
wait what
what you just called a bunch of
law-abiding Americans deplorable
did they break any laws did they violate
your Constitution
did they poop on your lawn
no you don't do that if you're running
for president if you're president
everybody's cool that's got to be that's
just got to be the base everybody's cool
if you're if you're following the law
yeah we have different opinions about
law should be but everybody was
following the law you're all cool
anything beyond that is just up
that's just up
so I think descent has probably just
destroyed his chances with that
I don't know what chances yet now would
it be uh surprising for you to learn
that Rama Swami is picking up uh polling
Steam
so remember Rama Swami was polling at
like about nothing close to two percent
I think in the beginning two or three
percent and uh DeSantis was around 20
percent
well it depends what pole you're looking
at and I don't see the name of this poll
but uh allegedly according to the hill
um DeSantis is down from 20 to 16 and
Rama Swami is up to
10.
that's right
whose campaign is working
for Vegas so Vivek is is first of all
taking uh strong positions on stuff like
fentanyl very strong but the the
brilliant thing he's doing is he's going
into the enemy's cave and walking out
with their scalps
he's walking into CNN and he walks he
walks out and he holds up his scalp
and then somebody else invites him in
and he walks out with a scalp
is
is really effective so he's not afraid
of the hardest argument
he's going into the darkest caves and
he's walking out with a scalp he's doing
it one time after another and after a
while you can't ignore it right if he
does it once he got lucky
if he keeps doing it
if he keeps doing it you can't ignore
that that that's and I don't really see
him generating what I would call gaffes
or let's say reasons to not like him I
mean if you don't like his policies
that's fair game
but he's not giving you a reason to
dislike him
and other politicians do they give you
reason to dislike them he doesn't do
that he just tells you what he thinks
will work
he takes the role of a patriot the very
best kind you know
so he's impressing the hell out of me
Will he win we'll see anything could
happen he does have a path
his path is to slightly pull it out of
DeSantis which looks doable believe it
or not actually looks doable he's within
uh stretching distance
and if he if he can get into something
like a legitimate second place race with
DeSantis
and then let's say something happens
with Trump
because when you talk about Trump
something happens is guaranteed
do you think Trump is going to have no
shocks or scandals or be taken out of
context again of course he will the the
Press will make up a new story about
Trump and it will be devastating like
all the old stories they made up about
him and Vivek will just be sort of you
know unscathed
because they're not going to put enough
attention on him
so he might be just the only
um unscathed Republican at some point
if that point is the right point
he goes all the way
so he does have a path I mean it's
narrow it's very narrow so it depends
entirely upon Trump so his fate is his
own against DeSantis yeah that's the
best way to say it so if Vivek can
completely control his fate against the
other candidates
he has complete control of that he does
not have control over whether he could
be Trump trump would have to take
himself out or the Democrats would have
to finally succeed
but he's going to be the strongest one
who's just sitting there waiting
potentially now DeSantis is going to get
a lot of heat from the lgbtq and and
other places and so he might be he might
look a little damaged
and I don't think he could beat viveka
in a in a debate
because DeSantis is a pleading voice
I've talked about this and Vivek is a
commanding voice and I don't mean the
quality the the sound of the voice I
mean the way they present
uh DeSantis is complaining and then
telling you he'll fix it and descent and
Vivek also you know calls out the issues
but it's more of a commanding you know
I'm going to do this we'll do this
kind of thing
so I think Vivek would beat DeSantis in
a straight up debate
but you know I I I've been saying this a
lot but I like to just remind you every
now and then because it's really easy to
get down on your country real easy
um but just think about the fact
that we have a Vivek DeSantis
yeah RFK Jr Trump
you know Biden I think you know he's
passed his expiration date so it's not
about him being a Democrat or not
because you know RFK Jr is a Democrat
but when I see those three characters
being you know serious contenders for
the race
I say I think we'll be okay
like America can still feel that level
of talent for the top office and to me
that's a really high level of talent
whoever wins you know if one of those if
one of that group wins
I don't I just feel like the country's
in good shape even if you don't like
some of the policies
so uh DeSantis also decided
um that he that Florida will not or I
guess the state decided but DeSantis is
probably behind it that there are five
states that Florida will not accept
their driver's license of their state
so if you came to Florida from Delaware
Connecticut Hawaii Rhode Island or
Vermont you wouldn't be able to rent a
car
do you know why
I believe the end the reason is that
these five states give driver's license
to illegal immigrants
and desensis is saying if you're going
to give licenses to illegals and that
license allows them to get services
my state doesn't give services to
illegals so if you're going to certify
that these illegals have driver's
licenses we're going to ban your state
you can't have a driver's license in
their estate now
all right so somebody's saying free
money
I get that it's popular
however
that would that would be a good move as
a what
that would be a good move as a
Governor yeah that's the problem
he just screwed five states that he's
running for governor
let me say it again in one week DeSantis
insulted the LGBT community in five
states
five states
there's five states that can't have a
driver's license or or can't legally
drive in Florida
not good not good so no matter what you
think about how smart that is as a
governor
as a presidential candidate it's just a
that's just self-immolating to me it's
the most ridiculously bad idea I've ever
seen ever seen in my whole life no
that's not true it's not the worst idea
I've ever seen but this is very
governor-like and that's the wrong Vibe
I don't I don't want a governor vibe
from my president
foreign
and the thing I said I was going to get
back to you was yeah my favorite story
of the day
a lot of good ones today but my favorite
is there's a a Twitter user I'll call my
user but he's a political troll called
David leave it I think that's pronounced
and he was complaining to musk and
Twitter that somebody had called him the
c word
it rhymes with runt
but it starts with a c and you were
saying that you couldn't believe that
Twitter would allow somebody's to stay
on the platform after using such an
insult
and it took about uh oh about a minute
for somebody to produce a November tweet
from David livett in which he called
somebody a runt but with a C
but with a c that's right
so my advice to you
is you should always check your past
tweets before you take a stand
don't take a stand if you don't know
what you've tweeted in the past
it sounds like a drunk tweet you're
right
but uh
I think my theme for today is
everything's moving in the right
direction
further proof that everything's moving
in the right direction on Twitter you
can use the c word
now I'm not going to use it here because
I only use it in anger
I like to save it you don't want to you
don't want to use its energy in just
talking about it that would be a waste
of it you want to keep it fresh
okay that was a terrible
ah no don't
Retreat Retreat go back reverse reverse
reverse no I didn't say that I didn't
say keep it fresh I'm going to say you
want to keep it powerful you don't want
to drain the energy out of it you want
to keep it powerful not fresh
powerful
fresh would be good too I'm not saying
it shouldn't be fresh
keep it fresh if you can I'm just saying
that my point was about the energy
you want to keep that energy in there in
case you need it so once again
I'm right about percussion
I'm right about everything
I'm having a good week a big write about
everything
wokeness is disappearing
um you may have noticed that I'm slowly
being rehabilitated from
one of my disgraced cartoonists you see
it in small ways so for the daily wire
to feature my tweet
it would suggest that the daily wire is
not afraid of me
because you know that they were they
were mentioning it in the same sense as
other
standard what they would call
right-leaning pundits
uh how many shows in a row what
so uh everything's going well
um
can I believe
the experts
they got nothing on us
no they got nothing on us
all right YouTube
uh thanks for joining
fun day today I'm sure it'll be fun
tomorrow I love this summer news summer
news is the best
and I will talk to you tomorrow
