oh
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to any
of you
no not you
not you but the rest of you
yeah
every one of you sexier happier feeling
better and let's talk about your
immunity response morale
am i right yeah it's peaking and it's
going to get even better and all you
need is a copper bug or a glass of tank
or gels just died a canteen joker flask
of vessel
what kind any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
mean hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
if you don't believe it just watch this
go
yeah
nailed it
nailed it
can you feel the goodness surging
through your body yet
might take a while for some of you
because of the distance
but i think uh i think most of you are
feeling it now tingle
anybody
anybody a tingle hair standing up in the
back of your neck anybody anybody
good that's exactly how it should feel
well let's get to the important news uh
thanks to saul of united for alerting me
to this news
according to sky news uh there's a pig
that has learned to paint
the the pig actually picks up paint
brushes with its little
snout pig nose
and walks over to a canvas and starts
painting away
abstract painting and we'll go back and
get other paint brushes and apparently
it taught itself
watch somebody paint and it learned to
paint just by watching
uh of course they are naming the pig
that paints
pig casso
pig casso
which is a good name for pig and they
actually sold a painting for uh 20 000
pounds
20 000 pounds
which coincidentally
is exactly what the pig weighs 20 no not
really but wouldn't it be funny if it
sold it for the same amount that it
weighed in american talk
but here's what i
thought about this when i saw this story
does anybody know if hunter biden has a
pet
does hunter biden already have a cat or
a dog or something
because i have this crazy idea
hunter
you don't have to get this pig because
if there's one pig that can paint
almost certainly there are other
painting pigs
am i right if there's one pig that can
paint
they're going to be more it's not going
to be like the one painting pick so i
think hunter needs to find himself a pig
teach it to paint uh you'd automatically
get a higher price for the paintings as
long as you put that by name on it and
he could offload much of the work
which i understand is grueling
grueling
so hunter biden you need to get a
pig that can paint i'm looking for a pig
that can write comics
um
but you know the search goes on i'm
thinking
i might need a lemur
more than a pig
i think i need the fine hand
coordination there
all right uh how do you like it when i
tell you that i was wrong about
something
how much do you like that
what what if it's something that i sort
of made a big deal about
and i found out i was totally wrong
would you like that
would you enjoy
watching me
eat my words
because that's what's going to happen
oh here's the bad news it's going to
happen to you too
turns out this is going to be a shared
experience folks
are you ready to find out how you got
fooled
same way i did
you know that video of charlamine de god
talking to i'm not sure if i'm saying
his name right i don't mean to say it
wrong
talking to kamala harris
and do you remember what a what an
absolute train wreck that was you saw
the clip right you saw it with your own
eyes
you heard it with your own ears
that was a train wreck am i right
absolute train wreck i mean embarrassing
really
for the vice president
except
i saw an opinion on twitter
that was the opposite of that
that she really nailed it
and i thought
what
what
and i thought you know this is just the
usual
people take inside situation and they
must know that she didn't nail it right
they must they saw the same thing i saw
same thing you saw so you couldn't
really watch that
and say oh nailed it
don't get ahead of me
no get ahead of me mark
that's part of the story
um but it's not the whole story
so
yeah so that's the whole story right uh
there was and then i saw a
comment from kathy gordon
who
so again saw a completely different side
of it but does i don't think she
associates with the left
so i thought wait a minute
what the hell did i just watch
i thought how could you possibly have a
different opinion about that
so i
fired up the clip again
to watch it again
and it was a different clip
rupard
rupard hard
and you all got rupard too
here's what you missed
if you watch just the embarrassing clip
it's it's just embarrassing
i i think anybody who saw
only that might have had a similar
experience
but here's the part you didn't see
you didn't see her ramping up
she was just getting up to speed and she
she stumbled
in my opinion she didn't she didn't
start out well but she ramped up
and she just nailed him
now i don't think that she landed a blow
but what she did was for a fairly
extended period
she ranted at him in a
uh slapping him down to his level way
and
here's the thing i missed
i completely missed this
she didn't cackle once
she didn't giggle
it was actually a powerful performance
if you don't see it clipped
ah
i saw a clip
my entire opinion was based on a rupaur
edit
they did it to me again no matter
no matter how
aware you are that this is a normal mode
of the news now it still gets you
like i would consider myself
pretty high on the
you know the awareness scale of fake
news
i mean i talk about it every day how
much more aware can you be
and i totally felt for that
totally fell for that if you watch it
again
this is actually the kamala harris
that made me predict that she would go
far and actually get the nomination
now that didn't happen she failed
terribly in the uh the primaries but uh
i saw her her performance as a senator
i forget who she was grilling kavanaugh
or somebody i don't know and i thought
to myself wow she looks like she can
really
you know come with it when she needs to
but then she turned into this sort of
giggly
uh caricature of i don't know what
and and all of her gravitas was was just
wasted
and
um
and this video completely
fooled me it was just like the covington
kids things that i also fell for for 24
hours
now
let me give you the standard which i
would like you to judge me
by which you should judge me ideally
that would be my preference
but it's a standard that i will judge
you
by all right
so let me tell you how i judge all of
you
meaning people
not by mistakes
because that would just be exhausting we
all make mistakes like you know what
kind of world would that be we're all
just
you know banging on each other for our
mistakes because we're continually doing
things suboptimally
you don't need them all to be pointed
out
but
how you respond to your
mistakes is definitely something that i
think is worthy of judging
did you learn anything
did you at least admit it
so
um
yeah i think my i think that was a case
of my bias blinding me but also just
forgetting
that if i missed the whole context it
could completely reverse the meaning
now
if you're a democrat and you watch this
happen to me
do you ever ask yourself i wonder if
that's happened to me on any other topic
where where if you just saw the whole
video
it would it would actually reverse
your impression it wouldn't just modify
it a little bit it would actually just
turn it backwards
like to find people hoax like the
drinking bleach oaks like the covington
kid hoax like the over feeding the koi
fish hoax they were all the same
you just cut off the beginning or the
end or both and you can reverse the
meeting well ted cruz and uh
representative swalwell eric swalwell
had a little exchange today
of note
both for its persuasion quality and for
its
drama
so here's the setup
ted cruz apparently has some position
where he can
hold up ambassador nominations that
biden wants and he was going to use that
power to negotiate to get
chuck schumer to agree to put it to a
vote
a separate uh topic
that uh
about the nord stream 2 pipeline from
russia to germany
now cruz was just asking for it to go up
to a vote right he wasn't saying the
vote has to be a certain way
he said let's just vote can we vote
sort of what they do for a living and he
was holding up the other normal business
which is
ambassador appointments or approvals i
guess nominations i guess
and
so swalwell gets in it and he goes
i like it when people use these forms
that are just so hackneyed now i use
them too i'm sure i'll do this again but
he goes this period is period not period
democracy period ted cruz is in the
minority and most members of the
minority want our ambassadors confirmed
what the hell do you call a system where
one person can bring diplomacy to a halt
says eric's wall
ted cruz responds to him with his own
tweet in which he says
hush child the adults are working
okay
here's what i have to say about this
this was either a really good persuasion
play
or it was a really risky one that paid
off
i don't know
if ted cruz knew in advance he was going
to get this deal done but he did
so so the the punchline is
that soon after this exchange
uh schumer and cruz reached a deal
just like two adults negotiating for
something right so
and it was actually a reasonable deal
where both people could get something
that i think the public would look at
and say yeah that looks pretty
reasonable from the from the perspective
of the public yeah let's get some
ambassadors
and let's also have a vote on something
that's
up for a vote
what what's to disagree about that
so the public is served
and sure enough
uh ted cruz's framing of swalwell as a
child interfering with the work of
adults
he pretty much delivered that didn't he
he delivered the work of adults within
24 hours of telling swalwell that to
stay at the children's table
now here's my question to you
did cruz know he was going to succeed
because you know the old lawyer thing
about never asking a question in court
unless you already know the answer
i feel as if cruz probably knew he was
going to get this done
from either early indications or private
conversations or whatever
so
uh
i'd like to think
that because cruz is very smart right
he's very good at this stuff i'd like to
think that he knew he was going to get
this done and so framing
swalwell this way is just a like a
devastating
reframe
so i love this
anyway
my only lesson on here is that if you
make
that kind of a reframe
reframing somebody as a child
you have to deliver
and you better do it pretty quickly and
he did he did so he you know he gets the
full benefit
all right here's the word the weirdest
thing about the world and communications
and and my place in it right now and
believe me there's a lot of weird things
in the world
so for the for this to be the weirdest
so you probably know that uh china has a
number of i don't know what you'd call
them spies or operatives or trolls or
whatever and uh humorously
twitter labels them so if one of them
tweets at you it's actually labeled
labeled a
state state sponsored entity or
something like that chinese
so you know you're talking to somebody
who has a government approved role to
mess with us on twitter and if you're
one of the bigger accounts you know you
have a lot of followers you're pretty
good pretty much going to run into one
of these chinese operatives so the one
that i don't know if he's assigned to me
or just volunteered or whatever i've
talked about it before chen
chen uh very smart highly educated guy
and he's so good at his job
that
i can't i can't dislike him
because you know he's in a situation
he's doing his job right
so he's supposed to persuade me
and you know
essentially parrot the chinese view
but as long as he's there
i figure i can use him right
is there anything anything preventing me
from using him to
uh
to promote my own messages i don't think
so as long as he's there
so i tweeted at him
um yesterday and i said
wow
how
i'm not intentionally mispronouncing his
name i just can't do it right
i said can you tell us if china ever
shut down the main fentanyl suppliers in
china the united states gave you his
identity that's that's true we actually
sent the identity of their main fentanyl
dealer to china so they can shut him
down
have you heard about him getting shut
down
nope
because it didn't happen i assume i mean
that would be something we would
definitely hear about
so no nothing stopped
um
and here's how jen replied by twitter
in his china state-affiliated media he
said the question that u.s leaders
should ask is why other nations
including china don't have such a
serious problem like in the u.s
so something must be seriously wrong
with the u.s itself blaming others won't
help solve your problems just waste of
time
now i told you he was good right
he's actually really good at this
so he's you know redirecting the blame
to you know why is it other countries
don't have this problem there must be
something you're doing wrong in the
united states
so i i responded him by saying
i prefer labeling the people killed by
your fentanyl weapons of mass
destruction victims
and not focus so much on what made them
easy to kill
we get it your wmds target the weak
so i framed it as
yeah you're kind of right we do have a
problem
and it allowed you to pick off the
weakest among us with your weapons of
mass destruction
reframed boom
but we're not done yet
chen comes back for more
he says uh
to me
you become as toxic as pompeo
toxic as pompeo
good historical reference
on point
on point
you become as toxic as pompeo just think
hard
okay
why us is having such horrible drug
problem gun violence largest prison
population and huge army of homeless
people on streets 50 million covet cases
800 000 deaths don't blame china blame
those in washington who brainwash you
daily
strong point
strong point
and i responded to him
you know about
his good point that
we have so many problems over here
maybe there is a better way to do things
good point
so i responded i said
maybe we need a murderous dictatorship
with no freedom like china has
chen says it works great
i think i forgot one of our exchanges
but you get the idea
get the idea now here's the weird thing
i'm literally sitting here in my pajamas
like actually right now i'm
wearing pajama bottoms as i always do
when i'm doing these
and
i'm tweeting with a representative of
the chinese government
and i'm pretty sure they pay attention
to opinions in the united states
especially if they're you know
existential
questions of survival
and i'm pretty sure that they pay
attention to you know anybody that they
think
needs their own private troll
if i've if i've qualified for a troll
you know
somebody's watching you know that
doesn't mean president xi is but
somebody's watching
so i get to stay here in my pajamas and
reframe uh china's dictatorship and do
it in public so everybody gets to watch
and i i can just do this you know i i
can literally
uh
try to influence public relations all
about the toilet
and that's not even a joke like that
literally literally that's happening
all right um here's what
chen doesn't realize
about the united states
he imagines that we don't criticize our
own government
or that we don't criticize our own
people
jen
i literally
was tweeting just before this exchange a
bunch of michael schellenberger you know
stuff about exactly how to fix
everything we messed up
with you know these very problems that
that chen is mentioning which are real
right addiction homelessness you know
crime all that all real problems but he
imagines that somehow i'm not i'm not
criticizing my own government
jen if you watch me for even like a
minute
i criticize everything
this is america we can say anything we
want
well you know until social media cancels
you but you can certainly criticize the
government
like
pretty well get away with that
um
anyway
here's uh something i tweeted today what
we learned in the pandemic now before i
start this i'm gonna tell you that this
is a manipulative
manipulative thread
yeah this i'm using what's called a list
persuasion
meaning that i'm going to say a bunch of
things you agree with
to get you nodding along oh yeah oh yeah
and then i'm going to slip one in at the
end if i really wanted to fool you i
would have put it in the middle
putting it at the end sort of signals to
you that you know to pay attention to
what i'm doing here so i wanted to give
you at least a
fighting chance
to know that it was
know that it was designed to make a
point as opposed to you know doing it
subtly
so it's overt um persuasion let's see
and by the way
even if you know that it's overt it
still works
so it won't be any less powerful
because i told you i'm doing it and i
even told you how i'm doing
we'll let you go away
user goodbye
all right
so here's what we learned in the
pandemic we learned a lot during the
pandemic for example we learned that we
can't tell the difference between the
beginning of a pandemic
and the end
literally
are we at the end of a pandemic
are we at the beginning
i don't know
do you
i don't even have a gas
um we learned that our government will
lie to us if they think they have a good
reason
also they always think they have a good
reason
so
chan in case you wondered if i ever
criticized my government read my threads
we learned the difference between the
news
and an organized brainwashing operation
the summary is that there's no
difference we learned the experts are
super helpful
because you can plan find plenty of them
to support any position
uh as well as its opposite
we learned that the difference between
data and guessing
is mostly in the spelling
we learned that we need to bypass the
gatekeepers of information and do our
own research
also we learned that doing our own
research was basically a way to marinate
in our own confirmation bias until it
congealed into hatred
we learned that the fake news business
can
disappear
enormous stories
and we learned it's coordinated
we learned that listening to a highly
credentialed expert talking with an
independent podcaster seems like a great
way to learn what is true about the
world but in fact it is often the
opposite
uh just kidding we didn't actually learn
that
okay that's the one i was slipping in
there
because there's still some holdouts here
who believe that if they hear one expert
talking to one independent podcaster
that they're more informed
maybe
but you can't tell the difference that's
the problem
sometimes it might be exactly what you
need
and actually inform you and be all
useful and stuff but you can't tell the
difference it could be exactly the
opposite of that and we've seen lots of
examples of that i don't have to give
you examples
of where something was wrong that
appeared on a podcast and an expert said
it
so
just uh i would caution you to have some
humility
about how much you can discern by
listening to one expert even a really
good expert
and one independent podcaster even a
really good one
and by the way
i think any independent podcaster would
tell you the same thing
do you do you think that tim poole or
do you think that joe rogan would
disagree with what i just said
i mean i don't know haven't asked them
but i doubt it
i doubt it
i imagine that they would say you know
see it in context with everything else
but
you know the model is good for getting
one side of the equation out there but
if you don't see it all together and
somebody there to ask questions at the
same time and fact check it in real time
it's probably going to be more
more misleading than not
depending on the topic
scott if you can't trust data experts or
studies
how do we measure anything
um
well you have to you have to keep
measuring because if you're not
measuring you're not managing if you're
not managing we're just flailing around
so you have to measure
but you have to learn
how to assess
the quality of your measuring
and here's the first thing i tell you
don't ask an expert who's not an expert
on data analysis if the data analysis
tells you something
ask somebody who's an expert on data
analysis so if an expert on data
analysis says
i don't see any problems with this
doesn't mean it's true
but if you get enough of those
your certainty should start to harden
but if you have a doctor who says i
trust this data
and it's only a doctor who says it's
good data who might not be an expert on
data analysis
then i would say that's just
sort of an open question
you better look for some more
confirmation
so you want to look for things that
predict
things that predict are more likely to
be closer to the truth
look for
making sure that you've heard both sides
of everything if you see one expert on a
podcast
do this i do this a lot
go go put in the name of that expert and
then debunk
the word debunk
you'll always get hits
even if the expert didn't say anything
wrong you're always going to get a hit
on that
so if it's a high enough profile so do
that
make sure you see at least both sides
and assume that any data is misleading
especially if you know the source it
could be a bias source
so you have to have your skepticism a
maximum that would be my
advice make sure you hear both sides
even if you have to go look for the
other side
all right
here's some
persuasion technique from a gentleman i
think named still unvaccinated phd so
it's a twitter account
and he responded to my thread by saying
we learned that some people can be duped
into taking experimental vaccines and
wear diapers on their face if you scare
them with a bad cold
how's that persuasion
good persuasion or bad i'll read it
again just read just listen to it to see
if it's persuasive we learned that some
people can be duped into taking
experimental vaccines and wear diapers
on their face if you scare them with a
bad cold
is it persuasive
well mocking is generally persuasive
all right so
here's half of my answer but wait for
the other half
mocking is really persuasive
trust me as the
creator of the dilbert comic strip
um well actually you just saw a story
about that recently you saw that elon
musk
says that he uses the dilbert rule if i
can call it that uh to decide what makes
sense and what doesn't within his
companies
so he says if if you're doing something
that looks like it could appear in the
dilbert comic
you know maybe rethink that
so yes
mocking
is so powerful that it could become the
operating system for one of the biggest
companies in the world
like that actually happened
literally
you know while we're talking that's
happening so yes mocking is really
powerful but
there's one catch you sort of have to
deliver the goods
right
mocking is good in any context to scare
people away from an opinion
but
it's better if you have a little bit to
back it up so if he had let's say had
made the same tweet and then followed it
with some links to some
you know studies or some articles that
backed it up that'd be
pretty good
but as it is it looks like a tell for
cognitive dissonance do you know why
because it's only word thinking that's
what my name for it word thinking
all he did was replace the names of
things
that we normally call them the other
normal names with insulting names
that's all he did he just changed you
know the vaccines into experiment
obviously you could argue that point
diapers on the face you know instead of
masks and the bad cold instead of
you know the
coronavirus
so
here's my response i said if you think
of if you think one side of the vax
novak's debate is operating in a fear
and it's only one side
that's got all the fear
they're afraid of that
coronavirus
you don't really understand humans
it's all fear
both sides are afraid just afraid of
different things one's afraid of
the vaccination and the government
and whatever it leads to control
uh you know damage down the line from
the vaccination and the other side might
be afraid of the the coronavirus itself
more than they're afraid of the
vaccination but both sides make the
decision based on fear
because we don't have data
if we had data they could really tell
you specifically
yeah which one is better for you or even
your class of people i mean unless
you're in an obvious class like 80 years
old or something it's not obvious what
you should do
i'm a perfect example that i would look
everywhere to find information that
would tell me in my personal situation
what i should do
but it doesn't exist
we're just guessing and do you know what
happens when you're guessing
you generally are biased toward
relieving your own fear so if you had a
a fear
here's how a brain works i'm not talking
about anybody in particular right this
is just understanding how a brain a
normal brain works
if there were a person not you
but if there were a person who was
afraid of needles
they would very easily talk themselves
into
thinking that it's an experimental
vaccine that doesn't work
and they wouldn't be aware of it but you
have to that's where you have to
understand that the person who is making
that argument
wouldn't know that the real reason was a
fear a fear of a needle
now i'm not saying that applies to any
specific person or you know how many
people that would apply to i'm just
saying that's a normal way a brain works
if you think that's the exception
and that that's like a special case
then
the whole all of life will be confusing
to you
because we don't work that way and
science
and hypnosis agree
science hypnosis agree
that people are irrational and they
rationalize after they make decisions
and fear is the main reason right fear
and mating basically
you know you want you want to you know
satisfy your basic needs but that's
basically what you're afraid of and what
you want to have sex with
and that's it and then you rationalize
it after the fact so imagining that
there is one rational side of this
debate and one irrational side is a
tip-off that you're operating at a low
level of awareness
but
doesn't mean you're wrong you could be
right
but if you're starting with the point of
view that you're right and the other
side or that you're rational and the
other side is irrational
you just got lucky
you could be right
but it would be because somebody was
going to be right
it was two irrational sides and somebody
was going to be right
so in the end whoever it is by luck
mostly
is going to say well you idiots it was
obvious all the time
so obvious
so obvious
you idiots
i saw it from the beginning
that's what the people who are right by
accident will say after this now if
there had been good data
that we all were looking at or could
have looked at
and we didn't see it like it was right
there in front of us and we just
couldn't see all that good data
well then maybe it would be a case of
people being stupid
but nothing like that's happening
nothing like that's happening we have no
idea
like you know a month ago
we would have said well all the
vaccinations are about the same
risk this month
that j j and all so much
that's a pretty big difference
how many months ago would we have said
yeah these vaccinations are really gonna
clamp down on this this pandemic and
then the omicron comes along
right
so
we don't know anything
you know i started out by saying that we
don't know if we're at the beginning of
a pandemic or the end
we literally don't know
i don't know do you
are we at the beginning of the end what
do you think
in the comments you tell me
are we at the beginning meaning it's
just going to be omicron all day long
or at the end
are you are you not seeing what i'm
seeing which is completely opposite
reporting about the omicron danger
i'm seeing reporting that it's no big
deal
relative to the other ones at the same
time i'm saying that it's going to rip
through the health care system and crash
it
though both stories are
are blazing with equal intensity are
they not
i think they are
so
yeah
i feel like
uh
omicron is going to be
it's going to be a punch in the face and
a kick in the balls
i think omicron is going to hit us a
little bit harder than we might have
expected we the public not the experts
but
there we go james
there we go
we're so done with this aren't we
here's one of the things that i love
about humans
i love about humans
we're flexible
until we're not
i love that about us
that we have the ability to be just
amazingly flexible
like adaptive flexible
until we're not
and then once we're not
you better get out of the way
because
because the public hasn't quite made up
its mind yet
it hasn't
you know i keep telling you that if
you're worried that the the government
in america i'm only talking about the
united states if you're worried about
the government is
keeping you down and putting all these
restrictions on you and stuff it's not
the government
it's your fellow citizens
because as soon as your fellow citizens
were
on the same side as you were
the government would be helpless because
they need to get elected and all that
stuff
but the problem is that the citizens are
divided now why
why are the citizens divided it's
because the fake news industry does that
as their business model
has nothing to do with the government
the the fake news has divided the people
and so the government at the moment has
all the power because we're divided
but we also can see it
and we're also
we're also discovering a common enemy
right the people on the left
were far more likely to take government
advice further
but they have a limit
right
the the left will trust the government
way farther than the right
but not to infinity
not to infinity
and i think
yeah i think things are becoming a
little more more clear
so
um we also are going to reevaluate the
value of life i think
if it's not already happened
i think we're just going to say
yeah we want to protect everybody
but we don't have that option so
let's stop talking about it and just go
to work
and we'll do our best
now
have i ever told you that you that the
the end of a problem in the beginning of
a problem can look the same
like it looks like it's your worst day
but it might be just before the best day
you know the
it's always darkest before the dawn sort
of thing
there are two
realities forming here
and i
i think we have to push one of them into
existence
i think we have to
um
focus our collective intentions on this
simulation
and just power ourselves out here are
the two realities sort of like a
schrodinger's cat
on one is the omicron is going to be
worse than anything we've ever seen
so far
and we're going to be locked down to god
knows what with another
variant right behind it maybe
that possibility is forming with with
such likelihood
that it's like one of the possibilities
of the cat in the schrodinger's cat
mental experiment
but the other one is exactly the
opposite
that we've got the
coveted pills
we're pretty good with the treatment now
all of the weakest humans have already
been i hate to say it but they've
already died
and you know there's both natural
immunity and
and
let's say
shutdown fatigue
that
we may be very close to the end of it
you know if the if the omicron
rages for a month
and our death count doesn't go up
too much
we're done
am i right
because i think we were willing to sit
down through alpha
and then i think that we were convinced
that delta was worse
and we said oh crap we're gonna well
let's sit it out it's just a few more
months we can do this
but omicron is going to change how we
think about it i think
i think it's going to change how we
think about it
meaning that
we're just going to be done
and even if it does pack the hospitals
i think the public's going to say
that's the trade-off
to get back to back to life now all of
this depends
on how much we learn in the next few
weeks about the
whether we can keep the the death count
low
at the same time the virus is raging
through now let me tell you my anecdotal
experience
you know a guy who went to a wedding
recently everybody was vaccinated
100 vaccinated wedding
eight people came came home with uh
covert
eight people
out of a wedding
and that's the ones we know about right
they were all vaccinated allegedly
right
of the people i know
about the same number of vaccinated
unvaccinated and then we're seeing some
reports that i don't think are verified
yet
that uh the vaccination
has a modest effect at most on omicron
this could be the best possible
situation
or the worst
do you see how you can't tell
because if you if if it turned out that
omicron was a mild
mild for everybody except you know the
sickest person in the world if it's mild
for everybody what would be the perfect
situation
would the perfect situation be that the
existing vaccines stop it
or would the perfect situation be
that the unvaccinated would use the
vaccinated
as their vaccination
in other words the way you would get the
omicron in the first place is from a
vaccinated person thank you very much
i appreciate the vaccination
that's possible
now i don't know what the odds of that
are is there anybody smart enough to say
omicron's going to wipe out our health
care
versus anybody smart enough to say oh
the perfect situation just arose and
we're just blind to it
we want omicron to rip through the
vaccinated population as fast as
possible get them all
right under that i'm not saying that
that's what i want because we don't have
enough information to say that
but i'm saying that one of the futures
that is not ruled out by anything i've
seen maybe you have
it's a future that's not ruled out and
well within contention for a possible
future
let me tell you how i understand the
world
you ready for the weirdest thing you've
heard in a while
my experience is
that if i get
an envelope
i was going to use a visual aid but
it's too far away
if i get an envelope in the mail and i
know that the contents of that envelope
are going to be either good news or bad
because it's that kind of a
a letter you know it's either going to
be the yes or the no that you're waiting
for either you got accepted or you
didn't get accepted or you won money or
you didn't win money something like that
my world view is and i'm not kidding
this is
legitimate
that the contents of the envelope
are variable
until i see it
just like schrodinger's cat
now is it true
none of it's true
this whole reality is just a subjective
uh hallucination that each of us have
ginned up
so what matters is
does it give me comfort and does it give
me something that i could predict or use
is it useful
and here's the way i have used it in my
life
and this may have this may be nothing
but a way to feel good
but that's useful right it goes like
this
what determines the contents of that
letter
or what determines the
path that this omicron is going to take
us
either to
larger destruction or
a release
that the path is determined by
what
what what determines which way it goes
luck
perception
imagination
what we'll determine which will be
physics will just be cause and effect
will be filters
will it be luck
here's what i think it is
i think it's intention
and i think that
if the public
intends
to get out of this
that's the way it'll go
and if we intend
nothing
then we will be the subject of things
that happen instead of the author
do you want to be the subject
or do you want to be the author
i always choose author
because there's nobody authoring this
story
there's nobody to tell you which path
this is going to go
and so i'm going to tell you
that if you author it
with me
will take us out of here
because my intention
is to get out of this
clearly and unambiguously
my intention is to use the omicron
as the way out the variable that we were
waiting for we didn't ask for it
didn't ask for it but here it is
now
is this
um
new age
crap
that would be one way to look at it
is it something that i can guarantee you
works
no we don't live in that kind of reality
where something can be guaranteed at all
will it make you feel better
if you think it might
for some of you yes
if it goes that way and you feel you had
a role in it
will it make you feel powerful
it will
will give you a sense of control
it will
now
while it is true that everybody wanted
to get out of the pandemic
how many intended
it's different
it was a whole bunch of people waiting
around and wanting something
wanting doesn't move anything
there's lots of stuff you want
but you have to decide
before it's an intention
the decision comes first
so you need to decide right here if you
want to be part of this
process
you have to decide
that omicron's the way out
or if it's not omicron there's something
you know also imminent could be the pill
you know something like that
so
i think it's time to decide
time to decide
i intend
for this to be closer to the end by the
end i'm thinking spring is probably
going to be the earliest we can get
anything done
for getting back to normal
early spring march april
that's my guess
because by then we'll know enough about
the omicron to
to know for sure what's what's what
so i say it's a schrodinger's cat
experiment it's an envelope you haven't
opened and you can determine the
contents of that envelope
so
author it
author it
just make it happen
it's going to feel good if we do it
so
is anybody following the galen maxwell
story
it's kind of hard isn't it
didn't they
just lost a bunch of cds with evidence
on it
did i see lost it huh
just lost it
and then she didn't testify so now it's
over
so the gelatine maxwell thing that we
all thought would be the
the opening of the pandora's box or the
the secret safe and we'd find out
all the epstein secrets
is there any doubt whatsoever
that the epstein plus the maxwell
situation is being managed by some
intelligence agency
does anybody have any doubt anymore
i mean seriously is does does anybody
think it's not at this point
it's so
it's so overt
it would be pretty hard to
argue against it at this point i mean i
don't know which one i mean you could
use your own
conspiracy theory but obviously
obviously there's somebody important
who's making things happen somebody who
can make something like this go away
um
imagine how much money
could be applied to making that story go
away
it's almost unlimited
all right
um scott follow the money yeah i mean
it's sort of obvious
what's going on at this point
all right uh did i miss any stories
you know i didn't even i didn't even
look at the news sites today
do you all have your dilbert calendars i
hope you have them
don't want to run out
um trivial compared to the amount of
money behind vaccines yeah
the entire pandemic was to take out
trump
i don't know about that
it was a worldwide pandemic
so what's the difference between look
for the other side and do your own
research well i
i like to put myself in the
shoes or well here's a test i did
actually with the kamala harris video i
talked about earlier
if
if trump had done exactly what kamal
harris did
which was go hard at a at a question
i wouldn't have blinked about it
so i tried to say oh if that had been
trump
i would have just said oh he just went
hard at this
this journalist
or or podcaster
so
you know if you if you do that it sort
of opens up your own bias you could you
could think oh my am i just being biased
here
so it's a good practice
um
just watch the entire blunder it is
clear that is not a blunder or a mistake
well you mean that it looks like she
planned
to do something that would make
an impact and maybe even you know
especially directed at the you know
black
audience maybe i mean i don't i don't
have enough
let's say cultural insight to know if
that's a thing or not
um
at snl yeah it looks like we're on the
border of another close down in
california i think everything's gonna
shut up
uh is gonna shut
what what is the
what was the old saying my father used
to say
uh
tighter than a beaver's ass or something
yes he has some homey saying about it
tighter than something's ass
but um we're heading in the direction of
the california is going to close down
now biden's going to do a
a speech on tuesday right
what do you think and it's about uh
omicron what do you what do you think
the biden speech is gonna be
i think
the obvious answer would be he's gonna
tell us we have to
suck it up even harder am i right
yeah i think it's going to be
batten down and get your shots and get
your fourth booster and all that
i feel like it is
but that may be uh partly modified
because the new news that came out that
the shots are not that effective against
omicron
so he's going to have to figure out how
to dance around that
but i'll tell you what's not going to
happen he's not going to say it looks
terrible but we're not going to shut
down
you know we just have to power through
this now
i don't think that's going to happen
uh
look for a winter of deaths yeah
scott you rely so much on andrei spekkos
who do you rely on for the go-to
counterpoint well he is the counterpart
he is the counterpoint so in other words
um
he's generally reacting to someone's
point
and generally criticizing the analysis
so but to your point
even better than hearing the point in
the counterpoint would be hearing the
point the counterpoint and then the
response to the counterpoint right the
closer you could get it to an actual
you know jury trial model would be good
if you could make it entertaining
i don't know is anybody pro-mandate
anymore
do you like carl young
um
you know
i'm not sure i buy the carl young stuff
but i also haven't studied it enough to
give you a good opinion
all right i believe that's all i have to
say
yeah there's there's did you see that
some company made a uh a chip you can
embed in your arm so they can uh
somebody can uh put their phone up and
see if you're vaccinated
that's not scary at all is it
um
didn't you say lists are bleeding no
no i didn't say that i said that lists
are usually how
people hide the opinion that they're
really trying to persuade you on they'll
put it on a list with some good stuff
so that's list persuasion um but
well there's two kinds of list
persuasion one is you take a whole bunch
of points that individually are terrible
but if you have enough of them it looks
like it forms a pattern
yeah it doesn't necessarily
and the other kind is when you have a
list that's a bunch of stuff the other
side is going to agree with then you
slip in one
that maybe they wouldn't after they've
said yes yes yes yes
maybe
what time did i wake up this morning 2
am
got a solid 4 hours today
uh
all right
carl about just reading your comments
they're keeping the pandemic going for
2022.
do you think that's what's going on do
you think the democrats want to keep the
pandemic going for 2022
how could they possibly win if the
pandemic is still going i mean
if you're thinking it's about
mail-in ballots
maybe
maybe
there might be some people are thinking
that way
i'll give you that
i'm not sure that's what's driving all
the decisions but certainly there would
be some people thinking that
do i nap once in a while
all right all right that's all i got for
now
i think you'll agree this was
the best thing you've ever seen in your
life
ah
and you can't wait for tomorrow
am i right
and we're gonna have a great christmas
and remember
focus your intentions
let's get out of this thing
and
all right funny comment sir um
what time do i finally wake up
all right bye for now youtube
