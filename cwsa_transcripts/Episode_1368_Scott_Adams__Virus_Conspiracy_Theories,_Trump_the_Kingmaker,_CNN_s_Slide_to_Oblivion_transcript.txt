oh wouldn't it be good if i had more
than one piece of paper in my hand
because if i did that would indicate
that my printer was working and that my
notes for today would be in my hand
but no i have two fairly new printers in
my home
at least one of them is going to be
sacrificed today i don't know which one
so they're both new they should both
work but i'm going to take one of them
and throw them off
throw it off the balcony but you have to
make the other one watch
so one of them will be executed today
because they've been
way out of line i mean they just don't
like to print anything anymore
and so i'm going to destroy one of them
for my pleasure while making the other
one watch
but before i do that wouldn't you like
to enjoy
this episode of coffee with scott adams
like you never have before well that's
not going to happen but you could have a
cup or a margarita glass a tanker gels
just either canteen jogger flies a
vessel of any kind
you can fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip but it happens now
go
now i've been told that sometimes you
can't see the simultaneous
because you're uh you're getting here
too late and there's a commercial
running on youtube
when it live streams you could
you could subscribe to youtube and then
you don't see the commercials
or you could if you don't want to watch
it live uh it's
it also turns into a podcast after we
download it and convert it to a podcast
so you can listen to it without the
commercials
any on any of the podcasts available
everywhere
all right let's talk about the news
which i'm going to be looking in the
wrong direction
and my glowing screen because if i
haven't mentioned this yet
printers printers don't work now
now if you have a printer at home one of
those things that
tries to put ink on paper just unplug it
carry it to the window and just throw it
out the window
because printers don't work they are
just a source of annoyance
so i'm going to be reading off of this
other screen here annoyingly
not looking at you so there's something
that
uh the fake news does
that you know the fact that they can get
away with this is amazing but here are
the two ways that they prove things
so they can prove something doesn't
exist
through the process of not looking for
it
that's it that's their investigative
process for the fake news
is don't look for it and then you can
prove it doesn't exist
well i didn't look for it and i didn't
find it therefore it doesn't exist but
the other thing is
they can prove something does exist by
finding some anonymous sources
who have no credibility and are known to
hate the person that they're
they're talking about that's how you
prove something does exist
talking to people who hate the person
you you want to report on
but here's the example this chris eliza
today and cnn has an opinion piece
and he says this following quote
facts say the election was one fair and
square by biden
facts say that do facts say that
all right this is cnn they're they're a
news organization
and apparently this got past the editors
so they they must agree that this is
true enough the facts
say the election was for one fair and
square
which facts are those
this is an example of proving a negative
you can't prove something didn't happen
because you didn't look for it
why why would there be an arizona audit
what would be the point of an arizona
audit if everybody's already looked at
everything
wouldn't the audit just be oh just show
us your documents
and we'll just look at the documents
because we already know everything
you wouldn't have to do an audit if you
knew everything you
needed to know so it would be true
and i and i would agree this is true
this might be the last time you see me
on social media
it's true that there's no proof of any
widespread
fraud there's no proof
at least what i would consider proof
certainly not
court blessed proof oh they're
you know there are statistical arguments
and there are questions and things like
that
and plenty of things we haven't looked
into but there are no
facts that prove it's that the election
was
fair and square that just doesn't exist
and the fact that somebody can say that
in public
is just mind-boggling because you can
completely get away with that
um this is one of those times where i
wonder
does chris eliza believe what he's
writing
and i think the answer is yes which is
scarier than
you you kind of hope he's lying because
if he's not
if he's not doing it intentionally and i
don't think he is
you know i don't have any evidence to
say that he's doing it intentionally
lying i mean he actually believes
if this is true you know if you take
about his word he believes that not
looking for it
proves it doesn't exist isn't that weird
they're like we really live in that
world that that's just
that's just the fact that's out there
and we're like oh okay didn't look for
it everywhere so must not exist
um
so yesterday had an interesting
interesting situation so i'm doing some
home renovations and if you do home
renovations there's this
continuous stream of people that you
didn't know before coming in and out of
your house
usually doing work or delivering
something or whatever
and it has become so easy
to identify trump supporters versus
democrats
by the basque you know the the the
people who show up
so yesterday there was a uh let's just
say a
couple of people showed up and
immediately i looked at them and
saw them you know maskless in the
driveway
now it's the driveway they're not inside
and they're not standing near anybody
they're outdoors
the only ones who would take their masks
off
outdoors and we're the vaccinated uh
trump supporters basically
so it was pretty easy to tell who's who
now now i don't think that was always
the case
we're gonna be we're gonna be passing
through this weird period of time
where you can just identify somebody's
political leanings
just like that has that ever been the
case before
i mean i suppose if somebody had blue
hair you could say they're probably a
democrat
but maybe it's a little more obvious now
here's my here's my persuasion
suggestion for
republicans who are trying to argue that
changes to
the voting rules in their states
uh democrats are saying any change to
the voting rules such as georgia or
florida or texas or wherever it happens
that any change is designed to restrict
voting
and specifically restrict it against
minority voters i guess
and suppose you're the gop and you want
to
persuade against that and you want to
make it seem as though the only reason
you're doing these things
is to make the voting system more secure
first of all what is true
is it true that these changes are to
make the voting system more secure
to make sure only the right people vote
or is the secret
real reason to suppress the vote of
minorities and keep
republicans in power why can't it be
both
why can't it be both it's not even
unethical
it could be both and i think republicans
should just say it
oh totally this will definitely keep us
in power that's one of the reasons we're
doing it
it's also true that we should do it
no matter what because protecting the
integrity of the election
is really important and other countries
and states are doing what we want to do
we're just conforming to best practices
but if you're asking us
do we also have a motive that we think
will win more elections totally
yeah yeah that's one of the reasons
we're doing it but that doesn't change
anything from the fact that it should be
done
just fricking tell us can you imagine
how that would sound
like you would you would get chills on
your arm if you heard a politician tell
you the truth
because it's just so unusual you would
say what are you saying
you wouldn't even know what was coming
out of their mouth there is no
shame in saying yeah we totally are
motivated to win elections
and you should be motivated to have a
good election
that you can trust we're on the same
page
it just isn't good for democrats and we
fully admit that
i think you'd just say it people would
appreciate it i always tell this story
about willie brown
the politician uh democrat politician
for
in california for many decades and there
was this one situation where
he was asked to vote on something about
smoking in public or public places
and somebody pointed out how could he be
a legitimate politician on the question
of smoking when he had accepted money
from tobacco companies and willie brown
to his enduring glory i think i'll
always love him for this
he said he looked he looked at whoever
asked the question and he said i'm
paraphrasing
but he said if you can't take money from
somebody
and then turn around and screw them
you're in the wrong business
am i right when somebody says something
that honest
sounding you just go okay
like it just completely throws you off
your game and you don't even for a
moment you don't know who you are or
what you're doing it's like uh
you weren't supposed to answer that
honestly now
i don't know which way he voted but
that's like the most transparent answer
i've ever seen yeah i could take their
money
and i can screw them if you couldn't do
that you don't belong in this job
that's a great answer but here's what i
think the
gop should do instead of arguing
that you know it's good for their
elections and it's good for the country
too or
good for the state they should do the
opposite
and fund well actually
let me change the topic a little bit um
well no let's do this sorry i don't want
to think out loud while i'm doing this
but sometimes it happens
that's because i don't have a printer
that works if it were written down on my
little piece of paper
it wouldn't have any problems at all so
imagine um
if the gop funded some uh commercials
or some ads some viral ads ideally viral
that uh that opposed any
restrictions on illegal voters
let me say that again suppose the
republicans
funded commercials that are not branded
republican
so you can't tell who made the
commercial and it just
it promotes trying to protect the votes
of illegal citizens i'll say
undocumented but people are not citizens
what would you do if you saw a whole
bunch of commercials
supporting the the right of undocumented
people or even illegal votes just say
americans who are
americans who are not legal to vote in
that state
what would you what would happen if you
saw a bunch of push
for illegal votes to be counted
it was sort of changed the argument
wouldn't it because
the republicans could make it
turn it into an argument about whether
illegal people should be
people who are not legal to vote should
be able to vote
and i think that would just mess with
people's minds but anyway that's just
speculative that's never going to happen
there's a great piece of writing
that i tweeted you'll see it at the top
of my twitter feed
this morning and it talks about the
question of whether the virus was
engineered in a
in a lab would be at the wun lab
or other but mostly the wuhan lab and
here was the uh the outcome so basically
the the article very smart article
uh talked about how completely doable it
would be
to engineer a virus that nobody could
tell was engineered
now what you're mostly not experts here
most of you are not experts on virology
let me ask you just common sense
do you believe without knowing anything
about
viruses do you believe
that somebody who does know about
viruses
could make a new virus that's more
powerful
in some way and that other people
couldn't tell
that it was engineered what do you think
do you think that you could always tell
if something is an engineered virus
yeah right your common sense
tells you it's possible right
just common sense now i have to tell you
that early on in the pandemic
i privately because i didn't want this
to be you know public speculation
i privately asked the smartest people i
know
doesn't it seem obvious that you could
make a virus
that's engineered that doesn't look like
it's anything but natural
every smart person i asked that question
to
said the same thing oh yeah you could do
that
all of them but yet the news was
consistently reporting
that these experts could tell if there
was an engineered virus
now again i don't know anything about
anything
but if you said to me scott how could
you engineer a virus that looked natural
i would say well i would just make it
natural
all you'd have to do is you know get
some viruses together to mutate or
evolve
then test the different the different
ones that evolve
until you've tested and found the one
that's the most badass version
of all the naturally occurring things
that you sped up the evolution of
they would simply be speed evolved but
nobody in the world would be able to
tell
now apparently there's also another
technical way to do it that
doesn't involve just natural mutations
but common sense
tells you that was doable right i mean
did you really need to be a virus expert
to know that you could mutate some genes
and then pick the good ones
you know maybe you needed to mutate it
through some different species
which is part of the process right you
know bats to pangolins or bats to
anything else
but it's all doable it's it's understood
known
science and then apparently we do know
that some people who are saying it
wasn't doable had some connection to the
wuhan lab
what that's right some of the experts
saying that
it wouldn't be possible to do this
without being detected
had a little connection to the lab did
you know that
well read about it in that article who's
the author whose name i didn't write
down but i should have
all right um jen saki
apparently you know the spokesperson for
biden
apparently said on the uh the david
axelrod's
show that this is a quote um
talking about biden taking impromptu
questions for reporters
saki said it is not something we
recommend
so so the uh even the spokesperson says
they don't recommend biden
just take random questions from
reporters
now on one hand that's just being smart
if you could have controlled trump
which obviously was impossible but if
his staff
could have controlled him would they
have told him to not take questions
random questions probably
probably right because answering random
questions from reporters
rarely is going to help you but you know
i would think four out of five times
it's going to hurt you
so just mathematically speaking you know
playing the odds
you probably shouldn't take random
questions from reporters
but we all appreciated that trump did
right it made news it was
it was fun it was provocative and it was
really transparent
and we learned probably more than we
would have if had been some
you know more organized scenario so
thank you james uh i
i actually would not criticize jen saki
for saying out loud what i think is just
common sense
you don't want the boss answering random
questions this
is not a good idea you want you want
preparation you want
to control your situation as much as
possible so i think you would have said
that about anybody
but when it's said about biden it just
sounds a little extra bad
all right um
let's talk about that vares database you
probably a lot of you saw tucker carlson
talking about
a database called devayers
and apparently anybody literally anybody
can enter a report that says
i got a vaccination and then some bad
adverse effect happened or somebody died
now
the trouble is that these are unverified
reports
so some of them might not be true that's
a problem
and others might be just core um
correlation without causation now you
saw tucker report that if
if it's true that 30 people a day are
dying from the vaccination
which by the way i don't have any
evidence that that's true
the if that were true that would be a
big problem and we should know about it
and
somebody should be doing something about
it
but this database does not have that
kind of credibility
what it does do is say that reportedly
and again you don't know that the
reports are true
but then somebody got a vaccination and
then somebody died
let me put this in context using the
argument on a tweet from aaron blake who
writes for the fix
and other things i think um
so he says tucker cited unverified data
that 30 people who got vaccinated
die daily the unverified part meaning
it's in that vares database
and then aaron points out that 8 000
americans die every day
i had to i googled it to make sure
that's in the
that's in the ballpark so that's in the
ballpark
uh high seven thousands close to eight
thousand people
americans die every day more than forty
percent of the population has received
one dose of vaccine
so if you took forty percent of 8000
you'd expect more than 3 000 people
a day would die in america
soon after getting a vaccine now
these are you know back of the envelope
numbers so
you know you could refine these quite a
bit but in general
in a general sense if the math works the
way math works
you should see something like 3
000 people a day dying
not long after you know within some
period not long after
they got a vaccination
but the but the number is 30. we should
see 3 000.
in other words if there's no problem at
all with vaccines
if the vaccine problem were zero
and it's probably not zero right but if
it were zero
you would still see 3 000 people a day
dying soon after they got a vaccination
now if you didn't know that what would
you think
when you heard 30 people a day are
reportedly
again not verified reportedly
dying of soon after getting a
vaccination
yeah it's completely misleading and i
think you have to keep that in context
all right uh have you noticed that there
are a lot of
people hiring and yet the unemployment
rate actually got a little worse
so we have tons of open jobs
and we got more people looking for work
than ever
how can that be true lots of open jobs
but more people unemployed and the
answer is that they don't have the right
skills
or they're not in the right area for the
jobs
now i've been telling you that we're in
a golden age
try to think of any problem you would
rather have than this one
i mean i hate to be an optimist about
everything yeah i tend to be
but seriously if you could if you could
pick a problem
because you don't really get to have no
problems that's not one of your options
if you could pick the problem you had to
have among all the problems there could
be i'm going to take that one every time
i want the problem that we have more
jobs
than we have people trained to do them
because
you know how to fix that right you train
more people to do those jobs
so we know how to fix that that is your
best situation
i always say about that about health
your best situation is not that you're
perfectly healthy
because nobody gets that it's not an
option
you can't be perfectly healthy nobody
gets that
the best thing is you can have a health
problem that has a pill
i for example i have acid reflux fairly
common
but i'm lucky there's a pill
i just i just take a little pill
basically
no no harmful side effects so if you've
got a
economic problem that's as easy
relatively easy and straightforward to
fix as this one
you're in a really good place and we
might be
let's talk about the ratings of the news
according to
rasmussen now this would be a poll of
likely voters
so this is not a poll of ratings the way
ratings companies do their own ratings
but this is likely voters here's the
change
recently i forget which time period but
this is a
recent change to the ratings uh i guess
cnn lost 22 percent
of likely voters from their viewership
i don't know if this might be the in the
last year or something i forget the time
period
but uh 22 percent
now my first thought was you know you
don't want to take a run at the king
unless you can finish him off and trump
although he's out of office at the
moment he's definitely not finished off
if you know what i mean so that was my
first thought it's like oh they
went after trump but they didn't finish
him off so now they're paying for it
but then i saw that msnbc is up five
so cnn is down 22
but another left-leaning entity msnbc is
up five percent
and then fox news the the juggernaut
which is fox news
they're up nine percent
i'll tell you say what you will
about fox news and i've said this a
number of times and i'll
i'm gonna double down on it fox news is
the best produced
show for the news i mean they just they
just
clean the table with msnbc and cnn just
on production
and production i'm going to include
talent selection
and the way they organize shows if you
look at the
the engineering behind the five you know
that that show on
the fox if you look at guffeld's new
show
if you look at hannity if you look at
tucker they're just really well produced
shows and so uh politics aside
i think it's just a higher higher
quality product i think people are just
drawn to a higher quality product
so i say this all the time but as often
as i
uh especially recently as often as i
will criticize fox news if they get a
story
wrong or there's some bias there's
always plenty of that
but boy there the people that you don't
see on screen
the producers the people who do
everything from the the color to the
you know just the look of it everything
it's just really well done
um so i see in the comments somebody's
mentioning
fox babes now we do not be we're not
sexist here
but it is nonetheless true it is just
the fact that fox hires
probably a little bit on sex appeal if
we're being honest
it's a little bit about sex appeal at
least for the the female
talent is that wrong no
no because i think the news is an
entertainment product
and in the context of entertainment
because it really is i mean we watch the
news for entertainment especially the
opinion
shows i think that's perfectly fair
and the fact that they don't ignore
human motivation how often have i told
you this right
that the difference between the left and
the right is that the right
understands human beings like how we're
motivated
what what makes you turn the channel
what makes you watch and then they just
build a product around human motivation
yeah roger ailes was the
the mind behind that so no i don't have
covet it's just
allergies um
all right and then i got this question a
lot of you were asking it
from a persuasion viewpoint when we see
our top officials who
are vaccinated wearing masks and let's
say joe biden
classic example if you see somebody
who's fully vaccinated
and still wears a mask outdoors in
public
um what do you think of that does that
tell you the vaccination is less
effective
what is the persuasion on this
i say this doesn't hurt persuasion
i get the argument but here's the
counter argument
the counter argument is that everybody
understands the leaders are modeling
they're modeling the epitome of
what they would like to show you is the
safest thing you could be
but i feel like we understand that right
when you see biden wearing a mask in
every situation
even though he's vaccinated do you say
to yourself oh that's how i will act
you don't really do that do you or do
you say oh i get it he's he's just
modeling the extreme
because the extreme of safety is sort of
a good thing for a government to model
let me give you an example this will be
the weirdest
this will be the weirdest ideology ever
and therefore invalid but uh
i've stated before that the federal
government
the president in particular let's just
say the president
i've said before that the president of
the united states is the only person
who should not be in favor of abortion
regardless of why he personally thinks
of abortion
here's why you never want the leader
to be in favor of anything that even
comes close to a gray area
of maybe killing people that are
citizens
that's the one person you don't want the
president
ever to be in favor of anything
in any scenario that's about killing a
person who's an american citizen
or even maybe you know just as a
resident here
everybody else fair game state
individuals okay they
they can talk about the pros and the
cons and they can treat the nuance
but i feel like the president should
just say nope
if it's a question of killing americans
i'm out because
no way doesn't matter what the argument
is even capital punishment
i think the president should stay out of
capital punishment
let the states do it you just never want
a leader
who ever can say i have a good reason to
kill an american
never that should be an absolute for the
president
governors you gotta governor's got to
get some business done
right if it's not the president's job
to make decisions on abortions for
example just stay out of it
that's my opinion all right but same
with uh
so here's the analogy to uh masks
um just as i say the president's the one
person who should stay out of
life and death questions about americans
the president's the one person who
should be able to wear a mask even if
you don't need to
right the president is just sending a
message
it's not so much about the president's
opinion it's not about the president's
sense of the science it's just sending a
message
so i get the logical argument where you
say
hey he's making it seem like the
vaccines are not effective
you know it's a bad message i get that i
mean it's a reasonable
that's a reasonable critique but i just
don't know anybody's actually persuaded
by it
are you do you know anybody who was
persuaded by it
i'm feeling uh i saw a comment yesterday
that uh hit hit a little bit too too
close to home
i was making a comment that democrats
are wearing masks even when they don't
need to
and republicans are not and
somebody who shall remain nameless said
that there may
it might be true that there's a large
segment of the population who is ugly
and the ugly people don't mind wearing
masks
when i first heard that i laughed
because it's like ha ha
you know nobody's gonna want to wear a
mask just because they're
not confident with their looks and then
i realized
that i like wearing a mask because i'm
not confident of my looks
it's true for me i i could say
absolutely
absolutely that i feel more comfortable
wearing a mask in public just in the
terms of
people judging me you know how old are
you or how do you look or do you have
some wrinkles or
anything i think i i absolutely feel
that
so as a representative of ugly people
all over
i i feel these are my people you know
i'm not a big joiner
like i i don't consider myself a
republican or a democrat
or even a white person you know i just
don't i'm not a joiner
i don't like to be in a team but i'm
definitely in team ugly
you know the the people who are short
and bold and wear glasses and
you know and and every other kind of
thing that's you know off standard
these are my people i understand ugly
people better than
better than you beautiful people ever
could so
i get that and i think there's something
to it i do believe
that some people are just want the mass
thing to last a little bit longer
i think that's real all right
that is about all i wanted to talk about
because
somebody says i am not an animal well
sandra you're probably also attractive
if you look at the people who are
fighting the hardest to get rid of masks
it's not a perfect correlation but ask
yourself if they're attractive
i'm sure you're going to see that i'll
bet you're going to see the the
correlation
i'll bet you attractive people want to
leave
lose the masks first right
i'll bet that's true
that's what elephant man said
i i can't i can't bring this up without
elephant man coming into the
conversation
somebody says i want to wear a lipstick
again how many of you have thought i'd
better brush my teeth before i leave the
house and then you said
oh i don't need to how many of you done
that
how many of you have uh eaten eaten
something that like you know is all in
your teeth
like a like a cookie or something that's
just all in your teeth
you go to walk out the door and normally
you'd be like i don't know
brushing your teeth or something and you
say to yourself
i'm not going to be within six feet of
anybody and i've got a mask
i'm good to go how about great britain
great britain with let's say less less
dental
care than the united states maybe they
like their masks a little bit longer
than we do we'll see
somebody says i've skipped shaving i've
i've heard that
people are wearing i think this is a
real fact and i don't think i
imagined this was it ulta or one of the
makeup companies
said that there's way more sales of eye
makeup
so you know they're they're selling less
makeup that's like below the nose and
more makeup that's
above the nose just like you'd expect
yeah you want to go to do you want an
investment uh
advice all right let me stop here i
don't give investment advice
so what i say next will be more because
it's fun
all right so this is for entertainment
if any of you
bet on this and lose your money it's
your own damn fault
don't blame me here's my investment
advice that's not really advice
so don't do this what's going to happen
to a company like ulta
it's a big makeup company well
what will happen to them when the masks
go away
isn't it going to double their income
i mean not double but shouldn't they
have a substantial
like a really good quarter the first
time the masks are really really gone
now maybe it'll be too gradual there'll
never be a day when they're gone
but i don't know how that's possibly
not going to sell more lipstick and more
or whatever the hell you do below the
nose
seems to me somebody says
i need some sun that could go a long way
well you know what this is there's a
lighting problem
which is when you use the uh
any of the apple products they're so
good on light that they just brighten
everything i'm actually sitting in the
dark
weird isn't it but it's almost uh
the lighting in my room it would be late
twilight
right now but if you look here it looks
like i've got a
daytime window right in front of me
yeah even i've got a light rings turned
way down and facing the other direction
so it's it's like dark in here
all right that's all for that's all i
got for now and i will talk to you
tomorrow
