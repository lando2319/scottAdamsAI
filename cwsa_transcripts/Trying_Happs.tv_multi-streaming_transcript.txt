um live but nobody's here because i
haven't invited anybody
i suppose i should have taken the
i'm just testing this so don't worry
if you don't see anything entertaining
that's my plan my plan is that nothing
entertaining is going to happen right
here
i'm just going to test the apps dot tv
interface
so i'm streaming through twitch and
youtube simultaneously through a
through a facility called apps
an app
all right what would it take
to tweet this
you know what would be great as if that
this had a way to just tweet it out
hello
oh hello
so okay
real people huh
all right so uh i'm just checking out
this interface
on haps tv and looking at your comments
which i just found out how to see them
hey everybody quite a few of them
so you're entertained i'm sorry there
won't be there won't be any
entertainment on this i'm
literally just checking the technology
come to a book signing in arizona well
thanks for asking but i probably won't
do any more
uh physical book signings
i just got a twitch notification what's
that tell me
somebody followed me uh
what's your twitch um look for a
username
scott adams put together one word
i think that's how you find me
all right so uh what happened to my uh
kitchen
yeah my kitchen had a leak but that's
that's taken care of
looks like what looks like you're on a
spaceship in the expanse
oh it really does doesn't it
it's pretty funny it does
i could i could probably drink this out
so it does look like i'm on a spaceship
um
we have the same water heater do we
any unnecessary disrespect
yeah no coffee uh do i stream video
games i don't
know i think this is the first time i've
tried streaming on twitch and it's only
because i'm going through
an interface here now in theory i could
i wonder if i could invite any of you
let's see if that's a thing
what is this magic
all right let's see if that's a a thing
present on screen so does that mean i
can pick some of you and put you on the
screen here
is that a thing hello twitchers
all right uh matt says matt's a plumber
let's see what happens if i hit to
present
putting you on screen oh look at that
i just put matt's comment on screen
on screen could i do that with another
one
present on screen
let's see how that works
that's a cool feature you're seeing this
i can take your comment and then uh just
post it to the uh
well this changes everything
why did it take so long for somebody to
invent that feature
okay now i'm starting to get excited
starting to get excited
now this has a feature where i can
invite people
and i don't know but i'd like to invite
you to be on the screen
is that possible
let's see
any new flashlights in my collection
somebody's asking
no i i threw away most of my flashlights
they all went bad
flashlights don't last long all right so
it doesn't look like
i can invite any of you directly to be
on here
but i've got this feature where i can
invite people
to be a participant or a director
start typing to invite somebody is this
going to take it from my
contacts or is it going to take it from
the people who are on the
on this let's see i will start typing
one of your names
all right that person doesn't exist
two
let's see i'm gonna i'm gonna take
somebody who's
whose name i can type into my invite
people box
and i'm going to say who are you
james james let's see if you can
pop up
james rook they dim the screen just when
i want to
see it so that's not ideal
okay so if i type your name in it
doesn't pop up i don't really know what
names are
showing here so it's auto filling names
but i don't know from what database it
is getting those names it's not my
contacts
and it's not the people who are signed
on right now
so who could i invite if it's neither a
contact
or somebody who's on the live stream
perhaps tv are you watching me
i bet you are all right i'll just talk
to the developers right now
all right here i am i'm signed on and
i'm saying to myself hey it looks like
you've got this feature
where i could split the screen and add
somebody
and then i see a feature that says
invite people
and i and i start typing in
somebody i know and it doesn't go to my
contacts so i don't know
so you need a little bit extra help here
for people like me
um let me see let me just look around
see if there's some obvious
interface on here notifiers
comments notifiers
um somebody says audio is good but video
is choppy
so um that might be my
my limiter here because uh one of the
things that the
apps tv interface says is that
if you do a normal
normal video you'll do better than if
you do
high quality so i set it to high quality
to try to break it
um i've got i've got incredible wi-fi in
my house
so i'm pretty strapped with wi-fi so i
know it's not in my end
but they did the app the app itself does
warn you that you'll have some
performance problems
so
well you asked for it here it comes
i do love this feature work and i can
add a comment
so i guess um so i'm getting some
feedback here says that the youtube
started smooth but got choppy
uh but the overlays in the audio are
smooth
all right so i'm on a brand new
high-end mac with wi-fi speeds
through the roof uh so i know the
problem isn't on my end
so that might be the that might be the
limitation here if
i stream to maybe two services at the
same time but
what if i were to stream to one service
um
here's a good question
yeah let's there's a little lag before
that shows up
could you ever make a loc locals michael
lesson
how to get an immediate family member
who watches cnn and believes the fake
news
well i don't know if i've ever seen
anybody solve that
i do sometimes try to do the high ground
maneuver
where i talk about the benefit of seeing
both sides
if you want to sort of slide it under
the door here's the best advice i can
give you
my book loser think has a section on
pretty much exactly that which
is how to determine uh what is bs and
what is not
and one of the sections in there says
don't what don't get all your news from
one source either just the left or just
the right
and so that'll do a better job of
explaining why you should broaden at
least your
exposure to news so since it's not
entirely about just that you might be
able to slide it in because they'll
think oh
here's a book about a bunch of things
that i like and then suddenly they're
going to read that
that they're hypnotizing themselves by
reading
watching just one news source
all right um
invite user
what does that mean so i just
invited the user but i don't know what
happened
so now i don't have the option to
put that comment on screen but thank you
i think somebody
sent me 15 cents
all right well i've got company so i'm
going to sign off now
and i'll do a little more research on
this
