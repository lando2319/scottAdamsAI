good morning everybody and welcome to
the decline of civilization
apparently everything's falling apart
but we'll put it back together again
your mental state will be so much better
when I'm done with you today I know it's
sort of a disturbing day but we'll make
it better that's what we do and if you'd
like to make it better all you need is a
copper among or a glass of tanker
chalice or style a canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine is the day the
thing that makes everything better
including the banking system you don't
believe me watch this we're going to
take a sip and everything will be better
go
yeah
I
Can you feel it I feel like deposits
just went up
and quality credit quality improved a
little bit
it might not show up in the data but I
could feel it
and my lived experience is far more
important than your damn data that's for
sure
about the most important thing that's
happening today if you've seen the news
you know that the Academy Awards
happened last night
yeah we'll talk about that banking thing
too
we'll talk about the banking thing gotta
do that sure but the most important
thing was that there was a huge award
show for uh people who made movies
now I was not aware of this but did you
know that there had been any movies made
recently
did you know that they're still making
movies
has anybody watched a movie in the past
year
I mean I remember Top Gun
but that's the only one I watched I
didn't watch anything else this year I
can't even name one
I mean I've heard some names oh there's
some Avatar Two or something there well
how about that but the important thing
is that people of color want a lot of
awards
and that is far more important than any
other theme
and my favorite is that uh
my actually my favorite actress in the
entire planet
one
I guess the big Academy Award for best
actress Michelle yo
am I the only one who has her way before
she won this she has always been my
number one favorite actress in the
entire planet
I just love anything she does she's just
so good
yeah I'll watch anything she said like
as soon as I hear she's in it's like all
right I'm in I'll watch that so I'm
pretty happy that my favorite actress of
in the entire planet
um one so that's good and then what does
the Press do to reduce totally reduce
her accomplishment
they report that she is the first the
first person who openly
identifies as Asian to win
she's the first one to openly identify
as Asian to win
could there be anything more demeaning
to her accomplishment
she literally just she just ran the
table of every of every actress on the
planet Earth
right I mean given that Hollywood is a
is a global thing I mean she's just one
against all the other actresses on the
planet Earth
and what and what do we say about her oh
she's the second Asian I mean the first
one didn't openly identify because in
those days you couldn't but she's the
first openly identified like that's the
headline seriously that's the headline
foreign
to me I would just be pissed if I won
the greatest the greatest award you
could win in in my craft
and and all they reported was my
ethnicity like that's the lead
I would be pissed
how about she was just the best one
about that how about she was just the
best one
crazy all right well today as I've been
telling you is the first day of the
Dilbert reborn series we'll get to
banking next
so Dilbert as you know got canceled in
the polite world
and disgraced artist Scott Adams that's
what I call myself now
my new name for myself is disgraced
cartoonist Scott Adams
so disgrace cartoonist Scott Adams
me
has moved to the locals platform it's
the only place you'll be able to see
Dilbert the new ones but the new ones
will be called Dilbert reborn it will be
it will continue daily as it always did
I'll just be self self-publishing
self-syndicating through the locals
platform
and
uh if you went to dilbert.com today
where it has always been running until
now
uh you'll see a redirect to the locals
platform
so just go to dilbert.com and click the
the locals
button for well it'll say Dilbert reborn
just follow that if you want to sign up
it's a subscription service now I was
worried a little bit that something
might go wrong because I had two points
of you know possible going wrong one was
at the dilbert.com site wouldn't show
the redirect
because we weren't sure that technically
what we did would work on the first try
and then I was worried that there might
be too much traffic or there'd be a
problem on the receiving side if the
locals platform got overwhelmed but I'm
happy to say we did not have a problem
with uh one of those systems
both of them didn't work
so dilbert.com was not redirecting
anywhere when I woke up
and the local system was not taking new
subscribers
so the most important day of my life
wasn't completely wrong so nobody
actually signed up for a little while
but it looks like it's fixed
so when when people woke up
it was the waking up part that I had to
wait for when people woke up on both
sides uh quickly fixed so now we've got
uh both sides working
and everything's back online
but
I want to talk about a larger theme when
we get to it but let's talk about
Silicon Valley Bank
the first question do you want to know
since I'm going to be talking about this
bank is Scott how much money did you
have in that bank Silicon Valley Bank
and I would like to give you one
definitive answer to that question
I'm not the guy who puts any money in
the 19th largest bank
any questions
I have a degree in economics an MBA and
I worked in banking for years
I'm not going to put my money in the
19th biggest bank
I'm sorry
that was a mistake
every person who put their money in the
19th biggest bank in today's environment
they were taking on a little bit of a
risk
seems to me now it looks like the
depositors will be made whole and I'm
happy about that actually I think that
was the right decision
but uh no I did not have any money in
the 19th largest bank so you might ask
yourself who would who would but part of
the business model of that bank
was I think they would offer I don't
know discounts on your mortgage if you
had your business there and also your
personal there and so and sometimes the
um the Venture capitalists would
recommend it because there was some kind
of you know Collective benefit from you
know having all your business in one
place so it was a combination of you
know unique special benefits that that
one bank and that one situation had and
not something that is common but what is
common yes I will if I take the
the approach that apparently the uh so
here's here's one take on it
so there are a number of people have
different filters on this or frames so
each of these are true but they're not
the whole story right so one of the
frames that's true but not part of the
whole story is that the Fed
tried to convince people that interest
rates were transitory where inflation
was transitory and that the inflation
would be you know fine once we got past
the transitory part now if you believe
that
and you thought oh okay then you'd
probably think interest rates wouldn't
go up that much
and then you would make a huge purchase
of fixed-rate government instruments
that paid a very little interest
but that's all you needed at the time
the only thing that would get you in
trouble is if the rest of the world
raised its interest rates while you were
locked in at this tiny tiny little one
point something rate
and then you'd be underwater
so that's what happened
but there's some notion that there might
be a lot of other banks that did the
same thing
that doesn't mean everything else about
the other Banks is similar so they might
not have the same structural problems in
terms of how many
what percentage of their deposits are uh
you know over 250 000 and therefore
uninsured that sort of thing so there
are all kinds of other differences but
there is a general problem that there
might be a bunch of banks that locked
into low interest rate stuff because
they believe the government the Fed
so apparently listening to Janet Yellen
would crush your back if you just
believed what she said
now I think that's just one frame
I don't I don't think that's the one I
would
prefer you know that I don't think
that's the window I'm going to be
looking through exactly
to me it looks like a combination of
complexity
meaning there was something about their
bank that was different than others and
there were other Dynamics There Was You
know the general flow of capital
Etc
but also there seemed to be some
incompetence
would you agree
uh it seems to be the uh there is an
incompetence problem
and have you noticed that there's a
general incompetence problem
just everywhere
have you tried to get a customer service
help since the pandemic
something changed
something changed you know before the
pandemic yeah we always complained about
customer service
but at least the person on the other end
knew their job
you know you just complain about one
thing another but now it's really
different
if you get customer service they don't
even know their jobs they don't even
know the basics the most you know top
five things that you do in that job
the the competence level is just crazy
now
and I think there's a reason
and it looks like this
here is a controversial uh it looks like
a bell curve but I'm going to call it
I'm going to call it competence don't
get caught up on IQ competence is
whether you can do the thing that's your
job right so it's not about how smart
you are it's whether you have all the
capability to do your job right you
don't need to be a rocket scientist you
just need to be capable in your job
for most of History you had some people
who basically couldn't do anything they
were just the lowest capability for
whatever reason they might be not as
smart they might be on drugs for
whatever reason they just were not
capable maybe mental mental insanity
and most people who were in this you
know big normal phase like everybody
could sort of do their own job everybody
could figure out how to get a mortgage
if they needed it you know that you can
figure out the basics of Life how to buy
a car you know everybody could get that
stuff and then there were some freaks
who were doing things that none of us
could do right they're in they're doing
quantum physics and so they can do
everything but there aren't many of them
here's what's changed
of course technology has made the uh has
spread the number of people who are
incompetent because it's just harder to
do stuff now would you agree when when I
go to sign into an app
do you know what I used to do here's
what to do
password
username
good
now if I sign into an app it's more like
cracking it like I'm more like a safe
cracker I'm like hmm
we'll try that we'll try the password
first all right all right password
password okay it's requiring
authentication uh it requires me to
download an authenticator app okay but
my authenticator app I had is uh out of
date so it's not working but damn it
I've got two things that are apps they
call they're called authenticator I
can't remember did I use the old
authenticator or the new one have I
updated the authenticator so then I use
it but for some reason the authenticator
number isn't working and then I try the
other authenticator but that seems to be
the wrong app so I go back and I try it
again and I try it again and I try it
again and on the fourth try it works
that's just
opening an app
just opening
an app
it's like it's like I have to play in
the afternoon
you know if somebody says to me hey
Scott can you you know check something
on let's say your payroll system or
something like that do you know what I
first think
oh
how in the world will I find enough time
to hack into that account
hack into it that's actually what I call
it now I don't call it signing up I
don't call her signing in I call it
hacking it because you've got to be you
go you're on Google figuring out what
other people have done but of course of
course Google is just full of helpful
advice for menu choices that you don't
have
right
so anyway
the just the pace of Technology
makes everything more complicated
so you figure that they're just fewer
and fewer people who can do the basics
of life
and then because there are more there
are more apps and more possibilities
they're just more possibilities in life
right
now if I said to you hey send me some
money
in the old days you'd say all right all
right a check and put it in this
envelope but now I'm like okay do I use
venmo no venmo's got a limit on it but
it's connected to the wrong account but
I can use Google pay or I could use Zell
what is Zell anyway remind me what Zell
is I know what it is I'm just pretending
and now you're like okay should I just
send Bitcoin and what's happening with
my coinbase and like everything is just
insane now the level of complexity to do
the simplest freaking thing is just
through the roof
so some of it is just we've got new and
better stuff
it's not so much that it's a technology
problem it's just more stuff
so everything you do is just more
more regulations
more rules more security problems more
updates more patches
everything's more
so suddenly the number of people who can
just sort of survive in the world is
just way less way less
but
what happens if you're a business
and you have to layer on something like
ESG
so now you're not looking at just
profits you're not looking at just
profits you've got to reduce your carbon
footprint you've got to increase your
diversity at the same time you're
working on profits do you think those
will always be compatible
they can be
that ideally yes in a perfect world yes
they could all be compatible
in the real world do you think they are
in the real world they could be
compatible
but it causes extra complexity I found
somebody who would be perfect for this
job
are they are they perfect
or maybe if you hire that perfect person
you might be working against your ESG
goals right
so which is more important do you need
your diversity or this person had just
the right experience well now it's a
little complicated and if you do that is
it going to increase or decrease your
carbon footprint wow
so as soon as you add uh all the extra
complexities in theory
your average company should become far
less capable not because they're hiring
you know minorities that's not what I'm
saying I'm saying that when you add a
whole new set of requirements
be they government requirements or be
they World economic Forum
recommendations it doesn't matter where
it comes from you can make it up
yourself but if you had a whole layer of
other priorities
to fight with your current priorities
you should expect
far less capability
right now that doesn't mean that's
what's I'm not suggesting that's what
happened to the Silicon Valley Bank you
know that that's sort of a right-leaning
I would say that's more of a political
attack
but
take the politics out of it you cannot
argue with the fact that as soon as you
add goals on top of your existing goals
that you have a new level of complexity
that will paralyze people who are not
that smart now if you're really smart
does any of this matter
well if you're really really capable you
could probably make all of it work
you probably could somebody like Google
for example you have apple highly
capable companies they can get the best
Engineers of of every demographic group
people want to work there yeah you yeah
if you're if you work at Apple you could
probably manage all of this complexity
but not everybody can
so in my opinion
uh and then then you imagine that you've
got uh
the Biden Administration which is
adding another burden on business
so remember did you see uh Kevin O'Leary
talking about some states are
uninvestable
do you remember there was an interview
in which he said he said on CNN and they
didn't like it at all he said I got to
tell you I'm paraphrasing but New York
and California and Massachusetts are
uninvestable
uninvestable
he will not open a business there
because the business climate because of
Democrat policies basically makes the
taxes too high and the regulation is
impossible and it doesn't make sense
there are actually states in the United
States you can't invest in if you're
paying attention
amazing like how did we get there now
I'm sure that that's you know the
regulations
regulations taxes
so what it feels like is when I watch
these shows I watch these old shows
about how the pyramids were built and
nobody can figure it out because the
current residents of Egypt definitely do
not know how to build the pyramid
without using modern tools
and so I think to myself
how was it that a society once knew how
to do something impressive
and then they lost that ability
isn't that weird
but then I see us doing it like like it
feels like we're moving toward absolute
stupidity
like we won't be able to do normal
things
like we're losing the ability to do
normal things
the complexity is just crazy
yes all right well more about Silicon
Valley Bank
um so it immediately broke out along
political lines
people who wanted to establish their
conservative credentials said don't save
that Bank full of left-leaning Democrats
and a bunch of rich people and VCS and
what about my what about Middle America
and don't save them and then other
people said but wait a minute
it's not about politics it's not so much
about politics this time hold on hold on
let's take the politics out and see what
it looks like now if you take the
politics out some would say right uh I
will round out the opinion so if I'm
leaving one out just wait for it
so some would say no no it's more about
if people see this one Bank fail it
might cause a run on the other Banks so
it's really not even about this Bank
if you're focusing on what's happening
on this Bank you're missing the bigger
picture
but then other people say
who's telling us that the people who
have deposits in that bank
seems Seems like a coincidence that the
people you would imagine are most likely
to have money in that bank are also in
favor of of saving it huh Venture
capitalists so
so you have to watch out for you know
self-interest right which is why I start
by saying I did not have any money in
that bank so at least that part of my
bias will not show
and
yeah so here's yeah Bill Ackman I think
was more of a uh system Focus let's save
the system now it appears and I
predicted you do you remember I
predicted over the weekend
that the most likely outcome
is that because the government could
stop a run on banks just by saying we'll
guarantee you whatever we need to
guarantee and they needed to
and they could
that it would happen and here we are so
they could do it they needed to do it
and then they did it so it wasn't wasn't
my hardest prediction but I suppose it
could have gone the other way
so some are calling it a bailout
and others are saying it is not
now the the argument that is not a
bailout
says that the bondholders and the
investors in the bank lost everything
and that's not going to be there's
there's no compensation for that
so it's not a bailout of the the people
who made the mistakes that's important
right the people who made the mistakes
are wiped out
the people who were innocent customers
will be made whole
even though you could argue they should
have known better
but you know what my argument is against
should have known better
well maybe they should have known that
The Regulators were watching the banks
this was a government failure in my
opinion
to me they looked under regulated
wouldn't you say
it looked under regulated because
somebody should have seen this coming
from a mile away
so the government up
and they're paying for it I'm okay with
that the government
messed up
and now the government is saying well at
least guarantee it now remember
guaranteeing it doesn't mean they pay
anything
guaranteeing if you guarantee it it
means you won't pay anything you know
because there won't be a run on the
banks the general Banks now
it's the real problem
is not just that this specific bank had
a unique special circumstances which
they did
uh we'll see if it spreads anywhere else
but in my opinion the government going
in strong and guaranteeing at least that
the depositors will be made whole was
exactly the right decision
um now does that mean that I agree with
government intervention no I believe the
proper role of the government is that
the country's insurance policy
that I've always thought of the
government that way the government's
your insurance policy
if you have to use it you have to use it
but you don't want to you know your your
first choice is that the government has
nothing to do with your life at all
right at least negative and and then you
know if something bigger than you
happens then they can come in like an
insurance policy
now that's just my view of it I'm not
I'm not selling that view to anybody
else but my personal view is that
government as insurance policy is not a
bad idea
not a bad idea
so we certainly want them when there's a
natural disaster right
so what's the difference if there's a
natural disaster we we say send that
government in and go fix that those are
Americans suffering you know we're not
being political we don't get political
in a hurricane do we I guess we do
because we suck but we don't get as
political when there's a natural
disaster and that's at least most of us
can turn that off for about 10 minutes
you know maybe the politicians can't but
the citizens can I mean when there's a
hurricane
no citizens I've ever heard said don't
help them because they're Democrats or
Republicans I've never heard that
so not from citizens yeah and even in
East uh Palestine I don't think there
were good people of any political stripe
who didn't want those people helped
that's what I think
anyway
um
more about this Silicon Valley Bank
um do you think that some of some of
what's going on is just that
Republicans and conservatives are mad at
Democrats and it looks like a Democrat
bank with a bunch of democrat depositors
now that of course is not true
you know every bank would have a mix of
all kinds of people
they'd have a mix of ethnicities and a
mix of political but probably the way
people think of Silicon Valley is a
bunch of Democrats
so
I would I would be a little embarrassed
a little embarrassed
for my country if any of that is seeping
into this decision
if this is political
we suck
right this is just a it's a disaster
it's just like you know it's not just
like but in in some ways in terms of the
the country needs to save some part of
something it is like a natural disaster
to me right the the people most of the
people involved had nothing to do with
it we're just completely innocent
victims
yeah so I think the right decision is
for the government to come in strong and
and protect depositors but not owners of
Banks and I'm happy with how that turned
out
all right but uh let's check the stock
market I think the stock market will
give you the best idea
of what's going on so let's look at spy
so that would be the Fortune 500 so it's
down half a point which would be a
normal day move
oh it's up is my app Anna
let's see if I refresh my app's like 15
minutes late
but do you even
do you have different uh
the minds us down
do you have a delay on your app or do I
have a delay on my app anyway the point
is whether it's up or down it's not up
or down much
it's not really more than an ordinary
day
if the stock market is not moving more
than an ordinary day
I think we're going to be okay
I think we're going to be okay
yeah
I'm looking at less than half a point
move on something that should have been
scary
so it looks like the the stock market
the collective wisdom of the crowds is
it will be okay
now if the collective wisdom of stock
people
says we'll be okay that probably matches
the public
right they're a little more
sophisticated than the public in general
but it's also the people who have money
right the people who don't have money it
doesn't matter if they try to withdraw
their money they don't have or not but
if you're in the stock market you're
probably exactly the same people who are
putting money in Banks because you have
money
so those people seem to be
fairly calm
yeah the market is still assessing but
that I don't worry about
I don't worry about a careful assessment
I worry about a panic and it looks like
the government acted to stop the Panic
now
remember I always tell you that the
internet dads
are really keeping everything together
I don't think everybody realizes this
yet how true this is now when I say the
internet dads I don't mean just men and
it's not not gender specific I'm using
it as sort of a a dad Vibe you know
somebody just taking control that sort
of thing and what I watched
at least play out in public is the
smartest people in America
realizing that they had to get involved
now as smart people get involved in lots
of stuff but I think the smartest Among
Us I don't include myself in this topic
I think the smartest Among Us said all
right this is my job I'm not going to
delegate this one you don't want to
delegate that and I I saw the smartest
people just become more visible
you know and they weighed in with their
specific opinions and I believe that we
got a result that would be compatible
with
I say most of the smart dads I know
Vivek
ramaswamy was more you know let him fall
and so he was he was sort of outside the
mainstream dad mode but I think Dad mode
just saves the country
and again I don't mean just male I'm
using it generically yeah I think Dad
mode because those smartest people well
let me say I'll be very specific
I tuned into a spaces you know the audio
thing on Twitter and I was listening to
a famous investor Bill Ackman
talking about you know where things were
where they're gonna go now because
he's someone whose opinion on this topic
I would trust because he's in you know
he's right in the center of this
business
um and he was thinking that we could get
through it
that made me think so too
right so I thought well okay if this uh
if this internet dad is happy and then I
look at people like David sacks who is
arguing with Vivek they were disagreeing
quite a bit on this but
I felt as though I felt as though I
discounted anybody who was running for
office
so I've told you I'm supporting Vivek
for president primarily on one topic
he's just tough on fentanyl in Mexico
and I disagreed with his take on this I
disagreed with his take but he's also in
a political Realm
and I think on this decision I didn't
care about anybody in politics
right don't show me a Democrat running
for office don't show me a republican
running for office I discount those
opinions completely I don't discount
um the smartest people in Silicon Valley
I don't discount that at all even though
I know they have a personal stake in
some cases a personal stake
I still think they're closer to what
makes sense than what's political
yeah so I always discount politicians
for a technical analysis like this
um lots of bags probably have the same
problem so we'll see how this plays out
so far I trust
the
I I trust that we're going to work our
way through it because I think the the
smartest people are just asserting
themselves right now and because they
have to
I saw a tweet I guess this was from Fox
Business had a headline that said B of A
and Lowe's sponsoring CRT training that
uh quote urges whites to seed power to
people of color
now I'm sure that's taken out of context
but of course you ask yourself what
possible contacts could make that okay
like how much imagination would you have
to wrap around that to say well in this
one context that might actually make
sense
no not really
nope nope now with b and a and lows are
teaching people to put let's say race
over capability
would you buy stock in B of A or lows
knowing that they have publicly signaled
they're no longer valuing competence
competence as their highest standard
their highest standard now is who has
the power
says so it's from their own Trading
who who would invest in that
now if it sounds to you like I'm saying
oh I don't want you know people of color
to have opportunity or no now I'm just
saying that if if the way you get it
is by making your company's uh no longer
no longer capable of running
then maybe that wasn't the best path
that's all maybe there's a better way
all right
um so a tweet from representative JB
Raskin
um
I
I'm just going to read you the tweet I
feel like sometimes there's no
commentary needed I remember he's a
notable uh Democrat who's pushed a
number of hoaxes and he says America
must reject the gop's dangerous nihilism
about the impossibility of separating
truth from lies a derangement brought on
by the Donald Trump but now infecting
their whole party
our system of democratic governance
rests on truth and facts
not lies and
conspiracy theories
so I uh I retweeted with a comment and
attached the now over 20 lists of the
hoaxes the Democrats including
representative Jamie Raskin have played
on the country over the past five years
there are over 20 major hoaxes now some
not so major that
his party played on the world
and they still do and to this day and
he's complaining about truth
now if there's one thing I could tell
you
truth would destroy the country
you don't want truth
you don't
the the banking problem is a perfect
example
if if everybody involved in the banking
just told you that the cold hard facts
there would be a run on banks
the what there would be a run on banks
if nobody told you everything would be
fine
does everybody does anybody think that
every that anybody knows for sure that
everything will be fine nobody knows
that
no I think it's true that's my honest
opinion that it will be fine but nobody
knows
so I'm giving you an optimistic view of
the future because it's more functional
if I can if I can infect you with some
optimism it will stop a bank run
it will stop the rung but if I gave you
a whole bunch of facts about you know
the stability of the system
and you were unaware that people will be
you know acting in various heroic ways
to try to make sure that those risks
don't you know become real so you're not
going to see what people would do to fix
something right because that's unknown
so if all I did is tell you all the
problems with the system
you would go and try to turn your money
into gold immediately
but we don't have a world that works on
facts and you don't want one you do not
want a world that works on facts it has
to work on right is
the only thing that keeps Us Alive now
too much of it and the wrong kind seems
negative but you don't want to take away
the operating system of society which is
lies exaggerations promises you can't
keep optimism that isn't isn't accurate
uh you know down downplaying the things
that are really bad
right the moment you think that truth is
your goal you're lost
now we all prefer truth
if you ask me I'll say oh yeah I'd much
rather have the truth but I'm also not
an idiot I see that most of the world
couldn't handle the truth and it would
just crash the system so no the truth is
terrible you don't want the truth but
that doesn't mean that every piece of BS
is good for you so I would agree with JB
representative for Raskin that there's
too much but don't get rid of
all of it it's sort of a necessary
lubricant
of society
all right
um I finally figured out and I guess
this was not the biggest mystery in the
world exactly why Tick Tock has not
already been banned by the government
can you guess why tick knock Tick Tock
has not already been banned by the
government
just take a guess
because it's good for Democrats right
now I didn't know that the Democrats
were thinking in those terms but it did
seem to be that because of the
demographic of tick tock users young
people tend to be Democrats more likely
that it probably helped them to have
that that vehicle that they could reach
those voters now did you know that 2022
was record turnout for young people of
The Tick Tock using age did you know
that
you think it's related
I don't necessarily think it's related
it might be related to abortion or
something like that
um
but I wonder
I wonder
did Tick Tock make people more likely to
vote
it can
if you don't think he has the power to
do that you're completely wrong yeah
Tick Tock has the power to change how
many people vote
did you know that
because it's persuasive and they can
decide what you see and what you don't
see
so if they want you to vote they can
make sure that your feed is filled with
more things that are political and would
encourage you to vote and scare you so
you have to vote right
um
anyway so the reason that the tick tock
is not already banned when it's so
obvious the right thing to do I mean
this is just easy question am I wrong
bearing Tick Tock is not a hard question
the Chinese government can control what
our kids see they have total control of
what they see more of and less of even
the Chinese children can't use it
they're not allowed
it's too dangerous
all right
but it's because the Democrats are
saying directly they don't think they
can win races without it
the Democrats the Consultants Etc are
saying it directly yeah without Tick
Tock we'd have a lot we'd have trouble
winning
so there it is
your Democrats have literally
they've literally
preferred China's well-being over yours
that's not exaggeration
because to the extent that they know
that China can influence Tick Tock and
of course they should know that it's
pretty obvious and the fact that they
want to not change that situation
because it's good for them politically
they're not on your side
a nice picture they're not on your side
at all anybody who wants to keep Tick
Tock to get elected has favored China's
well-being over the United States
I'm not wrong about that that's exactly
what's happening they've literally
favored China China's well-being over
the United States so they can get
elected
what would be a lower level of ethical
uh Behavior I can't think of them can
you think of anything that would be less
ethical than that
literally allowing your most dangerous
adversaries to have control over the
minds of your own children so you can
get elected
you you would delegate the raising of
your children to the Chinese Communists
so you can get a few votes that's what
the Democrats are doing
I'm not making that up let me ask you is
that framing too hyperbolic
was that hyperbole or was that a
description of fact
that a Democrat will leave the the
education to a large degree
of their own children their own children
and grandkids
they will risk their own children and
grandchildren's
so they can get elected and it's not
even it's just like some votes it's not
like a lot of votes yeah that's actually
happening in the real world
right in front of you with no there's
nobody hiding it
just think about the remember how I kept
saying why is there no argument for
keeping tick tock
you know Fox News would have on this
bipartisan you know two senators oh
here's here's a republican who says band
take dog and here's a Democrat who says
ban Tick Tock and then I say okay good
now I'm very curious to see the opposite
side of the argument so I can't wait
until they have a Democrat on who wants
to keep tick tock
have you ever seen one
anywhere
CNN MSNBC
Fox News
no
have you seen an article Wall Street
Journal
have you seen any Democrat say I'd like
to say that Tick Tock should remain
legal
nope
do you know why they literally can't say
it in public
it's the policy of the United States
it's not a state secret
and they're so embarrassed they can't
even say it in public
do you think they should be embarrassed
yes yes they should be embarrassed if
you can't even make your argument in
public and I'm not wrong there is no
Democrat who has made an argument for
tick tock in public because they can't
it would be thoroughly unethical what
they're doing instead is say well let's
let's study it until the next election's
over they're going to study it until the
election's over and they're doing that
right in front of your face
right in front of you nothing's being
hidden here this is right in front of
you we would like China to be a big part
of the next election
oh my God
oh my God yeah let's let's have China be
a big player in the next election and
purposely
purposely now they're not purposely
wanting China to do it but they're
purposely creating the situation which
they know gives China a tremendous
control over the election
now here's the question do you think
China prefers Democrats
what do you think do you think they
prefer Democrats
well you know you could argue that they
don't care there is an argument that
Biden's been tough on them
right Biden has been tough on China and
the Democrats even you know Schumer et
cetera are still are kind of tough on
China
so it's not as clear to me that China
wants Republicans to win but what is
clear is if they wanted Republicans to
win they could make it happen
that's clear
they can make it happen
doesn't mean they will
but your election is no longer in your
hands it looks like China has full
control of the next election and I say
full control because anything that can
move the electorate by two percent is
going to determine who the next
president is you don't think Tick Tock
can move uh move us by two percent
yes they can
yes they can it has exactly the kind of
system that could move two percent of
the public completely
totally
all right
um
so I think it was last week I showed a
clip that I just took off the news so I
know it's not I know it wasn't
um
manipulated you know sometimes you see
manipulated things where the slow down
somebody's speech to make them look like
they're drunk or something but I'm
pretty sure the video of Kamala Harris
appearing to be inebriated while she was
speaking in public now that's my opinion
in my opinion she appeared to be
inebriated and so I tweeted it to ask
other people what they thought and there
was some some who thought no they said
oh she's just like that but I think at
least three quarters of people who
responded said oh yeah obviously
inebriated it's obvious
Now where's the push back to that
where's the pushback
so we've got this banking crisis
and the uh the confidence of the economy
the confidence of the country depends on
leadership more than anything else
so we've got a leader who can't put two
words together
and it's never clear if he's going to
finish his sentence and his backup
nobody's questioning the fact that she
appears to be drunk in public on a
regular basis
nobody's even questioning that that's
true you know I mean 75 percent of you
are perfectly willing to say that's what
it looks like now we don't know right if
I said I know she's inebriated that
would be too far
I'm saying she acts exactly like
somebody who's inebriated
so it doesn't even matter if she's not
do you want a vice president who acts
like a drunk when she's not that's not
better
that's not an upgrade
so we have the weakest leaders we've
ever had if you look at him as a pair
it's the weakest leadership we've ever
had in terms of confidence at a time
when we need confidence
now is it my imagination
or has absolutely everything in the
country gotten worse since Biden took
over
am I imagining that so we're in a war
inflation is through the roof inflation
would have been bad under Trump you know
that right we still would have had
inflation because we spent a lot but I
don't think it would have been as I
like I think he would have he would have
been at least putting his foot on it a
little bit harder I don't know if it
would make a difference but we could
certainly say it hasn't gone well under
Biden I think we have more racial
division
uh we didn't have Bank scares under
Trump
um I remember a time when movies and TV
were watchable
do you remember when movies and TV were
watchable and now they really aren't
um
and then as Captain O'Leary says that
states the blue states have made
business just uninvestable the states
are on the festival those are really big
things
those are really big things and I don't
know
that they would be worse under Trump
what do you think
do you think a trump government would
have
saved any of these problems
or maybe at least the Ukraine war
you know he wouldn't change movies but
yeah so maybe I feel like the country is
a alcoholic
and it's been drinking the CRT and the
ESG and the Dai juice
and now it's just drunken incompetent
it just drank all the social media juice
all right here's a a little anecdote and
I want to see if anybody can back up
this anecdote
right
so yesterday I talked to a young person
17 year old family family member
and the family member said
that she had deleted her social media
accounts
just to see if she'd feel better
in one day of no social media she
reported an immense change in her mood
and her enjoyment of life
and she said I was so productive today
you know did a whole bunch of things
that she wanted to get taken care of you
know school and other things and felt
really good it's like wow so pretty so
productive and those days normally would
have been set you know sitting in one
place
or maybe walking or something but just
scrolling
like that would be a normal weekend day
would just be
scrolling and maybe maybe you see some
people and by getting rid of her social
media she couldn't stop talking about
how happier like how free her brain was
now has anybody done that
has anybody tried that I guess I guess
you wouldn't be here if you had
but do you know anybody who's tried it
you know any do you know any teens who
have gone cold turkey on social media
because I'm wondering if if that needs
to start as a trend
I don't know how you start a trend
because if it's not a trend that's on
social media they'll never see it right
but I feel as if in the same way that
the you know the the so-called pure
Bloods were happy they didn't get
vaccinated
I wonder if there's going to be a time
when the non-social media users look
like the best
um the best ones to date
I wonder if you'll look more attractive
if you're not using social media after a
certain amount of time
imagine you're looking for you let's say
you're a teenage girl you're looking for
a boyfriend
you got two choices and you like them
both
one boyfriend lives on social media
the other one deleted all social media
which one's going to cheat on you
right which one's going to cheat on you
the one that has no social media the one
that uses it constantly it's easy
yeah all things being equal the person
with no social media is the star now
suppose you think things might someday
go wrong
May someday go wrong and then the person
you broke up with is still on social
media
what kind of BS do they post well it
might not be good for you
that's a downside but the person who has
no social media is not going to post
anything on social media
do you think anybody's gonna if you're
dating somebody and they see something
on social media that maybe you should be
doing
how about that you know all these girls
on social media I see they're doing XYZ
and I really like that
and then your girlfriend's like uh what
yeah they're all they're all doing this
thing and a certain kind of makeup or
whatever you should do that
that doesn't work that that's not a good
relationship sort of thing I saw
something on social media you should be
more like that that actually happens
by somebody who doesn't have social
media is just gonna say I like you
I like you that's about it
so I do think that there's a possibility
because everything you know goes too far
before it comes back the social media
may have reached a point where it's just
obviously affecting your mental health
and that the smarter young people are
just going to ditch it
or maybe take time off from it
might be like a social media diet like
only look at it for an hour a day or
something because you can't really live
without it in the modern world it seems
I don't think I could
but I could figure out a way to not look
at it
you know what's weird when uh my little
Scandal broke I'm sure you're all aware
of it when my Scandal broke all I had to
do was not look at social media and I
felt fine
did you know that
if I if I just lived in my house
and didn't check my phone or didn't look
at any articles about me
it didn't bother me at all
it didn't bother me at all but social
media created this whole artificial
world that if I had entered it I
probably would have felt bad
because it was this whole ugly bubble
that started and I just said well I just
won't get in there so there are a whole
bunch of you know notable people who
wrote nasty articles about me
didn't see him
I mean I saw some headlines sometimes I
was like I'm not interested
so
um
that's where we're at
let's talk about people Bridge Edge
um Rasmussen poll says uh uh what
percent
half of the country or something doesn't
want him thinks he should resign because
of the East Palestine situation here's
my problem with Pete budigens
uh I I've always liked him for being
smart
and for having a consultant background
because it means he could at least
understand you know complicated stuff
and can figure out Solutions Maybe
but
the East Palestine situation really
showed his biggest weakness
his biggest weakness is he doesn't seem
like he has a heart
of course he does but in terms of a
leadership vibe
uh Trump showed that he cared and people
believed it
would you agree
Trump showed empathy
by showing up right showing up is As you
know in relationships and in work
showing up
can be eighty percent of the solution
right or 80 of the message the message
so showing up is big
but Pete has this problem he's a little
uh academic and intellectual and a
little bit too much of a consultant I
never once felt that
judge cared too much
did you
like I just didn't feel like he cared
and when he said you have to understand
that there are all kinds of trained
derailments all the time
then I really didn't think he cared but
he does right so I'm not I'm not mind
reading I'm saying that a leader needs
to project empathy not just have it he
probably has it I'm not saying he's like
a heartless robot but not everybody can
project it
and this was one of those situations
where the people needed to know that the
people in charge cared
but I didn't didn't show up it looks
like he didn't care Buddha judge talked
about it like a consultant
which makes you think he doesn't care
Trump showed up
totally unambiguous
what Trump did left no doubt
about what he was trying to communicate
we don't again we don't know what's in
his heart or his mind but what he
communicated was crystal clear
crystal clear I'm going to put my time
into this and my money too
so
yeah you don't usually think the
Secretary of Transportation needs to be
a leader
more than you know more than a wonk but
there may be more and more situations
especially with
um
you know any kind of Transportation by
air or self-driving cars we have a whole
bunch of
Transportation related things in the
pipeline
the self-driving cars being the biggest
one I think that you're really going to
need some leadership from the
transportation area so I do think he's
the wrong person
yeah I don't know if you should resign
but in I think we actually need a leader
who can convey you know the emotions and
empathy of leadership and I don't think
he has that gear
I think he's a smart guy probably I
think he cares I assume so uh he just
doesn't project leadership and I don't
think we can do without it I don't think
we can do without leadership from his
department and maybe before we could
maybe before we could
I do say some things twice sometimes
somebody pointed that out recently I
didn't notice it until somebody pointed
it down
well I'll be talking to Larry Elder
um I think on Thursday I'm going to talk
to him and maybe it it airs the next day
it'll be recorded
um and he retweeted my video which I
reframed race relations or the race
let's say topic
as I'll give you the quick view if you
want to find the video it's in my
Twitter feed and it's a quick little
micro lesson in which I compared the uh
the concepts of race that we're most
focusing on
from CRT to reparations to you know
grievances Etc and then compared that to
all the best practices in
self-development or success if you find
out that focusing on the racing frame
is in direct conflict with all the
things that are best practices for your
own best life
best example is that people who teach
success
tell you that you should have gratitude
about whatever is working out and that
gratitude will inspire you and lift you
to work harder for you know the future
so it turns out that gratitude about the
current situation at least
gives you extra energy for doing stuff
in the future
whereas I pointed out that if you're
studying slavery in the past and
discrimination of the past how can you
possibly have any gratitude for that
it's it's impossible
and so one of the main tools of success
is being removed from Black Americans
through a system that tells them they
should be focused on you know the
Grievances of the past which are real
and should not be forgotten and should
be taught
but it's it if everything stayed the way
it is Black America should fall behind
farther
does that make sense we've developed a
system where we're training black
Americans to do all the wrong things for
personal success focus on the past work
under your grievances get your
reparations don't don't do things for
other people they owe you why should you
do anything for them they owe you and
how about how about teaching black
people that being openly racist is fine
do you realize we did that
that not we but like the culture the
culture taught black Americans they can
be openly racist against white people
and anybody else and they get a free
pass
now I don't mind that they have feelings
but if you're doing it openly you're
working against your own success
strategy
you've probably seen on social media you
know there are way too many of them some
video that went viral of some black
American complaining about white people
now suppose the complaint is completely
accurate
that's not my point
my point is I would never hire that
person would you
it has nothing to do with anything
except having the wrong mindset for
success
I would definitely hire somebody who
said all the problems of the past are
exactly what they look like
that would be just be an accurate
objective view but if that's what you're
leading with like today
you're leading with your grievance if
your grievance is what you're tweeting
I don't want to work with you it has
nothing to do with your race it has to
do with being infected with a a loser
philosophy right the only people who win
with this backwards looking ESG CRT
stuff is the people who are signaling
their awesomeness you know hey I'm
signaling my awesomeness and the people
who make money selling those courses
that's it everybody else is just
 and nobody wants it
that's an exaggeration I'm sure there
are people who want it
so uh when I talked to Larry given that
he tweeted that video he must have at
least some
some compatible Thoughts with it we'll
find out how compatible
and
the good news is
maybe we could uh we can at least get
the message to some people
in Black America and everywhere else
then if you're working on your personal
success the tools of personal success
are very accessible right it doesn't
take uh you don't have to take a college
course
to learn that if you act more with more
gratitude you'll have better results
right that doesn't require college if I
tell you uh have a good positive like
optimistic frame of what is going to
happen you don't have to go to college
to understand that it's all just
available to everybody if I told you
that continuously adding talents to your
existing talents is absolutely going to
help you in life
do you need to be college educated to
understand that no everybody can learn
stuff everybody can understand that some
kinds of skills work well together to
make you more valuable right so the
thing that bugs me the most
is that the the basic
tools for Success everybody who
succeeded used the same tools and it's
not being taught to Black Americans and
instead they're they're being taught
anti-success
you know how to not be successful
it's not presented that way but it's
very cleanly and clearly a way to keep
them second class citizens
because they just won't be doing the
stuff that works and the stuff that
works is denied to them
by you know people who may I don't think
anybody intends it but that's always
worked out
Boomer somebody says how does that how
does that make sense
what does a boomer have to do in these
uh does Khan Academy deny them see the
thing with Khan Academy is that you
would have to know that's a good idea
you'd have to know it exists but there
are not many people who can self you
know learn on their own from a video
it's pretty hard to do
so as as much as I love Khan Academy I
feel it's better for people who already
have some kind of education and are
trying to fill in some spots or they're
trying to augment their their schooling
uh what's the incentive if the
government is giving you things well
does that question make sense
what's the incentive if the government
is giving you things
the government would give me things if I
were poor do you think that I would
prefer that over
success
who in the world prefers getting stuff
free from the government
versus being rich or being well off
you think some do
I think some do you know I mean it's a
big world so there's always somebody who
does anything but I've got a feeling
that that has more to do with knowing
what's possible
suppose you took you're just an average
person doesn't matter what ethnicity you
say this person here's the deal if you
don't work we'll give you some social
services you can live in squalor but you
won't have to work
at least you don't have to work
some people would take that
but if the alternative is look you can
live in squalor but here are some set of
tools and techniques that if you did
these things pretty much guaranteed to
get out of this squalor
now do you do it
now suppose I say to you if the
government will take care of you but you
have to live in squalor the alternative
is to try to make it the way white
people do I'm speaking the the worst
possible way and uh and it's not
available to you because of systemic
racism
yeah so you have a choice of the free
stuff and you don't have to work but you
live in squalor or you can work really
hard but the system is just so biased
against you it won't help you at all
right
so
I I get you know I agree with the point
that some people can't be helped
but I don't believe that's that
describes an entire class of people that
would be crazy
you know everything's about more of the
good stuff and less of the bad stuff
there are no absolutes but there's no
way in the world that Black America
would fall behind
if they use the tools for individual
success
it would be just a huge difference in
how everything is starting out
yeah
and like I said before if I sniff
if I meet a new person and I get even a
whiff
that they're living in the the racism
frame
you know where CRT and that stuff or
their main concern I wouldn't hire
anybody like that whether it doesn't
matter the race I wouldn't hire a white
person who said you know I only want to
work for a company that has ESG
I wouldn't hire a white person who said
that
because they're not focused on what I
want which is profitability now of
course I also want not to pollute I want
to you know not add any CO2 that I don't
have to and I want to have access to the
entire diverse Workforce
but I'm not going to hire somebody with
the wrong mindset so we're talking about
mindset not ethnicity
and if we started talking about mindset
everything would be fixed
right
do you do you think when I said my uh
hyperbole do you think I said I sure
would like to avoid contact with black
people who have a success mindset
can you imagine that I would ever think
that
no anybody who has a success mindset I
want to be your friends with that I want
to be your friend nothing else matters
nothing else matters I don't care you
know if you're
differently able different color
different gender I don't care about any
of that you come to me with a success
mindset
best friend
and the trouble is that we've we've
denied one group of Americans black
Americans
somehow the the common useful knowledge
that everybody else has and they've been
you know biased toward a a frame on life
that guarantees less success
guarantees less success
as as fence Peninsula says but I'm still
a jerk
did I ever deny that
did you ever say did you ever hear me
say well the one thing I want you to
believe is
my character is unassailable
I would never say that
I I'm pretty self-aware
um but you should be self-aware
that my um my public Persona does not
match my personal persona how many of
you knew that
I think the locals people know that but
on YouTube I'm just asking you how many
of you understand
that my public Persona is a sort of a
heightened
character
like my actual me
pretty different
now I'm not lying in public right so the
things I say are all the things I really
believe I think I can't think of any
exception but the things I say in public
are my actual beliefs it's just that I I
ramped them up a little bit to you know
get the entertainment value
and also to make a message and you know
and when people got mad that I insulted
a group of Americans and they asked me
to apologize
and I thought
no I insulted them to get their
attention
so that all of us would be better off
now the fact that 98 of all the people
watching my story don't believe that
yeah well that's what got me canceled
and I haven't complained about it yet I
don't expect to
so I feel like I'm right where I need to
be and right where I need to be is I'm
going to draw a line that says
for something this important the
complete destruction of black American
Minds
by teaching them anti-success tools
and ignoring the very available success
tools that make anybody successful of
any any type
that's too far
is too far
and if I have to like give up my career
to say like you're just destroying the
whole freaking country
that would be worth it
I I have to admit that my overall
feeling is that although I have not
penetrated the other bubble I'm going to
keep keep tapping on it
and you know I never give up so
if you don't know anything else about me
I never give up to my dying breath
I'm going to make this work one way or
another now I don't think I can change
the world but I think I can maybe create
a subset of people
who know that personal success tools are
their way out
and then maybe that idea can spread
other people will see it because but the
thing I can't influence is pure pure
influence
you somehow have to create some peers if
you can any kind of a foothold so that
then they can influence their peers but
short of that
until I get one million followers
um
how many neighbors have I nudged to be
rich well I live in a high-end
neighborhood now so they're all doing
fine
uh Elon does not seem anti-ccp enough
well he's got a business to run
yeah if if uh musk had no business in
China I think we could be confident in
his opinion would sound different
but at the moment he has he doesn't have
options
and I don't think it's the right move to
you know
put him out of business
so in the long run I would hope that
he's looking for Alternatives in the
short run it's just a tough situation to
be in
hang on like a bum and a balloon like a
bum with a baloney sandwich yeah
as your YouTube channel increased
um yeah something like that but you know
the the YouTube channel doesn't
it's not like a big money maker

yeah at the level that uh it earns money
a 30 chance doesn't have any impact on
my life just none
all right
