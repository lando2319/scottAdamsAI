comments and uh then we'll have a show
boy will it be
good hey what's
happening there we
[Music]
go good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cup or
mug or glass a tanker chel orstein a
canteen jugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine hit of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the d z
go it just gets better every time well
there's a lot of news so I'm going to
run right through it and we're going to
get to some fun economic analyses of the
two candidates in ways that you will
understand for the first time ever
economics is hard I will simplify it for
you well the FBI has rated several uh
homes of the the AIDS of Mayor Adams in
New York City according to blaze media
and we don't know why yet but if the FBI
is all over the mayor and all over the
top AIDS there's something coming
down and keep in mind that it's probably
Democrats investigating Democrats so
whatever it is it must be really bad I
wonder does anybody even have a guess
what that would be
about I have a
hypothesis that if the FBI wanted to
jail any May mayor in
America it would take about 10 minutes
of Investigation to find out that they'
done sketchy things
with taxpayers
money so why would they pick this
particular
one so my question is is this the one
mayor that they've got some dirt on or
is there something they don't like about
this mayor was he about to endorse Trump
I mean what's going on here there's
something that we don't
know on top of the something we don't
know about what the alleged crimes are
so this story has layers is what I'm
saying if the only thing you find out is
that there's a crime and somebody's
looking into it I feel like we're going
to be missing at least a layer or two
you know what I mean because I don't
think that they have a process of going
after crime because it's a
crime and I told you to watch the uh
there's a show on Netflix called Wyatt
her and the cowboy Wars it's based on
real real facts of the real Wyatt her
and a war with some cowboys and when you
learn that the country has always had a
crooked Department of Justice and always
had CR crooked politics and the News was
always fake it really blows your mind to
see that nothing changed since the
1800s well Poland has an anti-tank robot
so it's a robot that goes near a tank
and then blows
up I don't think tanks are going to be
too useful for very long and now that
we've got uh flying drones that look
like dragons with fire breathing fire
and uh now a robot that will blow up a
tank I'm guessing that the cost of the
robot that blows up the tank is much
less than the tank itself so that be the
end of
Tanks I saw Tim Cook on some interview
saying something that I was not aware of
completely and it goes like this you
think that the reason we do
Manufacturing in China is because the
cost of Labor is
low turns out that hasn't been true for
a long
time the I'm sure the cost of Labor is
lower than America but there would be
other countries where it's even far
lower so they don't go to China because
the the wages are
low because they could get lower wages
in a lot of places they go there because
the China have a massive uh educational
advantage in how to build a
factory because building a factory is
its special skill uh especially if
you're building an assembly line and
you're building the the Robotics and the
you know the manufacturing techniques
that go into the building it's not the
building
it's the manufacturing techniques so
apparently the whole uh skill of tooling
up a manufacturing site is something
that there's there are tons of Chinese
citizens who have been trained to do it
and in America you could put them all in
one room so there's a skill in building
manufacturing sites that we don't have
and we're in trouble how much difference
does it make oh I don't know let's let
let's ask lucky
farmer who uh is a young billionaire
type who's building a defense defense
business himself with more high-tech
defense stuff like drones and whatnot
but uh he says the United States says if
we were to get in a war we only have
three weeks of
ammunition after three weeks of war the
United States would have to say hey um I
got an idea would you guys like to
startop stop fighting because we're on a
weapons
yeah we well we have the weapons we just
don't have the the things that go in
them you know like rockets and you know
we don't have any missiles and Rockets
and bullets
left but you say to yourself well we
could make more
right
nope we don't have the manufacturing
capability to make more more
ammunition at all like it's not like you
can make the factory work harder there's
no Factory and if there is a factory it
depends on China for
parts no we can't make weapons if we
started a war we'd lose for sure unless
we went
Nuclear So basically the only weapons we
have that work are nuclear because
everything else we just run out of them
in three weeks oh
well um here's some good good news the
uh NOAA the National Organization of
atmospher Association of a-holes or
something I don't know but it's a group
that does the weather forec um the
climate
forecasting for the federal government
and they've ordered a new hundred
million high performance computer to
help them with their uh their
predictions H let me see if I understand
this
story their predictions are currently
perfect or perfect enough that you would
spend billions of dollars maybe
trillions uh to believe them and operate
under the assumption that you know the
climate's getting warmer and the CO2 is
causing it so if you know that and you
know it so certainly that the entire
American economy is based on
it why do they need a new
computer if they already know the
answer strange strange unexpected hard
to explain thing so everything is
correct
already but for $100 million we can make
it
correct although it's correct
already and what about those
elections um just today I saw probably
six to 10 stories about something about
election Integrity that somebody was
looking to tighten up to which I said to
myself what
why would you need to tighten up an
election in so many different ways when
it's already
perfectly safe and not rigged and we can
audit it from top to
bottom it it's almost like the people
who are the closest to it don't think
it's perfectly
secure huh I'm trying to reconcile why
we need a new computer for the
predictions about the climate that we
already know are right and we got to fix
fix a 100 different things in the
election that we already knew was not in
need of any correction H it's almost
like the news just makes stuff
up well what about that story about
those Venezuelan prisons that uh Trump
says they're emptying the prisons and
the prisoners are coming up here but the
regular news the fake news the regular
fake news says there's no evidence to
support that and he doesn't offer any
well well let me tell you the closest
thing we have to evidence like that in
2022 uh Breitbart had a story it
reported by Randy
Clark and it said there was a uh so this
is 2022 there there was a Department of
Homeland Security intelligence
report um that was received by the board
of
Patrol and the report is that Breitbart
Texas you know the Texas office of brart
got the look at it
so this would not be a public document
it would be a reporter for Breitbart
says they got to look at a
document and the report uh indicates
that the Venezuelan government um under
Maduro uh is purposely freeing
inmates so the report is that they would
talk to Venezuelans and they would find
out that they had in fact been in
Venezuelan jails and they seem to have
been really least now there's a part
missing the part that's missing is there
is no indication that Venezuela is
releasing prisoners for the purpose of
coming to the United States there seems
to be evidence according to One Source
now that's not enough for me if you're
saying that one source is enough you
haven't been paying attention too much
you should probably never take one
source so even though One
Source that doesn't have any credibility
problems that I'm aware
of uh it's just a good idea to have a
second source so it's a one- source
story and the one- source story doesn't
go to the second question whether the
Venezuelans are doing it intentionally
but does that
matter once again Trump is directionally
correct even if he's not technically
correct so he might not be technically
correct that they're intentional
emptying the prison prison so that those
people can come to America and get them
out of the country it might be correct
that they have some reason to reduce the
prison
population for whatever
reason um and that some of them went to
America so I would say that Trump is
correct enough in a trumpian you know
directionally true statement that there
are prisoners people who were in Jail
recently for pretty bad crimes did in
fact come to America how many well he's
probably exaggerating that
but how many would it
take before you were pretty worried
about it so there is more evidence that
the so-called Venezuelan G gangs
conquering territory is a real thing uh
we just don't know the details and the
extent of it but it does seem that
Venezuelan gangs are conquering
territory in the United States
here's a story that uh I don't know
what's the most outrageous story of the
day but in Great Britain in the UK
they're looking to uh since their
prisons appear to be
full uh and they're going to be jailing
a lot more people because of their new
anti-free speech laws they're looking to
maybe um rent space in Estonian jails
which have lots of space so the Estonian
in jails are just plenty of space
they're not
full and they've decided that they'll
ship some of their prisoners there maybe
I think that's unconfirmed but one of
the plans is they might ship their
prisoners to
Estonia now what's wrong with that
story let me tell you what's wrong with
that
story if you heard that estonia's
prisons have lots of
room what's the best way to play this
what's your first thought whoa Estonian
prisons have plenty of room we could put
our prisoners in the Estonian prison
okay that's the way the UK is going now
I don't know if they'll do it but
they're definitely considering it here's
how I would have played it hey Scott did
you know that the Estonian prisons are
largely empty Watch How I play
this
why why
what why are the Estonian prisons large
empty did they did they overbuild their
prisons no
no but why are some of them empty does
their Department of Justice not work no
it works pretty well yeah no they have a
pretty good
system so what are they doing that is
not producing
criminals because you should be asking
more questions about
that so the question you should not be
asking Estonia is can we use your prison
space no you should ask what did you do
right that you don't have to put your
citizens in prison what did you do right
because do you know what the answer is
do you know what the estonians do
right almost
everything Estonia is this this this
weird little country that just got to be
sort of a special case in the world
where for whatever reason their
leadership are
rational I know you didn't see that
coming did you you could vote by an
app you just open your app and you can
vote Estonia is one of the you know best
internets pretty low
crime Estonia is killing it the only
problem Estonia has is they don't want
Russia to conquer him which is always a
risk but no let's ask why they don't
have people in the jail let's ask if we
can use their jail space that is the
loser
approach all right now the story about
that uh school shooter that the father
bought him the rifle for Christmas after
he had been already talked to uh by the
FBI for threatening a school
shooting so it looks like the father
might be in some legal trouble for
buying a deadly weapon for somebody who
had been interviewed by the
FBI as a potential school
shooter
[Music]
so well I mean everything about this
story just screams what is wrong with
this country at the
moment Well author Gad sad writing in
Newsweek uh saying that K Harris and her
campaign are hoping you turn your brain
off and use your emotions to pick your
candidate because keris doesn't have as
many you know detailed plans so the
thinking is that they have to sell sort
of the vibe or the feeling and and Gad
gives some examples of that and uh he's
arguing that uh you know we should maybe
use our sense of
reason and uh not be taken in by the
emotional appeal to which I say Gad you
are halfway
there he's halfway there so he
understands that the other side is not
being reasonable that's halfway there
until you understand that no voters make
make decisions based on reason you're
just going to be confused and annoyed by
everything you see because it won't make
sense now nobody uses reasons to
vote it is true that some ideas are
better than other ideas and people will
mention those things and talk about them
but it's not why they
vote why they vote is some mix of how
somebody makes them feel their Charisma
whether they're the same you know race
as you whether you just feel safe it's
just the irrational stuff and then we
rationalize it after the fact so why'
you vote for him or her well I like that
tax policy no that's not why you
voted it just isn't we we all have
reasons including me I'll give you a
reason for why I voted but I'm also
aware that I would have voted that way
if I had to make up different reason re
so whatever it is that drives any of our
decisions is always
irrational once you realize that
everything makes
sense well you know that story about
tenet media allegedly taking money from
Russia and hiding it and hiring some
conservative commentators to be under
their Banner on at least uh just on the
uh YouTube site
and um part of that is story is that
expanded into everybody accusing
everybody of being a foreign
agent so I I jokingly said yesterday on
X I was feeling bad because nobody had
put me on a list of potential foreign
influences and no no sooner had I done
that than I hear that there's a spaces
going on talking about me being a uh an
Israeli asset or something and I
thinking to myself
well that didn't take
long that didn't take long at all by the
way I'm not a re I'm not an Israeli
asset um I don't even support their
government you know they're on their own
I just observe simply
observing and
uh
so some people
say uh what was Putin up to you know why
would why would Russia try to you know
fund these people if it looks like there
was no effort to change them um
editorially so there doesn't seem to be
any evidence whatsoever that Tim P or uh
Benny Johnson um or uh or Dave Rubin
changed any of their opinions because of
where their funding came from there's no
evidence of that and I doubt it
happened um but Lauren Chen one of the
owners with her husband I guess of
tenant media
there people are reporting that she
seemed to be creating some division
among the conservative world but I would
note that there tends to be at the
moment a huge amount of division in the
Pro Trump side of the world more than
I've ever seen maybe probably more than
I've ever seen and you have to ask
yourself did that happen on its
own and then Putin was asked who he
prefers in the American election
um well let me give you some work up to
this I saw a post yesterday from J black
who's just apparently a
Democrat and uh he uses this technique
on his post you've seen it before where
somebody really wants to emphasize how
dumb you are they'll put their sentence
with a period after each
word you know what I mean so if I said
you period are period not period well
period
informed like Not only would I be making
a statement but I'd really be calling
you an idiot with all the periods it's
like you are so dumb I have to speak
slowly so J black did that um he wanted
me to know how dumb I am and maybe some
of you so he said and I'll quote I'll
say this slowly so Maga can understand
it if period r period want period your
period candidate period to period b
period elected period Then he period
shouldn't period be elected
period so the idea is that you know if
Trump is supported by
Putin that should be enough I mean that
should be enough by itself to tell you
not to vote for Trump because of all
that Putin support I mean that's obvious
isn't it I mean how much more obvious
Could It Be I'm going to say it with
periods it's period obvious
period Well a few hours after Jay said
that Putin endorsed
Harris
so uh several million people danced on
the uh the living grave of J black for
being the most obnoxious wrong person on
the
internet let me give you this advice
we're all wrong
sometimes and we're all a little
arrogant sometimes don't combine them
don't be arrogant and exactly terribly
wrong you can do one or the other and
probably get away with it just don't
combine them don't combine them Jay
anyway so um so that happened I saw
Jessica tarlo on the five say that the
the influencers like Tim Po were getting
$400,000 per month from
Russia now I have not looked into it but
I'm going to bet a very large amount of
money that they did not get paid
$400,000 a month a
piece does anybody want to take the
other side of that
bet I hate watching the news and
thinking okay I don't even have to
research that to know that's not true no
it's not true that any paid them
$400,000 a month and especially and not
asking them to change their opinions
whatsoever which appears to be the
case no I don't think so all
anyway
um so conservatives are divided and I
think there's lots of forces from the
outside that are doing that but I don't
know if it's all Russia or just happens
on its
own um I find figured out with a little
help why is the polls that should all
look the same let's say presidential
polls uh if they're all done
scientifically and appropriately they
should all be pretty similar but
sometimes they're not and here's one
reason why
not so the pollsters can determine how
to wait their results so for example
they can ask a bunch of people and they
could you know find out that they had
accidentally talked to too many people
in one party and they could either just
report it say well you know we had too
many people in one party but here's what
we got well that wouldn't really tell
you anything because you expect the
people in one party to vote one way
predictably so if you were to take that
approach that would suggest you were not
interested in a real answer but rather
were interested in influencing what
people thought about the situation so
that'd be the opposite of a poll it
would be persuasion another way you
could await them is by the percentage of
people who voted in the most recent
election so you could say well in
2020 the total votes were this
percentage Democrat and that percentage
Republican so you could use that and
that wouldn't be a bad assumption would
it that there would be roughly the same
mix as there was in the most recent
election wouldn't change that much in a
few years so that's a reasonable way
here's a but here's another way you
could do it you could wait it by um
likely
voters so you could balance it by the
correct number of Democrats to
Republicans to
Independents but then you've got a
problem because The Independents are not
really Independents are they so couldn't
you accidentally have gotten a whole
bunch of Independents who really are
just Democrats they just don't like to
say they're Democrats so you wouldn't
necessarily know that would you you
wouldn't know if you accidentally talk
to too many Democrats they just happen
to call themselves uh Independents
because half the country is calling
themselves
Independence so that's the problem
um so you can wait it by likely
voters you can do it by 2020 mix or you
could not wait them at all how different
do you think those answers would be
pretty different yeah quite different so
here's my
question are these polls telling you
what is or is their selection of what
assumptions they make really the whole
poll was there any even was there any
reason to even talk to the public
because once you made an assumption
about you know what you're waiting would
be you kind of already knew how it was
going to come out by the
Assumption so as a person who used to
collect information for corporate bosses
for many years that was my job let me
tell you it's always the assumptions
that determine the result the public
believes it's the data
nope if it were the data everybody would
get the same answer and if they didn't
they would know why pretty quickly it's
like oh you you wrote that data down
wrong look here's the real data you got
that wrong no it's the assumptions it's
the same thing with climate change
polling and climate change have the same
problem the person who makes the
assumptions decides what the outcome
will be it's not the
data all
right Jordan Peterson is predicting that
uh Biden is going to quit in a few weeks
uh so that we can have quote Vice
president kacen kamla as the first US
Dei Barbie president
wellow Jordan Peterson don't hold back
tell us tell us what you're really
feeling here I feel like you're you're
just holding back too much well I would
add to that what others have added to it
I think by now that maybe the reason
Hunter decided to wrap up his uh
situation and plead guilty without
saying he's actually guilty in that
weird legal away that uh maybe he just
wants to wrap things up so his he'll his
father will have time to Pardon him
before he leaves from office and I think
that is a reasonably good
prediction um I don't think it's
100% but if I had to make a small bet on
it I would bet that he will quit in time
to give c hereis a boost for having
already been the first black woman
president
so we might get one of
those kind of through the back
door um Biden was giving a little uh
rally speech in favor of uh of Harris
and he he said out loud that the
inflation reduction Act was really just
a fake and it was really the green New
Deal Bill basically and it didn't wasn't
really to reduce any
inflation so uh how long do we wait
between the time that you know the
Democrats make claims that the news
supports to the to the point where the
Democrats themselves can just say well
you know actually we made all that up it
wasn't wasn't even about inflation
reduction now it's not that we didn't
figure it out but when I say we I mean
the people who really paid attention to
the news but the average voter probably
thought hey look at that them reducing
inflation good job
Biden um I saw Peter St an he's on he's
on X um he's got some videos on various
topics
PhD and he was noting that uh weak men
and single women tend to vote uh left
and not just because of
abortion but because they do it in other
countries as well no matter what the
abortion laws are so we men and single
women tend to vote Democratic here and
left in other countries why is that well
it seems to be
evolutionary and it seems to go like
this if you feel personally
weak then you're worried about what's in
your immediate
environment does that make sense that
makes sense right if you feel personally
vulnerable you barely can walk outside
because your environment is dangerous so
the first thing that you'd want to
fix is your environment when you walk
outside so you'd want to make sure
nobody had guns and you'd want to make
sure all the poor people got fed so they
don't need to rob you and you would make
a bunch of assumptions that might lean
yeah lean left um if you are Republican
and you're either a strong man or a
married woman who would feel like she
has some protection you would say I
don't need the government to protect me
like on my own property because I'm
married and you know I got a strong
husband I've got the protection but I am
worried about the
country so Republicans and strong men
and married women tend to be more
concerned about people coming across the
border and women seem to be more
concerned about you know what's in their
immediate environment in terms of what
what they should be afraid
of so that feels to me like there's
something to it I don't know if they got
exactly the right genetic explanation
but I do feel it can't be a coincidence
that people who feel weak and
unprotected are looking for the
government to immediately give them some
protection makes
sense um we got some new economic
reports I'm seeing them described in
different ways
uh Julia Pollock said uh the jobs report
is very much in line with
expectations um it's all boring it's you
everything's sort of in the general area
that we thought it would be a little bit
more a little bit less um I think there
was another job report that got the July
job report I think got uh revised down
again of
course anyway there's uh I think I would
describe the report as somewhat anemic
um so somewhat expected but anemic which
means that we'll probably get a rate cut
which would be good for the stock
market but don't make any Investments
because of me I'm not really good at
investment
advice um how many of you have heard of
a historian who predicts the the outcome
of elections in the United States and
he's been right pretty much every time
his name is Alan lickman and he's got
this 13o uh true or false questions that
will tell you who's going to get elected
and he says right now that ad and a 13
go in favor of
Harris so that his thing which has never
been
wrong um is saying there's a strong
signal for Harris to get elected do you
believe it he's got 13 questions it's
been right every
time eight and a 13 go for Harris so
she'll get
elected do you have any questions about
that maybe the questions would be what
are those 13
questions have you ever heard the 13
questions and if I told you the 13
questions do you think you would still
be confident that this is a good
prediction
method let's find
out all
right so here are the things that would
be positive for the uh let's call it the
incumbent let's call it comma the
incumbent um if the White House Party
gains seats in the House in the midterm
all right so that that didn't happen so
that would be negative to um the White
House Party in in office um the
incumbent president is
running well I would say that's not the
case it was when it was Biden but it's
not the case now so that so that would
be two that I would score against them I
believe Ellen lickman scored this for
Harris because she would be like the
incumbent I say she's not the incumbent
you the polls changed immediately as
soon as she got in her mix of people who
supported her changed her policies she
says they going to be
different so I don't think she's the
incumbent and beyond that I think that
Trump was a little bit of an incumbent
once too
so I don't think this one applies and if
it does apply it leans in my opinion
toward Trump next one is the White House
Party avoided a
primary so the reason behind this is if
they avoided a primary it's because
their candidate was so
strong did the Democrats avoid a primary
yes was it because their candidate is so
strong
no no they they GED the system so you
can't give this one to Harris and say
she was so strong we well we didn't even
need a primary really no that didn't
happen she went in despite being weak so
this one doesn't
count uh how about a third c a third
party candidate is
running so that would be usually good
for who the who was in the white house
except the only Third Party candidate
with any any weight just decided to join
the Trump team
so how do you weigh this do you say RFK
Jr counts as a benefit for Harris when
he joined the Trump team no this one is
completely irrelevant in our in this
weird situation how about the short-term
economy is
strong is
it it depends who you ask in my opinion
is weak but I know that other people
Democrats would say oh it's pretty
strong right now no it's completely weak
if you talk to people they'll say
everything costs too much and it's not
easy to get a
job that sounds weak things are too
expensive and you can't get a
job so that one looks like it goes for
it Trump's way how about the growth of
the long-term economy has been as strong
as the last two
terms well again this is a weird one
because the pandemic but it doesn't look
like our growth is impressive so I don't
think that works in their
favor um if the White House has enacted
major national policy changes that would
go in favor of the White House but
shouldn't you say that the major
national policy changes are popular
because we have a national policy change
on Ukraine that were balls to the wall
and it's
unpopular we have uh you know support
for Israel that's pretty
mixed so and then there's that
infrastructure thing that nobody's seen
anything happen
from so I don't really think there's
anything positive that was a major
national policy change so that doesn't
seem to apply how about there's no
social
unrest oh I don't know what do you call
January 6ers being locked up and you
know complete division in the country
and some people are asking for
reparations and some people are looking
for a new country to move to I would say
there's plenty of social unrest but it's
not on the streets because Republicans
get hunted so they can't be on the
streets so that seems not applicable uh
there is no scandal in the white
house what are you talking
about the the whole Ukraine Hunter Biden
uh you know uh and the whole cover up
the whole cover up of Biden's cognitive
ability these are gigantic scandals
gigantic scandals and I think I think
the historian sort of discounted it how
about uh the incumbent Party candidate
has
Charisma well to his credit the
historian did say that Trump has the
Charisma and kamla is not the charisma
candidate so that that one he gave to
Trump uh how about the Challenger is
uncharismatic no again that one goes to
Trump because he's
charismatic how about the White House
had foreign policy
success what was the White House's
foreign policy success opening the
Border war in Ukraine or not helping
Israel
enough I don't see any big foreign
policy success or how about leaving
Afghanistan how about uh the White House
had foreign policy failure well I think
they got some failures here's how I read
this there are 13 indicators in favor of
trump or they're
inapplicable they're either inapplicable
or they favor Trump now do you remember
what I told you about data versus
assumptions the data is in favor of KL
Harris 8 and of 13 but how did you you
get the data it's all based on
assumptions and the assumptions are
whack they're I I mean they're not any
worse than any other voter's assumptions
but it's just one person's
assumptions and and I look at it I go
well I'm one person I pay attention I
look at the
news I don't see any of these as being
the right assumptions they all look like
the wrong assumptions to me
so how could it be that I have so many
questions about this and yet it
accurately predicted who would win the
White House a whole bunch of times in a
row how do you explain that well I have
a
hypothesis do you remember when James
Carville told the Clinton campaign uh
the Bill Clinton campaign it's the
economy
stupid he said basically just ignore
everything else people are going to vote
on the economy and then it was true that
was the most important part well one of
his 13 things is that the short-term
economy looks
good it could be that the person who
wins is the one who has the best
argument about the economy and that's
the whole game it might be that you
didn't need 13 you just needed one and
you didn't need the historian you need
just needed James Carville to say it's
it's the economy stupid well well well
but about the the social unrisked
Scandal of the Charisma well no it's
it's the economy stupid well what about
the who had a primary contest third
about what about a third party candidate
running what what about the no it's it's
it's the economy stupid it's the economy
stupid so I'm going to take Carville
over the
historian uh KL Harris said out loud
yesterday that she will sign a
reparation bill this fills me with deep
hatred deep hatred there are other
things that I say oh that would be a
problem um you know this might not work
out for me you know I don't like higher
taxes for example but this one fills me
with
hate I just hate her
guts and I hate anybody who would be in
favor of this why because your problems
are not magic and
special it is there is there any Legacy
of slavery that is impacted current
black Americans yes absolutely systemic
racism completely
real but I don't care because I've got
problems too everybody I know has
problems some have health problems some
were abused as children some had parents
who were addicts some uh just were in
the wrong place at the wrong time some
were born in bad parts of the
world your problems are not special and
magical they're real they're real and if
you want to say the government caused it
I'd say sure I just don't care and that
is not an argument that I need to
 pay for
it you you can make your little uh you
know academic argument that connects all
the dots and I can look at it in a piece
of paper and I'll say yes I get that
that dot yep that does connect those
dots are all connected you've made your
point but I don't care and there's no
reason I should care because nobody has
magic special problems we all
got
problems I would take having the legacy
of slavery if the tradeoff was that I
got free college and I was 6'4 and look
good you know handsome healthy 6 fo4
free college I'll take that thank you
very much yeah I'll take
that and we don't see a lot of people uh
pretending to be uh White to get into
college do we no we don't and do you
think that the asian-americans should be
paying some reparations when the
only impact that black people have had
on their lives since you know they came
in after slavery was a done deal the
only impact had on their lives is that
they got fewer jobs and they were
victims of crime and now they're going
to pay the black black Americans for
something they had no connection to and
indeed it should be paid the other
direction
no no this is dumb
divisive terrible
illogical evil and I hate you if
you're looking at this as a reason to
take my money that I worked for under a
system that I was told that if I did all
the right things I'd get to keep my
money and now Harris is making it very
clear that if I do all the right things
I still have to give the money to people
who
didn't now there are other reasons
people don't succeed but I'm not buying
into this at all no you cannot make me
think that one group of people had
special magical problems and therefore I
have to give them my money nope there's
no argument that connects that
dot 88 corporate leaders just back to KL
Harris including James Murdoch the
former CEO of 21st Century Fox and an
heir to the Murdoch family media Empire
H so that would mean that everybody on
the left leaning side of the news is in
favor of KL Harris but also the the
primary major entity that would be
potentially on the other side is in
favor of KL
Harris at least in terms of ownership of
the Fox network there would be plenty of
individual opinions that will vary of
course that's not good now here's the
question if you were a stockholder of
any of these 88
corporations would you be happy that
they just uh volunteered you to make
less money because they decided to back
the one who's going to tax them the
most you
idiots yeah here here's my
advice for company
leaders you got two choices that don't
make you look like the biggest ath yet
in the world one stay completely out of
it I would use as my example Jeff
Bezos I imagine Jeff Bezos has strong
opinions about things political
I'm quite impressed at the degree to
which he's managed to stay out of it now
of course Amazon like every company is
going to have some wokeness and Dei and
stuff it's somewh unavoidable in the
corporate world at the moment but I'm
not even sure I could tell you what Jeff
bezos's personal opinion is and
Zuckerberg also told you he was going to
stay out of
it this time what do I think about those
two leaders excellent I only need you to
make money so my stocks go up and the
country does well and your employees get
paid and then they can buy things from
me that's all I need I don't need you
advocating for you to play pay more
taxes I don't need the fiduciary leader
of the thing I invested in to be saying
in public you know I'd like to give some
of my money away um not for any
particular reason it's just uh I don't
know I just thought I should back this
candidate was going to take more of my
money and therefore your money I can't
even believe that these idiots would
sign up for the we're going to back the
one who wants to take more of our money
now I
get that you know the argument is more
than just
taxes but if you're the CEO of a
publicly traded
company I feel like you should pay
attention to the taxes and maybe not the
other issues that would be my advice
otherwise you were in the wrong jobs my
friends you should all be you should all
be removed honestly the boards of each
of these companies should remove
them uh imagine that you were a leader
of one of these 88 countries companies
and you just endorsed haris and you
didn't need to it was optional you could
have just said we're staying out of
it don't you think that that
automatically cost them business because
the Republicans would say all right if I
have a choice
I will no longer buy from your company
because I wanted you just to make money
but now you're if I give you money
you're going to be using it to destroy
the country as I see
it so if I were the board I would remove
all 88 of them and I would do it right
away I mean I wouldn't even wait till
the end of the day I would say look you
are absolutely free to endorse anybody
you want as long as you're not working
here because if you're working here
you're just crushing our our Revenue
potential Forever by the way bud light
is not catching up so yeah that's uh 88
boards that should be meeting today and
should be removing every one of these
people I just don't think people in
corporations should be
backing backing any candidate now I'm
here this is going to sound
inconsistent but if they'd backed the
candidate who wanted to lower their
taxes I would back off because I would
say okay that that does feel like you're
getting into politics but not really
because you're really into just lowering
your own taxes and that's your job
you're supposed to be trying to lower
your taxes so if so if a if a CEO or CFO
says we like the one who's going to
lower our taxes fine that's like not
even political that's just your
taxes I I wouldn't even think about not
shopping there for that
reason maybe Democrats would but I I
doubt that
too according to Zero Hedge this uh the
jobs that people are getting are mostly
going to foreign born workers so the
foreign born workers were up 635,000 in
jobs in August while native born were
down 1.3
million now you're going to say to
yourself that's
terrible because the foreign born people
are getting all the jobs but I would
hedge it this way
why did they get the
jobs remember it's foreign born it's not
just undocumented we're not talking
about the people who walked across the
border with the clothes on their back
foreign
born quite often means that you're a
technical expert or a doctor or a
scientist and you came to America
because it's a better opportunity well
of course they're
employed because they're here because
they have those skills that are in high
demand so without knowing if the quote
foreign born workers are mostly people
who walked across the border with
nothing including an education and
English ability or people who were
fluent in two or three languages and had
a skill stack like you can't believe and
they would just rather work in America
to which I say come on in more the
better so it's not really clear that
they're taking American jobs it might
have been there weren't Americans for
those jobs we don't know so I say that
could be good and it could be bad and we
can't tell well Trump trump was asked
about child care at an event I think the
other day and some say his answer was
incoherent um I would agree with that I
think he's got some idea like you know
using uh tariffs to pay for it or
something I don't know but it doesn't
sound like a real plan so I'm I'm not
going to you and say oh he's
got the good plan I don't think I don't
think he's got a plan um but here's my
way I would approach
it I would approach healthc care the way
I would approach a number of other
topics like transportation for example
insurance if you were to design a city
from
scratch with the understanding that only
the federal government would have any
regulatory or law authority over it you
this would be similar to Trump's idea of
using federal land to build some cities
if you built a city from scratch one of
the things you could do is you could
design away the cost of child care now
I'm going to give you the bad version of
how to do that just so you could kind of
understand it conceptually but don't
don't argue too much about the details
I'm just trying to sell you on the idea
that you could design away a lot of
expense right so suppose you had a new
community and a facility that is owned
by the public in which uh you could drop
off your kid or your pet you could drop
your dog
off and there would be somebody there to
watch it but they'd be mostly
volunteers so if you're lonely and
retired or unemployed at the moment or
you're single and it's your day off and
you just want to be around people in a
productive way you could go there and
you could help out or you could just
work out on some gym equipment that's
there but maybe they want to you know
keep the males away from the kids but
you'd have video everywhere there would
be no dark Corners no closets that
anybody could go into no matter what so
that if anybody tried anything that was
inappropriate with a child it would be
like any public space if you saw
somebody doing something inappropriate
with a child in let's say a restaurant
you would immediately intervene so it
doesn't happen there so if you create a
situation where there are a few paid
employees and somebody at the door to
make sure that nobody gets in unless
they're they're vetted somehow you could
create a situation where there's just a
natural collection of people who are
meeting each other sometimes bonding
even and they could create a social life
they could get some oxytocin they'd have
purpose they'd have a place to go they'd
have a schedule things that people are
really really going to need especially
as the robots start taking our
productive work so you may say to
yourself but Scott I have this or that
complaint about that situation to which
I say don't worry about the details the
only point is we're not organized in a
way that we could lower that cost but we
could it seems very doable now let's
take
rent how can you lower the cost of rent
well one way would be there are a lot of
seniors who have extra rooms empty nests
spouses died and there should be far
more of a effort to get them a college
age roommate who can't pay for rent but
they might be able to help out with some
chores and you know if you fall down and
die they'll call the
911 so there's just a whole bunch of
ways you could organize that would take
away expenses what about the expense of
Transportation well if you design your
city so that you get the self-driving
taxes if you need them but mostly you
can walk everywhere you want if you had
bicycle paths from every house to every
school you could completely eliminate
driving kids to school and buses they
could just take their electric
skateboard or bicycle and just park it
at the school and come back right so you
can think of a hundred different ways
that you could just drive the cost of
living down to practically nothing and
your quality of living would be through
the roof I always use my college
experience as my example my college
experience was the on paper the worst
living condition I was in this you know
tiny little room with a roommate for the
first couple
years and you know had to share a
bathroom and you know there's no kitchen
there you got to walk through the snow
to get food on paper it's the worst
place but because it was designed to
give me everything I needed and it
surrounded me with people I wanted to
associate with it was the best
experience I've ever had there's nothing
in my life that will ever come close to
that but I think we could do that for
adults I think you create a situation
where you just met a bunch of awesome
people without any effort at all because
they were just there and you were doing
something in
common all right so I think there's
nobody's got a good plan for child care
uh let's talk about the Trump economic
plan um I asked Gro to summarize it so
it may have missed a few things but so
he wants to reduce the corporate tax
rate from 21 to
15% keris wants to raise
it um but Trump also wants to put a uh
tariff a lot of uh stuff coming into the
country now how many of you think you
understand tariffs how many of you think
an economist can tell you if a tariff is
a good idea or a bad idea how many of
you think that it sort of depends you
know you could see it could be a good
idea in some cases bad in others but
that we could do the math and we could
know that how many think you can know
it well here's what you need to know
there are two reasons for a
tariff the good reason for a tariff is
that there's some country that's trying
to destroy an entire industry in your
country so because the country is behind
it not just the company selling Goods
the country is behind it like China they
could uh subsidize the
product until nobody would ever buy an
American car because they seem too
expensive so we'd all have Chinese cars
and then we would have no car industry
and then China would slowly start
raising the prices because it's the only
place you can buy a car from China so in
that case tariffs are not about what you
paid extra for the car although it might
end up in your price for your car what
it is is a way to keep your entire
industry from being
destroyed now when they when people talk
about uh tariffs what is the dumbass
thing they say I'm I'm going to do it
with a a stupid
face so that the next time you hear it
you can remember my stupid face it goes
like this a tariff a tariff is a tax on
the consumer a tariff is a tax on the
consumer is
it what do you think is it tax on the
consumer it can be in the sense that uh
if you raise the if you raise the cost
on a foreign
producer they might say well you're
still going to have to buy it because
you can't get it anywhere else so I
guess we'll just raise the
price so it depends whether you had a
choice so let me give you an example if
China was trying to sell table salt in
the United States at 10% of what
Americans make table salt for if America
makes it I don't know just making this
up then we should we should put a tariff
on them but would you pay more for
salt no you wouldn't no because the
Tariff would take the foreign price up
to about the domestic price or maybe
higher if it's higher than the domestic
price you just say oh well just buy them
B and salt like I always did there's no
difference in your price now you do lose
the opportunity to get the lower price
but there's nothing to be passed on to
you you're simply not buying Chinese
salt because why would you same price as
the Morton salt and it's Chinese and
well you might as well give it to
America now let's say it's a different
situation it's not something like salt
that you can get anywhere let's say it's
a specific component or
material that if you didn't get it from
China you could couldn't even build the
thing you want to build with their
material well in that case if you put a
tariff on it you're just paying for it
yeah because they're going to say all
right where else are you going to get
this and you'd say uh okay good point
there's literally nowhere else I can get
it so how about you pay whatever we
charge
you I guess I have to
so the first thing you need to know is
that it completely depends on what
product of this if if you if you're
saying in general it's good or in
general it's bad well you're just stupid
all right it's not in general good or in
general bad it depends entirely upon the
specific thing that's being tariffed so
so remember this the first thing you
need to know is it depends if you had
options if you have plenty of options
then your price doesn't go up at all
it's just that that company doesn't do
business in the United States it's too
expensive if you have to buy it then the
government shouldn't put the Tariff on
it does that make sense if we do it
right there wouldn't be any tariff on
something that you had to buy so there'
be no cost to pass
on did you already understand that how
many of you already understood that
before I explained it because tariffs
are kind of wonky and confusing and then
you get to the um a tariff to defend an
industry here's what they never
calculate when the people tell you SC so
they'll just pass along the price it's
just like a tax on the consumer it's
just going to pass along the
price did they calculate what it cost
the United States to get rid of the car
industry because that's kind of big if
you lose the entire automobile
industry and the only way you could have
kept it was was some tariffs did they
include the cost of losing the entire
automobile industry and all that pay and
all the things that those people would
have bought and they might have bought
more things from you whatever it is that
you're selling no they don't no they
don't and that cost is enormous and they
just sort of act like that's not part of
the question no losing an entire
industry is the question it's not the oh
there was a little tax it was the Tariff
was a little tax that got passed on to
the consumer no that's the dumb view
right the sophisticated view is you're
protecting an entire industry in some
cases because the value of the industry
is critical to America in that case even
if you paid a little more it'd be worth
it so if you put a if you put it on
something that you have to get it's a
bad idea if you put it on something that
you could get at the same price from
America it's a great idea if you put a
tariff on something that would destroy
an entire industry in America if you
don't do it it's a great idea so on
balance are tariffs good ideas or bad
ideas well in the political realm we
deal with tariffs the way we deal with
people stupidly so let let me give you
an
example um there was a Democrat once who
did some bad things and therefore all
Democrats are
bad that's how we look at
Teri that uh well there's one situation
I could think of where a tariff would be
bad which would be a tariff on a good
that we couldn't get anywhere else and
so the prices passed on to us yeah don't
do that one don't do that
one this is not hard you just don't do
that
one so I'm in favor of tariffs because a
country has to have them to protect
itself from uh protect its important
industries all right
um let's see what
else um Trump wants to do an emergency
declaration
to drastically increase nuclear energy
production so he would get rid of some
regulations and be faster about
approving new things Etc but also
approving new drilling so he'd be a
emergency declaration to get the
government organized and just very
quickly getting our energy production up
that is exactly right that is 100%
economically logically
geopolitically correct all good so he
wants to eliminate 10 redu 10
regulations for every new one he wants
to get Elon Musk working on efficiency
of the government that could be amazing
just copy Estonia and
um let's see uh Sovereign wealth fund so
Trump wants to use the tariffs he wants
to use the money he gets from the
tariffs to create a sovereign wealth
fund now what that is is a fund that's
managed by a country so that's the
Sovereign part so other countries have
these um and uh it could be used for
infrastructure and other national
projects okay I mean it would depend
what the other projects are I guess but
in concept that sounds okay um Trump
wants to Spur the economic growth of
course and close the make the borders
secure and lower the crime and he wants
to put a bunch into to
R&D uh offering 100% bonus depreciation
for new manufacturing investment right
so these are good things now by the way
Harris has some good things too so it's
it's not all good things compared to bad
things they both got some
things um but here's my problem with
analyzing economic plans if part of your
plan is growth and part of your plan is
uh tax
changes which of those two things can
somebody measure easily well maybe not
easily but if you're an analyst you
could look at the change in taxes and
you could make some assumptions about
revenue and then you could say Okay
Trump's plan will do this to the deficit
and KL Harris's will do this to the
deficit do you think somebody did that
yes they
did I'm not going to name names but if
you see somebody say the Trump plan will
uh uh increase the deficit by $4
trillion or something and the Harris
plan will increase the deficit by 1
point something trillion are we done oh
no one of them increases the debt more
than the other so we're done right you
don't want the one that increases the
debt or do you here's something I
learned in Corporate
America you only manage to the things
you can measure you can measure
predict what the tax income will be if
you just make assumptions that
everything else will be the same if
everything else is the same and the only
thing you did is change the taxes you
could kind of calculate what the tax uh
gains would be but here's what you can't
calculate the offsetting benefit is the
growth so if you cut your taxes more
aggressively to get more growth where's
that they don't even calculate it so if
you see somebody say that Trump would
add to the deficit more than KLA Harris
they're only looking at half of the
equation they're just looking at a
direct tax cut how much would you
collect but that's not the game the game
is that the taxes should be modified to
get you the optimum growth number so if
you're not looking at the total benefits
of the growth over time you know looking
at like a 10year uh period Then you
haven't even you haven't even done the
math yet if the only thing you're
looking at is the direct tax change
you're looking at a publication that's
either selling you
propaganda or they don't know how to do
their
job because the growth part's the
important part you just leave that
out Trump isn't saying cut your taxes
just to make them less he's saying cut
them so you spur the economy in all
these variety of ways you got to measure
the spurred economy now if you say it
won't move at all I mean I'd have to
hear that argument but if if you think
it wouldn't change the economy at all I
mean that's hard to believe but if you
believe that I I suppose you should
state
that all right Harris has a plan of uh
some kind of price gouging control on
food and maybe meds and of course um
nobody thinks that the price gouging
thing is a good idea uh now I well
let me modify that if there's real price
gouging then I think we'd all be in
favor of doing something about it but I
don't think they're going to find
evidence that in the food business you
might find that there was a little bit
during the pandemic but I think I think
the uh free market keeps their margins
to a relatively uh reasonable level she
wants to do stuff for housing giving
$225,000 and down payment assistance and
blah blah for started homes that might
be good
again there's a tendency to just look
what it costs and not a tendency to look
at the economic benefit of
it um she wants to put a cap on insulin
prices that's probably not too different
than what Trump was doing Child Care
credits she wants to improve those so it
makes it look like she wants to do more
for um child care I mean at the very
least she'd increase the tax credits um
tax
policies increase the corporate tax to
28 from 21 that would make your stock
market Fall in value which make you feel
less wealthy which would make you spend
less so you got to calculate that which
they don't of
course um then some kind of a tax
deduction for startup businesses so
they'd get a
$50,000 right off as long as they made
money
eventually um
I like it in concept I don't know if
there if a lot of people would change
their behavior because of it but you
know my My Philosophy is if you need to
solve a problem and we do you know how
to grow faster um if you've got an idea
that could work well let's try it you
know the downside isn't you know death
so maybe this would make a difference
uh so I'd be willing to try it you know
it wouldn't matter who suggested it if
it doesn't work pull it
back you know you'll know in a year is
it worth a year of this probably it
might be worth a year there's going to
be you know cheating and graft and all
that stuff corruption but you'll know in
a
year
um and then she's then Harris has to
figure out how to be different from
Biden I guess that's important all right
ladies and
gentlemen the most important thing you
need to know is if you get the dber 2025
calendar the desk calendar which is
available now there would be no tariff
because it's made in the United States
yeah no tariff made in the United States
um for the first time and uh because
it's more expensive to make it in the
United States I had to cut out the
publisher and cut out amazon.com and cut
out the bookstores now you can only get
it from one
website um and if you go to dilbert.com
you can find the link to buy it's right
at the top and um we're not going to
make a wall calendar this
year there wasn't as much demand for
those I know some of you will miss it
but it'll just be the daily and to make
it even better there are comics on both
sides of each day double the comics
you've ever seen in a dwor comic and if
you pay a little more for shipping maybe
that should take this thing out of it
and I say if you're going to buy more
than one it'll make your shipping cost
look a lot more
affordable so that's
happening um that's all I got for you
today and um I'm going to talk to locals
people
privately uh hope you learned something
did everybody learn anything about
economics today let me ask you this
question before I go was there anything
I said about
their tariffs or anything else that you
said oh I never saw it that way
before salt mines in the USA I don't
know if do we have any salt mines in the
USA we might
not why are they buying our
Farmland well if I had to guess it's for
food um here's the thing with China
if we got in a war with China we
wouldn't have ammunition in three weeks
but they wouldn't have food in three
weeks we're really not going to get in a
war with
China yeah yeah I feel like China is the
pretend adversary like we're pretending
that war is an option it's not an option
war is war with China is not an option
it's just not an
option we we've got to stop pretending
like it might happen no no what one of
the sides would have to want it at least
a little bit before you can consider
neither side wants it even a little bit
under any situation under any scenario
at all it's it's zero and zero you don't
get a war in that
case so I'm not worried about war with
China it's the lowest risk we have
