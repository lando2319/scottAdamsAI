hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
now i don't know how the weather is
where you are
but it's raining in my kitchen
yeah i wish it were only raining
outdoors
but it's also raining in my kitchen so
that's what i woke up to today
i guess there's a leak i'm gonna have to
take care of that
but it's not the first kitchen i've been
in and it was raining
for some reason all my kitchens end up
leaking
um how would you like to enjoy this
moment better than all the other moments
of the day yeah you would
and all you need is a copper mortar
glass a tanker tells us diana canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing makes
everything better except my kitchen
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
yeah that is better so
there's a mysterious new startup
or technology or service
it's a it's an interesting story it's
called a
big clout b-i-t-c-l-o-u-t
bit cloud and it looks like it's in beta
so i don't know that you can
get onto the site without a password yet
but what they've done is they
they've developed a market
for influencers so
people like me i'm actually one of the
the markets on there
you can buy an nft which is a digital
collectible
which has no intrinsic value just people
decide
to buy them and sell them and sometimes
the price goes up
so you can buy and sell these digital
units
and they're sort of registered on the
blockchain if you will
so that you can tell who has an original
and who might have a copy
and the copies would not have value but
the originals would
so i'm one of the influencers who are on
the
the early version of it so i'm number 36
on their list of course it's not a
complete list
but it looks like my uh my
my value let's see this is what i've
been
my market cap which is the value of all
the
crypto uh tokens or coins if you will
that people have bought that are
represented by me
so it's up to about a million dollars or
approaching a million dollars
so here's what's interesting about it
the technology
it looks like it's going to be some kind
of a substitute for social media
platforms
it looks like you can post things and
people like me can go and claim our our
uh
our account basically and i think i
would give some
monetary benefit from just claiming the
account
and from there i could just post and
here's the amazing part
apparently because it's an open source
and there's no one company that owns any
of the hardware or software
or even the development of it there's no
company
let me say that again there's a social
media platform
that's just springing up that doesn't
have a company
because the the technology is so
distributed you know you could run a
server and you know you'd be part of
this larger network
but there's no company now there is some
kind of entity
that's doing something but the the
technology
is not part of a company so i guess i
should say it that way
there is a company but the technology's
not part of it
isn't that interesting yeah and
here's even here's the here's the payoff
as i understand it i was just looking at
the white paper so there's a lot i don't
quite understand yet
but it looks like one of the things that
they're going to offer
is the ability for anybody to write an
algorithm
that works on their content so for
example if you don't want to live by
say the twitter algorithm or the
youtube algorithm you could just go over
to this
you know new social network and pick the
algorithm you want
from anybody who writes one say oh i
like i like the algorithm that
scott wrote i'll just use that one from
now on
so i don't know um
where this is headed yet but it is a
it is a social media platform killer
and you know lots of people have tried
to make alternate twitters and
alternate youtubes and stuff like that
and they've had limited success
but nobody's ever put all the parts
together like this
so whoever is behind this uh
they figured out how to put all the
parts together so just keep an eye on
this
it's called bit bitclout one word
b-i-t-c-l-o-u-t
all right uh putin continues to be one
of the funniest trolls
uh in the world so he was doing an
interview the other day
and he just said he had this idea that
the putin himself and biden should have
a
public conversation slash debate
uh live and televised
now putin
you
[Laughter]
that was so smart because
what does everybody in the united states
say to themselves as soon as they hear
that
that that putin and biden you know
potentially could be having a
conversation
in real time in front of the world
what's the first thing you think of
no no
we'll we'll be we'll look like fools
because putin apparently still has his
faculties
you might not like him apparently he's
done some bad things
but he still has all of his faculties
and this challenge
sort of proves it right because it was
such a
a clever troll thing to say oh yeah
why don't you take your national leader
and
i representing my country we'll talk in
public
oh you don't have a leader who can talk
in public
oh oh that's too bad
but we do over in russia we have a
leader who can actually go on tv
and talk in public without even
preparing
how about that so uh i'm gonna give the
uh i'm going to give an a plus to putin
for trolling that was really funny
it was cruel but it's really good
persuasion
every now and then you see these little
signs
that tell you how putin putin rose to
power
he just has a pretty good game you know
i'm not his fan
he should be condemned totally but he
does have a lot of game
in my ongoing series of the left
continuing to eat themselves
by having to live by their own rules
uh it seems like every day there's a new
example of it and here are a few
so there's a woman named alexi
mccammond and i believe
this is i think this is important to the
story
although it's a little confusing when
you look at her picture
but she identifies as black i think so
fact check me on that i don't want to be
wrong about that
but i believe she identifies as black
and
um so she uh got a job at kante nast
and it would be you know pretty high up
position and
she had to quit because of some
anti-asian
and anti-gay tweets in her past
and i'm thinking it's coming back to
bite you in the ass
so here she is she's uh i believe
again fact-checked me but i believe she
identifies as african-american
and here she is discriminating against
asians and gays allegedly
in these tweets so she had to show she
lost her job
so when the left follows their own rules
they lose her job here's a tweet about
joss whedon
director or uh i guess director right
of the new justice league and somebody
pointed out that the
parts that he reduced or cut by the time
he got to the final movie
uh you know five names were listed and
every one of them a person of color
that's right so joss whedon also
associated with the left
um he edits his movie but he only gets
rid of the people of color
and reduces their roles is that a
coincidence
well probably yes
it's probably exactly a coincidence and
the coincidence i'm just guessing
if i but if i had to guess that the
because he's using characters that were
developed you know 50 years ago or
whatever
they were mostly white superheroes i
think the people of color where people
were sort of
added on to add some balance and
diversity
but when you had to actually edit the
movie down to watch it
who are you going to get rid of you're
not going to cut the lines of the
main players or you wouldn't have your
continuity but you can almost always
edit
the you know the ancillary players
so probably it had nothing to do with
anything about
except how to edit and keep continuity
but i don't make the rules
i don't make the rules apparently the
rules say if you only cut the roles of
people of color you are a racist
so there's two stories just from today
you want to hear another one here here's
what i'm going to make up
all right so i told you before that the
best way
to defeat bad thinking
is to embrace it it's it's one of the
best
um techniques for persuasion
if somebody is asking you to do
something that's just sort of
batshit crazy and you can't talk them
out of it with logic
you don't have any power to change it
you know they won't listen to reason
what do you do well the one way to do it
is to
follow the rules and actually embrace
their bad idea
and then act as though you're you're
fully embracing it
now if you act like you're joking
it doesn't work if you act like you're
doing it
to be a jerk it doesn't work the secret
is to play it straight play a straight
right down the line right and
watch me do it right now i will now
model this behavior
so apparently there are 14 000 migrant
children
in federal custody right now that's
14 000 kids who
presumably with their parents decided to
come to a racist country
because if you've listened to black
lives matter and
and the democrats they will tell you
that this is one
super racist country and
i believe the rule is that if you
willingly and voluntarily
decide to go associate with a racist
entity
you are a racist
am i wrong in fact check me on that
is it wrong to say that i mean that
that's the statement about trump's
supporters right
it doesn't matter if you're technically
not a racist yourself
if you've decided to side with somebody
who we have labeled a racist you're a
racist by association
and you can't say that you're not
contributing to that racist system
because you are you are
and then you've got 14 000 kids who
uh now are trying very hard to associate
with this big
racist entity called the united states
and
i'm sorry but that does make them all
racists
it makes them all racists so
if you want to let 14 000 racists into
the country
well go ahead looks like that's going to
happen
now you see what i'm doing now in this
case you can tell that i'm
just joking but the point is every time
you make
people live by their own rules those
rules get a lot less popular
these rules exist as a weapon against
the other side
they can't be you know if you try to
employ them against both sides
they become very unpalatable um
and i think i told you my best story
about this i'll just do it quickly what
years ago when smoking was legal in
offices
um i complained and management wouldn't
do anything because smoking was legal
so my co-worker was a chain smoker there
was nothing i could do
so they sat around one day they said
around a forum that says do you
recognize
what they call it dangerous toxins and
stuff in the workplace dangerous
situations and you had to sign off on a
number of specific dangers to say that
you know these are dangerous things
and that you'll do what you need to do
to to avoid the danger
and one of them was second hand smoke
listed right on the corporate
document that that was considered a
dangerous
chemical and so i used the company the
company's
own standard and i said i won't be
coming back to work
because it's a i'm declaring this a
dangerous workplace because of the
second-hand smoke
using the company's rules i wasn't
making anything up i was just using the
company's own rules
and then i just started staying home and
i would call in once a day to find out
if the
if the toxic hazard had been remediated
and the first the first day my boss
thought i was joking
and so i played it completely straight i
said no i
understand from the company you made me
sign that i understood it
i literally was asked to sign that i
understood it the second hand smoke
could kill me
and also i've been asked to make sure
that i
remove myself from any unsafe
environments
so i'm doing right now exactly the
the company's required steps
took about three days and they changed
the policy
re you know re-uh relocated me to a
non-smoking place
etc now the key to this was that i never
was an
 i never rubbed it in
i never laughed about it i never mocked
it
i never i never even called the rules
ridiculous
i simply addressed them exactly with the
policy as it had been presented to me
you want to hear another example when i
when i was a bank teller
we would have all these rules about what
we could or could not do and if you
violated any of those rules you could
get fired or you know get a penalty of
some sort
and we would often bend those rules
because a lot of our customers were
regulars so it's just somebody you see
every day
and you knew them and maybe you wouldn't
ask for their their driver's license
because you know them literally somebody
you've checked their driver's license 10
times
and the supervisor comes over and i
guess i did something wrong one day and
said
you've got to follow all these these
rules have to be followed
there can be no bending of the rules
when it comes to
banking you know banking you got to
follow the rules
so i said i would be happy to do that
and my line went out the door and around
the block
because if you followed the rules you
couldn't serve
even one customer because everybody had
some weird exception that required a
supervisor
if you did it right but before we're
like ah it's such a small thing
you'll just you know forget it so
and of course it took about half a day
for the supervisor to say okay okay
forget the rules
because if you follow the rules we can't
we can't even do business
so following the rules is very
effective if the rules are ridiculous
so i guess the biden white house is
firing staffers
who have ever admitted smoking weed
what what
now this is not even people who are
currently smoking weed
this is just people who have some time
in their past
admitted to smoking weed which by the
way
depending on the state they were doing
it and when they did it was perfectly
legal
now how does that play with democrats
now i suppose if they say well it
doesn't affect me it's just
this government thing but does it look
so good does it
oh i see you're you're prompting me in
the in the
in the comments here don't get ahead of
me
yeah kamala harris has famously admitted
that she once
or i don't know how many times but she
has smoked marijuana
now suppose
suppose we apply the law
just the way biden wants to
don't you have to impeach harris
or remove her or something
see it's really tough for them to follow
their own rules
but this this might be one of the
dumbest things the
biden white house has done i mean this
is super dumb
there's some things which you say to
yourself you know
uh maybe i don't know all the details or
or
maybe maybe there's a variable i haven't
considered
or you know maybe it's complicated and
nobody can make a prediction so you
don't really know what to do
but this is one of those rare situations
where you can look at this and just say
nope this is just stupid
it's only stupid there's nothing else
about it
all right there's no complexity to this
one usually even when something stupid
you can say yeah i see why they did it
you know maybe they felt they were
forced into doing it
but there's nothing like that here
there's nothing
to suggest that this is a good idea it's
just it's just a messed up idea
so here's the list of countries that
biden's administration or biden himself
has offended
russia china
north korea i would argue israel
canada and germany
and that's just so far now let me ask
you this
remember how it was always big news and
it seemed like a really big deal
the other countries might be laughing
about trump behind his back
that's pretty bad isn't it they might be
laughing behind trump's back
well first of all do you think do you
think
leaders don't laugh about the other
leaders behind their back
i got a feeling that's kind of common
right because it's just like
anybody else gossiping about anything
i'm sure there's a little bit of that
but how in the world do we imagine that
the other countries are not seeing what
we see
in biden they see it too
right it's it's not just
us
so do we not think that they're laughing
at biden
and his mental capacity they have to be
of course they are
we hear now that the biden
administration is quietly pressuring
mexico to
curb migrants who does that remind you
of
huh oh yeah trump
every day that goes by trump will look
smarter
perfect day it's a perfect day to you
know we'll talk about the
china talk but today is a day when uh
trump looked extra smart
because the immigration things fell
apart
they're gonna have to do what trump did
or some form of it eventually
and then the china talks were a hot mess
so if you didn't see the story
tony blinken from the biden
administration so he was meeting in
alaska i guess with
chinese counterparts and
of course he wanted to bring up you know
china's uh
human rights abuses uyghurs and stuff
like that
but uh china wasn't having it and they
brought up black lives matter and all
the racism in the united states
and said maybe you should take care of
your own problem
and do you see now the problem
with the united states making everything
about race
china just used the same trick
that i just have been explaining china
instead of saying hey we're not so bad
or those things you're accusing of us of
we didn't do that
nope they took the biden
administration's
own philosophy and shoved it down their
throats
in public that's what they did
they took their own philosophy and
shoved it down their throats
in public didn't even bother to try to
explain away their own behavior
because they didn't have to they could
just take
biden's own philosophy and shove it down
his throat
in public and his philosophy being it's
a big old racist country
and we've got tons of problems here
so here's what happens when you
create a narrative for internal domestic
purposes
the narrative being everything's racist
all the time
and it has an effect
because china or let me put it this way
as a doctor password123 on twitter
uh noted and i'll use his exact wording
we apparently lost the moral high ground
to a country that harvests
human organs from minority groups
that actually happened
that actually happened now you can't
fail harder than that tony blinken
you can't fail harder than losing the
moral ground to a country that harvests
human organs from minority groups
that's that's as hard as you can fail um
and uh i checked the doordash app
and if you search for chinese food now
there's a picture of tony
blinken yeah
that's terrible um
here's a persuasion tip from twitter
user dan
who noticed that tony blinken's twitter
profile
starts out by saying that he's a very
amateur guitar player
and so dad notes and i agree don't ever
put the
terms quote very amateur anything
in your biography if you're an official
in anything
it subconsciously communicates that
you're an amateur at your profession too
we associate the words with what we are
so
and i agree completely with that
statement
i will say that self-deprecation
has a place right i i would not be the
one who says oh never use
self-deprecation i use it
when it's funny but here's when you
should not use it
when it can actually work against your
professional reputation
so yeah that's the time to not be
self-deprecating
but you can do it on like minor things
don't be self-deprecating about your
entire ability
or your professional talents but be
self-deprecating about you know maybe
little personality quirks or stuff like
that
um how many of you saw the
uh clip of kamala harris
falling apart on good morning america
with uh
when she was being interviewed by
savannah guthrie about the school
openings
how many of you saw that clip and
there's a reason i'm asking
just want to see if anybody saw it well
i'm going to guess that not many of you
did
now i saw it on social media but i
didn't see it on the news sites
and here's why i'm asking
kamala harris absolutely fell apart
she fell apart if you saw
her that interview you would say to
yourself
we don't have a vice president she did
not look
even the minimum capability of an
official who talks in public
i'm talk i'm saying that she did not
seem to have the
uh the poise and the ability to answer
tough questions
that you would see from you know
a dog catcher or anybody
it was so bad the reason i asked if
you'd seen that i'll bet they i'll bet
they got rid of that clip
i'll bet that clip is not something
that's going to go around on abc's
site maybe i mean i could be wrong about
that but
it's the worst thing i've ever seen
from a professional politician i've
never seen anybody handle questions
so awkwardly and almost looking like
i'm not saying she was drunk but
almost like she was drunk not not in
terms of mannerisms and i don't believe
she had any
she wasn't she was not inebriated so let
me be clear about that
but in terms of how well she performed
it was maybe how well you would perform
not in the same style of course if you'd
had
several strong drinks i mean it was
really bad
and keep in mind that we've all seen her
talk a lot of times and she's bad
generally she's sort of routinely bad
but you haven't seen this level of bad
for a moment there we had a president
and a vice president who were incoherent
i mean she was actually incoherent i
don't know what was going on maybe it
was a bad day
but she doesn't look like anybody who
could step in and take over
not one time did mike pence
ever look like he couldn't take over
am i right not one time i i'm probably
the biggest mike pence supporter on the
planet
because of the dog that didn't bark
the mistakes he didn't make
are pretty pretty legendary really
i would say pence as a vice president he
set the standard in my opinion
um even if you don't like even if you
don't like him as a politician even if
you don't
like his policies and i'm not on his
team on all that stuff
so here's one thing that i think will be
interesting which is that the longer
trump is out of the headlines
and it's going to weaken people's
reflex resistance so
for a long time if as long as trump was
in power
anything you said that was uh let's say
explaining him or anything would meet
with massive resistance
but you notice that after he was out of
power
the fine people hoax finally fell
because it's just not so important to
keep up the
you know keep up the other side once
he's out of power
and we're seeing this happening now with
the the drinking bleach hoax
so yesterday that popped up again i
guess dr burke said it or something
and now you're seeing people who are
um responding to it on social media
by sending around the actual technology
that does exactly what president trump
said
which is an elect allows you to inject
a disinfectant into the body
to treat the coronavirus
that's a real thing the company is heal
light
all one word like healing and light heal
light and it's aytu bioscience
and they've got a website and it's been
around a while
this is the same technology that trump
would have known about
because it was being tweeted around at
the time he he talked about
light being injected and sure enough
they put the light
on a ventilator-like device they inject
it
now that's not a medical term maybe but
they inject it down the throat into the
trachea
and then the uv light sprays out from
the device
and it kills coronavirus now i don't
know how far along they are in terms of
commercializing it but the point is it
exists
as real it's what it's what trump was
referring to
and i was watching the resistance to it
online
because this this pops up ever since it
happened it's been popping up
and um somebody said youtube was
blocking that
that website i wonder if they were uh
so my point is that
uh people seem to
be easier to convince that they had been
hoaxed
on this so watch as one after another
all the
all the trump hoaxes finally
get handled after he's out of office
so do we miss new miss trump yet so
we've got
biden failing massively on immigration
we've got biden's team embarrassing
itself
with the china talks we've got higher
taxes coming
that are very unpopular
every day that goes by right every day
that goes by
another hoax is debunked about trump
and the biden administration finds out
that the only thing they can do that
makes sense is whatever trope was doing
and they're going to have to you know
try to try to imitate that
um
let me just look at your comments here
use high viscosity not going to read
that comment
um what do we think is going to happen
with china
you know i put a little uh video on this
on
the locals platform today but uh i want
to make this
this prediction also publicly which is
if we're trying to figure out will china
come to dominate
and take over the united states or will
the united states do okay
i feel as if every major power
forever has reached some pinnacle
and then they decline so as the united
states reached its pinnacle
and now it'll be on the decline while
china is rising
because if you just straight-line it it
looks like that right
but i would argue that what the united
states has going for it
is that we continually destroy ourselves
to reinvent
indeed i would say that we've had
several different ways to elect a
president
just in my lifetime most recently it was
about rules changes and
the pandemic and before that it was
probably fake news and russian
interference and stuff
so even even our most basic system of
how we pick a president
it's not really the same one one
election to the next
we destroy everything intentionally
because that's how we grow we're we're
in a
we're in a continuous uh death birth
cycle but is china now china's made
tremendous changes
so we know that they can they can do
huge
changes when needed but
is their system as flexible as ours
there must be a reason that they're they
haven't invented as many big
technologies etc
i don't know what that reason is but
there but it could have to do with the
system
and i think our system yeah creative
destruction somebody's saying that would
be a good way to do it
our system of continuous creative
destruction
um makes us unlike i would say
the roman empire because i think the
roman empire just tried to be the roman
empire
and you know the the mongol empire
just tried to be mongols but the united
states we're just trying to be something
else every other day
you know right now we're we're bringing
back our manufacturing from china
it's a pretty big change that's a pretty
big change but we
you know we can turn on a dime when we
need to
so i would think that innovation wise
and our ability
to cannibalize ourselves and our
lower level of corruption are probably
going to keep us in good shape
for a long time
yeah and i think china's got a big you
know demographic problems and everything
else
so
uh just and we have a navigable
mississippi river network
that's important is that still important
in 2021 is it
important
all right yeah the other thing that's
going to happen in china is the middle
class will
start asking for stuff and then the
power structure is going to change a
little bit
um yeah there's a lot of stuff in china
that's newer and better than
than ours that's for sure
have you noticed that it's a really
tough time to be a massage therapist
so now you've got this football player
who's accused of raping one you've got a
shooting in seattle at another massage
parlor
you've got the atlanta shooting why all
of a sudden
massage parlors are
having such unhappy endings what's up
with that
all right um that's all for now
and i'm gonna go take care of some other
stuff and i will talk to you
later
i'm gonna make this short today i could
go do some other stuff
and i'll talk to you a little bit later
