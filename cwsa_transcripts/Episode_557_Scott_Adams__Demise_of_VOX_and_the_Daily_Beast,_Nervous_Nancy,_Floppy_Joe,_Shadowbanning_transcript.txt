hey everybody come on in here
you better get in here while it's still
possible
while social media still allows you to
find me
i don't know how much longer this will
last
starting to think that
my rain here on periscope might be
winding down but we'll see
so we'll talk about all that but before
we do
i know why you're here it has to do with
a simultaneous sip
maybe you're grabbing a cup or a glass
or a mug right now could it be a steiner
chalice or a tankard a vessel of any
kind
maybe a thermos or a flask fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
of the simultaneous sip
i would like to begin
by reiterating a clarification
from yesterday
um
i had
some days ago i had tweeted a
tweeted a i'd retweeted something by joe
koncha
it was an article written by somebody
else in which
the somebody else
repeated the fine people fake news
and i had commented on that but i think
sometime between the time that i tweeted
it
and the time i talked about it on
periscope i had conflated in my mind
the tweeter and the author
and had mistakenly
identified
joe concha as the author but he was
actually a tweeter
of an article that had one line of fake
news in it
now
joe asked me to apologize publicly
to which i say
of course
if anybody's going to apologize publicly
for a mistake
you should be the creator of the 48-hour
rule so i did just that
but i added the i added a tweet so
there's something he has that he can he
can look at and forward if anybody if
anybody gives him a trouble
he'll have something specific that he
can just forward to them so i'm
taking the apology
off of its original place periscope
and putting it in addition on twitter
so that it's it's written instead of
spoken
anyway um i suggest that all of you do
the same
which is if somebody asks you to correct
an error that you do it right away
acknowledge it and correct it
and so i have enough about that let me
get to my prediction i'm going to make
the following prediction
the two publications
will be out of business within 12 months
one is vox
and the other is the daily beast so my
prediction is
both of those publications will
cease to exist within 12 months
the reasons being
different but
but somehow similar
number one
well vox of course has the problem that
their brand has somehow now become
synonymous with
their the worst person who works there
what's his name carlos
carlos massa i forget his name
but uh so he's he's becoming
controversial because he caused
apparently some
demonetization of stephen crowder and
maybe some other people
and
what this did was raise his profile
and unfortunately
his profile is the very worst thing that
you could want
as your as your banner
i remember the first time i saw one of
his videos so i didn't i didn't know him
didn't know he was associated with vox
didn't do anything about him i just saw
a video i remember watching the video
and thinking myself
am i watching the worst human being i've
ever seen in my life
i mean i'm not talking about people who
are mass murderers they're they're worse
but in terms of a person who's not
actually you know physically hurting
anybody
at least directly
i i thought my god the the fake news and
the
the whole presentation seems designed to
cause some kind of a race war
and then as it went on it was it was
obvious that he just wasn't racist
of course that's always an opinion right
everybody gets to have their own opinion
of who's a racist
right
there there's no test
it's subjective isn't it
now if i i watched his presentation and
my impression my opinion and this is
honest by the way my honest opinion
is that he's just a racist
now
i get to have that opinion i'm pretty
sure
but anyway so vox has two problems
apparently their writers are on strike
that's not good apparently they weren't
making money before
and they've just destroyed any hope they
have of
of a good reputation in the world thanks
to this this one employee
who's so extra extra bad i've you know
i
i i don't know how they can keep them on
but apparently they they like what he's
doing he gets a lot of clicks
so i think vox
the reputation is gone their business
model is broken
and more importantly
they have just painted a giant target on
their backs
so from a business perspective
you don't ever want to do
what vox did
from a business
perspective
it's one thing to have uh half of the
country or whatever the percentage is
it's it's one thing to have a part of
the country like you
and a part of the country that says ah
you're not my thing
any business can survive that situation
they only need that the people who don't
like them
don't care that much
do you get it
here's the important part they only need
in order to be successful you need some
people who like you which they have
but you also necessarily need some
people
who the people who don't like you to
also not care
they just don't care one way or another
they're just ignoring you
that situation changed
vox now just angered
half of the united states
i'm not exaggerating but there's some
large number of
conservatives who have just said to
themselves huh
if there were ever a way to legally hurt
vox i would certainly do it
because they've they've outed themselves
as
not a credible player not
not interested in reality not interested
in anything but really creating a bad
situation in the country in return for
clicks
so when you have that many people who
are now motivated
to do something to act against your
interests
well i don't know exactly how this will
play out
it could turn into more lawsuits it
could turn out to pressure on their
advertisers
you don't know how it will play out
but vox says crossed a line
from something that you didn't like but
you could easily ignore
to something that is now literally an
enemy
they're an enemy of the people but
they're a double enemy of the class that
they've identified for attack
likewise the daily beast i think has
is unlikely to be around for similar
reasons that there are some publications
that seem to have crossed some kind of
weird line
from from at least pretending to be
something like news or something like
you know a legitimate publication to
something else something darker and so i
think i think both of those publications
are unlikely to last 12 months that's my
that's my prediction
all right let's talk about
twitter
has some new rules terms of service
apparently they've shortened them and i
did a quick look and i saw nothing that
i would that i would object to
twitter looks to be
like they have some kind of a
more clear easier to read
ideas about what violates their terms of
service what kind of things would get
you kicked off so that's all good
i would
love to see but don't expect it
that if there were ever a perfect time
for twitter to do in amnesty
meaning allowing back on the platform
people who had been kicked off before
so long as
what they got kicked off for
was
something that would have been okay
under the clarified terms uh
terms of service
so i think it would be an amazing uh
amazing for their reputation and
everything else if they did
some or at least considered some kind of
a mass
forgiveness of people
who maybe didn't understand their terms
of service because by their own
by their own reckoning they were too
complicated and maybe people violated
them without knowing
but now that they've clarified them
this is really the perfect time
to say okay now it's more clear
try it again
and if you violated it again maybe uh
you know maybe you have to be banned
again but at least it's clear this would
be the perfect time to do it i don't
expect it to happen
here's why i don't expect it to happen
um i told you that my
twitter
traffic fell off a ledge
in the last week
and
i've suggested and i'm going to suggest
this again here's a here's a concept
that is so true across all different
areas and fields and projects and
interests that you should always keep
this in mind
it's the it's the probably the central
rule of management if you had to have
one rule
about management it would be this
if you can measure it
you can manage it
if you can't measure it
you can't make you can't manage it
so when you look at you know managers
what they're doing you will find that
the things that they can
measure they're going to actually do a
good job on because they can test things
and and they will they will operate on
things that can be measured it's just
human nature
and and it makes sense commonsensically
as well
if you look at
shadow banning and throttling and all
the allegations about what the social
media networks are doing under the hood
to suppress certain kinds of people and
opinions
what's the problem with that
if you wanted to fix that
could you
not if it can't be measured you can't
fix it and the only people who could
measure it are the people who are not
going to tell you
if hypothetically there's something
going on
those people would not want you to know
so therefore there's no way to measure
it and so i ask myself
is there no way to measure it
is is there no way
for
external entities
to identify it without having the
insider information that only the
companies themselves would have
i don't know
but i just used a tool
that you saw me tweet for aj cortez's
account
somebody alerted me that there's a way
you can test for shadow banning
you just look on my latest tweet you can
you can see it
and i forget what it's called somebody
will say it in the comments here
and i ran that and it said that sure
enough
aj cortez
was being prohibited from the
suggestions so in other words if you're
looking for like-minded people sometimes
it suggests who you follow
and it actually came up with the result
that he'd been banned
now he said that in the last three
months his his twitter followers
went from healthy growth every month to
boom just fell off a cliff
and then i said that mine fell off a
cliff a week ago now the first question
i ask
the first question i ask
is is this shadow bending tool
accurate
is it accurate can somebody fact check
that for me
and that's what i tweeted i i asked for
a fact check i don't know
if we can trust
yeah yes it's called
shadowband.edu
so shadow
ban
as one word shadowban
dot eu
so i'm looking for information as to
whether that's accurate because if it's
accurate it shows that they did in fact
throttled somebody who i would consider
not even slightly controversial
certainly nothing that would violate
terms of service
um
people of course are telling me every
day that they're not seeing my tweets
and they don't get the notifications
that stuff i can never tell if that has
to do with the settings or
or or
selective memory or any of that so it's
hard to it's hard to determine from that
but the other thing i did recently was
um i told you i'm using an app called
socialblade
and it's a free app
and if you have more than one account
it's handy
because as you can see
i set it up for my two main social media
accounts it doesn't matter you can see
them so one is for twitter
and the other is for youtube
now those are probably
comparable in the sense
that um
you know i have
i use them both every day so i put
content on them every day and i put
similar content on them every day so the
things i say on periscope are very
similar to and often i talk about my
tweets
so you should expect
that their movement
would be similar
now not exact and this is not a science
but i'm suggesting ways that maybe there
could be external checks
on things so what i did was i go to my
uh list of
twitter followers
and i can see here that they have been
healthy hundreds a day and then it just
falls off a ledge in the past week
so what i do is okay if twitter traffic
fell off in the last week
does that mean it's just summer because
that could be a thing right it's not
unusual for summer to slow down social
media traffic so i go over to youtube
and i don't see the same drop
so the same days that you would have
expected if it were just summer
youtube would go down too about the same
wouldn't it if let's say internet
traffic dropped by 20 just because it's
summer
i would see a 20 drop in twitter
something like it was 20 drop on youtube
right
but i don't
i see a sudden drop on twitter
not matched by a sudden drop on youtube
same content
same time
publishing every day
is that meaningful i think it is because
even if you imagine that youtube is
doing some throttling i don't know if
they are in my case and if you imagine
that twitter is doing some throttling
and again i can't confirm that they are
you would expect that they might not do
it at the same time and in the same way
so whenever you saw a disconnect
you know a sudden drop of traffic on a
let's say a comparable platform
and and finding comparables might be the
hard hard part here
that should raise the flag
correct so what i'm doing is i'm
suggesting that there should be some
ways
to have a compare platforms
and find any disconnects and flag it
so in my case
i would say the evidence strongly
suggests there's something going on here
that's terrible now i was reading a
little bit
on the shadowband.eu site about how they
do things a little bit of explanation
and they had
a scary
paragraph talking about twitter's
official response
to whether or not shadow banning happens
and apparently they use some very
specific
lawyer
lawyer-like language
to say we're not shadow banning
but then they define shadow banning
in such a limited way
that it's not really what we're talking
about
so one of the things that apparently
would not be shadow banning because the
way they defined it
would be if your tweets don't show up if
my tweets don't show up in your feed
that's not called shadow banning
apparently
because you can still go to my uh you
can still go directly to my account and
read all my tweets so my tweets are not
hidden
they're all every one of them is right
there on my twitter feed
it's just that you might not see them
perhaps like aj cortez
maybe you just don't come up as a
recommended
person to follow
would that be shadow bending well by all
of our definitions yes
by the definition of
of twitter apparently no
so
here's the big issue
i cannot determine nork in any of you
whether there's really something going
on here because every time you think you
see something
it isn't that different from what
confirmation bias would look like and
you got to keep that in your head
to stay sane
so for example
is aj cortez the the fact that that one
piece of software identified that he was
being
shadow banned
is that real
i don't know
how do you and i know that that piece of
software that shadowband.edu how do we
know that's accurate how do we know that
it doesn't have false positives we don't
know
how reliable is software from people you
don't know
not reliable
right in general it's not reliable i
don't know
any way
to to test that
now
so what i would suggest is that
developers and people who understand how
to use the apis of these various
services
find some way to find comparables
so for example
let's say here's another suggestion
that's in the same line let's say you
had
you know my account my twitter account
and aj cortez account
let's say you were determined and i'm
not sure this is the case but let's say
you you had determined that they do
similar kinds of things and they have a
lot of followers in common
so the content and the followers have a
lot in common
and let's say you added them to several
other accounts which you found largely
similar they might be
the same scale same size they might be
similar content similar followers
and then you say to yourself
do any one of them showed sudden drops
because probably whatever would be
happening that would look like shadow
banding would probably hit some people
first
and may not have the same effect on
every person who is there
let's say they're comparable
so that's one way to measure you could
say oh
aj cortez took a drop
the comparables did not so he's being
targeted
or the comparables on other platforms
did not take a drop at the same time
therefore he's being targeted
you wouldn't always know but perhaps you
could if you were looking at enough
accounts over time both comparing within
the within the social media and also
across platforms
could you find a statistical
reliable way to say something's going on
here
i think so
i think the smartest people in the world
can figure out how to do that
but you always have the problem that you
couldn't confirm it
so even if you were sure you were
getting it right you probably couldn't
confirm it
so that's a problem all right let's move
on um did you hear that michael wolff uh
he was a big anti-trumper who wrote a
wrote some crappy book full of lies and
then he had a follow-up book that's
another crappy book full of lies about
the president
did you notice that
he sort of came and went and nobody
cared
so cnn had him on
but maybe only once
because michael wolff is so his
credibility is
well i i referred to him on twitter as
the poor man's michael avenatti
and
if let me put it this way if someone can
refer to you as the poor man's michael
avenatti
and people who read my tweets say oh you
got a point there he is sort of the poor
man's michael avenatti
if you find that people will laugh at
that because it seems true
well
well
maybe maybe it's time to not be on cnn
so much
so i think cnn has learned from their
michael avenatti episode so that even
the poor man's michael avenatti doesn't
get much attention
honestly i don't even know what michael
wolff said this time i i knew he had a
book i didn't click on a single link
did you
did any of you click on any michael
wolff has a new book story every time i
saw one i said well i'm not clicking on
that
because i know there's nothing in there
that's real
i imagine that the those who measure
that measure these sorts of things
noticed
i have a suggestion
that is very very self-serving for how
to help with conservatives who are
demonetized i'm gonna toss this out here
because i don't know if it's a brilliant
idea or a terrible idea but i know for
sure so before you say it
let me acknowledge
this is
at least partly
self-serving
all right so don't think that i don't
have self-interest in this idea but
uh you could take me out of the idea and
the idea would still stand alone all
right so i'm going to use i'm going to
use suggestion for dealing with these
demonetized people
uh
you might recognize where this
suggestion comes from but i'm not going
to say it
here's the idea
my startup
has a
crypto token called the when
we have millions of them which are worth
nothing unless people decide to use them
and trade them and use them within the
app or they can use them on outside the
app on exchanges they can trade them etc
so the only thing that makes any crypto
token or coin uh useful is demand
suppose
suppose and i'm not i'm not offering
this yet i just want to fly it out there
suppose i were to gift
um
the larger conservatives who got
de-platformed with a whole bunch of when
tokens all they would need to receive
them
is just open up a
you know an interface account or have a
erc20
wallet very easy i mean a couple of
minutes to set up an account i could
just say to somebody like a dave rubin
or uh
or uh or a stephen crowder
and again it wouldn't be for every
person so i would even i would probably
have to pick my areas but i looked for
people who
had not done something so bad they were
kicked off a platform entirely
but it only done something so bad they
got demonetized
i could say
here's a bunch of when
all you have to do is accept that
there's no obligation
and then anybody who wanted to support
those people could simply also buy the
token
you could buy them at onehub.com you
could buy them on
hotbit
io and some other exchanges so you could
buy them in a variety of ways and if
anybody buys them for any reason to use
it within my app simply to support these
creators to use it as your own gifts
because you can also gift it to people
so you could buy the when and say hey
dave rubin you got demonetized if if he
gets demonetized and say here's some
when
you know not a lot i'll give you 20
worth whatever
that demand
would become self-fulfilling
in other words the mere fact that lots
of people were buying it just to help
people who had been demonetized
would create its value
and so the people who got them for
nothing
because i decided to give them a bunch
would make
a million dollars
so you could make somebody like stephen
crowder or
dave rubin or yeah i'm talking about the
people who are not going to get kicked
off a platform but might be throttled
they might be demonetized
and i could just say all right here's a
bunch of when
if the public wants these to be valuable
and they want you to be
rich because you got demonetized
you can do it easily
all right so i'm not going to say that's
uh somebody says it's too complicated
well let me simplify it
i would i would tell these people to
open up a wallet that takes about a
minute
they just put in their information takes
about a minute
and then i can send them stuff and they
don't even have to do anything it'll
just you know they'll just appear in
their wallet i mean it's a simple
process
they don't have to do anything
if if the when never becomes valuable
enough that they say hey let me cash
these in then that's it that's the whole
process
if it does become valuable
cashing it in is simple you just sign up
for one of the exchanges and trade it
for bitcoin
trade it for u.s dollars that sort of
thing
all right that's the idea i'll just
leave that out there for a minute um do
you see that russia seems to be testing
us on the sea and in the air so there is
a story about a near collision at sea
and then that's been added to some
stories about some uh russian
aircraft intercepted some uh
u.s military planes in international
waters
here's what i asked you about this
is this real i have a real concern
that the news about russia playing
chicken with the united states
is based on real events i mean i think
the actual reported events are
completely real
but there's something i'm worried about
here and let me get to it
it seems that the um the key piece of
this
is the um the naval thing that happened
so the two ships the russian ship and
the u.s ship came within i don't know
150 feet of each other which is way too
dangerous and it looks like the russians
did it intentionally
now that's being used
as sort of the the main story and then
they add oh but they they did these
things in the air and they tried to
intercept us in the air etc
but here's the thing
i think the air interceptions
are not that unusual are they
i don't know how unusual they are
because it seems to me
that our military militaries at least in
the air
are sort of testing each other every now
and then you know we we get near their
airspace to test their defenses they get
near our airspace to test our defenses
they do an intercept for
sometimes a reason that makes sense to
them sometimes it doesn't so i don't
know how much the air stuff
is different or bigger or newer or more
dangerous
than normal so that's just a question
mark right
but when i saw this naval one
this one looks suspicious to me and
here's why
if you have never had experience sailing
you wouldn't know
what i'm going to tell you next
which is that
ships and boats
have rules of right right of way
right it has to do with the size of the
ship and the direction and stuff and i
don't know all the rules but it is true
there's something called a right-of-way
and it's an understanding that everybody
on the ocean knows for example if you're
in a narrow channel of water and there's
a very large uh ship coming your way
and it looks like it's in your way and
you're on a small boat
the big ship has the right of way that's
the rule the reason is the small ship
can get out of the way easily
so the big ship has the right-of-way
over the small ship but there are other
rules about
who's doing what that are also
understood now
my understanding about this near
collision
is that the u.s ship
slowed down artificially because it was
landing some um
i think helicopters
so you had a russian ship who believed
probably they had the right-of-way
and you had a u.s ship which normally
would be
traveling at a higher speed
but slowed down
now
did the russian ship know that the u.s
ship was in a process landing a
helicopter that required it to slow down
i don't know
because it's possible that russia simply
misread the situation and said
russia has the right-of-way
and in order to sort of maintain our you
know our status if you will or whatever
our respect
they decided to make sure that they did
not lose their right of way they didn't
want to be scared off
their right away because they had the
right away
now if all the russians did
was pursue their right of way
and it got too close because they
misjudged what the us was doing which
was slowing down to land some
helicopters
would it have looked
very much like what happened and have
nothing to do with them testing us
maybe
yeah i'm not sure that the bigger ship
is the only criteria
for right of way i'm not a i'm not a
sailor so somebody who knows this stuff
uh
ideally somebody who has naval
experience can answer that
um but
before you before you decide
that the us and russia have some kind of
military conflict just about ready to
happen
i would ask you to at least consider
that the news industry wants some news
and they want it to be about russia
and i just don't know
if these are coincidences that they
packaged up as news
it might be
so i'm gonna so here's my my temporary
position
is that it's leaning fake news
it's leaning fake news
i'm not gonna conclude that but if i had
to bet on it and you said
scott you've got about a thousand
dollars
that this is either the beginning of
some dangerous trend
or it's a bunch of coincidences and and
an accident
which do you bet i would bet
fake news so
doesn't mean it's true but that's where
i bet all right
um
i saw there was somebody who was uh
described as an architect of the green
new deal
all right so this is a person who uh
i'll tell you the name in a second
not aoc but somebody who worked on it
her first name is rihanna
and i'll tell you the last name in a
moment because
the simulation is just so wonderful you
know the simulation is the idea that
we're actually just made of software and
there's some creator because when you
see coincidences like this one
that i'm going to describe in a moment
you have to ask yourself
is this really a coincidence well it
probably is but it's still funny
here it is so somebody who's the
architect of the green new deal her
first name is rihanna
is of course the most lefty left you
could ever be
so you can't really be the architect of
the green new deal unless you're super
left right
what is the last name of the person
who is identified with being super left
well it's a hyphenated name
so obviously her husband
she and her husband have different last
names and they hyphenated
i don't know which name was which but
one of the
names was gun
g-u-n-n gun
and the other name was right w-r-i-g-h-t
and they decided to hyphenate it in this
order
gun right
gun rights
the most lefty person in the united
states her last name is gun rights
i didn't make that up
oh somebody said could be a woman's
spouse you were correct you're correct
i mistakenly said that
assumed that she was married to a man
and i should not assume that
so her spouse
had a different name so
i don't know what to say about it it's
just so funny i looked at it and i
thought am i reading this right
is the leftiest person in the united
states actually named after the second
amendment because that's just too good
and did she not see that
when when they decided to name
because i don't know would it be better
or worse if it was right gun
right gun would
not be as
as on the nose as
gun rights but rare
anyway so she made a prediction in some
article
that uh the if we don't do the green new
deal or maybe even if we do the climate
change
problem is this big this is how big she
says the climate change problem is
that uh we're talking about 150 million
deaths
which he described as 25 holocausts
now
first of all anybody who compares
anything to the holocaust is
that loses all credibility
for me
i don't care who you are what you're
talking about i don't care if you're
left or right if you're comparing your
crap
whatever that is
to the holocaust
i'm sorry
there's almost nothing else i can hear
you say after that because
there's nothing that compares to the
holocaust there are other bad things
but they're different
never
never compare anything to the holocaust
unless it's you know exactly like it i
suppose
but what are the odds let's say you were
asked to make a bet
and here's the bet
you have to bet
that 150 million extra people will die
because of the temperature going up
at least 1.5 degrees
or you have to bet
that fewer people will die in other
words people will be saved
there will be fewer deaths than ever
even with the climate change which way
would you bet
would you bet that this is the time that
the doom and gloomers are right and 150
million people die
or that actually less will die than have
been dying historically
well if you studied history
or
bjorn lomborg anything he's he writes
about
um in terms of the risks of death you
would see that we we've become so good
at avoiding death even if the problem is
the same or bigger
that if you were going to bet on it you
would bet that nobody died
that would be the smart bet
even if
climate change is exactly what the
scientists say
even if it's on the high end
i would bet the number of deaths
will be zero
and probably fewer people will die than
used to die just from other old reasons
so the the obvious examples are we're
better at surviving and predicting
storms
uh if the if the ocean rises people
aren't going to be standing on the beach
and suddenly drown they're going to have
years to say hey
this this used to be up to my ankles but
now it seems like it's up to my shins
i don't think people are going to drown
because the ocean got bigger
now what about
death from famine
well do you think that in 30 years we'll
be better or worse at getting food to
people who need it
we're going to be way better
it's not even going to be close
30 years from now
probably nobody will starve
no matter what's happening it wouldn't
matter you know the temperature could be
so hot outside that you barely can go
outdoors during the summer
and people still
would be less likely to starve because
we're so much better
at getting food to people
all right
so i think that's ridiculous um
attorney general bill barr
this was from
i think fox news report said
got a surprise this week when he hosted
a listening session
for civil rights groups supposedly
concerned about the justice department's
commitment
to police reform
hardly anybody showed up
bill barr i guess he promised uh during
his uh confirmation hearings he promised
kamala harris
that if he were
confirmed he would have the justice
department looked into police reform now
i'm assuming that police reform
refers to
um
anything that would look like racial
bias i assume that's the context right
correct me if i'm wrong
but i think it has to do with police
shootings and and racial bias
so remember i told you that um
black lives matter just sort of
disappeared
like you just don't even hear about them
anymore they went from a big deal to i
guess they
did they disband and do they still have
meetings i don't even know
so imagine that the attorney general
holds a listening session
specifically to hear what
you know those kinds of concerns are and
almost nobody shut up it was just a big
waste of time
i and i told you that we haven't had a
as far as i know a high-profile police
shooting that is one of those
questionable ones where people say hey
what's going on there somebody says it's
the body cams
well remember i suggested that
instead of
talking about it we just make sure that
there are more body cams because the
body cams kind of solve all those
problems
i mean don't solve all the problems but
it comes pretty close
so
it feels like a problem
that just sort of
people stopped caring about or that they
stopped talking about it or did it
get solved did something happen
sort of a mystery
but it's a problem that literally just
went away
now everybody's talking about
president trump's
threat that he would impose tariffs on
mexico if they don't do more to control
their border and
what we're hearing is um
some positive stuff about mexico's
response apparently they sent a bunch of
their own
national guard their version of the
national guard to the border of
guatemala
so they've armed you know they've
fortified their their military presence
on the guatemalan border to keep people
from coming in the first place there's
some talk about
changing their immigration
sort of uh
you know
what's the rule
what's the word about
people who want asylum their asylum
rules so then mexico might be looking at
some of their laws
and
there's something else they did
oh they started freezing some
bank accounts of people who were
suspected of trafficking and
i guess trafficking and immigration
being part of the same conversation
so here's the question
did president trump's threat of
terrorists
work
well we don't know yet
but the early indications are that it
made some difference
or is likely to have a make a difference
now what makes that work i would say the
first thing that makes it work is that
it's coming from trump
and trump is in a protracted long-term
tariff battle with china
do you see how the tariff battle with
china
helps him on immigration
because
here here's something that nobody in
mexico believes are you ready for this
something that no one in mexico believes
that he wouldn't make good on the threat
nobody in mexico thinks he's bluffing
think about that
almost any other time you have a
situation like this if you don't do this
i'll do this
you at least think
maybe he's bluffing maybe we should test
it a little bit you know we could always
pull it back
if if it turns out he's not bluffing we
could always change your mind later but
let's push it because he's probably
bluffing
does it look like mexico
considered for half a second that he was
bluffing
nope
did it matter to mexico
that so many experts and economists
and and people even on the republican
side and people on the democrat side
didn't matter to mexico
that so much of the country was telling
trump don't do it don't do it it's bad
for our economy
did that matter
nope
think about that
imagine any other president
and imagine
that both sides of the aisle are telling
the president not to do it republicans
are telling him not to do it democrats
are telling him not to do it now replace
trump with obama
do you think
that mexico would say oh obama's
definitely going to put this
tariff on us even though
so many experts on both sides are
telling him not to do it they would say
no this sounds like a bluff
i don't think he can do this politically
now change that obama put in trump what
do they think
abso freaking lutely he's going to do it
he's going to do it and it doesn't
matter how many people tell him not to
do you know why
because he's right and it works
and if you don't make good on your
threats
you don't get anything
so he's definitely going to make good on
his threats
he will make good on his threats that's
what gives him currency that's what
gives him the ability to negotiate and
you see that so powerfully here with
mexico if it comes to a good solution or
an improvement we'll see
uh all right we got to talk about some
new nicknames here we've got uh
uh president trump is testing out
nervous nancy
for nancy pelosi
i have rated this among
among his very best
nervous nancy is up there with low
energy jeb as
just a home run
now i don't know if he'll keep it
because it depends if you know if the
public retweets it and stuff i'm sure
they're keeping an eye on how people
responding to it but let me tell you
how perfect this is and then i'm going
to compare it to something that's not
perfect so you can see the difference
nervous nancy
has a number of qualities number one and
this is his secret sauce
it's something that visually is
reinforcing
every time you see her you're gonna
wonder hey what's going on
is she old does she have a mental
problem is she drinking is she sick
or is she nervous
now had trump said i think she's
drinking where she's she's mentally
incompetent
people would say oh come on
come on that's that's not really an
evidence you know you could have your
suspicions but that's not fair
but when you say somebody's nervous
everybody's nervous
sometimes we're more nervous than other
times
but you can't really debunk it
because without getting inside her head
how in the world can you know if she's
she's nervous or not so it's brilliant
because it doesn't go too far
calling her a drunk or insane would go
too far
nervous is is well within his acceptable
range where people aren't going to say
we must impeach him for calling nancy
pelosi nervous
you know that so he's it's safe
but imagine how that gets in your head
this is the part people people don't get
when trump refers to
biden as sleepy
he's changing biden's behavior and he's
calling out something for the press to
look at
so the press is going to pay attention
to how hard joe biden is campaigning
and if it's not hard enough they're
going to call it out because the
president calls him sleepy
if joe biden responds to that by trying
to up his energy he's going to look like
a fake because if you put your energy
higher than your normal energy people
say what's wrong with you today it just
looks fake so he can't do that
and if he if he tries to put let's say
he adds more events or something he's
actually going to get tired because he's
pretty old
so trump is using um
sort of a
trash talk
psychology that you would use on a golf
course
i was imagining after after he came up
with uh nervous nancy i was imagining
how hard it would be to beat uh trump at
golf can you imagine trying to golf with
trump even if you were better than him a
little bit
you know you'd be talking in the golf
cart and he'd be saying stuff that just
gets in your head you know you'd be
driving in the golf cart and trump would
be like hey nice day you know he'd be
talking about different things nothing
and then he'd say hey notice i notice uh
your stroke's a little smoother than
normal
and and
the competitor thinks
my strokes a little smoother than normal
i haven't changed anything i wonder
what's
what makes my stroke look smoother well
he didn't insult me that's actually a
compliment isn't it i think my stroke is
and then by the time
that golfer
gets to the ball
he's barely going to be able to hit the
ball the ball the ball is going to go in
the trees because all the golfer is
thinking about is a stroke
now
if you're a golfer you already know this
right you don't comment on somebody's
form
during a match
you don't do that
right can can the golfers here
confirm i'm not much of a golfer but i
but can you confirm that the last thing
that would be fair game is to mention
anything about somebody's um technique
or how they're feeling or suppose you
said to your gulf say hey
what's matter today
and the golfer says what do you mean
what's the matter i'm just asking is
anything wrong with you today you look a
little
look a little off today
what do you mean what do you mean i look
a little off
that would be enough
to completely ruin somebody's game it's
the same technique that trump is taking
to politics you know the same way that
he's brought um entertainment and
reality tv
skills
which he's weaponized really effectively
he's bringing sort of sports trash
talking skills into politics like you've
never seen them
so imagine you're
imagine you're nervous uh nervous nancy
the next time you're speaking in public
what's it going to do to you to know
that half of the country
is watching you to see if you're nervous
think about it
if you have if you haven't thought of it
this way
you're missing the best part the best
part is what it does to her future
behavior because you can't ignore that
it's it's impossible to ignore
the next time she's in public
she's going to be speaking
and because there have been all these
clips of her um
changing
changing her word or hesitating and
pausing
before you had seen it framed as nervous
maybe it didn't mean as much to you if
if nobody had been talking about you
know there's something wrong with her
speech because that
fake video this slowed down her speech
and made it look like she was slurring
if none of that had ever happened
you wouldn't even notice
because people who speak without a
script in public
often need to pause change a word
misspeak you know stammer
completely normal and certainly
completely normal over a certain age
but trump just got in her head so hard
that the first time she
she gets flustered misses a word has to
correct the first time she has a an
imperfection
she's going to be thinking about the
things she has to fix
thinking about what she wants to say
thinking about how to say it and
thinking about how to make it look not
nervous
how is that going to look
let's just say her golf game is not
going to be on point
and that
is the genius of what he does now let's
compare that
let's compare it to um
to don junior's uh
tweet i think it was yesterday or today
in which he was referring to joe biden
changing his stance about the funding of
abortion so i guess uh biden had been at
one point
supportive of the idea that the federal
government should not fund abortions he
now changed that to
uh yes yes the government should should
be funding abortions
now don jr tweeted with the hashtag
floppy joe
now on a huber level
floppy joe
is tremendous it's just got the right
words the right letters it you know
it rhymes with sloppy joe
that makes you laugh
um and and sure enough joe biden
flip-flops so it fits so
it's kind of great right floppy joe
just as good as nervous nancy right
no
not even close
floppy joe is very funny and in the
context of a tweet it's actually great
so as a humorous tweet that gets your
attention gets a lot of retweets and
stuff that's great
so
don jr
came up with a great nickname for
getting more tweets
but you notice that floppy joe
isn't really
gonna change
biden's behavior
i mean because what the what's the worst
thing that could happen is he'll he'll
stop changing his mind
i don't know if that even hurts him so
floppy joe doesn't have the weaponized
quality that's actually going to change
how you see joe biden forever
it just doesn't change how you see him
but
low energy jeb
oh that definitely changed how you see
them
crooked hillary
well that probably heightened whatever
suspicions you already had for sure
nervous nancy oh that absolutely changes
how you see her floppy joe
brilliantly funny
a great tweet
probably doesn't change anything in the
in the election
so there's there's the difference so
it's easy it would be easy for you to
say if you if you're
sort of not reversed in the persuasion
of it
that those are both good because they
both make you laugh
but one of them is weaponized and one of
them's
just good
good good tweeting
all right um i think that hit all of the
points that i wanted to hit today
and so
i ask you is there anything else that
you'd like oh i have one question for
you i'm gonna put this out here i have a
book that was my sequel to god's debris
wrote years ago called the religion war
and i've never
created the um
i've never created the audiobook for it
uh would any of you be interested in
hearing the audiobook
in chapter forum on youtube in other
words i could just read my own book
on youtube
and then you can listen to it as a
podcast or you can listen to it as a
now i'd probably
probably
i don't know if i would break it up into
separate
chapters or what i do i might do that
um
okay a lot of people are saying yes i
mean why wouldn't you it's free you can
always you can listen or not listen
all right i'll think about doing that
i'll find the right time to do that and
then we'll go
um
question
i have improved my lighting setup in
this room is my lighting better today
than usual
usually i can't tell until the re the
replay so here's the question is my
lighting good today
oh i don't know which one what you're
saying yes do now
um
can somebody tell me if my lighting's
good i'm waiting for some of the
comments to go through
all right well i'll look at them later
um
good i'm glad so many of you are saying
yes to that well then i'll do that
isn't this the beauty of the the medium
you you can watch in real time
as you're influencing me and then i do
something on social media and that
influences other people so you're
actually
i hope you feel this like in real time
you're influencing me and then i'll do
things that will influence other people
this is this is real and it's powerful
and
it's fun
somebody says too bright i think you
might be right i'll i won't know until i
see the ultimate replay all right
enough for now i will talk to you
later
