good morning everybody
and welcome
to another highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with scott adams and
i think if you scoured the entire planet
all four corners of the circle
you would find nothing better than this
nothing no no you think that the birth
of your child was good that was nothing
compared to what you're going to see
this morning
and if you'd like to take it up to
another level i'm talking better than
twins
well all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker jealous a steiner
canteen juggerflask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now
go
oh
yeah
oh that was good
yeah whoa that was good
wow
i feel i'm growing muscles
i'm not even working out that's that's
how good that coffee was
well did you ever wonder what it was
worth to not be a hypocrite
did you ever wonder the economic value
of being consistent in your opinion well
i've learned the actual economic value
of that
twenty dollars
i won twenty dollars yesterday
for being consistent in my opinion
i know i know pat on the back
here's what happened
um i was on twitter as i often am and
must have said something about
those mar-a-lago documents not being
terribly important
to anything
because it to me the whole mar-a-lago
thing looks like fake news
that you know once we boil it down to
what was happening it's going to be sort
of
sort of about documents
i just don't feel it's ever going to be
important we're just going to treat it
like it's important until we finally all
just give up and say yeah that really
was nothing
so i must have said something that
trivialized the mar-a-lago stuff and
then i i got tweeted at by
twitter user jc adolfson and he said and
he said to me
he said to me
i bet twenty dollars if i scrolled back
five years
i would find tweets about emails
and how
i'm talking about hillary clinton i
would find tweets about emails and how
she should be in prison for mishandling
classified documents
that's right
uh jc adelson thinks if he goes back
through my twitter account
he's going to find an inconsistency
where i thought hillary clinton should
be locked up
but i think trump should be just allowed
to do whatever he wants with documents
that's what jc said
he was going to bet twenty dollars that
i had an inconsistent opinion
to which i said bet accepted
because i said her emails were trivial
how many of you were angry at me at the
time when i kept saying that hillary's
emails were no big deal and she
shouldn't go to jail for that
see what happened
a few years pass
and i'm just about the only person who
can tell you that
the mar-a-lago documents are not
important because who is the only
consistent person in the entire world
me
me
i know you're still mad at me
somebody says they're still mad at me
for
but whether you think that both of them
are important or neither them or if you
want to make the argument
scott these are completely different
situations
i know they're different situations i
know
i get that
i get that one of them could be bad and
one of them could be good in a
theoretical sense
but
i believe that both of them are in the
category of paperwork
and while i get that there have to be
laws
about handling of secure stuff i get
that
and i get that laws were broken
and i get that nobody's above the law
but i also like
my own self-interest
and my self-interest is
that we don't have leaders in the
country locking each other up
like the the winner doesn't get to lock
up the loser right i'm not going to live
in that country
seriously
if the loser starts getting locked up
i i'm out of here like i'm out
of that country
so no
do i care if hillary broke some laws
with her emails
not really
not really
because it was probably technical laws
you know now what she was doing might
have been important to me like what she
was actually transacting but it mattered
but i don't know what that is
but do i care that her email was
unsecure
a little bit
not enough she should go to jail for it
do i do i care that
trump may or may not be mishandling some
documents a little bit
a little bit
do i think you should go to jail for it
no
i mean i don't know what the real
situation is maybe someday we'll find
out but we should be sending our leaders
to jail for stuff
this small
this small
let me go further
i think our leader should be above the
law
there i said it
because i don't want somebody coming in
and say scott
you why do you think some people should
be above the law no i do think some
people should be above the law
these smaller laws
the smaller ones
do you think the president should go to
jail for littering
well you don't go to jail for littering
but you know what i mean right
it's simply not in the best interest of
citizens
that we're using the legal system to
beat up our our leaders
we we should not give them that weapon
we should
disarm our leaders
so that they're not fighting again about
let them take care of global
stuff
let them take care of the economy and
immigration and you know supply chains
go work on that stuff
but if you want to put any of them in
jail for their emails or their
you know their their paperwork
no i'm not on board with that
i let both sides get away with that
stuff unfortunately
i mean you should discourage it
maybe after they're out of office you do
something about it that would be
different
but
nixon
i don't know
i think breaking and entering is not
exactly a small small crime
i think breaking and entering is
that's a different level
all right
um it turns out that young people are
being more pro-nuclear than
um maybe ever as far as i know
so what do you think has caused
young people to become
uh the most pro-nuclear they've been
they're they're not they're not
pro-nuclear by a huge majority it's just
compared to where they used to be
there's a very dramatic movement what do
you think it is
what do you think caused youth
to be pro-nuclear
you know i'd love to tell you that it's
adults
doing
you know maybe some education i'd love
to tell you it was michael
schellenberger because he's you know
superstar and that i'd love to tell you
is mark schneider another superstar of
you know nuclear
let's say
um education for the public
and i'd love to tell you that i'd helped
in some way because i like boosting both
of those
people but i don't think young people
are paying attention to any of us
do you
i can't imagine
anybody under
20
could name any of those three people or
have seen any of our tweets
so whatever is happening
um
whatever is happening i think it's
happening on its own
i think with adults and maybe with
leaders
we we move the needle
collectively
but
i think here's my theory on the young
you ready for it
the young disagree
with whatever is the
you know the the mainstream opinion
so i feel like it has more to do with
the fact that adults
say nuclear is scary
if all the adults that said nuclear was
safe
maybe that maybe the young would be on
the other side of that
so there's a little bit there's a little
bit automatic about young people
disagreeing with the status quo
i feel like there's a little bit of
automatic in there now secondly it could
be that they've
some of them
have figured out there's no other way to
save the planet if they think the planet
is going to you know
go up in flames
so it could be some of them said okay
whatever whatever risk is involved
it can't be as bad as the whole planet
going up
it could be that but
um it's an unknown i just read an
article on it where the article said
nobody knows why that's changing
well dr drew has been blocked on youtube
again
apparently he was planning to livestream
a dr
robert malone interview
dr robert malone as you know is a rogue
doctor a rogue doctor
meaning that he has some
non-traditional views on
the dangers of
the vaccines and some other pandemic
related topics
and
so we now live in a world where a doctor
can't talk to a doctor in front of you
that's real
now if you told me that
youtube had blocked let's say uh joe
rogan
from talking to robert malone or tim
poole or name whoever you want to name
as a famous blogger
i would say to myself okay
maybe i don't agree with that but at
least i see what they're trying to do
right
what they're trying to do is make sure
that you don't have a doctor
fooling some non-doctor with a bunch of
and then the viewers can't tell that the
doctor is full of
right
but that's not really the same as a
doctor talking to a doctor
that's got to be different
all right
if you have two doctors talking on a
topic in which both of them have been
quite immersed for a long time
that has to be something the public can
see
so youtube if you're listening to me and
any of you have anything to do with who
gets banned on the dr drew
channels
you need to make an exception for a
doctor on doctor conversation
i believe you should also let all of the
other conversations in
under free speech blah blah blah
but if you're stopping a doctor from
talking to a doctor
about the most relevant medical question
of our time
you've really
you've really gone off the rails
there's no way i can possibly support
that
not not even a little bit
so i would say to youtube
um just keep in mind this is doctor on
doctor talking
if you're blocking that you've gone
completely
into a territory that has no backing at
all
right
no backing at all
uh you've been off the rails since they
fired james
damore
oh they've been off the rails not me
all right
um
so we'll see what happens there
the funniest story of the day
is there's a trending uh hashtag on
twitter to boycott cnn
do you know why
there's a move by cnn's own viewers
do boycott cnn
yeah
so all right so let's let's just go
through all the ways this is funny
number one
they want to stage a boycott
for a product that nobody wants already
cnn's ratings are so low that i don't
know if you'd even notice a boycott
would anybody even notice
all right so that's the first funny
thing
is that they're talking about boycotting
something as you know almost no no
audience i'm exaggerating a little bit
but it's a small audience compared to a
lot of things on television
the
the next thing is that
you have to go follow the hashtag
so go to twitter if you have a twitter
account follow the boycott cnn
and you have to see the comments
from the angry angry
audience that is being abandoned by them
because they're making a move toward not
being biased
that's what cnn is doing
so cnn has has dared to say out loud
that they don't want to publish biased
news anymore they want to want to do
something that's more realistic and
close to the middle
they're saying out loud as specifically
as they can
we want to be more fair and accurate in
our news
and what did their audience say their
audience said
no
no
we don't want that fair and accurate
stuff down the middle
we we don't want that
now
how funny is it
that
they're literally boycotting fairness
and accuracy
and that their audience
was apparently always in on the in on
the joke
and the joke was that cnn wasn't trying
to do real news
that's how i hear it i hear that their
news that their audience understood
that they weren't a real news
organization it was about team building
or something
and that they liked that they liked the
team building they liked the
team play element of it and as soon as
they said they were going to be real
news and they allowed on some
republicans i guess this week
well i say allowed on i'm sure they were
always invited but for whatever reason
they're going on now
and
and so they're watching their own
audience go nuts
because the audience might be exposed to
real news for the first time
is very funny
right it's very funny there's not much
you can say about it you just describe
it
and then it's just funny
all right
so here's an example
so here this is a story on cnn's
website and you tell me if you would
have seen this story a year ago
because i think this is an example of
cnn trying to actually find a reasonable
center
now by the way if they continue on this
path
cnn does of of looking for the center i
think i'm going to be on their side
i i think i'm going to help them like
you know talk them up a little bit
because i don't think it's going to work
i i think financially they're going to
go down in flames because i don't know
that their audience wants real news
and i don't know that you know fox
viewers are going to tune in
so i don't think their strategy is a
good one but i do support it for the
benefit of the world
so for the benefit of the world
you know maybe i'll give them a little
boost
we'll see what they can do but here's an
example
you tell me if you think this story
would have been on cnn a major story
right this is not small this is a major
story on cnn
and it says there's a big change in
who's coming to the u.s mexico border
a large number of migrants from mexico
and the northern triangle
are still making the journey but the
number of migrants from other countries
represented and they show graph has
hugely increased
so it's a story about the border
situation worsening
and it's worse in a way that clearly is
um
some exposure to you know terrorism and
risk
because the people coming across the
border are no longer just central
america and mexico they're from
everywhere
right yeah we got cubans and everything
else
so
do you think the cnn would have told a
story about
the mexican border crisis is not only
bad
but it's worse than you think it's
actually a story about the border
situation being
worse than you thought
that's new right
can you already see the editorial change
to me it looks like there's a shift
now
uh
i saw some people attacking jake tapper
for having some republicans on on the
program and not pushing back hard enough
well i'm gonna
you know i'm gonna
support jake tapper here
if he had republicans on that's a big
step in the right direction
and
i i'm sure he's invited them on before i
just don't know why it's happening now
and didn't happen before
but how much pushback do you really
expect on a you know like a four-minute
hit
there's just not a lot of pushback you
can do so i don't know if you push back
enough or not but yeah there's a limit
to how much you can push back in four
minutes
here's a question for you
how many ways could trump
win the presidency back
i feel like there are lots of ways for
him to do it
but i don't think he's necessarily going
to take the way that
would be easiest
now these are mostly just funny
here's one way trump could win the
presidency never talk in public
while he's running for public while he's
running for president just not
don't do any interviews
just don't do any
just do the biden haydn biden strategy
and actually tell the world he's doing
it
just say you know you know exactly what
i'll do because i you watched it before
i'm going to do more of that
if you want more of that
i'm your person but you don't need me to
describe it because you know what it is
you know what you're getting
so you know what you're getting so i'm
not i'm not going to say anything that
will cause any fake news to come after
me
taking things out of context you know
exactly what you're getting
i'll be here
let me know
now
the news would go crazy because they
wouldn't have you know trump to
entertain them and there's no way that
trump would do this by the way i think
that's so counter to everything in his
personality that there's no chance it
would happen
but would it work
would it work
i think the only thing that could keep
trump from winning
is something trump said
so if he doesn't say something
you know that they can take out of
context
it probably just waltzes right into the
office
all right here's another one
you know how trump was good at
you know grabbing the gun from the
opponent and turning it around
so you know he turned fake news into a
weapon against against him when it was
initially used against him
here's one he could turn around imagine
instead of make america great again
trump ran on an anti-fascism platform
anti-fascism platform
and just made everything about that
say fascism is when the government tries
to control industry and takes your
rights away here are all the ways the
democrats are controlling industry or
trying to with their regulations and
their taxes and their esg
and here all the ways the republicans
are trying to keep you free
now
what would happen if he ran on an
anti-fascism platform
what would the democrats say they'd say
no
you're the fascist
republicans are the fascists right
that's what they say now that would be
predictable
now what would happen next
you know what would happen next
you'd have to talk about what a
fascist is
you couldn't avoid it
if he made it his platform
you'd have to talk about it every day
and if you talked about it every day why
would you learn
who's more fascist
the people who are putting restrictions
on you were the ones who are taking them
off you
now the the glaring exception is
abortion
the left is going to say no you fascists
are taking away our right of abortion
which is true in a way
but at the same time that's a special
case right because you know the
republicans are saying we're stopping
murder
you know that's not exactly what
motivates fascists
fascists are not motivated by stopping
murder
as they see it right that's not my
opinion that's
the opinion of people
right so i think you i think you could
easily carve out the abortion one say no
no no that's that's about
uh people's
genuine here's the way i'd say
if i were arguing
against abortion
i would give the other side
the complete
respect
that they deserve
and i think they deserve more respect
than you do perhaps i would actually
make their argument for them
i'd say here's what they say
and i gotta admit
there's something to that
but on the other side you know my team
if this is your team
um so one could say my team believes
that this is murder and that all life is
sacred and we're gonna we're gonna push
that
i think you could you can make that
message real easily but i think you have
to respect the other side
and say i understand why somebody would
want this
would want this right
i understand why somebody would do it
you know times are tough things are
desperate
people have different opinions about
what is right what is wrong i get that
but we're on the side of
life is sacred and i think you'll
appreciate that in the long run
so i think you i think you could easily
make an anti-fascism argument
and not worry about the abortion part
you you could argue that away pretty
easily but you have to you have to give
some respect to the other team
to make a good argument nobody nobody
accepts an argument where you only say
your side
nobody because if you only say your side
of the argument and you don't
acknowledge there's some point to the
other side
everybody just says oh partisan they're
not even trying
all right you got to show the other side
all right
uh here's another way that trump could
win
this would be his slogan
you ready for this
this one's gonna this one will just stop
you in your tracks
this would be a trump slogan that would
guarantee his election
make europe warm again
make europe
warm again
and we're done
and
we're done
right
he he could just put out the bumper
sticker and then go back in the basement
he would never have to do an interview
again
make europe warm again
there's nothing else you have to add to
that argument
am i right
the the entire argument is in
four words
there's nothing else you have to add to
that
that biden was such a disaster
that europe is going to freeze and
starve
at least to some degree
and you know it might be even worse not
might it's going to be even worse in the
you know in the bangladesh
type places
there's
you could just be done
make europe warm again
and walk away
because if you don't want europe to be
warm again
you're not really america are you
because here's my here's my take on this
a lot of these questions are about what
you want to do
like what's the best path
this isn't one of them
it isn't one of them
what is this
the question of whether we're you know
stepping up to help europe enough
is that a question about the the best
strategy
it isn't
is it about the best path is about who's
predicting what is it about follow the
money
no
it's not any of that
it's about one thing
who is america
this this is a
this is an identity question
who are we
because we're a little bit confused
right now aren't we like america is not
quite sure who it is
we're sort of in a little transitionary
period
we're a little you know at each other's
throats at the moment
but if we stand here and watch
europe starve
and freeze
whatever we are
is not what we used to be
who would agree with me on that if we
let this happen the way it looks like
it's going to happen
i don't see anything that would change
it
can we say that we're great
i don't think so
like i'm so pro-american it's disgusting
but if we let this happen we're not
great
we're not great
let's just stop pretending
you know maybe you should be make
america adequate again
make america not suck again
like we're so far from greatness
if we can't solve this problem because
here's the problem it's a solvable
problem
if it were
unsolvable
or if we had done everything we could
i say well you've done everything you
could
but
i'm not happy i'm not happy rebranding
america to pathetic
right there are enough people who think
that about america already but we don't
have to brand ourselves pathetic
and that's what we're doing
you know it's bad enough if somebody
else has a bad opinion about your
country but we're doing this to
ourselves
we're making a conscious
considered
um
we've got plenty of time
like nobody's rushed
and we've decided that the what america
wants to be
at least if we continue on this path
is we want to be a bunch of useless
that that's like an actual decision
you know in effect it's a decision
i tell you who i'd like to be
here's who i would like to be
i'd like to be somebody who pulled down
all the stops to help europe
that's who i'd like to be
and
if we don't have an administration that
can help me be who i want to be i can't
really support that
can't support that at all
yeah act like an ally
and and let me say this if we let europe
starve and freeze
don't ask him from help if we ever need
any
if the united states ever needs some
help
i wouldn't i wouldn't ask europe
because if they say no i'd say okay i
get that i get that so we're going to
throw away uh 200 years of
uh
insanely important history
where if you need help we're going to be
there
we're going to throw that out the
 window that's like the most
valuable thing the country has
but what does america have that's more
valuable
than its allies
not much
right
um did you know that elon musk said he
was going to give up all his you know
major physical possessions so i guess he
got rid of all his real estate he
doesn't own a house
uh
i'm guessing he doesn't own a
car which is funny
because he owns a you know a car company
but i'll bet he doesn't own a car
probably just has one that the company
owns or he drives or something or
somebody drives them he probably doesn't
drive too much
and do you remember uh a lot of you were
worried because it was a klaus schwab or
somebody
predicted about the future that you will
own nothing and love it
you'll own nothing and love it and then
people interpreted that as
socialism
and when i heard it i thought no no no
owning things is a gigantic headache
now
if you're not in this situation you may
not have experienced this but i'm sort
of in the not sort of i'm in a situation
where i could own more than one home
if i wanted to
do you know how much trouble only one
home is
oh my god
it's like a full-time job
only two homes would just double my work
and i could you know go stay at a hotel
if i want to travel
owning possessions
is is just a burden
do you know why i like going on vacation
does anybody know why i like going on
vacation
to get away from my possessions
true story
when i go on vacation
it's not because i like the destination
although i often like the destination is
because i have to escape my possessions
they're too needy
and my dog
i have to get away from my dog
my dog is a continuous burden on my life
i love her madly you know when she
passes i'll be
destroyed
but nonetheless
she she lowers the quality of my life by
40
at least
i mean it's just terrible living in a
house with a dog if you're the only one
if you have other people in the house
they can you know take some of the dog
energy but if there's only one person in
the house with a dog it's just it's just
it's just the shits
it really is terrible to live with a dog
and and i love my dog
i love her
you just can't live and work in a house
that has a dog because the trouble is i
have too much empathy
i don't know what your dog looks like
but every time i want to do something my
dog runs over doesn't does this
are you going to do something for me
right now are we going outside
no oh
oh
oh
oh
we're not going outside right now
because i really really want to go
outside right now not in five minutes
right now
that's my dog every minute of my life
she either needs a treat
right now
or she's got to go through a doorway or
someplace else
right now
and she can't wait
so every minute of my day i'm
disappointing my dog who i love more
than you know
anybody basically
and so i'm just making the thing i love
the most
i'm treating her like a prisoner because
she's not free
i'm literally her jailer
and i feel like her jailer every day
every moment i'm not playing with her
she's in jail
she literally has to just sit on the
couch for like eight hours
waiting for me to have some free time to
do something with her for like 10
minutes
and then she'll go like what
wait in jail another six hours until
something comes up
it's horrible having a dog
i i so don't recommend it
anyway
but i love dogs physical possessions
yeah you don't get involved
um so musk
twitter whistleblower
uh so the whistleblowers is uh peter
he's a
he was the head of security for uh
twitter
how much do you imagine the head of the
ex ahead of security for twitter knows
about the
the internal workings
wouldn't wouldn't you love to interview
that
guy because didn't he say that he thinks
there might be some foreign agents in
the company
wouldn't you like to know a little bit
more about that
doggie daycare
but doggy daycare recruit requires me to
drive the dog there and then pick it up
and drive it back
so that's like an hour and a half out of
my day
there's just nothing that's just an
unsolvable problem
basically um
anyway we'll find out more about twitter
um how many of you think there's going
to be some kind of a civil war in the
united states
don't answer there's not going to be a
civil war
again
all the people talking about civil war
are just addicted to social media
it there's nobody who doesn't use social
media who thinks there's going to be a
civil war
not even close
not even close
if january 6 didn't cause uh republicans
to even arm themselves i mean i i
suppose they had some weapons nearby but
they didn't use weapons on january 6.
and that was at least in their minds
that was a pretty big deal
now
whether or not they were right or wrong
is a separate question but in their
minds that was a big deal they thought
the
the republic had been subverted
and even that didn't cause violence and
it only caused a little bit of
you know well caused some violence but
it caused you know action only in one
place it didn't even spread around the
country
so
we we need to get rid of the silliness
that that's not serious
the whole civil war thing
right that's not serious and you you
need to
start treating it as not serious
you spoiled your dog yeah
i didn't spoil my dog but the dog gets
boiled
all right
um
did you know there's an old interview
that i saw on twitter today
in which uh biden however many years ago
talking about the war in iraq
and i guess he supported the war in iraq
and
he actually said out loud
that the story about saddam maybe having
nuclear weapons
was intentionally a lie
by the government
and that they all knew it
like the senators all knew it that it
was a lie and the reason that they went
along with it
and biden says this directly that he
went along with the lie
because he thought that would sell
better better to the public
than the truth
i'm not making this up he actually said
that
he said that the government lied to the
people about nuclear weapons or a
nuclear program in iraq they knew they
were lying and it's because the real
story wouldn't sell as well
he said that out loud
in direct in direct language i mean i'm
paraphrasing but he was just as direct
now he did argue
that the quote totality of the situation
was sufficient for the war
so his argument is yes uh
saddam had weapons of mass destruction
chemical wear
chemical weapons
and
while we could not prove he had nuclear
it it was better to sell that to the
public
now
did saddam have nuclear have chemical
weapons
you all watch the news
and i'm sure there's no fake news
did saddam have chemical weapons
go
some say no some say yes
i see mostly yeses but a lot of knows
yes no yes now how could you all have
watched the same news
and you have different opinions about
whether he had chemical weapons how is
that possible
how could you all have been watching the
same story this is about
a major major war
and you don't know the basics about it
the basics
did he have chemical weapons
well here's the weird thing about
being on twitter
so i tweet about this morning
and then i get
i get tweeted at by
joshua hartley who's on twitter and
just take a moment
to to consider how awesome this is
what i'm gonna tell you
how awesome is it that we're wondering
about okay well what really did happen
in iraq and within minutes i get a tweet
from joshua hartley who says and i quote
my platoon guarded the main bunker
storing chemical weapons in 2008.
what
what
am i actually talking to the person who
guarded the weapons of mass destruction
so i don't have to wonder if they were
real
i'm talking to the guy who stood there
next to him
right so he goes on he goes
no nuclear so he confirms no nuclear
but yes wmds saddam hadn't destroyed
them as agreed
okay
now to go back to biden's point
if saddam said he would destroy them but
but we knew he hadn't
would that be cause for war
they are weapons of mass destruction
uh you could argue whether that's cause
for war but
i don't think you can argue that they
had them
and they didn't destroy them
now
is the fact that they didn't destroy
them
evidence that saddam was planning to
maybe use them
yes or no
is the fact that saddam did not destroy
them because that seems to be proven
is that proof
that he planned to you know have them
available to use
do you know how the united states
destroyed those chemical weapons finally
does anybody know that story
so they were there
how did we destroy them
does anybody know no we need to use them
uh
burn them
they tried the blowing them up uh was
too risky
no i'm not
i'm going to tell you the answer
uh we guarded them until we left and
then isis took them
we guarded them until
we stopped guarding it and then isis
took it
that actually happened
i think i mean that's the story i'm
getting
now i
now here's the second part of the story
do you know why the united states didn't
destroy them
we didn't know how
the united states
did not know how
to do the thing that we told saddam he
had to do or we'd destroy his country
let me say it again the united states
did not know and still does not know
how to destroy those
chemical weapons without making things
worse
but we asked saddam to do it
and when he didn't do the thing that's
impossible
we destroyed his country and killed him
because he didn't do the thing we asked
him to do
that we know wasn't a fact impossible
that really happened
amazing now the other thing is we don't
know how
how useful these uh chemical weapons
were because they were old and degraded
now the reason that
they couldn't tell you oh we found all
these weapons of mass destruction
and give you full details about it was
because
they were old
and it did not support the narrative to
say the only weapons of mass destruction
were old and probably didn't work
so they had to change the narrative to
what would sell
so now that you know that your
government admits lying to you to get
you into a war
would you believe anything they ever
tell you again
not if you're smart
not if you're smart
um
so further uh this is joshua hartley who
had guarded the weapons mass destruction
i'll let you know what the rest of his
tweets here he said i was able to
discuss this with members of the bush
administration after the war
and the lies around this are far deeper
and more complex than can be discerned
by
publicly available information and he
said i could dm him if i wanted to know
more
but this is what he's saying publicly on
twitter
um
and he he said that
some of the
wmds probably were usable but many of
them were degraded
yeah so apparently they were guarding a
facility that the politicians wanted you
believe didn't exist
now the new york times was reporting
about the old chemical weapons that were
found
um
and they i think the new york times
actually reported that
um
the story was
being managed by the government because
otherwise you couldn't sell it to the
public
wow
wow because they were the weapons they
found were too old to make their case
all right
so
how
how much of a lie
yeah how much of a yeah we know about
tonkin duncan bay so the the government
has lied to get us into war before we
know that that's that's a matter of
historical record
um
but you wonder how far the gas lighting
can go
and here's an example of how far the gas
lighting can go
so i guess uh steve ducey asked um
jean-pierre the
the spokesperson for biden
uh ducey said
somebody unvaccinated comes over on a
plane talking about immigration
you say that's not okay
somebody walks into texas or arizona
unvaccinated they're allowed to stay
and john pierre says that's not how it
works
it's not like someone walks over
what
it's not like somebody just walks over
the border
turn on the television
you can see live streams of people
walking over the border just walking
over
you know being guided by the coyotes
it's all over the news all you have to
do is turn it on you can see the lines
of people coming over
and then ducey says that's exactly what
is happening
it's not like someone just walks over
uh that's exactly what's happening
so then you know the spokesperson went
on and just sort of changed the subject
to all the awesome things they're doing
to control the border
but
now i get that her job is to you know
just support the administration but
this is such a transparent lie
like are they supposed to lie to you
that directly
because it would be one thing to say oh
i think the inflation is transitory
which they probably didn't think but at
least they had you know something like
an argument say well these things are
temporary at least at least there was
something to it right
but this is just a direct lie that your
eyes are not working oh yeah your eye
you see people coming across that border
right now on a live stream
but that's not happening the thing you
see with your own eyes right now that's
not happening at all
so
uh
that's it's just mind-boggling
that the government can lie to you that
directly
yeah it'd be one thing if you couldn't
tell it was a lie
oh my god
um
who's winning in ukraine
russia or ukraine
what do you think who's winning
have you noticed that the news
uh has basically just turned that back
into fog
so when the whole thing started there
was you know fog of war he didn't know
what was going on and then it seemed
like things cleared up a little bit it
looked like there was going to be some
kind of stability where russia was going
to maybe keep the parts that they'd
occupied
and then maybe ukraine would keep the
rest and you know maybe that would be
how things shake out in the end
but
uh ukraine says it's doing a
counter-offensive in kirsan
wherever that is
and
if you look at social media
people are absolutely convinced that
they know which side is winning and why
and they just have completely different
takes
so there are a bunch of accounts that
say
russia is definitely winning and it's
over but honestly they all look like
russian
agents to me
do you see that
it looks to me like russia itself has so
infiltrated
twitter
that whenever you say ukraine is doing
anything right
it looks i can't tell i'm not positive
but it looks like a bunch of russian
accounts come over
and start slapping you down right away
have you noticed that
is it my imagination because they look
like they're obviously not real people
they look like they're obviously russian
operatives of some kind
oh you see the opposite somebody says
you see more ukrainian operatives coming
in but you see both right
the the ukrainian ones i think in many
cases are just americans who are
pro-ukraine
but the pro-russian ones they all look
like they're
in some kind of bot
i farm
know it's hard to know it you know
because confirmation bias is so strong
but here's things that uh among the
things that you hear there's a curse on
counter-offensive that's already broken
through the russian lines
or not or nothing like that's happening
that's possible
or russia has complete air superiority
or not because the ukrainians do have
anti-aircraft that's working
the supply lines are cut for the russian
occupiers or not because they have a
land bridge to anything they want
so basically everything that we know
about the war
has a or not
they have to end to it because i don't
think we have any information that's
useful
i'll tell you what i predict and by the
way
so being the only person i know of i
don't know if anybody else predicts this
at the beginning i said that
ukraine would not easily fall to russia
because ukraine would have advanced
weaponry
so part of ukraine maybe the most
strategic part is occupied
but most of ukraine looks like it's not
under immediate threat
so was my prediction the best
of the entire war
i would say yes
i would say although i was not
completely right
i was the closest right by far
than
well you're saying i'm wrong but give me
a reason
is it true or false that ukraine still
exists as a country
true or false
because the experts said that by now
they would not exist as a country i said
they would
how am i wrong
yes they'll
exist as a country
yes i'm right or no they will already be
conquered by russia
where everybody on set
and you still think i'm wrong
what's the argument for that
now
of course people keep saying to me but
you're just a cartoonist so get out of
this military stuff to which i say you
know you're right i don't have any
military
knowledge or background at all
but i was the only one who was right
about ukraine
militarily
that's just a fact
i also had known no expertise in
politics when i predicted that trump
would win the first time
there are some things that i'm not sure
you need to be an expert to predict
because they're they're macro
variables that are so important and the
macro variable i think
is that nobody could ever conquer a
modern country with modern weapons it's
just not a thing anymore
so that was my thinking that that the
big picture of modern modern weaponry
was being ignored
so
i think
there's a non-zero chance that ukraine
is going to degrade the occupation
to the point where it won't make sense
for russia to stay they might stay
anyway because you know they don't want
to look like they retreated but i've got
a feeling that ukraine can degrade
the military assets in the occupied
countries just forever they'll just keep
lobbing artillery and drones and
missiles there until there's nothing
left
whereas
given that russia is not trying to
conquer the rest of ukraine
they're just you know fighting probably
the military that's closest to the
fighting there
i feel like that gives ukraine an
advantage
now not an advantage that i think they
will kick russia out of that territory
so let me be clear i'm not predicting
i'm not
that ukraine will recapture the
territory i think that would be a lot to
expect
but i do think that ukraine is just
going to pound it down until nobody
wants to live there including the
citizens
i think that's going to happen i think
he'll just become unlivable at some
point probably already is
all right that's my
prediction um
so we're watching biden destroying
europe and much of the world
and i saw an interesting
tweet
by nan hayworth she said
follow the money
and
i thought that's interesting
because it's a little confusing about
why the biden administration is acting
exactly the way they are
with
the ukraine situation and the only way i
could understand it is
if there's somehow money involved
and i guess you could say that maybe
the biden administration has to help
ukraine because ukraine knows too much
about the biden administration
i believe we're being blackmailed what
do you think
i believe the united states government
biden is being blackmailed by zolensky
either directly or indirectly that
doesn't mean he actually said directly
we will do this but i feel as if biden
knows that if ukraine goes under so does
he
so i feel like we're fighting biden's
war this is it looks like hunter's war
basically
i think hunter got us into a war
i think hunter is going to be the cause
of starvation in europe
is that is that too far
i believe hunter's addiction
is actually going to destroy europe
so you don't think addiction is a
problem there's one guy who was addicted
that probably will destroy europe
change the entire global security issue
for i don't know decades or 100 years
that's what it looks like to me looks
like one guy was addicted and his
addiction caused him to have to have a
lot of money
and if you're addicted you can't not
have a lot of money
and the only way to get it fast maybe
the amount he needed was to do whatever
he did that might bend a little sketchy
so
yeah i mean one addict
probably destroyed europe
you know you don't think one person can
make a difference in this world
well
he's one person
and i think he destroyed europe
so there's that
all right ladies and gentlemen i believe
that concludes
my prepared remarks
and so
that brings us to what is it you want me
to say that i didn't say
anything i missed
parmesan patriots
um
ukraine and russia have our number maybe
where are the aliens hiding
uh
yeah maybe peter i don't know
hunter's addiction
was caused due to the inability to
manage the anxiety of running the
corrupt family business
no you're not the only one
oh i haven't heard about gavis mcginnis
or gavin mcginnis i haven't heard
anything about that story
did you ever watch sam harris's
clarification i did not
um
by the way there's a movie
coming out soon um
larry larry elders it's a
uh uncle tom two
uncle tom two
and i just started watching it and it's
it's kind of mind blowing i got i gotta
admit
like
the the first ten minutes of it well
i've watched more than that maybe the
first
half hour or so
it's mind-blowing
i'm not going to tell you why yet i'll
give you a full review when i'm done
but it's it's mind blowing
yeah i
it'll you up
like if you watch it your your entire
sense of what is happening
or what has happened
specifically about you know black
americans
it completely will change your mind
about what's happening
so
now i'm not going to say i agree with
all of the
uh editorial
that's different
right it has an editorial edge and a
specific
uh let's say a specific set of um
actions
that would make things better
and i'm not going to say i back all of
that
primarily because it's a religious
sort of a religious based argument and
since i'm not a believer i
you know if it works it works so if it's
good for black americans it's you know
good for me
so i'm not going to be against it i just
can't make the argument
um
so it's called uncle tom ii so it's the
sequel to his first film uncle tom
uh
be a believer
i did not get a guitar yet it'll be my
christmas present to
myself will the fbi target you for
speaking out against government lies
what do you think
what do you think
you know i thought about
maybe using my man cave to invite
people in for interviews and i thought
that if i brought people into my home
to interview them i would have to warn
them that i that their communication is
not secure
in my own home
because i thought to myself who's the
most important person i could get you
know maybe a politician or something it
would come to my house because that's
sort of a big ask i'm not exactly close
to a major metropolitan area
so but i thought
if it's anybody important i would have
to make sure they didn't tell me
anything even privately in my own house
so my my assumption is that my home is
not secure
meaning that that
i can be listened to
now keep in mind i have digital
digital assistants
and i have a bunch of ipads and my phone
it's my understanding that if the
government had a reason to listen in
they could do it am i wrong
if the government had a warrant
fisa
fisa could they not get into my alexa
and just listen to me all day long
if they had a reason yeah they could
right
and do you think that the government
would have trouble
making up a reason for me
i think they could make up a reason for
anybody
and do you think a judge would sign it
obviously yes
because we see that judges will sign
anything
so
what are the odds that i'm not
being targeted not necessarily by the
fbi
but by somebody either a foreign entity
or somebody
yeah i live my life as though everything
i say is public
now that doesn't mean i don't say things
that would be embarrassing
i just mean i'm i think i'm completely
unblackmailable
because there's nothing embarrassing
that would embarrass me
you know like if there's stuff that
would be embarrassing
but it wouldn't embarrass me i mean i
would just think it was funny
uh
in the bedroom also yeah i mean i have i
have a digital assistant in my bedroom
as well yeah there's nothing there's
literally nothing that i could imagine
that they would uh surface about me that
i wouldn't think is funny ultimately
could trump name the fbi a terrorist
organization
i i don't think he will oh the russell
brand thing is uh
unscheduled now
so
so a few weeks ago i had a megan kelly
podcast
semi-scheduled
they got unscheduled
and i had a russell brand
podcast interview that was
semi-scheduled
but now it's on schedule
um
why you ask
i don't know
i don't know in the case of russell
brand he had some
schedule uncertainty and it didn't work
with my schedule availability and
uncertainty
so we had a day picked but i i ended up
having to schedule that day for
something else
so
um
might happen they might you know either
one of them could be rescheduled
i'm
i'm not sure i'll do either one of them
though
see i made an exception in both cases
i've been not doing it i don't know if
you've noticed but i've i haven't been
doing interviews
for quite some time
and i i wasn't going to do any more like
i was just going to stop doing them
uh unless i'm promoting a book or
something if you're promoting a book
then then you got to do what you got to
do
but
i only said yes because they were such
prominent
prominent podcasts and they're both
people that i respect you know i i'd
love i'd love to be on megan kelly's
show because i think she's amazing at
what she does
and russell brand as well
so
so i made an exception for both of them
and then they both kind of fell through
and they were just work
because every time you
you know you're negotiating to be on you
got phone calls and emails and
you've got to set aside a time and then
you can't do anything else in that time
because you set it aside
and you know you can't take a vacation
unless you cancel that sort of thing
so i feel like maybe i won't do either
one what do you think
is there any reason i should do any
podcasts it's not about them but should
i do any podcasts
is there any reason
because i'm really just creating
entertainment
on another channel i mean it would
it would the only thing i could see that
would make a difference
um it doesn't sell books
right so if you're thinking oh people
will buy your book that doesn't work
you know
it works if you have a brand new book
it doesn't work if you're just a person
who has books
and it's not going to drive much traffic
here
if if that's something i even wanted to
do
have you noticed that i don't promote
the live stream as much as you'd expect
i mean i do a little
have you ever noticed that have you ever
noticed the conspicuous lack of
promotion for the live stream
i just do the basics right i tweet it
blah blah blah i mentioned if somebody
asks
but i don't know if i want it bigger
there's something about the size the
size of this
um interaction
that feels right
right
it's believe it or not even with the
size of audience it's still intimate
if i had a million listeners
it would just feel different
and i i don't think the world would be a
better place necessarily
and as you've noted before
um
odin of all says the same thing
yeah i'm not surprised
yeah i don't want to lose the intimacy
that makes this
something i like to wake up and do
the you know i i say this all the time
but i'm not sure how much you believe me
i do this
because i enjoy it and i think it's
important
now i also monetize it because you know
why not
i'm doing it anyway why wouldn't i
monetize it um
but really at this point
it's about the experience you know the
the shared experience and about doing
something useful
so if i can influence the influencers
that's all i need
i i don't need 10 million
viewers that's not going to help me
you say i could change russell brand's
mind on some issues
i doubt it
i doubt it
where do you think we disagree
no i i think he has a little bit more
fun with maybe some um conspiracy
theory
stuff
that i wouldn't disagree with i just
maybe i wouldn't go as far as he did but
you know if if it's speculative there's
nothing to disagree with
have you ever been invited to bill maher
i did bill maher's show
during the first trump clinton election
and on his show i predicted that trump
would win as
as did
ann
why am i blanking
ann coulter yeah ann coulter also did
she did it before i did hers gets all
the hits
you know when they when they when they
show her predicting that trump would win
and everybody's laughing at her
you know but they're showing it in the
context of she was right after all
they never show mine
i was on his show and i said he'd win
and things got real quiet when i said it
but they didn't laugh
because by the time i was on the show he
had already gained a lot of traction
so they weren't laughing by that
but they got really quiet
when i said he's going to win
they got really quiet
because i think by the time i said it
they're like oh really maybe
uh
hold out for gupfield
well i'll definitely do uh greg's show i
mean i would do i would do guffeld just
because uh for fun
right just because i'm friends with him
so that would be fun i like your show
and
i'll probably do that
but i wouldn't count that as like the
other podcasts
all right uh
let me tell you a strategy that i used
that
i can now reveal to you because if i
told you before
you would not believe it was a good idea
but now it's obviously a good idea so i
can tell you
do you remember
when i said famously that if rip
that if biden got elected republicans
would be hunted
anybody remember that
because they got a lot of pushback
now you can see that there's
something going on
like republicans being hunted
now i'm not a republican as you know
i'm not even conservative
but i'm lumped into that group by
everybody who's you know on the left so
they would assume i'm in the same group
now
given that i could be in that group of
targeted people
what did it buy me
to say publicly that republicans would
be hunted
go
what did i do strategically
that protected me
so here's the thing
if you're the person who became famous
by saying saying republicans would be
hunted
they have to do you last
you get that
because i'm the most famous person for
saying that we would be we
we would be targeted
if they targeted me first
then they would prove i'm right
right
that's the last thing they want to do
so by being the most vocal person about
people on the right or associated with
the right
being targeted i largely guaranteed that
they'd do me last
oh they're still going to do me they're
going to take me out i'm pretty sure of
it
i think they'll at least take me out
economically and
influence wise but they have to wait
if they do me too soon
it's just too obvious
but if they do me last then there will
be nobody left to say hey you got rid of
that guy
i'll just be the last one
so i feel like they can't do me too soon
right
now they might wait till like the
presidential election because getting
rid of me before the midterms would make
no difference at all
because i'm not really going to have any
effect on the midterms
but would i have any effect on the
presidential election
yes
well let me ask you
let's let's forget about the past
let's just say there's another
another election
do you think that i could move the
needle on a national election
what do you think
could i personally move the needle
on a national election
and remember national elections are sort
of a two percent difference
so if you believe that the election
would have been you know a two percent
difference no matter what
how comfortable are you knowing that i
exist
well if you're on my side meaning that
you agree with you know my notions about
stuff then you're probably comfortable
with it
but imagine you were on the left
and you came to believe that i actually
could move the election by two percent
you would have to get rid of me
now i don't know that they believe that
i don't know that there's anybody who
would have the power to take me out
who believes i can make any difference
what do you think
do you think that people on the left to
think i can make any difference because
i don't
i think the people on the left would
consider me irrelevant
but there might be some people on the
left who think differently
i change your vote somebody says
well let me ask you here how many of you
changed a vote because of me
how many of you changed your vote to
trump because of something i said
should it should be mostly not right
so i'm seeing some yeses sprinkled in
with mostly no's which is what i'd
expect
expect mostly now
right
no no no but but you'll see on both
platforms there are yeses
and can you see that
even with this you know unscientific
sample
you can tell you can tell i moved the
needle
because i'm not sure how many other
people could have asked that question
and gotten any yeses
if charlie kirk asked hey did i change
your vote well would anybody say yes
you know no but charlie kirk you changed
my mind because he's a you know very
prominent
political figure
i i feel like
uh
yeah
joe rogan so joe rogan said
jokingly but maybe not jokingly
that you should consider voting
republican if you don't like how things
are going
do you think that joe rogan can make
people vote republican and again just
two percent of them i'm not talking
about most people you think he can move
the needle
i'd say yes
do you think that uh
joe rogan uh
almost got cancelled
yes
so because he can move the needle and i
believe he can
uh the attempt to cancel him was pretty
aggressive pretty aggressive
but apparently it failed
he was already too big to get canceled
and i think his brand helped him
you know if your brand is
well i i think he just has a hard to
cancel brand
because his
you know he's he's willing to go
wherever
wherever the fun is basically
uh they tried to cancel him over
ivormectin yes
elon also said to vote republicans yeah
i guess he kind of did did he
is the favorite rapper or thing what
what about andrew tate
i believe he's he's been disappeared
so you can clean your memory because
you'll
you're not going to see much of him
again
i think
i think he's i think he disappeared
so
you know again i i'm opposed to the
censoring of andrew tate even though
he's no friend of mine
uh
i don't like the uh the censoring
but you have to admit they did a good
job
right
the the social media platforms just
completely erased him
and i i think that he can't use payment
platforms or anything like he can't do
banking
um at least for you know this kind of
business
uh so he's on rumble okay
being on rumble is
is a partial solution
yeah what happened to the january 6
committee
yeah
what what about the uh
well you're too nice
cassandra what about the january 6
committee didn't work out
apparently that didn't work out
so they got to go to the
yeah the trump
security boxes
all right
uh yeah what about the durham report
amazing
um
you missed clipping out voice clone
permission no i deleted the
hot tub video
um
all right
did they find the person who leaked the
leaked row at the supreme court i doubt
it
uh can you reframe common sense i don't
know why
i mean i've said in my books that common
sense is an illusion
there's no such thing as common sense
common sense is what you say when you
don't have a reason
you know that right
you say it's common sense
when you don't have a reason
um trump for speaker of the house i mean
that's a clever idea because he could be
speaker of the house but it just doesn't
fit his personality
um
that was way down again today
stocks are down
will he take your advice who
uh
fairness is common sense right and
fairness is an illusion
all right
uh
do you mean everything is fixed since
the origin of the universe
yeah the the argument for no free will
doesn't mean that everything is fixed
since the universe it just means that
even though some things might be random
uh it just means you couldn't predict
them
you know
anyway that's boring
um
can desantis be both vp and florida
governor no
how low will crypto go
well
didn't everybody assume that most crypto
would go to zero
i mean everybody believed that right so
the question is would there be any that
did not go to zero would there be any
winners
and i i think bitcoin will have value
i don't know what else will but i think
bitcoin will last a while
will trump run if the house and senate
don't flip oh that's a good question
uh would you mind to share the day that
justin died
uh
not really
i appreciate that you would like to pray
for him
but no i don't wanna i don't wanna share
that
um
nassim tala predicted the doom of crypto
when it was at his highest
well
talib is really good at
um
getting famous for saying things that
are really obvious
so he i'm not sure where he became an
intellectual because the things he's
most famous for are just the most
obvious things
now it could be that they're obvious
because he said them
like the the black swan idea
i think people knew
that there would be big shocks that made
most of the difference i'm not sure he
added too much to that
but it's a good concept so
the railroads might strike oh great
read his books it's different than you
think i've tried to read his writing
it's it's unreadable
it's almost impenetrable
do ideas exist interesting
yeah talib is well respected at the
highest levels of finance
by everybody
i don't know
um
check the most recent video of satoshi
endorsing that
do you think it's worth reading the
great books of the western world nope
i don't
uh
and usually with naval
uh
people in my own are trying their best
bachelor for their sort of this minute
oh interesting
so here's a comment on
youtube it says i'm a black man first
time listener and i have to acknowledge
how people in my community are trying
the best
backtrack from their support of this
administration everyone is silent now
yeah i think that's
in a way that could be the biggest story
of 2024.
i i think if trump
tried hard to get the black vote
i think i think it would be historic i
believe the black vote is completely
available for a republican who just
tries
just try
you know just just put like a serious
effort into it
in a republican way you don't have to
become a democrat but just do it in a
republican way
i think it's just a gigantic
gigantic
possibility of a shift
the the latinos apparently are coming
along for free
you know
i i'm trying to think about how many um
how many people i know were born
in let's say mexico or central america
that i know today
and how many of them i would describe as
like woke
and the answer is none
none
i'm not sure that they're republicans i
don't think they would identify that way
but if you looked at um
let's say their uh
their philosophy is about things
it it maps pretty close to sort of a
catholic sensibility and so it gets
pretty pretty close to a republican
and you have you have a group of people
whose
i would say their
their view of life
is work first
am i wrong the people who come to
america
most of them
the ones that are coming illegally
across the border
it's work first
they're putting work above
comfort
country
being near their family
work first
now if you're a republican and you see
somebody who's work first
you don't hate them
you do not hate them
you you respect that
now you might say i wish you could spend
more time in your family that'd be great
but these are people who are taking the
hard choices and they're doing it for
their family and for the future so
they're very future oriented
they've connected what they do today
to what the future will bring them
it looks so republican to me i mean it
looks super republican
and
like i said they're not woke
they're not dealing with you use the
wrong word
they don't care about any of that
so
i'd be amazed if if they are not mostly
republican in the future
you're already seeing some shift
but if the republicans just tried a
little bit
a little bit
they could just take a huge chunk of
that
by the way trump could just say what i
said
you know the fact that we're trying to
keep out people who put work first
you really have to ask yourself
especially when our biggest problem is a
collapsing
um a collapsing population
according to elon musk and a lot of
smart people and it's my opinion as well
we have more risk from a collapsing
population than anything else
and here we have
millions of people
who have a catholic sensibility
work first
sacrifice to work because you know
that'll build us a future you don't want
those people in your country
if you said who do you want your country
i'd say
people who have you know some kind of
moral
moral background
and
they've planned
like a reasonable plan for their future
and they work really hard to make it
happen for the next generation you tell
me i don't want those people in my
country
i want i want lots of them in my country
lots of them
more of the better
now legally of course
legally of course
in fact here's how i would handle all of
immigration
i heard a lot of people complaining
about giving uh illegal immigrants free
phones
i'd probably give them free phones
you know why
because they'll take them and you could
track them
you can track them if you give them a
phone you control them
so i would want to control them
and one way you could you could game the
whole system is just say let everybody
in just give them a phone
if if we find you without your phone
we're going to arrest you
and just say you can be here as long as
you keep your phone
and if you lose your phone we'll replace
it or whatever if it breaks but
basically
if you get separated from your phone
like too far for too long it's not like
if you forgot it somewhere but if you
get if you try to get rid of your phone
and get a regular phone well you go to
jail
or you get deported
but as long as we can keep an eye on you
because because here's what you could do
if you had an app
so you need an immigration app
everybody who comes here illegally gets
one of these phones
now remember if if the government is
buying them we're not buying iphones
you know you're not you're not buying
the 1200 phone it's probably the
it's probably the 300 phone i don't know
something like that if you get them in
bulk
and then you put on it an app that
allows them to
get get hired
by companies that need the labor and
also to get paid through the app only
so so you'd only be paid through the app
you couldn't get paid any other way and
then the app would be connected to
something or it didn't have to be
and
i don't know i i think you could you
could just literally open the border if
you gave everybody a phone
because the people who were doing bad
stuff you'd find them
now of course the criminals would get in
that way but i feel like they're getting
in anyway
if there's nothing you can do about the
criminals getting in maybe you just
have to have to do something else
all right
uh just an idea i don't think it's
necessarily the best idea in the world
but i'll put it out there
warren buffett is 92 today
boy you know about um
probably 20 years ago i sold my
berkshire hathaway stock
because i thought warren buffett
couldn't last that long
i thought that when he dies the stock
will tank
even though there's no reason for it
because the company is still would be
solid
but i thought emotionally the stock
would tank when he died now he's 92 and
he's still still going strong
so i guess wrong
how do you feel about surgically
transitioning minors
really
really
what do you think i feel about that
surgically
transitioning miners
like just guess
what do you think my opinion on that is
because that's not about lgbtq
i'm very pro-lgbtq but that's not an
lgbt
tq question
that's a child
a child question
has more to do with you know how do you
handle children going through
phases and stuff
yeah
no that's obviously wrong
i i won't even have an argument with
somebody who says you should
uh transition children
like to me that's
as soon as you say the statement
somebody wants to chemically transition
children to another gender
i don't even want to have a debate about
that
that's just no
no
right
there's no details
no
nope nope nope nope nope nope
um
you know people who argue it online well
let me tell you this
are there people that you absolutely can
tell
are not going to be happy in the gender
they're in and can you tell if they're
13
what do you think
do you think there are some people
that absolutely would benefit
from the transition
so
no
nobody
here's my view
i believe absolutely
there are some people who would benefit
from the transition as children
i do
here's the problem
you don't know which ones they are
you don't know which ones they are
so it has to be a solid no no way
no how
nope don't know
it's exactly the same as um
statutory rape
do you think that every 16 year old who
has sex with somebody who's over 18
is damaged for life
the answer is no
no
but should you therefore make it legal
for adults to have sex with children no
no
because you don't know which ones are
going to be perfectly fine and which
ones will be damaged for life
so that's just a no
right if if you're dealing with children
there are a lot more situations which
are just no
you know so even if you spot that 13
year old where you're positive and all
the doctors are positive that this kid
would be better with a transition
still no
still no because i can do it later just
wait a few years
remove all doubt
if that makes sense to me
because i don't think you want to take
the chance of that one person being
transitioned who shouldn't have been
that just that's just way too big a risk
in my view
so
no that's my answer even though i will
allow
i will allow that that would be a burden
on some people
i will allow that there's no there's no
100 clean answer but there is a clean
policy
knowing what to do about it i think is
easy
but if you go further and say that will
be good for everybody that's a little
too far you know you have to you have to
accept that somebody's going to pay the
price for that
all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you youtube tomorrow
bye for now best show you've ever seen
