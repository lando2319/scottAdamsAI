that ladies and gentlemen is the
beautiful beautiful sound of multiple
documents being tapped on my desk and
that means my printer is online and
everything's working smoothly today and
this might be the highlight of not only
your personal experience but
civilization itself and it's called the
coffee with Scott Adams and it's the
best thing that's ever happened and all
you need to use a copper regular glass
of tank which I'll start the canteen
sugar flaska Festival of any kind fill
with your favorite liquid
audio is looking good
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopam media the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it's
going to happen right now go
ah it's better every time
now if I haven't told you yet today
you're gonna have a wonderful day
oh sure you'll have your ups and downs
always do but today is going to be great
because you're better looking and
smarter than you were yesterday and
that's all going to work for you
well I had a conversation uh yesterday
with a young woke person
how do you think that went
do you think that if you put a young
woke person and me
in the same conversation
that
it'll be fun
well it was it started out with a
conversation about sexism and all the
sexism and misogyny and discrimination
against uh girls and boys
and I said were you aware
that girls do better than boys
in a lot of different ways
and she was not aware of that and today
by coincidence I saw a list of some of
the things that are going better for
girls than boys now here we're talking
about younger mostly younger folks so it
includes women
uh and girls
and so somebody did a little chart I saw
online I tweeted it earlier this morning
of for every hundred girls or women
how many boys or men are doing the same
thing so for example
how many women uh for for every 100
women who take AP or honors courses in
high school
in art or music how many men do the same
thing honors courses and art and music
only 54.
so they're almost twice as many women
who attain this high level in school
and then you go right down the line who
is who earns an associate's degree who
takes these AP courses who graduates
who's got a master's degree who's in the
top 10 percent and every one of these is
women or girls
every one of them
so on educational attainment it's not
even close
women are just smoking then not even
close
did you know that
how many woke young people are aware
that women are just destroying men
at the at least the entry level which
predicts the future
um
how about health related stuff and
mental health again an entire list of
things that women are way better off
than men I'll just give you examples
basically it's about dying from suicide
and everything from autism to learning
disorders people are homeless you know
twice as many men and boys are homeless
die of homicide you know seven times
more die in prison you know 13 times
more it's not even close
if you take most of the measures of
well-being
women and girls are all of the top it's
not even close
now what do you think happened when I
mentioned that to a young woke person
did the Young woke person say you know
that's not exactly what I've been
hearing but I'm going to take it under
advisement maybe maybe do a little
research myself and possibly even change
my worldview
do you think that happened
no the conversation very quickly turned
to my uh by racism
and so I said well if you think you live
in a world in which it's hard to be a
woman
and it's hard to be black
can you explain to me why black women
are getting into college and and
achieving more
um scholastically at the moment
than white men
can you explain to me how black women
who have two strikes against them
according to you you the woke person
they have two strikes against them and
they're big ones according to you black
and female
so can you explain why they're doing so
well
why is it that they're getting into
college at higher rates than white men
which also suggests that they'll have
higher incomes now of course we're not
talking about 50 years ago that's a
whole different situation but how many
woke young people were aware
that if you're both black and a woman
it's it's one of the best things you'd
be do you know what's the only thing
that's better than being black and
female in terms of educational
you know
um let's say the educational first step
or even the ultimate step of getting
your degree the only thing better than
being a black woman is being a white
woman
but being a woman is a pretty good deal
in 2022 educationally
which should also translate into career
which should translate into income
Etc
all right now
when uh when the question of racism came
up I did the uh the Chappelle reframe
and the Chappelle reframed goes like
this
let me ask you who do you think is
suffering more
uh Tiger Woods or a poor white person in
Appalachia
and of course Tiger Woods is doing a
little bit better he's got his issues
too but he's doing better than the
poorest of white people
yeah how many do you think that Michael
Jordan
gets discriminated against more
than say an average white person
and the answer is no no he doesn't he's
discriminated less you probably guessed
more things than the average person
and so I was explaining to her that it
always has been about rich versus poor
that's what Chappelle explains very well
and that she has been hypnotized into
believing it's a racial problem so that
the rich people can cover up the fact
that they're in power and that they're
suppressing other people to keep their
power
now what happens when you hear that for
the first time
something something this person had
never heard
never heard that if you're rich and
black you're in pretty good shape
and if you're poor and white you're in
pretty bad shape
am I right there's not much to argue
with there
now
yeah I had explodes right and and it
reminded me how little information gets
from one bubble to the next
and I was also thinking how many times
um am I
discriminated against for race or gender
every day
what do you think do you think that I
ever go a day without over overt very
direct
discrimination against me for being
either male or white
I don't think I've ever gone today
not once not in my public life if you if
you look at my Twitter
you can see almost every day I think
somebody accusing me of something that's
you can tell is based on my my gender
and my race
and they're usually incorrect that is
racism right
people making direct assumptions about
my beliefs
based on my my gender and my race and
they're usually wrong that's I get that
every day
you know and most of you know my famous
story of being denied promotions in two
different corporate worlds because I was
white and because I was male and they
told me that directly that's not my
interpretation they said directly your
white your male we can't promote you
now how many black people have ever had
that happen to him
probably some
you know I'm sure there are black people
who have exactly the same experience
we're not going to hire you for your
because you're black maybe they didn't
say it out loud
but you know what's happening somewhere
right so definitely it's happening
but to imagine that it's black people
getting all the discrimination and white
people getting none of it and that uh
it's about race is missing the big story
it's also about race I'm not denying
racism exists of course I'm just saying
it's everywhere all the time and that
rich people do better and poor people do
worse and that's the whole story
and once I explained it to her
there's not much you can say about it am
I right
unless you change unless you just change
the topic
there's not any real response to that
because the data is pretty clear right
and the facts that I presented
are not really in question
you know there's not not really a
question did you or did you not you know
get discriminated in employment I I
could give you thousands of witnesses to
back up my story because they were there
at the same time and they were also
discriminated for the same reasons also
directly so yeah I could produce
presumably thousands of actually I could
probably produce a thousand Witnesses
with one tweet to back up you know my
version of events
so I wondered what would happen if
somebody that woke heard something so
counter to their worldview
um and uh the result was the change of
the topic the change of the topic
because I don't think you can convince
anybody of anything anymore but you can
change the topic
so that's what happened
uh so I know you want me to talk about
Disney
like I don't know why I can't care less
about this story
maybe because I don't care about Disney
or something I don't know no I get the
importance of it and how it you know is
related to Trends and all that uh but
you know as a Disney's going woke and
they're removing their their gender
greetings so they won't say welcome boys
and girls it'll be welcome
carbon-based units or something I don't
know exactly what they're replacing it
with but it doesn't sound quite as
friendly
and of course they're opposing the uh
I guess the manipulatively named Bill
dosage which really isn't about that at
all
um
and so they're going whoa so here's my
only comment
from a business perspective since Disney
has to satisfy their shareholders
presumably they should do what's good
for the the share price
within reason of course not not doing
anything illegal but what is the
argument that they will make more money
by doing this
you could easily make an argument that
they'll make less money
because I think you would you're going
to get less or fewer I just gave you
that lesson don't say less say fewer
you're going to get fewer guests of the
conservative types going to Disney
so why would Disney a corporate entity
who has an obligation to the
shareholders why would they do something
that feels like it can only reduce their
business but it can never increase it
why would they do that
I guess you know individuals are afraid
for their jobs and their reputations so
it's not for the shareholders and you
could argue whether it's for the good of
society I guess
um I I don't know I just don't care that
much about this story I guess I should
I don't know why but I don't
I guess I don't care because it's too
easy to talk about
you just say I don't like that and
you're done that's about it
all right you remember that big
Ivermectin study I talked about a few
days ago and uh it was the big gold
standard you know randomized controlled
lots of lots of people in it to find out
if I ever met him worked or not and of
course that totally settled the question
once and for all
no it didn't
and then I was asked today to uh
to tweet or comment on the fact that uh
there there is criticism of the study
and the criticism is actually kind of
hilarious by itself that the uh I guess
the categories don't even add up
you know when they say we're we're
testing X number of people of this type
and then you look at the subcategories
and you add them up and it doesn't equal
the number of people they're testing
so so it's not even internally
consistent meaning you can't even look
at their own numbers and say well why
does this column not
not match what they said they were doing
you know that sort of thing now
is is the person doing the debunk
the correct one
or could somebody come along and debunk
the debunker
and get you right back to hey well maybe
this study's good probably
so I just want you to know that there's
no such thing
uh
there's no such thing as a reliable
study whenever there's any political or
Pharma profit thing involved there's no
such thing as a study you could trust so
there is an eye from active study that
says it doesn't work I would give its
credibility I don't know
10 or something that's about it so if
you think I'm saying that Ivermectin
definitely doesn't work in any scenario
whatsoever because there's a study that
says that
um I guess I just can't do that anymore
I just can't tell you because there's a
high quality study that it's true
it just that just doesn't work in 2022.
if I had to um
but let me say this and this is not
based on I guess analysis it's based on
more like
sometimes you just have to guess which
is right
if you put a gun to my head and said you
have to pick does Ivermectin work or
does it not and we're actually just
going to kill you if you get the wrong
answer
I would bet it doesn't work
don't know if I'm right because I don't
think that the I don't think that the
data can ever answer that question
because we don't live in a world where
data is reliable
but that would be my guess
and if you guess differently uh I'm not
even going to argue with you because
since my guess is not based on reason
I have a question for you
does evil exist
does evil exist
lots of yeses on the locals platform
mostly yeses now
can somebody Define evil outside of uh
mental illness
because my frame on life is that some
people have mental illness and some
people don't or actually we all do but
it's a different kind I guess you could
say everybody's got some kind of mental
illness just some some less than others
up I don't really buy into the evil
explanation because I don't know what it
adds
what does it add
because thinking in terms of you know
demons and angels and and god-like you
know demonic stuff I don't know what it
adds to your understanding or what does
it add to your process do you do
something differently because of that
prey
something like that
I don't know
um I say evil is just your subjective
opinion of stuff you're seeing I don't
believe that evil exists as any kind of
a
quantity or a force in the world I just
think some people are broken
that's all and you get exactly the same
result
so I don't think you need to go to the
complicated explanation that you know
we've got souls and some of them are
corrupted or you know controlled by
Satan or anything
um I think you just go for the easiest
explanation that some people have mental
problems
and that's it that's it
because it does explain everything
if there were something it didn't
explain
then I would revise it but if it
explains everything and it doesn't
require you to believe anything that's
not obvious and right in front of you
right mental illness is obvious and true
and right in front of you
but evil
I don't know can you get a handful of
evil
can you measure it this one's you know
200 the evil of this other one I don't
know the evil is real
but it's real in the sense of how we I
guess process our environment so for
some of you it's real for me I've never
sensed it felt it
framed it that way
considered it as even anything important
yeah the the Nazi death camps okay there
let's let's take the extreme example the
Nazi death camps
that could all be explained in terms of
normal human processes
because we know that we can get
underlings to do literally anything
are they evil or are they just
underlings who will do anything because
they're afraid of whatever happens to
them I don't know and then some of the
underlings are sadists
form of mental illness You could argue
or is it a personality disorder I never
know but
I don't know I guess I would say that I
don't have a use for that frame
which is different than say it doesn't
exist
so the question of does evil exist is
unanswerable because whatever it is you
know it's not like you can
there's no measuring device for it you
know there's no such thing as a detector
for it so we'll never we'll never agree
on whether it exists or not but could we
agree it doesn't have a use like framing
the world that way does it help I feel
like it would just be scary to live in a
world that you framed Us full of evil
and demons whereas I just see broken
stuff oh there's a somebody with a
broken brain
and they might act a certainly
yeah so yeah maybe it's useful within
the context of a religion
scientists have finally completed the
human genome so we have actually for the
first time a hundred percent of the
human genome has been mapped
so we're going to learn a lot more about
genetic diseases and stuff it was only
eight percent of it or so the last eight
percent I guess is all we didn't have
already but now imagine putting together
artificial intelligence
with the human genome
with medical records
with DNA
I don't think we fully understand what's
about to happen
you see what I'm see what I'm saying
the full Human Genome DNA about
individuals uh access to all kinds of
medical records that are I think at this
point we don't have you know access to
them but I think we will
maybe not everybody's but enough medical
records that you could make decisions
about what works and what doesn't
I don't know I think there's something
coming
that will redefine
Health Care substantially
there's a I think it's a small company
that already does a can do a test on you
to find out which kinds of which kinds
of prescription medicines will work the
best
isn't that wild you can now do a test I
think it's a blood test you send it away
blood testers spit I forget
or urine I don't know there's some kind
of a test you do that will come back and
tell you what what drugs will be
effective and which ones don't work for
you
how Wild is that does it work I don't
know I don't know
but think about all these things coming
together how our if you had AI to the
amount of data we're going to get about
everything from DNA to Human Genome to
uh
to you know health records we're going
to know almost everything pretty soon
we're probably 10 years away
from
just not even needing a doctor
meaning that the AI will just be so much
better at figuring out what's going on
that uh they just don't need it
well gem sake spokesperson for Biden is
reportedly going to leave for MSNBC she
hasn't finalized a deal there but the
important thing to know is that
according to people who know more than I
do NBC
is maybe the closest Network to the
cia's control meaning that the most
reliably CIA
messaging entity now I don't know what
the relationship is with the CIA but
people who know more than I do basically
say they're in the bag for the CIA
and
um
and she's going to go work for them
directly from
the spokesperson job
does that bother you
does that bother you at all
that
you worry that the Deep State and you
know whatever John Brennan is doing
lately and all the former and current
Intel people are secretly running the
government
and then you see somebody at that level
of government go directly to MSNBC which
feels like it's in the bag you know the
CIA controls it
or at least for the stories they care
about not the whole thing
and
everything about this is Icky
everything about this is Icky now it's
fully disclosed
but I almost have to ask the question
is she really changing jobs or is she
just being transparent that she's always
worked for MSNBC in the CIA
because I don't even know if they change
your direct deposit do they I'm just
kidding of course they do
but it feels like it's the same job they
just changed the title
am I right it feels like it's the same
job
is not a different job it's the same job
that's the story the story is she didn't
change jobs she changed job titles yeah
I'm exaggerating but you get the point
all right um
here's something that General Omar
Bradley once said
he said an American General he was an
American General during World War II and
he and he's
quoted as saying amateurs talk strategy
professionals talk Logistics meaning
that Wars are won or Lost based on
whether you can resupply your your
military
and CNN is still hammering on this idea
that the Russian army is running out of
fuel and food and everything
and
there are other there are other voices
saying Ah that's just complete
propaganda that's just Ukrainian
propaganda
but let me ask you this
how many big fuel Depots does the
Russian military have within Striking
Distance of the Ukrainian border
because the ukrainians have apparently
taken out one large Fuel Depot
that fueled some some percentage of the
Army on the eastern border the Russian
army
so here's the question for you
if if it's true the Ukraine took out one
large Fuel Depot
how many are there
how many are there
because you know if there are three
Russia is totally am I right
if there are only three
if they took out a third of their fuel
they're in real trouble because remember
you don't have to take out all the fuel
or all the food if you take out 20 30
percent of either the fuel or the food
there's chaos
right they've got to do all kinds of
stuff to adjust to that shortage and
it's not going to be pretty so you don't
have to take it all the way you just
have to degrade it to the point where
they're so ineffective that there's a
Cascade effect to collapse
so so I've asked you a very specific
military question
do you think anybody knows first of all
can anybody make that kind of an
estimate
and could anybody ask our military do we
have any idea
how many large
fuel Depots are there and can they
quickly spin up a new one
in other words uh has Russia already
just sort of you know spun up a new fuel
Depot and it didn't even make a dent
because they have plenty of fuel they
just have to get it to the right place
so
uh yeah Define define large so here's
the question if there are 50 fuel Depots
of that size the size that the
ukrainians allegedly destroyed if there
are 50 of them well then Russia wins for
sure
because they can't you know they're not
going to run into fuel
well what if there were three
right isn't that the right question if
there were only three
the Russian armies already in pretty bad
shape
because they just lost their energy
uh you're watching the wrong Ukraine
movie somebody says
uh what does not spin up as a fuel Depot
you need pipe welders Pipe Fitters yeah
yeah it can be easy
but I don't know maybe maybe they just
have giant tanks of fuel and they can
move them wherever they want
I don't know if you need a gigantic tank
to put the smaller tanks into or or
temporarily maybe you don't
all right
uh so I'm going to say that I am
unconvinced
that Logistics alone will be the decider
in Ukraine but I think it's at least a
50 chance
that the big story will be Logistics by
the way here's a little history lesson
that I also learned by the CNN article
that uh the mistake that Hitler made
attacking Russia
was that he thought it would be fast and
he did not develop his supply lines
correctly he only developed supply lines
and actually clothing warm weather or
cold weather clothing
was not even sufficient for the war
so huge numbers of German troops just
froze to death or got frostbite because
they couldn't even Supply them with warm
jackets
they they never planned for that
somebody says and Napoleon too well so
is is the winter plus the supply line
although the winter seemed like a bigger
factor for Napoleon
so well I suppose it's always Supply
because you could Supply you can survive
any winter if you had enough Supply so
yeah I guess it's Supply
um
I don't know I've been saying since the
beginning uh that the ukrainians can
take out the supply lines and we're
learning more about their uh Kamikaze
drones but then I heard they only had a
hundred of them what the hell good are
100 100 Kamikaze drones you're not going
to win a war with a hundred
I feel like you need
I don't know five thousand
so how fast could we make these things
is somebody cranking out some more yeah
100 to start maybe yeah these are the
the switchblades so it's the little
drones you can launch from your backpack
or carry the backpack it's a little
drone and it just goes up into hovers
for 15 minutes until it finds something
and then it Dives in and destroys it
that's a pretty devastating
psychological weapon
like knowing that there's one hovering
around you and it's just picking out
which which person to kill
I think I'll kill the people in that
truck
very psychologically devastating
so we don't know how many fuel Depots
that there are and we don't know how
many of these switchblade drones there
are but I would say that those two
numbers are the only numbers that will
tell you what's going to happen
so I'm boiling it down the only thing
that will tell you what's happening
is how many drones do the ukrainians
have we don't know
and how much fuel do the Russians have
we don't know
the the only two things that matter and
we don't know either anything about
either with the public the military
probably does
so on uh for the last several days
somebody has been screaming at me on
YouTube in the comments that if I don't
understand what operation gladio is then
I don't understand anything
and so I said to myself well I'll look
into it
because I don't know I I had no reason
to dismiss the comment and whoever was
saying it was was pretty adamant
so here's what operation gladio
reportedly is
NATO has terrorist forces
that's the whole story NATO has
officially trained
terrorists and they use them as leave
behind forces in case your country gets
overrun so if a NATO country gets
overrun
they already have spun up the terrorist
forces that remain as part of the
resistance
and they're actually terrorists
like actually literally terrorists
and apparently there have been a number
of discoveries of these various groups
in different countries and apparently
it's fairly confirmed I mean Wikipedia
treats it like it's a fact
you know if you want to if you want to
take that as your Source but does that
change anything for you
because the the gladio operation gladios
would be terrorists working for your
team are you comfortable having
terrorists on your team
because apparently we do
if you're on team NATO apparently you're
pro-terrorist
sorry
now you could call them saboteurs sure
so depending on the context of you know
has your country been invaded well then
they're not terrorists
then they're Freedom Fighters
but they're basically terrorists now
part of what they would do is false
Flags
now it's getting a little creepy isn't
it so allegedly what these gladio people
would do among other things
is kill civilians of Their Own
to make it look like the other side did
it
so how do you like your team now
how do you like being on team NATO
knowing that your team are literally
terrorists
I'm okay with it
are you is there anybody who has a
problem with it I'm okay with it I mean
it's part of what makes it
um
a bad idea to try to conquer your
neighbor
if anything that NATO does is making it
really really hard to conquer your your
neighbor I'm okay with that
now nobody's in favor of killing
civilians I mean not
not that but as soon as you say we're in
a war
then then the strategy changes to how do
you do well
all right we'd rather have no war but if
you're in one
well you're going to fight the wind
right
so one of the ways to fight to win are
these false flag things the reason
people do it is because it works if it
didn't work people wouldn't do it
so if you want to win you do what works
as ugly as that is so you could be
morally outraged and should be I guess
but it's going to happen anyway your
your moral outrage won't change anything
um
so uh I don't know if the person asking
me to look into that is on here but are
you satisfied or or have I missed
something about this operation gladio
is there any was there anything that
ties it close because I believe
I believe that
the point of it was for me to understand
that NATO is not all uh unicorns and
roses
and I I take that as first of all
something that was obvious in my opinion
but secondly uh okay
I will accept that a little history
lesson I'm not sure ads or subtracts
anything
because war is dirty business so I'm not
I'm not surprised that CIA related
people are doing awful things that's not
new news
all right
um
did you see the Deep fake video of
zelenski so somebody did a AI generated
deep fake in which he was telling his
soldiers to surrender to the Russian
invasion and uh the Deep fake wasn't
that good
but wow how far away are we from not
knowing who's giving you the commands at
all
pretty close right
we're pretty close to not knowing who's
giving the orders as soon as the Deep
fakes get I don't know 20 better
you just won't tell the difference you
won't know if it's your president saying
something or somebody else
um
so keep an eye on that I think this
whole deep fake thing
is just going to be gigantic
so I continue to be entertained by Bill
Maher's conversion to uh
what would I call it uh so he's not
becoming right wing I don't think that's
going to happen but he seems to be able
to see the whole field and so every
Friday he's saying stuff that makes news
at least in Fox News because he's saying
stuff that his team doesn't hear
and I've decided he might be the most
dangerous person in America
well-meaning I mean his intentions are
positive I'm sure but
he's the only person I know who
consistently penetrates the the left
bubble and tells them what they don't
know and haven't heard
think about how dangerous that is
because I don't know anybody else who
can do I can't do it right can you
yeah I can't talk to anybody in the
Democrat bubble and have them hear me I
don't have any channel to them but he
does because he started with them and
you know audiences tend to stick with
you so he so on Friday's show apparently
uh Bill Maher said quote so the new New
York Post got a hold of what was in the
computer talk about hunter's laptop uh
and you know because the New York Post
is a republican paper
that's his description and the New York
Times And The Washington Post are the
Democrat papers again his description
and and the Republican paper
uh and then he goes Twitter canceled
their account talked about the New York
Post they can't even report the story
so you see he's being amazed
that a true story got canceled from the
internet and he noticed
now he hasn't noticed all the stuff
that's happened but this one was just
too shockingly big and so he's calling
it out and
uh
so he's just like the right-leaning
media is pointing out the mainstream
media
suppressed one of the most important
stories of the election cycle now Bill
Maher did not go as far as he could have
in saying that it probably influenced
the election result
and therefore one could say
the election was rigged and therefore
one could say that Trump was right
although I think he was talking more
about vote rigging which would be
different and nobody's proven that in
any scale
so
um somebody says billboard needs an ego
death now I'm pretty sure I don't know
this I'm speculating
but if Bill Maher has not done mushrooms
mushrooms don't exist
if he hasn't done them uh I'd be pretty
amazed pretty amazed and that's based on
not only the lifestyle he promotes
but also the fact that he is relatively
aware
and that's one of the ways you get there
um
so in my opinion Bill Maher has figured
out maybe 25 of what's Happening
maybe 50 percent
but I tweeted Adam and I included him in
the tweet
and I said the most dangerous person in
America is Bill Maher because he is
capable of penetrating the Democrat
bubble and telling them their new
sources are fake
and then I said he's figured out about
25 of what's Happening he still believes
the fine people hoax and the drinking
bleaks hoax
do you see what I did there
all right now here's some context I've
been on Bill Marshall once
and it was before the 2016 election and
I predicted on his show that Trump would
win and I explained why based on his
persuasive powers
Bill Maher listened to everything I said
and did not push back at all
which I thought was unusual
because I was saying things clearly
supportive of trump he's clearly the
opposite and not once
he didn't push back on anything
now maybe he thought the persuasion
angle wasn't that important or a little
office you know his uh sweet spot or
something but
um I will say that if he remembers who I
am I'm guessing he does
if he remembers who I am he would
probably remember that on his show I was
reasonable
and that I sounded like a not a crazy
right-wing you know person
and I feel I established at least a
little bit of credibility
by saying things on his show that didn't
get any pushback and were new you know
they were they were new for his audience
and didn't get pushback and it was
important it explained what was
happening and accurately predicted now
if anything I just said is true
which is that I gained at least a little
bit of credibility in my small
interaction with him on his show
then if he were to see this tweet and by
you know that's by no means certain but
usually when the blue checks tweeted
each other
I feel like we usually see it what do
you think you know some people are more
active on their social media I don't I
don't think Bill Maher is Super Active
on Twitter you know but he's a he's a
super user but I don't know how many
minutes he spends there and
I think he'd probably see it just
because I added it
so you'd probably see it
now if you were him
and you knew that I'd said incredible
the same things on the show that nobody
even argued with
and you heard me say something that
would blow your mind that the fine
people hoax and the drinking bleach hoax
or hoaxes
and I'm sure that's the first time he
would have heard it in a way that
doesn't sound crazy
you may have heard Fox News said which
doesn't sound credible you may have
heard I don't know somebody will say it
if he did
but I feel as though
I feel as though
there's some chance that I got that
message through
I'm I may have slipped the puck past the
the keeper and the reason is because
first of all because it's Bill Maher
and he's open to
a competing idea
so if it were not him this wouldn't work
at all secondly because the blue checks
probably check each other's comments
and thirdly because the context I waited
until he was already primed
to believe that the news is hugely
manipulated on his side
do you see what I did here
I waited until he was primed while he's
talking about the his own news sources
being illegitimate
he's talking about it now while he's
talking about his new sources being
illegitimate I give him two things that
coming from me
should just blow the top of his head off
if he notices right I mean I I'm not
going to assume I'm important enough in
the scheme of things that you
necessarily is going to even notice
but in theory so this is sort of a
impromptu persuasion lesson if you can
if you can throw a mind thought
into somebody who's already in the mode
it's a whole different idea than coming
as somebody you're both loaded and ready
for an argument
if you're both loaded and ready for an
argument nobody's nobody changes their
mind
but if you can catch somebody in a
vulnerable moment
when they've already talked themselves
into the point of view that you're
promoting
and you're just giving them a little
extra of where they already are because
do you know what people do like
they love confirmation by us of their
own opinion they'll accept that in a
moment that's not changing their mind
that's hard
changing anybody's mind is really hard
work which is why persuasion is an
important topic it's so hard if you
don't do everything right you don't have
a chance
so
I think there's some chance
that I planted a seed that would be
productive here's what I love
in my perfect world
Bill Maher will see the full videos of
the fine people hoax and the full video
of the drinking bleach oats and he will
realize that the two biggest really
messages about Trump were entirely made
up
the two biggest ones
and I don't know
if that's expecting too much of anybody
because it is kind of you know so I have
a high opinion of Bill Maher's mental
let's say openness and flexibility you
know different than most people very
different
but this is a stretch to get somebody to
believe this much of a mind is
something really basic to the reality
just didn't happen just never happened
and it's easy to prove that's the weird
part if it were hard to prove
then people could hold on to their their
assumption but you just have to play the
video that's it the entire debunk is
just like well let me play the whole
video not the clip that reverses its
meaning
thank you well ladies and gentlemen is
my prepared marks for today
uh no doubt this peak experience is
something that will stay with you
forever
or for several minutes one
um is there a topic which I have not
covered
which you'd like to hear me cover
um
all right
uh the how do you debunk the don't say
gay
well unfortunately the don't say gay
thing is really a masterpiece of
persuasion
whoever whoever frames something first
as a big advantage and the don't say gay
people framed it best they framed it
with a rhyme which is really good
say and gay Rhymes that's a good
technique is short it's easy to remember
it's it's repeatable
and that becomes true
so it doesn't even matter
dogs and blankets I like that I'm seeing
a picture of a dog in a blanket on the
locals platform they can they can put
pictures in the comments
um
by the way
uh last night I did a
live stream from the man caves these are
only available for the people who
subscribe on locals so while you missed
was my story about meeting a psychic and
hypnotizing her and some of the
predictions she made which were just
insane a visit with my own spirit guide
or not I can only tell you what seems to
have happened
I'm not sure what really happened uh and
they uh tying that in with the uh the
simulation and all the evidence for the
simulation that we live in a simulation
now if you think that sounds good and
not only were there simultaneous sips
but uh let's just say that the man cave
is simultaneous whatever
so you are allowed to do is
simultaneously whatever you wanted
well I did the same
and
when am I going on guffeld again so yes
um I don't know it's not up to me
so
um
looks like I have uh answered all of
your questions
are you saying that Bill Maher has a
podcast where he and Quentin Tarantino
got Stoned on the podcast
well I would like to uh put out my
challenge right now
to Snoop Dogg
Snoop Dogg
number one I'm a cartoonist
and I'm guessing you have no no idea who
I am
um but I do this cartoon called Dilbert
some people have heard of it and I
challenge you Snoop Dogg
to join me in my man cave in California
Northern California
and to see who can
let's say you can be more of the Snoop
Dogg if you know what I mean this is
this is YouTube so I'm gonna keep it
generic generic if there are any young
kids watching kids don't do drugs
and I mean that
sounds like a joke but no kids don't do
drugs
that said
uh how much would you like to see me
interview Snoop Dogg while we're seeing
who can last the longest if you know
what I mean
come on you'd watch that
you'd watch it now I don't think that
Snoop would know enough about me or that
would ever make sense to him but it
would be awesome
and I think it would be viral as hell I
don't I don't think I could talk him
into it because he just wouldn't be
familiar with me I'm guessing I mean if
if Kanye
somehow knew who I was it's not
impossible
but unlikely
so that's the that's the uh the ask
Snoop Dogg in my man cave
let's do it and by the way I'm a huge
fan of Snoop Dogg uh
I I love the fact that he never changed
who he was I guess that's what I like
best you know I like his music I like
his whole vibe but I like the fact that
uh he changed the world like the world
didn't change him
you know that right
like Snoop just said I'm just going to
be me and the world is going to have to
catch up and then it did
who does that who does that but he
didn't
all right
um that is all for now and uh
I'm going to go do some work I got a lot
of it
oh I'm hearing from Sonny San Rafel
somebody's watching
so if somebody knows Snoop get to him
and make the offer
and we'll go from there and
for the rest of you
can you have a great day pretty sure you
can
go forth
