[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
Civilization now I don't like to
overpromise and underd
deliver but I'm pretty sure this will be
the best live stream you see today maybe
in your whole life oh yeah we're going
to make some news today even if nobody
talks about it is going to be news to us
and if you'd like to enjoy this amazing
amazing event that's upcoming well all
you need for that is a cup or muger a
glass a tanker chal ofstein a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
happens
now oh
oh so
satisfying well there's so much news and
so much persuasion coming that I'm just
going to jump right into
it first story a gray whale NBC news
says a gray whale that has is extinct
from the Atlantic for more than 200
years was spotted off the New England
coast so the whale which is extinct for
200 years was spotted off the New
England
coast I can only assume that Wales have
developed time travel
abilities sometime in the
past and are now reappearing in the
future time
traveling gray
whales I can't think of any other
explanation for how something extinct
could suddenly be here
again Star Trek time traveling Wales
yeah there's something about the
Starship ENT entprise
probably is related to the story
anyway here's a theory I heard the other
day I just want to run past you I'm not
going to say that this is scientifically
proven but it sounds like it might be
and it matches my personal
experience and the idea was that a man
doesn't have the ability to be
happy not even the ability unless in
close physical contact
with women who could
reproduce now the the the second level
of this is women who could reproduce and
that excludes people who would be in the
pill and the idea is that women put off
a I don't know pheromone or some kind of
some kind of thing in the air that men
pick up and even if they're not
conscious of it being affecting them
that they they know they're in the
presence of something that could be
reproduction situation even if nobody's
thinking it yeah it could be you know
your best friend or something doesn't
have to be somebody you actually think
you could get with but the just the
chemistry of it would make men happy and
they wouldn't know
why now men in the
comments can you tell me or not tell me
that you feel visibly healthier
healthier which you know always equates
to happier healthier when you're in the
physical presence of women that you
believe could reproduce even if you have
nothing to do with them they could just
be customers or people you work with you
could be your boss could be
anybody look at the yeses the line of
yeses now some of it might be
psychological too you know if if you
feel you're around it you know mentally
maybe that stimulates you as
well um I've always had the fear of
living at a retirement
Village you know what I mean and this
was actually the fear I've never said
this before I had a fear of not being
around people who were capable of
reproduction because I thought it would
affect my body chemistry and my health I
actually thought it would affect my
health so I would say that's not a
proven scientific thing at least not
that I know of but it definitely feels
like it's
true so for what that's
worth uh The Babylon B continues to be
hilarious uh they did a joke where they
showed some uh what looked like uh
ballot boxes installed next to the next
to the Border
fence now it's a real funny picture you
know a bunch of because it's because the
ballot boxes they're like multiple of
them you know as if he would put
multiple ballot boxes right next to each
other other in a line right in front of
the right in front of the fence now
here's the funny part even though in the
age of AI it was really obvious it was
photoshopped or something really obvious
you know because it's a comedy comedy
site they don't really need to hide
anything uh but apparently Reuters
contacted them to find out if the photo
was
real and you get to say to yourself oh I
don't think that could get get any
better get it that feels like a complete
story doesn't
it you know the story is that an
obviously fake picture and Reuters who
was also famous for being fake news uh
couldn't tell the
difference so I'm done with that story
right nothing else to say about
that well it turns out that the
editor-in chief Kyle man uh responded to
Reuters when they asked if it was a real
picture and he said and I quote
um he said to quote we went down to the
border and took that picture so it is
true hope this
helps slow clap slow clap nicely done
Babylon B nicely
done well let's give an update on what I
call World War musk as you know our
government has as a all of government
approach to destroying Elon Musk using
every agency and uh legal and political
tool that they have now we don't know
for we don't know it's
coordinated do we it just seems
coincidental that everybody in the world
and all the news stories are suddenly
negative well here's the story let's see
if you can guess whether this is organic
or part of world war
musk the news says that far-left
extremists have claimed responsibility
for an arson attack on Tesla's Berlin
car
factory and that a 100 militants are
occupying an area next to the factory to
prevent further
construction
maybe maybe there are a hundred people
who decided that the best thing they can
do from their far-left extremist
position is to destroy an electric car
company because that makes sense right
far-left
extremists are going to go after the
single biggest solution in their own
philosophy that you know the world needs
to be saved from climate change so that
that's completely natural nobody paid
them to do that or anything right I
don't know
all right there's no way to know but I
would say in the context of a all of
government approach to destroying Elon
Musk and his businesses that when I see
far-left
extremists trying to burn down a green
technology I do not say to myself that
happened on its own to me that looks
like our our intelligence people getting
to other country's intelligence people
and bribing some Street muscle because
we do know that the most normal thing
intelligence groups do is they
coordinate with bad people to make bad
things happen so they can do what they
need to do behind the scenes so I'm
going to say that the working assumption
is that our own intelligence agencies
are behind that I don't know this is
true I don't have any specific evidence
but within the whole of government
approach to attacking in the world war
musk seems like a logical assumption is
my working assumption does mean it's
true well I've uh come up with a new
meme which is just myself and I'd like
to I'm going to use it a lot today so it
just involves me saying
this com no not
that what well I didn't see that coming
yeah it's what I didn't see that coming
we may have a use for that as I go on
that that's for all the stories where
you go
what I didn't see that coming and you're
all welcome to use it you'll probably
use it a lot let's see if there's
a any stories that that would fit and uh
oh so there's a story that U allegedly a
Chinese National was arrested for
allegedly stealing a bunch of AI secrets
from Google H our most important future
technology stolen by Google the same
week that people are saying you know we
should probably really really increase
our security about this AI if it's
actually so dangerous but it turns out
allegedly that a Chinese National stole
a bunch of AI secrets and I saw a list
of what he might have stolen it is the
good stuff in case you're wondering if
you got stuff like oh I don't know the
phone number list of the company or
something no no it's the good stuff he
got gave it right to China now what
would we say about a story about
that what well I didn't see that
coming the most predictable
story in the entire
world let let me see if I can do another
one I predict
that within the next five
years the pope will say in
public he's opposed to
war yeah yeah you can you can uh you can
set your clock by that One Bank on it
Bank on it that's just the kind of
political prognosticator I am all right
uh let's see have you ever noticed that
the Democrat Party feels like a military
now like they have all these units
military units but it's like a a misfit
Army let me give you some
ideas so if you imagine the Democrats
like a military unit of Misfits they
would have different you know divisions
for different things so some of them are
what I call the hoax
Engineers so there's somebody who comes
up with what's their new hoax right
because they always have a new and that
usually seems to be Hillary have you
noticed that it doesn't become a common
hoax until Hillary says it so Hillary is
apparently the hoax engineer you know
it's like the If This Were regular
military it would be like the core of
engineers who build the bridges and you
build stuff but Hillary builds the
hoaxes and then announces them and then
the people that I call the turd Co
caucus weigh in now the turd caucus are
the people who will say things on
television that even other Democrats
would be too embarrassed to say because
it's so obviously BS so that would be
people like uh you know Raskin and swell
and shiff you it's a longer list but if
you ever see one of those Rasin sww or
Shi they're just members of the turd
caucus so first Hillary Engineers a hoax
and then the turd caucus because they
have no shame whatsoever will say well
that's true it's totally true yep we saw
it ourselves I was in the shift and I
saw it that's totally true that's the
turd caucus
but then another division comes in to
kind of solidify the gains and I call
that the uh send in the clowns division
so the clowns would be the ones who you
literally laugh at because you can't
believe they're even saying it so that
would be like kin John
Pierre when you watch kin John Pierre
don't you actually think
clown now there have been so many memes
about her being a clown that only see
her as a clown now like I see clown
clown clown clown it's like Austin
Powers you know Moly Moly
Moly every second she's on there the
word clown is in my head clown clown
clown looks like it acts like it
couldn't possibly be a serious employee
but I would add to the clowns Morning
Joe have you seen the the latest Morning
Joe where Morning Joe says in his most
passionate passionate voice that Joe
Biden is the most mentally capable he
has ever been in his entire list he
keeps getting better with age and at the
moment he's at his Peak the best he's
the best Biden he's ever
been that's
right Morning Joe looked into the camera
and said that with
passion now you're not going to laugh at
that this one of the funniest things
I've seen you couldn't possibly take
that seriously it's the clowns right how
about the view the ladies of the
view don't they feel like clowns don't
we watch them for
entertainment if you see that the view
is trending it's because they were
clowns always it's always because
they're clowns if you see MSNBC is
trending what's the story going to be
about every time clowns literally on X
if NBC if MSNBC is trending
is because they did something so stupid
that you're going to laugh at it I'm
like oh this is going to be good I
always click on that yeah clowns uh how
about Joy Trump
Reid does she seem like a serious
commentator or does she seem like a
clown she feels like a clown how about
racial
madow yeah racial she's mad now about
racial things does she seem like a
serious commentator at this
point not really she doesn't come across
that way sh so I actually watch M MSNBC
for the laughs and that's not a
joke is anybody else got to that point
where you can watch it just because you
know it's
funny you're not there yet you're still
disgusted
right do you I think you can get there
I'm going to try to get you there so you
can enjoy it it it's disgusting if
you're feeling it for its effects on
society which are negative but once you
realize that they're
clowns then you can kind of enjoy
it all right what about the uh if they
were a military the Democrats wouldn't
they need some kind of military
intelligence well they got one I'd say
brenen and Clapper act as sort of the
you know the lead of the whatever the
intelligence connection is to the news
so they've got their own Spooks what are
Street muscle you're going to need some
muscle if you're
military well they did have black lives
matter and antifa and they will have
whatever new people they're paying for
this cycle maybe they'll get some of
those German extremists they may already
be in the
payroll so they got Street muscle like a
good military then they've got the uh
the Soros Banker uh so Soros can get um
a bunch of local Das elected so they can
create kangaroo courts to lock up the
denters for example Blaze journalist
Steve
Baker um he's being locked up by the
Soros prosecutors I think for simply
just existing and uh covering an event
on January 6 no indication he did
anything illegal he was just there
covering it so the Soros prosecutors
kangaroo court that are part of the
Democrat Army are looking to put him
away um and then there's the the media
coverup crew so I would say that would
be like CNN Washington Post AOS and uh
MSNBC is more of a clown clown car but
the ones who act serious would be like
CNN Washington
Post now on once you see all the
entities of their of their basically
military operation it's it's kind of
well organized they also have like
Special Forces the special forces would
be like the ADL or the splc or these
these Watchdog groups that are
completely illegitimate and basically
operate as a you know paramilitary for
the Democrats and the the
NGS you know that they all they all
operate like Special Forces yeah so
that's what they got going on over
there um let's see what Rachel Rachel
mad now said she's so
MSNBC uh made the terrible mistake of
airing Trump's um victory speech after
on super Tuesday did anybody watch that
so I happened to be watching it live
when they cut to a speech and I thought
oh when are they going to turn this off
they're not going to let him talk and he
he starts just going after the fake
news and and they had to they had to
actually air Trump telling MSNBC see
their viewers were watching fake news
basically I mean not by name but that's
basically what he was saying and they
they kept it on but when they came back
uh racial bad now had to tell the tell
the viewers that it's irresponsible of
news organizations to carry former carry
Trump's remarks when they know he's
going to make false
statements think about that
standard the standard is you can't put
somebody on when you know he's going to
make false statements because they're
they're a news
business now how is that not
comedy that's pure comedy you can't take
that
seriously she actually tried to convince
her viewers that the other stuff they
put in the air is true it was only the
other day they had somebody on literally
in person in the studio uh trying to
tell the fine people hoax I wish I knew
the name of the republ Republican who
slapped him down it was really fun to
watch so um they MSNBC I think it was
yesterday made the mistake of putting a
Haley supporter on the air assuming that
a Haley supporter would say bad things
about Trump right that's a pretty good
assumption but it turns out that the
Haley supporter was nothing but a good
Republican and when I say good
Republican I mean when they said you
know so are you going to say bad things
about Trump or
whatever he said you know what I'm just
going to work for Republican Senators to
get them elected I preferred you know I
preferred Haley but you know I'm not
going to pick a basically I'm not going
to vote for a Democrat so he wouldn't
say anything bad about Trump even though
it very clearly wasn't his first choice
that's what I call a real Republican
that's a real Republican I don't mind
whatsoever that he had a different
preference that's that should not be my
concern
and then the the there was some lefties
sitting next to him on the panel well
two people panel and that guy tries to
interject as he's talking the fine
people hoax and the Republican guy I
wish I knew his name you should tell me
his name if you know who it is he just
stops and he takes a moment to debunk
the fine people hoax while the host sits
there after he debunks it saying well it
was taken out of context he was talking
about the other people people the the
guy who claimed it sat there in
silence like he' never heard that
before like he'd never heard that that
was taken out of context and the
host didn't push back on the claim that
was the primary Biden
claim the primary Biden claim for the
entire last election was a hoax and
there's a guy on their Network who's
calling out the hoax and and also
describing how it was done and how you
can look for yourself just look on the
transcript and they just got quiet and
ignored it and and changed the
subject
now what what is raciel mad now say
about their Network airing that hoax day
after day after day well that's the
truth I think they'd say no so if you
watch racial mad now you can only watch
her as a clown have you seen the rapid
eye blinking she does when she lies so
some of the people are doing the wide
eyye lying but uh I don't think racial
mad now does that she does the
blinking so so for those of you watching
in
video she'll say stuff like uh the sky
is
blue um water is
wet president Trump did an
Insurrection on January 6 everybody
knows it it's just obvious everybody
knows it you should be
jail yeah you have to watch it when when
you look for the eye blinking it's crazy
now if you really want to do a dirty
trick you want to know a trump dirty
trick oh this one's good do you remember
when he was uh debating uh Marco
Rubio and he said that Marco Rubio kept
sweating do you remember that he kept
sweating
now that is trash talk and that gets in
your head so he made Marco Rubio worry
about sweating while he was trying to
debate which is one of the most
diabolically clever trash talky you'll
ever do it's not regular trash talk it's
a trash talk that gets in your head
while you're performing that's a whole
different level than if he just said
some bad things about so now so now he's
got to worry
about how he
looks if you want if you want to take ra
Rachel bad now completely off the air
with the same dirty trick just point out
that she blinks too hard when she
lies it's game
over it's totally game over yeah
Blinky because I don't think she can
control it I don't think I think it's
involuntary I think she can't control
the blinking and I was watching to see
if she blinks all the time and she
really doesn't she does it when she's
lying it's very it's hilarious when you
watch it
anyway uh so Karin jeanpierre their
resident clown uh declined to say
whether Biden will debate and she got
into a back and forth with Steve Ducey
trying to be cute and she just said you
know I I keep telling you that's a
question for the
campaign well as I've said clearly
many times Steve Ducey that really is
something you should ask the campaign do
you know what I heard now I'm just
speculating and reading her mind which
nobody can do but let me tell you how it
came
across oh Peter duy sorry Peter duy uh
the way it came
across is uh that she really really
hates the campaign and really really
hates the staff and really hates Biden
that's what I heard did anybody else he
it in her her inability to do the most
basic part of her job which is to say of
course the president will
debate don't you think that's the most
basic part of her job of course the
president will debate he's in great
shape of course he will just think about
it the his the president's own
spokesperson was not allowed to say of
course he'll
debate she wasn't allowed how much does
she hate her job
today
right imagine how mad she is at her own
team that would send her out there
completely naked in front of the
world and make her try to figure out
what to do about that oh my God she must
hate them and I could pick it up in her
attitude could you now again I'm
probably just imagining it you know CU
you can't read mines but boy did she
look like she hates them that's what I
saw all right um uh as you know Elon
Musk has that lawsuit against open AI
because they said they were going to be
open and everybody could see their work
but then they became a uh closed entity
for profit now open AI does have an
argument and some documentation to show
that maybe that wasn't the biggest
surprise in the world but Elon Musk has
a different opinion and uh in his back
and forth with Sam mman said that he
would drop the lawsuit against open I
open AI if they change their name to
closed
AI now there's not a single other person
in the universe that I would believe if
he said
that right I actually believe he's dead
serious and that he would withdraw his
bazillion dollar lawsuit you know world
changing lawsuit they'll just change the
name so that he can be
right CU he probably doesn't want to be
in a
lawsuit you know the last thing he wants
to do is be in a lawsuit nobody wants
that so he's probably thinking you know
what if I can get them to change their
name I'll win
something now that's hilarious now you
know they're not going to change the
name so it's not really possible so he
can put that out there as a serious
offer and they have the CH they're going
to have the choice
of spending probably $50 million
defending
it or possibly losing what if they lose
what if he
wins that's a really big risk because
you know even if you say the odds have
been winning are
5% that's 5% of a trillion dollars
because that might be the value of the
company right that's how much they would
have to mentally expend is 5% of a
trillion dollars
just to find out if they're going to win
or they could change their name to
closed AI it's pretty
funny well New York City is being
militarized um the governor is putting
the national guard down and what where
it is National Guard as well as whole
bunch of State Police into the subway
city of New York City because there's a
massive Spike and violent crime that's
what the governor of New York is doing
so so while the governor of New York is
putting massive National Guard and State
Police into the Subway because of the
massive spike in crime violent crime at
the same time at exactly the same
time the mayor of New York is posting on
X that murders are down shootings are
down transit crime which is what this
would be is down car thefts are down he
says it's the safest big city in America
and it just got
safer how do you explain
that Well turns out there is an
explanation no the the yeah we'll get to
the conspiracy theory Parts but there's
actually an ordinary explanation too
we'll get to the martial law theory but
how is
it that that smart people could not know
whether a violent crime is going up or
going down let me ask you do you think
that the experts know one way or the
other do you think they know is crime
going up or is crime going
down do you think they
know turns out they don't know turns out
there's no reliable data about
crime I found that out this
morning thank you uh Owen uh for that
but here's what we
know um and you can see it in my um in
my feed I just posted it before I got on
here but there's a long article that
talks about there are two different
sources of crime
data and they don't
agree One Source says it's going up One
Source says it's going down and the
experts seem to agree on this they don't
know which one is
right is that
amazing yeah so enen Gregorian thank you
for that note because that was exactly
what I was asking I was asking do we
even know may maybe there's nothing we
know
anymore so it turns out uh that uh and
this is from the article the conflicting
signals from our major statistical
systems for measuring crime means we
cannot conclude with confidence whether
violent crime other than homicide went
up or down in 2022
think about that that we don't know if
violent crime except for homicide went
up or
down I mean
wow now who was it who sniffed that out
first I
did you could tell by the
atmosphere that the experts didn't know
if crime was going up or down and
actually that was the truth it turns out
that's literally what's happening we
actually don't know
now if you live in one of these
cities do you know if you live in New
York City do you know if crime is going
up or
down pretty sure you do if you live in
San Francisco do you know if crime is
going up or down pretty sure you
do so we could you can just ignore all
the data it's exactly what it looks
like you know I wonder what the crime
stats are for my own neighborhood I can
tell you for sure crime has going up in
my town I mean obviously I mean the ones
I've heard about you know my neighbors
have been hit twice two of my close
neighbors have had gang break-ins you
know like organized gang Breakin of
their homes while I was home by the way
while I was home uh literally I could
throw a stone and H the neighbor's house
literally and they were being robbed by
a gang of South American robbers this
has happened twice in the last year two
different neighbors now I can tell you
for sure there's more crime in my
neighborhood and I live in a really safe
neighborhood so if you're living in an
inner city I can't even imagine it's got
to be much
worse all right so some people are
saying hey maybe this is all part of um
some some kind of upcoming uh martial
law or there's a plan to seize power or
there's going to be a
uh what do you call it a fake flag
attack somebody say a fake 911 some of
you think the first one was fake and
false flag yeah so is this part of a
preparing troops for a false
flag I'm gonna say no you know what I
think it
is I think it's literally this data
problem I think the governor is
completely aware that there's a rise in
crime so she's s in a bunch of uh people
to try to Tampa down down and I think
the mayor looked at the statistics which
are maybe BS and said oh I don't want
people to stop comeing into my City
because I think it's unfair so I think
the mayor is doing his good mayor job by
telling you it's safe to come visit
don't move away come visit safe that's
sort of a good mayor job I kind of like
mayor Adams I have to admit for someone
who's you know uh has some opposing
point of you I feel like he's a solid
person do you get that feeling like I
think he's doing the best he can in a
system that doesn't really give him the
powers he'd like to have so he very
unlike you know like the crazy wi ey
people you see that just seem in TDS he
does not seem like he's suffering from
TDS he looks like he's a capable guy in
a hard job so even when maybe I don't
like what he's doing I still give him a
a lot of respect I feel like he's a
solid
human um
anyway so I think maybe that's just the
whole story but let's worry about the uh
other stuff so the state of the union is
tonight I call it the hate of the Union
because Biden's going to be telling us
he hates part of the country you know
he's going to tell you how much he hates
Republicans and that you should hate
them too so it's the hate of the Union
the hate of the
union and apparently the workers are
putting up uh fence protective fences
around the area where that will
happen and that makes people think oh no
what do you know that we don't know I
don't know I feel like it's just
normal kind of normal
stuff does it scare you that they're
putting up a protective fence around the
State of the Union they they might have
some
indication they on do do you think it's
a reaction to the Border being open and
a lot more Intel chatter about a problem
do you think that the number one target
of all terrorists would be the State of
the Union of course it would the state
of the union is the number one
target do you know how I know that I
watch Game of
Thrones yeah if you watch Game of
Thrones you know this is the ideal time
to put secret Dynamite underneath the
basement of the capital and blow it all
up with the important people are there
so I learned that from Game of Thrones
and also Tom glancy too I guess so it
makes sense that they would put a little
extra security there that just makes
sense under the consideration does it
mean that they're preparing are they
preparing for martial law I don't think
so because I don't think that they could
get this many uh like law enforcement
people to just turn into Hitler's you
know
Stormtroopers I think they'd have to do
a lot more to get people to turn on
their own people in America could happen
someday I don't know well I like to
announce that the mole is back the mole
how many of you remember the
mole is that ring a bell back in
2016 just for fun I started the kind of
imaginary idea that there's somebody I
would call the mole not a real person
but it was uh the go-to whenever
Hillary's campaign did something that
was so stupid they you think her
advisers must be toying with her or
playing a prank on her and so that so
Biden is starting to do things that
looked like it might be a prank played
on him by an advisor so when he did when
he did the shrink flation thing and made
a big deal about not having enough chips
and cookies that's the mole because you
can't imagine that David Axelrod said
you know D you know David Axelrod famous
Democrat
adviser you can't imagine any scenario
where David Axelrod sat with a
campaigner bid and said you know what
I've got an idea has anybody talked
about the lack of chips in the bag yet
because I think the Americans are really
really caring about that right now and
you can make them forget about the
inflation
if you blame the potato chips and the
cookies do you think David Axel advise
that anybody does anybody think that was
advised no most likely it came from
Biden himself and his staff
said
whatever because they don't like him
either do you know how much his staff
much must hate him by now so the fact
that they allowed him to go forward they
allowed him and I do mean allowed they
allowed him to go forward that with that
two two few
chips that sounds like the mole there's
no way that could be possibly serious
that is a practical joke on Biden by his
staff somebody hates that guy here's
another one we're told that he's going
to talk about raising taxes uh on
corporations during the State of the
Union
do you know what would be the very worst
time to suggest raising taxes on anybody
including
corporations the State of the Union the
worst
time the very worst
time and he's apparently he's going to
do it that sounds like the
mole yeah yeah read my lips it's a bad
time to do it just don't talk about
it anyway um apparently he's going to be
appealing to people who don't understand
economics as
usual uh there's a weird story that
Tucker Carlson has up on his site now in
video this uh psychiatrist named Dr
Keith ablo who you might recognize
because he's often on Fox
News so hold this in your head if you
can hold these two thoughts he's a
psychiatrist who is associated most with
Fox News at least public
and it turns out that one of his
patients was Hunter
Biden
[Laughter]
what now as he explains when it comes
down to your health people just look for
whoever can help them it's not really
political so apparently he he knew very
well Hunter as a patient so I guess it's
he's allowed to say he was a patient I'm
surprised about that but here's the part
that surprised me armed agents raided
his office office this is the
psychiatrist office and took his patient
records as well as Hunter's
laptop and then never charged the
psychiatrist with a
crime what was that all
about why why did the psychiatrist have
one of Hunter's
laptops how many how many lost laptops
did he have
and and why would they take the patient
records I think you know
why do does this look like a normal
normal government Behavior no this looks
like the Democrat Army sent in some
parts of their military their armed
agents to take some evidence that might
have been embarrassing for the Biden
Administration is probably exactly what
it looks like it's exactly what it looks
like he used his paramilitary Force
to to I mean it's just
amazing I think we're also mind-boggled
by the brazenness of what's Happening we
don't even know what to do it's it's
like actually stuns you into an action
because there just it's so blatant and
so right to your face you just don't
know what to do about
it well here's the hoax uracy update
The hoax ocracy that that we've lived in
we basically live in a in a hoax um
Society is uh let's see the co-founder
of the uh this group that's concerned
about voter
suppression um says that uh I think
black women in particular she says we're
living in a moment where we've seen that
we believe we live in Fair elections but
we don't oh huh there's a demonrat says
we don't live in Fair elections uh I may
have power but someone who's stealing my
vote or suppressing my vote has to
probably have some correlations to that
she said so basically Democrats believe
there's something called voter
suppression happening and that it is uh
taking away their rights can you fill me
in on the voter
suppression that I've never heard of
what exactly would be the voter
suppression I can't think of anything
now to you just need no
ID and you need to be
breathing I
think how how easy is it to
vote there there's literally nothing in
Civilization that's easier than voting
it's the only thing that everybody wants
you to
do right you know there might be
somebody some you bad person somewhere
who's trying to suppress some votes but
I've never seen it I've never seen it in
in effect or policy or
outcome and and if my neighbor is
suppressed in their vote i' help like I
don't want anybody suppressed in their
vote anyway to me that feels like
another hoax that only applies to
Democrats I don't think there's a single
Republican who believes there's any
voter suppression do you is there even
one person who identifies as
conservative who believes that voter
suppression of the left is
happening
I've never seen any hint of it in any
policy or I've never heard a news story
about it in modern
times all right well maybe that's a
problem with my own news sources you
never know so the new hoax that they're
jinning up according to the news the
hill is reporting this so that uh Biden
is going to talk about in the ha the uh
hate of the Union that um
that Trump Harbors disdain for
Latinos he Harbors
it no
joke they've already told the
news that Biden is going to say he knows
what Trump is thinking in his his secret
inner thoughts and it's bad stuff about
Latinos that's really happening do you
know what I say when I hear that there
might be a new political hoax being
launched for the spring
what well I didn't see that
coming all right so here's what we got
coming uh to look for if you want to
play some drinking games the words to
look for for your drinking game if
you're going to play uh Biden Bingo look
for a chaos
extreme extreme Mega extreme Trump look
for dark and darkness looks for
existential Trump threat look for
dictator for a day and end of democracy
those are the approved scare words so
those are the brainwashing words every
every time you hear a brainwashing word
chaos extreme dark
existential dictator end of democracy or
Insurrection sorry
Insurrection Insurrection should be
added to the
list right but we also expect maybe
he'll highlight some of his uh best of
hoaxes he might come back to the
insurrection hoax the fine people hoax
the border is closed hoax the Trump is a
Putin Papa hoax uh and of course he's
introducing the Latino uh secret disdain
hoax the totally secret mental disdain
for people that Biden can detect with
his dementia
Powers uh Carpe Dum reminds me that I
forgot something uh you should also look
for a creepy
Whispering look for a creepy whispering
so that could be on your bingo card too
if he does a creepy whisper you know
what that's about right inflation is
down to zero because of everything Biden
did you know creepy
Whispering you should also look for
MSNBC to give him breathless
praise um I swear you have to watch M
MSNBC the moment this the hate of the
Union is over go right to
and I want to give you a preview of what
that's going to look
like some of the probable highlights
will
be there's no way that Trump could have
pulled off a performance like that my
goodness did you see the mental alacrity
the capability of that man I could feel
the power of his brain pulsing through
the screen I've never seen a person so
capable he's the best Biden there's ever
been he's at the top of his powers man
there's where experience counts imagine
Trump going up there and bumbling
through it it would have been a a
nightmare but Biden he just powered
through it you could feel the strength
and the conviction in his
voice um I think they'll also say that
uh Biden was shooting golden shafts of
Truth out of his eyes and contrast with
the big old liar called
Trump um and the economy is really
taking off Biden's going to say and he's
going to say the reason for the economy
is miscellaneous things that you haven't
noticed miscellaneous things he did that
you haven't noticed are making the
economy
Zoom all
right what well I didn't see that coming
well I introduced you today the killer
persuasion that uh can destroy the
entire Democratic party and all it
stands for should you like to use it and
I call it the levels of awareness in
politics now here's the important part
if you are at a different level in
understanding than the people you're
debating with it is a waste of time it
would be like a monkey arguing with a
potato I don't know if you're the potato
or the monkey in this example you could
be the monkey or the potato but my point
is a potato and a monkey do not have the
same understanding of the world and if
they try to having a debate well it's
going to look like nonsense to the rest
of us why is that monkey debating a
potato and why is a
potato why does a potato have eyes I
you'd have many questions about
it but here's level one and I'll go
through the levels so you know not to
argue with somebody who's not at least
on your level level one is they believe
that their preferred news sources say
they believe what their preferred news
sources say and they do not sample other
sources so they're not aware of any
counterarguments um and they're not
aware that their own news is mostly just
narrative now that would apply to my
what I call my smartest Democrat
friend who literally gets his news from
CNN and the New York Times and believes
that reading anything else would just be
um garbage
he's he's a level one political um
thinker level two you do sample newses
for multiple sources so not just your
preferred but you see what the other
side says um but you still believe that
your source is the right
one and you believe that the other side
is full of narrative but yours is just
is just singing the truth oh it's good
it's a good thing that my news sources
are telling me the truth all the time
that' be level two so you're familiar
with the other side but you you don't
give it much respect because you think
it's all
fake level three you're aware that all
news is fake at least at least in terms
of missing context right they might be
true facts but an a context so that
you're you're intentionally
misled uh this would also be known as
the Gilman Amnesia now Gilman you've
heard this too many times a famous
physicist who noticed that when he read
the news if he saw saw story in his
field of expertise which was physics he
knew immediately that the story was
wrong because he knew what was right but
then he would say he would turn the page
read a story in a domain in which he was
not an expert and he would say well
that's probably
true but after doing it long enough he
said to himself what are the odds that
100% of the time I read something I know
about it is wrong but all the other
stories are
correct and so so from that he
generalized correctly that all the
stories are
fake it's just that some people know
because they're experts and most people
don't so that would be level three where
you realize all all news is fake at
least in terms of context that's left
out level four you go beyond the news is
fake and all the way to the experts
which are giving the information to the
news are unreliable some might be right
I'm not saying that every expert's wrong
about everything sometimes they're right
often they're right but you can't tell
that's the problem the problem is
thinking you could
tell if you think you can tell you're at
a lower level of
awareness um so level four you know that
the experts uh none of the experts are
reliable because money distorts
everything and you know you might never
see anybody who thought they would lose
their job if they said
something
unpopular level five is where you start
to see the gears of the machine and I'm
going to call it Mike Ben's style now if
you don't know who Mike Benz is it's
probably proof that you also don't know
what the gears of the machine are or
even what I'm talking about because
you're not there yet what I'm talking
about is the fact that we don't live in
a republic and haven't for a long time
and that the real powers are running
things are some combination of in uh
current and ex intelligence
professionals and some combination of
billionaires and they largely control
all the important decisions that have to
do with you know the big stuff the the
world and uh other countries and wars
and stuff like that now I do think our
government is in charge of stuff like I
don't know abortion you know the local
stuff but all the big stuff the big
money stuff the foreign stuff the war
stuff uh that clearly we've been under
some other kind of administration for a
long time so once you really see all the
gears of the machine and you know who's
actually in power and you know it's some
combination of intelligence officials
then you're in level five and then
there's only one level above level five
it's level six and level six you're dead
uh because you knew too much and this is
also known as the Epstein level level
six so Epstein was a level six he
actually knew everything so of course
he's dead he had to
die so those are your levels now the way
you would use this as a sword of
persuasion is to make it a
Thing If you repeat it and post it then
you can simply dismiss people at lower
levels as uh not ready to debate not
inferior they're not inferior because we
were all all level one at one
point they're simply people who have not
yet traveled the path right they're not
they're not
stupid they're not even well there might
be some ignorance that's part of the
process but they're not
defective don't think that there's
something wrong with people who are at a
different level nothing like that
they're also not dumb which is a real
surprising part they're definitely not
dumb my my Democrat friend I always talk
about he one of the smartest people I
know like you wouldn't want to take an
IQ test compete against them ever you
would not want to do that he's smarter
than me you know if we if we both took a
standardized test he'd beat me easily uh
so it's not about
smart it's just where you are on the
journey and maybe you don't care to make
the journey maybe it's just never
something never occurred to you you know
maybe there's something that never
happened to you accidentally that caused
you to you know want to look into it
farther
further but uh that will end uh all of
your disagreements you'll just say
sounds like you're a level three and uh
get back to me when you're a level
four all right
um so here's H this is another Owen
Gregorian uh post I
saw uh apparently the Washington Post
economics colonist is talking about some
economic study and is not capable of
reading the cross tabs on the study that
she's writing about and so in other
words is just describing the study wrong
while the study is actually published in
the same article so you can actually
look at the
study and look at what the expert says
about it oh it's a poll it's it's a poll
not a study so it's based on a poll not
a study and but you can look look at the
poll and you can look at the cross tabs
and you could see that the
interpretation doesn't match the cross
tabs
now what level is
that once you realize that the news is
fake you're you're not there yet you
have to also realize that the experts
are not reliable it's not just the news
it's what they where they're getting
their information from is just as
bad
uh here's uh rasmason did a poll on uh
well let me just tell you here's the
result 52% of likely us voters believe
it's likely that us intelligence
agencies are seeking to control the
outcome of the 2024 presidential
election let me just read that
again 52% of people are going to vote
so that includes Democrats and
Republicans I don't know the mix here um
52% think it's likely we don't live in a
republic just think about that because
if if we lived in a republic this
wouldn't be happening but if the
intelligence agencies can determine who
wins the
election well I don't I don't know what
we are we're like a federal aren't we a
federally a federal democratic Republic
or something there's a bigger name to
the Republic we're a federal republic
but I think there's one other word in
there what's the third word we're a
federal something Republic right a con a
federal no a constitutional federal
republic we're a con constitutional
federal republic I believe that's the
official
name but we're definitely not that we
haven't been that for a while so 52% of
likely us voters are susp supicious
um let's see how many people don't think
that's the
case good
guess whenever it's less than 25% you
know you have really it's actually less
than
25% so let's see uh oh 38% don't think
intelligence agencies are trying to
control the election but that includes
20% who say it's not at all
likely 20% say it's not at all
likely really let let me tell you what's
likely if you have a government that's
not a dictatorship or maybe even if it
is and you have a gigantic well-funded
entity who are experts at taking over
governments and then you add
time really you don't think it's likely
that you could predict how that's going
to turn out
there's only one way that turns out you
could run that experiment a thousand
 times every time you put those
variables together and the people who
are experts at taking over countries
eventually will own the
country there is not a second way that
can turn out there really
isn't not you can't even imagine one all
you have to do is add time you know
maybe we resist for a year maybe 5 years
maybe we resist for 20 years but
eventually it only goes one way and
apparently we're already
there all right
um rasmuson I'm sorry we have another
story here uh apparently Hamas has
pulled down of the um talks about a
securing a
ceasefire turns out that they added some
uh some things they wanted toward the
end they they wanted Israel's commitment
to discuss a permanent stop of the
fighting and so the the temporary
ceasefire broke down huh a ceasefire
broke down in
Gaza what what to think about
that what well I didn't see that
coming so here's what uh here's what
Hamas thinks they're
negotiating maybe if we give all the
hostages back
back they'll let us live and we'll just
reform our army and Carry
On Now who thinks that there who thinks
Israel is going to agree to
that here here's Israel's offer we're
going to kill all of you whether you
give the hostages back or not that's
their only offer we're going to kill
every one of you the fighters not the
not the civilians we're going to kill
every one of you and there's no no
argument about it we're going to kill
every one of you even if you kill all
the
hostages now if you want to ceasefire
because you also care about the
civilians definitely we can talk about
that if you like a ceasefire because
maybe there's a legitimate trade of
prisoners we could talk about that but
we're not going to talk about the
question of whether we're killing every
one of you the people they're
negotiating with they're going to kill
how do you negotiate with somebody you
know is going to kill you no matter what
you do why would you negotiate yeah so
every time I hear that they're on the
brink of a
ceasefire it made sense in the beginning
when there were a lot of
hostages and they both could win but I
think when you get to that last few
dozen
hostages you maybe don't want to give
them back because they're going to have
some stories that you don't want them
telling you know what I mean so yeah no
I don't see a c
coming well here's the most surprising
thing I'm going to say suppose it's true
as all indications suggest that we don't
live in a constitutional federal
republic and we're actually uh run in
large part by our intelligence past and
present um is that
bad here here's the surprise twist
ending is that bad
look at the quality of your uh president
at the moment look at the quality of
your
president do you want that guy making
important decisions about your National
Security I don't I don't but then you
say I no but if it's Trump I do if it's
Trump I do maybe and maybe that's why
he's in great physical risk because he
could take some power because he could
actually maybe do something capable but
here's what I
suspect I suspect that when you become
president there's some meeting in which
they tell you how the real world works
and that takes away all of your
power and they know it and that's why
they do it and when they say this is how
the real world works it's probably some
combination of ensuring them that they
have the goods on them indirectly oh by
the way we do surveil everything and
everybody involved in the political
process we don't like everybody to know
that but we actually know everything
you've ever done for six years imagine a
president learning for the first time
that his own intelligence agency already
knows all of his secrets that have never
come out in the news or anywhere else
they don't have to threaten
them that is a threat they just have to
indicate that they always have more
information than the news reports that's
it and then you're afraid of
them then they say I'm just speculating
but it seems logical in the real world
they say something like this look we can
never tell the voters everything that's
happening because if we did they would
resist and they're not smart enough to
know how things work in the real
world sometimes we have to do horrible
horrible things that even involve deaths
of innocent
Americans and if we put it up to a vote
would say no no you can't kill any
American for any reason and therefore we
wouldn't be able to protect
America because it's a dirty dirty ugly
world for
example I'm pretty sure at some point
somebody says to the president we
pretend to fight the cartels but they're
actually on our
team because the cartels control the
government of Mexico and there's no way
that we can allow the government of
Mexico to be control controlled by the
um a foreign country so Mexico's
government is so weak that somebody like
me like the Chinese could buy their way
into control and you then you'd end up
with like an enemy on your border so the
only thing we can do and nobody's come
up with a better idea is we partner with
the cartels we tell them they can earn
their money with their drugs and their
their human trafficking but in
return they'll make sure that they keep
China of Mexico now I'm just using China
as the you know bad guy
proxy and in that way by having a
working Partnership of our our Spooks
with their cartels we can not only
assassinate Mexicans we don't like in
case it's somebody who got bought off by
a Chinese somebody that that sort of
thing uh but we can also control the
government we just can't say it in
public so I think that's why we don't go
after fentel in any way that looks
serious that's why I think that no
Republican will use the military in
Mexico remember every every candidate
said oh we'll definitely use the
military in Mexico aake said it Trump
said it Des Santa said it we're not
going to use the military in Mexico that
my current understanding is that the
cartel is on our team it's the only
thing that makes
sense it's the only thing that makes
sense and you know what's weird about it
you know you all know my story you know
my stepson died of a fenal overdose and
so since that moment I've been
radical about doing whatever it takes to
make that stop or to make the people
doing it pay for
it I now I now realize that it's a
conscious tradeoff that's my current
working understanding I could be wrong
but it's my working
assumption and believe it or not it
makes me feel better about the tragic
loss of my own
stepson because I feel now he's part of
a war a war
victim you know certainly he was
addicted to drugs and and that was the
approximate cause of his death
but I believe he's just part of the war
and I believe that there's a conscious
decision to kill 100,000 Americans and
that I think the CIA thinks those are
The
Expendables literally I I think that
this and by the way a lot of you say it
too when I talk about my stepson dying
of fenel do you know half of you say
good yeah people say that to me every
day good we won't miss them get rid of
the
druggies did you know your fellow humans
are that bad I hear that every day every
day on social media if if the topic
comes up only if the topic comes up
somebody tells me that um the people
like my stepson are basically nobody's
going to miss them and it's their own
damn fault and nobody cares about
addicts I believe that is the attitude
of our government at least the the
military industrial part of it I believe
that they literally don't care about
that
population and their reasons would
be
coldly
militarily
horribly
Justified meaning that their argument
isn't
stupid it might be evil definitely
evil but it's not
stupid and it doesn't mean it doesn't
work and it doesn't mean it's not
keeping you
safer unless you have a stepson who
takes you know pills um so I have a very
mixed feeling about it I actually think
that our overlords probably are you know
making profits certainly finding ways to
profit personally
but they might actually have a better
handle on what's keeping you safe than
you and I do because they're working
with a completely different set of
information they know what's real you
and I don't know what's real so it's
hard to judge that they're doing their
job or not doing their job but my
working assumption is that um if you
want to protect yourself from Fen
you got to do it
yourself I don't believe the government
has any role except pretend you know we
we pick up gigantic batches of fentanyl
but nobody pretends that makes a
difference because they can make
fentanyl in unlimited amounts so you
just ship more there's no difference
maybe the price goes up for a
week
so I'm
confused I actually don't know if I
should complain about this situation or
if it's a situation that has been
keeping America safe for over 50 years
my best guess is that this exact
situation has been the case for over 50
years maybe at least since Eisenhower's
time and that there might not be a
better
system it's completely
evil but it doesn't mean it doesn't
work right doesn't mean it doesn't
work
so
that ladies and
gentlemen is the best podcast you've
ever seen and tonight I'll be watching
the ha of the union with you and we'll
all have a good laugh I I swear you have
to go immediately to MSNBC to see the
clown show as soon as it's done it's
going to be really good this time and
watching Biden try to read the
teleprompter without dementia anger is
going to be fun because he's also going
to have dementia
anger
Trumper yep I would also look for him to
try to
avoid calling a third of the country
deplorables in different words um and
fail I'll bet you he will fail to make
it political or just about Trump he's
going to he's going to bring in the
magga if he uses the word
magga I got a problem with that I got a
big problem with that all right so
that's all we got for now um hope I
don't make it to level six and hope you
don't either and thanks for joining all
of you on the xplatform and Rumble and
the racist YouTube platform I will see
you same time tomorrow thanks for
joining
