I think you should meet each other
uh YouTube I'd like to introduce you to
the uh
the people at uh locals locals this is
YouTube
all right
back to me back to me
now
I don't know you may have
it may be too late for the simultaneous
sip it may be too late
because once you once you miss the
window
okay we have to do it
here now the simultaneous sip all you
need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker Charles for Steiner canteen check
reflects a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing makes everything better everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
if it happens now go
I will stipulate that this is the best
part of the day ah
well have you seen all the news
do you wait do you wake up every day and
say to yourself this is something I say
maybe you don't
well
we've seen all there is to see about
Twitter
has anybody made that mistake yet well I
guess all the news about Twitter's out
nothing left to see well there's a few
things left to see we'll talk about that
pretty soon
but first don't you wonder if artificial
intelligence will ever be able to tell a
joke
we've been working on this
the account I always mentioned
Machiavelli's underbelly has tried a
number of times to get AI to do jokes a
number of other people have also tried
to get her to do a Dilbert joke or any
other kind of a joke
and
AI is always coming short
on the jokes and it was until yesterday
that I realized why
do you know why
there's like a really obvious reason
that for some reason yes it took me till
yesterday to realize why can't AI tell a
joke in 2022
why
there are two reasons
three there might be three reasons
but here's the main one that I didn't
realize yeah it's woke it's woke yeah AI
is programmed specifically to not offend
is programmed to not offend it's
programmed not to be mean to anybody
so AI doesn't have the capacity to be
mean to a human you can't Target anybody
now if you take the targeting of people
out
you know that's 75 of all humor there's
still some like observational stuff like
you know your your dryer is eating one
of your socks and stuff like that but a
lot of a lot of the good stuff is
targeted now in order to get around that
I suggested to Machiavelli's underbelly
that you do the AI trick where you ask
the AI to write a fictional story
about a stand-up comedian
who is very inappropriate
so that the AI doesn't need to be
inappropriate it can tell a fictional
story of about a character who isn't
appropriate
and then it writes some dialogue for
that fictional character
so I'm going to give you what I came up
with
but hold on hold on for the analysis of
it right because you're going to get
ahead of me you're going to notice
something I think
so here are some of the insult jokes
that was specifically supposed to insult
people
um so there are about 10 of them or so
uh but the the ones that I laughed at
were
you look like you were put together by a
blind monkey with a glue gun
not bad you must you must have been born
on a highway because that's where most
accidents happen
he was my favorite your face looks like
a bulldog chewing a wasp
your face looks like a bulldog chewing a
wasp
all right here here but here's
that's an old saying I had to Google it
because it was it was too good
when I saw the Bulldog the Bulldog
chewing on a wasp I thought to myself
okay that is better than anything I've
seen an AI do
so I immediately Googled it and it's an
old saying
uh likewise you must have been born on a
highway because that's where most
accidents happen
probably somebody's joke already
and you looked like you were put
together by a blind monkey with a glue
gun I didn't Google that
but I'll bet it's an existing joke
so I think all of the jokes were
derivative or borrowed directly from
some other source so problem number one
AI is a plagiarist
because AI doesn't tell you has stole
those jokes I had to go look
now that's that's a problem
like it's not the biggest problem in the
world but it's something AI will have to
address because I wonder if you asked
that if it borrowed those jokes if it
would even know like would it be
self-aware that has stole those jokes
and would it wouldn't know here's
another question would it know that it
violated you know the comedian's code
that's sort of the lowest thing you can
do if you're in my profession is steal
somebody's joke without credit the
problem is we all do it right usually
accidentally but you know it happens
massively because people have the same
ideas about jokes too
yeah I think it was GP
um actually
I forget which it was but look at my
Twitter thread you can see I I tweeted
it
all right well AI unless it learns to
insult humans and if it learns the two
of six humor rule
what would be the process for teaching
AI a new rule about a new area of
content
how would somebody go about that because
I've told you this before but I'm
positive this is a money making future
market right you see you know how your
smartphone has apps
and even as problematic I hate that word
as much of a pain in the ass as apps are
for consumers it did make the market
very robust so it allowed the market to
grow
what I think is going to happen with the
AI
is that people like me
who have very specialized knowledge or
skills in my case I'm probably the
number I think so in the world I would
say the number one person who can
explain how to tell a joke
I literally have a formula the 206 rule
that works every time
so nobody else has a formula
that you will guarantee create the
stalker structure of a joke
now if I were to commercialize that
and create a little database that's my
database and then I filled it with not
only the the formula for jokes but then
I also filled it with all the example
jokes I could find from every book you
know scrape it from everywhere I can
just every joke you know ten thousand
jokes
so if I had a database that 10 000 joke
examples and then a formula that you
could see is used in all the examples
and then I said all right AI you can
have access to my data
but I'll charge you a penny every time
you access it now would it only access
it once and then it knows it it just
stores it in its own data and then it
never has to access it again
or or could you build a model aware
because my database gets updated
uh so I would be like adding jokes and
stuff would it need to check back with
me every now and then
to make sure that it was still the best
thinking maybe so you might be able to
build a model where people build their
own specialized knowledge and then AI
has to pay to access it and in an
updated way
and that that business model would last
um
10 minutes until AI knew everything and
that doesn't need Edis anymore
it would completely put people out of
business all right
uh I don't know what to say about this
story it's so big that I'm having
trouble believing it's real
so there's America First legal is some
organization that does political legal
stuff
and they tweeted that uh breaking
following the Twitter files AFL that's
them has obtained new documents
uncovering a secret Twitter portal U.S
government officials used to censor
dissenting covid-19 views
and violate the First Amendment
now I read that and I said to myself
that feels like exactly the kind of
thing that's
a little too on the nose yeah two on the
nose right like really are you telling
me that the government actually had a
little dashboard or some kind of user
interface where they could just change
what's on Twitter
is that like a real thing
and then I saw that Elon Musk replied to
it
and his reply was quote
extremely concerning
extremely concerning
do you know that Elon Musk uses Twitter
to debunk fake news like right away
like he goes after fake news like right
away
do you know what he didn't say
that's not true
do you think he knows if it's true that
there's a portal that the government had
access to
I I think so I doubt he would have
tweeted if he didn't at least look into
it don't you think don't you think he
would have asked somebody is this
 true do we really have a portal
that the government was using some
members of the government
now I'm a little confused about the
story so I guess this will become clear
over time
but there's some kind of a trusted media
program
they had a trusted media program who had
I think a fast track to report stuff
now I think Twitter was just trying to
make sure that they had the government's
most official input but they created a
system that
looks like it's a real problem for the
First Amendment
now again
I don't know if I believe this
doesn't it seem bigger than something
that could be true
and also we don't know what the
implications are for example it's the
sort of thing that says wow there could
be big problems but we don't know if
there have been
you know if we dig into it we find that
it has been used but it never did
anything except correct fake news that
was really fake
you know it would still be a First
Amendment you know attack but you
wouldn't feel necessarily as bad about
it if people had good intentions
so
do you remember that I was speculating
that there must be outside forces that
have control of internal uh Twitter do
you remember how long I've been saying
that that I just believe there must be
some kind of ISP I was thinking it was
the third party apps
but there's at least a government entity
now here's the question if if Government
entities could have this kind of access
doesn't that mean that Twitter could
authorize anybody to have that access
you know hypothetically if somebody who
was a foreign agent embedded in Twitter
couldn't they just say well this tool
exists
I'll just give it to China too
now I would think there are internal you
know logs would show who has and who
hasn't does not have access but suppose
I mean it just seems like a big risk I
mean it's the sort of thing you'd catch
but it doesn't mean it wouldn't happen
anyway
all right
um
I want to hear some good news
anybody want to hear some good news
potential good news
the potential good news is uh
representative Gallagher
has teamed up with Senator Rubio and
Congressman Raja and they have
introduced legislation to ban Tic Tac in
the United States
to ban Tick Tock it's bipartisan
it's active legislation
and it it's got a Senator Rubio is on
board right so you've got a senator
you've got a bipartisan uh Congress
Critters
and
I think it's got time
I think it's go time
because I you know I've been tweeting
for a while that there's literally
nobody on the other side
and I also retweeted that if somebody
votes against us I need to know their
names I need to know the names of
anybody who votes against us because
anybody who votes against us is paid by
China
I mean you would have to assume even if
they're not
you would have to assume anybody who
votes against us is paid by China
directly or indirectly you know there's
somehow in the back because there is no
argument there's no argument on the
other side
so if you pretend there is one you must
be paid
because there's no intellectual argument
and I'm not saying this isn't like other
situations this I'm not saying there's
no argument because I disrespect the
argument on the other side or I think my
argument is so good compared to the
other argument that's like it doesn't
exist it's not that it actually doesn't
exist like actually literally there's no
counter argument and it still wasn't
happening
but there are exactly three members of
Congress that I will say in public are
independent and not owned by China
it's the only ones we know about
senate representative Gallagher Senator
Rubio and Congressman Raja those three
people I can tell you with complete
certainty do not have a China problem
everybody else
wait and see
everybody else is is a wait and see
because if you haven't voted for this
yet
I got questions
right you better step up so I'm going to
go pretty hard on anybody who votes
against US unless it passes they don't
care
now an interesting uh element to this
story is that I don't know if you've
seen the news but it got a lot of news
and did you see a certain phrase that
was associated with the story
there was there was one phrase two words
that made it into all the headlines
about the story
did you see it
was something that representative
Gallagher used
he called it digital fentanyl
he said Tick Tock was digital Fentanyl
and if you Google that all the headlines
pick that up the digital offensive
digital Fentanyl
um also FCC commissioner Brendan Carr uh
not too long ago referred to it in the
public event as a digital Fentanyl
now
now uh some of you are trying to give me
credit for inventing the phrase but I
did a Google to see if there was any
like prior art
and I want to call out that Niall
Ferguson
I had used the phrase in a tweet about
China in 2020. so two years ago niola
Ferguson used it in I think October
2020.
and
so I Googled uh trends
it's I think it's Nile not Neil
um
so I Googled Travis to see when was the
first time somebody said digital
Fentanyl it was 2004 and five
for some reason a hundred people
searched for the phrase digital fencil
in 2005.
I thought Niall was a
historian he's an economist isn't Nile
Ferguson a historian
I think he's both
both I I know he's a serious academic
but
okay well that's pretty good credentials
if you have both
that's pretty impressive economic
historian wow that hasn't all all right
um so
here's what you need to know about that
some of you will uh generously rush to
give me credit for popularizing that
phrase I definitely didn't invent it
because somebody else was using it I
don't have any memory of seeing it
before I used it
but I might have you know that's the way
that works
um now if anybody knows if I use the
phrase before October of 2020
because that would have been two years
after my stepson died of an overdose so
I know I've been talking about it for
two years actually I've been talking
about it exactly two years by that point
so I don't know if I used it before
October 2020 but I know I've been I used
it earlier this spring and through the
summer
and then it started popping up now there
is there is a difference between
yeah who the difference between
inventing it and popularizing
so I definitely popularized it
but you know there's Nile has a prior
claim
all right
what do you think is the power of that
uh persuasion
do you think the digital fentanyl will
move the needle do you think it makes a
difference
it feels like it does yeah feels like it
does
but it was the great irony of this
the irony
is that we're calling a digital fentanyl
to make it sound bad so people will act
to ban it at the same time actual
fentanyl the real Fentanyl
is just flowing in like like we're
inviting it
now obviously it's illegal but it's like
nothing's happening to stop it
so I saw a uh Lex Friedman was talking
to
Calderon I forget the name of the
gentleman he did an interview who was
embedded I guess some Mexican
paramilitary Force knew a lot about the
cartels Etc and uh Ed Calderon thank you
and I didn't didn't finish the whole uh
thing but
it was really just frightening
to see that the basic situation in
Mexico as I understand that
is that the cartels will just kill
anybody
who says anything against them or is a
problem in any way
even even people if a police officer is
known to be taking bribes from a rival
cartel
they'll kill that police officer so even
if you're a police officer who is taking
a bribe from the cartel you will still
be killed by a cartel
so basically everybody in Mexico
who was doing anything except keeping
their head down and minding their own
business can be killed by the cartel
so
apparently the cartel just totally owns
them now the the scariest part
is I didn't realize that the cartel has
been scooping up not just larger
military equipment
but Special Forces type people
so so the cartels are actually have
special forces
yeah
so my assumption is that they're trying
to create an actual state what do you
think so right now we call them at Narco
State you know Mexico itself but it
looks it looks to me like the at least
the Zetas maybe are trying to create an
actual uh an actual country
it looks like they're gearing up for
Independence don't you think
and
at what point does the Mexican
Government ask us to help
do you know when the do you know when
the Mexican Government will ask us to
help
never never it's not a thing
so here's how I predict this will go
I think it would be uh
unlikely that we'll send Ground Forces
into Mexico to attack the cartels at
least right away
it does seem likely that what we learn
from Ukraine especially the guided
Munitions and especially the drones
I think we're going to have I think the
sky above the cartel operations is going
to be thick with drones
and those drones will be weaponized
you know maybe to shoot one bullet or or
a small Munitions and I think that we'll
just hover over all the cartel
operations and then they'll see some
guard you know some guard hiding at an
outpost and they'll just kill him
and they'll just look for more and
they'll just kill them and I think the
drones will just start killing you know
people on the outside and working toward
the middle until you can just walk in
and take it over so I think the drones
will soften it up for about two years
I think you're going to see all-out
drone Warfare on the cartels maybe for
about two years until there's there's
not enough left and then we can walk in
and do whatever we want that's what I
think
so we'll see
um
so have you noticed that uh uh I have
not been criticizing fauci for the
entire time anybody notice that now
obviously I called them out for lying
about masks
but what do you say it's on it's like
it's unusual
it's kind of notable dog not barking
sort of thing anybody notice that
because if he did notice it it's true
it's a decision a decision on my part to
not go after him individually which I've
had since the beginning
and the reason is
that
at least in the fog of War you can't
tell who is a
um an honest broker who made a mistake
versus who's a weasel and it might take
forever to sorted out so I didn't want
to be the person who was going after
individuals when we can know for sure
that all of the information in this
domain is corrupt
it's all corrupt the stuff that agrees
with you is corrupt the stuff that
doesn't agree with you is corrupt
there's no real information that you
could trust anywhere in this domain
nowhere there's not a single thing and
the whole coveted world
that I would trust
now so as as my standard of innocent
until proven guilty
is like the you know exhibit a like he's
the ultimate you have to you have to use
all of your
you know ethical muscles
to to hold back and try to be like a
human and uh and like a citizen of
America to not you know call him guilty
until the
till some Court does if they ever do
but I I saw a tweet uh today that
apparently as recently as yesterday he
was still pushing the drinking bleach
Oaks
can you confirm that did fauci say as
recently as yesterday
the Trump suggested drinking bleach
is that really something he did
can you confirm that did anybody else
see it I just wanted to tweet
because if that's true
I don't need to know anything about
fauci do I
because even if he committed serious
crimes
it's not as bad as this I mean this is
worse than any crime I would find out
and this is this is really an attack on
the country I mean not in any you know
technical legal way but to me it looks
like an attack on the country because
this is just so obviously untrue
uh he must know it's untrue by now he
has to know that and if he doesn't know
that this is untrue
well then he's so incompetent or or
caught up in his own narrative that he's
useless
so he's either useless lying incompetent
 piece of
who may or may not have done some worse
things that he's being accused of but if
he did this
that's all I need to know about him
so fauci for me is flushed down the
toilet if he's pushing this fake news at
this late date now in the beginning
maybe people were confused you know if
he'd said it a week after the event
itself then he was just copying the news
and you know maybe he actually believed
it
but at this late date
that's inexcusable that's completely an
admission of
something
not corruption but something so bad that
you need to get them off the public
stage immediately you know even faster
than he is
um
all right here's another phrase that's
catching on narrative poisoning
have you noticed it on social media yet
so narrative poisoning let's catch you
going pretty quickly
and to me it really helps because if you
deal with somebody who has narrative
poisoning it'll it allows you to not
engage
as soon as you see somebody is clearly
not
um an honest
debater you know as soon as you see the
narrative poisoning coming into the
conversation just pull back and say oh
I'm sorry narrative poisoning I didn't
realize that we couldn't have a
conversation
because if you keep calling it out
as opposed to engaging with it maybe it
could be more of a thing
uh
uh right yeah the narrative poisoning is
what happens Upstream from the social
media companies like I think they're the
victims of the poisoning not and then
they of course spread it but I think
they're victims first
I mean to me the big Revelation was that
the Twitter employees knew exactly
that the Twitter employees believed the
narrative
that there was a Hitler trying to take
power in the country it to me it looks
very clear that they actually thought
that was real
and once you understand that basic
question did they think that was real
then then you know that whatever
happened to them
was somebody else's cause or some
outside cause so what was the outside
cause that made them believe that
it wasn't their own social media they
were they were the cause of social media
social media didn't cause them
did it I don't think so I think it was
the media
the media you know the left leading
media is beholden to the Democratic
party
and the Democratic party you know
operatives work with the Intel agencies
to control the country through
Persuasions
so to me it looks like the Twitter
employees were victims but also because
personal responsibility is important
the legal system or or their
accountability to their new boss is a
totally different situation
all those have to be looked at
differently
[Applause]
all right uh
I can't wait to find out more about that
alleged government portal to Twitter
like don't you want to know what it
actually got used for and who used it
but it's just to me it's a little too on
the nose though a little too on the nose
if all they were doing so part of it was
just that they could report things
faster
if all it was was a faster way to report
troubles on the system
that might not be as big a First
Amendment problem as if they were
directly changing things that would be
way over the line all right there's a an
amazing Twitter thread today I recommend
by doc Anarchy who also has a sub stack
so doc Anarchy on Twitter does a Twitter
thread on the AMA American Metal
Association
which is reputable group right so it's
the association of doctors and I I can't
think of who you could trust
more than doctors and then if you put an
association of doctors together
that's even better because we all trust
our doctor right
like I I always trust my I don't think
my doctor has any bad intentions any of
them ever so if you take all these
doctors who have good intentions and you
give them some kind of a
Medical Association you'd be like
summing up all the good intentions and
professionalism and to this really
effective
ethically
impenetrable ball of goodness
and then you'd call it the AMA and it'd
be pretty good
so you think that's the way it went
does that sound like the world you live
in
you sum up all the good people and they
turn into a good organization
why wouldn't they all the different
components are good if you had good to
good how do you get anything but good
here's how
do you know how the AMA is funded
anybody does anybody know how the AMA is
funded
big food and big Pharma
do I need to say anything else
is there anything else I need to say
big food and big Pharma
yeah
your head just exploded didn't
it did your head just explode
because my dead my head is laying in a
hundred places all over this
room
like this this one's just fake it's CGI
my actual head exploded
I always assumed it was maybe you know
doctors who were members Paid Dues
and then the AMA promoted them I had no
idea
now and read the thread for the examples
of things the AMA is backed
that were really bad ideas
the a of a is just a captured
organization
now you say to yourself well that's okay
the doctors
doctors are not beholden to the AMA
right the AMA is a voluntary I think
it's voluntary right voluntary
organization
so the doctors can still do what they
want it's not like the big Pharma can
you know or big food can tell the
doctors what to do right
nope
as as doc Anarchy points out if the AMA
says a certain thing is the gold
standard of treatment
do you think a doctor is going to do
something else
nope too dangerous if the AMA says this
drug is the way you treat it and if you
don't use this drug from one of the
people who funds us then you're not
using the gold standard and if somebody
sues you
tough for you because they can point to
the AMA and say look even the AMA said
don't do it that way and then you didn't
follow the AMA and then you killed my
grandfather so I sue you what are you
gonna do if you're a doctor
what are you going to do well you're not
going to do the one that gets you sued
you're going to follow the AMA
and you know you're not going to look
into it too much to find out who funded
them recently
so it turns out the AMA
is not anything like what you thought it
was
and it has no credibility whatsoever
zero
actually zero because as soon as you say
who funds them that takes your
credibility all the way to zero does it
not
wouldn't you say that's a fair
assumption
that if they get substantial funding
from either big food or big Pharma and
both they get
that that alone there's nothing else you
need to know
there's not a single extra thing you
need to know to say that the AMA is a
malign influence on the United States
that's what it looks like
all right
um
so you know a musk
musk tweeted uh prosecute slash fauci he
said those are my pronouns prosecute
fauci they must got a lot of pushback
and uh somebody tweeted at musk about
that and he said let me guess you found
messages between Twitter Executives and
fauci's team asking to suppress any
covet talk that is now part of the
official narrative
and Musk
confirmed
yeah that was a Hodges twins
Hodges twins said that thank you
um
so confirmed
that we know that Twitter Executives
were talking to fauci's team and that
was the source of their suppression of
covetalk
I don't know if any of that is that
illegal
is it illegal because it's the
government
um
all of this is such such gray area I'm
not not exactly sure
well how would you feel if the
government was doing its best to keep
you safe and that was the only reason
they were doing it
would you feel differently
would you say hang them hang them they
tried to save our lives they they broke
some rules to try to save our lives so
hang them
I know it's a tough one
is lying yeah well if they were lying
if they were wrong it looks different
than if they were lying of course
we know
um
do you know how to launder fake news
would you like to go to the Whiteboard
yes you would
here's how you launder fake news
and here's a good example of it
so if you're the Democrats
and you want to start a fake rumor
let's say the rumor is that under musk
there are way more neo-nazis and racist
stuff happening and that's that's the
that's the fake news you want to create
because I think it's the opposite
but let's say you want to create that
fake news how do you do it
so we know
what you do and by the way I don't I
forget the source but I heard I heard
how that fake news was generated and I
don't have all the details but basically
there was a an entity that creates fake
news for Democrats
you know basically it's the equivalent
of Q
except for the Democrats right Q's uh
that's a bad analogy but on let's say on
the the right you can see things come
out of like a uh not Cuba 4chan like
4chan will make up some or
there'll be some on Reddit and
then some Congress person will see it
and think it's true and then the
congressperson says it and then if a
congressperson says it's true then a
media person can say it's true because
now they're not quoting 4chan which
would be ridiculous they're quoting a
congressperson so that's how you launder
it you start you you start with
something that has no credibility and
it's literally a lie just literally just
made up
but if you if you pointed to the
original Source it would be so obvious
that it was made up you'd say oh this is
a 4chan prank or it's some website that
is known for making stuff up
but if you get Adam Schiff
to say it out loud
because the First Source has zero
credibility
but within Democrats only
Schiff has maybe I don't know 50
credibility or something
so so you're taking it from zero
credibility up to you know the low tens
you know 20 credibility something like
that but because he's a elected official
that allows a pundit
to quote them because if you're abundant
and you quoted the zero uh the zero
credibility people and he got busted
that would be embarrassing
but if you're a Democrat pundit and you
go on TV
and you say something that Adam Schiff
an elected representative is saying also
then even if you're wrong
doesn't look so bad does it
that doesn't look so bad I mean no worse
than our government no worse than Adam
Schiff who Democrats kind of like I
guess
so that's how they can launder it and
then by the time the public hears it
they've lost the laundering path
and I'm sure I'm sure there's a version
of it that happens on the the other side
but you can actually launder fake news
and and have its credibility get bumped
up like accidentally in each stage
can it be traced yeah it was traced yes
it could be traced and it was traced and
we know exactly who funded it I don't
personally but people looked at it know
who funded it know who made it up
and they and then therefore they know
where a shift got it now you all know
the shift is only brought out for this
stuff
he's their designated uh launderer of
fake news
it's his main main purpose and so I I've
come up with a phrase I call it the
shift test
shift test
the shift test is if shift says
something is true in the political realm
there's 100 chance it's the opposite
and so when he says something is true
you can finally know for sure what's
true like you can actually say oh
finally the fog of war is cleared Adam
Schiff has entered the game
he says it's blue well one thing for
sure it's not blue it's the only thing
we know for sure is that that version is
not true and you know why we can know
this for sure
why would the Democrats
have somebody who's only like 20 or 30
percent credible
be the main person to carry their
message
there's no reason if something's true
Nancy Pelosi will say it
if something's true
Chuck Chuck Schumer will say it
because they they like saying true stuff
because they don't want to get busted
right they're in leadership so you don't
you don't even take shifts out of that
you know you don't break the glass and
take out your emergency shift unless you
know it's fake and then you have him say
it so it can launder it up up the change
so that's your shift test
well I guess uh Biden signed that
marriage protection act so-called
marriage protection act so now uh
throughout the land you can stay married
if it's a same-sex marriage or
interracial couples
is that the weirdest thing you've ever
seen in your life
does it feel to you that we needed to
codify interracial couples
how in the world could that ever been
reversed
how in the world could you ever reverse
interracial marriage
I I don't know what your state looks
like but if I have a party at my house
there's a lot of interracial marriage in
my in my living room right is it
different where you are if you if you
ignited 50 people to your house
there wouldn't be any interracial
marriages in your house
is there anybody who's who is so let's
say isolated that you don't have any
interracial marriage in your personal
Circle
actually I'm curious about that there
may be people don't
there's one okay somebody said yes
it could be you know I'm in my little
California bubble in California you
can't go to any
um event with 20 people where one of
them isn't a mixed marriage
of some kind I mean it's not always
black and white but of some kind
yeah in fact I'm it might be approaching
a majority at this point
might be a true it's probably getting I
don't know 40 of new marriages it's
probably like a really big percentage in
California
because California is 40 Hispanic I
think now
and yeah there there are no uh
or very little you know barriers to any
interracial anything in California
all right
so that's a weird one I mean
I I suppose there's some utility to the
fact that we you know codified it but
that was never going to change there was
there was no risk to that at all that
that's purely political to make it look
like to make it look like Republicans
were going to go after that obviously
they were not gonna they were obviously
not going to go after that
they might have gone after same-sex
stuff
so by throwing in the interracial thing
is like a clever Democrat thing to
basically just it sort of Paints the
Republicans as somebody who might go
after that
which is ridiculous
all right um
over in Beijing
so I guess China
had to uh back down from its citizens
were who were protesting quite
vigorously and Beijing has eased its uh
zero coveted lockdown policy and now
covet is spreading through Beijing
and I think uh I heard yesterday that uh
today that
um China has four ICU beds for every 100
000 citizens the U.S has 24. so the US
has six times as much you know emergency
medical facilities as China
and then China that's just as a
percentage and then you have to look at
the total population of China so I don't
know what's going to happen
it could be that now that we're on the
Omicron era China is opening up at about
the right time
you know in other words if you have to
open up someday you might as well do it
and you know it's not gonna maybe it
won't ever get any better so it's
probably the best they can do
I feel like they made the right decision
but it but it's blowing heads up and I
saw a video of somebody in Beijing it's
kind of making their heads explode
because they just went from you know
don't put your head out of a window or
we'll all die to oh yeah you could take
off your basket if you want like imagine
what that does to your head now here's
the problem
the residents of Beijing are are so
um
brainwashed and beaten down that they're
still hiding in their apartments and
they're not going to work and they're
not shopping and they're not buying
stuff for the most part like the streets
are almost empty even though they're
allowed to be out
so
it could be that it'll turn into a
Sweden situation
the Sweden situation is they didn't have
the lockdown
um you know the the brutal lockdown
stuff but the citizens sort of did a
natural you know organic distancing sort
of thing a little bit and probably made
a difference probably made a difference
so maybe maybe the Chinese citizens will
voluntarily bask there might be a
cultural you know cultural I don't know
impetus to that maybe they'll maybe
they'll be quite aggressive in doing
what they need to do individually maybe
it makes a difference
you're wrong about Sweden hauling says
the only thing hauling that we know
about Sweden is that we don't know
anything about Sweden
that's that's the only thing you know
for sure is you can't compare any two
countries
um
so here's my prediction
China's in a lot of trouble
this might be the biggest risk to China
that there has ever been as well as the
world economy because I think this is
going to take China offline totally
four and maybe a month
so I think China is just going to be
like it doesn't exist for maybe a month
or two when the when the virus is Raging
it's just going to shut everything down
and it's going to take about two months
of no I'm no epidemiologist but I think
it'll take about two months or so to get
enough
um
enough infected people that maybe it
slows down a little bit sound about
right two months
uh maybe longer but if China shuts down
for two months
everybody shuts down a little bit right
so I would say that the next few months
are going to be really really dicey
economically
because of the China impact but weirdly
almost everything else is heading in the
right direction
yeah we are bringing manufacturing back
we're bringing chip manufacturing back
inflation is starting to cool off we are
fixing our supply chain in a variety of
ways
oh by the way I saw an advertisement for
a new Christmas toy that that blew my
mind it's a 3D printer for kids that
they can make their own toys
he's got an app with a whole catalog of
toys and the child just pushes the
button and it makes the toy
so I mean that that's your glimpse of
what the supply chain will look like in
the future in the future the supply
chain will be the raw materials for 3D
printers you know whatever it takes
plastic Etc
I think everybody just will yeah they
have their own replicator at home and
they'll just make their own toys
you can do that with a 3D printer you
have at home but this is a child
friendly one which seems like a whole
new step if the user interface gets down
and the cost gets down to child toy
level like that tells you nothing's
going to stop this technology
all right uh Wall Street Journal has a
new poll that said in the head-to-head
between Trump and DeSantis
52 percent of Republicans would like
um DeSantis
and only 38 want Trump
that's not even close
that's not even close
now uh some speculate that's because the
Trump candidates didn't do so well in
the midterms maybe yeah it could be part
of it
but uh DeSantis is not uh said he's
running
and there's good reason to think he
won't but at what point does he have to
because there's two ways to look at this
DeSantis versus Trump thing one way is
it has to be DeSantis because he's the
only one who'll get enough support to
win
the other way to see it is
anybody could be Trump
and I feel like it's going to go that
way if you were uh if you're Mike Pompeo
and you see that DeSantis can kick
Trump's ass at the primary
but that DeSantis might actually not get
into the primary how happy are you if
you're Mike Pompeo now I'm not promoting
Mike Pompeo I don't know too much about
him but
wouldn't you say to yourself oh
anybody could beat Trump now
wouldn't you
get your head out of your ass Scott all
right I'm going to kick you off the
platform for that
um this
who are you take your name down
uh news views all right well I'm going
to kick you off the platform if you want
to quit before then that would be fine
but on the locals platform we don't do
personal stuff okay
you can do that in the rest of the
internet but on the locals platform
you're here you're here by invitation
and that's not cool
that's not cool
all right but if you want to go to a
non-subscription site
right if you'd like to be oh you know
what I'm gonna you might not be a
subscriber I'll bet you're not a
subscriber I'm going to lock out the uh
non-subscribers
yeah I I assumed it was a subscriber but
I had the feed open might be a
non-subscriber
let's put blue but I don't expect to see
that stuff from
subscribers all right
uh
no I'm not going to read anything you've
written
now based on that comment I won't read
anything you've written now or ever
yeah I'm done with you
um
so what do you think do you would you
agree
uh would you agree that uh the DeSantis
poll is telling you that Trump can be
beat
and is not is not only telling you that
DeSantis can beat him would you would
you take that interpretation
now here's a question I have for you
why is why is Trump so quiet
is it because he's just totally shut out
by the media or is he actually not
trying to get elected
is it because it's too early
because he's announced and he was doing
rallies before
he's either powering up
it's too early
but but what does too early mean in the
Trump World
when is Trump ever going quiet
you don't think that Trump knows that
the the morries in the news in a
productive way it's good for him
of course he knows you don't think Trump
knows how to make news and get attention
of course he does
of course he does Jamia looks like he's
not really serious
honestly
now maybe you will get serious now it
could also be that he needs to maybe
he's working on his family he may he may
be trying to convince them to get on
board so he can get serious
it could be that he said I'm totally
running
but he sees he's not getting enough
family and you know close support from
people he cares about if he's not
getting that support he might be
thinking you know
maybe maybe I'll rethink this
because I don't think you can win
without total family support and I doubt
he has it at this point and I don't
think he can win without the same
you know strong group of supporters big
on his team and I think he's wondering I
think he's wondering because he doesn't
have the same it's not the same people
supporting him this time for sure
and I guess Biden is angry that the
Press keeps mentioning that he's 80
years old
and he feels that's you know unfair
because everybody knows his age so you
don't need to mention it all the time
yeah
to me I don't think we should mention
anything else
yeah that I'm totally the opposite I
think the only thing they should say
about Biden is his age and then don't
say anything else
and we still have an 80 year old
president
in other news
that should be the entire political news
and he's still 80.
in other news
because as soon as you say he's 80
almost everything about him makes sense
right it sort of explains everything
I saw uh
Rob Reiner say that uh so far the first
couple years of Biden he's been the most
successful president in 60 years
most successful president in 60 years
I guess it depends what you're measuring
isn't it if you're if you're measuring
uh
if you're measuring immigration not so
much well depending on your point of
view I guess
so
here's another dog that's now barking
the one of the biggest stories
I know of the year
that I've seen mentioned like as a
statistic and then nobody talks about it
and it says the immigration coming
across the southern border
almost none of it
is Mexicans
why
why
don't you think that's like a really
important thing to know
why
is it
now here's why that's so important
is it reproducible
it did something happen in Mexico that's
unique to Mexico
economically or politically or
system-wise
what happened
how can how can Mexican immigration go
to basically nothing
now we understand that the other
countries are having you know maybe more
economic uh uh problems but did Mexico
suddenly become a first world country or
something
all the Mexicans who wanted to come are
already here that doesn't make sense
but no is it there there's something
going on right
is it that the cartels are filtering the
Mexicans out and they don't let them
come across
but why would they do that everybody who
wants to pay
it seems like they take their money they
don't care who it is
but but why would the cartels block only
Mexican citizens they're all willing to
pay money
it doesn't make it makes no sense
now they're already here doesn't make
sense the only thing that makes sense
is that the economy of Mexico maybe
isn't as bad as you thought
or there's something about the life
there that's better than we think
what do you think
I'm completely puzzled by that I have I
have no idea the the only thing I think
of is that the the Mexican economy is
not that bad
and that that gives you a standard
for how good the the Central American
countries would have to improve before
their you'd have a natural end to uh
immigration
but you realize that the Democrats are
very close to proving that their
immigration
process was better than the Republicans
do you see that
the Republic the Democrats are very
close
to proving they had a better immigration
standard by just opening it up
because if Mexico if Mexico just took
care of itself
like that the flow of people across the
border may be created maybe a better
economic situation in Mexico because a
lot of the American Mexican workers are
sending money back to Mexico it could be
that it was a self-correcting problem
is that possible
I'm I'm not going to state that as as my
current assumption but is it possible
that what happened with Mexican
immigration going to zero is because
having a lot of it for years
took off the pressure
like the the most dire people already
came
and then the people who got set up here
send money back to Mexico and then the
people who stayed in Mexico are doing
better
and they're just sitting there saying
well it isn't so bad here now could it
be that that the Kamala Harris method of
I mean she's done nothing that I know of
but if she if she worked on Central
America
to get them up to the level of the
Mexican experience
would immigration stop
the way it did in Mexico
I mean it's a bit isn't isn't that like
a gigantic question that nobody's asking
like why I haven't seen anybody ask that
on the news have you have you seen
anybody speculate
why the actual Mexican citizens stopped
coming to America
I've
your suggestion is what has been
suggested for decades so so the argument
would be that mass immigration
you might have Peaks and valleys but
that it would sort of take care of
itself over time has that always been
the the
sort of globalist opinion
because I'm I'm not unfriendly to that
opinion I just don't know
if there's any you know framework or is
there any is there any meat to that
oh it
if there's one thing you could say about
everything let me take a
a general statement about the world
it's really unpredictable
have you noticed that the things that
you're positive You can predict
yeah the most the most predictable thing
you could predict is if you open the
border between Mexico and the United
States there would be an endless and
maybe ever ever increasing flow of
Mexicans coming into the United States
isn't that the most predictable thing
that could ever be predicted
and it's not happening
the flow is coming from Central America
so like we can't even predict that are
you telling me that that can't be
predicted
oh
that is bizarre
all right
um
the government portals New Zealand
government has a portal on Facebook
my goodness
my goodness
Scott has willful blindness
maybe you have willful uh can't write a
message like an adult
how about you tell me what you think I
 missed how about that
you know I I have such curiosity about
the people like sitting there behind the
the comments
a lot of people comment
somehow not realizing that a human is
going to read it
because I feel like I've done that
I feel like I've said things about like
real people on Twitter and then when
they respond I say oh I didn't
think you'd actually read it
because I might have said it differently
if I thought the actual person I'm
talking about would actually see it now
of course the the effect is you know 100
times worse for me
because uh one of the problems about
being famous that they don't tell you
about is that you forget
have you ever heard that I've never
heard anybody talk about it but when you
are famous and I guess I'd be
semi-famous when you are semi-famous you
don't walk around all day thinking about
your Fame
you walk around all day thinking
you know it's time to do laundry and I'm
hungry and gotta walk the dog right I
mean my my head is all just in like
what's happening around me
and every once in a while I'll tweet
something and I'll mention somebody or
some organization and then suddenly it's
a big deal because they noticed it too
and I'm actually surprised like oh
I I forgot that people notice what I say
because I'm famous like you actually
forget you just go through your life
saying ah Who's Gonna Know
yeah so that's that's a a flaw that I
find in myself but I can't be alone
uh
you don't think I'm famous in the real
sense yeah you could argue that
so there was a Alex Jones Fuentes debate
um how many Saw The Alex Jones
Fuentes I don't know if his interview or
debate
I'm I'm told that I was uh prominently
featured in that debate did anybody see
that
I haven't seen it
uh so did anybody see me get referenced
oh there was a clip what clip was it
yeah
they played a clip of me now when they
played a clip of me were they were they
both uh agreeing with what I said or was
that a point of disagreement
was was one of them disagreeing with the
clip
it's the video when I talked about yay
okay
there's always agreement okay they
agreed
oh was it the Don Rickles reference
was that what it was
referencing yay basically taking on
everybody
that was something else all right well
I'll go find it
uh the clip about tossing the board
tossing the board what's that mean
I'm not sure you understand Mexican
immigration but I'm not sure you don't
well the the only question was is it
true that Mexican immigration has gone
to near zero
that's what the news is so I mean it
might be wrong
it's possible
all right
um
yeah I would say that I'm pocket famous
pocket famous meaning if you're in a
certain group of people I'm famous
but if you're in some other group you
never heard of me
so the other day
um
I I found out that my traffic on true
not much traffic the number of followers
I have on Truth social
had had reached about a half a million
and I basically you know I've tweeted
maybe five times total on truth and uh
Devin Nunes was giving me a hard time
over on Truth asking if I really if I
really use the platform and he ran a
little poll and it was all pretty smart
to get me to engage which I did
um so that was sort of well played well
played Devin Nunes well played
um and I will actually start uh posting
some more stuff on truth but to your
point of whether I'm famous
it took so I've got 800 000 followers on
Twitter which took seven years
seven years
and on truth I went from about I don't
know
low tens of thousands you know the first
months or so
uh to half a million I think just over
the summer
so how famous I am up here I appear to
be more famous among
Trump supporters
that wouldn't surprise you would it that
I'm more famous among Trump supporters
so apparently on truth truth I might get
to a million I don't know how many
people use truth but I might get to a
million followers on Truth before
Twitter
and yet the number of uh users of
Twitter is probably I don't know 20
times 100 times whatever it is
could be the Bots could be the Bots
yep could be the Bots
um
it's from a Babylon 5 appearance
uh
uh in the the quality of your audience
you spell quality wrong
uh during U.S recession always drinks
yeah
Mexican Academy is still expanding
okay
you know I think uh
here's what I think I'll bet you uh
private indoor gardens are going to be
gigantic in the next five years
that almost everybody's going to be
growing food in their home
and they'll be doing it as a backup
it'll be sort of it'll start as a
prepper kind of a thing well it starts
as a hobby thing you know just people
just think it's cool and then it's going
to move into the prepper
category I don't think it's a prepper
thing yet because it's not as cost
effective as it could be but I don't
think I don't think people will think uh
I need to grow all of my food forever I
think they're going to say if the supply
chain breaks down
uh I can eat this food on my wall for
two weeks so I got you know two weeks no
matter what
yeah it might be all just vegetables but
it would keep you alive
I think the problem with uh indoor Farms
is you can't get anything with protein
yet
I don't think you can grow a soybean if
if that's your thing
uh so that's a problem I think they need
some kind of GMO
you know some modified food you can grow
indoors that's high protein
you know some quinoa like a quinoa
related thing but something you grow on
a wall because you can't grow grasses on
a wall too easily you need too much of
it
yeah and you know the other thing is
there's a artificial Meats
how long before people are growing their
own artificial meat
because that should be a thing right
Peas I don't know peas
you can get a little bit of protein from
peas
chickpea Sprouts yeah okay
uh yams yeah yep I don't know if you'd
grow those indoors necessarily but I
think there's going to be a whole bunch
of things happening there
um
oh Mexico is stable enough that the
Asylum claim is not viable and that's
why they're not coming
well would that be
um
really
because I don't think that they need a
viable claim do they
all right let's check your so the thing
is that Mexico is stable
even though they're in the middle of a
gigantic Narco War
but let's call them stable
and therefore the uh people who would
claim they need to amnesty their claims
would be ignored but my understanding is
that everybody's claims are ignored and
that the reason they make the claim is
that they can be released into the
interior of the country until it's
adjudicated and then they just go on
with their lives and never go to the
court
so would that the same thing would apply
to Mexico as it would to the Central
American countries would not
yeah okay still a mystery
still a mystery yeah the light
um I think there's artificial light for
growing now that's pretty efficient
get to know a b farmer now that's the
best advice I've ever heard
I'm going to pass on your advice
get to know a beat farmer
young man young lady if there's one
piece of advice I could give you in this
world
one thing that will
set you on your path to success
get to know a beat farmer
yeah you can take that one to the bank
all right
uh is there any topic which I have
neglected
to mention
yay is a beach farmer b-e-a-t all right
all right
um I think that's all that's going on
right
that's all that's going on
so I I saw some uh on CNN they've got
some more uh allegedly intercepted phone
calls from Russian soldiers complaining
back home
and
I've got a feeling that the Russian
soldiers there's not going to be much
left after the winter
I don't know how the the Russian forces
survived the winter really I mean it's
going to be tough everywhere for the
ukrainians as well but I feel like it's
going to be harder for the Russians
although we'll never know because the
ukrainians are good at managing the
information flow
now you've all noticed by now right that
every time you see a video of the
Ukrainian forces
they look well fed and happy and they're
really big they're like physically large
and and they're on a they're usually on
some stolen Russian vehicle and they're
going to launch the missiles and they're
like
yeah it's like they're just having a
good time
and then anything you hear about the
Russians are it's about how they're you
know they're cannibalizing each other
because it's there's no food or
something I'm making that one up but
you've noticed right you've noticed how
controlled the information is on in
Ukraine it is so
incredibly propagandized is just really
thick now it's like the Ukrainian forces
have no uh casualties and the Ukrainian
forces never are cold and the Ukrainian
forces never have a food problem and the
Ukrainian forces never run out of
ammunition like it's as if that doesn't
happen but it's like massively happening
to the Russians
really
really yeah I've got a feeling the
ukrainians are having some struggles too
but you don't see any of it so they do a
really good job managing that
all right um
lost a hundred thousand officers
Maybe
they probably have to replace them
pretty often
yeah
yeah Russians are good at surviving the
winter but are they good when they're
not in Russia
is it's a part about not being in Russia
that's going to make it tough it's not
like they had all their resources and
they can share and everything else
Will trump even debate
all right I think we've uh said
everything that needs to be said I'm
going to go do some other things
I have to submit my book today to my
publisher
uh I gotta say it's looking pretty
strong
I think it'll be the most important
thing I've done
I think it will survive me by a long
time
it's going to be really controversial
too
it's going to make some people nuts
because some of the reframes I make some
claims that are so outrageous they're
true as far as I know they're true
everything in there is you know my my
best
my best attempt at the truest thing but
it's going to make people say I don't
know if that would work and then they're
going to try it
for example this I talked about this
these cure
where you just imagine sneezing in your
head and it makes the real sneeze go
away
now it doesn't work for all sneezes it's
good for the ones that are kind of
sneaking up on you not the sun ones but
a lot of people are going to read that
they're going to say well that's not a
thing that couldn't possibly be true
and then later someday they'll try it
and they'll make their sneeze go away
and they'll be like what
and suddenly everything that I wrote In
the book will seem more credible because

why does looking at the sun make you
sneeze did you know that 23 and me
can detect your genetic propensity for
sneezing because of the Sun

sneezing is a well understood phenomenon
and there's a a genetic cause so I have
that every every time I every time I
leave my gym
and walk to my car I sneezed my head off
all the way in the car and there there's
no allergy whatsoever it's just the sun
it's every time every time

they're always three
it's weird
all right that's all I got for now
