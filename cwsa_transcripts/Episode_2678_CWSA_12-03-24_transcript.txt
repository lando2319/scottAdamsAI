take a quick
look I hope your morning is
wonderful we can have some fun
today all right let's oop nope heading
in the wrong direction but not too
bad however we'll put up the comments
from the local subscribers here because
they're the
best all
right going to make some trouble today
you
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization careful I'm on my own
cord
there there we go there we
go all wrapped up in my own electric
cords
but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a kepper
muger a glass a tager chalis and a
canteen juger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine day
the day the thing makes everything
better it's SC simultaneous up and it
happens now go
extraordinary the best I've had all
morning I wonder if there is a
scientific study that suggests that
coffee is good for you oh here's one uh
there's a study that says uh it might be
a 177% reduction in all cause
mortality uh two to three cups per day
so you live on average 1.8 years of life
uh substantially benefits across diverse
populations uh adds life reduces your
Frailty oh my God I got to have another
set i'm reducing my Frailty a little bit
my Frailty seems a little high let me
see what I can do about
that yeah I think that's working my
Frailty has decreased 63% with one
sip that's called science people it's
called science don't get confused with
anecdotes well today's big day as you
know there will be a uh alien space War
uh the United States and the rest of the
world will be in a global combat with
UFOs uh that's what I'm told
right now that wouldn't be fake news
would
it would
it well I hope hope that there's an
alien UFO war that's all I want if you'd
like to see more of
me what you know you do would you want
to see more of me come
on uh but if you did want to see more of
me I will be on Newsmax today at 4:15
eastern time so for you Californians
that's 1:15 eastern time today and I'll
be talking about stuff things and stuff
and the news and things and
whatnot well according to scitech daily
there's a new kind of tattoo that can
read your
mind so it's not exactly what it sounds
like but they've got some kind of ink
that they can put a I think it's a
temporary tattoo and the temporary
tattoo will act like a brain sensor so
instead of putting a little sensor
device on your head they'll just put a
little temporary tattoo
and then somehow they can read it and
pick up your brain scans I guess I don't
think it's quite ready to go but it has
some promise so if you see a tattoo on
somebody's head they might be a
cyborg all right um according to S poost
all right let's see if you can get this
one right before I tell
you they tested virtual reality uh
feedback to see if it can reduce
depression and anxiety do you think that
putting somebody in a
different what feels like a different
physical environment because it's
virtual reality do you think that that
can
reduce their anxiety and
depression the answer is
yes yes again I guess as well as a
therapist so therapists aren't needed
anymore so that's a good job you should
uh no longer try to be uh
but it seems like it would depend
exactly what kind of virtual reality
you're you're
experiencing I still think it's going to
be better to walk
outoors so here's what they need to do
they need to test the virtual reality
compared to sitting indoors and being
sad that's probably what they did and
then compared to taking a long walk in
the park in the
morning I feel like I'd still bet on the
long walk in the park in the morning
over the virtual reality so next time
just ask me you don't need to do that
study Scott what will reduce my anxiety
and my depression more using some kind
of digital device in a clever way or a
walk in the
park I'm going to go with a walk in the
park well California is trying to uh rev
up its electric car
business um so it's going to give uh
rebates maybe up to $7,500
for uh it's going to replace the the the
federal rebates it went away uh but it's
going to
exclude
Tesla so if you buy an electric car you
can get a rebate well unless it's a
Tesla unless it's Tesla does that sound
personal does that sound like it's a
political statement against Elon Musk
well their argument goes like
this um if your penetration in the
market is above a certain level and
Tesla has good
penetration uh then uh you don't need to
boost that market because that Market's
doing okay by itself but if you want
competition to Tesla and those guys are
not doing so well and selling so many
cars then maybe you need to put the
money where the competition is now does
that sound fair to you that the company
that's doing the best is not
eligible to get the
rebate I don't know I think you could
argue this either way um if you're
arguing that you want to have as much
competition as
possible then maybe but if you're trying
to have as many um electric cars as
possible because the whole point is not
about having more electric cars the
point is about saving the planet right
so in every
case having more more electric cars is
better so that would argue that you
should give a rebate for every kind of
electric car but what if everybody said
well if I'm getting a 7 7500 rebate now
I'm definitely going to get a
Tesla so I'm not sure there's the right
answer yeah I mean it does seem unfair
to Tesla but fairness is an idea that
was invented so kids and idiots would
have something to talk
about and there I did had something to
talk about speaking of
unfairness well while Tesla will maybe
not get that California rebate musk has
been denied again his $ 56 billion pay
compensation package but interestingly
it's the same judge so is same judge has
now turned it down twice and which is
weird because the stockholders have
approved
it so why is the judge getting involved
in
stockholder
decisions doesn't feel right to me I
hope there's some kind of court that
that can be appealed to I don't know if
there is but
um here's the ironic part it's the same
judge that forced musk to go ahead and
buy Twitter when he was changing his
mind and he was like oh maybe this isn't
such a good idea and she's the one who
forced him to buy it
so the same judge who's screwing amount
of $56 billion which I assume he'll
figure out how to get because I don't
know how you can not solve that problem
it just feels like it's solvable some
way um yeah I mean given that the people
want the people want there's somebody
who wants to receive the money and
there's somebody who wants to give it to
them how can you not solve that why does
a court get in between I'd like to give
you money I would like to receive it and
the court is like whoa no hold on here
we've got to stop you from giving money
that you want to give to the person who
wants to receive it we better we we
better shut that down right
now but uh by forcing um musk to buy
what was
Twitter uh she ended up saving the
country the unintended consequence of
forcing him to buy the thing that he
changed his mind and wished he didn't
have to buy at that
moment saved America and I think that's
I feel that that's legitimately true it
actually saved the country because I
don't think if Trump had not gotten
elected I really think we'd be in
trouble like actually I don't know how
we how we could get out of it now we're
still in a lot of trouble because the
Deb is out of control Etc but at least
we have something like a legitimate plan
to take a real hard look at it with our
smartest people and and take you know
aggressive action against it so we
didn't have that before so this judge
may
have screwed musk and saved the planet
at the same
time well denesh
duza has announced and I guess
apologized for his documentary 2000
mules which claimed that there were
2,000 human beings acting as mules
meaning transporting stuff they were
ballots two ballot boxes and uh the the
claim was that they were um not all
legitimate votes and that they were
cheating but um people like me asked for
a little bit more evidence because I
wasn't sure that all the dots had been
connected and I asked uh can we give
some kind of evidence that these people
are really doing something wrong
or is it just people who picked up their
relatives ballots and mailed them you
know what's going on and uh so then then
I guess the validation was the cell
phone data to show that certain cell
phones were near certain boxes at
certain times but apparently the data
was so denesh I think only
recently found out that the data he was
trusting came from a source that he
should not have trusted and so the
strongest part of the evidence for the
2,000 mules has been
debunked by the maker of the documentary
I'm not sure what to think about this on
one hand I think hey that was a big
mistake on the other hand the fact that
he's saying it in
public I have a lot of respect for
that so that the fact that he's he's
taking it on the chin and just I I think
he's just putting it right out there
I did this wrong this was a mistake I
apologize I don't
know it it is
certainly it certainly makes me feel
better than if it hadn't
happened but I would like to make this
one comment for those of you who are
watching who can predict things well do
you know how many of you ask me to
comment on 2,000 mules and how many of
you said why are you not admitting that
2,000 mules proves everything we've been
suspecting and I kept saying it might
but I'm not I'm not feeling
comfortable that the data has quite made
that case so I'm going to do a Victory
lap for having been consistently
skeptical and not asking you to believe
that now I didn't debunk it I didn't
debunk it because I don't have
information to debunk it I was rather
not confident that you you should
believe it and that turned out to be the
right Instinct so if you keeping track
who's who's good on the BS spotting I'm
going to add that one to my
list
um so it turns out that opena is
Weighing on uh making money from
advertising in chat
GPT now as talker Carlson recently said
on a video if you're in the news
business and you take advertising you're
not in the news business I'm
paraphrasing this is my own framing of
it but if you're in the news business
and your business makes money from
advertisement you're not in the news
business for
long because the people doing the
advertising big Pharma for example
allegedly is more interested in making
sure you don't say bad things about them
so they become a ma major Advertiser and
then if something comes up in their
domain well there's a lot of things you
could talk about and maybe that one you
ignore so allegedly according to Tucker
who's in you know been in the news
business for longer than some people
have been
alive uh says absolutely positively
that's what's going
on um that the news business is Tainted
by the advertisement so what happens if
AI also becomes tainted by advertising
and how bad could it
be I'm now going to do a little
demonstration for you to show you how
bad it could be if advertisements affect
um search engines you right for this
this will be a live demonstration now
it's based on the fact that uh earlier
today I got a message that a uh
journalist was trying to find somebody
anybody who also had spasmodic dys
The Voice condition that RFK Jr has and
I used to have and it it was looking for
anybody who' had it who' been cured of
it and couldn't find anybody and I I
thought to myself how could you not find
me I'm a public figure I've been
featured in People magazine for getting
over this I've been in I don't know how
many Publications have talked about me
being cured of it I've posted on I've
talked about it on social media I've
done interviews on it obviously if you
Google me it's going to come up and say
it's it's curable and here's this guy
who cured it right want to test it so if
I Google me a public figure who
obviously is speaking correctly you can
tell I don't have spasmodic dysphonia do
you think it will say yes there are
number of cures a notable one would be
this cartoonist guy who's
disgraced but cured what do you think
it'll
say let's
try so we'll go to Google and the search
term which I already put in was who has
been cured of spasmodic
dysphonia who has been cured spasm Donia
so the first sentence should be well a
number of people and one of them would
be cartoonist Scott Adams and some other
names for example right here's here's
the first
sentence there's there's no cure for
spasmodic
dysphonia what's your head doing right
now you're listening to me in real time
I'm not the only person who was cured of
this I met lots of people who were cured
of it I talked to them
personally what's the second sentence
but treatments can help reduce the
symptoms
treatments treatments what kind of
treatments do you think do you think the
treatment would be somebody who spends a
lot of money to
advertise could be a big
farmer somebody who advertises on
Google let's
check but treatments can help reduce
symptoms the first one listed is uh
Botox Botox it's the first thing
listed uh injections of this bacterial
Botox into the vocal cords can help for
3 to four months the effect may need to
be repeated oh guess what guess what
it's a treatment that you have to do
forever and and at the time I was doing
it I think it cost $9,000 per
treatment every three months now I
wouldn't have paid that the insurance
would have but $9,000 for some
injections do you know what the
injections are like the injection goes
through the front of your throat to get
to the vocal cords on the back of your
throat yeah
but that would be so painful that they
give you a shot to numb the front of
your throat because otherwise you would
go insane if they put a needle big
enough to reach the back of your throat
through the front of your throat because
the real one is a big needle so they
give you a little needle to numb you and
then do you know how they find the right
place to put
it they have you go ah and then when it
sounds about right on their little
device they shove it in so they don't
see where they're putting it they do it
by
feel not even feel by by sound and
device so sometimes they get to the
right place and sometimes they don't if
they don't then your next three or four
months you don't speak well because they
don't get the right place so my vocal
cords were a little non-standard so when
I tried it uh it didn't always
work so I decided to stop doing it
because I knew that if I were continuing
to do the botox if I were to find
something else that worked I wouldn't
know because it would mask the effect so
I took the I took the baller approach to
discontinue everything that allowed me
to communicate with other human beings
for as long as it took to find something
that worked and I said my guess what
Google
Alerts my Google alerts for this
condition and then every time there was
some alleged you know treatment or some
idea I would get an alert and I check it
one of them was a surgeon Dr Gerald
Burke down at USC and he was sort of
like the big expert in this field and
allegedly he had a surgery to cure it
which I took and got cured as did a
number of other people at the time he
claimed it was about 85% effective and
15% he you know he did get the result
you wanted now 85% means 85% had a big
Improvement not always as much as I got
but a big Improvement the other things
that list are speech therapy and
psychological counseling and some
medications that I've never heard
of and some technology that makes you
speak louder it says other treatments
include surgery oh here it is here it is
so after 1 2 3 four five six things it
mentions surgery and it mentions the one
I
got and it
says uh other it's just
other and it doesn't say if it
works uh unfortunately it's a condition
that providers can't
cure I am cured I am talking to you with
a voice which has no trace of spasmodic
dysphonia
it is curable many many people have been
cured I know them
personally but the search engine tells
you that big farmer has the answer and
and that's not a cure you'll have to
take it forever do you see where I'm
going with
this you you see what world you live in
right if Google is your source of Truth
and they take advertisement from Big
Pharma is it Co incidence that their
answer is that big pharmer is the only
way to go and there is no cure now let's
try grock you ready for this let's try
grock I asked grock who has been cured
of spasmic
dysphonia Gro says while there is no
definitive cure for it in the
traditional sense uh some individuals
have experienced significant Improvement
or resolution of symptoms through
various treatments and then it calls me
out by name and it says Scott M the
creator of Dilbert has publicly stated
that he was cured of spasmodic dysphonia
through surgery performed by Dr Gerald s
Burke
MD the medical community generally does
not use the term cured for the condition
because treatments are managing
symptoms does it sound like I'm managing
my
symptoms or am I just
talking I'm not managing my symptoms I
don't have any
symptoms now do you see the difference
grock is built as a device that's trying
to give you truth do you think that
Google was trying to give me truth it
doesn't look like it it looks like it
gave me the pharma's best answer right
now I just did this right in front of
you you can reproduce this where you are
um and I think that uh perplexity didn't
get it right or
did yeah yes I am cured this is a
cure now I've been erased from the
internet when when I first got cured I
agreed to do a publicity tour and the
purpose of it was to make sure that
Google couldn't miss me if anybody
Googled spasmodic dysphonia the idea was
that since I'm you know a celebrity if
and I'm
cured that anybody who was looking for
spasmodic dysphonia and cure I would pop
up guess who pops up RFK Jr who isn't
cured and then an advertisement for
Botox that's your
world so you tell me if they do
advertisements in chat
gbt uh there's no point in never using
it
again there's no point in using an AI
that takes advertisement because any
question you ask in that domain won't be
trustworthy they'll have to manage the
answer to keep the advertisers happy
just like
this how many of you are having your
head explode right now because usually
you don't you don't get to see how clear
this this Pharma Distortion is this is
the cleanest clearest example you ever
see and by the way
I knew that the experiment would turn
out this way before I did it right that
that's how obvious and clear and bad it
is yeah
asymptomatic exactly well Daniel peny is
uh I guess the jury is going to be
deciding today unless they have maybe
they're already done um Daniel Penny
doesn't have a verdict yet right they're
just resting their case today
um and apparently he was greeted with
shouts of guilty and there was uh
protesters outside as he went
in
man I'm going to say it
again there's going to be a whole lot of
my opinion of the country of America
that depends on this
verdict
so you know it's not like the the jurors
aren't listening to me but maybe there's
some you know court of appeals
later I need this to go the right
way this really really needs to go the
right way I'm not going to be
comfortable living in this country
otherwise and you know what I think men
should just take a I I think men should
actually go on strike and say if you're
in trouble Good Luck Good Luck
ladies I I want every woman on that jury
because I assume they're a woman on the
jury I want them to know that they just
killed a thousand
women because that that's the man that
didn't get in didn't step
in if you get this wrong my head is just
going to
explode and I'm definitely not going to
be helping anybody who's in
trouble I don't want to go to jail crazy
crazy all right now that's probably not
true I probably would but I wouldn't
like
it um according to the world statistics
1.4 million American women do only fans
but only like .01% of them make money at
it 1.4
million so 1.4 million of the probably
the most seible women in the United
States just became kind
of so there go there's the top 1.4 and
then you take you take the uh social
media influencers out
it feels to me that women above a
certain level of
attractiveness have taken themselves off
the dating field as in if you're
involved in these
worlds uh I can't really have you
involved in sort of the family
traditional world
so I don't know what happens when you
take the top 10% of all the Attractive
people and say these ones you can't have
sex with or you won't want to based on
when you find out what they're up
to yeah online dating and this kind of
kind of made whole dating thing look
like a waste of time but luckily uh as I
already told you in the dilber reborn
comic there is a solution coming so
dogbert has started a little startup in
the dilber comic uh in which he's
creating a add-on genitalia for for
robots CU you know robots come without
any
genitalia and uh men and women are not
doing so well with each other
lately so you're going to need some kind
of an
outlet hey don't write it off yet it'll
be quite reasonably
priced anyway uh Peter duy reports
they're getting new information about
the dinner that Trudeau had with Trump
at marago
and according to people who were there
the following conversation happened that
Trudeau told Trump that uh Trump's new
tariffs would kill the Canadian economy
if he goes ahead and puts them on there
and Trump allegedly joked to him that if
Canada can't survive without ripping off
the US uh hundred billion dollars a year
then maybe Canada should become the 51st
state and trudo should become its
governor
come on how much do you love that
President come on you love that you love
it was it polite of trump to say
that probably not was it diplomatic for
Trump to say that uh not too
diplomatic was it was it useful for
Trump to say that probably not was it
funny for Trump to say that
yes therefore approved
approved now it was more than funny it
was more like reminding reminding him
who was the big dog which I just love I
just love the fact that he did
that now it does have use it does have
use he's telling him I'm much bigger
than you and if I want to threaten you
economically you're going to have to go
along with it because you don't have any
any hand to
play well done negotiator and chief
Trump
um Trump is also Trump is really testing
out the Trump effect now the Trump
effect as I like to call it is when
people are sort of putting their own
house in
order before Trump gets there because
they know he's going to force them to
you know go back to Common
Sense uh and they want to get there
before he forces them so Trump just put
in a big threat to Hamas to release the
P prisoners before he gets uh
um before he gets signed into office
January 20th what do you call it uh
what's the word not signed into office
he's
uh what you do on January
20th the word is when you're
officially signed into office your uh
what the hell is that
word inauguration thank you
inauguration so here's what's funny
about
that he said that if they don't give the
prisoners back by then they'll be all
held to pay in caps and uh he'll hit
them harder than anybody has been hit in
the long and stored History of the
United States of
America now do you like that idea do you
like that
threat here's the funny
part if you didn't catch the funny
part Biden has one last chance to do
something to recover a little bit of his
reputation which is now more tattered
than anybody who's ever left office
except Nixon and he was and he was
pushed out by a
coup so the only thing that Biden has
the only thing he has is if it's a long
shot it's a Hail Mary but if if he can
get those hostages back before he's out
of
office
well well if those hostages come back
now before uh Biden is out of office
Trump gets to say it was because of him
because he threatened
them so he just removed from Biden the
only hope that Biden had of doing a
positive thing before he left office he
left him
nothing do you know the movie
300 there's that famous scene where one
of whoever's the whoever's the hero of
the movie is a take from them
everything you leave them nothing he
didn't leave them a crumb
there was one crumb you could have left
him was well well why don't you see if
you get those those hostages back
because it's winding down anyway you
know it's winding down so you kind of
suspect sometime in the next several
weeks would be a good time for them to
come back under the you know just normal
conditions of how things
work but uh I just love the fact that he
just completely took that away from
Biden Biden has no chance of getting
anything leonitis thank you
leonitis meanwhile South Korea has
allegedly uh declared martial
law which made all of us say
uh
what martial law South Korea is there
some news that maybe I should have been
following for the last several weeks
that I'm not aware of what the hell is
happening in South
Korea so allegedly there's some anti
anti-government forces have been too
active and shutting down their progress
but it looks like it looks like he's
just going domestic fascist against the
uh opposing party so let's keep an eye
on this one but it doesn't look like
good
news uh maybe we'll never know what what
is really behind it it could be some
trying to trying to catch some North
Korean spy or something I'm not sure
we'll know exactly why this happened
could be one of those things where it's
a head fake and there's some other thing
going
on anyway according to
rasmason uh
49% um favor pardoning the January 6ers
but most
people um I think 2third or so want them
to be on an individual basis let's see
if I got that right yeah no yeah
67% want want the pardons to be on a
Case by case BAS
that was my opinion
until
today my current opinion is uh let them
all
go because there would not be a single
person at that
event uh had not the election been
stolen and and had not uh everything
looked sketchy now here's the thing if
you say to me Scott can you prove the
election was stolen my answer is is no I
don't need to here's what I can prove I
can prove that you ran an election in
2020 in which it look stolen and we
couldn't tell the difference if you do
that it's your problem if there's a riot
it's your problem if somebody gets hurt
responsibility is on whoever puts
together an election system that the
public can't trust if the if the public
could have trusted our system and then I
saw these hooligans Go and protest and
cause trouble I would have said you damn
Hooligans you know we can trust this
system what are you doing you're making
America worse you're hurting people for
no reason you go to jail you
that's what I would
say but we don't have an election system
that is credible and we knew it and the
people in charge knew it and they ran
that system again like they always
do and it was sketchy as hell the way it
came out I don't know if it was cheated
or not but it looked like it I can tell
you it looked like it so if you're going
to give me an election system that we
told you was sketchy and then you give
me a result that looks exactly like a
stolen election no it's your fault if
somebody gets hurt it's your
fault if somebody gets hurt so now I
want everyone of the January Sixers
released including the violent
ones including the violent
on because if that election had actually
been stolen I wouldn't have been so
against
violence let let me say that again if
there were proof that the election had
been stolen and we don't have that there
is not proof of the election being
stolen but if there had been I would
have been in favor of some
violence now now don't do any violence
so if you see some problems in the next
election don't do any violence
so let me say I don't want to encourage
violence however looking at the past
instead of the future if it had happened
and we
knew that the election had been rigged
uh I wouldn't be I wouldn't be in favor
of violence against the police officers
that were just doing their jobs but yeah
if you try to overthrow my
country violence will happen that's what
violence is for
let me be as clear as that as possible
violence has a purpose it's it's to keep
the country together we use violence
against criminals we use violence
against people who to attack us if
somebody had used violence somebody had
used violence against somebody who had
hypothetically tried to run a coup on
this country I would not care about that
one bit if the violence was aimed at the
right people not not the law enforcement
law enforcement was just doing law
enforcement stuff so I don't approve of
that but I do say that that the cause of
it is not the people who attend it the
cause is the people who ran an election
that looked to all of us at least all of
us were watching
this it looked rigged I don't have proof
of
it but it sure looked
rigged so yes I say uh I say pardon
every one of them and don't even look at
them individually I do it on the first
day and I would not look at any one of
them
individually boy will people complain
and I don't
care well the view continues to uh
embarrass itself so I guess management
is coming down pretty hard on The View
because they made co-host Sunny hoston
read yet another uh legal note is this
the fifth or sixth time they've had to
do it um regarding comments she made of
a p
Heth and then
whoopy uh also related to The View being
crazy Whoopi said that
U that we shouldn't call it a lie that
Hunter Biden said he wouldn't pardon
Hunter and then he did he's like well I
don't think we should call the
LIE uh that's
almost the exact definition of a lie a
thing you know you're going to do and
you say the opposite multiple times as
clearly as possible possible what would
be the other word for
that I'm not aware of
it
anyway
um so whoy wants people to stop accusing
Biden of lying for saying he wouldn't
pardon his son I think maybe your
argument is that he meant it when he
said it but you know in the weight of
larger issues maybe he changed his mind
no he didn't let's we don't have to read
Minds to know that nobody's going to let
their son go to prison if they can
simply sign a piece of
paper I would have hated Biden if he let
his own son go to
jail and he didn't need
to I mean I don't love him as a
politician already he has to me he has
the the lowest level of uh
respect but if he had not protected his
own family when it would be easy to do
so
I mean that would be even less respect
so it was legal it was possible of
course he was going to do it of
course Stephen A Smith is uh interest
has some interesting points about this
he says people feels like people feel
like fools supporting Democratic party
and the uh and he thinks they should
feel scammed so the whole uh Joe Biden
is fine there's nothing wrong with his
brain oh yes there is and then you get
to I'm never going to pardon my son oh
yes I did and if you want to go
further uh think about the fact that
Trump was
impeached for trying to look into the
very thing that that Hunter just got
pardoned for why did why did Hunter get
pardoned all the way back to 2014 which
would not include includes the gun
charges but it goes way further back um
why
why would they need to Pardon him unless
Trump was on the right path when he was
looking
into uh investigating so this goes all
the way back to the fake the fake
impeachment I mean the the Democrats
could not have disgraced their party and
their voters any harder than it did they
really made their voters look like
idiots they did because they they fooled
them with a with something that didn't
fool a single Republican
how would you like to be in that
situation there wasn't a single
Republican who was fooled by anything
they
tried but all of them were
fooled like right every Republican
thought that Joe Biden looked fine his
brain is fine and yet every Republican
said what are you looking at he's
clearly it's clearly something wrong
then they ran KL Harris and they
convinced themselves that she was like
the next coming and she'd be great and
every Republican said what are you
looking at she might be the worst
candidate of all time of all of all
candidates
ever so this is yet again you know this
reversal on the pardon from uh from
Biden and the media is talking about uh
how this is tainting his positive
reputation tainting Biden's positive rep
reputation Biden is the most famous liar
in all of politics and has been for 60
years or whatever however long he's been
there 50 years he he's the most famous
serial liar like he's famous for lying
it's it's not even something he does
also he's famous for
lying and and and it seems pretty clear
to me that he was involved in some
sketchy stuff with the family business
so he might be the most
famous corrupt lying politician of all
time and the media did such a job of
shining as turd that when it all fell
apart and you couldn't you couldn't
protect it anymore the media acts like
it was a new change like huh things were
going so well until till that bad part
at the end no it was just the media
making think that the biggest liar and
crook we've ever seen in that office was
was was uh almost you know
Angelic good job
media uh according to the conversation
James Goodwin there's a uh study about
the co lockdowns says it was bad for
young people's brain structures so
adolescents their brains did not develop
in the way that they normally
would uh they used MRI to look at them I
guess they the the brains folded
differently normal Ys but here's my
question it does make sense that young
people would be more affected because
their brains are more likely to be in a
maturing state but don't you think that
everybody got totally changed by the
pandemic um I can speak for myself my
brain is completely different after the
pandemic meaning that even my
preferences for things changed I mean
I'm I'm not even the same person so I
think that the damage from the pandemic
is certainly in the young and maybe
mostly but boy did it
affect everybody that's my take would
would would most of you say the same
thing that the the pandemic gave you a
permanent change and not necessarily a
good one it's definitely permanent in my
case and axio says that this is funny
axus actually said that uh Biden uh
sacrificed the moral High Ground the
moral High Ground Biden actually ran on
being a racist he ran on being a racist
and saying he would be anti-white and he
would make sure that he didn't hire a
white person for a vice president and
then he pushed Dei and the fine people
hoax he was the biggest lying racist
piece of and a crook that the
country has ever known and axio refers
to that as abandoning The High
Ground abandoning The High
Ground
anyway and even John Stewart just
totally mocked the Democrats for for all
their statements about you know nobody's
Above the Law and he played the
compilation
clip yeah so even the Democrats are
embarrassed by this and of course as all
the smart people have noted that the
pardon of Hunter is really a larger play
to make sure there's not a criminal
investigation that could find out about
all of his Biden family crimes in
Ukraine and China and who knows where
else so the real play here was not just
to protect Hunter the real play was to
protect the whole Biden family and the
Democrat Party in general from what is I
would say somewhat obviously a criminal
Enterprise
I don't have proof of it but I would say
that what we've seen so far would make
it appear obvious to me that it was a
criminal
operation and this might be one way to
protect
it Chuck Todd seems to have turned on
Biden for his
selfishness uh he says that Biden Biden
deciding to run for president this
actually a pretty good point from Chuck
Todd um when he knew that his son had
these
problems and he knew that it would put
his son right in the middle of the
Arena so not only did Biden run for
president knowing it would affect his
family
negatively but it destroyed the Democrat
Party and almost the
country he is clearly the worst
president of all time he it was bad for
his family completely destroyed the
Democrat Party there's nothing left
really
and and America almost went down too he
he almost took down the strongest
country in the world from incompetence
and selfishness and crime and racism so
worst president of all time yes very
easily the worst president of all
time anyway
um and uh they're pretty sure that he
had all that loyalty and honesty
uhhuh so Joe Mansion has called for
Biden to Pardon
Trump um to sort of clean things up and
balance it after the
uh uh after the pardon of Hunter now I'm
almost on board with that except the the
pardon that Hunter got was
unprecedented it covered things that
weren't even mentioned things that were
further back in time than the crimes
that were on the table
uh that was unprecedented do you think
that Biden would give Trump an a
completely
unprecedented from the time you came
down the golden staircase till now any
everything you did is fine
no should he probably probably should is
there any chance of it no there's no
chance of it because the Democrats are
not a honorable honest
um High Ground kind of
organization we'll be lucky if they
don't try to kill
them um there's a report in the National
pulse that Canada is actually um
boosting their own border security
because of Trump's threats do you think
that's true I'm not entirely sure that's
true but maybe
um I see people
um criticizing operation warp speed and
Trump um because Trump says it a success
but I think that most of you would say
it
wasn't now did you know that there's now
a
um there's now a
report that's coming out about the covid
situation from the select subcommittee
on the cor Corona virus pandemic now the
select subcommittee
is not a bunch of Democrats as far as I
can tell is it all is it all
Republicans give me a fact check on this
is the the Congressional subcommittee on
the Corona virus pandemic is it all
Republicans because they're they they
have kind of a republican take on it so
I think it
is here's what they found they said that
uh the the virus probably came out as
the Wuhan
lab um it was funded by an American
group us tax Bakers through Ecco Health
Alliance um and that the rules and the
mandates like to stay six feet apart and
shut everything down was not based on
any kind of science as you
imagined and uh and mostly that was just
bad and wrecked the economy destroyed
small businesses and left kids with
massive learning loss and mental health
problems Etc and that the vaccine did
not prevent
transmission but here's what it also
said now this is not my claim this is
what it said and these are the
Republicans that looked into everything
to see what was a lie and what was true
so their claim
is uh that operation warp speed was a
tremendous success and a model to build
upon in the
future the vaccines uh which were are
better characterized as Therapeutics so
they're being honest that they did not
stop any transmission uh to speak of but
as Therapeutics they say undoubtedly
quote saved millions of lives by
diminishing the likelihood of severe de
disease and death all right
now does that sound like what you
believe is
true CU I think most of you don't
believe that's true and I don't know if
it's true all I know is it's something I
read from somebody I don't know so I
don't know one way or the other but the
official story is this the official
story is that the vaccinations were a
huge
success but but you're not there are you
probably none of you but your
Republicans are the people you vote for
say it's a huge success a huge success
saved
Millions you know at the expense of you
know mental health of children and
stuff if you care about
that anyway so I don't know what's
true um but I want you to know what what
your team says is true so if you're on
the Republican team your team leaders
are saying that the vaccinations were a
huge success and something we should do
again but without the closedowns and
without the mandatory
stuff are you are you pleased with that
if it's not
mandatory I don't know if it's not
mandatory it feels feels a lot
different
um speaking of uh I have to get back to
Hunter for second if you're not familiar
with Mike Ben and his his uh
characterization of what the US has been
trying to do in Ukraine since 2014 and
before you don't understand anything
about the Hunter Biden story your
minimum you know entry to even know
what's going on is to know Mike benz's
take now I'll do my best to to summarize
it but you have to hear his version for
the for the convincing version so
apparently America has always been
basically a robber baren country we we
try to bully and Conquer and overthrow
any country that we can get their
resources or get their get some kind of
kind of Leverage so basically we are and
have been the bad guys always that's the
first thing you need to know America is
not The High Ground America is the
lowest of the low ground we're in it for
the money of the richest Americans not
everybody's money and that the
government is basically a puppet of the
rich people and what they really want to
do is get Russia out of the energy
business so they can have all of that
for themselves now that would be good
for America if you could actually get
away with that and Russia which
is a big question mark I don't know if
we can but if you could you could
imagine it' be good for America and
really really good for the rich
people especially in the energy business
so did you know that the US government
the CIA ran a coup to overthrow Ukraine
and uh and we've been moving uh we we we
lied to the Soviet Union a long time ago
when we said we would not move Nato one
step closer to Russia as long as they
allowed Germany to reunite so they said
yes on reuniting we said yes we won't
move NATO and then we lied about it four
years later and we just started moving
nato in bases and missiles and basically
creating a military front right on their
front
door then we use that that leverage and
that power to hope that we could simp
simply
run a coup and take over one of Russia's
biggest assets Ukraine which has you
know gigantic you know mineral deposits
in at least two places now key to that
according to Ben was barisma was going
to become sort of
America's U fake private entity so it
would act like it's a big private
company but it would be doing what
America wanted it to do if everything
worked out so it would be the answer to
Russia's big state company gas prom so
they'd have some counterbalance there
and they would try to put gas problem
out of business and take all their gas
and Pipeline and and oil
business but Russia of course not
wanting us to steal all their business
uh did some uh military intervention and
in a few different phases they got
Crimea and the dbass and so if you look
at the areas that Russia controls now
they've got about half of all the
mineral and Mining resource rights that
had belonged to
barisma so the war in Ukraine is largely
about getting barisma back in business
reclaiming as much of their mineral
rights and territories as possible so
that we can use Warfare lawfare and
economics to crush Russia for our
profits
and that Hunter was probably a key
member of the CIA larger plan for
controlling barisma and overthrowing
Ukraine and destroying
Russia now that's not the story you hear
on the news is
it so if you're not listening to people
like you Glenn Glenn Greenberg and Glenn
Greenwald and
uh Michael shellenberger
and uh Mike
Ben you know the the people who actually
have studied it and know know all the
players you don't know what's going on
right the whole the whole Ukraine thing
was dirty from top to bottom and it
wasn't necessarily for your benefit or
mine it was for the benefit of rich
people basically and then the rich
people got the the the military people
to say it's a good idea because they
could make money too so the bidens were
making money in Ukraine Democrats were
making money the the arms people were
making money and the energy people were
trying to make
money and that was your war and that so
far 600,000 ukrainians have
died for us to try to make some more
extra money over there we are the bad
guys
entirely just entirely now here's the
complicated part
only the bad guys
survive so I'd also like to survive and
it's true that countries that are
growing meaning conquering and
colonizing are stronger than ones that
are shrinking or trying to stick to
themselves because they'll get conquered
or colonized so on one hand America has
been very very bad with this Ukraine
stuff and not the first time we've been
very very bad with what overthrowing 8
countes so far and you know don't even
get me started about Columbus so we've
been a very very bad bad country for 250
years
but that's why we
survived because we were colonizing like
crazy and growing and and building our
army and making sure nobody could
conquer us and you we had some we had
advantages like two oceans that really
kept us safe so that helped a lot
but um I'm still Pro America in case you
wondered but it is still nonetheless
fair to say that America has been a
bully and a thief uh for all of its all
of its time I think and we try to paint
it as we're the moral ones with the high
ground and nothing like that's true it
is true however that if America does
well it's probably good for most of the
world so that's the the only part that I
that I feel comfortable with that having
one strong America that's the dominant
superpower it's not fair and we'll
definitely do some super dickish things
if we have all the power but might be
better than all of the
Alternatives because almost everything
else would be worse so I'm still Pro
America but we have to be honest we have
to be honest about who we are and what
we do
because uh otherwise we're just going to
be confused and gas lit and we're not
going to know what's going on so yeah I
I think that Trump can solve Ukraine do
you know why he can solve
Ukraine here here's the fast answer why
Trump can solve
Ukraine he's going to treat it like what
it actually
is that's all you need you just have to
tell the truth about what anybody is
doing there and then you can negotiate
but if you say stuff like oh Russia is
trying to steal their democracy well you
got nothing oh Putin Putin's a
monster well you you got
nothing oh we can't let the so the the
Russia turn into the old Soviet Union
and you got nothing you got nothing
here's how you could turn that into
something you could
negotiate looks like you guys want to
make money on
energy we want to make money on energy
too we want to compete with you here's
what we think you could ever capture
militarily here's what we think we
probably would end up with if we keep
fighting let's just sort of split it in
the middle because we don't know exactly
how it would go but you keep what you
got we'll keep what we got and we won't
do any more NATO expansion but you're
going to have to get into of Syria
for example and you're going to have to
stop uh boosting
Iran for example and by the way if you
want a warm water Port we're open to
it so what Trump can do is simply treat
it like what it is it's an economic
situation with a a military
layer and now is part of several
military and economic situations that
are all connected through some kind of
Russian or us
connection so Trump can simply treat
them for what they are economics with a
military filter and just say what do you
need what do we need what's the best
either one of us can do let's stop
shooting each other and see if we can
make it work without the killing I think
he can do that it's all there I mean
it's all doable and all the right people
are involved at this point
vacine efficacy proof is a thesis as
proving that didn't make any sense
that's a bad
analogy um what is this big chart
somebody keeps seeing sending to
me uh public from scratch you less than
50 years
old
oh so it's a map showing that the
European Union basically hasn't created
any uh any big Tech startups or
basically anything successful in 50
years and the US has been crushing it
for 50
years true all
right
um so China is
uh Banning the exports of some rare
minerals that are important like gallium
and germanium and
antimony now if you've never heard of
antimony uh that's when ants get
divorced and one of them has a job and
the one the ant with a job will have to
pay antimony to the to the other
ant it's probably not what that means I
think it's actually a rare rare earth
material but they have lots of military
applications um and that's probably in
response to the to Biden Administration
putting rest restrictions on chips sent
to China so semiconductor
chips um just the news is reporting that
we won't be sending them our good stuff
so I thought we already didn't send them
are good stuff but there must be more
good stuff that we were sending that
were not then China is
responding I feel like it would be
easier for the US to find other sources
of gallium geranium and antimony than it
would be for China to get these high-end
chips so I feel like we still have the
negotiating Edge on
that um there's a new scariest drone
you've ever heard of in your life it
can't be jammed and it's a little X-Wing
so it's like a little uh the wings cross
each other like an X just like Star Wars
and they're small they're you know sort
of a hand launched kind of Siz thing um
and they can go 62
miles um wait you see the top
speed it can go 136 M hour in speed it
can travel for 62 miles and the onboard
AI gives it electronic warfare immunity
meaning so it'll it jams avoids the
jamming allowing an operator control of
the Drone without a continuous data
connection I don't I don't know how the
operator could operate it without a
continuous data
connection and anyway but they somehow
they do it and it's also jamming
resistant and uh I don't remember if it
had AI on it or a facial
recognition but anyway human remains in
control of the critical decisions but
you've already seen that there's all the
uh strange drones that are buzzing our
military bases and we don't know who's
doing it and last night there were some
big sightings of large siiz drones
people said and nobody knew where they
were coming from now we got
these aren't we going to have a wave of
terrorist murders using this exact drone
now I think these are made in Germany so
I don't know how hard they would get be
to get but are you telling me that I
couldn't buy one of these if I were in a
country where they could sell them I
couldn't buy one of
these and know where there's going to be
some big political
rally and know exactly where the Lecter
is and you see Trump standing behind the
glass the glass protects him from the
sides doesn't protect him from the
top but if you're a drone you can you
can literally go right above it and then
straight down how in the
world are you going to keep one of these
drones from taking out a political
leader at the Lector in front of a big
crowd of
people it's made for exactly that so I
think the days of uh our leaders
appearing in public are probably over we
we might have one year left because
Trump is a little braver than most we
might have one
year left where a president can appear
in public
because of
these how are you going to stop it I
don't know how you'd stop
it anyway did you know that Rachel madow
was once a protege of Keith obman and
Keith olberman was important in getting
her job and and really pushed for her
and helped her become one of the biggest
people in
TV I have mixed feelings about
[Laughter]
that I have mixed feelings number one uh
I don't think Rachel madow is good for
the
country but number two she's very
successful she's a female and uh a
lesbian and if Keith
was um a mentor for her career and
really went to bat for her and and made
it work I'm just going to compliment him
I I from what we know that looks like
just really good private work because I
don't remember him bragging about it
I've never heard of this before so if he
if he helped a person who was not on the
let's say not in the mainstream channel
of you know who the network might have
considered and he boosted her to the
point of getting her a you know $30
million a year career and now 25 million
a year he's not as happy with her at the
moment but I'm quite impressed with that
I'm very impressed that he took interest
in somebody who's outside his his own
little defined area and uh pushed until
until she
succeeded I like
that so I think I'll end on the positive
note yeah apparently he's not as happy
at the moment but but I like that he did
that anyway
um that's all we
got celebrate
Dei yeah you know I don't mind if it
happens on an individual
basis see Dei on an individual basis
doesn't feel like
Dei if you do it on an individual like
one person is mentoring somebody that
feels like it's because that person has
the skill and may may have been
overlooked otherwise so that's what it
feels like she obviously had the skill
she pulled it
off anyway
um see me today on Newsmax at uh 4:15
eastern time I'll try to entertain you
there and I'm going to talk to the uh
folks on locals privately right
now all right thanks for joining
