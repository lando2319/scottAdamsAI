looks like nvidia's up Tesla's
down Bitcoin down and the SNP about
flat Israel's up a little bit turns out
having a war is good for their
economy well we're going to have quite
the show
today going to put up some comments by
the locals
people because they
get the best of everything
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time in your whole life but if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand where
they're tiny shiny human brains all you
need is a gupper mug girl glass a tanker
chel sste a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine of the day thing that makes
everything special it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens right
now
go now there's something you can't mail
in am I right that's that's right got to
do it in
person no ID
required well I've got all kinds of
things to talk about shall I jump right
in there's a uh according to Wall Street
Journal there might be a big
breakthrough in electric
motors which would be a gigantic big
deal because the size of the
Breakthrough could be like an 80%
efficiency apparently uh Ben Franklin
invented a little electric motor back in
his day
that was not considered efficient enough
and for whatever reason the new Modern
Motors became the standard but there
have been other developments in science
that might make old Ben Franklin's
design that seems to instead of sending
a flow of energy does it back and forth
between negative and positive somehow
and can reduce maybe your can incre
improve your efficiency
tremendously might be 80% better
that now that might not sound like a big
story to you but there's going to be an
electric engine in every robot and every
car if you can make them 80% more
efficient that's everything like that
everything you assumed about the economy
the future completely different just
with this one one invention if it works
now it's not really right on the edge of
you know they're going to roll it out
they they need some work but it looks
like it
might and you know the the thing about
the future and predicting it is that
probably it's going to be you know six
people in a garage somewhere trying to
make an electric motor work better or
somebody invented something to make a
battery better or somebody figured out
how to make a a small modular nuclear
power plant a little bit safer better
faster and that's going to be everything
basically you could just look at energy
inventions and you would know everything
about the future of a country so let's
hope we out invent other countries I
like our odds uh there's a story that
says uh from no Ridge that says vitamin
B12 might be the key to reducing your
chronic
inflammation well I have lots of chronic
inflammation I have always and I've
tried to figure out what that is all
about and uh I have a pretty a pretty
good opinion on this now now you could
talk to your doctor that'd be one way to
find out about your health or you could
listen to a disgraced cartoonist on the
internet which one makes more
sense well it's probably closer to a tie
than you'd like to admit but uh I can
tell you from my own experience that
what makes you have chronic inflammation
is
everything I think everything every
little pollution every every food
additive every Everything You Do
Everything You Touch It Feels Like
Everything causes inflammation so I have
experimented with taking B12 and not
taking B12 and I can tell you that my
experience of chronic inflammation was
no different
however I suspect B12 is good for you
now I'm not a doctor so don't take my
advice
for any of this but uh I'd be surprised
if it's bad for you so but but it's not
going to cure your inflammation I pretty
sure of that unless you have the one
kind of inflammation that is only caused
by B12 which would be amazing to me and
then who knows but listen to your doctor
don't listen to
me so I saw a story that uh according to
something called intelligent I guess
that's a publication one and six
companies are hesitant to hire recent
college graduates because they have all
kinds of problems with these college
graduates what do you think of the
problems well five% of the companies
report that some of the college recent
college
graduates um were
unsatisfactory now does that sound like
a problem if 5% of your college hires
turned out to be not good I would say
that's actually pretty good rate but
it's but the the story is that it's bad
news is it if only 5% of the people you
hired who had college degrees turned out
to be bad I feel like you'd be one of
the best hirers of all time so that
doesn't sound bad 5% six and 10
companies fired a recent college
graduate they hired this year again six
and 10 companies firing a recent college
graduate well that's just the
5% so that's not really very scary
that sounds kind of in line with what
I'd expect um one in six hiring managers
say they're hesitant to
hire um people from this group in other
words recent college graduates well why
do you think that they're hesitant to do
that the the news is full of
stories about they're all incompetent
and they're they can't do anything well
if you've ever read the news of course
you'd be
hesitant but so far the two pieces of uh
you know data that they've given me have
not not suggested any reason for pain
but let us continue hiring managers say
recent college graduates are unprepared
for the
workforce that's what a recent college
graduate
is if any of you were ever recent
college graduates do you remember how
unprepared you were for the workforce oh
my God it's the definition of unprepared
oh yeah very unprepared but is that
different is that new this is exactly
the way it's always been one in seven
companies May refrain from hiring
college graduate well again because they
read the news nine and 10 hiring
managers say recent college graduates
should undergo eate
training I think that could be
useful but I don't think it's the end of
the world
either yes it's true that some people
need a little you know etiquette it'd be
a good idea I'm I'm all for it I don't
think it's going to be the difference
between inventing a new microchip and
not it's like oh we're trying to we're
trying to invent a new way to
communicate we're trying to build a
satellite but it turned out that Eric
didn't know which Fork to use at lunch
so it all fell
apart yeah I mean it would be good to
have all these manners and stuff but
probably doesn't change how many
satellites get
invented and uh three and four companies
report issues with recent graduate hires
of course because they've got issues
with every one of the cohorts that they
hired you you could randomly pick any
group of people you you can make it
racist you could make it sexist how
about we'll just look at the lgbtq new
hires do you think that managers have
had any problems in the lgbtq community
probably
now in my in my experience the LG
lgbtq employees are unusually
good just you know anecdotally I have no
science behind that they just just my
experience is that the people who are
out just tend to be pretty serious
people and know how to get stuff done so
but I think you could take any group and
then ask the manager if they've had any
recent problems with them and
statistically speaking they would say
yes even if it was their very best group
they'd say yeah I got a problem two
people were a problem this month every
group has problems so I think this might
be a continuation from uh ancient
Greece uh I have a distant memory that
there's some quote from ancient Greece
somebody like you know Plato or Socrates
or somebody like that saying that the
new generation are all are all basically
worthless
[Laughter]
and then then that generation grew up
and realized that they were actually
pretty awesome but the Next Generation H
H they're looking pretty awesome and
then repeat repeat repeat when I was a
kid I heard every single day that the
hippies that were in my generation were
all worthless dirty nonworking pieces of
trash and uh the world was going to end
and it just never stops
we just always think the next generation
is garbage here's
why here's
why 80% of every group is not
helping so of course you need all the
people to do all the jobs that need to
be done so they're they're getting jobs
done but the people who are making
civilization move forward it's like 1%
of 1% of the country and guess
what did I just sound
like Joe Biden guess what um people
guess what it's the same 1% and 1% that
are making the country move forward that
has always been the same 1% and 1%
everybody else is just carrying things
just moving stuff right but you need
that I mean the country would fall apart
so some some people are digging in the
ground to dig up some coal to move it
somewhere to do something with it so
most of the world is just moving stuff
you know they're driving stuff they're
they're moving papers back and forth and
then 1% and 1% are inventing the
future that 1% and 1% is probably
stronger and better than it's ever been
any time in history so we might be in a
better shape than any time in history
but it would always look like it isn't
and it will look like that next time and
next time and next time Daniel Penny you
remember him he was the one who tried to
uh keep people safe on a subway train by
restraining somebody who was looking
dangerous the person who was looking
dangerous died in his grips um it didn't
look like it was a killer grip but you
know maybe drugs were involved we don't
know but it's coming to trial I guess on
Monday and uh the reporting is that the
the lawyer will try to put the people in
the who are uh in the jury they're going
to put him in the car now that means
mentally so this is a uh a lawyer trick
from Jerry Spence I read his book how to
how to argue and win every time or
something like that A Very Old book but
very
influential and I think maybe that's
where I got a lot of my interest in
Persuasion was learning about how one
defense lawyer won every single case and
what he would do is he would simply put
the jury uh he would take them on a ride
and tell a story where he put the jury
in the spot of the person he was trying
to get some money for whatever accident
they were in and the people just feel it
they they just became the victim and
then if you become the victim it's
pretty easy to give money to the victim
because you're the victim
so that of course um I don't know if the
reporting is based on something they
know from the defense's plans or it's
just obvious but uh here's how I would
do it
I would say it's a whatever it is I'm
going to make up the facts these these
are not the real facts it's Tuesday
morning you had your coffee and you went
to work just like always you got on the
subway you're already feeling a little
bit of concerned because the subway is
getting a little more dangerous you do a
look around you ask yourself if if
something went down where would you go
where's your exits who would protect you
who would be dangerous you're never
really comfortable are you suddenly you
see a gentleman Who's acting up and he's
acting up in a way that looks dangerous
and he's making some threats and you're
looking at the faces of the men in the
car and you're pleading with them with
your eyes and you're saying please if
this gets worse will one of you do
something because he's bigger than I am
and and I can't control this situation I
can't leave I'm trapped I'm afraid and
then you look at the faces of the men
and they're looking
away every time you look at a man he's
trying to not look at this
guy if this guy attacks me will these
men help me what will these men
watch what what is
2023 I don't know what year it
was am I
dead if this guy wants to hurt me are
they just going to
watch and now I'm really afraid because
he's starting to act up he's starting to
make
specific threats against other people
and he's big enough that he can make it
happen and make it happen
quick and the men are not
moving they're not
moving I'm
dead I'm going to die right now because
nobody's going to stop this
man and then one man stands
up I found out later his name was Daniel
Benny and he
acted I don't know why the other men
didn't but when he acted a few others
came to his assistance somebody had to
go first there was one leader on the
car and a few
followers but there was only one
leader fortunately I found out later
that this wasn't an accident he had been
trained he had been in the
military and he was trained to go toward
danger not away from it
and the only thing that holds Society
together ladies and gentlemen is the
fact that some men are trained to go
toward
danger if you didn't have them we
couldn't be in this courtroom having a
conversation you couldn't ever get on
that car and take a ride to work and be
safe you need to know that if somebody
acts up there's going to be somebody
near by probably a man but doesn't have
to be who's going to go toward the
danger instead of away from it that
ladies and gentlemen is the only thing
that holds civilization together if you
want to get rid of that you're going to
get rid of the very fiber the fibers and
fabric that keep America whole the
moment you can't depend on a big man
coming toward danger everything's
gone everything you can lose your life
your job your family everything you like
about this country is dependent on this
one very fragile thought it's not even
the physical thing it's a
thought and the thought is
this it's better if I go toward that
danger as soon as you take that away
from our system the whole thing falls
apart we become like other countries
other countries that can't figure out
how to pull it together countries that
can't run a legal system it's the basis
of everything the moment our legal
system isn't trusted or isn't part of
the solution nothing else works the
legal system and the threat that strong
men or strong women will come to the
rescue of people who are in trouble in
public and even in private if you take
that away from the United States we've
got nothing left everything everything
depends on that one fragile thought if
somebody comes after you the people
around you will stop
it ladies and gentlemen this is a little
bit about this one situation and we all
see that it's also about the bigger
situation because this is in the news
everybody's watching everybody who sees
this is going to be affected by it if
Daniel Penny goes to jail for trying to
help the next one isn't going to
help let me look you in the eye
every one of you in the
jury and here's what I want you to say I
want you to look me in the
eye and I want you to tell me that
you're okay being a person who removes
the most vital thought in American life
that if somebody comes for you we're
going to
help if you take that
away just know what you're doing you
can't get it back
So Daniel peny is way more way more than
a case about one man who killed one man
in an accidental presumably
accidental um Act of really an act of
love it was an act of love for his
fellow
citizens didn't work out and it was a
tragedy but you don't want to throw away
the good because there was something bad
that happened this one time ladies and
gentlemen I depend on you to keep
America
solid if you remove this
pillar we're all in
trouble so that's how I'd do
it I hope that Daniel penny has a good
lawyer I was listening to a story that I
would like you all to ignore me on
meaning that I'm going to say some
things in the medical domain and you're
really really really need to ignore me
on this one
okay do not take anything I'm going to
say as being
true it's just where my head's at so
there's a story about two women who had
breast cancer they I think they got
surgery to get rid of the tumors or
whatever but then they turned down the
follow-up work that I think would have
been chemo and some other drugs and some
other things because they didn't like
where the side effects were pointing but
uh so far they're fine you know number
of years have gone by and they seem to
be fine I can't conclude that they're
fine now here's what I want to tell
you if what you hear is me telling you
not to follow the advice of doctors I'm
not saying
that I'm not saying that I'm saying I
was I was putting myself in their
position coming off of the
pandemic and a doctor says to you all
right in this sit situation U the rules
say usually there's some kind of you
know employer and uh my employer my
hospital my HMO wherever says that in
these conditions uh we should use these
treatments it's one of these three
treatments big one and here's my
question how do those doctors know those
are the right treatments well you'd say
science obviously uh every drug has been
studies but I live through the
pandemic all of you did
too when somebody says a drug has been
studied does it does it hit you the same
as it did before the
pandemic doesn't hit me the
same today I say to myself okay who in
the world would have enough money to do
a you know a multi-million dollar study
about a drug that's going to benefit one
company
that
company
so is there any
independent data on any of these
products my guess is no meaning that
there is no you know
popular probably there's probably no
popular treatment for uh for
cancer that has been studied by
independent anything probably just the
people who make the drugs study it and
tell you it worked now when they tell
you that the cancer drug
worked are they telling you that it
cured it and you go home and you're
good mostly not you know there there's
lots of different Cancers and lots of
different things going on but mostly
they're slowing it
down now combine everything you know
about the
pandemic with everything you know about
how drugs are tested by only the company
that's going to make millions of dollars
if it gets approved
and then you throw on that it doesn't
cure it now if it cured it you'd be
pretty sure it was
working because you'd say the people who
didn't take it they died the people who
did take it blah blah but what if all it
does is extend your
life do you think that they can really
sort that out like we get got them an
extra year because I'll bet you there
are no two cancer patients who do the
same
things and I don't know sort all that
out if all you're looking at is you know
somebody bought two extra years and
that's the only thing that drug is doing
for you got you two extra
years but it made all of your years bad
so from day one you know you had side
effects you were tired your hair fell
out whatever it
was do you think you would
trust a study that was funded by the
company that makes millions and only
them nobody else and is said it gave you
two extra years when you knew that every
single person who used it was in a
different
situation so you're not entirely sure if
you even isolated the effect of that one
drug because they're probably on three
different drugs they might be on 10
different drugs because they might be
slamming vitamin D and b12 because
somebody told them to do it they might
be trying any one of you know a million
things that are in the media of like oh
somebody tried this and you know it's
all anecdotal there probably aren't two
people who are in the same situation so
can you really even know if those drugs
work now here's where I have to be
careful I would talk to your doctor not
me you definitely don't want to get your
uh your your cancer advice from me but I
think there's a real crisis and medicine
and and the pandemic uncovered it in a
way that we've never seen before you
always knew that it wasn't
100% that if your doctor told you to do
something it was a good idea but I feel
like I've taken it from 100% down to
60% meaning I'd still take the doctor's
advice in all likelihood but it doesn't
feel like a 90% anymore feels like
better than a coin
flip but not super better than a coin
flip for a lot of different categories
so I'm just going to put that out there
but listen to your doctor don't do
anything
crazy I just I just don't trust anything
anymore US government says according to
wired that relying on China for there
are lithium batteries for networks and
stuff is really risky but I'm going to
give the counter to
that I think that there is zero chance
that the United States and China could
enter a shooting war that lasts you know
you could imagine there might be this
skirmish over an island or something but
in terms of a major war between the two
countries almost
impossible almost impossible and it's
because we're too
economically
tied so yes it'd be better for us if we
didn't have to depend on them for
lithium batteries but on the other hand
it's probably this depending on each
other for everything that makes us not
go to war has it have any countries ever
going to
war um have any countries ever going to
war when they were highly dependent on
each other for their
economies in the modern world let's just
say last 50 years is there any country
that want to war with their own
customers is that even a
thing I
wonder yeah so it seems to me that the
the risk with China as long as we have
you know this need for the rare earth
materials and they need stuff from us
which is we need to buy things from them
for them to stay in business I don't see
how we're going to have a major
war and but also China doesn't need a
major war to someday control the world
if they think their population is going
to grow stay bigger than the rest China
really just needs to manage their
situation
well and given the just pure number of
people that should put them in the
economic dominant position eventually it
might take a hundred years but whoever
has the most people and you know all
that land should be the dominant country
in a 100 years no matter what else
happens so it doesn't make sense for
China to start a war it doesn't make
sense for us to start a war makes no
sense whatsoever to be in a war with
with Russia um War doesn't make any
sense anymore it it only makes sense for
the the terrorist type you know Yemen
hoodies kind of weird things and you
know some special cases like Russia
trying to keep uh you know keep NATO and
of Ukraine so Ukraine's have a special
case
but um I don't remember that we were
buying a lot from
Ukraine and I don't remember I mean even
though they were enormous in terms of
food and
trade um it feels
like we absorbed that economic hit
pretty easily I don't remember anybody
starving because Ukraine couldn't make
enough wheat weren't we supposed to run
out of wheat because it's like the Bread
Basket of Europe and then what happened
did just somebody grow more wheat so
what happened to losing the Bread Basket
of Europe it's like we don't talk about
it so I don't know what happened there
anyway I'm not worried about the big
countries wanting to go to war because
they just don't have any reason it's
just all
downside um and I'm not sure that was
always the case according to LinkedIn
and the post Millennials
reporting uh the older job Seekers from
60 to 78 are looking for jobs I am not
surprised whatsoever that seems like the
natural outcome from the economy
starting to fall apart is the older
people looking for
jobs so tomorrow here's a announcement
so tomorrow will be two weeks Tuesday
night tomorrow two weeks until actual
election day uh I'm going to live stream
uh in the evening tomorrow at 900 p.m
eastern time my local time that would be
6 p.m. and it will be in place of my
normal uh man cave that I do usually
that's just for subscribers but this
will be open I'll do it on all the
platforms and all I'm going to do is
fill out my uh voting ballot I'm not
going to show it to you I'm not going to
tell you who to vote for I'm just going
to keep you company and so if you got a
little bit of ADHD and you keep telling
yourself I'm going to do it I'll get to
it I can't remember where it is just
find your ballot just find it and then
if you want to join me
um fill it down at the same time I won't
see yours you won't see mine but we will
just be Patriots at the same time and uh
this wouldn't really
matters I've never done this before in
fact honestly I've never gone out of my
way to tell people to vote because I in
the past uh you know pre-trump it never
seemed like it
mattered now it matters now now I feel
like I'm doing
something uh that has
purpose so we're just going to have fun
uh it won't last that long probably I'll
take some questions do do some usual
stuff but it won't be much uh much
entertainment we'll just keep you
company and we'll just fill out our
ballots at the same time and mail them
in now I remind you that if you're in a
state like I am California and you say
to yourself but Scott my vote doesn't
matter oh yes it does oh yes it does
because if Trump doesn't win not just
the electoral college but also the
overall National vote he's not going to
have the credibility he needs he's going
to have to just scream through the
voting on this he he's going to have to
dominate the swing States but also
cleanly win the national vote otherwise
it's just trouble we need we need
Californians to say well even though he
didn't win in California it's the most
he's ever gotten there
well maybe he didn't win in New York but
oh my God was it close you know what I
mean so there's no such thing as a swing
state anymore they're all swing States
everything's swinging but for a
different purpose it's but they're all
swinging so get over your idea that you
live in a state where it doesn't matter
it all matters this time and this is
different it's not like other times
other times honestly it didn't matter
and I've said that myself I've said
didn't really matter this time this
matters as much as anything has ever
mattered in the United States this is
the highest level of oh my God it
matters you can't get higher than this
much mattering so so do what you need to
do according to the Daily Mail Harris
has a huge huge lead in uh older women
over the age of
50 um even more than Joe Biden did so
the older women they love her what do we
know about older women in the United
States um they're on
anti-depressants if you would like to
not be on anti-depressants maybe vote
the other way this time maybe maybe vote
for the guy who's got a plan to get you
off of
anti-depressants RFK Jr better food
better
exercise better better Pharma yeah if if
your problem is your own mental health I
think Trump can help you with that a lot
more than anybody else can because the
team he's bringing into
it all right uh let's talk about the
fake polls Washington Post still has
Harris winning the Electoral
College Simon rosenberg's talking about
this on
X
um the very next story all right here so
here are the stories that are next to
each other the Washington Post has
Harris winning the Electoral College
which means winning the election the
very next story is that Trump opens a
10-point lead on Harris in according to
modernity in a major
forecast um in the decision SQ the hill
forecast Trump has a 52% chance of
winning versus
42 right so Washington Post say Harris
winning the hill and the decision HQ
have Trump winning
handily now do you remember what I told
you about the
polls what we're going to see is two
phenomenon that are both fake but
they're fake in a different way so the
original polls didn't have to be
accurate because nobody had voted yet so
nobody could tell if they were
inaccurate under those conditions many
of the polls operate as propaganda
so in order to raise
money your friendly pollster says my god
look how good you're doing if you just
had a little bit more money it would put
you over the top you would win and then
the money people say well perfect this
is a good use of my money because it's
so close that my money could make the
difference so if you want to raise money
you got to show that it's
close if you want to be credible as a
pollster you got to get it right
so you're going to move from an area in
which simply making it fake look like
it's really close is what everybody
makes money from everybody gains that
way just more money flowing around yeah
it's close it's close you better you
better uh get another poll why why don't
I sell you another poll result we'll do
you a private one yeah it's so close
you're gonna have to study everything so
everybody's benefiting by fake too
closed polls now what happens when you
get get close to the actual election
well you got two kinds of pollsters one
kind of pollster wants to remain
credible so they they Converge on the
accurate as they know it answer so that
when the actual election happens they go
well you know it's a good thing we
updated it from our summer numbers that
are way off but when we got to the end
apparently the public changed no it
wasn't it wasn't us it was the public
the public changed their votes no no it
wasn't the way we measured it no don't
look at us don't look at us don't look
at us the public changed their mind
because because uh Trump sold some
french fries yeah that that's it that's
it that's it there was a big move at the
end because Trump sold french fries at
McDonald's and that probably moved a lot
of Voters so that's why we move from
being you know saying he would lose to
saying he's going to win at the end so
now that would be the honest pollsters
because they're trying to hit the
polling number and and the actual result
being as close as possible and then
there's the Washington
Post there should be some pollsters who
will maintain that it never it never
left um too close to call the reason
they would do that is presumably now
this is speculation based on observation
that they're part of the cheat now if if
there are in fact and this is
speculation if there are in fact
entities within the Democrat Party that
are planning to cheat and uh and they
want to get away with it the only way
they could get away with it is if some
of their some of their illegitimate
press and illegitimate pollsters say it
was too close to call so how can you
even say it was cheated we don't even
know who was supposed to win it was too
close to call and then others will say
but but but these other polls said it
wasn't close at all Trump was totally
going to win and then they'll say but
but but the Washington Post said it was
going to be close but the Washington
Post is the loudest
noise the people who are pollsters but
do not own media are just going to be
complaining but the Washington Post will
write story after story telling you that
it was too close to call and so
obviously it's a clean race because the
courts have not shown that there were
any problems because the courts are not
the right tool to do it and they don't
have time to do it and people don't have
a stand and they want to stay onative if
they can so the story will
be that there were big polls that said
it was going to be close it was in fact
close and if you think there were some
irregularities well that's always the
case there's always some irregularities
and we found a few but they didn't they
weren't enough to change
anything but what if there were more you
won't know no way to know if there were
more more ones that didn't get caught
you won't have a way to know
so it does look in every way like the
the fixes
[Music]
in but don't blame Dominion voting
systems they have warned us in an expost
um this this so this is from Dominion
Dominion is closely monitoring claims
around the November 2024 election and
strongly encourages use of verified
credible sources of information so what
would be a verified credible source of
information according to Dominion
um probably the Washington
Post and the New York
Times maybe uh Time Magazine the
Atlantic uh
MSNBC
CNN
okay so your credible and my my credible
might not be the same but um Dominion
says we remain fully prepared to defend
our company and our customers against
lies and those who spread them get the
facts so in other words they're going to
take you to court if you tell a lie
about their company now if I were
Dominion I would do
this this is the right play so from a
business perspective warning people that
if they get too far over their skis and
accuse them of something without proof
they're going to be in a lot of trouble
basically they're going to be broke
they'll break you so I want to be as
careful as I can in saying this I'm not
personally aware of any specific
problems with Dominion or other voting
machines at the end of the
election even if there are very reliable
sounding claims I won't
know because I guarantee you that 95% of
the claims of election fraud will be
fake they will be fake and indeed many
of the ones that you already have seen
and already believe are credible
probably a lot of them are fake I don't
know if all of them are but probably the
majority so keep these two things in
mind you will never probably know
probably never know if any specific
claim was valid either because the
courts dragged their feed or somebody
lost the records or whoops we forgot to
we forgot to make a backup you know all
the things that you've seen every day
you're seeing the same thing every day
it's the same play oh we lost that oh
that record is wrong oh the videotape
got
overwritten so it seems unlikely that if
there were any irregularities that it
would be solved in any organized way I
don't think we have a system that could
solve things in time even if they were
surfaced but I don't believe that the
voting machines need to be a part of any
cheating because we have overseas
ballots coming in without ID
requirements and they can email their
ballot you can email a vote from
overseas without proving you're overseas
now let's say a whole bunch of people
just speculating again imagine a whole
bunch of people voted illegally
overseas how long would it take to catch
them and verify that they were all
illegal votes well let me tell you how
that would go well these votes came from
lots of different sources and we're
following up as hard as we can but it's
going to take some time well I mean you
only have until January
six I know I know but well we're trying
as hard as we can but turns out the
people we need to talk to are on a two
we
vacation oh but they're coming back
right it's just because of Christmas
yeah yeah yeah yeah so so now you
studied all the people in Europe that
voted no no no oh my god there were
millions of them how are we going to
call millions of people in just a few
weeks with all the vacations and
Christmas and everything and then we'll
say but you need to you need to because
if you don't we won't know who won but
we don't have time well we're taking
this to the courts and the court says
well what do you got well we found so
far 2500 people who voted overseas that
are totally not eligible to vote and
then the court will saywell what was the
margin of victory
uh well the margin of victory was
500,000
people so basically what you're giving
me is something that wouldn't change the
result yeah yeah but we think there's a
lot of it but you've only found 2500
yeah yeah but we don't have time because
there were millions that we need to
check and you'd have to you know catch
up to them you'd have to compare their
vote you'd have to find out if they're
real you'd have to visit them in person
to find out if they're even real people
um check their
IDs and then the court says you know
what I can't deal with this because you
haven't shown me it would change the
result and the courts don't like to get
involved if no result is going to be
changed you don't have a per you've just
got names in Europe and that's not my
jurisdiction and the court is going to
say I got nothing I can't I can't help
you so the only thing you need to do to
get away with
cheating is to have a system which is
sufficiently
distributed that if anybody looked into
it and they found the cheating and they
found it they wouldn't be able to find
enough in time to change anything and
then once the new administration's in or
in power what do they do they put their
attorney general in charge and then the
Attorney General says I think all the
claims of election interference are
overblown Let's uh let's leave that
alone there is no
way to reverse this the if if in fact
and again this is just a worry it's not
something I have proof of but if we get
a whole bunch
of suspicious votes from
overseas there's no way to stop it it's
a perfect cheat and we see it in
advance we see it in
advance now how could we ever have a
real election under our current
circumstance where one one candidate has
been likened to uh Hiller so many times
and people literally believe he's going
to steal your
democracy and the only thing you do have
to do according to their view of things
to save
things is to email to email the vote
that you're not allowed to
make how many people would say well if I
can save the world I guess I could send
a fake
email I don't know not much of an
election this time well Trump went to
McDonald's you all know um some people
said ah it's fake because the all the
cars were vetted and and they even
trained for the interaction well of
course they're
vetted the president said at least two
assassination attempts of course they
made sure that the that the cars that
went by the the windows were not
ordinary customers the the only thing
they got was french fries they weren't
even real orders because if they wanted
more than french fries all they got was
from Trump was a bag of french
fries but he did it
perfectly um nobody can do that better
than Trump he does his he can chatter
with everybody he just made it look
comfortable and fun and kind of ironic
and iconic and just everything that
Trump does
it it was sort of bringing together all
the best of you know if there's any best
thing he does it's that it's it's
interacting with ordinary people in a
way that is interesting to people
watching I mean nobody does that better
so who knows if it changes any votes but
it certainly made him look good and
helped his uh I think he won the day you
know they're talking about winning each
day in politics he won that day um but
you do have to ask what did RFK Jr and
Nicole Shanahan think about Trump
boosting fast food at
McDonald's and that's a good question
that's a good question politically I
think it was
brilliant um
medically we can do
better all right I'm going to uh anger
you on this 60 Minutes thing as you know
uh 60 Minutes edited uh at least one
answer from Comm
Harris to make it less word sality and
more coherent and people said you dirty
60 Minutes you're in the bag for KL
Harris you are not allowed to edit it
show us that complete complete uh
unedited document so we can see how
badly you edited it all right what I'm
supposed to tell you is as 60 Minutes um
is influencing the election and they
fake news and everything else um I don't
see it so let me tell you something that
most of you didn't know when you read
the
story for the big Publications where
there is editing editing for time and
that would include a print
story where they don't want the print
story to be as big as a book so it's got
to be
smaller um and uh certainly if it's
televised and ask if at a certain time
then it's always edited now I have been
the subject of many many interviews
hundreds thousands at least at least
many hundreds I don't know how many over
my career and I can tell you that the
most typical and normal thing is that
they will edit your
comments and they edit them if your
comment is sort of it goes on a little
bit but there's a bit of it that says
the core part
it's very common that they'll cut out
the part where you just run on a little
bit long and and they'll keep the part
where you summarized it and set it just
right here's why they do that it's
better to
watch as a viewer you would appreciate
it because you didn't need the word
salad you just needed the the summary or
the part that set it right this is a
very ordinary thing so when 60 Minutes
admitted that they they edited one for
tightness I looked at it and I said to
myself did they get rid of something
that was like the opposite of what she
said because if they changed it from
saying yes to no well I mean that's
almost a crime isn't it but if they
changed it from yes to hell yes or yes
to yes but just the words are
changed that's just what they always do
that's actually normal so I'm going to a
contrarian on this having been the
subject of many edited uh interviews and
I will tell you that if the entity that
is doing the editing um is doing a hit
piece such as Bloomberg did on me once
during 2016 I think um their edits of me
were to make me look
bad when I did the Playboy interview
back when Playboy was a much bigger deal
back in the 90s I was a the featured
interview in the Playboy interview and
when I read the interview I barely
recognized my own
speech it was so heavily
edited that uh if you played my actual
tape next to the you know to the ren
part you would be shocked how heavily
edited it was but did I complain I did
not do you know why I didn't complain
because they edited it to make me look
smarter they they simply they kept the
places where I said exactly the right
thing just the right way and maybe if I
you know coughed or hummed or said
something twice when I only needed to
say it once they just fixed it so when I
read my own interview I I remember
thinking oh my god did they make me look
smarter than I actually am that's normal
now the the the Playboy interviews are
not meant to make anybody look bad they
don't do they don't do HIIT pieces they
do pieces that you want to read so it'll
be about somebody that you wanted to
read about and it'll be mostly positive
things so when you see this 60-minute
interview and you see the edit you don't
know if they were acting um in a
malicious
way the only thing you can know for sure
is that they acted in a typical way the
way any other media would have acted in
that same situation now since
Harris is known for word salad and she's
running for president that the word
salad or the lack of it is really
important in this context so in this
context I do think it's a little
illegitimate to cut it
out but if you imagine that what was
going on is that the people who do the
normal jobs did the normal jobs there's
somebody whose job it is to add it if
the editor simply edited the way they
always edit without even thinking about
it without thinking about any bias or
really just nothing think about anything
except being a good editor it would have
looked just like this so that's the
problem you can't tell if somebody was
trying to pull a trick on you because
whether they were or whether they're not
it would look the same it would look
like they fixed it to make it look smart
because it's sort of what they do they
do it to me they do it you if they liked
me they would do it to
me so you can certainly say that it's
not
ideal but to say this 60 Minutes was
necessarily glaringly and obviously
biased is not an evidence that is not an
Evidence it's certainly possible it's
possible that they edit it with an eye
toward making her get elected very
possible but it's not an
Evidence so I can't go there with you
all right
um here's another fake news I hate to be
defending K Harris against fake news but
there's another one so she was doing an
event talking to an audience and some
Heckler came in and the Heckler said
something along the lines of you know he
started yelling what about Israel's
genocide now genocide is the word chosen
by the Heckler right what about Israel's
genocide what about 19,000 children dead
now he said more than those two
sentences but among them
were Israel's genocide that's his take
on it and
19,000 children dead now um security
immediately had the guy taken out and
then K Harris's comment immediately
after his out she said quote what he is
talking about is real and I respect his
voice so that got reported as that she
is sort of in favor of
genocide come
on
really or or or or that she no not she
was in favor of genocide but that she
was blaming Israel for genocide I'm
sorry so forget the first thing I said
she's being blamed for accusing Israel
of genocide because she said of what the
protesters said uh that that is real and
I respect his
voice okay if Trump had been in this
situation here's what I would say he's
obviously not talking about the genocide
interpretation he's talking about the
fact that a bunch of people are getting
killed and good leadership could end
that faster so yes it's real that people
are getting killed a lot of them are
children and everybody would like to end
that faster it doesn't mean she agreed
with the characterization of genocide
and by the way I don't know if she
does so so if you have some other source
where she has said oh it's genocide then
I would I would revise my opinion but to
me she did not Embrace everything the
guy said I think she was embracing the
fact that people are getting killed and
a lot of them are you know Innocents and
children so um I don't think I want to
get into a question about what is
genocide and what is not because were
all talking about the same thing I I
feel like you enter
stupidville if you're if you're looking
at the same thing that everybody's
seeing the same thing and you're arguing
about the definition of
it
why it that's like trans when when I see
people arguing about whether somebody is
really a man or really a woman I say
wait a minute don't you both agree
completely on the facts of this case you
you both agree that a person was born in
one gender you both agree that the
person's preference is the different
gender you both agree that they're
identifying as the different
gender why are we talking about
definitions because we both are looking
at exactly the same
facts and and yet we found a way to
argue about it now you could argue about
what rights somebody has in the trans
situation but that and that's a good
argument
we we need to figure that out but you
shouldn't be arguing about whether or
not they are or are not a woman because
you're both looking at exactly the same
set of facts and you don't disagree with
them at all you know that somebody's
calling themselves a woman and you know
that maybe you don't like
it
so there's nothing else to say but you
can talk about what rights people have
that that makes sense anyway so talking
about whether Israel is doing a genocide
or they're just in a defensive War
why does the labeling make it
different do fewer people get killed if
he change the word for it uh are you
more in favor of it if you Chang the
word for it are you more against it
because you changed the word you're
using every single one of us knows that
Israel is trying to trying to kill all
of the Hamas
Fighters it would be to their advantage
israels to kill the fewest number of
non-combatants
but some of sometimes well often people
the non-combatants are going to die so
what part are we arguing about it's just
not even worth having a conversation
about what the word is if we're both
saying exactly the same
stuff anyway the biggest H hoax of this
election I'm going to call it the
biggest hoax and the biggest failure of
the Republicans in messaging is the
quote turn down border bill
now one of the reasons I say that Byron
Donald's uh is sort of a superstar among
Republicans is that every time this
topic comes up he goes to X and he posts
I think nine bullet points of why that
border bill was not what they said it
was now that's the right answer every
single time here's nine reasons that was
a fake if all you can do is say oh but B
but uh uh Trump was better at the
border but we we had a border bill that
would have fixed everything and Trump
turned it down for
politics oh oh but but but it was better
better during Trump I know I know but it
would have been great if we had a border
Bill and he' backed it instead he turned
it down for political reasons oh oh but
but oh the Border was better under Trump
and it just lets the hoax just sit there
the Border bill was a
hoax it it was
um even so Brett Bear even failed on
this because you'll get talked over if
you try to do it so remember when uh
Harris said during the Brett beer bear
interview said thatth but we tried to
get this border bill passed and Brett
interrupted her which didn't work out he
said yes ma'am it was called the US
citizenship Act of
2021 um and then bear described it as
essentially a pathway to
citizenship the main point of the bill
was to take the things that we want to
stop and are currently illegal which is
people coming into the country illegally
and simply make it
legal it wasn't stopping it it was just
changing the word for it so it'd be
legal it's the opposite of
stopping if it's encouraging
so here's how if you didn't know the
nine bullet points that were a problem
you should say it was a pathway to
citizenship Bill primarily and it was
doing the opposite of what we wanted
what we wanted to us to stop it and also
stop the incentive for it and also ship
back some number of people what the bill
would do is let people stay here make it
legal and increase the incentive for
more them to come because they see it
works
out so the the the fact that Republicans
completely
botched the messaging and argument on
this border Bill thing I don't think
there's a single Democrat who knows what
I just told you I'll bet none I'll bet
not a single Democrat has ever heard
that the Border bill was was really the
opposite of preventing people it was it
was designed to make it faster to
process people in I'm right about that
right when they said it was going to it
was going to increase the number of
Border people working it wasn't
increasing the number of people shipping
people back it was processing the number
of people stamping papers to let them in
it was literally to increase the number
of people coming in and and it would it
would make legal a number of entrance
like 1.8 million what what was the
number 1.8 million or something there
was some number of
annual entrance that was way above what
Republicans think is okay that was going
to be cified into law so it was
basically going to codify the all the
things we want to go away it was going
to Simply make legal and boost all the
bad things according to Republicans
again this is would be based on their
argument so the fact that that hoax got
all the way to two day two weeks before
election
and I saw honestly I only saw Byron
Donald's do a good job of trying to
defeat it but he's one person you know
there's not much he can do as one person
but he's the only A+ I'm giving out one
A+ and everybody else failed honestly
just
failed
um anyway so as you know Elon Musk is
giving away a million dollars per day to
some lucky person who signs a uh he's
got some kind of a petition he's taking
around when he's giving these talks in
Pennsylvania and if you sign the
petition saying that you favor free
speech um and gun rights and basically
the
Constitution um you could be eligible to
get a million dollars now the governor
has threatened to launch a criminal
investigation um here's what I know
because I used to work for a big
Corporation and every now and then one
of us would have the brilliant idea that
we could increase sales with some kind
of a contest and no matter what kind of
contest we came up with do you know why
we didn't do it we could never get it
past a
lawyer try this in your company if you
work for a big company you're a Fortune
500 company go to your boss and suggest
a contest for your customers that
somebody will win something if they're
one of the lucky people see what lawyer
says about that they're going to slap
you down so
fast and do you know
why there are a whole bunch of different
state regulatory restrictions on
contests and the reason is contests are
ways that people get ripped off so fake
contests are kind of a classic scam so
in order to make sure you're not a fake
contest you got to do a number of things
if it if if uh if mus didn't do the
things and it would be different in each
state then there's some small legal
liability not jail time but probably
some I don't know maybe some kind of a
fine or something so let me give you an
example um if you want to run a contest
in California and unless the law changed
this is what it used to be you would
have to show that you held the money
let's say it's money that you're going
to win uh in es
so you can't just say I will pay you a
million you have to have the millions
sitting there in a defined account that
is free from any other use can't be used
for anything ex except paying off the
winner and that's how you make sure it's
not a scam you you don't get to say I
will pay you you got to say here's my
money it's sitting here it's in this
protected account it cannot be used for
any other purpose this is your money now
do you think that musk needs to do that
well no because everybody knows that
musk will pay there's nobody thinks he's
not going to pay so you don't really
need it but it might be a law now the
law in Pennsylvania would be different
than California but if that's a law and
if he decided to skip it and I don't
know if either of those are true um then
there would be some you know
minor totally unimportant violation of a
minor law I guess so but there I think
there are other things like that there
are a few other you know Hoops you have
to jump through so he might be he might
have some trouble and of course if
you're worrying about money from
billionaires going into politics and
changing something you got to talk about
the Soros
family
and I just saw another picture of Alex
Soros with like demon eyes I don't know
is it just me
I'm seeing a lot of the people that I
call the bad guys you know the people
who seem to be on the same team of um
Bad actors on the Democrat side the
number them have crazy eyes is really
hard to
ignore and it could be just my my bias
maybe I'm just seeing them as having
crazy eyes when they don't but wow the a
lot of them have crazy eyes anyway dur
which is might be the biggest
publication in Germany um has musk on
the cover and it calls him Enemy Number
Two and shows some of his skin being
removed and underneath it is Trump in
other
words they're basically setting them up
for assassination which Elon Musk
noticed and he said with their
Relentless hit pieces Legacy mainstream
Media or are actively encouraging the
assassination of trump and now me is
that an exaggeration
no it's not that is not an
exaggeration to me it seems really
clear that uh somebody behind the
media and maybe just the medium himself
making their own decisions are creating
a situation that makes it very likely
that Trump is in trouble and so is musk
we hope their security is
excellent meanwhile Politico has an
article Prime priming you for the steel
now when I say priming you for the steel
in the election I don't mean that I have
proof of a steel what I mean is if
everything looks like they're setting
you up to steal it I wouldn't ignore
that now what you would expect is first
of all you'd have some fake polls the
ones you trust the least would show that
the that the election is close
Washington Post done the other thing
you'd have is you'd have people warning
you in advance what happens if there's a
fair a fair win for Harris but those
evil evil Republicans and especially
that darn old president ex-president
Trump if he tries to say that that
wasn't a good election they want you to
know that that is trouble and uh needs
to be dealt with and by the way the
thing you shouldn't think about is
whether or not the election was rigged I
would like you to not think about
whether the election is rigged I'd like
like you to think past it to how we will
punish the people who said it was
rigged the election hasn't happened yet
and they're already talking about how
they're going to punish you for claiming
it was rigged Dominion as I already told
you has now said publicly if you blame
their machines you're going to be
destroyed whether you're right or wrong
won't be relevant you will be
lawed just because it's real expensive
to go to court and now
and now you've got Politico setting you
up to say um if he if he loses Trump
here's how he might try to overturn the
20 24 election and install himself in
the White House do you see that word
install here's how they could have
written it if the election looks sketchy
here's what Trump might do to see if he
can get a better audit or a little
Clarity on who won wouldn't that be fair
is that an accurate way to St it no they
use the word
install it's a dictator word so they're
already creating Politico one of the you
more important political Outlets is Now
setting us up to think past whether the
election is real and all the way to how
to punish the people who say it's not
real am I supposed to ignore
that I mean that seems pretty clear
signal of bad things
ahead very
bad all
right but here's how I would have
written that article I would have said
the risk of shenanigans goes both ways
it is not a risk of what happens if
Trump loses and claims he won it is a is
a problem that no matter who wins the
other side is going to say that it was
fixed am I right it doesn't matter which
side wins they're both going to say it
was fixed we know that from 2016 very
clearly the it's the same people the
same people like Hillary Clinton and
Rasin and all those people will say it
was rigged if Trump wins so why aren't
we talking about that it works both ways
and he's ahead in the polls the real
ones so what happens if Trump wins and
Harris tries to install herself
anyway isn't that fair question but no
and we know that Jamie Rasin is already
talking about if Trump wins they're
going to not try to not certify the
election and
install Harris instead they're saying it
out loud and yet it didn't make it into
the
story let let's just hold that in your
mind the Politico knows that Rasin has
said out loud in public that if Trump
wins they have a plan to remove him from
office and install
Harris
amazingly and yet the story is about
what would happen if Trump makes that
claim I mean the the level of
shenanigans is I've never seen anything
like this well let's talk about Israel
um I told you there's some fog of
War a lack of clarity about whether netu
netanyahu's home was actually attacked
by uh Hezbollah and the current
reporting says there were three U
missiles
that went toward his home two of them
got knocked down and one of them created
minor damage but uh the net yaho family
had not been there for several days so
there was there was not bodily risk at
least on that day now remember it's
still fog of war is this
true is it
true that three three missiles were sent
from Hezbollah and um you know likely at
then yaho is being the target is it true
I don't know how would you know do you
believe stories that come from war zones
in the middle of a war if you believe
this
story that's a
mistake is the story true it might be I
mean it totally might be there's nothing
to rule it
out but is it
true um I would act like you don't know
one way or the other I would say it's a
coin flip at best because and I think
I've told you this
before in the context of
self-defense and Israel is operating in
self-defense as is the others would say
they're in self-defense too I suppose
but if you're operating in self-defense
you can lie all you
want it's
self-defense if lying gives you any
advantage when trying to defend yourself
absolutely Absol abolutely if you're my
Ally and I heard that you lied in the
context of Defending yourself I'm going
to Pat you on the back and say that was
a good lie good well done there you
protected yourself just like I want my
allies to do so I don't
care like I don't really care if it's
true I care if it
works so in terms of analyzing I'll say
well here's what it did it just gave uh
Israel a permission to take out the
leadership of
Iran so that's the only
story now they've already taken out the
leadership of Hezbollah and gone down
one or two levels of leadership the
leadership that matters is sitting in
Iran now until this I would have said
that if if they had taken out to the
leadership of Iran they would have gone
too far because you couldn't look at
something that was the equalent but now
that there's a
narrative might be true might not be
true but the narrative is that uh that
the proxy of Iran which you assume would
not do such a thing without permission
from the bosses which would be Iran have
tried to take out the head of
Israel this is a free
pass if Israel decides to take out the
leadership of
Iram they're going to say
you started it and we're not going to
know the difference whether they started
it or not in my opinion Iran would be
insane to have tried to take out
Netanyahu if you told me that Hezbollah
tried to do it and it made Iran
unhappy that would be very believable
because the hola people are taking
orders but maybe not on every missile
you know maybe they have sort of General
orders and you got some Rogues and maybe
the Rogues thought oh we'll end the war
by taking care of Netanyahu so it's
entirely possible that Hezbollah tried
to take out
Netanyahu it's entirely possible that
they did it with the approval and even
maybe help by the Iranian leadership but
it's also entirely possible that
Hezbollah really up and they
thought they were doing something maybe
that they wanted to do and maybe they
thought Iran would like it if it worked
but I don't believe that the Iranian
leadership has ever shown enough
stupidity that they would do
that because they just opened up you
know a doorway that they did not need to
open up because the the war would not
have stopped if net if Netanyahu got
killed it wouldn't have stopped it might
have gotten worse so how in the world
could have Iran have benefited by taking
out
Netanyahu that's the question you have
to ask but we will never know the truth
of this probably we'll never know the
truth we'll never know if Iran said yes
take out Netanyahu we'll never know if
Hezbollah did it and Iran was mad at
them um for doing it we'll never know if
these missiles really were not that
close to netan yasu's house but they you
know maybe exaggerated it so it sounded
like it was more dangerous you'll never
know because Israel has every right to
lie in self-defense as we all do and
it's not it's not a crime it's not a
moral it's not unethical it's nothing
you need to apologize for if you did
it so I don't believe the story entirely
but I don't disbelieve it I just don't
have any way to know it's true or not
true the only thing I know for
sure is that the the option of taking
out Iran's leadership is now completely
open
and that's never been the case before
now would taking out Iran's leadership
make things better or worse no
idea I'm pretty sure it's a good idea to
take out the leadership of Hamas and
Hezbollah that feels like you don't have
to be a military genius to know that
that's a good idea but the head of a an
actual you know un
State I don't know I don't know I
wouldn't be
surprised if Israel gets a clean
shot if they if they take it don't be
surprised I'd be surprised if it happens
before election unless they wanted to
use the election to say you guys are all
too too
distracted um and they wouldn't want to
change the election outcome so I don't
think Israel would want to um change
America's outcome by
some you know action in the next two
weeks because they would get blamed for
it they'd say you knew you knew if you
did or didn't do
this
yeah um so I
think Israel will not take out the
leadership of Iran before our
election but once our election happens
we're still not going to have a
president right even if we think we
elected one we're not going to have a
president um
because it'll take time to count and
we'll be disagreeing and everybody will
say the other side cheated and it'll be
in court and everything else so between
the election day and the actual day if
we ever decide who actually is President
that's probably where Israel would want
to make a
move because Trump can say I wasn't
president so I couldn't stop it nobody
will think Biden could have stopped it
and they'll say the vice president
wasn't in charge so we're entering a
period where basically nobody's going to
be in charge and We Know It And Israel
knows it too so if I were Israel and
again this is not a recommendation
because I'm no war planning expert but
it seems the most rational time to do it
would be between election day and
January
6 I hate to say it but if it's going to
happen that that would be the time to do
it it
so that is uh what I got for today do
you notice I have something behind
me um I'm going to I'm going to make a
probably a separate video on this but
people always ask me
Scott I know somebody who's a fan of
Dilbert or a fan of your other work and
I want to know what gift to buy them for
Christmas so I thought I'd answer that
if your friend is a Bert fan and they
don't care about politics or fixing
their career or anything like that they
just like the jokes then they should get
the 2025 Dilbert calendar which is now
reissued it was discontinued last year
but now it's reissued made in America
twice the comics it's got the
traditional um Comics that you always
see on the front pages but on the backs
of every page is the Dilbert reborn
comic that is only available normally to
subscribers and so you'll get twice as
many Comics as ever the only place you
can buy this is at the link dilbert.com
it is not going to be on uh any other
online or brick and mortar store the
only place you get it go to dilbert.com
and get the link if you buy it as a
pre-sale it's good for me so if you like
me byy now don't wait till December 15th
uh uh because they get printed on demand
the way we're banking them so you don't
want to run out by waiting too long and
the sooner you do it the better it is
for
me if you know somebody that you want to
give a gift to who's sort of a brainy
big thinker philosophy sci-fi kind of
person they will love the newly issued
God's debris which is now three separate
works it's God's debris which used to be
its own book it is the sequel as well
also now in the same book uh the
religion War very hard to find the
sequel and I've added a short story
called Lucky House Lucky House rounds
out the trilogy and uh a number of
people tell me this is the best book
they've ever read in their life that's a
real
thing all the time people tell me it's
the best book they've ever read in their
life now that was even the first God
debr people have been telling me that so
not every person is going to like every
book but this is a real good bet it'll
make your brain spin around in your head
wi biggly is the book I wrote um about
Trump's 2016 run and the influence he
used so if you want to give a book to
somebody that will help them be more
successful and happy I've got three
books one will teach you persuasion in
the context of how Trump used it but
it's all stuff you can use you could use
it immediately just read it and you'll
know how to do it this is the second
edition
so it's uh a little bit
updated if you've already read the first
one you don't need to read the second
one uh because it's just you know it's
just punched up a little bit um likewise
my book from 2013 had it failed almost
everything and still went big is the
still the OG book in the success domain
career or personal and this is the book
that's influenced a whole bunch of other
books so you'll see the work from this
book um in lots of popular books and you
might not recognize where it came from
but if you want to see the original work
that teaches about um systems over goals
and building Talent stacks and how uh
how uh chasing your um chasing your uh
what do you call it your uh your joy or
something um is not so good just build
yourself a talent stack you'll be fine
and then more
recently this is the first edition that
came out in the in the last year reframe
your brain will teach you how to think
yourself into a happier and more
productive life without doing any work
at all all you have to do is read the
various reframes in the book some won't
apply to you doesn't matter but the ones
that do apply to you you might find them
completely spinning your thoughts around
to the point where things that were big
problems just go away and this can fix
problems in your career plan your mental
health your physical health
your your social life basically every
part of your um your life has at least
one reframe which is just a simple way
to look at something differently that
changes everything about it so if you
want a persuasion you want a plan for
Success professionally or personally and
you want to know how to change your
brain to get the best result I've got
three books that I guarantee you people
love
they really love these books so
entertainment on the left fix your life
on the right and there you are all right
