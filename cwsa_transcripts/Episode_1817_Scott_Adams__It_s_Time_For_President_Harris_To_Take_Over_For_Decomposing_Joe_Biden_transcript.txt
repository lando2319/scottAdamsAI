good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with scott adams and
aren't you glad you're here
you know we could call it coffee with
whatever your name is but
that wouldn't work nearly as well
maybe we should do that sometime i'm
going to pick a popular name
let's see there are probably lots of
people out there named
dorothy
so is coffee with dorothy today dorothy
it's your day
and all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that could even animate joe biden
it's called coffee
and it happens now go
ah
yeah that's good that's good
well
let's start with our first little bit of
gas lighting and this comes to you
courtesy of cnn now i made the mistake
of looking at the cnn website
and clicking on one of their links
here's what i found
on the front page this is what the link
says right
so the link says
um
cnn poll a majority of gop voters don't
want trump to be the nominee in 2024.
so that's what the link says
the link says most republicans
don't want trump to run so if you
clicked on that link what would you
imagine the story would be
do you think the story would be
something about
the republicans don't want trump to run
right
all right here's what the title of the
piece is after you click the link
so the link again
says republicans don't want trump to run
click the link and here's the headline i
swear to god i'm just reading this
off of cnn's own site all right i'll
click the link
all right republicans don't want trump
to be the nominee and then the story is
by kate sullivan
cnn poll 75 percent of
democratic voters
want someone other than biden in 2024
54 percent of republicans didn't want
trump running
75 percent of democrats don't want biden
running
the title to the piece is about trump
the headline of their actual story this
is cnn's own story they're not linking
outside their site this is all within
cnn
right now you can go look at this
yourself the story is the opposite of
the title the title tells you there's
something wrong with trump
the story is about something wrong with
biden
have you ever seen something that direct
isn't it just a link error nope it's not
a link error because the story does
include
the fact that the gop
54 of them don't want trump but it's but
it's a buried context within the larger
story
the larger story
is people don't want biden
i mean
how much of the general public let's say
the cnn viewers how many of them would
even notice this
do you think they would even notice
or would they just read the headlines
and say well
trump is unpopular in his own party and
would they just move on
it's amazing that they can do this right
in front of you
right in front of you and you know
shamelessly
are you worried about robots taking your
jobs
do you think robots will put us all in
at work in the future
well let me give you some context here
uh it's happened once before
robots already took all of our jobs once
well i'm i'm extending the definition of
robot
to let's say a farm tractor
and industrial
farming which is you know a lot of
machines involved
so as
i saw a
tweet from evil gnome 6
on twitter
and evil gnome 6 reminds us that before
the industrial revolution
80 of humans were working uh agriculture
and now it's one percent
so we went from 80 of the people having
a certain kind of job
and then you know machines and tractors
and everything made that unnecessary
and we we basically removed 80 of all
the employment on earth
but it didn't make any difference
we were fine
we just found other things to do
now do you remember um if you're a
certain age
you might remember that there were uh
there were predictions that television
you know the invention of television
would make the radio go away because you
know who's going to want to listen when
you can listen and watch
but what happened
well nobody saw rush limbaugh coming and
suddenly talk radio
makes sense suddenly if you're driving
and you caught in traffic oh yeah it
turns out the traffic is getting worse
and worse so we spend more and more time
in our cars
so radio is more important
so
predicting that
tv would kill radio that didn't work out
how about uh do you remember when
everybody said the computers would make
us a paperless office
so when you went when you went to work
you'd have your computer but no paper
it wouldn't need any paper
yeah
let me show you my paperless office here
here here's my paperless office the
papers all over it
papers papers
yup it's 20 22.
do you know what's the best way to
handle some things
paper
do you know why i printed out my notes
on paper
because it works better it works better
basically we are terrible at at
predicting what's going to happen
with these large societal things
so and also keep in mind that if robots
take our jobs
they also might make the cost of living
drop like crazy
so we can see the cost of energy
approaching zero with fusion someday
we can see the cost of labor
approaching zero because machines will
do it all
so
maybe you don't have the same access to
the same job you could have had before
but would you care
what if everything is almost free
yeah there's no let's say there's no
delivery costs anymore
because you just 3d print what you want
i mean you could imagine a world where
you could live on a thousand dollars a
year
you could
you could imagine living on a thousand
dollars a year and having everything you
want
it's not impossible
who knows what's going to happen but
we're not good at predicting the future
all right here's some more interesting
news apparently ukraine has blown up one
of their own major bridges
to keep the russians from advancing
i guess they probably we don't know for
sure but they probably used one of these
high mars systems
h-i-h-i-m-a-r-s
that the u.s provided
so these are long-range you know
accurate missiles looks like they took
out that bridge
but here is a question i ask you
have we reached a point
in which
nobody's ever going to be able to move
big equipment into another country as
long as that country that's being
attacked has access to these types of
weapons i don't see how the russians can
advance
if we're providing
these
accurate missiles because it doesn't
take too many missiles to disrupt the
supply chain does it
fail to blow it up in the initial
invasion here
uh
well anyway um
ukraine is saying that they've got only
you know a few of these highmar systems
they need at least 50 of them to hold
back the russian forces
and at least 100 of them for an
effective counter offensive
do we want ukraine to have an effective
counter-offensive
is that even good for anybody
i don't know if it's good for anybody
actually like literally anybody
you know there might be some people who
prefer to be ukrainian instead of
russian i'm sure that's a thing and vice
versa
but for the world in general i don't
know if we want ukraine to beat russia
do we
or do we just want to stand off so maybe
they'll
stop fighting
i feel like you want to stand off i
don't feel like you want a victory
i don't
i'm not sure if anybody's better off if
ukraine gets back that territory
are you better off
do do you think your life would be a
little bit better if ukraine gets that
territory back oh
i don't know
i don't know how it's going to affect
anything
except the people in that territory
so gas place gas prices continue to
drift lower
here's my question
why
does anybody know the answer to that
question
gas is getting cheaper
why
why
inflation no futures well but why are
the futures changing
yeah obviously it's futures but why is
it changing recession i don't know that
people are driving less are they
it's summer it should be up demand
should be through the roof
are people driving less
i don't know i don't notice it i feel
where i am the roads are just packed
to me it looks like more traffic than
i've ever seen in my life
like on just a wednesday in the summer
where i live
on an average just just a wednesday
there's more traffic than i've ever seen
any time i've lived here
so is it different where you live
m2 money supply dropped
i don't think we know i mean i'm looking
at your answers and none of them look
persuasive
so i mean what it tells me is that the
rise in prices was never real in the
sense that there was not an economic
force probably
it was probably just
the
the gougers could gouge so they did
that's all it was right
is the only thing we saw
price gouging because that because
nothing changed as far as i can tell
why is there not a national story
um something did change somebody says
instability
yeah i don't know
you think instability
things are more stable and that
therefore the risk was taken out of the
price
i don't know
that doesn't quite
that doesn't quite track for me
there's a lot of this uh stuff that's
happening in the economy that i don't
think we quite have a grasp on what's
happening here i i definitely don't
understand why gas prices are going down
because i'm not aware of anything
changing
um here's a question i saw a uh
a claim on twitter that the oceans have
been cooling
for
a while
and that would be the opposite of what
climate change says
how long did it take somebody to debunk
that
oh about 10 seconds
and do you know how you debunk it you
just change the start point
you just change the start point
if you pick your start point at a
certain point it looks like the
temperatures have gone down
or
are somewhat stable over a long period
of time
if you look at it from let's say june
and then compare june and prior years it
looks like it's way up
same data
same database
so the people have concluded it's
clearly getting warmer on the oceans
are standing right next to the people
who are looking at the same data
same data
they say i'm looking right at it it's
going up
no i'm looking right at it it's going
down
no i'm standing right with you
we're looking at the same data
it's going up
no i'm standing right next to you
shoulder to shoulder look at it same
data
now if we can't even agree with that
it's one thing to be looking at
different data right
we're looking at the same data
and we can't even figure that out
my god
doesn't that make you doubt just
everything
that what could be
it'd be one thing if one side was saying
the data is inaccurate you know which is
a separate argument
if you're not saying the data is
inaccurate and you're looking right at
it you can't tell if the numbers are
going up or down
that's pretty basic
up versus
down
that's where we're at
we can't tell the difference
literally
between up and down at least in terms of
prices
or temperatures
all right well um
here's here's a story that is kind of
weird
you know here's a major through line in
a lot of things is that the news is all
about a different use of a word
right so when biden says insurrection
he's just using a word wrong and trying
to make something out of nothing by
using a word
right um
you know the fine people hoax was a
better word the drinking bleach hoax was
about a word
um or
basically
everything's about where you find
is did trump want to find votes or not
so everything's about a word okay
so your context is
that the news is all fake
and the way that they make it fake is by
telling you that recession right the
recession doesn't mean what it used to
be
somebody somebody tweeted uh uh reuters
that i think on the same day or maybe
the same week
writers defined the recession as two
consecutive periods of negative growth
at the same time
reuters also
was reporting oh no you don't simply
look at two course of negative growth
it's a holistic kind of thing you know
the biden administration
take on it
now here's the thing
i actually totally agree with the biden
interpretation
i i think that
if you took the simplistic explanation
of a recession of just two periods of
negative growth that doesn't make sense
coming out of a pandemic
because coming out of the pandemic just
changed everything
right
so if you had if you had a temporary
you know a reset i shouldn't call it
that if you had a temporary depression
coming out of a pandemic it could be
that all of your
all of your assets and resources are in
pretty good shape
they just have to be spun up again
so
so i do think that the biden
administration is accurate and by the
way i would have defended trump for
saying the same thing
if trump had said this i'd defend it as
well
i do think this this specific case
just in this specific case you do have
to look at it holistically
right so i hate to agree
i hate to agree because they're sort of
weaseling the the thing
but it's not wrong that's not wrong i
think you have to look at it
holistically because it's weird that
employment is still good
right that was the part that was a
mystery but i got it i got the answer to
that mystery we'll talk about it
all right um
here's another example of
news being created out of a word the
news in the wall street journal which i
believe has been completely debunked in
my opinion this is not true
right i don't know
but in my opinion what i'm going to read
to you is a fake news story from wall
street journal who claimed that elon
musk had an affair that was their word
an affair and this is the word that's
going to be questioned here
an affair
with one of the founders of google
sergey brin's
ex-wife
now the reporting is that this alleged
thing which
musk and the woman involved and sergey
brin and basically anybody who knows
anything denies
denies
and then i believe it you know their
denials look incredible to me
but
here's the part that i'm not going to be
able to release on
the reporting from wall street journal
which i believe is false
says that the quote affair happened
during a time
that the sergey brin and his wife were
separated
but living in the same home
now let me connect the dots here for you
the wall street journal says
must have an affair
with somebody who is single
you see where i'm going with this
that's not a affair
that would be two single people having a
date if it happened which apparently it
didn't
do you know what an affair is i had to i
had to look up the definition because i
thought i was going crazy
i thought i was going crazy i go
did i
what the hell do words mean
i thought an affair meant
that somebody was in a relationship
and the person they were in the
relationship with was unaware that they
were doing somebody else
did we stop using the word affair to
mean that and now an affair is two
single people who are dating
just think about the fact that this
murdoch property the wall street journal
did a hit piece on musk in which the
entire
story first of all is probably based on
fake information
but even if it were true
the story would disprove their own
reporting
if it were true which it isn't
their own story the way they reported it
disproves their own conclusion
with no ambiguity whatsoever
am i wrong
the meaning of the word means
you're not single when it's happening
if you're single which is what they
reported separated means single
there's nothing here
so there's this giant hit piece that's
based on probably nothing that really
happened and if it really happened it
would still be nothing still be
 nothing
and it's a major story
how do you explain this other than
murdoch wants to blunt musk's
power
i feel like i feel like elon musk was
becoming um
too influential
in the news business
simply by tweeting and maybe taking over
twitter we don't know if that's gonna
happen but i feel like murdock was
feeling that his own this is just
speculation right i have no way of
knowing this but the speculation is
that musk is the you're going to be hit
with these hit pieces because
um the more powerful
musk's persuasion is
the less powerful murdoch's
fair you know entities that he uses
persuasion for
would be
this looks like a billionaire fight
what would you say i think is murdoch
versus musk and there's nothing else to
it
that's what it feels like
just speculation
well the pope has
gone on an apology tour
he's visiting canada to apologize for
the church's role
in well listen listen to this allegation
and i guess the pope is confessing and
apologizing so
i guess it's beyond an allegation so
this is history i guess
so
uh it's a pilgrimage of penance he says
to apologize to the indigenous
populations
for i guess the roman catholic church
from the 19th century through the 1970s
right so a long period of time more than
150 000 of the indigenous children were
taken from homes and put into
residential schools run by christian
churches
on behalf of the government
to assimilate them
they were taken from their families and
put in
put into residential schools which means
that they were literally took people's
kids from them
they literally took people's children
from them
and put them in residential schools
now
you know even even if we acknowledge
their they were well intentioned
yikes
um
but here's my question to the pope
it feels like a little bit of a slippery
slope to start apologizing for
the history of catholicism
at what point
do you feel you're done
if you start apologizing for things that
the
catholic church has done over
hundreds of years
where exactly do you draw the line
and say well i think we've apologized
for everything it's all covered now
i'm not sure you could ever be done with
that job
so
and you know if you're new to my content
let me remind you i'm pro-religion
so i'm completely pro-catholicism
pro-islam pro-you know buddhism
pro-religion because people do make
religion work for them and it you know
benefits their life
you know despite any uh abuses by the
organizations themselves
and i just think it's funny you you can
see how apologizing doesn't work right
even if it makes you feel good at the
moment
when when an entity like the catholic
church starts apologizing i just don't
know where you stop
at some point you just have to say yeah
we sucked in the past let's see if we
can get it right
a catholicism
somebody says it's pronounced
catholicism
that's not right is it
all right well it doesn't matter
um how many of you think that klaus
schwab
the person associated with a great reset
how many of you believe that he once
said that in the future you won't own
anything and you'll like it
how many believe that he said that in
the future
you won't own anything and you'll like
it
uh have you ever tried googling that to
see if that actually really happened
never happened
it's one of the most uh pervasive
beliefs on the right
never happened
nope didn't happen
i'll tell you what did happen that
people think happened
what he did say is in the future
you might have things delivered to you
by drone
that you would rent
that you would have things delivered by
drone
that you would rent you wouldn't own it
now he did say that right
am i right
he said you would have things delivered
by drone and that you would rent them
you wouldn't own them
right and and i'm agreeing with you it's
in a video
that things would be delivered by drones
and you wouldn't you would uh you would
rent them not on them
now what kinds of things can be
delivered by a drone
what do you think
what kind of things could be delivered
by a drone
well
i could think of let's say you needed a
specialized tool
or even a specialized medical device
let's say you needed a medical device or
like the other day i needed a tool to
check on my internet connectivity
so i wanted a special meter that would
tell me if my
if my ethernet jack was alive
did i need to own that
did i need to own that or if i if i
could called up a drone
to be there in an hour
with that tool
and i rented it and i put it back on the
drone and returned it would i be happy
probably
probably i'd be happy because i wouldn't
have to buy it
for something i would only use once
and
and i'd be happy
now here's the context
how do you get to the point where drones
are delivering things you can rent
what is the possible way you could ever
get to that future
i can only see one way
market forces
just market forces
they'll make the drones better
uh leasing is better than buying for
some types of products but not all
all i see is charles schwab's or not
charles schwab klaus schwab
all i see is him saying the obvious the
market forces will have us delivering
things that we rent and we'll like it
why wouldn't you like that it's just an
option
they didn't take away your ability to
own a tool
they just said you could get one for
rent
if you wanted
to to me this is just a statement of the
most obvious
market force
predictions
drones will deliver stuff he can rent
now how about owning a private
automobile do you think the world
economic forum wants you to not own a
private automobile
probably
probably yeah yeah i agree
do you know what's going to make that
happen
market forces it's not going to be them
yeah the the minute i cannot own a car
i'm all over it
the minute i don't have to own a car and
i can still get anywhere i want i am
getting rid of my car
that day
the day i don't need a car it's gone
right
now you might say no i love my car and
i'll bet you get to keep it
i'll bet you get to keep your car for a
long time probably your whole lifetime
but at some point it just won't make
sense to own a car
it won't make sense for you as a
individual
you know you can use your garage for
something else
so what i see with this old klaus schwab
thing
is that he talks about
market forces
delivering us a different kind of
society that we would enjoy
but not taking away all our options just
giving us more options and it would
move in a certain way
now
so somebody says here it is here's the
video
now
i can watch the video but remember i
just agreed with you what it says
so watching the video doesn't move our
argument forward
because you're saying and i'm saying the
same thing he did say
that you'll rent things in the future
he did say that we're all agreeing on
that so i don't have to see it
but what's it mean
he didn't say we're going to introduce
some communism so you can't own things
market forces alone will make you not
want to own a car
i already don't want to own a car owning
a car is the worst deal in the world
it's terrible
right unless you love cars then it's
fine it's more like a hobby
all right
but anyway i would uh i would ask you to
do this
whenever you see any kind of klaus
schwab
reset stuff
just just take a look at the debunks
you know just google it
uh because i think you've got that story
at least some of you have that story
completely wrong
feels like it to me
um yeah so
they predicted the world economic forum
i guess that by 2030 people would rent
what they needed and
they'd be happy about it
i don't know
andres backhouse tweeted today there's
some stats coming out from germany the
consumption of natural gas in germany
was down over 19 compared to 2021
and even more compared to the 10-year
average
and consumption in 2022 is down 14
almost 15 percent
and as andres points out if it continues
the eu gas saving targets might be
feasible
so
the the eu is looking to fairly
drastically
cut back on gas production and it looks
like it might be doable
it might be doable
so
here is another application of the adams
law of sloan between disasters and it
and it gets us to an edge case
the only other edge case that was kind
of clean was the year 2000 problem
when we thought the computers couldn't
handle the year 2000 and society would
break down
i felt like people didn't get serious
about fixing that until a year before
it had to be fixed
but in one year
it was completely fixed
i don't think there was a single problem
that i heard of right so it feels like
the the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters if it's software
could be you know fixed in a year
software is easier to fix
but
what happens when you you know let's say
a year in advance
ish
that you might have to cut back your
energy production by 20 or whatever the
guideline is
d is a year enough for people to change
all the things they do enough
to cut back 20
and i think the answer is yes
it looks like the answer is yes that
people can cut back twenty percent if
you give them enough time and
adjustments and they know they have to
do it
yeah if you have covert going on
um
but this is sort of semi-post coven
likewise germany just said it's going to
fire up three more nuclear plants
if this sounds like a repeat
it's three more so they already
announced they were going to reopen some
plants
and they just they just announced
three more are likely to be reopened and
apparently they can do it quickly
apparently they can do this in a year or
so because they're already built they
just have to be fired up
does adam's law apply to lake mead
the answer is yes
in the sense that
will california run out of water
i think not
but i don't know how we're going to
avoid it
frankly i have no idea how we're going
to avoid running out of water in
california
but we do have time to figure it out
so i think we'll figure it out but who
knows
anyway
all right
anyway germany looks like it'll be okay
despite how
how putin's
you know threat to them is pretty
serious i think they'll be okay
here are two new stories that are
happening at the same time and we're
pretending that they're not
number one the january 6 story is that
trump was allegedly too slow
178 minutes too slow
in speaking out against the protests and
the potential violence
and that and that of course was during
the fog of war
when trump probably didn't know exactly
what was going on because nobody did
um so that's one story that trump was
too slow
now nobody's saying that he did the
wrong thing when he acted because he did
tell people to be you know be
non-violent
but
the complaint is it took too long
all right so that's one story
trump took too long
minutes actually too long
second story which we're going to
pretend is unrelated to the first
is that insiders are complaining that in
the byte administration
biden is putting off important decisions
for as long as a year
right so trump
can't be president the democrats say
because in the fog of war
it took him 178 minutes to act
and two of the major publications owned
that are
you know dominate the republi the
democrat world
the washington post and the new york
times have both debunked this
and but still that's the claim
that he waited too long to act minutes
minutes i say
he waited minutes to act
meanwhile joe biden puts off important
decisions for up to a year and nobody
knows why and they're really bad about
it well i'll tell you why he's not
capable
is there another reason
he's not capable
now here's a little
mental experiment for you
imagine if joe biden had been
in charge
when something like january 6 happened
you know not january 6 but something
like it
can you picture him in charge
and making quick decisions
when he puts off normal decisions for a
year
he's clearly not all there
and is a fog of war
and people are telling him competing
things
but just just put that in your mind
it doesn't go well
doesn't go well
have you seen the back-to-back videos of
biden speaking twice in one day
and how he looks like a completely
different person
one of them looks like oh
he's okay i mean we keep making fun of
him for being old but he's doing a good
job he's reading that prompter
looks looks like he's present he's in
the moment
and then you see the video from the same
day
and he's deranged his eyes are
are bugged and
he sounds like off
it's the same day
all right
you can't have a president who's not
even the same in the morning as the
night
does anybody understand what kind of a
danger that puts us in
that the president isn't even the same
person
in the beginning of the day as the end
of the day
at the end of the day he looks sort of
agitated and
not quite himself does he
is that the guy you want making some
world important decisions
it does yeah i don't know if it's a
sundowner problem and i don't know if
it's
uh that he did or did not get some meds
but
joe biden is not one person anymore
he's two people
i don't know which one's going to be
making the decision
if you told me that the first joe biden
the one in the video where he looks
fairly put together
if you told me he was making a decision
i'd say well i might not like the
decision but he looks like a guy who
could make a decision
right he looks like he's at least all
there
by the afternoon he clearly wasn't all
there
i mean humans can tell
you can tell if somebody's not all there
i mean that's not that hard
that's not a high bar you know you don't
have to go to a lot of medical school to
know when somebody's just not all there
that's that's not a high bar he's not
all there he also we all stand
right
so
it's time for president harris
i think i think republicans should just
stop acting like he's in charge
just stop pretending
and say we don't know who's in charge
but we need to have an investigation to
find out imagine if you would the
republicans
launched an investigation
to find out who's making the decisions
for biden
wouldn't you like to know
because i'm pretty sure i don't know
now
yeah
it'd be interesting wouldn't it we've
never had to do this before you always
suspect somebody's making decisions for
somebody else but this time you'd really
have to you kind of have to wonder
because remember when people thought
cheney was making decisions for bush jr
that matters do you remember when people
thought nancy reagan's
astrologer was influencing ronald reagan
that matters
that does matter
that's not irrelevant
not irrelevant
yeah so yeah let's let's look into that
find out who's in charge but as much as
i dislike uh kamala harris's abilities
she's at least sane
she's at least the same in the morning
as she is in the afternoon whether you
like it or not
i think it's time for harris to take
over
and by the way i don't even well maybe i
am i'm biased so i don't think this is a
political statement because i'm saying
replace him with somebody that's worse
worse in terms of you know more democrat
than the democrat
so i would be willing to take somebody
who's worse on policy and worse in a lot
of ways
just to know she's there
you know just to know she's all there
because the alternative is just scary it
seems random you don't know what he's
going to order
you know angry joe
so i think even republicans should be
calling for harris to take over
and if i were them i'd start taking
meetings with harris and skip biden
because you don't know who's in charge
right
if you don't know who's in charge and
you want to get something done are you
going to take a meeting with biden
i wouldn't i just say we're going to
meet with harris because we don't think
biden's capable
imagine if the republican said from here
forward we're not going to take any
meetings with biden because we don't
think he's mentally capable so we'll
take all of our meetings with the vice
president if she'll have us i mean
obviously she would immediately say i
won't take those meetings but you should
say we want to meet with them as soon as
possible but we like to be with harris
because we don't think that biden's in
control anymore
i mean it would be a political thing to
do but
it would be interesting
well the washington
post uh
is saying that the justice department is
investigating donald trump's actions as
part of his criminal probe of efforts to
overturn the 2020 elections blah blah
have you figured out by now that the
democrat plan is to keep trump
permanently under investigation for one
thing or another that didn't happen
it's pretty clear
that their plan is to keep him
criminally probed forever without ever
finding anything because if there were
if there was anything defined
i don't know if there's ever been a
better offended president in our life
this would be the one guy i wouldn't be
worried about finding out with something
after he became president
you worry about that with every
president don't you what happens if this
president gets in office and
you know a minute later we find out
something we wish we had known
how in the world could there be anything
about trump we don't know at this point
i mean that we could find out
that maybe could happen
all right
um have i ever told you before that the
democrats are really the woman party
the woman party
now you think of them as
you know the party of lgbtq and the the
party of
you know black americans and more
inclusiveness and you know of course
women but you don't think that is the
lead necessarily
but
in my opinion
the women are running the democrat party
and they've started to paint the
republicans as men
so here's a uh
tweet
from let's see who is this midas touch
so this is a democrat
group that tweets
and does other stuff um
and they're saying that republicans
they're they're characterizing
republicans this way as quote we're
going to make women our property turn
america into a dictatorship and raise
the nazi flag once again that's minus
touch right
um
and they complain that the media
is is complaining about the price of gas
instead of talking about
how the republicans are trying to make
women
their property
to which i say
you know republicans can be women
am i wrong
i'm pretty sure republicans can actually
be women
and
yeah
right here
so
it's amazing that somebody who's a
democrat actually
i think is admitting that they see it
this way that the democrats are the
party of women
and the republicans are the party of men
but
are there more
republican men than women
i don't even know that there might be
can somebody tell me that
if you just look at republicans only are
more of the voters women or men because
they're more women than men in general
right
is there
is probably more men because the the
you know the philosophy leads a little
bit male it does
it's changing quickly anyway but my
point is
i do think that the
somewhat accidentally
the republicans have been become the
the parent party
and the democrats have become the the
women party
because i don't think that the democrats
can do anything that women don't agree
with
here's your test
i don't think the republicans can do
anything
that women don't agree with
could could the republicans do things
that black voters don't agree with
yes they could
they could
could they do something that women don't
agree with
nope
not a chance
not a chance
am i right
right they wouldn't get away with it now
let's take that same argument to the
republicans
is there anything that republican
males
would not want to happen that could that
could happen
because there were enough other people
who wanted it
no probably not
i've got a feeling that the republican
party
does have a male bias
and that the democrat party does have a
female bias
but the republican party seems more
explicitly parental in nature
it's more about adults right
it's an interesting match-up women
versus parents and you can see it in so
many ways
well by more than four to one margin
according to rasmussen poll
americans say the nation's problem with
opioid drugs
fentanyl being the worst of them is
getting worse not better and they don't
think
biden is doing enough
so 44 percent of americans
believe that the crisis has gotten worse
and just 10 percent think it's gotten
better
how in the world could anybody think the
opioid crisis got
better
there's more drugs
10
crazy
oh another 16 are not sure oh
oh
let's see
10 percent think the opioid crisis is
getting better
16 are not sure
uh the math at 10 plus the 16 26 26
nearly a quarter
about about a quarter of the country
is bat stupid huh
well that's a surprise
all um
so biden's failing on uh
on that and i think that the the
here's a prediction that i will bank on
you know how follow the money always
explains everything
right
follow the money explains everything
if you look at the opioid in the
fentanyl situation
fall of the money tells you exactly
what's going to happen
number one
there will be more fentanyl shipped into
the country
why
why
because it makes money
so fentanyl shipments in the united
states are
profitable would you agree that there
will be more of them
of course of course so follow the money
guarantees will be more
not less fentanyl coming into the
country
now
have you heard of this thing called the
military industrial complex
we don't like it
we wish it didn't exist
but it does exist
it does exist and so you can't ignore it
and what would the military industrial
complex do
if the
potential
profit
from attacking the cartels went from
looks like that would be a smallish
operation what if it goes to a big
operation
suddenly the military industrial complex
says whoa a new line of business
attacking the cartels but it's got to be
big
like the scale of it has to be big
enough
that the military industrial complex can
get interested
right has to be big otherwise they don't
they don't make enough money
so the fentanyl business will keep
getting bigger
until
it crosses that line
the moment it crosses that line
the military industrial complex is going
to have a trillion dollar payday
because they're going to say you know
we're going to have to sell you some
really expensive weapons to take out
those cartels and to guard the border or
whatever we decide to do
so the two things that you can guarantee
is that there will be more fentanyl
coming in until the problem is so bad
that the military industrial complex
sees a huge profit
at which point they will vaporize
it will take a few years because you
need to spread that profit out
but they will vaporize the cartels
there isn't any other way this can go
because of money
right now the cartels will try to make
enough money to like you know change
something
but but money guarantees
that the cartels will be vaporized
am i wrong
it's just not profitable to do it yet
but it's getting close
yeah
let's say when fentanyl deaths reach 200
000 a year
which should be in a year or two
maybe five years
but there isn't any chance it's not
going to happen
we'll get to you know quarter million
deaths a year
and then the
and then the military and the people who
make money from selling military
equipment will say well we can take care
of that for a trillion dollars
and then we'll pay a trillion dollars
and they will go vaporize the cartels
do you think i'm wrong
there's no other way this can go
i don't see any force from anywhere
any variable they would change the
guaranteed direction that we will attack
mexico
guaranteed
now should we attack china because
they're sending us the
drugs now i don't know if you know how
china gets away with it
so president xi said yes we'll make you
know fentanyl
uh and the the precursors to fentanyl
will make them illegal
so
you know that that's good right we'll
make that illegal in china
but what they didn't do
is make all the variants illegal so the
fentanyl precursor people they just
change the formula a little bit it's
just as bad
but it's not technically the thing that
got banned
now let me ask you this
do you think china can't figure out how
to solve that problem
that their law is not including enough
stuff
can't figure that out right do you think
they care if their law doesn't doesn't
cover those things no they don't care if
they wanted to stop it
they would just go arrest the guy who's
in charge
they wouldn't care about which
you know which precursors are illegal or
legal
they would just go arrest the
 if they didn't want it to
keep happening
obviously
obviously the leadership wants it to
continue
it's too easy to stop
so obviously they want it
what should we do if china is sending
precursors essentially military
equipment to the cartels who are killing
americans well i don't think you want to
start a nuclear war i don't think you
want to invade
but we need to kill the dealers on the
ground
you can't tell me that we can't find
anybody in china that we could bribe to
go kill those fentanyl producers
we can't do a terrorist act in china
we can't set a bomb next to a factory in
china we don't have anybody in china who
has those you know that ability to blow
something up
we should be
those should be exploding
maybe it is i mean maybe somebody is but
we should definitely be attacking china
um
covertly to destroy the fentanyl
production
um would that trigger a world war uh
nuclear war
well
that's the risk that china's going to
have to take isn't it
if china wants to kill a quarter million
of us a year which is where it's going
to go to
then they need to risk nuclear war
they need to
right
so yes that is the risk that they should
be looking at very directly
um
all right
uh let's see we've got some more gas
lighting keeping going on here
i don't know if it's just me
but when i heard biden talking about
again
the insurrection that trump ran
here's what i hear
every time biden
the elected leader of the united states
uses the word insurrection
my mind imagines people who look a lot
like me going to jail for nothing
like i can't i can't unpair those two
things
every time he uses the word insurrection
i see him trying to put me in jail for
nothing
and
i think i made a turn today
because it's one thing for him to say
insurrection before the january 6
hearings have concluded
it's another thing to keep saying
insurrection when his own hearings well
i'll say it's his own
have shown that there was no
insurrection or planned insurrection or
actual insurrection
once it's been debunked
if he comes on television and says it
again he is targeting me
that's how i feel
and if my target if my president targets
me
a law-abiding voter who just has maybe
different opinions
if he's targeting me and that's what i
feel
then he's my enemy
he's not my president anymore
now it would be one thing if i were
breaking the law
yeah if your government targets you
because you broke the law well
you know that's that's on you
but he's targeting me for something
specifically that we know
i didn't break any laws
i mean he's putting me in the same boat
with anybody who who thought that the
january 6th thing was not so bad
the violence was bad but in terms of it
being an insurrection versus a protest
right
i'm taking this personally from now on
before the january 6 group debunked the
insurrection charge i was willing to let
that stand as well who knows
but now that it's debunked
this is personal
and this is biden against
citizens
it's against republicans basically and
this is the thing that democrats
continue to do
they're not targeting policy or
preferences they're targeting people
and this is a dark term yeah
so that whole dark thing
shark eyes
yeah
biden did have shark eyes
like i saw that too there's something
wrong with his eyes
but it does feel like the precursor to
haunting republicans
and so let me say this i don't feel
biden is even a president at this point
he's just a malign force
because i don't think he's capable of
doing the job who knows what's
you know what's behind it but
ah this is personal now so i i want the
republicans the democrats to know
that they they're walking up to a line
and they've already crossed the line of
making it personal
but let me let me say this as menacingly
as i possibly can
there's another line
and you're getting really close
to it
do you hear that
there's another line
there is another line you know what i'm
talking about
there's another line and you're getting
really close to it
and if i didn't warn you how
close you were to that line i would feel
that i was not doing my job you know as
a patriot
you're really close to the line
you better back up
back the up
it's okay if you make this just
political
political's okay
we're all used to that
you can lie that's political
but
when you start painting half of the
country
as insurrectionists
that's that's a line you need to back
the up off of okay
and and we need to be as clear of this
as clear about this as possible
uh lying's okay i mean we accept it it's
not okay but we accept it
politics is good words words are good
fighting hard
you know trying to game the system
that's all okay
but
you're getting really close to the line
and his last speech was dark and
chilling and directed as citizens in my
opinion
that's how i took it i took it directed
as citizens
you direct your as citizens
who are law abiding and we're trying to
do the right thing i'm positive
i think january 6 was people trying to
do the right thing
they didn't
but i think they tried
but i don't know how i can say this more
carefully
there is a line
back the off it
are you with me
is this just me
you see the line too right
don't pretend there's no line
there's a line
and back the off it and what i when
i say back the off it i mean with
the insurrection talk
you need to correct that mr joe biden
and mr mr democrats this isn't play
right
you're you've been in the political play
field and that's okay
a little bit of play hyperbole
you know even a little lie it's all part
of the political process that's good as
long as you're talking politics as long
as you're insulting you know politicians
you could even you know i don't even
mind if you make some
like general statements about
republicans or general statements about
democrats that's fine yeah yeah yeah all
the democrats are socialists yeah yeah
all the republicans or you know want to
want to control weapon whatever that's
fine that's all fine
but you have to know
there's a line
and if you don't see it
don't say you weren't warned
right
you make this personal
you better back the up
so that's all i'm saying somebody needed
to say it
um
all right that's about it
about it
all right
um yeah i don't even care about the
hypocrisy
right you know there's just a whole
bunch of stuff that's okay
just because historically we've we've
allowed that in politics yeah yeah the
hypocrisy the lying the hyperbole the
the dirty tricks the
you know the
the scheming the fake news that's okay
yeah we're used to that
but
just make sure you know where the line
is
all right
uh you want an insurrection i'll give
you an insurrection
yeah cnn headline right when cartoonist
calls for civil war
well i'm calling to avoid a civil war is
what i'm calling
and i'm saying that uh
you know that slippery slope thing i
keep talking about
where i'm usually debunking it but then
changing my mind halfway through
democrats can push
now let me ask you this
um
do you have the same
feeling i do that
it feels like
it feels like democrats are people who
complain about everything no matter how
small
and republicans are people who
are okay until they're not okay
but that could be just i'm reading my
own personality into some some things it
feels like that right and here would be
the blind spot
the blind spot would be if democrats
are looking at republicans and they're
not seeing
as much complaining as they would expect
because if because if the democrats were
in that position you'd see lots of
complaining
the lack of complaining
from the republicans
should not make you feel comfortable
right
you feel me right
the lack of complaining from republicans
about the way they're being treated
should not be taken as comfort
because
republicans are okay with things until
they're not
democrats are just mad all the time
about everything because the the way
they get resources but is by complaining
how do uh
how do men get resources in the
traditional let's say that the sexist
world
they go work right they get a job they
go work how do women get resources in
our sexist world again lots of
exceptions blah blah blah blah how do
women get resources
by making men feel bad
complaining
right sorry that's how it works
you know that
yeah don't give any trouble with this
because you know it's true you know it's
true
now if i said that's true of every woman
i'd be lying
and if i said that's true of every man
i'd be lying and if i said the world
were only men and women well
i think that that
that that also is too simplistic because
you've got lots of you know gender
ambiguity
yeah some people's you know wives are
the boss of the families plenty plenty
of exceptions
but when i say that the democrat party
is sort of the the woman party
complaining is their operating system
that if you complain enough you'll get
some stuff
the republicans are more like
if we have a good system
we'll all get better stuff
you see the difference
it's a complete based operating system
versus a let's say a system or machine
based
thing like if you make this machine work
we all get good stuff so let's work on
the machine
and the the democrats are more like
if i complain enough i can get some of
your stuff
so one of them is based on an abundance
mindset i'll go work i'll create a
system that makes more for everybody and
the other is based on a shortages
mindset
that
you've got some stuff i don't have some
stuff i need to get your stuff from you
and it goes to me
you know a transfer
now
is there a difference between men and
women
in hunting versus gathering
i'm way out of my depth here so i'm just
speculating
is it true that historically the men did
the hunting and the women did the
gathering
yeah the hunting is you go out and make
something happen
and the gathering is you
find things
you find it
you just find it
i think i think that the democrats being
sort of a
woman-dominated party are all about well
we don't have to make things
we just need to find them
and i found it it's in your pocket
hey i found some money it's over there
in elon musk's pocket
well problem solved
i need some money
there's some money in elon musk's pocket
so
let's put those together and problem
solved
right
there's very there's a very big
philosophical difference between hunting
and killing i'm sorry between hunting
and finding
very big and i feel like the the
republicans are hunters
and the democrats are finders
they're gatherers
now again
huge number of individual differences
i feel like i can only say that to
republicans and get away with it
i i could say well there's a general
thing going on here
but you all understand there's tons and
tons of individual exceptions and then
you and the republicans all go well
that's true
yeah yeah you're talking about a general
thing but of course there are plenty of
exceptions what do the democrats do when
you say that
you racist
i go no no no you you sexist
no no i'm saying there's plenty of
exceptions
and we we respect all the exceptions
equally
well you bigot
i'm really just talking about a general
theme here i'm not talking about any
individual
you
misogynist
so that's the way it works on the left
on the right you you can handle the fact
that individuals can be different than
the average
apparently that's a concept that's not
universally understood
somebody says that as a very funny
female joke that's extremely sexist and
you can't say it
well why did you announce it
don't announce a joke you're not going
to tell us
let me introduce you to the uh
the humor rule
the humor rule goes like this
you can't tell me there's a joke you
can't tell me
you can either not mention it or you can
tell me the joke
those are the rules i didn't make them
up
i did not make them up
but uh i would not encourage you to say
that joke on youtube
[Laughter]
if this were the locals platform they
could tell that joke do you know why
because people on the locals platform
would know it's a joke
that's the difference
and they say okay that's insulting but
it's pretty funny
right on the locals people insult me all
the time but if it's funny
that's fine
it's funny
all right
um
you're saying gathering and hunting or
both harvesting
yeah i feel a difference
i see what you're saying you're using a
word to change the argument
don't use words to change my argument
you know what i'm talking about
all right
uh i haven't seen any big california
fires somebody was asking me
it's possible that california has
figured out how to stop the big fires
because they now have that emergency
helicopter brigade that gets on stuff
quickly and works at night now they can
operate at night as well
is y70 on fire
okay well it's not not nearly as bad as
it used to be our air quality is
actually good where i am
all right well i hope they get that u70
fire under control
all right
um
all right i'll catch up on the u70 fire
i haven't seen anything about that yet
yeah we get smoke from the yosemite fire
as we really
all right
so i guess i didn't know about the
yosemite fire i'll take a look at that
there's an oakland fire
did california clear the underbrush you
know i didn't hear anything about that
um
but i also don't know is there any use
for underbrush
is there any way you can monetize
underbrush
can you collect enough of it to turn it
into anything can you turn it into some
biofuel you can do a biomass thing right
mulch
fertilizer
does it work as fertilizer
underbrush makes the soil of the forest
yeah
well
yeah i guess they do need soil but do
they always need more if you have enough
for a tree
um
oh the oak fires out
all right
what about zielinski
all right i think that's all we've got
for today and i believe that we've done
our job
uh is this the best live stream you've
ever seen
am i mistaken or
or does it look exactly like it is it is
it is
now let me ask you something
um
so good it hurts
let me ask you something
do you think we make a difference
like collectively
so i would have you know no impact on
anything if i didn't have an audience
so the audience basically you know
imbues me with whatever energy i have
um i think we do i think we do
because i think we're we're approaching
the point
where if if you and i collectively all
of you plural
if you and i collectively thought
something was a terrible terrible idea
i feel like it would be harder for a
government to do it just because
you know our opinions do have enough of
a
reach
that it would be embarrassing to do
something that was just a bad idea and
it had been
clearly described as a bad idea
so clarity is one of the things i feel
like we can add to the system what do
you think
maybe that's the only thing maybe the
only thing i add to the system is
clarity and context
because that's all i'm trying to do
i'm trying to only add clarity in
context if i add clarity and context
you should come to the same conclusion
as me
so i'm not trying to necessarily change
your mind
with argument i'm trying to make sure
that you see the same things i see
and once you see them i'm confident that
you will end up with the same opinion so
i don't need to directly change your
opinion i'll just change what things
you've been exposed to and it should be
the same thing
should be
not every time but it should be in the
long run
um
[Music]
scott would you do your own show on fox
if offered
no
no i wouldn't
um
so the trouble is as soon as you get a
boss
you're useless
you all get that right the moment i have
a boss
i'm worthless
because that is just the boss the only
thing you know you're hearing is what
the boss allowed me to say
do you think there's anything i said
today that a boss would have let me say
just think about today's show
think about the live stream you just
watched how much of that do you think i
could have put on a network show or even
a cable show almost none of it's right
and i certainly couldn't do the
the level of emotion
i would have a
set time limit
and i guarantee you that i would have
conversations about offending my
sponsors
well first of all who would sponsor this
i would probably already have sponsor
offers you know even with this size of
an audience i would already have sponsor
offers if this were not absolute poison
to sponsors
so one of the things that i can offer
you
is that i will continue to be poisoned
to sponsors
i'm not trying to do that but apparently
if you're honest you can't get sponsored
because the sponsors need you to be
you know just generic and family
friendly and you know stay stay on the
political
right side of things
so
i'm not trying to do that
ed products
all right um yeah it's hard to speculate
under a major brand you're right so i do
a lot of stuff that's pure speculation
and i label it
i don't have a date yet for the russell
brand conversation
um yeah if i if i had sponsors they
would influence me i think they would
so as you know i
do a comic strip for newspapers
do you think that i can do in the
newspaper in online i mean probably more
people see it online
but do you think i could do i could do a
dilbert comic that's exactly the comic i
would want to write
and that the
people who are my clients would be okay
with that the answer is no
no they would not be okay with my honest
opinions on stuff they need they need
something that is family friendly
so you may notice i'm i'm pushing the
boundaries in the past several months
um i'm i'm kind of making all of my
editors and my clients uncomfortable
with the content
because i'm going after some of the woke
stuff etc you know some of the pandemic
stuff and
there are papers that are not running me
so that my comic about you know
the character dave i think there were
some newspapers that didn't run it
because it was too dangerous for him
so i do keep my content within the realm
that i know the clients will allow even
though i'm pushing the edge which by the
way that's what they pay for
you know if your client buys you as a
cartoonist especially my kind of cartoon
they're they're paying you to push the
boundary
but not too much right they need you to
be a little bit edgy that's part of the
that's part of the entertainment
so you're gonna see dilbert getting
a lot edgier in the coming year
i suppose i'm breaking news now in a
small way so so dilbert is going to
get cancelled
um let's say by design
because as i'm approaching my retirement
planning years
i don't want to go out
with a whimper
i don't
i want to go out in flames
and if i have to set something on flame
that needs to be set on flame and by the
way productively i'm not talking about
anarchy i'm talking about setting on
fire something that maybe needed to be
set on fire
but yeah
dilbert is going to get edgier and
edgier until they won't let me do it
anymore
so that's my that will be my version of
retiring and then you know what i'm
going to do
i guess i'm breaking the news here for
the first time
so this is a
preliminary plan but it's an actual plan
i'm going to be
cancelled by everybody in the regular
client business
and then i'll move my content to a
subscription service
called locals
so there is a good chance that say five
years from now
that the only place you would ever see a
dilbert comic is on a subscription
service
but then
i can say anything i want
and you haven't seen that yet
you've you haven't seen that yet
so but i'm not going to do that unless i
get cancelled and i'm going to try as
hard as i can
to fly as close to the sun as i can and
by the way
i never do anything just to offend
some people think i might
but i'd never do content that's meant
for entertainment or maybe to provoke
but i don't do it just to piss people
off
there's a reason for it
all right that's all for now
and
i'm gonna go do something else and so
are you i'll talk to you later
