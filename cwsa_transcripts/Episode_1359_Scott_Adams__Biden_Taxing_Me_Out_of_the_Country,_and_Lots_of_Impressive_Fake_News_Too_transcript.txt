hello
everybody come on in come on in it's
time
time for coffee with scott adams the
best part of the day every single time
oh yeah we'll talk about all the stuff
all the real news all the fake news
and uh but first if you'd like to enjoy
it
at a 10 and a 10 why would you settle
for less
really no reason all you need is a
copper margarita glass of tanker gel
stain the canteen joke a plastic vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day i
think that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
yeah i made you made you rush didn't i
you're like where's my cup where's my
mug
where's my vessel well now you got it
get ready
for the best thing that's gonna happen
today all over the world this
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
you know i don't even remember how this
started
but i'm glad we're doing it all right
let's talk about all the things number
one uh
big congratulations to greg goffeld
his uh his new show so in addition to
being on the five
on fox news he has his now evening show
the 11 p.m on the
on the east coast it's 8 pm on the west
coast and apparently he's just
destroying the competition he just wiped
out
all competition at that uh that time
so congratulations to greg gutfeld for
just
obliterating the competition quite
impressive
i think everybody knew that was going to
happen as soon as i heard the as soon as
i heard he was going to have a show in
that time
spot i thought to myself oh this is
going to be fun
and sure enough it is the show is really
good by the way
you should watch it joy reid
was reporting that when she went for a
run yesterday i guess
she wore two masks in addition to being
fully vaccinated and running outdoors
so pretty safe pretty safe two masks and
fully vaccinated
have you noticed there's a weird
evolution happening with joy
reid and it's happening in her hairstyle
and i'm trying to figure out if this is
the simulation
tapping me on the shoulder have you seen
she's gone to this hairstyle where
there's there's like a big
puff over here of hair and then there's
another big
puff over here but sort of parted in the
middle
and she's becoming a little bit more
like the pointy-eared boss
in dilbert every day and i swear to god
it's all i can see when i look at her
you know because she used to have a
completely different hairstyle it wasn't
wasn't close to that
but it just keeps moving a little bit
closer to the pointy-haired boss
and i asked myself is this a case of
code reuse
because the pointy-haired boss would
wear two masks
and go jogging after full being fully
vaccinated
so parody and reality have now merged as
i said
there are only three days left to bid
on the dilbert nft it's the only dilbert
comic strip that uses the f-word
uh it was never published of course but
if you would like to
to own the only dilbert comic ever
that has the f word in it there's also
the clean version if you wanted that one
uh just uh you could google dilber nft
or just go to my twitter feed and you'll
you'll see the link to it in the profile
but it's up to twelve thousand dollars
now somebody's bid twelve thousand
dollars for that
i think most of the bidding will happen
the last day
so you don't wanna get to the last day
and then find out it's over
apparently biden has agreed to help
india with vaccines and sending them
equipment to help make their own
vaccines
and stuff and i have to say this is a
good move
you know as much as i'm all about
america
first meaning that i think every country
needs to take care of itself first
has nothing to do with america per se
but it's just a better model
if countries take care of themselves
first however
if you have something big such as a
disaster
a world war that sort of thing you know
it makes more sense to help help each
other out
but i would note that the way you make
allies in this world
is doing this stuff you don't really
make
allies by talking right you make
allies by the marshall plan
by defending another country in a war
that's how you make an ally
nothing is really going to happen
between the united states and france
right we could fight all day long but
it's still going to be a sibling rivalry
because we have a history that is just
such a
a solid story of france and the united
states being
you know allied at the right times
that's what makes allies
you know same with same with other
countries
but this was what an opportunity in
which india is in
really dire straits the united states
could help
at at some expense to people in the
united states
meaning that if we help them with
vaccines it might be
a little less for us although i think
we're getting closer to what they call
the wall
where there will be more vaccines than
there are people willing to take it
fairly quickly so maybe we're not
putting out ourselves out too much
but i am very much in favor of making
india the strongest ally we can make
them
because china is the big threat in the
future and the united states plus india
is kind of necessary it's just necessary
and if this is one of the things that
makes us closer it makes us more
reliable allies in the future good move
so i'm going to say a good move for the
joe biden administration
i'm not going to criticize them for
everything just
by reflex let's talk about all the fake
stories and probable fake stories are
you ready
so here are all the things that are in
the news or on social media
that i think are fake or have been shown
to be fake
there's a story on social media that uh
controversial right-wing figure
nick fuentes is on a no-fly list
and the story if you can call this story
is that there doesn't seem to be a
specific trigger for that
meaning it looks like on the surface
it looks like he got put on a knife no
fly zone
for saying um controversial things
do you believe that do you believe that
the
first of all that is true that he's on a
no-fly zone he did have some video
of him being rejected for a flight
actually in audio
um so we know he got i i think we are
confident he got rejected for a flight
on southwest but do you think there's no
other reason
and that the story is that's the whole
story there's no other reason
than the things he said uh
in in public i don't believe it
now i'm not saying there's a good reason
for him to be on a no-fly list
in fact i'd be really surprised if
there's a good reason for that
no matter what he said and let me be
clear i'm not defending anything he's
done or said
he's he's beyond my you know
my safety zone of somebody i can say
good things about
it's just not safe and i don't have a
reason to support him
so he can do what he's doing uh you know
i don't criticize people for freedom of
speech
even if it's offensive but it's not for
me to defend him
i'm just saying i don't believe the
story i don't believe the story that
there's no reason
or that it happened one of those is not
true
but certainly not the way it's being
presented um
and i'm not saying that nick fuentes is
saying anything that's untrue
i think he might actually not know
what's going
he on looks like he actually doesn't
know why it's happening
so i think he's not lying i just think
there's more of the story
um you know the story about john kerry
allegedly telling iran's
foreign minister about 200 israeli
strikes on syrian
targets of iranian assets
and john kerry has said
unequivocally that never happened
but it also doesn't matter if it
happened
because it's also been reported that it
was in the news
before sharif heard about it
so it was just a news story so if john
kerry did say this and he says
unequivocally he did not that it just
never happened
even if it did happen it still isn't the
story
because it was already in the news
before it would have happened if it
happened
and probably didn't uh did you hear the
story about every
new illegal immigrant would be given a
copy of kamala harris's book
well apparently that's just fake news
somebody took a picture of
one book that may or may not have been
in the
possession of one immigrant one time
that's it that's it there's there's no
truth to it whatsoever
this was like a whole news cycle
yesterday now
do you see the pattern yet do you
remember i told you
that this pattern you could expect that
there's going to be fake news everywhere
but the party that's
out of power will have the most fake
news that happens to be fox news at the
moment
because their president is not in office
so
you're going to see a lot of fake news
coming out of fox news
there won't be less of it from cnn
probably but you will see a difference
in the
in the balance i think uh so the kamala
harris book thing was never true
a whole new cycle on that uh then there
was a story about
a private school that's barring
vaccinated teachers
so this is in the news today there's a
private school that's saying they won't
hire you if you got a vaccination
is that true really
do you think that's true again you don't
have to look into the details
do you really do you think that's true
you think there's a real private school
that really said you can't work here if
you're vaccinated
well maybe but i think you should assume
it's not true
it has every hallmark of a not true
story if that's true
i'm gonna be pretty surprised now i
don't doubt
maybe somebody once speculated about it
or
maybe somebody said it who's associated
with the school or
maybe they've been noodled about it but
do you think that will be the actual
policy going forward
no no um so i would i would count on
that one to turn into fake news if it's
not already
um and then of course there are lots of
uh videos of police
shooting innocent people when in fact
it doesn't look so innocent to us so
most of the news
if you went by volume not in terms of
importance of stories
but just in numbers most of them are not
true
most of the news left and right
just not true and the stuff that they
try to make true
is uh the the things they try to make
true
they don't really understand well enough
to get the story right you know the
science stuff
especially um there's another story here
that kamala harris uh is
was discussing giving mexicans a pathway
to u.s citizenship
in exchange for planting trees in mexico
so that's that's today's outrageous
story does that sound true
do you think this is true that kabul
harris
is discussing giving mexicans a pathway
to u.s citizenship in exchange
for planting trees in mexico
i doubt it i mean you know there's a
reason given the reason given that these
trees would
you know create industries and stuff in
mexico maybe help with global warming
who knows
so it would be sort of a good thing ish
but do you believe this story i'm going
to say no on this one
now again i'm going to be wrong on some
of these
you know you should be prepared that i'm
going to call fake news on
something that ends up true
but i'm feeling pretty confident this
one's not true
just look at the news you got today it's
just one fake
story after another um
and here's a glenn greenwald he was on
uh
one of the shows yesterday i guess and
he was talking about a media trick for
making
real news disappear and this is what he
said about
hunter biden's laptop so glenn greenwald
said quote everyone knows
now that the hunter biden documents
including those raising questions about
joe's participation
in his china deals are authentic but
admitting that
is a scandal given uh what they in
facebook did
so they're treated so they've trained
liberals
to think any mention of it is trivial
so there are two ways that you can make
a story go away
one is to just not mention it
two is to come up with a fake story
narrative that sort of cancels it out
but this third way is diabolical which
is they do mention it
but they brush it aside as unimportant
that's really good technique because if
they didn't mention it
you'd wonder why especially if you heard
it from some other source
but if they and if they do mention it
and try to explain it away
then you've got something to argue with
right and then it becomes a debate well
can you really explain it away or is it
real but if you simply mention it
and then treat it like it's not
important what does your audience think
the audience doesn't know what's
important have you ever heard the
uh the story a uh what's the phrase
not paper of record but new the
newsmaker
sites so within the news industry it's a
well-known phenomenon
that although you know there might be a
hundred stories
that could be the big story on any day
you know a hundred candidates for
what you should care about there are
only a few news outlets who decide
one of those hundred big things
happening are the three that you're
going to hear about
and they decide okay these three are the
ones we'll talk about
now if your local newspaper which is you
know gutted of all reporters and
everything
if your your local newspaper decided oh
we'll pick this story and talk about it
nobody would care just nobody would care
but if the new york times says okay
there are 100 stories we're going to
pick this one
then the other outlets pick it up as
well because the new york times
effectively turns it into news
by saying there are a lot of things
happening but this one is news and then
the others say oh
new york times says it's news we better
get on this that's how everything works
somebody big has to say it's news and
then everybody cares about it
if the news industry decides to treat
something that you would think would be
big news as just another thing that's in
the 100 things that happened
you will go away thinking it wasn't
important because if it were important
it would be bigger news we're so trained
that nothing can be important unless the
news says it's important
that you won't be able to get your brain
there your brain will not be able to
process that laptop as important
because the news just tells you it isn't
by by the way they treat it
so that's really good technique um
propaganda wise and brainwashing wise
and again if you're not following glenn
greenwald
you're missing the best show on earth
right now
no exaggeration within the political
let's say media realm
the best show on earth is everything
glenn greenwald says this month
i don't know how long it'll last but for
the last month
he's by far the most interesting
media personality pulling back the cover
on the
cia democrat media link
by the way you know about this right let
me let me test you
in the comments i expect more people
associated with the right to know this
but
you do know that our cia does work with
democrats
and the two of them work with the the
news
to craft a narrative which is good for
the cia
good for the democrats and good for the
news
not necessarily for you but that's not
the point of it
how many just watching the comments how
many of you knew that
um i'm going to read the comments just
in case you're listening
so they're going by says yep yep what's
the source
somebody says yes obviously true true
yes yep
so depressing somebody says no no
mockingbird that's that was the name of
it in the past
absolutely yes yes obviously yep yep yep
what's the source
somebody says um i would i would point
you to
glenn greenwald's writing on this for
your source information
what we we do we do have sources
so so let me say that the sources are
documented and confirmed there's no
question about it
that i'm aware of you know taking
take into account the context here i
just told you the stories that even
are still reported as true are probably
untrue
so my my skepticism you know needle
is sort of always pinned to maximum
which is not good enough by the way
maximum skepticism still isn't good
enough
to to protect you from all the fake news
but i
generally started thinking anything that
sounds crazy is crazy
so you should know that about me right
that if it
sounds crazy it almost always is it's
just not real
what could sound crazier than the cia
democrats and the news cnn being an
example
what could be crazier than them working
together
to form a narrative that bamboozles the
country
it's pretty crazy right i wouldn't say
it unless the sources were
were dead obvious so i'm not the one who
reports on this but
just just look into uh glenn greenwald
look at what i tweeted from his
his uh his uh
just from yesterday so if you look at
his
twitter feed you'll you'll see
everything you need
here's a an alarming trend
if i turn on fox news or if i uh watch
some
conservative twitter feed
there's a really good chance i'm going
to see a viral video of
black people fighting savagely
like way too much right every time i
look at
right-leaning media it just happens to
be
a viral video of all black people
fighting each other
or a black person stomping
an asian man to death but you go over to
cnn it's all about the
white cops killing black people who did
nothing
and were just stopped for a traffic
infraction or something or a minor thing
you know it's getting really grotesque
because neither of these images are even
close to truth
it is not true that black people are
breaking into spontaneous riots and
fights
in airports and in diners around the
world
we do have it on video but i gotta think
it's not
breaking out all over the world but it
feels like that if you watch enough
videos
likewise i don't think white cops are
slaying
black people in their cars just because
they look the you know a little
sketchy or something i don't think
either of these is an
accurate picture but video is so
powerful
that you've got these two narratives
fighting each other and they're both
they're both grotesque
they're both grotesque now i do i do
think that you have to show the news and
if these viral videos exist
of course we're going to see them but
when you see the
you know the the focus of the the left
versus the focus of the right
it's really grotesque they're they're
both just grotesque images
of america uh joe rogan's getting some
heat
for being smart
that's i could just end there i could
just end without saying anything else
joe rogan is getting in trouble with the
media for just being a smart person
i guess i'll give you the details but
that's pretty much the story
all right here's the details
cnn uh gives this headline or at least
the chiron
says that joe rogan wades into anti-vaxx
narrative
all right so that's the chiron the joe
rogan
wades into anti-vaxx narrative
now does that seem fair do you think
that the story
will support that summary
do you think when i tell you the details
you're going to say oh my god
that's true joe rogan just waded into
anti-vaxx territory
do you think that's true of course not
of course not it's nuanced it's smart
what joe rogan said i'll tell you in a
moment and the the news just can't
handle that
they can't handle a little bit
of smartness
and an opinion it just it doesn't fly
here's what he did say
and i'll try to i'll try to characterize
it as best i can i hope i don't get any
of it wrong
but basically the question was very
narrow so he
joe rogan did say he thinks the
vaccinations are
probably you know a good idea right
start there
so does this make sense that joe rogan
has waded into
anti-vax narrative but the topic
the very story they're talking about he
starts by saying he thinks the
vaccinations are probably a good idea in
general
just generally speaking is that how you
would have characterized his opinion
you would have said he waded into
anti-vax narrative
because he did make one exception he
said if a 21 year old asked him
if if this 21 year old should get a
vaccination
that he might suggest no if that person
is young and healthy and exercises and
eats right and
he has a good health lifestyle now let
me ask you this
is that anything but a reasoned cost
benefit analysis
of the unknown risks of vaccination
versus the tiny tiny tiny risk that the
21 year old will actually
um be infected and die
because correct me if i'm wrong the
reason that a 21 year old would get
vaccinated
is not necessarily to protect them but
to protect other people right
am i right the point of the 21 year old
is not to protect them
the point is to protect them from maybe
infecting other people
while they they recover fine but the
other person doesn't
so if you're giving advice to the 21
year old
isn't it fair to say let me tell you
what's good for you specifically
right because the question was not
joe rogan can you tell us what would be
the best way to get to herd immunity
through vaccinations the question was
what would you tell one person
in one specific situation who was
healthy and had no
real risk that
was nothing but a cost-benefit analysis
where this very specific case it's hard
to know that you're getting enough
benefit
individually is there a benefit to the
the larger hole maybe a little it
doesn't look like a lot
so here's how i would have reported this
if i were cnn
joe rogan talks about the cost benefit
of a special case or joe rogan talks
about
whether it's good for the 21 year old
versus good for society
or joe rogan has a smart opinion
about how you should parse your risk
did any of those headlines say anything
that was untrue
all of these all of these summaries are
true including
you could argue cnn's is true-ish
is just super misleading because now
they've taken joe rogan and thrown them
into a whole category of anti-vax people
and i don't know where he stands on
vaccinations for other things
but that's a pretty gross way to to
treat somebody who just said something
unambiguously smart
and just treat him like he's a
idiot
this is amazing all right
joe biden's going to unveil his
big plan i guess he's doing his state of
the state of the union or just an
address tomorrow
whatever it is i think it's the state of
the union and um
it's going to be super expensive and
he's going to raise taxes on people like
me
and uh but he's got a lot of benefits in
here so let's say he's got
he wants to pay for four years of free
public education for
every child in a year universal high
quality preschool
and two years of free community college
i don't really understand this
because four years of free public
education
is less than what people get now
don't people already get an entire
an entire uh childhood free education
so i'm just i just copied this language
from one of the stories
i don't even know what that means at
least four years of free public
education
is way less than we already have so
either the news report is just stupid
and uh all right so he's gonna massively
increase
uh education now here's the good part
the good part is that he explicitly says
we need this to compete with china
so i like that i like the fact
that when the biden administration is
sort of figuring out how to explain what
they want to do
that they at least put part of their
filter
how do you protect in the long run
against chinese dominance
and education certainly would be one of
the ways to do that
so i like that part of his argument even
though i'm not sure that's
you know obviously that's not the whole
reason you do it
but who pays for all this stuff we'd all
like everybody to have a free education
if it were free but people like me are
going to be paying for it how much am i
going to pay
well being uh in the top tier of
people paying taxes uh my tax rates
when you add in the california tax rate
of 12.3
and the federal of 39.6 and most of the
ways that you can
avoid taxes will be taken away my total
will be about 52
tax rates so just my income tax will be
about 52
then on top of that as i consume things
i'll pay sales tax
as i pay myself and my corporation i'll
pay payroll taxes
and of course i'm in california so i'll
pay property taxes
so my effective tax rate
will be i don't know
60 percent 65 something like that
maybe 65 tax rate
and um also my capital gains
would go to 43 basically doubling
so this this basically takes uh most of
the wealth i've accumulated in my life
which happens to be in the stock market
uh because from the beginning of my
career i
took any extra money i had just put it
into an index fund
so now my my net wealth has grown to you
know let's say this amount
and joe biden since the only way i could
use that money
would be to you know sell the stock turn
it into money and then spend it
but now he's going to take a gigantic
chunk of that so my net wealth would
shrink by i don't know 25 or something
somebody says stop whining scott give it
up
well here's let me let me make a
balanced case for this
in the world of economics the worst
thing you can do is change the rules
once people have adapted to the rules
when i was born into this country and
raised and educated there were a certain
set of rules
which said that if you worked really
hard you could make a certain amount of
money and you would keep
most of it now the rules have changed
hey you worked hard all your life you
did everything that the country told you
to do
uh surprise you don't get to keep most
of it now
you get to keep a small part of what you
earned
and not only that but the money you've
already earned
in the stock market is just sitting
there i thought it was my money
we're going to take it from you we're
going to take about a quarter of it
now i also had planned
to give away as much money as i could
while i'm alive
and have done a good job of that so much
so that i really wouldn't feel
comfortable
retiring at the moment because i've
given away so much money
that i kind of have to work to make sure
that i can retire in the
style in which i'd want to now
would i have given away as much money as
i have in my lifetime
if i knew that when i got to retirement
age
a quarter of it would be taken away that
i didn't expect
no no i wouldn't have i would have done
things much differently
what if the biden tax idea is getting
get put into play and my taxes are
raised how will i
respond well i will respond like a
victim
i won't respond like an american i won't
respond like a team player
i won't respond like a patriot i will
respond like someone who just got
 because i i led my entire life
based on a set of rules that you just
 changed now am i still rich
yeah am i still better off than just
about everybody
yeah would that make me happy
nope nope what do democrats get wrong
every time what democrats get wrong
every time
is human motivation what is my human
motivation
if my tax rate collectively is less than
half of what i make well i don't like
paying taxes
but if the government is taking less
than half
i say to myself ah okay you know it's
part of the cost of being a rich person
in the country
but as soon as the government takes more
than half and then
a lot more than half i don't feel the
same
and so my human motivation just clicked
and it happened this morning in real
time i can wat you can watch it happen
with me right now
you haven't heard me complain about
taxes too much have you
not really and i don't really have much
standing to
because if you're rich nobody cares
right
literally nobody cares nor should they
yeah i'm not asking for sympathy in any
in any sense whatsoever
i'm simply telling you that human
motivation is part of everything
my human motivation just got triggered
and i'm going to do everything i can
to deny the united states as much money
as i can
legally right i'm not going to break any
laws i don't take those kinds of chances
but i'm going to dedicate a huge part of
my
full effort away from productivity
toward keeping the united states from
stealing my money
that you told me i could keep if i did
everything you said
let me talk to you now united states you
told me i could keep my money
if i stayed out of trouble worked hard
went to school did everything right
now you're changing it you i'm
gonna keep
as much of my money as i can and by the
way i
i had instructions with my accountants
for my entire career
that we don't do anything that's even
exotic
even if it's legal right of course i
would only do legal things
but i don't do any exotic tax things
with tax shelters
i don't have a house in the virgin
islands to avoid taxes
i don't do any of that and i
intentionally don't do that
because i think paying my fair share of
taxes is actually
not a bad thing but once it gets over
half
half of the money i make more than a
half
there's just something in my head that
just clicks and you're watching it in
real time it's happening right now
i am going to make sure this country
gets as
little of my money as i can
because you changed the rules
and you screwed me it's personal right
it's just personal so good luck
good luck getting half of my money now
because i i have to
also have to think about retiring
because if i continue working i'm
getting so little for the amount that i
work it just
maybe isn't worth it i should just
retire
lower my maybe i can lower my tax rate i
don't know if that would work or not
and and just live out my rest my days
creating absolutely nothing
because you know what
i worked for myself as much as for the
country
and now i'm just i'm not interested you
i've lost interest in funding the
country
because you didn't play it right you
didn't you didn't treat me right
joe biden if you get away with this and
so i am calling upon the
republicans to squash this if they can
now the problem of course is that we're
going to run up an amazing debt
and who's going to pay for it me
right so if i stay in this country it
seems that
this is the trend that whatever money
i've made over my lifetime will be
taken from me in increasing amounts
and now i just i literally have to look
for another country
now when i say that i mean that actually
i mean i'm literally gonna have to spend
some time
looking into other countries to figure
out the tax
situation and what do you do with
citizenship
and how do i talk christine into moving
to another country
but i didn't want to do any of this i
wanted to just pay my 49
tax rate go to work do what's good for
the country
and you just knocked me right off of
that plan i am off of that plan now
so you joe biden and all of your
 thieves
for putting me in this situation and i
know
i i know i don't get any sympathy nor do
i ask for it
all right um and the corporate tax rates
going up
blah blah blah blah so joe biden
on the positive side does have a made in
america director
so there's a woman celeste
drake who's going to make sure that
more stuff is made in america i guess i
don't know exactly what that entails
what exactly does the
made in america director do is it just
talking to people because i don't think
there are any laws are there
caleb jones about moving out of america
oh there's a
youtube about how to move out of america
you know the the only reason to stay in
america is for the military protection
and the natural disaster protection
because i don't think anybody does
better than america
in in when when there's trouble
so i would feel safest in america but
you could also live possibly somewhere
where you're protected by an american
uh an american like let's say defense
umbrella
but you don't have to pay taxes so i
just go somewhere where america would
protect that country
but i don't have to pay taxes for it i
just get it for free
all right um ronan farron
ronan farron ronan pharaoh
is talking about there's a story about
new york attorney general
attorney general erica schneiderman
apparently ronan reported in 2018
that eric schneiderman had assaulted
several women
and today he admitted to slapping
another unwanted contact
and will have his law license suspended
blah blah blah
what what kind of story is this
how often was the attorney general
slapping women
apparently it was like some kind of a
weird like how many
how many people have you ever slept have
you ever slapped anybody
i mean outside of just good clean fun
and i don't even know what to think
about this apparently he has
a drinking problem i think that might be
part of it or something
but seriously how many women have you
ever slapped
yeah i think zero is the right number
right
at least outside of the bedroom
um let me tell you something that
will this get me kicked off of social
media
i don't know want to take a chance
let's take a chance see if i get kicked
off of social media
um i l i save the controversial stuff
sometimes for the the end
because the people who don't really care
have already signed off
and i'm going to tell you a story
you ready and the story has a context
i believe that one of the biggest things
that women
don't know in the united states anyway
the biggest thing that women don't know
is how other women act
when there's no woman watching
all right when the woman is alone with a
man
just completely alone private situation
i don't believe that women act in that
situation
in any way similar to the way other
women
think they act in that situation
and i believe that men have this unique
view
into women that even women don't know
about
because women know about themselves but
doesn't everybody think they're a freak
i've never met anybody who didn't think
that personally they were a freak
so if a woman acts a certain way but
only in front of
one man at a time and nobody else
watching nobody else knows about that
the man does in fact men
know and watching the comments because
i'm seeing people
lol you know what i'm talking about
right
this i'm seeing all the lols going by
and i don't i can't tell if those are
men or women saying that
but trust me women
trust me women you've never met women
all of you women who think you know your
girlfriends
you know your sister nope
no you don't there's a whole other side
of women
that i'm pretty sure only a man gets to
see you when they're alone and that's it
well let me tell you this one story to
demonstrate it
and i want to couch this very carefully
there's nothing i'm going to say that
would
promote the activity i'm going to
explain all right so this is just the
story
i'm not recommending it promoting it or
endorsing it
all right just a story it's a real thing
that happened
years ago i was working in a corporate
office in the big bank and there was a
secretary
back when there were secretaries and the
secretary came to work uh
obviously beaten up had a black eye you
know obviously
had been in some kind of a bad
altercation
well of course the people in the office
were concerned especially the
the other women who worked with her and
they finally got her to open up
and she told them that it was her
boyfriend and
her boyfriend had beaten her savagely
and
wasn't the first time apparently it was
a
a regular event uh that he would just
beat her up and i'm talking about black
eye type of beating up you know serious
stuff
well uh we collectively the people who
worked with her were very concerned and
uh you know worked with her as much as
we could and it got her
finally to break up with the boyfriend
finally so she broke up with the
boyfriend
good news well little time goes by she's
signal
i'm single we start hanging out
things progress as things do for single
people
we end up back at her place
things start happening she says
hit me i say what
she says hit me i go what do you mean
hit you
you mean like slap you she goes no
hit me with your fist i said you're
kidding right
she goes no hit me punch me
and i said you don't mean that you don't
mean like
punch you as hard as i can like a a man
punches somebody to fight
do you she said yes
yes hurt me
like basically beat me up
now of course i did not
yeah of course i did not but
ladies did she tell you that story
is that the story you heard because it
wasn't the story anybody else in the
office hurt
not one of her girlfriends who knew her
really well
ever heard that story did they
now men
men in the comments this is where it's
going to get dangerous
how many times you've been in that
situation now not necessarily a punch
but how many times you've been in a
situation where the woman asked
repeatedly and specifically to be rough
just looking at your comments
somebody says once uh yep
uh was she blonde i don't know why
you're asking that
i've been seeing never so i've seen once
i'm seeing
yes no me never not me
at least twice never yep at least one
time
did yep zero nope yes
never nope uh five or six times
uh choking yes girl said you better
bruise me
wanted bruises uh
i have had the request a few times
people are saying
considered a free pass okay that's
uh slapping yes no no
no just choking and spanking run
a lot of spanking right
okay so there you have it
um i don't know what the percentages
were but you saw that there were
a healthy dollop of people who have had
some kind of similar
experience now let me say again i'm not
recommending it i'm not endorsing it
nothing like that i'm just saying
there's this whole world
that's invisible to women
you know the individual woman always
knows what they're doing but
women don't know what those individuals
are doing when they're behind closed
doors and it's
probably not what you think um
somebody says boy i must really travel
in different circles
well i do think there's a personality
filter
that happens here there is a certain
type of guy
that a woman is not going to ask to do
that
would you agree you know if if you have
i don't want to get into you know beta
and alpha but just
for the point of the conversation
i do think that there's a certain
segment of the population that no woman
is going to ask
to do that and there's another type of
guy
that probably they're they're in the
room because they think he might do that
i mean so so i would say that
it makes perfect sense that if your
entire
uh personality screams i would never get
into that
nobody's ever gonna bring it up but if
there's something about you that looks a
little dangerous
you're probably gonna hear it that would
be my guess
all right um yeah somebody's saying that
shades of
gray that book sold a lot of copies so
clearly there's
something out there but stay safe don't
hit anybody
that would be my advice to you tomorrow
cnn will
run the headline uh gilbert cartoonists
well you know how that's going to go
right
[Laughter]
all right there's a terrible comment in
the comments here
uh but i'm not gonna read it
all right that's all i got for now um
god i hope i hope joe biden's address
gives us some red meat
other than making me want to leave the
country uh
i really really hope it does all right
that's all for now i'll talk to you
later
