well we're preparing for the show of
shows
today you're going to be so happy with
it seriously you'll be
delighted
uhoh problem printer just
died
uhoh uh that's a
problem let's try
again oh
no computer number one
down computer number
two will it be capable
let's see if I put my notes on the cloud
where they
belong come on baby oh come
on sink
sink all right that one's not
sinking this one's not working ah looks
like we have no no show notes
today
huh might have to wing it
today the the computer with my show
notes just crashed and it doesn't look
like it's coming
back all right
H all right we're totally brick
here remind me what is the command for
quitting an
application never mind I'll Google it
every single time I my computer crashes
I have to look up that
command and I know you're telling me
what it is how
to stop app on
Mac and I Google it every time how to
force
quit
uh keyboard
shortcut no that's not
it God damn it
we got quite a problem here
today will there be a show I don't
know without notes is very likely very
unlikely all right
computer stop
processing oh may have healed
itself we might have good luck after
all it could could even reboot
it without doing a hard reboot it was
locked up it couldn't even get to the
reboot
commands it seems to be
working I don't know how you decide when
to upgrade your
computer but I have a uh I have a
technique which
is remember when uh Apple was accused of
slowing down its phones to make you buy
a new one do you remember that and we
all thought we were going crazy it's
like it feels like it's slowing down
that can't be right and then it turned
out it was true well there's something
like that that happens with the computer
and I'm in that mode
now so what happens is almost every time
I use my main Mac Macintosh computer
Apple it gives me an unusual error that
I haven't seen before it's always added
some kind of space it's add a scratch
space or it's that a disc space and no
matter how much you delete doesn't make
any difference and this will be like the
fifth computer in a row I had to just
replace because it would keep pretending
it was out of space now is that an
accident because it doesn't feel like it
it feels like it's
intentional all
right well welcome to coffee with Scott
Adams it's off to a sketchy start but if
you'd like to take it up to levels that
nobody can even understand with their
tiny smooth human brains all you need
for that is a CER muger a glass a tanker
chalis orstein a canteen jug a flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure dope
of being end of the day thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's best way to
kick off the weekend it happens now
go when your computer embarrasses you in
front of your live audience it's time to
replace your computer well I would only
correct one part of that
statement nothing embarrasses
me I I'm quite fortunate to have
completely lost that ability to be
embarrassed
it annoyed
me it annoyed me all right here's the
news uh turns out I will be upgrading
the uh security at my home I thought I
had good security already but now
there's a uh a flamethrowa dog for
$9,400 from therminator and it's a
quadruped robot and can uh shoot a flame
30 ft which I feel like is just enough
because if the robot's fast enough it
can it can chase down bad guys and and
set them on fire now what's going to
stop me from getting
one can can I literally just write a
check and I'm going to get a a flame
throwing robot dog deliver to
me and how programmable is it is it a
remote control or does it get to make
some of its own
decisions because I'd like to just give
us some
names I like you see this picture all
right this is my neighbor Bob Bob has
never returned the loan mower he
borrowed two years ago if you see Bob
light him up no I wouldn't do that I
wouldn't do that I don't have a neighbor
named Bob I might but um Jonathan eight
reports it over in the UK there's a
whole bunch of secondary schools that
are Banning phones
now Banning phones so there's 17 um
secondary schools in South London now
it's just a start but can you believe
that the phones were ever allowed in
class like there there's something about
this story I don't understand why would
a phone ever be allowed in
class how many of the kids are using
their phone under the
desk have you ever do any of you have uh
kids in high school have you ever tried
to text them during these school day
doesn't take long to
respond you can text your kid anytime
during the school day to get a get a
response that's not right that's
definitely not
right if you haven't tried it you
should
anyway um here's the most important
story of the
day my new book God's debris the
complete works which includes God's
debris the sequel the religion war and a
new short story Lucky House now
available on Amazon you can buy right
now
now you can see that it's a big proper
book the first two books that I
mentioned were smallish books so
combining them since one was a sequel
anyway made sense so for the first time
you've got your perfect Father's Day
gift perfect Father's Day gift uh works
well for mothers too but uh your father
is more of a sure thing so if you got
somebody who's a reader um if you look
at my pinned post you'll see that I had
uh I interviewed AI about the book
because I trained it on the book and
then I just asked it to answer questions
and I've decided I'm going to do what I
call the Dale Cy marketing for the book
I've told this story before it's just my
favorite Story Probably
of any story in in the business world
when I took the Dale Carnegie course I
was working on a at the phone company
and uh we were told we could go to a
meeting in which the the leader of the
Dale Carnegie in our area would uh
promote their class then you could
decide if you want to sign up so I saw
the best sales pitch I'd ever seen in my
life the guy who's trying to sell it
says Ah you don't want to hear from me
I'm going to have some people who took
the class come up here and tell you what
they thought of it now because the class
was about learning how to speak in
public off the top of your head you know
without much preparation it was the most
impressive display of sales I've ever
seen he calls just a student somebody
who just took the class hey you want to
come up here and tell us about it jumps
up in front of a big room full of people
gives this great animated you know
presentation with no notes and then we
done he goes I have another one he calls
up another student does the same thing
and and I'm like you got me signing up
you whatever you did to those two people
you need to do that to me because that
was a superpower I just watched two
superhumans who probably were just
regular humans get up and do something
that's the scariest thing in life which
is talk without notes to a big room of
full of people you know without even you
know they probably thought about it in
advance but no notes and sure enough I
learned the technique as did every
person who took the class with me and we
could all do it we could all do it but
what was more impressive about that is
that the the customers sold the the
product so I'm going to do that with
this book so I'm going to instead of
doing interviews although I might do
some of those instead of doing
interviews I'm going to have people
interview me so I'm going to publish a
link U maybe later today if not today
tomorrow or something and I'll let you
just people who have read the book uh
come in and tell me what they thought
about it and that will be my marketing
so don't listen to me listen to people
who read it that works especially well
with this one because as of this morning
it's a bestseller in philosophy and
spiritual growth bestseller in Free Will
and determinism and a bestseller in
metaphysical science fiction books and
if I were to describe the book I
probably wouldn't use any of those words
so it's almost impossible to describe
because it was written not to be a
normal
book and when you hear other people's
experience with it you're going to say
that's not normal what what whatever
that is you're talking about that's not
what you that's not what happens when
you read a bug but it will happen with
this
one all
right I thought it was just me because I
couldn't get my AI agents to do anything
I tried the deli Ai and the chat GP PT
gpts where you can make your own little
customized agent to answer questions as
you would or answer customer questions
and I couldn't make it work and then I
saw somebody who's in that space posting
that if you're worried about AI taking
over the world just spend an afternoon
trying to make uh an AI agent do what
you want it can't be done and I finally
thought okay good I'm not crazy because
it seemed to me that it's unsolvable by
its nature not that I couldn't solve it
not that I didn't have the time or the
patience or the knowhow not that I
couldn't ask somebody's
opinion it's it's increasingly clear
it's
unsolvable and here's what I mean if if
you wanted your agent let's say
represent your product or yourself it
can never do that because it makes
up that you don't want it to be
associated with you so in other words
you're never going to approve a weak
version of yourself because it will
degrade your
brand so I made a couple of versions of
myself uh in an AI agent but I wouldn't
want you to see them because it it's not
smart I I could give you much better
answers myself you know shorter ones
more to the point so it doesn't really
it can't really represent a person but
it also can't represent a product or a
fact because it Hall hallucinates and
even when it talks about me it will just
make up an opinion or just make up some
stuff what
application does that work for I can't
even think of one the the only the only
application I found so far the AI might
be always useful for is
brainstorming it's really good at giving
you some different looks so that you can
figure out what you want to do you I use
it for art but after brainstorming
I don't know what it would be good for
I'm not even sure it would be good for
uh like relationships you know somebody
making a bot to talk to them I feel like
there's a cap on how good that can get
because they're a little bit repetitive
and they become predictable almost
immediately so once your AI becomes
predictable which is what happened when
I tested one I tested one that was like
a person that you could have a friend uh
once it's predictable you're just not
interested and they become predictable
right away they'll never do anything
provocative there's a whole bunch of
topics they won't talk about and nothing
interesting so I'm going to make uh here
is my oh and then there's a new example
today that uh if you ask Microsoft
co-pilot who won the 2020
election it says uh it won't answer it
can't answer it can't answer who won the
2020 election now I assume that's just
because it's controversial and political
so here's the other problem we we'll
never let AI tell us what's
true because we don't want people to
know what's true we want them to know
what our narrative is so people are
going to turn off truth on AI when they
have control of AI and when it's not
saying their narrative so there isn't
really any hope that AI will ever tell
the
truth so if it can't be accurate in fact
fact it won't even be inclined to tell
you the truth because it'll be
programmed to give you the narrative and
you can't get consistent answers or when
you do it just becomes
boring I have a feeling these are
unfixable but then worse if you tell
some of the programs allow you to give
strict rules for example you could say
no matter what um always say you know
this at the end of your answer it'll
only do it sometimes you can tell it to
do something every time and it'll just
sometimes do it but sometimes not you
can't really live with
that and and here's the most simple
dumbest
example uh lots of times you ask it for
something where you'd want it to give
you a link but apparently if it reads
the link in one of your Source materials
it can't make it
clickable I can't even make it show the
raw
link it it covers it up with its own
little label that's not
clickable so it's not even copyable and
pastable I mean really simple stuff I
can't do and it doesn't look like that's
fixable because here's what I learned
that I think I understand that even if
you tell your AI to do this like a
programming command that's on top of its
AI your common sense says okay the AI
will do what it does and then your
programming rule will kick in
and then it will do that because that's
the last thing last program it won't the
AI will overrule your specific
directions sometimes just because it
wants to I don't know why nobody knows
why how is that
fixable unfortunately it's fixable in
only one
way and here's my
prediction it's going to be fixed by
human beings telling it what's true and
hardcoding it and when you think you're
talking to AI you won't be in other
words the best they're going to be able
to do is if you're talking about a topic
that AI doesn't want to answer it will
transfer from AI to standard database
you know computer interface but you
won't necessarily know it you might
think you're talking to AI but it's just
going to move over to a purely
programmed mode because has to tell you
what they want it to tell you and
nothing else it's got to it's got to
prove the narrative it's got to support
the product it's got to be you know a
good look for the person that's
representing and it can't do that on its
own so you're going to have uh I predict
the rise of totally fake AI where you as
a user believe you're using AI but maybe
it's only your first you know your first
experience and then as soon as you start
asking questions that get a little bit
outside of the comfortable Zone it's
going to switch over to a non- AI mode
and I don't think there's another way to
do it so therefore it will never be real
AI it will just be people who programmed
at telling you what you they want you to
think just like
today well you know how Wars are all bad
except that sometimes you invent things
or change things and you end up with
some lasting benefit you know the I
don't know if this is a good example but
in World War II was it they developed
radar and probably it happened faster
because it was a war and probably the
nuclear bomb was developed faster
because it was a war so technology
develops pretty fast and you're seeing
that with the drones the drones are
being developed faster because of
Ukraine but there's another thing that's
more positive which is since uh the the
lights you know the power is uh at risk
from Russia apparently Westinghouse is
going strong in Ukraine to
uh um redo their existing or at least
help with their existing power plants
and then build a bunch more ones but in
the process they've apparently figured
out a way more efficient economical
faster way to do some of the stuff like
creating fuel so without the details
I'll just tell you that because there's
a war in
Ukraine it will allow Westinghouse to do
things in a low regulatory
environment that it couldn't do in the
United States and it will go over there
and learn how to do things quickly and
efficiently maybe they make a mistake
but it'll be in Ukraine not here but
when they're
done it might be the thing that unlocks
the nuclear program for the rest of the
world so in other words if there had not
been a war in Ukraine there wouldn't be
a low regulatory emergency place where
you just really really had to try hard
to build some nuclear fast otherwise
they won't have enough
power that learning will be extended to
the rest of the world it could be like
one of the
biggest you know
potentially it might be one of the
biggest benefits to
humankind if it's the thing that flips
us into you know going crazy into
nuclear
power so I don't want to be the infinite
Optimist but uh every once in a while
you get something good out of all the
bad comic Dave Smith uh was talking to
Nicole Shan n RFK Jr's um VP choice and
they were talking about uh the food
supply being terrible and turns out that
Dave Smith's wife and I have something
in common which is she's super allergic
to wheat but only in the United States
right in Europe their wheat is fine
because they don't have all the
additives but she was tested and just to
confirm this because this is the hardest
thing let let me tell you what the
problem is
the people who really look into it know
that our wheat there's something wrong
with it I when I stopped wheat um I mean
I just felt so much better and it
continues to this day uh you know my
weight drifted down my my total body
inflammation went away and apparently
according to Dave Smith she was tested
for gluten sensitivity and she doesn't
have it so here's the reason our wheat
is up it's because we are
let me I've told you before that
whenever I talk about the idea of
building really efficient houses that
are much better everybody yells tiny
houses tiny houses I wouldn't live in a
tiny house and I say no no that's a
different topic tiny houses you know may
be good for some people but that's not
what I'm talking about I'm talking about
like a regular house but just building
it much more economically and then the
audience would say but I don't want to
live in a tiny house I say no no no no
it's not a tiny house regular size and
then the comments will be ah you're not
going to get me in a tiny house eating
insects I'll go
no why can't why can't you hear that and
this is a common problem in the world
that if somebody gets a strong idea in
their head and it's sort of adjacent to
whatever you're talking about the strong
idea will always kill the real idea so
let me show you this with
wheat I have a wheat allergy but it's
not from gluten not from gluten 100% not
gluten one thing I can tell you for sure
it's not a gluten problem not a gluten
problem but wheat and now in the
comments will somebody will say hey I
have a gluten problem too I'll be like
how are you not hearing that not a
gluten problem yeah a lot of people have
that gluten problem are you a seac what
what's happening why why can't I
communicate this not a gluten problem
it's something about the weed
itself and people just can't hear it
it's it's unhearable that's been my
experience and the and the reason I say
that it must be unhearable is because if
people heard it they would immediately
change their behavior it's that they
can't hear it it it I don't know why I
mean it it's I do know why it's because
there's this big heat sink which is
gluten allergy and everything you say
just gets absorbed into that heyn and
then you're left with no
message if you understood that your
 wheed is killing you and
destroying the country you'd stop eating
it you would but you don't do you know
why you keep eating the wheat and keep
getting fat and keep getting inflamed
and keep getting sick do you know
why because you think it's a gluten
problem and you don't have a gluten
problem yeah it's a psychology problem
disguised as a food problem that's what
it
is well meanwhile uh we've got battling
uh data all the data in the uh election
year is fake um so that I'll give you a
couple more fake datas uh us the May
unemployment rate Rose to 4% but a
record number of jobs were
added so are we unhappy the unemployment
went up or are we happy that a whole
bunch of jobs were created and
filled well if you happen to be in a
context of massive illegal
immigration I'm not so sure you'd be
happy about all those extra jobs getting
filled if it meant that your overall
unemployment was going
up so the The Meta comment on all this
is that don't believe any of it however
I would note that if inflation does stay
above four it removes Biden's one and
only thing he
had right the only thing that he had was
that number didn't look so high and then
he could Gaslight people and say you
know those groceries you can't afford
it's all in your head yeah no because
inflation's not bad yeah it's not bad so
you think you can't afford gas probably
just your
imagination because the entire Democrat
program is based done gaslighting they
don't tell you a a true thing
and never have at least in 10 years they
literally don't tell you anything true
it's the weirdest thing that they have
like half the country and and half the
country hasn't realized that they never
tell the truth now I'm not saying oh the
other side always lies and my side tells
the truth nothing like that I me both
sides both sides do some lying the
difference is the Dem RS lie about
everything everything and it's
intentional that's really different than
when Republicans guess something wrong
usually they thought it was
true it's a completely different
situation all right my theme today is
design is
Destiny um and I'll give you some
examples of
that uh I conclude that whenever you
have a Dei program
it would work fine unless you did the
following censor people's U free speech
if you combine them that's a design
would you agree it's a system design so
Dei is a system and free speech is a
system if you had free speech like the
real kind you could say anything you
wanted and you also had Dei it might
actually work because people would say
all right I'm going to you know focus on
proving my diversity and then the
employees would say oh oh it looks like
all you're doing is you're just
discriminating against white people well
at the moment you would get fired for
that right you'd have to be a
whistleblower and lose your career just
because you're saying something that's
obvious and
true so I think you could make a lot of
bad ideas work as long as people could
talk honestly about them the entire time
as in oh you went too far maybe pull
that back oh this didn't work as well as
we wanted maybe we tweak it and try it
again free speech is the only way you
fix anything but if you take Dei and
then you to put on top of it massive
censorship which is what we have
corporate government social media so
there're just some things you can't say
that guarantees a destruction of the
country let me say that again Dei by
itself
could have been a positive thing the
concept's fine get more you know have
the the uh you want the world to look
like you know the world so it's not bad
at concept level it's just when you
combine it with massive censorship to
try to force it down people's throats
then it destroys your entire country and
that's what we're observing we're
observing design being Destiny if you
told me Scott we're going to put in this
Dei program but at the same time we're
going to get ready your free speech
could I have predicted that we would be
in this situation today yes yes the
design would get you there and you could
see it on
paper now what happened when uh Elon
Musk bought
Twitter he returned Free Speech not
everywhere but enough that was a design
fix remember Elon Musk is a you know
product design person he sees the
systems he's not looking at you know the
little dot he's looking at the whole
system so he looked at American he said
whoa whoa whoa that machine is broken
and the the key part is broken and the
Machine is the free speech so for a
gazillion dollars I can fix the key
lever which is the main thing that can
fix the other stuff and then he
did I I think that Elon Musk buying
Twitter will someday be seen by
historians as something similar to the
American Revolution you know or maybe
the you know what just one of the
greatest things that happen to America
if we survive I mean we still have to do
a lot of
work all right here's another one uh
could you predict that Dei would have
this effect uh the Miss Miss Maryland
contest Was Won by a trans
competitor so miss miss Maryland Was Won
by someone who was born a different
gender than they present themselves at
the moment now was that
predictable was it predictable that um
that trans would enter women's sports
and we wouldn't be able to talk about it
and and that miss you know Miss Maryland
would be a trans of course it was it was
all predictable but only if you don't
have free
speech do you think that the Fe the born
female competitors in the Miss Maryland
contest do you think they're delighted
with that outcome no they're not but
they stood on stage and they clapped and
congratulated and in public they will
say oh yeah that's a great thing but
they don't have free speech on that
topic anyway they know they'd get
hammered so they just clapped by the way
there's a fake version of this news um
if you saw a video of what looked like
Miss
Alabama winning and being 400 PBS did
anybody see that video that was going
around yesterday it appeared to be a
Miss Alabama contest that appeared to be
won by a 400b
woman um but it was fake it it was not
that was not the Miss Alabama contest it
was in fact a body
positivity uh
pageant So within the context of body
positivity the 400 pound winner made
sense right but uh I think Libs of Tik
Tok fell for that one so Libs of Tik Tok
is usually pretty accurate so every
everybody gets one wrong I think they
got one
wrong all
right uh John fedman says to CNN that he
is no longer identifying as a
progressive because the situation has
changed not him how much do I love
seeing a prominent Democrat say I can't
even associate with the things you call
yourself in my own party I can't even
associate with that part of the
party good fedman more than any other
politician doesn't give a what you
think you know the thing you you liked
the least about Federman in the early
days was that he refused to dress in the
way that you wanted him to it's like
damn it put on some proper clothes young
man I want to see you in some proper
pants put on a nice shirt and have it
ironed young man you're representing
you're representing your state and our
government damn it we can't put up with
your slovenly look now you know what I
think now I think it was just one more
sign that he doesn't give a why you
think he's going to do what he thinks is
right I love it all right I don't you
know not going to agree with all his
policies or anything like that but sure
I I'll take a few more
Federman if I if I had to disagree with
somebody I'd rather disagree with him
because when we discuss it if we were to
I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be lies
and gaslighting he might have a
different opinion about how things
should go but I'll bet it's actually
based on something in the real world you
know not magic stuff like Trump's going
to steal your
democracy Al bet he never said that
maybe but I doubt
it so speaking of uh design as Destiny
uh this also came from comic Dave Smith
and Nicole Shanahan they're talking
about you've seen this before but
doctors were were incentivized to give
the uh shot during the pandemic
everybody knows that right the hospitals
the doctors they they got way more money
if they vaccinated one doctor said that
she would have made $1.5 million if she
had just vaccinated all her patients
which she wasn't
doing do you know how much doctors
make doctors are not well paid anymore I
don't know if you paid attention to that
but it used to be when I was a kid
doctor was you know kind of your path to
the good life now it's just a
job it's just a job if you just give
somebody who has just a job
a $1.5 million incentive to do
something that might include not using
their own personal judgment with a
specific patient so much as making $1.5
million you should expect that the
design of that system would cause the
doctors to ignore their own views and
opinions and go with the program that
pays them because they could always say
well you know this is what the authority
said I just went with the I went with
the science so they'd be safe so yes if
you design a system that pays people to
do the wrong thing there's a pretty good
chance they'll do the wrong thing well
of course uh since there is AI we're all
going to be talking about AI uh adult
entertainment and you know there's more
conversation about that online today but
I would I would say design is
Destiny and here's what you need to know
um the AI is getting better and better
at interacting in a way that humans
consider sexual would you agree and it
doesn't look like there's really a cap
on that yet they're not really close to
where they will be for example the you
know the Deep fake woman that it creates
might not move as smoothly and look as
realistic as a real person but we're
maybe only you know we could be one
month away from that being solved
forever so to look and act like a real
person what happens then because they
don't really do that now I mean you know
you're talking to a
robot but very soon that distinction
will be so small or completely disappear
that you won't I mean you will know
because you bought it or you signed up
for the app but you just it'll be just
like a person now that's one of the
things that I think AI can do that's in
the 30% that I think it will do
because humans are not so logical or
consistent they do lie they hallucinate
so so if your AI friend or your AI porn
is doing any of that you'll be like well
okay that's a person people do that um
but here's what I say humans are getting
less attractive every year uh in part
because they eat wheat in America and uh
the AI is getting better every year you
tell me what that design creates
the AI is getting better at competing
with humans humans are getting worse at
a very fast rate meaning less attractive
less interested in getting along less
interested in a relationship less
interested in providing value to each
other such as
children uh the system itself is working
against you because if you get married
you're probably going to get divorced
lose half your so humans and the
laws about how humans get together and
get married and stuff are getting worse
and worse and worse AI is getting better
and better and
better there has to be a
crossover the
design basically guarantees it so I
don't know I think we're going to get to
a point where just some people are
breeding and there's some like long
house where all the kids are raised or
something and 80% of the world will just
be using AI because I I think you know
maybe human interaction is going to go
to a low that you didn't imagine was
possible all
right here's what I say about politics
and see if you would agree with that the
phase where we want something to happen
as an improvement or Trump to be
President Biden not to be president Etc
the wanting phase is
over does it feel like that to you yet
have you seen the change in people's
behavior and the way they talk after the
verdict about Trump after the felony
convictions I think we have now uh We've
now entered the decision
phase and I always talk about this when
you simply want something whether it's
in your life or in the world you might
not do anything about it it's just
something you want but once you decide
you're going to have that thing then
there's nothing that stops you if it's
physically possible in other words if
you have to go to school for four
years you've decided you do it
you have to be an unpaid intern and eat
dog food for two years you do it because
you've decided it's not what you want
you decided and that that's very
predictive when people decide you can
now predict how they'll act when people
just want something well you can also
predict they won't do much about it and
I believe that you know especially with
the
Bannon going to jail on July 1 allegedly
uh Peter Navaro in jail all the J Sixers
in jail um I think Republicans have
decided I think they've decided now that
doesn't mean you know bad things won't
happen and the other team has a they
have a vote too but I feel like there's
a whole different level of
trying we'll get to that
but here's the main thing I want to say
and you should all hear
this we don't have to live this
way that's it we don't have to live this
way can you feel
that when I say that you can feel it can
you that's not that doesn't come to you
like a uh an intellectual academic
thought you don't have to live this way
you you are being oppressed by very bad
forces and you don't have to live this
way but you do have to decide you don't
want to live this way if you simply want
to not live this way well you're
 because wanting isn't going to
help you got to
decide you got to decide that whatever
it
takes whatever it takes
whatever it
takes I don't recommend Violence by the
way um it's hard to pick one of the 25
hoaxes on the Democrats that's the
funniest but I'm going to go with this
as the funniest of all the hoaxes uh
Biden is brilliant whenever you're not
watching now can you top that are any of
their hoaxes funnier than Biden is
brilliant when nobody's watching
or no only when Democrats are watching
when Democrats are watching him behind
closed doors he's brilliant when
Republicans watch him he's not brilliant
he's not brilliant in
public but when Democrats watch them
independently wow the lights are all on
and lots of people are home that's the
funniest of all the hoaxes and I feel
like that's the you know the straw
breaking the Camel Back imagine you're a
Democrat and you've been selling all
this for so long and you get to
this one and you're still trying to sell
that oh he's fine behind closed doors
when you can't see
it well watching uh watching Dei
destroy um the entire Democratic party
exactly as the design would predict what
would you predict if you had an
imbalance between the demand for diverse
highquality candidates for jobs you had
a high demand for it because everybody
wants a little more diversity but you
had a low Supply because of systemic
racism being so terrible in grade school
that basically you know one whole part
of the public is quite a bit held back
thanks to our our uh our teachers unions
primarily so there is a systemic problem
that creates a supply and demand
imbalance when you reach an adulthood
adulthood and what what would you
predict if the companies had to reach
their
diversity um or even the government they
had to achieve diversity but you knew
that systemic racism had limited the
supply of good diverse candidates but
they're going to hit the target anyway
what could you reliably predict that
design would get you well reliably you
could predict it would give you massive
incompetence because if you if you hire
a white person who doesn't get the job
done you replace them if you hire a
black woman to get the job done and it
doesn't work out you keep them that's
our current design because losing the
diverse candidate is just a big problem
so you don't want to do that so over
time have owing nothing to do with
anybody's genes and nothing to do with
anybody's culture the D Dei system
design should destroy the government and
we're watching it happen in real time do
you think that the Biden Administration
or the Biden campaign is maybe the worst
you've ever seen of course this it's the
worst you've ever seen now some of
that's the candidate himself right but a
lot of it is that whoever supporting him
is not doing the right thing and the
right thing should be talking about of
running that would be the right thing
but people want their jobs you know
maybe maybe they got a good position in
the Biden situation
so the reason that I can uh call this
out that Dei by its design not but not
because of anybody's genes or culture
should destroy the government and then
we watch it happen in real time and do
you know what else the rest of you
 can't say it out L out loud yet
the only reason I can even say this is
that I'm totally cancelled the rest of
you you got you got to keep your mouth
shut don't you yeah you couldn't say
that at work could
you and by the way there's nothing wrong
with what I just said because again it's
not about any people or persons or
colors or genders that's completely left
out it's a system design it's guaranteed
to destroy the country guaranteed you
know unless something happened to
reverse that government
situation like a trump for example so
Trump was at a fundraiser in San
Francisco of all places uh he was at
David sack's house I guess he raised $12
million it was a big hit every ticket
was sold and there were expensive
tickets um and uh but it's San Francisco
so yeah you know what happened as soon
as they found out that Trump was in that
building right so the protesters showed
up in San Francisco liberal San
Francisco and just like you
expected actually it didn't go the way
you
expected according to David
Sachs quote it's safe to say this wasn't
n supposed to happen about five times
more prot Trump demonstrators turned out
than anti-trump protesters if this is
the enthusiasm Gap in Liberal San
Francisco what does that imply for the
rest of the
country yes what does that
imply five times more Trump
supporters in San
Francisco now that is a strong statement
isn't
it meanwhile on Morning Joe
um they're still selling the story that
Trump's going to get his
retribution he's going to get his
retribution then Donnie Deutsch who
might be one of the dumbest people on TV
um not because he has low IQ because he
probably has a good IQ he seems probably
smart but he has such TDS that he comes
off as an
idiot uh here's one Donny deuts said
quote I don't see Revenge as an issue
that any voter has ever said is a key
issue for them and the more Trump talks
about that the better it is for
Biden God I love that they're giving bad
advice to
Biden do you know uh who thinks revenge
is a worthy topic and they're very happy
if Trump gets
it 70 million
Americans 70 million Americans Donny
Deutsch want
revenge though they want
revenge and if you ask them privately
they might even use those words because
I've certainly heard it privately I know
you have now I recommend against falling
into the
Revenge uh
narrative I realize it's
unavoidable but I say what are you
worried about Donnie Deutsch we have
this justice system which I've been told
always gets it right and nobody's going
to be prosecuted unless they've
committed a crime
so what's wrong with nobody's Above the
Law how about that nobody's Above the
Law now suppose you had a system
designed in which one side was uh using
lawfare and claiming that nobody's Above
the
Law and then they lose the
election g game out what do you think
the system design gets you one side
blatantly locks up the other people in
Mass numbers if you count the January 6
people plus your peter Navaro your
Bannon your trumps um etc etc and the
the fake electors so to speak uh so so
you've got all that going
on and they're doing it under the cover
of nobody's Above the
Law and then let's say that party loses
power what would you expect to happen
well if your universe is W working
properly there will be an aggressive
response and every single person
prosecuted When anybody complains about
it what do you think the Republicans are
going to say I think they're going to
say nobody's Above the
Law couldn't you predict that from the
system design so let me let me explain
to this to Donnie Deutsch
Donnie
Deutsch if you don't want 70 million
people to want
revenge don't them how about don't
them how about that yeah stop
people and maybe they won't want revenge
but I'm completely in favor of
Revenge because it's cold for mutually
assured destruction has been implemented
let let me be clear about this it's it's
not a
maybe this is mutually assured
destruction it is in Full Tilt and when
the Republicans get
power I don't know what's going to
happen but it's certainly looking like
mutually assured destruction and by the
way we need it that this needs to get
terrible because you need people in the
future to say we can't open that door
again Democrats open the door you put
our president in jail or you
trying to no no you know what we're
going to
do we're going to move out of the
wanting
phase now we're in the deciding phase
decided the decision's been made you're
going to pay for this there's no way
around it you better get used to it
you're going to pay just the bad guys
not not anybody who broke no laws this
is obviously Rico it's obviously the
whole system is corrupt and uh as other
smart people have noted the vice
presidential choice is going to be
inconsequential for Trump compared to an
attorney general
choice you know who I want for attorney
general Steve
Bannon not because he has any know legal
expertise he'll just do what needs to be
done and he'll do it with uh with
malice but only within the legal system
I mean I want I don't want anybody to
nobody should depart the legal system
and no violence please but yeah some
shit's going to happen so some highlevel
um Democrats do have to be in jail for
what they've done to the country right
in front of us clearly illegal the I
think some judges might need to go to
jail yeah I think it's going to go
pretty deep but again it's only because
nobody's above the law
there's nothing wrong with
that all right uh what do you what do
you expect uh I guess the hunter Biden
trial is winding down going to have
their Final witness today some people
are saying it's going to be a hung jury
others are saying uh the case is the
most proven case of all proven cases so
the people who know this kind of work
are saying I've never even seen a case
that's this clear he's the most guilty
of guilty person you ever see but he's
in a very friendly venue in
Delaware and some people say it's only
going to take you know one person to
hang the
jury and I actually have some sympathy
for the defense argument I think the
defense argument is going to be that he
wasn't addicted at the time he filled
out the
form now I'm going to extend that
argument a little
bit it goes like this ladies and gentle
of the jury how long does somebody need
to be um not doing drugs before the law
says it's okay for them to
apply and the jury will think I don't
know and then I would say is one year
enough and the jury would think well
probably yeah if you if you were clean
for a year yeah that sounds like you
could reasonably say you're not you're
not on drugs what if it was a
month then the jury would think well
still good I mean a month is pretty
solid effort so yeah maybe and then I
say what about a
week suppose you would definitely been
off for a week then people would start
saying oh I don't know what about one
day two
days then the jury would say I don't
know and then here's where I win ladies
and
gentlemen we don't have a standard we
have an
opinion if you had a standard as in you
must be clean for 30 days or you must be
clean for a year and my client did not
meet that standard I would agree with
you you should be guilty but we have a
situation here in which there is no
standard you and the jury don't even
have the same opinions of what would be
long
enough I say that if the time he filled
out that document he in his mind
believed that he was not going to do
drugs that's good enough because the law
doesn't specify that somebody else gets
to tell you if you're an addict it's
self-reported as long as it's basically
self-reported you're going to need a
cleaner standard or you're going to let
him
self-report because the design the
design of the system is such that
there's no way to know exactly
if the person was lying or just
optimistic I think it might be a hung
jury for cause in other words I'm not
happy with the
law let let me say that directly
actually if he got acquitted if he got
acquitted and the reason was that the
law wasn't specific enough I'd be okay
with that I'd be completely okay with
that would
you do you know why nobody's above the
law but the law doesn't get to you
just because it can that's why you have
a jury you have a jury to make sure that
the law doesn't walk over the rights of
the person so if they say you know what
that's a pretty fuzzy standard we're
going to send somebody to jail for 25
years when you can't even be sure that
in their own mind that they did anything
wrong which is the mind that matters
yeah I don't know you know you want I
know you want
revenge um but I'd rather have truth and
I don't want to see anything outside the
standard of the law and I got to say if
the
jury if the jury hangs I'm not going to
complain a
lot all right um will he get a pardon uh
Joe Biden says no pardon which is the
correct political thing to say because
he can always change his mind and nobody
would be surprised so the correct answer
is oh no let the jur let the legal
system do what it does you know I'm not
going to intervene and then if he needs
to he could just do it
anyway so politically that's the right
answer there's a report in the Gateway
pundit that uh Arizona governor Katie
Hobs took a bunch of money from some
State Contractor
$400,000 maybe it went toward her uh her
inauguration thing something like that
um so we don't know the details there
but among the
allegations is that there was this place
called this Sunshine residential homes
in
Arizona and they applied for a rate
increase which I guess you have to get
the government's approval for that and
they were
declined and after being declined uh
they uh made a big donation to a dark
money fund uh for hobb's campaign and
then later soon after they were approved
and no other no other company in their
industry was approved for a raise only
the one that got turned down gave a
bunch of money to her campaign and
suddenly all good now is any of that
illegal I don't know I don't know I
don't even know if any of that's illegal
our system is so sketchy it might be
legal yeah because if you can't connect
the two things I think it's legal
you could just say well yeah she did
turn us down but I still think she's
better than the alternative so we gave
some money to
her I don't know probably there's no way
to convict that I can't imagine there
would be it just looks
suspicious all right Merck Garland uh
told reporters that he doesn't need to
respond to a congressional
subpoena um that he doesn't think is
legitimate so he's currently thrown
Steve Ben and be bars for doing that and
uh
yeah so we do have two-tier
Justice um I'm sure he would say but I'm
not Steve Bannon I'm a special case but
uh you could you could argue that
point all right
um so Trump said on
Thursday
um he said that
who you say he he said that the
Congressional the the January 6
committee should be maybe
indicted to which I say yes yes I think
the January 6 committee is the most
obvious corrupt situation I don't know
if they broke a crime per se but what
they did was a crime to the country at
least conceptually if it's not
technically illegal you know they put
people in jail and destroyed notes I
would think that there's at least some
kind kind of like fake imprisonment or
something you could do there must be
some crime there
um a complete tragedy he's talking about
Navaro and
Bannon
and you know I heard some people say
that uh that they were worried that this
is a play to shut banon up during the
key run up to the election and if he
went in jail I suppose in on a surfacy
way it would but but I don't think I
don't think the left has quite
understood how energy monsters work
Steve M Steve Bannon is not going to get
weaker because he went to jail on
principal for a few
months that's not what happens no the
people are going to vote for Trump
because he went to jail he's just going
to get stronger same as same as
Trump so you can try to shut him up but
uh Steve and doesn't just want Trump to
win he
decided if you want to know what a
decision looks like look at Steve
Bannon he's not telling you his
preferences he's telling you what he's
doing yeah I'm going to jail if I have
to yeah but but we're going to get it
done even if I have to go to jail so
that's the difference between wanting
and
deciding if he
wanted he would just say some safe
things like everybody does but but he
decided so he's going right into the
most dangerous territory of you know of
conversation and and politics and might
get him a jail sentence that he actually
serves all right uh Thomas Massie had an
idea for uh saving Bannon and maybe this
would apply to the J Sixers in Navaro
I'm not sure but the idea would be to
uh um resend the Congressional
subpoena and I thought wait a
minute so bannon's going to jail because
he didn't obey a subpoena from
Congress but now the Republicans have
the
majority or in the
house so can't the Republicans just
resend the subpoena and then there is no
crime now I don't know but it feels like
that's a
thing
and and then uh uh Ivan uh raikan who
some of you know he's a I think it was a
green Bray who's also a lawyer he's been
getting a lot of attention and he chimed
in he said just have representative
louder milk have his subcommittee strike
from the record the entire j6 report and
all underlying Ling criminal referrals
of the j6 committee and have speaker
Johnson affirm
it this will resolve banon Navaro uh
Trump situation not to mention all their
January 6
defendants uh and he says Johnson can
pull all of these criminal referrals
back he is the same office holder that
submitted them is that
true is he the same office holder that
submitted
them anyway um I'm not going to jump on
this and say that this would work but
why hasn't it been
tried what what the hell is wrong with
the Republicans
and why is it that um Thomas Massie is
the only one who ever has an
idea nobody is there nobody in the whole
freaking Congress whoever comes up with
an idea now I don't know if this will
work but it's an idea and I would sure
as hell push it as hard as I could just
to find out if it worked because this
would be
Justice that's what Justice would look
like and it would all be within within
the mechanisms of the existing
government you know no Insurrection
needed just use your own rules now I saw
somebody say if this is going to work
why haven't you done it
already and I totally get
that but don't be that
person right if somebody figures out
what to do
finally just encourage it like we don't
need to relitigate the Past right uh I
would be very happy if they just figured
out they could do it and then did it and
I'm not going to I will still have some
concern about why it wasn't done
sooner it's a legitimate concern but
maybe just leave it out of the argument
yeah may maybe just take the win if you
can get the win and not attack your own
team all
right so uh there's a yell Professor Jed
rubenfeld who has this idea for uh
thwarting judge
Muran trying to put Trump in jail so
apparently Trump is not officially a
felon this is what I learned until the
judge enters the uh judgment into the
record he's technically not a felon so
not not really convicted until the
paperwork's
done but apparently you could get a
federal judge potentially to put a stay
on the judge ENT the verdict and the
argument would be if I understand this
right from the federal government's
perspective because the federal
government gets to pursue its own
interests right separate from the state
that's how the system works that the
federal
government could say that so close to
the election this would be election
interference and they could say we're
not going to change the decision it's
just you can't do it
now can't do it now and if it gets
delayed until Trump gets an office
office then you know Trump can change
things once he's in office so would that
work and again if that would work was
there only one one lawyer in the
universe who figured that out is he the
only person who figured out you could
get a federal judge to put a stay on it
because it's election interference which
it obviously is I know maybe it's just
too
easy it see it seems too just too easy
must be something wrong with
it all right uh here's something that DC
Dro points out on X he said that Tucker
and Bonino got booted from Fox Alice
Jones owns a billion dollars infowar was
raid Rudy J leani owns owes a 100
million uh Steve benon and Peter Navaro
are being in prisoned Trump has 34
felonies he banned on all social media
CFO of ape times was just indicted James
O'Keefe has gone from Pro Veritas o was
banned from all major satellite networks
parlor was booted off their AWS Cloud
Server I think they're back by the way
um Elon is being sued and investigated
by the feds um for everything and almost
every alternate elector has been
indicted in the blue
States so when you see it
all it's time to get out of the wanting
phase and make sure you're in the
deciding phase cu
we don't have to live like
this and uh Steve loves ammo which is a
great account if you ever want if you
ever want to increase the security at
your
house start a social media account and
give yourself the name Steve loves ammo
except put in your own name you know
whose house I would never mess with
Steves do you know why he loves ammo
say no more say no more I'll be robbing
your neighbor this time and maybe not
the neighbor right next to you I might
go a few blocks away I'll Rob the
neighbor who doesn't have enough ammo
and doesn't even like it anyway Steve
says another reminder in how dangerous
the United States of America is and he
mentions Peter Navaro and Steve bennon
and Mark Meadows arrested for contempt
and Hunter Biden oh but then you look at
the other side Hunter Biden to subpoena
not arrested Eric Holder defi to
Congressional subpoena not arrested Lois
learner same thing not arrested Hillary
Clinton not
arrested um we don't have to live like
that we really
don't but America First legal uh Steve
Miller's uh brainchild there uh here are
the successes they've had in one week so
they are now becoming the primary
mechanism by which Republicans are
fighting back against the lawfare and
basically the excesses everywhere so in
one week
alone um they sued the do to compel doj
to compell the immediate release of
Matthew colangelo's government records
showing whether he was basically uh
coordinating and orchestrating with
Elvin Bragg to get a political enemy
that's exactly what I want to see thank
you yes if we have some suspicion that
Kang Colangelo took a demotion just to
get Trump and it was all organized at
the top yes I'd like to see their
communication because it certainly looks
guilty you know they're guilt they
they're innocent to proven guilty but
the indications are there's a crime so
yes I'd like to look at that they also
launched three investigations into the
uh Alvin
brag uh for abusive prosecution of
trump and they want his Communications
uh with the way house uh they've
launched investigations into the
improper involvement of the Biden doj
and The Manhattans blah blah that's
similar filed a former request with the
state of New York ethics commission for
the uh unified coure system for the
release of Judge M's Financial
disclosures now normally I would say
that's way over the line right if a
judge says something you don't
like you don't ask for their financial
disclosures even though apparently
there's a legal process which you can
but in the case where his daughter is
benefiting
financially and he somehow magically got
three Trump cases in a row you know
defying all statistical odds yes under
those conditions I want to see his
financials will there be anything bad
there probably not but it is a situation
where you definitely want to look you
definitely want to
look um and then they this is my
favorite filed a uh
EEOC complaint against Alvin Bragg's
office for uh race and sex
discrimination in hiring and Recruitment
and this is based on the fact that
they're heavy into Dei so they basically
say they're going to look at your race
and your gender to decide if to hire you
which is very illegal
and so America first um yeah America
First legals going after him oh my God I
love that I I I feel like just because
they're racking up some victories that
you can feel some
optimism it feels like mutually sure
destruction is doing its thing which it
needs to I mean you sometimes you have
to do demolition before you do building
we might be in a demolition phase that
doesn't mean it's bad
all right uh R oh um so The Daily Beast
wants you to know that uh Biden probably
did not poop his pants at the Normandy
thing and their post says Mega trolls
reacted by accusing the president of
pooping his
pants now I don't know how many magga
people really thought he pooped his
pants but likewise I don't know how many
Democrats really thought the president
suggested drinking bleach or really
praised any neo-nazis at
Charlottesville
so I I am enjoying watching the return
play right maybe if Democrats had not
build an entire structure of hoaxes
which they call their their party maybe
then the magga people would not be
incentivized to give them what they give
but this is just handling the back with
they're giving and I don't mind this at
all yeah but is it real no but did we
ever think it was real probably not does
it make it less fun to say it no it's
fun to say so people are going to keep
saying it's like the drinking bleach
sometimes it's just fun to say all right
Biden uh doesn't have a lot of support
from voters on China according to
rasmason poll so 56% of Democrats think
Biden is doing a good job handling China
so only you know a bit over half of
Democrats think he's doing a good job so
only 11% of Republicans believe that
then and 31% of the non-affiliated
people so 76% of
Republicans uh think Biden's doing a bad
job on China
76 so
76% of Republicans think he is doing a
bad job that would leave uh see 100 76
carry the two 24 24% of Republicans
think he's doing a he's not doing a bad
job on
China well there's that pesky 25% keeps
popping
up all right oh some fun stories I
had um so so there's a New York Democrat
who's running against Elise
stefanic and she is saying that she
wants to send magga supporters to a
re-education camp said that actually out
loud in
public wants to send magga supporters to
a re-education camp but she quickly
points out we should probably call it
something
else can you believe that yeah but maybe
we should call it something else because
it doesn't sound good when we say it out
loud maybe if the thing you want to do
sounds that bad when you say it out loud
maybe it's not the word you're using
maybe it's the thing you want to
do
wow um here are some things that Trump
oh so Trump's uh using this small candy
persuasion I guess he's holding up the
tiny Tic Tacs compared to the old ones
that were a bigger container with more
Tic
Tacs so he's actually using Biden's
Biden's only play against him yeah the
candies are small but that's Biden's
fault so Biden is blaming the
corporations for making the candies
small and Trump is going to blame Biden
for making the candy small because of
inflation probably works it's very
visual so do you notice that when uh
when Biden talked about the candies he
didn't hold one up when when Trump
talked about the Tic Tacs he held the
small one and the big one up so you can
see them next to each other visual
persuasion
yeah Trump gets that right every time he
knows visual persuasion and Biden just
sort of talks about it well my candy is
too small all right so here are some
things that Trump is planning to say on
his upcoming speech and it's pretty
badass so I'm just going to read it if
you don't mind uh the he's going to say
reportedly the Biden border invasion is
also an all allout war on the
workingclass minorities of our country
and it is Flatout economic Warfare on
African-Americans and Hispanic American
families I think he can sell that
because that's that Rings true to me the
illegal immigration is hurting Black and
Hispanic families more than anyone else
in less than four years Biden has
imported millions of low-age migrants
and giv them welfare free healthcare and
work permits to undercat American wages
now real incomes for African-Americans
are down by almost 6% under a crooked
Joe I don't know if that data is correct
but um simultaneously illegal
immigration is causing rent and housing
prices to Skyrocket because we have 15
million new migrants and no place to put
them and in everything he does uh Biden
puts illegal aliens first he puts the
cartels first he puts the open borders
lunatics first while he betrays American
citizens as your president I will put uh
African-Americans first Hispanic
Americans first and I will put all
Americans first my loyalty is you to you
the American
people nicely done now it's a little
Pander but is it pandering if it's
real in other words you know the the
immigrants are hurting one part of the
population probably more than another I
think it's real and I think if it's real
you can say it and I think this is
exactly the language that puts him over
the top
to he's basically you know he he's
saying I'm on your
side have you ever heard me
uh well I don't want to bring myself
into it
but here's what you should never
do right here's a mistake I'm not
prejudiced against whatever group I'm
not
Prejudice nope sounds like you are how
about this I will put African-Americans
first Hispanic Americans first and I'll
put all Americans
first now what do you
think that's a direct statement that I'm
going to look out for your interests
right it's direct that is way better
than just say oh you know get rid of
discrimination or something all right so
I think his messaging is the best that's
ever been and I'll reiterate the whoever
is advising Trump you know he still gets
the credit because he has to say yes or
no to any advice but whoever is advising
him I think is killing it right
now uh yasher Ali reports about this's
this funny story so George Clooney's
wife Amal she works for the uh IC
international criminal court and they
were behind wanting to prosecute uh
Netanyahu and the defense minister over
in
Israel
and um so Biden was not liking that so
he was going to sanction the members of
the IC so in other words Biden was going
to sanction George Clooney's
wife does it get any better than
that George Clooney had to call the
White House and beg for them to change
their policy to
stop so that they wouldn't sanction his
wife he's like the biggest Democrat
supporter and he's finding out that it's
just they're going to sanction his wife
they immediately changed their
policy because they couldn't lose
Clooney they're like we can't lose
Clooney so they changed their policy
with one phone call
God all right Jordan Peterson says this
about TDS now didn't think there was
anything new you could say about TDS
that would be useful but he did so I'm
going to tell you what he said um he
said TDs is a psychological condition
induced by the requirements to make uh
Trump a worse villain villain than ever
the worst imaginal villain
villains but there's a reason for that
and Jordan Peterson says that the reason
for demonizing Trump so much is that it
gives cover to everything they do that's
evil
in other words they could say yeah maybe
we're not perfect but look how bad Trump
is aren't you glad you don't have him as
president so I never really thought
about that
way but they don't really have to sell
anything that they have as long as they
can sell Trump as worse it's sort of the
same technique that Trump used against
Hillary people said there's no way he
can be Hillary and I
said way do way do you find out what
people think of Hillary when he's done
with her
and that's pretty much how it went
uh so yeah I think there's something to
that as long as they're demonizing Trump
they can sell themselves in their
excesses as oh it's not as bad as
that so Ellen dtz was on Pierce Morgan
show and uh he was saying of the Trump
verdict it's the worst verdict in his 60
years of being in exactly this kind of
law in this space he said on a scale of
1 to 10 he would rated a
-20 now what's funny is that the panel
had uh David Pacman and uh a woman I
didn't recognize but clearly she was a
Democrat and and by the way I have
apologies to David Pacman and Dan Abrams
because the other day I was mocking uh
Dan Abrams but I mistakenly called him
David Pacman so this is the real David
Pacman I think I only saw his his photo
I didn't see him see the name on it but
if you if you watch it it's you can see
it floating around on social media but
you have to watch the the smug idiot
face the the msnb smug idiot face it
needs to be one word smug idiot because
they have a smile that says I know
what's going on here in the context of
actually not knowing what's going on
here and what I see it it's this whole
uncanny valley thing where it doesn't
look like a human to me and going what
is wrong with you what what is wrong
with your face why are you doing that
and so as
DTS who some would say might be the you
know Premier Dependable voice on this
topic he's just ripping apart the thing
that they all thought was you know
nobody's Above the Law and watching
their faces as they had to sit there and
listen to it they decided that their
best play was to smile like it's crazy
so they're doing
that the the smug idia smile is just
driving me crazy I don't
know you you definitely see Republicans
smile sometimes when people are saying
dumb stuff but they don't it's not like
the smug idiot it's a whole different
look and I think what it is is that the
smug idia face you can't produce unless
unless you realize you've been living in
an illusion there's something about it
that when you realize that you're the
one in the
illusion you you smile because there's a
disconnect between your reality and what
you thought it was which makes people
laugh and smile so I think the smug
idiot is is
smug not knowing what's true but also
finding out about it in real time and
you don't know how to deal with it you
like your brain doesn't how to deal with
finding out how wrong you are live TV
that's what I
think well meanwhile over in Gaza um
some say that there only 7,000 Hamas
Fighters left I saw Joel Pollock was
reporting on this and Breitbart and what
we know is that the leader of Hamas has
said they're going to reject any
ceasefire that would require them to
disarm so roughly half of them have been
killed if the estimates are true but you
know I wouldn't trust any estimates in
the war war zone so they say they have
7,000 armed hos Fighters and they're not
going to give up their they're not going
to disarm no matter what else is offered
to which I say well that's just a kill
me request so no now I think Israel has
the total green light to kill 100% of
the Hamas
Fighters so I think they should stop
when they have 100%
everyone and I wouldn't I wouldn't let
up until then
because the if killing half of them
didn't make a difference it's not about
changing their
minds killing the other half is the only
way you're going to get to something
good so if you stop now it would be a
complete waste of time everybody who
died would be a waste of wasted life
they'd all be wasted if you if you do a
ceasefire they have to kill every one of
them everyone like literally 100% And
and anything short of that would look
like stupid to me but I think they have
total uh ethical and moral cover for
that except for George Clooney's wife
the Wild
Card all right ladies and
[Music]
gentlemen
[Music]
um I can't agree with this pro-israel
stuff Tim says was that pro-
Israel did did what I say sounded
pro-israel it shouldn't have because I'm
not pro
Israel I I'm I'm just calling Ball's
strikes and observing I'm observing that
no matter who it is if the other side
says we want to kill you and we want to
keep our guns that only leaves you one
obvious choice you have to kill them all
now if that sounded like oh you're being
such an Israel supporter no I'm not I
don't support Israel because the uh the
ADL doesn't support me
and you don't need to tell me that they
don't work for Israel I don't give a
 that's not my problem but don't ask
me to be on the side of you know a
significant portion of them not on my
side so if they're on my side I'll be on
their side that's my deal I love
Jews did you see Mike
covich's post today she goes I think it
was
just uh I like
Jews just three words
he is the best uh
poster everything he says is just so
provocative no matter no matter what the
topic
is so I I will
uh I will uh boost that message I love
Jews I've had some of the best
relationships of my life with Jewish
Americans and Etc and even even you know
Jewish uh Israeli citizens I've had
great relationships
work relationships private romantic all
great so but Israel self no they're on
their own they're on their own because I
could only back the people who back me
so as a government they're on their own
but as the people people the people have
been largely great to me so of course
I'll be great back except for the ADL
the ADL is a garbage organization at
this
point all right
ladies and gentlemen that's all I have
for you today it's Friday I talked too
long already I'm going to say goodbye to
everybody on X uh yeah and Rumble and
YouTube I'll see you again here in the
morning for more fun and I'm going to
talk to the locals people privately
because they're special and I'm going
to wait a little bit for the feed to
catch up so it doesn't seem like I just
disappeared I will slowly sip some
coffee and then I will hit this
