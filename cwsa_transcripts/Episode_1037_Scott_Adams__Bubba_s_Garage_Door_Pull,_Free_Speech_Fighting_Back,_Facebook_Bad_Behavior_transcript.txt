hey everybody
come on in it's time
for coffee with scott adams i tried to
recreate from memory
the simultaneous sip preamble
i think i got most of it right but we're
going to try it in a moment
i hope you're prepared you know what you
need
think you do all you need is a cup of
margarita glass a canteen jogger flask a
goblet jealous
or stein a vessel of any kind it's not
the same as the usual
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
including systemic racism
it's called the simultaneous up and it
happens now go
don't you feel better already i know i
do
so let's talk about all the fun news
all right there's lots of it here's
here's a little uh news bit that you
probably completely missed
because the news likes to focus on the
important stuff
such as what is the exact shape of the
handle you use on your garage important
news like that
but one of the things you might have
missed is that the trump administration
won a big
court of victory about hospital price
transparency meaning that the hospital
has to tell you what
stuff costs before you go in so you can
do a little shopping
uh oh i forgot tankard yes a tanker
jealous
or stein yeah i think that's right
so put these three things together
you've got
this victory in the hospital price
transparency
so the trump administration is going to
allow you to shop
better or at least we hope that's where
it's going shop
better for price for hospitals that
should lower prices over time
the we also saw the change for
telehealth
where doctors can practice across state
lines
in theory if that becomes permanent and
they think it will
there's more chance than it will that it
won't
that should lower the cost of a doctor
visit
both for the doctor and for the patient
as well now i think there's something
going on
also with pharmaceutical costs
i'm not up on that but imagine if you
will
then november comes and trump can say
the following
we got you telehealth we got you
um hospital price transparency and we're
doing something on drug pricing
i don't know what that would be that's a
pretty good story
that's that's very different from i
didn't do anything about healthcare
it's very different so
that's good news let's talk about bubba
wallace of course
of course
so we learned yesterday that the fbi
looked into the issue of the
noose hanging in african-american driver
bubba wallace's garage bay
and the initial story was that
some were racist put that noose there
as a racist sign to the to the most
famous i think
african-american nascar driver but
here's the thing we just learned
first of all the noose had been there
for months before
before any of the garage bays had been
assigned
so the fbi has concluded with certainty
that it was not any kind of a racist
act against bubba wallace it is a noose
or at least it's shaped like a noose but
it's the rope that hangs down
that you pull the garage door closed
with
so yeah it's a noose but
it's it was put there for a purpose now
i have uh something to tell
my black uh audience today here's
something you might not know about
white people when we see a noose
we don't think race
when i see a noose i think a clint
eastwood
in haggam high i almost always think of
some kind of old western
where uh where bad white people are
being hung
so if you would say
and i think maybe bubba wallace might be
wondering this
because as he said after he learned that
it wasn't directed to him
and he agrees he said there's still a
noose
i mean still straight up it's a news
and i would only add to this that's
probably exactly what it was
meaning that whoever tied it thought oh
oh
you know i could tie it in a variety of
ways i'll tie it in the noose
but the thing you have to know is that i
don't think any white person
tying a rope into a noose it even
crosses their mind that there's a
any kind of racial element to that act
it just doesn't seem racial
it literally seems like an old western
where old white guys are getting hung
we we just don't connect the dots the
way the african-american community would
now maybe we should you know that's a
different question
i'm just saying we don't have i
personally
ever tied ropes into
into nooses yes
yes i have i have i've spent quite a bit
of my time
as a you know a young kid teenager when
i was like in
you know tying ropes and you know you'd
just be practicing different knots and
stuff
and you're a 12 year old kid of course
you're gonna try to make a noose
you know of course i learned how to do
it properly
because it was just something we saw on
tv all the time again having nothing to
do with race
because it was always you know bad
criminal white people
or being hung on tv
so here's what i'd say first of all
bubba wallace
is completely cleared in my opinion from
having
done anything wrong or even being wrong
because it turns out he never saw the
noose it was reported to him
by steve phelps who's the nascar
president
who came to him crying and i i assume
i'm just going to assume that the
president of nascar is a white guy
so the white guy comes to bubba and says
i got to talk to you in person and
he's the president of nascar he's crying
he's so disturbed
like genuinely disturbed and he tells
him about this
rope that looked like a noose etc
so bubba wallace never saw it he was he
was taking it from somebody who thought
he had interpreted
interpreted it correctly so i see
nothing in this
story which we should hold against bubba
wallace
everybody on board with that bubba
wallace gets a free
absolute free pass because he was acting
on what he was told
by a very credible source that just
turned out to be wrong
but it was a credible source can't hold
it against him for believing
a credible source you can't hold it
against him for
buying into a let's say a narrative
that is suggested by current events
because you know everybody's
thinking in race terms it wouldn't be a
surprise
would you be surprised one bit if some
race racist
somewhere did a racist thing in public
or to some public figure no it wouldn't
surprise you at all
because the temperature of the country
has been turned up so much so bubba
wallace
uh you get an a plus for
having nothing wrong you didn't do
anything wrong in this case
uh in fact but i will give i'll give him
one
one piece of advice the way bubba seems
to be treating this
is that um he knows he's going to be
mocked
for a hoax although the hoax was not his
doing and certainly not his intention
but he knows he'll be mocked for it in
his uh approach at least his initial
approach
was to you know act like it doesn't
bother him and
and channel that energy into his
competitiveness
now that's a good tv answer yeah i'm not
going to let it bother me i'll put it
into my sport
sounds good i mean you'd like your
athletes to say stuff like that
but let me give them some advice this is
the way i'd go with this
i would say
totally my bad so that's the first thing
you do you should do
you should do you know um it was my bad
even though i had
information that led me to this
conclusion i accept full responsibility
that's number one and then here's the
here's what he
i would recommend if i were advising him
for public relations
i'd say let's look on the positive side
look what happened
seriously look what happened he had
immediate complete support from
everybody in nascar and i would say that
the country was completely behind him
and i don't think there was much in the
way of
racial division there were lots of
people who thought the story was fake
from the jump including me uh
but we didn't really hold it you know we
didn't have uh
we didn't have a racial opinion about
that exactly we're sort of waiting for
the
waiting for the information to come out
we knew there was something wrong
but it didn't feel necessarily like a
racist thing maybe more like a mistake
like the oakland alleged nooses turned
out to be just
exercise equipment put there by an
african-american man
so um somebody says you saw a picture of
it
he did see a picture of it eventually
but i don't know if he saw a picture of
it at the time
and i know we didn't get a picture of it
so
there's that anyway so here's the point
uh i think you should look at the
positive
which is that the way people reacted was
the way you would want people to react
if it had been real
so i think his response was um
uh you know could have been better but
he wasn't being advised by a public
relations person so
he was just being a real person and i
hold that again do not hold that against
him
uh you think he or they will apologize
no i don't
no no no no i'm not saying that i i
think they will
apologize i'm telling you the way i
would handle it
if i wanted to commander this with the
best reputation
is i would go right at it directly
totally wrong
i was totally wrong but look at the
reaction
i mean you're missing you're burying the
lead you know the small part of the
story is that i was wrong
that's the small part of the story the
big part of the story
look how well people reacted to that
that's
that's how i would have played it all
right um
and by the way i do think it was a noose
and i do think it was tied to resemble a
noose
but like i say it was probably just done
by somebody who was
just tying knots um
did i hear that one of the three
presidential debates has been canceled
already because of
coronavirus and i ask you
is there any chance there will be any
presidential debates
what do you think because the first
one's cancelled and sure that could be
actually just legitimate health concerns
i mean why wouldn't there be
you know it'd be it'd be weird if you
didn't have health concerns about that
but don't you think all three are going
to get cancelled
because the biden team really needs them
to get cancelled
am i wrong that if joe biden goes into a
debate
it's it's going to be a bad situation
for him
i think they have to at least extend the
scare long enough to make the debates
not happen
that's got to be the key um trajectory
for
or at least the key strategy for victory
for biden
did you happen to see the god-awful
campaign ad that biden just put out in
which he's sitting
in this uh looks like he's behind
some kind of business and like an
alley-like
place where maybe there's some tables
that perhaps the employees smoke
cigarettes at
when they're not working it didn't even
look like it was a commercial place it
was
looked like he was in a back alley with
like six people with masks and he had
his mask on wrong and he's
falling asleep in his chair and saying a
few generic things
and i thought to myself compare that
because you know there were advisors
right this is a video that they chose to
release
that they filmed this the biden the
binding campaign itself
filmed it and they chose to release it
now when you see it you're going to say
to yourself are you telling me that
professional professional campaign
advisors thought it was a good idea to
do it there
the way it was done with just the sparse
crowd and this dingy
you know terrible optics
somebody thought was a good idea in the
first place then they filmed it and then
after they saw it they still thought it
was a good idea to make a commercial out
of it
does that is that feeling that right
now compare that if you will to what i
told you in the last
past month or so kabla harris seems to
have improved her messaging and
communication game
extraordinarily which is a strong
tell for some kind of a world class
advisor or more working with her
because you can see the transformation
and you don't get that from your sister
giving you advice
whatever happened with kamal harris
that's not from
you know your friend gave you some tips
that's from somebody operating at the
highest level
who's who's helping her transform and
she's succeeding
now i i had predicted years ago
when people said no she's not good
enough i said
just watch watch what happens when you
get close to election time and watch her
transform
because i i believe that she could um
she could learn skills quickly
that seems to be an indication that she
can and i think she did
so here's what we have we have allegedly
the world-class advisors for biden doing
the worst job i've ever seen
of campaign advisors so bad
that it almost looks intentional
at the same time his presumed
but not confirmed could could change but
presumably the vice presidential pick
who many of us believe would be the the
real shadow president
is getting the best advice you've ever
seen
is that a coincidence that all the good
advice is going to the number two spot
now it's possible that biden just
doesn't take advice
you see we don't know what's happening
behind the scenes but
if you are looking for a scenario in
which the number two pick
which i'm still guessing will be kabul
harris
becomes in voters minds the real number
one pick
this is maybe what it would look like it
would look like the number two pick is
getting all the good advice the number
one pick
is just sort of being pushed out there
so that's a little foreshadowing
there's something happening with free
speech
which is a fair statement which you
would all agree with
but maybe not you might not be seeing
what i'm seeing
so the first there's the surface obvious
thing
that free speech is being diminished
because
um well let me give you an example so
carpe dont got permanently banned
from twitter yesterday uh permanently
banned
now carpe duncan does the memes that
president trump
likes to tweet so so he's very strong
in terms of messaging for the republican
side
and he just he just got taken off the
board a few months before the election
now is that a coincidence
is it a coincidence that he's been
operating for years
but when we get close you know the
summer before the election
that he gets taken off the board because
he's not the only person being taken off
the board right
you're seeing some other people getting
picked off
probably not a coincidence now i don't
know about the details of why
i think it had to do with the the racist
baby um
meme that got taken down the president
tweeted it it alleged to show
a racist baby you know white baby
chasing a black one
but then you see it in its fullness and
you can see that they're best friends
and hugging each other
so there was something like a dmca
violation in other words the original
video
was copyrighted but it's a parody
it's an obvious parody and with an
obvious parody
usually the worst you'd expect is maybe
the tweet would have to be taken down
yeah maybe the tweet would have to be
taken down and that's
and that's it so it seems like there's
something a little extreme
also slate star codex got taken out by
the new york times
so slate star codex is a very uh
influential blog not political
but it may have had some content that
somebody didn't like
possibly uh he i don't know maybe he
talked about tds or something
so that got taken down he got doxed and
he took it down himself
basically so he deleted it the the
um pseudonominous what's the word
uh the blogger who does not use his real
name
took down his own blog when the new york
times decided to dox him
for no good reason all right so that's
happening
so you know that and you know that if
you say anything that somebody thinks is
a racist
dog whistle even if it isn't that you
will
you'll be canceled so that's the part
you know
you know that people are being canceled
and muffled and
muted in a variety of ways but here's
the part that i'm seeing
it has something to do with that that
has something to do with the black lives
matter
stuff for some people
and i seem to be one of them i have
increased
my free speech and i don't think you saw
that coming
for example i'm going to give you an
example of my newly increased
free speech black lives matter is a
racist
movement white privilege is a racist
statement and reparations is completely
racist
now could i have said that a month ago
maybe
if i really couched it just carefully
and
said it just right and all that
but for some reason i can say that now
and i feel like i couldn't say it a few
weeks ago
but the president keeps calling the
coronavirus
kung flu now he of course knows
that he's being called a racist for
calling it kung flu
because that's you know suggestive
of asian culture and therefore it's
racist
now even after he's told that
he keeps doing it it feels to me
that the president is very consciously
making sure that the field of what free
speech allows doesn't diminish
now i know his critics are going to say
no no he's just riling up the crowd with
racist dog whistles that's all there is
to it
we'll get rid of the give it arrest dude
fellow
there you go put you any misery
blocked and so
it makes me wonder if the republicans
are about to
discover a new form of
free speech or at least
simply just take it just just take free
speech
and just do it i watched a speech by uh
matt gates i guess he was probably
speeching either speaking before or
after the president at the same event
last night and matt gates said directly
the white privilege is is a racist
strategy to make white people shut up
and
and do what they're told and i thought
to myself
i don't know if he could have said that
a month ago could he
and did you know i looked at the home
pages of cnn and fox news
and i don't even think it's a headline
can you imagine that
there was a a you know a prominent
national politician who said in public
in a prepared speech
that the white privilege is a racist
term that's just being used to you know
manipulate race
white people basically i don't think he
could have said that a month ago
am i wrong i'd like to see in the
comments whether you think something is
changing
and it's changing in both directions at
the same time
which is that some people are getting
less free speech and being canceled
while there are other people who are
saying all right game on
which is what i'm saying i'm saying okay
bastards
game on if if if you want to bring more
attention to me
just just bring it on now
i think that part of the the the divide
is that what is it that um if you've
been watching matt gates for a while
what is it that matt gates and i would
have in common
i want to see if you can pick out what
is different
about the two of us from other
situations
now mostly we have things not in common
i would guess like if you
make a list you know here's here's a
list of all things about matt gates
here's a list about all things me be
mostly different
but there's one thing on those that list
that we're very similar on
that would tell you why we have a little
bit more free speech
i think than other people and i'm
waiting for the delay in the comments to
see if anybody gets it
um here's what we have in common
we're unusually good communicators
now if you are the side who's trying to
silence the other side
you don't want to give attention to
their best communicators
in other words if somebody goes after
matt gates and says hey matt gates
you said i can't believe you said this
that white privilege is actually a
racist
statement explain yourself
and then you know what you would do on
national television
he would explain himself so well that
whoever thought they were trying to trap
him
would say oh damn that didn't work
that did not work
he would he would take that accusation
ball it up and shove it so far back up
their asses
that they would never want to talk to
him again am i right
if you've watched him enough in public
you know that he's basically
untrappable on camera his his camera
skills are just
unworldly i mean i've never seen i can't
say i've never seen anything like it but
who would you compare his on camera
verbal skills to i don't know
i don't know it'd be tough he's kind of
all by himself at the moment
now i'm um for different reasons
you know i don't have the same type of
um
oratorical skills that he does but i'm
also unusually persuasive
and if i get mad i'm not going to back
down
sort of baked into my personality i
can't change that
so i would be the worst person to give
attention to
and i think that that might be you know
why i have a little extra free speech
maybe he'll come back and
bite me in the ass later so i think
you're going to see some kind of a
bounce back effect
where uh you know the president
and other prominent people are going to
say hey hey
how about this how about we say whatever
the we want
and you just shut up about it and just
listen
because we gave you free speech
we listen to you the the the thing
and let me say if i had to speculate
about why this is it would be this
what what would president trump matt
gates and i all have in common
specifically on the topic of george
floyd's
tragic death the one thing we all have
in common
and pretty much most of the world is
that we all have the same reaction to it
like this is horrible this is
this looks like a crime you know we
can't have this in our country
so i think it helped
that so many people were at least um
mentally on the same side with with the
people who would normally be our
critics if you know if you imagine it as
a political take sides
uh why is everybody saying flynn
flynn got the writ of mandamus well i
don't know what that
is but it sounds like something i need
to look up right now
fox news would have this right not yet
i guess it takes him a while to write
that up let's say uh
flynn news
let's see some flynn news dismiss
criminal case against michael flynn
appeals court really
appeals court orders judge to dismiss
criminal case
against michael flynn the decision
blocks us
sullivan from holding a hearing to
scrutinize the justice department's
decision well thank you
why in the world was justice sullivan
forming a new form of government to look
at his own decisions that never made
sense so that
so a judge has blocked that uh
all right do i understand what this
means though blocks you
from to dismiss the criminal case
does dismiss the criminal case mean it's
all gone
is that what's happening is that is the
case completely dismissing
well let's say it is
let's say it is let's say that the
general flynn
case is dismissed does that call for a
simultaneous sip
do any of you have any beverage left in
your vessel
grab it grab it
get your cup your mug your vessel
this will be a rare secondary
simultaneous sip this one to general
flynn
and all the people who fought for him
all the
people who advocated for him
justice drink
damn that feels good
that feels good somebody says carpe
dunctim who got banned from twitter
should join
locals he is on locals so
i'm on the locals platform which also
helps me to be a little bit less
cancelable because i
have a second place to go it's a
subscription subscription
service um i hope to be talking to carpe
soon about his uh account on locals
um and uh
know we'll we'll make a little bit more
noise about that so
you can see the importance of having an
uh a
a platform for people who get deep
platform to other places
all right well gosh that general flynn
stuff
how do the democrats process that if
you're a democrat and you're looking at
general flynn
the the case just got dropped for being
a complete fabrication and it's obvious
it's all part of this
the coup how do how do democrats process
that
i just don't know
all right here's some other things going
on
did you watch the project veritas
undercover tape of facebook employees
admitting perfectly candidly
and freely that they do illegally
meaning not not not compatible with
company standards
that they violate their own company
standards to
block trump's supporting messages
they actually sent it directly they
bragged about it they laughed about it
it's lots of people it's widespread and
it's so
it's so acceptable that the employees
were involved
saw no trouble at all speaking freely
about it in
in front of other people it wasn't even
something like a dirty little secret
that they kept to themselves
they happily talked about
suppressing conservative voices on
facebook
now that should be the end of facebook
in terms of an unregulated entity
shouldn't it
uh we'll see if that happens somebody's
asking me if locals
is app or web-based the app just came
out
a couple weeks ago so it is both app and
web-based
anyway so enough on that uh
facebook i think is gonna get regulated
um i think that twitter the
you know how brains work we associate
things even if they should not be
associated i
talk about this all the time the fact
that there's undercover
video of a social media platform
in which the employees are saying
straight up
you know we screw the republicans on our
platform
people will assume it's true at twitter
is that fair to say
so we do not have an undercover tape
showing
you know twitter people saying exactly
what the facebook people are saying
but your common sense says okay if it's
happening in one place
and it's so widespread it's got to be
happening in other places
it's just got to be so
i i think the possibility of the social
media platforms
not being regulated i don't know
i think it went to zero unless uh
congress is controlled by the democrats
so free speech will end actually
officially yeah
free speech will end on november 3rd if
um and by the way that's a really
powerful
statement isn't it free speech will
actually end on november 3rd
if democrats control congress and the
white house
because now that we know with with no
doubt
you know any any uncertainty has been
removed
that facebook is suppressing uh
speech on the right well you know the
democrats are not going to change that
because that works for them
so if democrats are not going to change
the social media from
suppressing voices on the right is it
not fair to say that
free speech will die on november 3rd
under the condition that democrats have
enough control
after that that's a fair statement isn't
it but it's also very
persuasive
because it's true if it weren't true it
wouldn't be persuasive
there's a rasmussen poll that says that
black americans are the demographic
group
most concerned about a shortage of
police officers
so of all the demographic groups the
black
black population of this country is the
most concerned about wait wait we're not
going to have enough police
is that a surprise shouldn't be
should that be a surprise no
nope it should not be a surprise um
i have a question for you why is it that
only republicans worry about mail-in
votes
being rigged i haven't tried to weigh in
on that question too much because
there are some um system details that i
don't know
and you would be it would be easy to
imagine that i understood this
mail-in ballot issue and i don't and i'm
not sure anybody does
let me let me state that more
emphatically
nobody understands the email and bout it
bell issue
it's a whole bunch of confused stuff
that we conflate together and
we treat one thing like a different
thing and so i don't think there's
anybody
who actually understands the real risk
but the thing i don't understand is why
only republicans are worried about it
because are republicans under the
oppression that there are no
local voting precincts in which
republican operatives would also
try to cheat with ballots i mean i
it feels like the cheating could be
about equal
why would one cheat more effectively
than another i don't know
so there's something about the whole
issue i don't understand
so uh let me say as clearly as a
possible that i'm not
agreeing with the republican position on
this
but i'm also not disagreeing i think if
you have certainty
on this issue either direction if you're
positive that
male ballots are safe you're not a
credible person
if you're positive that they're unsafe
all the way to the point of changing an
election result well i don't think
you're entirely credible there either
unless i learned a lot more about this
so when i say credible i don't mean
wrong
that i always make that distinction i'm
saying if you're if you're
trying to be an informed citizen then
you're just looking at what you know
and that's all you know is what you're
being told i wouldn't believe
either side republicans or democrats on
the topic
of male imbalance one of them is right
there's no doubt about that one of those
two sides is right
they're either a big problem at least a
risk
or they're not right i don't know which
one it is
i honestly don't if you sample both
sides of the media
you will hear arguments that you know if
you don't have your own knowledge about
the field and i don't
i hear the arguments and i go uh
sounds pretty strong and then i'll hear
the argument from the other side and
they'll say
sounds pretty strong somebody says don't
play dumb
don't you play dumb with me well no i'll
tell you what i do know
i do know that there should be
a million ways that you could
cheat with male in balance we'd all
agree with that right
there must be a million ways you could
try but
here's the argument on the other side um
you could audit them to know if there
was any cheating
so you could for example i don't know if
anybody will do this but let's say that
they suspected some cheating in some
area
they could say we're not going to check
every ballot it's too hard
but we can check every 100 or whatever
is the right number to get a sample
we'll check every 100 we'll go to the
actual voter and say
is this you show me your license did you
really cast a vote this way
and if the person says yes say okay well
we sampled a lot and everything we
sampled looked good
now if you sample and it doesn't look
good you would
you would have determined that there's
voter fraud absolutely
so here's here's the question
could voter fraud happen i think
obviously yes
would it be detected if it happened i
would say
obviously it could be obviously it could
be
now that doesn't mean that they'll have
a process in place to do that
and that's the part where you know very
quickly i get into the areas where i
don't understand it's like well
how many people are involved and haven't
we always had mail-in ballots i thought
we always had them
what what's really different about it is
it the fact there are so many but they
do have a
they've got an identifier in each one
can can china print up a bunch of extra
ones and if they did
how would china print up extra ones if
they need a unique identifier for each
person they're mailed to how could they
do that
so if you think you have a
a good firm opinion on this i would
suggest you probably
shouldn't um you know if i if i had to
now part of your intuition
is that it's very cheatable and i agree
with that my
intuition it is also that it's cheatable
and you could get away with it but i
don't know enough to confirm that
but if your instinct this is probably a
bad idea
you might not be wrong
all right here
is i sometimes i try to teach you joke
techniques
you know how to do humor better and i'm
going to read
a really funny tweet but it's only
because i want you to understand the
technique
so the technique here and i've told you
this before is putting things together
that don't quite fit
so here's a list of things
by deanna lorraine i guess you ran
against pelosi at one point and lost
so i don't know anything about her
except that she's a republican
and she tweeted this and i'm not saying
i agree with anything on the list okay
this is somebody else's tweet i'm just
reading it
bubba wallace isn't a victim sean king
isn't black
joe biden isn't winning cnn is cnn isn't
news
elizabeth warren isn't indian colin
kaepernick isn't a hero
beto o'rourke isn't latino don lemon
isn't a journalist
greta thundberg isn't a scientist meghan
markle isn't a princess
now i laughed for five minutes over that
now i'm not saying i agree with her
points
but the way they're organized is
hilarious especially with meghan markle
isn't a princess at the end
because that was such a throwaway just
nothing but an insult
that that that the whole thing
makes sense but it doesn't make sense
there there are too many things
that individually you'd have to think
about a little bit but because
they they don't fit together in a list
it just makes you a giggle
and i can't stop giggling when i look at
it not because i agree with it it's
simply the organization of the thoughts
um so this this technique of putting
a bunch of things together is hilarious
now
there there's also a persuasion
technique baked into this and it's a
little different from the laundry list
persuasion
laundry list persuasion is where you
don't have a strong
a strong reason for your argument so
instead of a strong argument
you you just list lots of weak ones
that's the laundry list persuasion
now lots of weak arguments that should
add up to nothing
because individually they're all they're
all nothing so if you add a bunch of
nothings together it should still be
nothing
but our brains don't hear it that way if
you hear a laundry list of reasons you
think to yourself well
you know i recognize that one of those
things on the list isn't true but
there's so many things on the list
there must be something on that list
that's true
what uh deanna lorraine did in her tweet
which was funny it's a different kind of
list yeah i'll call it a sean hannity
list
all right here's what a sean hannity
list is
for example there'll be five things on
the list
four of them are things that you know to
be true or
you're let's say you're politically
aligned with sean hannity so you're sure
they're true
even if they're not so the before things
you're pretty sure are true
and the fifth thing is sort of an
opiniony thing
and so if he gives you four things that
you know are true or you believe are
true
and then the fifth thing you're
undecided but it's in the list with all
those other things you believe
it's very persuasive all right
so so if you wanted to persuade somebody
that
some of these things were true let's say
you know some of them you'd agree with
right
we know now that bubba wallace isn't a
victim
but then she throws in shawn king isn't
black you know
you know what she's talking about
because he's criticized by the black
community for that
as well but is that exactly true
i mean i haven't checked his dna so it
feels like
i don't know joe biden isn't winning
well if you're a republican
maybe you think that cnn cnn isn't news
you agree
elizabeth warren isn't native american
you agree colin kaepernick isn't a hero
if you're a republican you agree better
better and then it gets
gets to that last one megan merkel isn't
a princess
by the time you get there it's just
silly but it's
it's funny anyway i just wanted to call
out the technique you don't have to
agree with any of the points
did you see the stephen colbert
interview
with john bolton
if you saw it there's a very interesting
phenomena that i can't determine
yes or no if this is true but i'll
but i will assert it as my strong
professional opinion
all right so this is professional
opinion
it would be hard to know if it's a fact
and
it's this you should look at my tweet in
which i showed the picture of
colbert and bolton uh side by side
and it's hard to show you things on the
screen here so well maybe
let's see and what i wanted you to see
is colbert's expression
compared to bolton's now it's a still
photograph and these
those can be really misleading because
if they catch you at a bad moment
the still photograph doesn't look
anything like the way you were
if you were moving but in this case the
still photograph
captured exactly what i did see when i
watched the live video
and that is there's a look on colbert's
face
which if you're a trained hypnotist and
you've seen if you've
triggered lots of people into cognitive
dissonance
there's a physical look and colbert has
it
the whole way through the interview i'm
going to try to teach you what the look
is like all right
let's do maybe i can show it to you
because if i don't show it to you won't
be nearly as powerful
so i'm going to call it up on the screen
here we'll do our best
let's see if the screen looks good on
your screen
let me make sure i don't have anything
else on my screen that's embarrassing
i don't think i do
so look at these two faces
now one of them is a disgruntled fired
employee
and one of them is experiencing
cognitive dissonance
bolton looks like a guy who's just you
know disgruntled employee
that is a completely normal look for a
guy who just isn't too happy
and he's expressing it colbert
look at his eyes and look at the smile
do you see they don't fit the look of
the eyes
is crazy and the smile doesn't fit the
eyes
that's cognitive dissonance
that's cognitive dissonance so
and let me see if i can do an impression
for you on here sorry for the people
listening to this you're going to miss
it i'll try to explain it
i'll i'll give you two looks one is me
um
concentrating on something that's right
in front of me
and then the second one will be um it
looks like i'm in the room but my mind
will be in a hallucination all right
so the first one is an ordinary person
who's not hallucinating
who's just looking at something in front
of them all right so look at my
expression
all right you can tell from my
expression that i'm present
i'm just yeah i'm just looking at you
nothing going on all right now now
imagine that i'm recounting
to your story of president trump who in
your mind
has has created this um imaginary he's
this imaginary monster
that's completely divorced from reality
now imagine that you've gone four years
knowing that he would destroy the
country but everything that can be
measured is better
now of course we took a hit with the
coronavirus etc but nobody would argue
that trump
did not preside over a strong economy
with good unemployment
nobody will argue that it's not going to
come back fast at least as a percentage
even though it might take us a while to
get back to the top
no one would argue that the stock market
is low nobody would argue that
isis still exists in terms of holding
territory
nobody would argue that we haven't
pulled down our troop
troop numbers i mean you could you could
just keep going
and the only thing they'd have is maybe
you ran up the national debt
which is not the strongest argument for
democrats because they would too
so imagine you're living in a world in
which
everything you believe about the world
four years has disproven it's disproven
after four years nothing went wrong
everything that you could measure when
right
so you have to actually hallucinate
something wrong which they do
they imagine that the president's inner
thoughts are wrong
so let me now do an impression of
somebody who's
in cognitive dissonance i'll take off my
glasses
and they're they're having a
hallucination while they're talking to
you it looks a little like this
and then and then the president that the
president
see the eyes when when the eyes are in
imagination mode and i'm imagining the
president as this crazy clown he's
running around he's
he's trying to kill everybody there's
there's a there's a look
and the and the smile will be
why am i smiling because i've got a
sociopath look
do you notice my my my eyes are not
smiling right
but i've got a smile it looks like a
sociopath
but the sociopath look
um the sociopath look
is very close to the cognitive
dissonance look
because i don't know what the sociopath
is thinking but the cognitive dissonance
is
you're having a hallucination and it's
coming through your face and your face
is distorted because it doesn't know how
to
how to deal with the hallucination now
you want the test
here's the test cnn's uh
let's say that think about all their
hosts
i'm gonna name names and now you've seen
the look right
so you saw it on colbert and you saw it
on me
and i'll go further and say that when
they're not talking about these topics
they don't have that look
it's about the topic that gives them the
look i'm going to name some hosts
from cnn and you tell me which one seems
to have a normal look
i'm just talking about the news this is
on the news this is what happened on the
news
and which one seems to have something
wrong with the eyes
all right all right i'll just name name
some
dr sanjay gupta just imagine
chris cuomo don lemon
anderson cooper um
jake tapper um
uh brooke um
why my brook baldwin um
all right now of those go
which which one of those people exhibits
you're all getting it right yeah
anderson cooper
anderson cooper has the cold bear face
uh chris cuomo
ish yeah i can see why you're guessing
but yes
uh stelter no jake tapper no
um don lemon no
believe it or not don lemon does not he
does not
um exhibit the cognitive
dissonance face which might mean that he
believes what he's saying
and it seems consistent with what he
sees could be
well this is going to freak you out
because now that you've seen it
and by the way you'd have to be a
trained hypnotist to recognize this
or at least be experienced but now that
i taught it to you you're going to start
seeing it and watch how easily you spot
it
now that you can see it it's going to
freak you out how easily you can spot it
all right let's see if i talked about
everything i want to talk about did i
miss anything
anything else happening and and let me
um
let me reiterate the the fact that
cognitive dissonance is not
does not measure your intelligence it
doesn't measure your
knowledge it doesn't even mention it
doesn't even measure your intentions
so there's nothing about anderson cooper
that i think is
anything but smart and well-intentioned
and well-informed
i would say all those things about him
but
it is nonetheless true that when he
talks about trump he gets a
look on his face that is not common to
any other reporting
and i think you've seen it somebody says
aoc
you know the ones that are hard to tell
are the are the ones who
um open their eyes wide when they talk
sometimes
so you'll get a photograph that looks
strange because you caught it right that
moment so cory booker
and aoc sometimes have photos or
wide-eyed
that's not exactly what i'm talking
about it's not just your eyes are wide
there's a there's like a glassy stair
like you're not in the room
that is the the tail
all right um
does anybody think that bolton is laying
a glove on trump
because it doesn't feel like it doesn't
that doesn't the bolton book
feel like it's just groundhog day and
it's another guy saying stuff happened
in the room and nobody else heard it and
in a month in a month
you won't even remember that book
somebody says no fair teaching nlp to
the uninitiated
so somebody is a hypnosis trainer on
here what's the next next
big red pill well if you were on the
locals platform
you would already know the answer to
that question
but because you answered if you're going
to stick around for a moment
i will read to you the parts of the red
pill because i
documented them on locals
so if you ordered it in writing that
would be the place to go
but i'm going to read it to you all
right so here's a list of things
that have changed um here's a
people are asking me if adam schiff has
the look see adam schiff has the same
problem he has
he has wide eye look and that
that one can throw you off so just
having you know wide eyes
doesn't necessarily mean cognitive
dissonance
um it's a little different than that all
right so
so i told you that the big red pill
coming was not going to be one event or
one thing it would be a bunch
of things here's the bunch of things in
my list number one experts are far less
reliable than we thought
and that changed a lot in 2020. yes or
no
the public's opinion of what experts
know and how much you should trust them
is completely different in 2020. are you
with me
that's part of the red pill just a small
part but all of these collectively
will make you doubt your ability to
understand your reality
the way you used to understand it number
one
we trust experts far less that's a
fairly new
change number two project veritas showed
us that facebook
literally is doing everything that
conservatives thought they were doing
it's real yes i will add this
flynn has been all the charges are
dropped
so the flynn thing is another part of
the red pill
number three we know that individual
scientific studies are no more reliable
than horoscopes
in fact half of published studies turn
out not to be true
now it is true that studies collectively
and over time
work science toward knowledge but if you
look at one study
doesn't matter what but usually in the
social sciences area
is what we're talking but if you looked
at one study
it's useless now you used to think well
it's a study
right even just a few years ago you said
well it's in the it's in the news and
it's a study
i know sometimes they're not real but
probably
80 chance is real and now you don't
think that do you
what do you think is the odds of any
study that's in the news
just an individual study that's not
backed up by other studies
and it's a shocking new claim what's
your first thought
about how likely it is true well it used
to be about eighty percent
right now a little closer to 20 isn't it
big difference um
how about uh we and now we know that of
course defund the police will never work
you know you already knew that but i
think other people are just learning
that the slogans like defund the police
don't translate into anything you can
actually do
you can of course improve the way they
do their job
you've learned that stories about nooses
and hate crimes are more likely
fake than real in fact the wall street
journal
did a study on we talked about a study
in which they looked at all the
hate crimes reported and two-thirds of
them were fake
two-thirds of hate crimes are fake do
you think it's two-thirds or higher
you think it's higher don't you that's
different
if you had said to me two years ago
there's a hate crime reported this or
that
is it true or false i would say well i
don't
have no way to know but 75-80 percent
chance is probably right what do you
think today
10 percent today if you see a hate crime
reported
and you haven't heard the details yet
you just heard
somebody's reporting a hate crime what's
the first thing you think
maybe it would be horrible if it were
true 10
chance is true that's part of your red
pill
how about this um we're starting to
understand
that if you calculated reparations
correctly there'd be a negative number
because if you if you do the right
calculation
you would study black people who came to
america against their will as slaves
compared to the income of the people who
were not taken as slaves
what's the average of the people from
the country or continent where they came
from
and how are the children of the people
who are taking the slaves doing
income wise now as soon as people
realize that
and a few people already are reparation
starts to go away
because even if you think there is a
different way to calculate it and of
course people will
people are not going to automatically
agree that i that i described it right
but the fact that that conversation is
guaranteed to happen
that it should be a negative number
pretty much takes it off the table
um how about the fact that we're very
close
we're not there to realizing that
there's no such thing as racists
what what did you did i just say that
there's no such thing as racists
what i mean is everybody's racist so
there's no such thing as oh that guy's a
racist
but you're not no no that's not a thing
because you can't be not racist in fact
you can't be not biased on any topic
because your brain is a pattern
recognition machine
but it's not good at it it's not good at
recognizing patterns it sees
confirmation
bias as a fact just as easily as it sees
the fact
is the effect so you can't turn off the
basic
working of a brain you can just find
ways to overcome it and
and ways to do better and use your
higher powers of reasoning to
recognize it and you know build a system
that tries to squeeze it out the bias
but it's it's now it borders on stupid
at this point you know 2020 it borders
on stupid
to imagine that they're racist and
non-racist that's not a thing
everybody everybody is racially biased
in one way or another it's just it's
universal and i think it's more it's
important that we understand that
because then you could work on the right
solution the wrong solution is trying to
fix the way
people's brains are wired
you can't fix the basic wiring of a
brain you can just fix what you do
which is fixable
we now understand or we're coming to
understand that the news business
isn't even trying to be news it's just
being naked advocacy
i don't think people knew that five
years ago people didn't know five years
ago that the news wasn't even attempting
to be news
i mean it wasn't even in their in their
first choice
uh we're learning that conservatives see
the news on both the left and the right
and so anybody who is only sampling the
news on one side
is a low information voter and because
the news on the left is sort of more
universal it always bleeds over into the
reporting on the right
the people on the right see the news on
the left and the news in the right
it's a fuller context even if they
choose to you know think one is more
right
so i think the left is about ready to
realize
that they are low information voters
because their own news sources are
completely corrupt
and they're just starting to figure that
out you know the flynn thing
the russia collusion thing this is these
little hints are starting to come
together
um the new york times is doxing that
anonymous blogger i told you so that
removes all doubt about the
press being on the side of the people
didn't you used to think that the press
was on the side of the people
you know maybe maybe you never thought
that but people did people thought that
the press was on the side of the people
the new york times has removed all doubt
by doxing a person that they were going
to write a
a positive article on
and they were still going to ruin his
life just because it's a story
and they were completely completely
transparent about that we know that
black lives matter is a racist movement
that is creating a preferred victim
class
now you probably thought that from the
beginning some of you did
and not everybody is there yet but
that's what's forming it's it's very
clear that a poor white kid who became a
poor white kid for no fault of his own
should not be put in the lower class of
victim
there's just no argument for it and i
think that red pill is
emerging we saw the russia collusion
hoax the charlotteville fine people oaks
and other hoaxes
you've learned that much of the news is
speculating about mutt
and mind reading once you understand
that the news is mostly mind reading but
poorly
you recognize it everywhere it's like
wait a minute that's not news that's you
imagining you know what somebody's
thinking
that's not a thing and now you see it
some of you have learned but not all of
you that hiring the best people
isn't really something you can do except
by luck
uh if you're the president and you
happen to be
a very provocative president who even
the people on your own team
don't necessarily want to work for you
because it's too much heat
you don't have a big pool to pick from
if you don't have a big pool of
candidates
the best you can do and this was true
with trump the best you can do
is take your best shot and then fire
aggressively
so if he fires aggressively and he's
picking from
a limited pool because just people don't
want to be associated
that's the best you can do people are
understanding that
slowly uh people are understanding
that if you hear a book or a report
about one person who was in the room
and heard something shocking but the
other people in the room didn't hear it
didn't happen right you used to think
well maybe it happened
but now you know that that anonymous
report or even the non-anonymous report
like bolton
nobody else heard it huh isn't that
funny
nobody else heard of that that means
it's not true
you're learning that disgruntled
employees always talk the same way
doesn't matter if trump fires them or
the ceo of a company fires them
that ceo has no strategy it's all chaos
everything he doesn't look into the
details he doesn't understand the finer
points
of all of the smart things i tell him
every employee
there's nothing political there's
nothing about trump
every disgruntled employee is that same
broken
record all right we've learned that
china is not our friend
and never wants to be it's not even
close so
decoupling is coming uh we're learning
that the
technologies we thought were the
greenest might be the worst
in other words nuclear power might be
the greenest of all
so that's a that's a switch we're
learning slowly that the planet
is probably warming even even skeptics
say the planet planet is warming
but there's a growing body of smart
people
michael sheldenberger for one i'll be
talking uh
about him a little bit more his great
new book is out
apocalypse never about three quarters
through it it's terrific
it's it's the best so let me recommend
this is michael schellenberger's brand
new book
uh apocalypse never and he goes through
all of the environmental arguments
but here's what's different he gives you
both sides
i don't think i've ever seen that before
like
quite objectively he actually gives you
both sides
and when you're done you'll have a
completely different
understanding of all of this stuff you
really will
it'll blow your mind uh
then there's uh just for a funny one i
said socialism only works if your mom
pays for your cell phone
so the the experiment in the autonomous
zone i think
has been very successful for everyone
except the people in the autonomous zone
because it told the world that what
they're asking for
isn't a real thing it's not something
that
can work oh somebody's telling me that
michael schellenberger's book
is not out until june 30th i got it i
got a preview copy
so but i'm sure you can pre-order it and
i think he would appreciate that
all right um
the lincoln project uh twitter account
yeah it's tweeting all the hoaxes
um let's see i'm just looking at your
at your uh jazz was sort of a mini
stanford prison experiment
well that's a that's a funny and
terrible thing to say
they offer one month free on locals i
think i have that option i was thinking
about doing that
you should link to amazon so you can get
a kickback you know
those are not very big kickbacks what
about parlor somebody says so parlor is
the um
one of the competitors to twitter but
you know it's tiny so if you do what i
do for a living
and you try to sell books and stuff you
have to be on the big platform so that's
not really an option
so it'd be very expensive for me to get
kicked off of twitter
but here's what i'd like to see can
somebody build this for me
if you'd like an idea for a project is
already something called
hootsuite hootsuite where you can
you can schedule your tweets and your
posts to social media
but i'm pretty sure that does not
include the alternate
sites such as parlor such as locals
such as rockfin competitor such as
bitshoot
i don't think it includes all those so
here's the product that needs to be
built
it's a product where you can write your
content
and uh and then you can just select all
the platforms
the big ones the small ones the
alternate ones which is more than
anything does right now
and it just sends it to all of them
because until you have the one software
that sends it to all of them it just
it'll be too hard
for people like me to to have a twitter
let's say presence but also have some
kind of a presence on an alternative
site all right
so right now there's not really there's
not a practical way
for somebody in my position to just say
uh i'm done with twitter
i'll go to this tiny platform that none
of you are seeing there no
you know the president doesn't use etc
but if i could publish to all of them
i would be sending all of my same
traffic to every source
maybe maybe the software has to adjust
it if it's being posted in a different
place
you know maybe twitter has a limitation
on characters but facebook doesn't
so you you know you'd have to have your
software tell you
you know where your content will fit so
yeah you can adjust it so if it's at all
but once you have that somebody says it
has been done
i doubt it all right um whenever i say
that something
needs to be built somebody uh always
says it has been done
but if you looked at that thing that
somebody says has been done it's just
never it's never the thing you know it's
just something that reminded you of it
um i would know about it by now
all right uh and if
yeah hootsuite is first of all the user
interface i found impossible
i actually i don't know if it's improved
since then but years ago i tried to use
hootsuite
and i found it so frustrating that it
was basically unusable
in my opinion and other people have had
the same opinion and whose suite does
not
um i think does not connect to the
alternative platforms
probably only does the big ones
um yeah if it's been done tweeted at me
and i'll take a look but i i will say
with the confidence of 99
that if it's been done it's not done to
a commercial level or it doesn't have
all the platforms or something
somebody says you can it's just not
simple like you want right it's the
simplicity which makes it a product
yeah other people are saying the same
about the user interface for
hootsuite pineapple on pizza i'm being
asked
i say whatever you want
social pee i don't know what that is
somebody joined parlor and likes it
oh somebody's asking me about tests
coronavirus tests versus hospitalization
so right now the hospitalizations are
are the at least the
coronavirus people have it is going up
while the
rate of death is going down and i don't
think we quite know why do we
it could be that the testing is finding
more people who have low symptoms
but that wouldn't tell you why the death
rate's going down
could be that the old people are hiding
better it could be
we know more about ventilators it could
be
who knows i don't know it could be that
some of the meds they're using are more
effective than we know
it could be the zinc who knows
but one possibility is that is that the
rest of the cases from this day forward
will be a lower version of death
it's possible slaughter meter right now
is at a hundred percent
uh the slaughter meter is not a
prediction because i always add this
following caveat if nothing changes
but something always changes so there
will be lots of surprises
between now and november 3rd do you have
any idea
how many people how many big things are
going to drop
between now and november 3rd a
um somebody says the fragile ones are
already dead they can't die again
i i think it's probably a whole bunch of
little things
that are adding up to it we're smarter
and all those things all right
um yeah biden obviously has some
cognitive problems
somebody says there's no zinc in the
vitamin isle at walmart
well i know i ordered some by mail and
it sure took a long time to get here
all right um did any celebrity die from
coronavirus yeah that's the test i've
been using to know how scared i should
be
because the odds of me being the first
um
like household name that that dies from
coronavirus is very small
so it's just this weird little trick i'm
playing with myself to say all right
if there's no other celebrity person
you've heard of who died of it
i know there have been a few but they
were ones i was not familiar with
then i'm not going to worry have you
watched the circus i have not
but i might all right that's all i got
for now and i will talk to you
later
