today we have a show oh my God it's
going to bend your brain possibly break
it if your brain is weak today I might
break it
but it's going to be fun all the way and
aren't you glad you're here for this
experience
that will be called this simultaneous up
and all you need for that is a cover a
mug or a glass of tanker tell us a Stein
a canteen jug of flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dope of
being here today the thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous
and don't you feel better already go
oh
so good
well let's jump into the news the
interesting stuff
uh prosecutors for the Alex Baldwin
shooting case where his prop manager or
whoever it was got a cinematographer I
guess
was killed and the prosecutors are
dropping the firearm enhancement part of
it
firearm enhancement now the purpose of
the firearm enhancement law
is if you do a crime without a gun well
that's bad
but if you bring a gun to a crime even
if you don't shoot it
you would get extra years for sure
just sort of guaranteed tacked on and
that could have been five years
now
um I Heard uh I saw on
on Twitter Jim Tomlinson was saying that
he has good lawyers
and that these good lawyers got this
firearm enhancement charge dropped to
which I say
I never even went to law school and I
could have gotten that dropped
yeah we're already private
well we're private now all right
um wouldn't that be the easiest thing to
drop is the firearm enhancement the
entire purpose of the firearm
enhancement thing is to discourage
criminals
from bringing a gun that has nothing to
do with making a movie that involves
some Firearms there there's just no
correlation between that charge and what
happened in this very specific weird
case
so am I wrong that I didn't go to law
school well I know that part is right
but I could have gotten that dropped I
would just say you know that law has
nothing to do with this situation you're
just going to be embarrassed if you
prosecuted on this and then the
prosecutors would say yeah we were just
throwing that in there for negotiating
all right we'll get rid of that that was
the easiest thing to get rid of
I saw a tweet today which I am skeptical
of
specifically because AI is now so good
at imitating people's voices
so if you remember yesterday I showed an
actual video of Anthony blinken just
talking and I asked people if they could
tell if it was real
or is it AI
and it was real as far as I know because
I got it from the news but
a lot of people said oh that's
definitely a fake couldn't tell
and now here's one that's also making me
question what I'm seeing and hearing so
uh James hersom tweeted a video which
purports to show President Biden giving
his talk that he gave recently about the
weather balloons
and purportedly
in a hot mic moment after Biden has
exited the stage and he's backstage
we here on the audio what seems to be
Biden saying quote you think any of
these guys bought that
foreign
followed by somebody saying totally
and then I couldn't make this out myself
but allegedly Biden says they'll buy
anything let's get out of here
so I I couldn't make that out in the
audio but
somebody says do you think that really
happened
that doesn't feel real does it
I'm gonna go yeah that's a little too on
the nose
two on the news
I'm gonna go with fake
preliminarily
now normally I say the government's
guilty until proven innocent but in this
world of where deep fakes are so easy
and you know how many I think I got
fooled even today with a fake video
like even today I got fooled with a
video that's from a different situation
than the one purported about the
earthquake and it's so easy to be fooled
by these videos I just I look at them I
go maybe but I'm not I'm not going to
make any decisions based on this being
true
is that fair
I think it might be it might be true but
I wouldn't make any decisions based on
it because it's just not credible enough
all right
um we continue to watch the antics of
Vivek ramaswamy
who uh is a republican leaning
um
let's say ex-ceo entrepreneur who's
saying a lot of things that the people
on the right like to hear
and he gave a tweet today that's
uh almost perfect
from a reading the room perspective
so when I say almost perfect that
doesn't mean it matches my personal
views it means he's really reading the
room well right so listen to this this
is physics tweet see if he's captured
what Republicans want to hear
he says uh quote end affirmative action
abandon climate religion
eight-year Sunset Clauses for
bureaucrats sure yes term limits make a
political expression the Civil Right ban
addictive social media under age 16.
declare independence from the CCP
Embrace fossil fuels and nuclear
decimate drug cartels do it without an
apology
good
what's your visceral reaction to that
yeah I think he's reading the room well
uh okay you're added me on decimate but
you know I was going to get there right
so here was my response he says he wants
to decimate the drug cartels decimate
means reduced by 10 percent
that's what the dec part of decimate
means it's 10. reduced by 10 now in
common
in common language
we've come to use it to be completely
obliterate but it really means 10
percent
um
I don't mean to be the uh picky person
but given that there's exactly one one
candidate for president
who said he would uh militarily
annihilate the the cartels and no one
else has said that
right and then the one person who looks
like he's saying it uses the word
decimate
which really means ten percent
now oh
yeah I'm aware that we're doing some
word thinking here totally aware of that
but
I can't get over the fact that it's only
the second person
who has said something tough about the
cartels and use the only word that
doesn't mean that
not the only word but uses a word that
literally doesn't mean that
I don't love this because one thing I am
sure of is that Vivek knows what the
word decimate actually means
it feels
Freudian
feels Freudian like maybe he didn't mean
completely destroyed
now that of course would be mind reading
right would that be mind reading on my
part absolutely
it would be so that's why I call it
speculation
if I said I can read his mind and he did
this because he really internally thinks
that would be crazy
I don't know what he thinks
that would be crazy so if you do mind
reading and you conclude that you know
what's in there
that's just crazy
and I call people out for that all the
time if you say I speculate there might
be two reasons why somebody would say
such a thing you know one is they mean
it the others there's you know some
other reason that's just speculating
speculating is fine I don't mind anybody
speculating
because if you label as speculation
you're not being a jerk and saying I
know what somebody's thinking in their
private thoughts that's just being sort
of a jerk really
so I'm gonna I'm gonna say that uh we
don't know what he means but I'd love uh
Clarity on that
because
it's my number one issue
Fentanyl
well here's the funniest story of the
day and if this doesn't make you laugh
nothing will
see CNN has decided that because Don
Lemon
said some things which are considered
misogynistic on air you all know those
stories
that he's being uh
according to Chris Licht or light I
don't know how to pronounce his last
name the head of CNN
uh that Don Lemon is getting quote
formal training
as well as well as continuing to listen
and learn
foreign
if you if you think anything is funnier
this week
then CNN sending Don Lemon to
re-education camp
you're wrong there's nothing funnier
than that
is the funniest thing
that is happening this week I'm sorry I
don't care what you think is the other
funniest thing you're wrong that is the
funniest thing that's happening
Don Lemon is being sent to
walk this re-education Camp by CNN and
this is after CNN's new leader says
we're you know you're you're too Lefty
biased and they're still sending them to
wokeness re-education camp
oh my goodness now at the same time this
is happening which could not be more
entertaining to me because he's going to
have to come back and and show you that
he's he's got to come back and when he's
on air he's going to have to prove to
you that the re-education worked
so what's he gonna say
how exactly is he going to prove that
all the re-education worked well ladies
and gentlemen I used to have a bad
opinion about women
older than the age of 45. but thanks to
re-education camp I believe that women
are more awesome than I am their entire
lives entire lives so I'm glad we
cleared that up
um
interestingly
I saw a tweet
um let's see
clay Travis had a tweet some other
people as well there's a video of Don
Lemon giving a little monologue from I
don't know how long ago
so prior to Trump and prior to whatever
happened to Don Lemon happening
and yeah is it 2013 all right it looks
about right based on his age and it
looks about 2013. so let's say that's
right
I'm getting multiple people saying that
because I've seen the video
in 2013 Don Lemon gave the best black
leadership
um presentation
that I've seen in America
since I don't know when
like
since uh you know since King basically
this is the best thing I've seen let me
tell you what he focused on you should
go see it yourself to see how well he
did it but he talked about
um I'd never heard this before but he
was talking about young black men who
wear their pants without the belt below
the butt
did you know that did you know that that
comes from prison culture
because in prisons they're not allowed
to have belts
well a lot of you knew that that's
interesting that's that's a little Gap
in my knowledge and that on top of that
now this is remember this is Don Lemon
explaining it remember he's gay
so when he explains this comes with you
know some Authority that I don't have
and he says that the ones wearing their
pants below their butt
are signaling that they're submissive
sexually in prison
and that people outside of prison are
adopting that style
and he's thinking maybe that's not the
best thing anybody ever did
now I don't know that the way you wear
your pants
is the top problem anywhere
but I am very sensitive to what I'd call
the Jordan Peterson theory that if you
don't get the little stuff right you
really don't have a chance with the big
stuff
and so where Jordan Peterson says if you
don't know where to start improving your
life clean up your room I hope um I hope
I'm capturing that thought correctly
which I totally agree with
you should start with whatever you can
control
and then control the hell out of it just
control everything you can control your
room your diet your Fitness you know
those things you could your who you
interact with to a large extent you can
totally control those things while you
learn your talent stack so control the
hell out of stuff you can control
so I agree with that so I think there's
something to it sort of the you know
broken windows causes crime which has
been debunked but I feel like the
psychology of it still has some validity
even though you don't see it in actual
crime stats my understanding is you
don't see it but the other things that
Don Lemon said was a big focus on school
so he basically said if you want to be
successful
here I'm paraphrasing if you want to be
successful and you're young and black
again I'm paraphrasing
for him
um
here here's how much money you'll make
if you drop out here's how much you'll
if you finish school here's how much if
you get a college education and see a
wildly different
so there's Don Lemon focusing on you
know presenting yourself in a way that
other people will respect you go to
school so you guaranteed you make money
and he even talked about littering
he said that this was this was amazing
just amazing amazingly positive so so
good he talked about how he lived in a
predominantly white neighborhoods and he
never saw anybody littering
now that's exaggeration of course but
then he was he was saying at the moment
he was living in a predominantly black
neighborhood and every day he sees
people just drop something on the
sidewalk
just drop it
and he says you just like that's no way
to succeed and I agree
I totally agree that as soon as you let
the little stuff be completely
unquestioned you don't have a chance
with the big stuff
that's just how our brains work
and then he focused on you know don't
have kids on a wedlock because it
destroys your chances for success or
lowers them quite a bit there are plenty
of people
who made Single Parenthood work you know
I don't want to I don't wanna
I don't want to take away from the
people who made that work because there
are plenty of them
but as a statistical truth it's hard to
question
so
it was honestly
honestly Don Don lemon's uh interview
there I thought was one of the most
productive and useful things and
probably one of the bravest
pieces of black leadership that I've
seen and I don't know how long long time
I mean I had a lot of respect for it so
I'm sad that we lost that and I'm sad
for the black community that they lost a
voice that was prominent and that right
he was that right he was right about
everything
so I don't know what broke him must have
been Trump
all right yesterday
um
I was
just playing around on YouTube
and YouTube
served up a recommendation of a video
and I don't know how old it is I'm sure
some of you have seen it but it was Joe
Rogan interviewing Bob Lazar
who claims to have been working on a
secret government project in which he
personally worked on UFOs that had been
captured by the government in top secret
operations he claimed that in his big
Warehouse wherever he was working one
day they left the connecting doors open
and he could see that there were nine
different UFOs that were all different
they had different models but they were
clearly not from this world
and he actually touched one and had like
some strange metal quality not found on
Earth and then he helped study it and
found materials not found on Earth
and I'll get to the debunking don't
worry
you should know me better you should
know me better but by now
do you think I'm going to leave the
debunking out and I'm just going to tell
the story and let it let it just sit
there
have you met me
you know this is a setup come on
so I'm watching this thing
and I got totally drawn in totally drawn
in I and I stayed up later than I wanted
to watch the whole thing
and let me tell you
it was convincing
um he did not look like he was lying
he had all kinds of details
and
when it was done I could barely sleep
and then I woke up and I thought you
know I should probably Google this
hahaha
it took about took about 30 seconds to
find out he was a total
totally non-believable character
so I don't know what's true and what
isn't true but let's just say he might
be the least credible person on this
topic so apparently his educational
credentials were totally made up now the
thing that the first thing that I caught
that was my first red flag
is I'm listening to it and he said that
you know through some interaction that I
forget
he was in his twenties
and was brought into work on you know
this top secret UFO thing
and I remember thinking because it was
one of the first things I saw when I
turned it on because I think it was
already running when I turned it up and
I thought to myself what are the odds
that you would bring in a scientist in
his twenties
for anything
for anything
yeah zero
I would never bring in if you had like
the mo If This Were true if we really
had captured UFOs if if we really did
you would never bring in a scientist in
his 20s
simply because they haven't seen enough
now I'm not saying that you're you're
best scientist in the world couldn't be
in their 20s Einstein right Einstein but
in the real world
where real people are hiring real
employees
they don't know they know they have any
Einsteins
right yeah and
there are plenty of great scientists who
did great things in their 20s no no
argument so I'm let's be clear I'm not
arguing that scientists in their 20s
are
less capable
I'm not arguing that I'm saying in the
real world nobody would hire one
it just would be very unusual
because you would want somebody who had
you know the The Sweet Spot of
experience which would probably be 30s
and 40s
baby 50s and 60s I don't want to sound
like uh Don Lemon I don't want to say
men men and women are you know not in
their Prime when they're in the 50s but
you know a scientist in their 50s has
seen a lot of stuff
somebody in their 50s has seen a lot of
stuff some of your 20s might be
excellent as science maybe even better
than anybody's ever been in science
but they haven't seen many hoaxes
that means a lot
somebody in their 50s has been fooled
and then you know learned they were
fooled a lot of times because that's how
science works you know you have a you
have a belief and then it gets debunked
you know through your own work
so
um anyway I will just point out what I
call the documentary effect as long as I
was looking at one presentation
which was Joe Rogan letting Bob Lazar
talk it was completely credible looking
the moment I spent 30 seconds literally
just 30 seconds Googling the person on
the show and their background and what
we do know about them versus what
they've claimed it completely falls
apart
I can't watch a man who finances his
water bed what
um
and Hot Pocket says in all caps maybe
you need to do a bit more research
no I don't
no I don't
I do not need to do a bit more research
if somebody says they're a scientist and
they're not
I'm kind of done
you know you have to make some decisions
about what you're going to research for
the rest of your life
but you end up using these rules of
thumb you know these little heuristics
here's my heuristic if a scientist makes
a scientific claim
and then we find out with great deal of
certainty that that person is not even a
scientist not even a scientist
I'm not going to do extra research on
the claim
is that okay with you
I'm going to use my rule of thumb and
say you know
maybe I'll spend some time researching
something else with my limited time on
this Earth
all right um
here's the newest hoax which I'm having
a terrific time making people squirm on
Twitter I recommend you do this all
right so here's the hoax
and I believe it's Oaks if somebody if I
get fact checked on this I'll change my
mind immediately it would be easy to
fact check you just give me one sentence
that can be confirmed and and I'm done
I'll just say you're right I take back
everything I said so it's very easy to
fact check me on this
and what I'm claiming is a hoax is that
the internal messages from Fox News that
the Dominion lawsuit surfaced that the
internal communication shows that any of
the hosts were intentionally lying on
the air
now the left believes that was proven
by the internal Communications
and so I say
could you show me the one example of
that you say there are lots of examples
but just just one
and what they do is they'll they'll
tweet you articles
and I'll say okay there's an article but
could you help me by taking out from
that article any one statement
that somebody said that you think they
don't believe and there's evidence of it
and then they say hahaha I guess you're
hypnotized or I guess you're a liar
to which I say no this is really easy
you're saying that the text messages
themselves which we've all seen
say that the hosts are lying
when they talk in public versus what
they say behind the scenes just show me
that sentence
just copy and paste it here's the
sentence and you saw for yourself that
they say something opposite in public
where's that sentence
and so what do they do
they tweet another article
that talks in generalities
and then I say but what's the sentence
what what is any one message
that you say back to your claim
it doesn't exist but watch how certain
they are that it exists it's hilarious
and then keep pushing them okay and the
one sentence is I even got so far into
this conversation that I had to give an
example of what a sentence would look
like
that just happened
I said the sentence would look like this
for example
Tucker claims X privately
but in public he said why
was that hard
that's not hard
the message says he believes this in
public he said this simple
nobody can do it do you know why they
can't do it
doesn't exist
they've come to believe that there's
something there that they've seen
with their own eyes
and when I asked him to go copy and
paste it the thing they saw with their
own eyes
they can't find it
they can only find other people who
believe they saw it with their own eyes
so all of their evidence is other people
who can't produce the evidence either
this is the damnedest thing but
hilarious so have fun with that if you
can find somebody that will commit to
that point of view the Fox News you know
showed their line
ask them for an example
I'm pretty sure there is none
all right
um
here's some fake news from CNN
so they tweeted today this is the quote
from the CNN's tweet they said quote
people who have had covid-19 have a
higher risk of developing diabetes and
that link seems to have persisted into
the Omicron era a new study finds
so if I were to read the study that
they're linking to and their article
about it do you think I would find
that people who've had covid have a
higher risk of developing diabetes and
that link seems to have persisted into
the Omicron era according to a new study
no
no that's not in that's not in the story
the the story says very much not that
here's what the story says we found a
correlation
but it's very likely the data is bad
that's what the story says the expert
says it's very likely that you know
there's something wrong with the data
that's in the story
like it says that directly the person
who's like very familiar and working on
the topic
says you know we can't trust the data
and then CNS says
that they have a higher risk that is not
demonstrated
there's only a correlation demonstrated
now it's a very bothersome correlation
but I don't really see the mechanism for
it do you
do you know
yeah so anyway given given that even the
people involved with it don't think the
data is reliable CNN acting as if
they've shown a correlation
is there you well they have shown a
correlation but they haven't shown a
causation
how many times has the news suggested
there's a causation when the article
they link to does not suggest that only
a correlation
like all the time that's how they turn
turn into news by acting like
it's more than it is just like the Fox
News internal tweets you have to treat
them like they're more than they are in
your headlines or else nobody clicks on
it
all right turkey had a another huge
earthquake 6.4 on the Richter
um
it's so bad there's something between 40
and 80 000 people died between the last
week or so between 40 and 80 000 people
do you think that's true I mean I don't
know don't even know how they count it
but you know I don't have much to say
about it
except that this is one of those few
cases
where you can do something that's
unambiguously good for your own country
and what would be unambiguously good for
the United States
in anybody who wanted turkey on their
side is to help
just help and not ask them for anything
in return
just help
right that that goes a long way
goes a long way and so I'm always in
favor of the U.S stepping up to help in
these big Global emergencies because
it's just good for us you know
um
there was a time was it in the
70s help me must have been the 80s yeah
it had to be the 80s
um
when there was some big correct me if
I'm wrong there was some big earthquake
in
Russia wasn't there
and there were a lot of
a lot of deaths and they needed some
help and I believe the U.S sent
immediately sent a major Aid to Russia
can somebody confirm that happened it
was around the 80s
I remember thinking to myself that if
you're sending major like help to a
country when it's in trouble
you should be friends with that country
like that the uh the Arc of history is
just like trying to push you together
it's trying to tell you to be friends
like take a hint
right we should be friends with Russia
now Putin's problem you know Putin's a
problem but the Russian people
and the Russian country
we should be friends
it's just crazy
like we just don't have a natural reason
to be enemies none no natural reason you
know you could you could imagine that
there's um you know let's say Islamic
countries or even Islamic you know
terrorist groups who you can't make
peace with because there's a fundamental
difference that can't be resolved
but we don't have any problems with
Russia except once we cause
or they Cause right you know because we
think we're responding to the other all
the time but it's just crazy
honestly peace with Russia
feels like the easiest thing we could do
and yet we treat it like it's the
hardest
feels like it's easiest now Putin might
be the entire problem here so maybe
there's nothing you can do while he's in
charge but certainly we should be
working toward the obvious now If This
Were Me
and probably Trump would do the same
thing
if I were in charge I'd be saying that
all the time
I'd be saying in the long run U.S and
Russia are going to be allies
it might not be during the time of Putin
but there's nothing that can stop it
from happening because we don't have a
reason to fight and we have all kinds of
reasons to get along
right the the only person who who's
benefiting maybe are the arms Industries
not the moment Putin you know Putin
might feel he has some benefits but not
counting Putin
I'd say we're just natural allies
because we should be talking in those
terms not not trying to because you want
you want to make sure that if Putin you
know gets serious about attacking the
United States
you want to think that their public has
already been primed to see the United
States as an ally
that would really help us and we should
be we should be
uh it's just hard at the moment
all right I'm going to give you a logic
test
so
um
I believe that this is the smartest
audience in all of politics but this
logic test will tell me for sure all
right so let's say there's a a question
of science
about whether a pill works or doesn't
work let's keep it simple just a
hypothetical so there's a pill
yeah this isn't the 25 thing that I'm
going a different direction so there's
there's no survey involved here no
survey involved just a logic question
all right and by the way this is one you
haven't seen
so you haven't seen this question before
um so it's a it's a question of whether
a pill works or doesn't work it's binary
it's a yes or no
so if you don't know anything
what are the odds
there's been no study
what are the odds
unknown right when when the odds are
unknown
but and there's absolutely nothing to
suggest which way you should go
I call it 50 50.
now the real odds are different but you
have to act on what you know
what you know
is you don't know anything
might work might not there are two
possibilities
50 50. now if you knew more things about
let's say who made the pill and you know
what the situation is that maybe you
could come up with some smarter
statistical prediction but let's say you
didn't know anything
except somebody who makes pills
has made one and they say we think it'll
work I say 50 50. all right now here's
where it gets interesting
there's a randomized controlled trial
it's a big one and everybody looks at it
and goes I don't see any problems with
it it gets peer-reviewed and published
now you've got a peer-reviewed
published
paper study
that indicates strongly that the pill
works
double blind yeah it's a randomized
controlled trial so it has all the right
things in it it's double-blied as the
number of people you know they set up
the test right it all looks good that's
that's why the peer review
published it because the on the surface
it all looks good
now
it's one paper only one paper but it's a
really good study now what are the odds
that the pill works
what are your new odds went from 50 50
when you literally knew nothing
now what is it when there's a randomized
controlled trial that says looks really
good
still 50 percent
because half of all studies turn out not
to be reproducible meaning they were not
valid
half
half
so having a randomized controlled trial
here's the part you have to see if you
can follow me on this we went from
knowing nothing whatsoever and saying
it's a coin flip 50 50. because I don't
know anything
then we knew a lot
then we went to know a lot a whole
randomized control trial where they did
everything right
on the surface
it's still a coin flip
it didn't change anything
it went from a coin flip to a coin flip
how many of you got that right how many
of you knew that it didn't change the
odds
the odds are exactly the same 50 50.
I just like this sink in for a little
while
okay
yeah and some of you are are squirming a
little bit and complaining but other
people are saying yes that's right
I think I did it right all right now let
me extend it a little bit now there's a
second trial
it's a randomized controlled trial and
it's different people you know and they
also do a good job and they reproduce
the study
now you've got two high quality studies
that agree what are the odds now that
the pill works
what would you say
I'm going to go with the locals comment
60 40. there's no way to know
but definitely it improves the odds
so if you say it goes to 60 40 I would
accept that I mean that's in the the
reasonable territory right you would be
just guessing at that point
uh and then let's say there are 10 more
studies and they all point in the same
direction
well then you have something you know
then you're up around you know 80 90
odds that you're in good shape
so I think we get that wrong all the
time
we're always seeking that a study tells
us something like the first one
and then suppose there's just one
randomized controlled trial but there
are a bunch of you know Meta Meta
studies and you know uh backward looking
studies retrospective studies and all
that and let's say you know that's part
of it I don't give them any weight
anymore
yeah at our current
um stage of science
I just sort of ignore them all and look
at the randomized control trial
all right
um here's your next logic question
let's say and this is not the case this
is a hypothetical
let's say Ivermectin was tested in a
randomized controlled trial
and let's say and again this is not
based on reality this is just what if
right we're in what if land what if
Ivermectin had been tested in a
randomized controlled trial and what if
they did the trial the way you want
which is they added the zinc and they
did it on time
which we haven't seen but let's say they
did it right let's say they did it right
in a way that even all of us would look
at it and say oh yeah they administered
it at the right amount and the right
time and with zinc they did everything
right
and let's say that the end of the trial
uh the placebo helped 30 percent of the
people or at least they said it did
and Ivermectin matched that
about 30 percent
what's your conclusion does Ivermectin
work or not work the placebo
uh reliably a placebo will be between 30
and 60 percent
so the placebo works for sure at 30
percent and ivory mechan shows about the
same 30 percent uh does Ivermectin work
logic question
this was a trick question
I only saw one right answer so far
um no don't say about known effects I'm
talking about the only thing you know is
the trial
all right here's the correct answer
the placebo healed 30 percent of the
people who took it
so even if it's a placebo
it works
the placebo effect is real
people really get better
they actually get better
so if if I've ever met them were making
thirty percent of the people better
for any reason even if it's
psychological even if there's no like
chemical activity at all
wouldn't you let the people take it
30 of them are going to get better
look how hard a question that was isn't
that interesting why was that a hard
question just just examine your own
thinking process and now remember the
question
I told you that 30 percent of the people
who took this pill were healed
why wouldn't you let people take a pill
that fixed 30 percent of the people
taking it
there's no question here because we all
agree there's no no risk of side effects
right the ivomechan's too well known you
know we we would know about the side
effects by now so
but
is anybody's mind spinning right now
that so many of you got that question
wrong
30 percent of the people were healed and
you said no that doesn't work
I just told you it works
and that and that in my situation it was
a hypothetical so you're not really
questioning the the the
it worked and you still wouldn't give it
to people
even though 30 of the people are healed
no I'm not spinning
what do you mean I'm spinning
are you am I spinning because you think
I'm either in favor or not in favor of
ivermectin this has nothing to do with
Ivermectin I just use that as an example
you could substitute any pill in this
case
the the pill was irrelevant it's just if
30 are getting better why wouldn't you
use it
now here's why I think Ivermectin
would have a stronger
placebo effect than other drugs
do you think anybody was in the the
Ivermectin trial who didn't have a
strong opinion of ivermectin
they all have a strong opinion it's not
like a random pill that you you never
heard of
probably the people in that trial
half of them were sure it was going to
work
if you take a pill that you know has no
side effects or nothing important that
we can find
and and you were totally sure it was
going to work
don't you think you would
more likely than not
yeah because the the mental healing we
don't know why but the the the thing
that people sometimes get wrong
is that the placebo effect they imagine
is only happening in somebody's head
that's wrong
their body is actually healing
did you know that
the placebo effect you could actually
check under a microscope check their
blood pressure check their blood work
they actually get better
it's not a case where they imagine they
got better you can test it they actually
got better
and and we would apparently we would
deny people a pill
that would make 30 percent of them
totally get better
because the placebo did the same thing
does that make any sense
if there were one time when you should
allow the placebo to do what it does it
would be Ivermectin but that apparently
has some legal ramifications right the
legal ramifications are if the
iverbectin works maybe the emergency
authorization can't be valid or
something for the vaccinations
so anyway everything about Ivermectin is
messed up but there's new randomized
controls uh trial that seems to indicate
it has no effect on
um covid
um what do you think the critics said in
five seconds
the test was designed to fail
I don't know maybe
I don't disagree with that I just
note that there is a study that confirms
the other randomized controlled trials I
think all of the rcts
correct me if I'm wrong I believe all of
the high quality studies say it doesn't
work
and and I will allow your criticism that
they were all designed incorrectly Maybe
but I think in the real world people
would wait seven days to take it but you
know you know I don't know I do think
they should have tested or you know as
prophylactically as possible
Merck is buying up Ivermectin companies
in India how could there be an
Ivermectin company you mean they just
make
um generics right so they're just buying
up generic companies
which would make sense
all right
um
Alex Berenson
is not a believer in Ivermectin and
believes that these Studies have
debunked it
does that surprise you
remember Alex Berenson is the one who's
going to be you know he's primed to
criticize the government and
you know big Pharma and all that
you would expect that he would be a
believer wouldn't you
would you but I re I respect the fact
that he's consistent about this I don't
know it's true
I don't know it's true
but I respect
I respect the fact that he's uh you know
he can do things which um would be
pro-mainstream and also things that are
anti-mainstream which is very good for
his credibility would you agree
that the ones I don't trust are the ones
who say everything the government and
Pharma said is wrong
I mean might be but doesn't sound likely
seems like they would give some right
just by accident just by chance so when
you see somebody who can be on both
sides of the mainstream
that's useful
so I'm going to give him a shout out for
I don't know if he's right
but his credibility is definitely
benefited there
all right
um
I saw a Stephen McIntyre tweet
that said uh fauci
canceled the various uh
tests for Ivermectin and
hydroxychloroquine and stuff when the
REM deserveer trial came in it looked
promising I think that was a phrase
fauci used looked promising and then he
canceled the other stuff
what do you think of that
wasn't REM Des fear wasn't there some
suggestion I don't know if it's proven
the fauci had some way to benefit from
that or some connection to the company
that makes it
there was some speculation that he
wasn't objective there
he has patents yeah I don't know the the
situation
but did REM deserveer change everything
isn't there still question of whether it
makes any difference
I mean the the latest I saw was that it
does
but it can't make that much difference
yeah I don't know if it matters or not
but we could say about Dr fauci if this
is true that he canceled those other
tests because of REM deserveer this is
either some uh good science saying
maybe if it turns out REM Desir does
work at least a little bit and it turned
out that all of these other things were
so obviously BS that they were a waste
of time then fauci would be a good
scientist who made a tough call that the
public didn't like but he got it right
and we're glad he did
possible
here's the other possibility
if you follow the money
it's possible that fauci is a mass
murderer and killed millions of people
who could have benefited from
alternative therapies by canceling them
for the one that would make him the most
money
those are both possible
I don't know which one's true
yeah now I I share your um
let's say conspiratorial thinking on
this that it's all about the money but I
will give you this one
rule of mind
if you follow the science you will be
misled
if you follow the money you will not
science has become just another way to
bamboozle the public
unfortunately
because science is so politicized at
this point you can't trust anything on
climate change or really anything on
on the covet I wouldn't trust any of it
I would trust science if it's a topic
that the public doesn't care about too
much you know a strictly technical topic
yeah I think science is good for that
but as soon as you enter the political
realm science is just a form of
disinformation
does anybody disagree
which is not to say they don't sometimes
get it right but how would you know
there would be so much wrong you
wouldn't know which ones were right like
the Ivermectin trials some of them are
right and some of them are wrong I don't
know which ones no way to tell so
science is largely useless as soon as it
intersects with politics but
money isn't
money works every time
if you follow the money you always find
out what the problem is it's just so
reliable now I won't say a hundred
percent I guess that's too far but maybe
95 percent of the time
yeah trust the science trust the science
is something liar say
that's what Liars say
a question uh you know that Biden went
to Ukraine and was hugging it out with
lenski he's given him more money and
um I guess Russia has declared that the
U.S is in as it is in a war with Russia
because apparently the U.S has greenlit
um attacks on Crimea
which Russia says is part of Russia
now
imagine this sorry Imagine This
imagine that Trump
had been president
and did anything that Biden is doing
with Ukraine anything any of it any part
of it
how in the world would we be okay with
that
we wouldn't be
our entire opinion of Ukraine is based
on the person who's over there
it's not based on Ukraine it's entirely
based on internal politics
all right I I'd like to slam some people
who desperately have it coming
right there there is a type of
politician that is starting to piss me
off
more than the typical Liars
DeSantis is one of them
and Matt Gates is another
and I like both of them
I like both of them
but here's what's pissing me off
so Matt Gates would be one of the most
vocal voices for defunding Ukraine
how many of you would like to defund the
Ukraine
the the war in Ukraine just like stop it
just stop it cold right now a lot of you
right
now I I sympathize with that position
and
um DeSantis
make some general statements about
Ukraine but nothing useful
and then then people say he's a genius
he's a genius he's not like Biden
but DeSantis doesn't say he would stop
funding
does he
so here's what I would like
if Matt Gates wants us to stop funding
he needs to describe what happens when
we do
because this is another one of those
vaccination questions where people just
look at one side and say I don't trust
the people who made them and so I'm done
that's what we're doing with Ukraine I
don't like giving them my money so
that's the end of my analysis
that's like a child's analysis
here here's what I want to say
I want to see Matt Gates or anybody who
wants to stop the funding which by the
way I'm very sympathetic with stopping
the funding
but I would never say such a thing
without adding the rest
and it looks like this I think we should
stop the funding I'm completely aware
that that means that Russia will take
over and Destroy Ukraine and execute all
their leaders that are our allies I'm
completely aware this will make America
look like a paper tiger and NATO looked
like a waste of money
I'm completely aware that this could
cause the domination of Russia
over Europe I'm completely aware that
Europe is dumb enough to reopen their
pipelines and become dependent on Russia
again
I'm okay with all of that I just don't
want to fund them
that's what the truth looks like
right now if if Matt Gates or anybody
else has a different opinion
let's hear it because maybe the opinion
is
um Europe will step up and fund it if we
leave
I don't believe that
I believe that without America they lose
but it's possible
it's possible I just don't see it I
think you would need an American
leadership for this to continue to be a
you know a military competition I don't
think it would be a competition without
that
um
is that fair
is it fair to say that the stop the
funding people have a a good argument so
far
but if they don't add what it looks like
without it
I mean it's Mass starvation
it's it's a holiday more too and I think
we would be responsible for it
you know accidentally I mean if we let
if we let Ukraine get into its current
situation
and then pull funding am I wrong that
it's Mass starvation
it would be that the second Holocaust
like thing in Ukraine in a hundred years
what do you mean please stop
please stop what
if I said something that isn't obvious
and true
please stop what
all right so if we gave them
humanitarian Aid
that that would be a good opinion
so let's say Matt Gates said let's stop
giving the military aid and go to
humanitarian Aid do you think it would
be much less
it's going to be a lot
you know the humanitarian late Aid could
last forever as well
Putin wants diplomacy I don't know maybe
I mean once he wants things his way
however he gets it
so but
um I didn't see any pushback on my point
that the people who want to stop funding
they have a responsibility to describe
what happens
anybody disagree
is there any disagreement
there is the spirit so let me give you
the strongest argument
for why we could just pull funding and
and just let them work it out the
strongest argument is it's just not our
country
but we did break it you know it's sort
of the uh
you break it you bought it
Theory we broke Ukraine because if we
had not been there the Russians would
already be in charge and
you know there would be some kind of
form of order
just the ukrainians would be very very
unhappy about it
yeah
well all right
um
what do you think about defending Taiwan
before we have to do that so Rasmussen
did a poll
and it says most voters are willing to
commit U.S naval and air power to defend
Taiwan
um
79 percent of likely us voters would
support the U.S imposing economic
sanctions on China if they invaded
Taiwan
and that's a lot but that's economic
um
let's say but there's PL there are
plenty of people
who would be pleased for the U.S to get
into a military conflict with China over
Taiwan
now here's my Taiwan opinion
Taiwan is going to be part of China
sorry
and
I think that geography is just too
important
it's just too important
project genitis
uh
yeah now I don't have a better idea
if if Taiwan you know lost its its
system to China I would feel very bad
for her for Taiwan I would feel like the
U.S let down an ally we would lose
access to their technology and their
production and their chips it would be
terrible for the U.S
but it's going to happen anyway
that's my take if something's going to
happen anyway
you should just figure out the best way
to
you know get past it and I don't know if
a war is the best way
so all right let's move on
um
I tweeted this I don't want to get into
the details of this but it just it's
just amazing
I tweeted this if it if you ever
wondered how powerful brainwashing is
consider that the media convinced half
of the country
that we once had a president who called
neo-nazi's Fine people in public
and that he recommended drinking bleach
for covet
in public
half in the country believes those two
things actually happened
now I've spent you know countless hours
debunking those things and and other
hoaxes but
I would like to call on a better
like a better method than going into all
the detail
how about this
if you really believed that a president
of the United States
in public
with plenty of warning so it didn't like
slip out he knew exactly what he was
saying prepared his comments and then
called neo-nazi's Fine people
there's something wrong with your brain
you should know without any research
whatsoever that that didn't happen
and then let's say you hear that a
president
recommended drinking bleach
you shouldn't have to do research to
know that didn't happen
right
I didn't have to do research to know
that my government did not shoot down
UFOs
I didn't have to research that
right
it's sort of obvious
right on the surface
all right um so let's get to another
hoax the January 6th hoax which half of
the country has been brainwashed into
thinking was an insurrection
once again do you need to do research
to know that Republicans
don't stage an Insurrection without
weapons
did you really need to research that
because if you did
you're really stupid
you're really stupid if you think that
was an Insurrection without weapons
now I know what people when I bring this
up people go oh but there were weapons
okay so you believe that
they brought them but didn't use them
for their Insurrection is still stupid
you can't get to smart with that opinion
you can't get there it's just stupid
and we shouldn't have to explain it to
anybody
like at some point you just have to
shake your heads and say
seriously
you believe that
now is there a is there a
let's say a right-leading version of
that
is there anything that Republicans
believe
that you shouldn't have to even research
it it's just sort of obviously not true
anything like that
can you think of any
well depopulation I don't know
oh I'm sorry yes the depopulation one
right yeah that's a good example
if you actually believe that the world
economic Forum wants to reduce the
population
of Earth
from its current level actually to have
fewer people of the future if you
believe that
you shouldn't have to research to know
that that's not true
that shouldn't require any research
to know that that's not true
all right
um so uh
so I guess speaker McCarthy is releasing
over 40 000 hours of video footage from
January 6 from
the various security cameras I guess and
it's stuff that nobody's well nobody on
the right is seen apparently but but
it's released to Tucker Carlson and his
producers and so they're going to spend
the week going through it I guess and
then next week they'll tell us what
uh Tucker teases that they've already
seen something that directly contradicts
the official narrative
um as others have noted
um do we have to wonder what we're going
to see
do you have to wait to see the video to
know what it's going to show you
you don't have to wonder
let me tell you exactly what you're
going to see
if it's on Tucker Carlson show it will
show you that um
that it wasn't the Insurrection you
thought and that maybe somebody opened
the doors for him and they just walked
in
am I right
it will definitely show that even if it
didn't happen it will show that
because that's what you want to see
now when the uh when the Democrats look
at all the same footage
because they'll look at whatever is
released
do you think they're going to see what
uh what you see or what Tucker says you
should see now they're going to look at
exactly the same footage and say I don't
see it
and then you're going to say well it's
right there
and then they're going to say where
you say right there it's right there
look at this look at this look at this
and then they're going to say I'm
looking at it
I don't see what you see
who's going to be right
who will be right
nobody
because whatever you see from Tucker
will be out of context
and we won't know anything
I wouldn't trust anything I saw on video
on the news it's 2023. if you would
trust anything you see on video on the
news I would suggest that that's a
gullible position in 2023. it doesn't
matter who who produces it doesn't
matter if it's project Veritas or CNN it
doesn't matter
because even when people don't intend to
fool you
they're still in their little bubble and
so when they put together what you need
to know it's not going to be unbiased
it's going to be biased so you can
guarantee that Republicans will see
whatever they expect to see you can
guarantee that the Democrats will say we
don't see it we're looking at the same
stuff you are don't see it or it doesn't
matter or it's in a context or something
so there's nothing really going to learn
from this
that's my prediction
my prediction is you will learn nothing
what do you think
I mean it might
it might strengthen whatever beliefs you
already have but it's not going to
change anybody's Minds about anything
all right I hope I'm wrong here's what
representative Jamie Raskin Democrat
says about all this he says McCarthy
giving 40 000 hours of January 6 tape to
pro-putin journalist
that's Tucker
he's calling him a pro Putin
journalist is an astounding ethical
collapse once security precautions were
taken to keep this uh from becoming a
road map for 2024 insurrection
why isn't it available to all media and
public smell the Maga propaganda coming
well uh Raskin has first of all a good
point
if the only place is released to is
Tucker Carlson I do not trust the
reporting on it
is that fair
and not because I don't trust Tucker
is because the situation is blatantly
ridiculous
blatantly ridiculous
it's ridiculous I don't favor this at
all
either either release it to everybody
or just admit it's a propaganda
it's a propaganda exercise
so as it is I wouldn't believe anything
that Tucker reports
and I trust Tucker
I actually have a good opinion of Tucker
but the setup
it wouldn't matter if it's Tucker or
anybody else
it wouldn't matter who it is the setup
is you should not trust it
so I will feel very disappointed in
anybody who trusts anything that comes
out of that reporting
if everybody got to see it so there was
a Counterpoint if there is one maybe
Maybe
yeah I I did not say Tucker's a liar did
I let's be clear did I say tucker is a
liar no
no
I've not seen any evidence to support
that not in any other situation as well
no I'm saying that if people who have a
certain worldview are deciding what you
can see and what you don't see
don't trust it it wouldn't matter who it
was
it's irrelevant to the personality my
point has nothing to do with Tucker
as long as it's just one person on one
side I don't trust it
neither should you but neither do I
trust Jamie Raskin for saying that
Tucker is pro-putin the evidence for
that would be
nothing
so what do you say that somebody is pro
not being at war with Russia
that's not exactly pro-putin is it
I don't know anybody who's pro-putin
literally nobody in America
nobody I only know people who don't want
to be in a war with Russia
so to go from
uh well it's just disgusting when a an
elected representative goes full
McCarthyism
no pun intended
and labels a prominent member of the
press and an important one one of the
most important I would say in top ten
for sure
labeling that person a pro Putin I mean
that that is an ethical
collapse
that is just disgusting
like I I actually had a feeling of
revulsion when I read it
like not just this is wrong or something
like like revolted I mean like it makes
me sick that I live in a country with
somebody like representative JB Raskin
and
it's just such a terrible thing for an
elected official to say about a citizen
you know I get that Tucker is a public
figure right he gives as good as he gets
right so yeah he can take a punch
but still
he wasn't an elected official you know
Tucker is somebody trying to give you
the news and an opinion and I'm not okay
with that I'm just not okay with that
and it wouldn't matter if Trump said it
or republican said it I'm not okay with
it you can't be calling American
citizens uh pro-putin or any words to
that effect unless you've got some
receipts
and I'm pretty sure there's nothing Pro
Putin in anything Tucker's ever said
you Pro not being at war with Russia yes
you think Tucker is getting paid
really
I don't know
he seems a little bit unbribable I don't
know what his income is
but as some income level you're kind of
unbriable aren't you
like I feel I'm unbriable
what kind of bribe would I take
when people accuse me of like being on
the payroll or something
how would that ever make sense if you're
already rich
do people who are already rich take
bribes
I don't know why you would now if
somebody offered me like a billion
dollars you know that I then then I will
tell you well you know maybe that would
influence me but who could offer me like
enough money
that somehow would be under the radar
and would make some difference to me
that I would sell out my soul
you think I'm going to sell out my soul
for a little extra money
that wouldn't make any sense would you
you know if you had enough money to be
comfortable and you just didn't need it
anymore
would you take a bribe
you'd sell your soul for a little extra
money that you don't need at all
like is your soul worth nothing
like I'd like to think my soul has some
value
and I can't imagine what I would sell it
for but you know less than a billion
wouldn't get it done
I suppose that means I'm unethical
because I'd go for a billion I don't
know if I'd go for a billion it would
depend on the I suppose it would depend
depend how bad the lie was I wouldn't
tell a bad lie for a billion dollars
uh but I might like you could you can
imagine convincing yourself well if I
had the billion it's not such a bad lie
and I could use that billion for good
you know you could talk yourself into it
but uh I'd like to think I would resist
um
all right
so uh Russia
and Ukraine
uh I'm following an account I mentioned
it before and I don't know who to
believe you know I think we can all
agree you don't believe anything that
comes from Ukraine or the pundits or
from Russia it's all unreliable but I'm
following a thread
that purports to
think that Russia is running out of ammo
now the counterclaim is they can't run
out of ammo they make ammo they'll just
make as much as they need
but the counter to the counter is that
you're thinking of the Soviet Union
this is the first time I've heard this I
don't know if it's true so consider this
something to be fact checked the claim
is that the Soviet Union was in fact
able to make tons of ammo because they
had the manufacturing to do that but
that Russia doesn't have the same
industry
and that they actually have a smallish
ammo making industry and that they're
using more than their industry can make
so if they don't buy it from other
countries which they're desperately
trying to do
they're they just can't make enough
they'll just run out basically
so
does that sound believable
what does seem to be believable is that
Russia is trying to get ammo wherever
they can
and they're trying to get really old
ammo that's been in you know Africa and
other countries for a long time do you
think they would try so hard
to buy ammo from all these sketchy
sources if they could make as much as
they needed
yeah it doesn't feel like
they would do that now I suppose you
know if if they're one place they made
ammo got
destroyed accidentally accidentally
um you know maybe they think they need
to diversify their Source just in case
they're domestic manufacturer goes down
for some reason
but it feels like desperation
can't know for sure
but they seem to be going so far out of
field to get ammo is suggests there's a
problem
now the ukrainians
um it is suggested not by me but by
people who purport to know more than I
do
that the ukrainians will be in better
shape with ammo
because they have so many backers or you
know we we have manufacturing as well
so I don't know if to believe that or
not
but I think one of the story lines is
that Russia just will run out of assets
because their artillery barrels are
melting
this is something else I didn't know
until recently did you know that
artillery guns wear out
you can only shoot them for so long you
have to change the whole Barrel
and and if you're in a hot or you can't
really change barrels like it's just too
hard to get you know the base back to
the factory refitted then back to the
war zone just too hard
so
they may be running out of artillery
because the ukrainians have more
accurate stuff
they can be cleaned but apparently
there's there's a melting that happens
too
all right here we I was waiting for the
NPC idiots all right idiot number one
I'm just going to call out all the
idiots oh my OMG Scott has only got one
lens to look through now this is after
you heard me say that it's all
undependable
and you you couldn't understand that
concept was that too difficult for you
let's see let's just call it the rest of
the idiots
um
I just want to call out the idiots who
think that uh I only looking through one
lens he's only got one eye
anybody else
because it's the stupidest comment I
just want to see how many of you want to
volunteer to be idiots in public go
ahead
all right
um
anyway so we don't believe that but who
knows
all right so uh Putin says he's going to
suspend participation in the new start
treaty which would be about nukes
um
does that make any difference
well I thought Putin was violating all
the nuke agreements anyway
I don't know I thought it made no
difference yeah probably no difference
Barrel changes are planned they're
planned but they're pretty difficult
yeah I'm not saying that they wouldn't
be able to change some barrels I'm just
saying that in the war zones could be
pretty tough
um
keeps it off the market yeah
all right
um
and I'd like to end on something that I
know will be a crowd pleaser
uh today I realized I'm an
um I'll give you the specifics but do
you ever go through life thinking I'm a
pretty good person
I'm a pretty good person
I did some good things today I helped
some people I paid my taxes I saw some
litter on the street
I picked it up nobody was even watching
yeah I recycle
I recycle better than you do I recycle
more than you do I'm better than you
yeah that was that was the feeling I had
about myself until this morning
and then I realized
I have a thing called a a luxury opinion
do you know what a luxury opinion is
a luxury opinion is something that
doesn't make a lot of sense
but it makes you feel good and look good
for having that opinion
here's my luxury opinion
we should stop funding the war in
Ukraine
that's an opinion that's a total
 opinion why I just told you
because I didn't tell you what would
happen if we stopped funding them
right if I if I leave out what is the
downside of doing I'm just an
who's trying to look good by saying I
don't want to fund a war
that was my realization about myself I
was like Jesus
seriously by the way this is an honest
opinion I'm not joking I actually had
this opinion about myself I was like
I'm just an
I'm a total
right
you agree if I want to stop the war
because it sounds good it's sort of like
being in favor of climate change without
understanding anything about the
implications of getting rid of fossil
fuel that's a luxury opinion oh yeah
right
you it's just a total opinion
I don't know every once in a while you
have to examine yourself and say are any
of my opinions luxury opinions
where they just sort of sound good when
you say I'm in public but you can't back
it up at all I can't back that opinion
up I totally cannot back that opinion up
but I have it
I have that opinion I just can't back it
up
all right
um I knew that would be a crowd pleaser
Scotty is a neocon no I'm the opposite
of a neocon
I I would definitely press for
negotiations but
anyway uh if anybody asks I'll have that
luxury opinion oh yeah I'm in favor of
not funding Wars because I'm a good
person I'm a good person that's why
not just an
um
all right
oh there's a long paragraph there
all right everybody that concludes my
prepared remarks
um
was any of this fun
did you enjoy today's live stream
so I'm saying no
I don't like your Ivory mechan opinions
I don't like your Ukraine opinions damn
it
did you finance your water bed what is
this about a waterbed
Dave Smith owns me
Dave Smith doesn't even know my opinion
ask Dave Smith what my opinion is
if he can even describe my opinion
I will be amazed
I'd be amazed
there are still some people who don't
know that 4chan played a hoax on all of
you about my opinions of the pandemic
you know that's all a hoax on you right
Ben Garrison people they were all hoaxed
all right
um
Erica
are you hypnotizing your audience
not consciously
what do I think of Peter zahan
every time I hear Peter Zan talk uh it
scares me to death
because he has some scary opinions about
the future
but
um
he's speculating like a lot of us I I
don't know what his track record is I
like his opinions that when when he
shows his opinions he shows his he shows
his work
so I I appreciate that it doesn't mean
he's always right but he shows his work
that's as good as you can do
all right
um
just uh
Zayn has been wrong forever
has he ever been right
his suits thread what's that
Nunya says you have no opinions you
fence it and work in probabilities of
outcomes so you can backtrack
what do you think of that here's the
dumbest opinion of the day
all right so none of your business says
about me you have no opinions you fence
it and work in probabilities of outcomes
so you can backtrack
if you don't think in probabilities
you don't have a functioning brain
you know that right
am I telling you this for the first time
I hate to break it to you
but if you're not thinking exactly the
way you're criticizing me for thinking
you need
um
probably to be institutionalized
because that sounds like serious mental
illness if you think that you have
certainty about the future
that would be mental illness
but if you say well there's an 80 chance
this happens but then it doesn't happen
you say well
um I said 80 chance but there was a 20
chance it wouldn't happen
and you think that that's bad thinking
you should really get some professional
help
only siths deal in absolutes thank you
only siths
you read about me and your business
management course in college I hope it
was positive
um I make God laugh tell them your plans
I like that
um Biden is pretending to be senile
Maybe
uh
all right
tried to protect your next words
I'm better than cats thank you
um all right
all right YouTube that's all for now I'm
gonna go talk to the locals group of
privately but thanks for joining and I
will talk to you tomorrow
