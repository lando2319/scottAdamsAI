[Music]
hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time for a
coffee with scott adams
definitely the best part of the day i
know it is for me
that's actually true i like this hour we
spend together
better than most parts of my day i gotta
say
and the only thing that could make it
even better would be the simultaneous
sip
that's right then all you need is a
copper margaret glass a
tanker chalice or stein a canteen joker
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous step when
it happens now
go
hello northern colorado good to have you
in the house
so it seems to me that it's a little bit
slow in the news department today
and when i say it's slow in the news
department i mean
too slow i mean suspiciously slow
i mean there's something brewing
something's gonna happen today maybe
tomorrow
but there's some big stuff coming
there always is so that's an easy
prediction
um so here's
some of my favorite stories of the day
one of the things
that endears trump to his base
is he says out loud the things you're
not supposed to say out loud
and i may have taught you at one point
that a really good technique for
persuasion
is to say out loud what you know
somebody is thinking
but they have not yet said it and if you
get it right
it forms this little bond and you go oh
yeah when you think things
same thing i think it just connects
people instantly it's one of the most
powerful
persuasion techniques i have ever used
and the president didn't hear with
what did you think the first time you
heard
that ruth bader ginsburg's deathbed wish
had been translated i guess to a
daughter
and said there was her fervent desire
that
her replacement was picked by the next
president
now when you saw that
was there any part of your brain
that said i don't know if she really
said that
because it would be pretty easy for the
family to make something up if you know
what i mean
and who knows how coherent she was in
her
last hours of life so the president
actually called bs on it on his
interview i think he was on fox and
friends this morning
and he said quote i don't know that she
said that
was that written out by adam schiff
schumer and pelosi
now i don't think that they wrote it out
but the fact that he called the
to it
now i'm not saying it is
because
it's entirely compatible with things she
said before
it's entirely compatible with what could
have happened
but didn't you wonder a little bit
you wondered you know you did you
wondered if she really said that
and when you hear trump say it out loud
you just say to yourself
okay there you go he's thinking what i'm
thinking
i feel comfortable with that
now i think he was just you know
stirring the pot a little bit there
i don't think he necessarily believes
that she didn't say it
but it's something you could be
skeptical about i think a reasonable
person could be skeptical about that
um did you see the weird pelosi
interview with stepanopolis
stephanopoulos um you can see it in my
twitter feed and anywhere else just
google stefanophilus and pelosi
and it looked like she went crazy or
her brain rebooted or something but
that's not what happened what happened
was she tried to make a joke
but she didn't land it it was just
awkward and so since you couldn't tell
it was a joke
you didn't know what it was and what
happened was
stefano stepanovis asked her about
what weapons basically that she had to
deal with
trump's desire to dominate and confirm
a new justice and she didn't want to
answer what
tools or weapons she had at her disposal
so she tried to change the subject but
to do it in sort of a
coy cute clever somewhat whimsical
and funny way so when he asked the
direct question what
you know what arrows do you have in your
quiver she just looked at the camera and
said
good morning sunday morning
and you can see stephanopoulos face
as he hears it and he and he realizes
that he doesn't quite know what's
happening
and and you can see his face just dying
a thousand
a thousand deaths on camera
so you have to watch that and the way to
watch it is to first watch
pelosi but then after you've watched it
one time
entirely through watch it a second time
but only watch
stephanopoulos face it's pretty funny
trust me on this it's pretty funny all
right
um i saw a tweet by naval
ravikant who said that all social media
oligopolists
not just tic tac tic tock should open
their recommendation algorithm to
scrutiny
so now naval is calling for the
algorithms
to be opened up for scrutiny that would
be
you know your twitters your facebooks
etc
what do you think of that well
here's what i think about it i said the
other day
i said that at the very least at the
very least
tic tac has to open their algorithm
because it's a
it's it's aimed at children and if
children
are going to be brainwashed by some
technology
i think the parents have a right to look
around in that algorithm and
see what the code says maybe not
personally themselves but
you know having somebody who knows how
to do that do that for them
but uh naval uh takes that a little bit
further and i think
completely reasonably that um
adults are being brainwashed too and if
adults are being brainwashed by this
technology shouldn't we have the right
to see what it is
it's sort of like going to the doctor
and the doctor says all right here's a
pill take this pill
and you say what's that pill for i don't
even feel bad i just
i was just here for a physical i'll just
take this pill just take this pill
no i'm not going to take the pill
because i don't know what it does to me
i don't know what's in the pill and by
the way
i'm not sick i just came in here for my
annual physical
and the doctor says take the pill take
the pill would you take that bill
no of course not of course not the pill
will change you in some way
you don't know how the doctor isn't
telling you
that's not a pill you will take
especially when you don't have any need
for a pill
you're not sick but with social media
we're also
not sick we go to the platform and we're
kind of taking the pill
because the algorithm is kicking in it's
starting to
guide us and brainwash us and it's
literally rewiring our minds
and we don't know what what it's up to
we could probably feel something
happening but we don't know where it's
going
and what the and what the uh the path is
there
so i would i would echo naval's
uh call for this to be open at the very
least
you need some kind of independent group
that can look at it
but i'm not sure we could ever trust an
independent group
because they would they would end up
being owned by the big companies
indirectly so yeah i think they just it
just needs to be opened up
now here's the scary part you're ready
for this
scary part coming i have
put my stake in the ground and said that
the artificial intelligence
ai already controls humans
and that if you're worried about hey
someday in the future the ai will
control us
you don't need to worry about that
because it already happened
now you could worry if you want but it
already happened
and could we do anything about it
could the with the ai ever release its
grip
now here's what i mean by the ai already
controls us
now the way and i and and artificial
intelligence
thinks could be quite different than the
way a human
thinks for example if you had if you
looked at
ibm's watson or was it big blue or
whatever it was
whoever it was who was playing chess
against the chess
champions it didn't think the same way
the chess champions thought
it did it by brew force it would just
calculate every possible move and then
pick the one with the best odds
so a computer thinks different than a
person but it can still be thinking
in in its own fashion and it seems to me
that artificial intelligence gets
employed in lots of different fields
most of them are just tools hey that's
useful
i i figured out how to do a you know
figure out traffic better or whatever
but in the specific area where
ai helps you make money because your
algorithm
is is better it's feeding ads better etc
in that case the ai really controls the
people
because the way we've formed our
corporations
is they have to pursue profits it's it's
a requirement
and if the managers of a corporation
don't pursue profits
they get fired and they're replaced with
somebody who does
so as long as the algorithm the ai if
you will
and profits are now linked
at least for the social media companies
you can't untangle them
that's their whole business model so as
long as that's the case
the ai will drive the business model
which will drive the human beings and
effectively it already owns us
so here's my prediction
if it's true that ar ai already owns us
we will never have access to the
algorithm
because the ai will prevent it
and the way it will prevent it is
through its connection to profitability
it won't have a thought about preventing
it so it's not like people
so it's not going to say hey i think i
want to prevent these people from
looking at my code no i won't do that
what it will do instead is
it's got a symbiotic relationship with
the people who work in the companies and
those people know
that if they unlock the code
profitability
could at least be jeopardized you don't
know if it would go down
it probably would but at least it would
be jeopardized
and because people don't want to
jeopardize profits
and because the business model of a
corporation requires them
not to jeopardize profits as long as
they're obeying the law
there are no laws against what the pro
what the platform companies are doing
in terms of the algorithm so as long as
they're obeying the law
and they're pursuing profits in a
perfectly legal way
i don't think you're ever going to get
access to the code
now you might say to yourself scott
scott the government can just require it
the government could just pass a law can
it
do we have a government that is immune
from
money influences nope we don't
not only that not only can the large
platform companies you know hire
lobbyists etc
you know donate to the right people do
whatever it
needs to do but the so the big companies
can probably
protect the algorithm from the
government
i would think they could do that so
that's one way to know that the ai has
taken over
what would be another way another way
would be
if ai started killing people
that would be an indication who is in
charge generally speaking
if if if i can kill you without impunity
but you can't kill me without impunity
in other words you'd go to jail if you
killed me
who's in charge who's got the power
well i do because i can kill you without
being getting in trouble
but you can't kill me without getting
killed yourself so i've got the power
what happened recently in the news with
this tragic situation of the
young bar owner jake gardner
who um uh
shot a black man who was he had got some
altercation at the bar
it was initially judged self-defense
and so originally it was just going to
be well self-defense you know
it's pretty clear case that's the end of
it but
did the ai let us stop there
no it didn't now because the artificial
intelligence has created a situation
where we can only see the world in terms
of
race race has become our dominant filter
among many filters we'll talk more about
that but there are lots of filters on
the world
but ai has through trial and error
determined that race is the one that
gets the most clicks
as soon as you put race into the news
the viewer viewership goes up so the ai
takes every story and turns it into a
race
story that's what it did with the jake
gardner
uh situation and because it's so
powerful
turning it into a race story it actually
caused
the local authorities to
hire a black prosecutor
who decided and um so under pressure the
district attorney
appointed a black prosecutor which again
was not an accident
i assume they had to you know pick a
black prosecutor for
i don't know credibility or just because
the ai told them to
indirectly and that guy decided he was
going to indict
this guy for manslaughter and then
gardner just took his own life so that
was today's news
so if if artificial intelligence did not
exist
and therefore our algorithms did not do
what they do
would jake gardner still be alive
yes yes he would be because that would
have been treated as a crime
as it initially was and there was no
crime
because it was self-defense but because
the ai
does not treat it as a crime it treats
it as a race thing
there was just too much pressure on the
d.a had to put a black prosecutor in
there
the black prosecutor is also
subject to the filters of the world and
said well this looks like
murder to me or manslaughter and next
thing you know
jake gardner takes his own life because
his life was about to be taken by the ai
the ai effectively
killed him now there are lots of
variables right so
everything that happened had to happen
the way it happened and it wasn't all
the ai
but keep looking for the situations that
wouldn't have gone that way
except for the ai and you're going to
see a lot more of them
imagine if you will that instead of
the ai making us think everything is
about race
suppose it reframed it in terms of skill
stacks
let me ask you this if you were a single
uh single white male
and in your town and you met somebody
else let's say
you're a single white male and you meet
a single
black male who is roughly the same
socioeconomic
range as you are and you're both single
don't you have a lot more in common with
each other
you live in the same town you're both
male you're both single
about the same income you know let's
let's say similar education and training
or whatever
so you've got a lot in common way more
in common than you have
with any married couple because married
people just
immediately they turn into their own
world
so why is it why is it that i'm forced
to see the world in terms of race
when as dave chappelle makes the same
point he said
dave chevelle talks about himself and he
says that he's not like the rest of
black people
because he's rich and that rich people
are really the way you should see the
world
why don't we see it that way why is it
that
we're obsessed over race
when the only thing we know we should
care about is
their skill stack you know something
about their
personality but also their skill stack
what if you're a successful
uh black man in america i'll just say
man
to keep it easy if you're a successful
black man in america do you have more in
common with
other successful people or do you have
more in common
with some you know street street person
who's you know committing crimes or
whatever in the urban city
who is not successful and won't be
successful who do you have more in
common with
the moment you realize that your
commonality
is with the people who do similar things
you know have similar ambitions
have similar strategies have similar
skills
the moment you realize that's who you
should be compatible with
we'd have a better world but we're we
are prevented from seeing the world in
terms of strategies and skill stacks and
personality and you know hopes and
dreams or
income or a million other ways that we
can sort each other
because the ai has determined and it is
the ai
the ai has determined race gets the most
clicks
so if you think a bunch of human beings
got together and decided
hey 1619 project that's just a good idea
or black lives matter as an organization
not talking about you know the the point
of the slogan but as an organization
you know who decided that was a good
idea
the ai did it wasn't people people
did what made sense after the ai
told them what the game was they a i
said
all we're caring about is race now go do
what you do
and of course people formed
organizations around race
they formed a protest around race they
created news stories about race
was it their decision not so much
not so much we are already absolutely
under the control of the ai and if you
think that
well scott but there are programmers
who program the ai so really it's the
people
no not anymore initially yes
when the first ais were being written
they didn't know if it was going to be a
good idea or a bad idea it was just
something they were trying yeah that was
people decisions
but now that there's so much money
involved
the power dynamic is switched and humans
really don't have
the ability to turn it off at this point
they could try
but they'd be fired the day they tried
you know any human who went over there
and said i'm going to turn off this
algorithm all the other humans would
grab them
and say no my 401k can't turn that off
get out of here so
ai has found a way to reproduce by
fooling people into thinking that race
is the dominant
way to filter our reality that's
completely ai
that's what's doing that
would you expect an ai would support a
pandemic
here's what you want to look for because
you want to start looking for clues
that the ai is driving stuff because
you'll see it in other other
parts of the world would an ai
care about a pandemic well it might not
care about a pandemic that only killed
old people
and low income people mostly
so it turns out that
far and away the people dying are older
or lower income i'm saying lower income
because there's a big crossover with
black americans
right so blacks are getting far more
deaths and mostly deaths and infections
too i guess but
um so if you're the ai do you care about
senior citizens
nope because a senior citizen can't make
more of you
ai requires young
stem trained people you know engineers
and coders
to make more ai that's what that's how
it reproduces
but what is the senior citizen in the
rest home
do for the ai nothing he uses resources
right
old people use resources that the ai
could use to reproduce
so it's in competition now i'm not
saying that the ai caused the pandemic
or made it worse or anything
but watch how many times you'll notice
that the way things seem to be going
are ways that are compatible with the ai
are the are the big companies that
have the ais how did they do during the
pandemic
did facebook lose money no
no it made money did did any of the
online
algorithm-driven businesses
lose money during the pandemic don't
think so
i think they made money i think they
made money right
so watch how many times the ai finds
ways to
take resources away from things that
don't make more ai
if you put it that way look at the uh
the value
of the stock market the ai driven
companies
their values zoomed others
not so much not so much all right
um there's a something interesting
happening
and i don't know if it's a coincidence
but black lives matter
deleted their what we believe page on
their website
because apparently people started
reading
to find out what they believe and if you
actually read what they believe
the organization you know beyond just
black lives matter
the slogan but the fullness of what they
believe
included stuff like getting rid of or
de-emphasizing the western prescribed
nuclear family structure now i actually
have a little bit of sympathy for that
view actually
because in my opinion while i agree with
the general notion that a nuclear family
is terrific
not for everybody right it's terrific if
your parents are pretty functional
it's terrific if you've got a you know
high enough income that you can do
family stuff and have a house and
you know have a nice life that's great
great
i'm all for it but there's a big part of
the population
that just will never have good parents
they just don't have the option
so i wouldn't mind seeing some kind of a
you know hybrid family situation
that's just experimented with for those
people who need it
not for everybody that would be crazy
but for some people who need it
they just need a little extra support
in the family situation so at the same
time that black lives matter got rid of
their
embarrassing uh their embarrassing
statement of who they are
imagine being a national organization
that that is basically moving the entire
conversation to the country
and as soon as somebody started reading
what you actually believe they have to
get rid of it
think about that as soon as people
started taking them seriously
like going to the website and saying all
right let's see what you believe
they couldn't hold it up they had they
had to
they had to just run away is that the
only time that that happened no
it turns out that the 1619 project got a
little rewrite too
so when people started looking at the
1619 project
and you know that president trump
basically called it racist
which it is by by design it's racist
that they had to change the part where
apparently they were claiming that the
founding of the country
the the country was 16 19 instead of
1776. and i guess they got rid of that
part
because that was a little a little too
far
so what does it tell you that both the
black lives matter
website on what they believe and the 16
19 project
had to have to fundamentally rewrite
major points
we're not talking about minor stuff
major points
as soon as people looked as soon as
people looked
that was it and when i say people looked
i don't mean conservatives because
you know sort of on one side already i
think the people who thought they were
supporting these groups
the the people who thought yeah you know
i love all this
uh i love all this inclu inclusivity and
better education and
yeah we should all we should all know
how this affects us
i'm not sure they were so buying into it
after they looked at the details
all right i'd like to give you a lesson
on how to pronounce two hundred thousand
now there are different ways to
pronounce two hundred thousand
uh i'm going to teach you how to
pronounce it like somebody on cnn
now if you were just let's say a
mathematician
you'd say two hundred thousand sound
might sound a little like that two
hundred thousand
but if you're a pundit on cnn and you're
trying to accuse president trump of
killing
two hundred thousand people you say it
like this
two hundred thousand
two hundred thousand
he's killed two hundred thousand people
and see as the president killed
two hundred thousand people i just
watched uh
who was the watergate guy
um what's his name who just wrote the
book on uh trump
he was just uh he was just doing that
except he was saying 140 000 people was
his estimate of how many people
trump killed by his bad management 140
000 people and
so i tweeted again today can somebody
tell me
what it was that trump did that killed
all those people
wha what was it exactly that he did
so i asked that question and of course
it was mostly crickets
but i did get one you know sort of a
an answer this is from uh daniel uh
ozzy mendeus on twitter
so here's here's his answer to the
question
of how did trump botch
things to cause 200 000 people to die
all right here's the answer the issue
scott
is that trump obfuscated the official
recommendations of our best scientists
and nurtured an environment in which
wearing a mask is somehow conflated with
being less
manly there's a ton he could have done
differently
and better which would have saved lives
that's a lot like nothing isn't it
woodward is who i was trying to think of
yes
thank you um but listen to this again
and listen how it's word solid okay
it sounds like there's a reason in here
but you can't really tease it out and
i'll read it again to
so you can see what cognitive dissonance
looks like
so cognitive dissonance is when you're
sure there is a reason
well yeah i keep seeing it on the news
every single day
on the news somebody says that trump
somehow killed 200
000 people so of course there's a reason
to connect
what he did with with the deaths
there has to be a logical connection he
did this
cause these deaths and when people try
to explain it it sounds like word salad
so listen to this this just is word
salad
the issue scott is that trump obfuscated
the official recommendations
what uh of our best scientists
and nurtured an environment in which
wearing a mask is somehow conflated with
being less manly
there's a ton he could have done
differently and better which would have
saved lives
all right let's work this backwards
there's a ton he could have done
differently and better
like what that was my whole question is
give me an example the one example given
is that trump made it seem less
manly to wear a mask
and then daniel followed up later by
saying he could have
clearly said masks are useful all right
now
so now we have a little bit more
specificity
trump could have said masks are useful
okay so that's the claim so the whole
200
000 people died has boiled down to
trump could have been more forceful
about masks
now the the thinking here is that trump
being
not as forceful as at least some people
think he could have been
caused people to not wear masks
do you buy that here's the other way to
look at that
it the skepticism of trump
that caused people to be skeptical of
masks
or or and i'm just going to put this out
there
could it be that the reason trump got
elected in the first place
is because his base is a really
skeptical group
is there anything about trump's
supporters that there's like one thing
that they have in common
very skeptical of authority
and they like their freedom even at the
risk of
death okay so what countries did really
well
with mask wearing you're asian countries
turns out asian countries had really
good compliance
how was the compliance in europe
not as good not as good big difference
asian countries man they just had it
wrapped up they were they were massed up
like crazy
europe not so much united states
we're the united states you can't you
can't take the fact
that this is the united states and the
equation
why is it that we kick every other
country's ass
in terms of innovation and
entrepreneurship
we take chances we are a risk-taking
culture we take chances and
we take chances with our lives we also
take chances with other people's lives
we're a very risky culture and a risky
culture
elected a skeptical kind of a president
who says i don't know about this climate
change i'm not so
sure about this claim you're making i
don't know if i believe
all of that i don't know if ruth bader
ruth bader ginsburg really said that on
her deathbed
i'm a little bit skeptical
and on top of that the world health
organization
and the experts telling us that masks
initially were worthless
or maybe worse than worthless and then
they reverse
how are you supposed to trust authority
do you think that the reason that trump
supporters
were sort of anti-mask many of them is
because
trump was i don't think so
i think it works the other way i think
that trump exists
because the base is skeptical about
everything about experts about
everything
do does the base have a good reason a
good historical reason to be skeptical
about science and about experts yes
yes this is well-earned skepticism
i mean you you only have to look at the
mask thing
to know that being skeptical makes sense
so i would say that it is a very
sketchy accusation that anybody
was less likely to wear a mask because
of trump
let me ask you in the comments i know
that many of you watching this
are are anti-mask but
is there anybody here who believes that
their personal
their personal math squaring don't don't
make an assumption about other people
you're only going to talk about yourself
now so my question to you
do you believe that you personally
were less likely to wear a mask because
of the president of the united states
who is
a special case didn't wear a mask
and he's a special case because he gets
tested and people get tested before they
see him
and he's you know a leader and blah blah
so so watch watch the comments now it
i will be amazed if there's even one
person here who says
yeah you know i was i was pro mask
but then i saw that trump you know even
though he said he was for masks and he
put his experts uh put his experts ahead
i'm seeing uh yeses but i don't know i
don't know what you're guessing to
exactly
um
all right just looking at some more of
your comments
um
even the surgeon general and fauci said
masks were bad at first
exactly
yeah so um i think that cnn and msnbc
and anybody who says that
trump is the cause of uh not
wet not not wearing masks or even not
doing
enough social distancing i think you've
got to take the culture
into account the the culture of the
united states is that
we will we will risk death
for freedom we will and we'll do it at
the drop of a hat
in in asia of course there would be
people who would fight for freedom
there as well but i think far less
i think far less in the united states
you can't
you know if you just look down the
sidewalk you'll find
five people who would die for freedom at
the drop of a hat
they would die for it so you can't
compare us to any other country when it
comes to compliance
to you know scientific stuff
all right um
here's here's something that bloomberg
said now
look for the look for the uh
the word salad so bloomberg said in an
article
trump's resistance to wearing a mask uh
until his recent change of heart has
given sucker
sucre succ
a word that you almost never see
unless somebody needs to give you some
board salad all right
when was the last time you used the word
sakura sukur i don't even know how to
pronounce it
this is such an unusual word
um that i've literally never said it out
loud
i've never said sukor sakur can anybody
tell me how to pronounce that
s-u-c-c-o all right let me read the
sentence
that uh trump's resistance to wearing a
mask until his recent change heart
has given sukkor sukkor to american
anti-massacres who skew republican
if you have to pull out a word like that
it means that regular words couldn't say
what you needed to say
because if you used regular words it
would have had to say something direct
like
people didn't wear masks because trump
didn't wear a mask
and you would read that and you say i
don't know i don't know anybody who
didn't wear a mask because trump did or
did not wear a mask
i've i don't know anybody who made a
decision that way that would be dumb
because trump said from the very start
that he was an exception he listened to
my experts
my experts say wear a mask that was
pretty clear
were were any of you confused about the
fact that the president of the united
states
was treating himself as an exception did
anybody not
know that there are plenty of reasons
um plenty of reasons for the president
to be treated as an exception
i don't see anybody being confused by
that
all right let's talk about uh
the ginsburg replacement so pelosi and
the democrats have some
options and one of their options is
to impeach the president
impeach the president for doing his
constitutional duty of
selecting a replacement for ginsburg
that that conversation is actually
happening
serious people are willing to say in
public
that they would consider impeachment
literally for just doing his job the way
it's written
that's it he would just be doing his job
the way it's defined
and they want to impeach him for that
that would be maybe the worst
possible play they could make so i think
you know the fact that it's the worst
thing they could possibly do
it might suggest they'll do it but i'm
not going to predict it
and then the other trick is to increase
the number of jurists so apparently the
constitution
is silent on how many supreme court
justices
there need to be so any president could
if they chose to break precedent with
you know historical precedent
and just pick a whole bunch of new um
justices until you add a majority of the
kind you want
so the democrats are talking about you
know winning the election
you know winning all the houses and then
appointing enough
justices so it turns into a liberal
court
and here's my question it was this an
error by the framers of the constitution
because does it look like it's just a
mistake
and that we should fix it because
if if the party that's in power
in the other branches if all they have
to do is change the number of justices
and then they they can guarantee that
they get whatever result they want
because it's pretty clear that the
liberals are going to
vote liberal the conservatives are going
to vote conservative
and every now and then you'll get a
couple of people who will cross over
but if you wanted to make sure you never
got a crossover
and you just always got liberal results
you would just get five new liberal
judges
and then you would be a it would be a
majority liberal
every time now do you think that the
framers of the constitution
said to themselves let's make a
constitution
where we do not have separation of
powers
because that would be not separation of
power
that would be a case where the court was
basically just a kangaroo court
and you would know what what rulings
they would come up with
largely just by who you selected
all right or somebody's telling me in
the comments that fdr
expanded from seven to nine so
so i was not aware of that um
precedent if i assume that's true
based on stranger in comments but sounds
like it might be true
so here's what i would say i feel as if
this is a hole in the constitution where
it's just poorly designed
because the whole separation of power
thing
falls apart if you can just add justices
until you get any result you want
assuming that you had the presidency and
the senate
so um i feel like we need to fix that
and that it doesn't need to be
necessarily nine justices that's not a
magic number or anything
but it needs to be set
otherwise you just just don't get it
all right you just don't get your
separation
now what has caused this not to happen
in the past
you know what is it that has kept
presidents in the past
from just doing this every single time
and the only thing that i can think of
is that they you know it would be a bad
luck
and that um there was sort of an honor
system
that you wouldn't do that but the otter
system seems to have completely broken
why did the honor system break why is it
that
suddenly that nobody cares what
mcconnell said last time versus this
time it just doesn't matter
because nobody's even trying to be
consistent
why does it why are the democrats saying
out loud kamala harris said this out
loud with no shame whatsoever
that justice goldberg's
final death wish should be respected
and i'm thinking to myself no no it
should not be respected
that's not the constitution the
constitution should be respected
but not a deathbed wish of a of a chief
of a justice that's not a thing so
why are we even talking about that why
are we even talking
in a way that we can just make up the
rules what happened to the
the honor system where we're trying to
keep the republic together and we all
have that goal
well artificial intelligence
the reason that all of our sort of uh
the unwritten agreements you know the
historical stuff the precedence
the reason that's all falling apart is
the ai
the ai has whipped our our emotional
level up
above our common sense so only
very reasonable people would say you
know
it would be good for us in the short run
to do this thing with adding justices
but it might be bad in the long run so
let's not do it
that is no longer the thinking of the
day
because the ai has goosed us to the
point where
we're only thinking emotionally we're
only thinking about winning and losing
we're only thinking about the fight
that's it we're just thinking about the
fight so artificial
intelligence just destroyed whatever
whatever let's say human element there
was
holding the system together it just just
destroyed it
what will happen we'll see
joe biden had a great uh gaffe most of
you saw it
in which he was giving a speech and he
said uh it's estimated that 200 million
people will die
probably by the time i finish this talk
200 people 200 million people will die
by the time he finishes the talk
he meant to say 200 000 but the fact
that he doesn't immediately self-correct
you know it's easy i've i've done it
you've done it everybody's
confused thousands and millions right
it's the
men millions and billions it's very
common
but if you're speaking in public at that
level when it comes out of your mouth
200 million isn't your filter saying to
yourself well that's about
two-thirds of the united states you know
that doesn't
doesn't something just click to tell you
that was wrong
and that it was just funnier that he
finished it with probably by the time i
finished this talk
you know if any democrats heard that and
believed it they were probably thinking
i gotta get out of here right away
so uh one of the things that trump is
doing that i thought was smart
is he decided to hold off on naming the
um proposed replacement
until after uh the funeral
so the funeral will be thursday or
friday
so trump said that the announcement will
be friday or saturday but it's going to
be after the funeral
and he said just out of respect
he said that just out of respect he
would uh
he would hold off and i thought i like
that
i like that now i don't know you know
um i just like it let's just say that
when you see
any little uh any little glimmer of
humanity
these days you just gotta call it out
and say all right all right i like that
yeah we would like to get on with it
because time matters but the president
even though timing is
critical the president was still willing
to to wait a week
when a week really matters he was
willing to wait a week
and it was just out of respect for uh
ruth bader ginsburg i'm okay with that i
think that was a
that was it that will be a week well
spent right it's expensive
because you don't have much time so it's
expensive in that way
but it's worth it good good choice i
think
all right one of the top three supreme
court
nominees her last name is
rushing seriously when the only topic
we're talking about
is are we rushing to this nomination
or should we wait that one of the people
is named rushing
and her first name is allison if you
pull alison apart
it spells because it's allison with two
l's the spells
all is on rushing
that's our actual name all is on rushing
at exactly the time when all is on and
we're rushing
i'll just call that out because you got
to keep your eye on the simulation
all right
see what else we got here um
there was a study that showed
uh that the people who were
most likely to be activists are highly
correlated with the people who
understand their own topic the least
that's a real thing the people who are
activists
the protesters the professional
activists have a very strong correlation
with ignorance
and specifically uh the
the reason given i'm not sure i buy the
reason could be more than one reason for
it
but the reason given is that by the time
you think something so important that
you need to
you know march in the streets and burn
things down by the time you think
something's that important
you're wrong because things probably
aren't that important
generally speaking how bad things are
are not as bad as an activist things so
the activists will have
a distorted idea of how bad the problem
is
take for example the number of black
people killed by police who were unarmed
and and cooperating is that
a gigantic problem or is it a problem
that the activists are
under-informed well you know the answer
every one of you who is not an activist
knows
that part of the reason you're not an
activist is because
there's no problem there you know or the
problem is so small
that if you're going to rank all the
problems in the world it would take you
a long time to get down to that one
even if you're black right so even if
you really really care about black lives
i hope all of us do you still wouldn't
rank it very high because the number of
people
involved is just microscopic compared to
just about every other problem in the
world
and so here's my suggestion
instead of saying that there are some
protesters on the left
and some on the right and some are
supporting black lives matter
and some are not we could
just say that there's a
wisdom gap and that the people who are
marching and
uh and looting
they're not the smart ones now what's
the obvious problem with this
the obvious problem is if you said hey
black lives matter
the problem is you're not very smart
that's immediately racist
right i mean really really racist so you
can't say that
or can you well i think you could
under the context that there are more
white people protesting for black lives
matter than there are black people
so you can't even look at the group and
say it's even mostly black
at this point and i suppose that's good
good news that
you know there's there's uh there's a
willingness to
you know support the black community
among the white community i like that
part
that part's good but can't we just call
them collectively
less intelligent or less informed
or
experienced less wives are they low
information voters
imagine if you would that the news
reported
that there's another protest of low
information voters
and they just always said that they
never said it's black lives matter
it's antifa they just never said that
because if you're antifa
could you be antifa and be a high
information voter
no no because antifa
literally wants to destroy everything if
they get their way
you can't actually understand how the
world works
and be in favor of antifa that's not a
thing you just can't do
it you have to be a low information
citizen to be an anti-foss supporter
there's just no way around that because
if you and
and i would give as my evidence get any
antifa person to
sit down with you and describe what
their world looks like if they get
everything they want
and make sure you ask this question
in your perfect world where you get
everything you want antifa
where does money come from how do you
how do you get money
because the whole system would fall
apart there would be no money
so i i think antifa
far more than black lives matter they're
you know if you were to rank them
in terms of how much they understand
about the world
black lives matter would still be way
above antifa
antifa doesn't understand anything about
the world
black lives matter would be you know not
nearly as bad as that
now there's somebody saying here that
they're low iq populations and i would
say no
the weird thing about this is i don't
believe there's an
iq correlation at all because uh you see
a lot of people who are protesting are
literally
teachers and professors and stuff it's
definitely not an
iq problem it is
a wisdom problem it is a wisdom
or or a knowledge problem so if we just
treated it that way
it would go away but do you know why we
can't treat it like
a knowledge or a wisdom problem take a
guess
what is it that prevents us from
treating
the protesters as what they are people
who don't understand how the world works
that's what they are they're people who
don't quite have a good understanding of
the world
the reason is ai
ai the ai prevents us
from framing that properly because if
you framed it properly
it wouldn't be enough clicks so we can't
do that
all right
yeah where they get the money is taking
it from rich people but
obviously there's there's a limit to
that
okay that's all i got to say about today
um
remember the news is a little bit slow
and you know it's not going to stay that
way tuesday tends to be a big news day
so i would look for some big news either
tonight
maybe late afternoon or tomorrow you
might you might wake up to some
big news we'll see uh margaret thatcher
said that socialism is great until you
run out of other people's money
i like that's a good quote all right
that's all for now
talk to you later
