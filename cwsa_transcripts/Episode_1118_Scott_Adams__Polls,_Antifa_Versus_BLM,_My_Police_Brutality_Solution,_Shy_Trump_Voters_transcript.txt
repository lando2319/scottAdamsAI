hey everybody
come on in it's another terrific day
it's gonna be one of the best and it
starts with
the simultaneous sip which makes
everything better we can do a scientific
test
yeah this will be a controlled
scientific test
some of you close your ears and don't
listen to this you will be the control
group
and the rest of you will hear the
simultaneous sip and participate
and then we'll compare who had a better
day you just watch
all right are you ready half of you
randomly
cover your ears and don't listen to any
of this all you need is a copper
margarita glass attacker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better at least for the
people who are listening
it's called the simultaneous hip and it
happens now go
yes coffee is the best choice
there is some controversy about it but
really there shouldn't be
so i was just a moment before i signed
on i was
uh looking at somebody wrote an article
making this observation which is funny
when you hear about it
remember when mueller testified and
everybody said
uh wait a minute we've been waiting for
however long it was two years or
whatever for mueller's report
and now we're finding out that mueller
was not even mentally capable
because when he talked everybody looked
at each other and said
um you do know there's something
seriously wrong with him right
now he's you know done a great public
service for
years so i don't want to mock him but it
is nonetheless true
that he did not look like a competent
senior citizen and now it's biden
and it feels like is there some kind of
theme going on with the with the
democrats
that they don't mind putting a white
person as you know the
standard bearer for their cause as long
as that white person is
clearly mentally incompetent
is it an accident that the two people
they've depended on
to save themselves from trump are old
white guys
who are clearly past their expiration
date
what is going on over there do they feel
like they can't put a
a capable person of color or a woman as
their standard bearer
they would still just just hold this in
your mind
the democratic party the party that
cares about
you know inclusivity cares about
everybody getting an equal
shot cares about systemic racism
on on two different occasions they've
had a chance to take out
their their moby dick you know the great
white whale
trump as their champion
an elderly white man who was clearly
incompetent
is that the group you won't run in your
country
i don't know all right so here's some
good news to start off
maybe who knows pfizer and bio
and tech are both confident they'll have
a vaccine
um ready maybe as early as october for
approval anyway
doesn't mean it'll be approved but they
might have it by then
there was a one vaccine trial some other
company
i forget who who paused it because
somebody got sick in a way that
gave them some concern chances are it's
not because of the
uh the vaccination but abundance of
caution they're going to check that out
now i'm really curious about how many of
you would take this
vaccination because
the thing with the vaccination is if you
encourage everybody else to take it but
then you cleverly don't take it yourself
that's kind of the best risk management
isn't it
the best you could do if you were just
like a total
sociopath and you didn't care anything
about other people
and you were just looking out for
yourself
wouldn't your best play be to vocally
say oh you guys you should all take this
you know take that vaccine get that
vaccination
but then you don't do it yourself
because as long as enough other people
do it it's going to stop the the spread
you just need to get
to x percentage of people who are immune
and then it's just going to die off in a
few weeks
so your best play is to get other people
to believe it
but don't privately believe it
now this puts you well all of us
and i would say me more than most of you
it puts me in a moral
dilemma it's a moral dilemma and it goes
like this
like many of our politicians
such as the president and nancy pelosi
etc
we are all and i say we as in public
figures
everybody who's a public figure is going
to have to make
a big decision
and do not do not underestimate
how how much pressure that puts on
public figures
because i am well aware that my opinion
influences other people to make
decisions now
i'm not sure i'm totally comfortable
with that but i don't mind if i've
influenced you to
let's say change your vote you know
because
i think that's fair we live in a country
where everybody's
you know jockeying to do that all the
time some people do it better than
others
i think everybody would agree that's
fair game getting people to change their
political opinion
as long as you're doing it you know
responsibly
and of course i heard tons of feedback
from people who changed their vote
in 2016 because of something i said lots
of people said that
i also heard people who made bets large
bets
larger than i think would be wise based
on things i've said about what might
happen
so when it comes to this question of
whether i personally
will take this vaccine i'm in i'm in a
tough spot
aren't i think about it because if i
were to say publicly i'm not going to
take this thing
it would cause other people not to take
it
i don't know how many i mean it might it
might be five people
in the world but it could be ten
thousand
it could you know i'm sure i've changed
more than ten thousand
votes if you count the entire time i've
been
talking about politics so i would
personally be responsible simply by
role model you know cause and effect
i would personally be responsible for
maybe
thousands of people making
a life-changing medical decision but
beyond that it's not even the the 10
000 or so just to pick a number who
might be affected directly
it also causes a change to hurt immunity
you know that's the wrong word but you
know what i mean it causes a change to
the whole dynamic
so it's not just the people directly
affected it's
we're all sort of in this together right
if you don't get the vaccine
i'm more at risk if i don't get the
vaccine
you know if you know what i mean so
what do i do what what is my moral
obligation well i've decided
as a as my strategy that i will not make
a decision
prior to hearing the full medical
case but i will not make my decision
purely on medical considerations
some people will i won't because my
decision has to be
a risk management decision that looks up
the whole
because if you're a public figure you're
influencing people
you just can't there's just no way you
can get away with that
now i could be a weasel about it and
tell you i'm not going to tell you
you know so that you could be not
influenced
i can tell you for sure that i i
legitimately don't know what i'll do
because i haven't heard the story and
i'm going to wait i will wait until the
last
moment before i make a decision because
i want all the information i can get
like right before the you know the
needle goes in my arm if i think i'm
going to do it
like the moment before the needle goes
in i'm going to be on google
i'm going to say hold hold on give me
five seconds
update latest news vaccinations
okay we're good to go but if i see
one story that pops up that says uh
maybe you want to double think this or
rethink it
might take another few days to think
about it my
i will tell you my bias
my bias have not made a decision
my bias is toward getting the
vaccination
so i want you to know that in advance
right because
transparency is going to be kind of key
here
i'm either going to tell you i'm not
going to tell you which is transparency
in a way
and that that might be the most
reasonable thing to do
if i don't want to influence your
decisions because that would be
i'm not a doctor right if i'm not a
doctor i shouldn't be
influencing you on this so i might
i might recuse myself and just not tell
you if i got it but that
doesn't feel completely responsible to
me
i feel like my special case
given that my role is helping you you
know frame
and understand your world i feel like i
have a greater responsibility than just
going silent
so this is a tough one i'm going to
weigh this you'll find out how it goes
i'm biased toward getting the
vaccination
even if it's dangerous you know even if
there's some risk
to me personally i'm biased or getting
it
i could change my mind that's just where
i'm at at the moment
all right um trump has now
announced and i don't know the details
but he says he will be substantially
lowering medicare premiums and
prescription drug
prices bringing them down to levels that
were not thought possible
now the first thing i love is if you
notice that the president
consistently uses um the phrases
nobody thought it was possible you know
everybody thought it couldn't be done
he says that about just about everything
he does nobody thought it was possible
and of course the first thing that you
think is well that's not true
i'm sure somebody thought that was
possible you know
it's it's almost never true that nobody
thought something was possible
that got done but as a
persuasion little add-on it doesn't cost
him anything
he never gets pushback when he says this
phrase nobody thought it was possible
he if you if you think about it
i don't know that he's ever gotten
pushback for that because there's always
something else
that they would rather criticize him for
so he gets this one for free
and quite seriously i've thought of
adopting it
you know adopting the technique and just
start throwing it in there
now and then i'll just say uh yeah
dilbert's in
2000 newspapers nobody thought it was
possible
everybody said it couldn't be done
you should try it as a try as a little
uh accent
enhancer to everything you say nobody
thought it could be done
even for ordinary stuff it's like i went
to the store
got a loaf of bread nobody thought it
could be done
everybody thought it's impossible but i
went to the store i bought a loaf of
bread
it just makes everything sound better
and i always laugh every time he does it
because because it works
in its own in its own little subtle way
because you don't question it it just
sort of
just goes past your defenses because
you're not really guarding against it
which is brilliant um
where was i talking about oh yeah now i
don't know if he can do this
meaning who knows if he can accomplish
this feat
he did the he did make a change
that looks like it would make
you know drugs more competitive and we
would have the most favored nation
uh right to buy them at the same price
as anybody else
which should lower the prices but i
don't know what he's doing about
medicare premiums
but it's a great thing to say right
before an election it's one of the
things a
president can say before an election to
practically buy votes with our own money
the one thing an incumbent can do
is bribe voters with their own money
i'm going to take some of your money and
i'm going to put it over here
some of your tax money to lower these
medicare
medicare premiums so that's always a
good trick
because the people who are going to lose
that money
that they're they're not thinking of
that as directly as they're thinking of
the lowered medicare
premium so it's a good it's good
persuasion who knows
how much of a difference he can make
we'll see i would love to see by the way
and i can't tell me if you've ever seen
this comparison
we've seen endless comparisons of the
president's
fact checking and not winning the fact
checking
okay
[Laughter]
and has anybody done a comparison
of the president president trump's
promises
and how well he's done keeping his
promises is that anybody looked at his
list of promises
and then what he's done to it versus
other presidents of either party
and what promises they made in that one
what percentage of the promises they
accomplished
now that would be a hard thing to
compare
because if somebody had only one promise
but it was a big one and they kept it
well that's pretty good right but if
somebody had lots of promises and they
were kind of trivial
do you care if they kept 90 of them if
they were mostly trivial
so you know it's not a direct comparison
but it seems to me just
anecdotally observationally and i'd love
to know if it's
accurate it feels to me that trump is
the best
promise keeper as a president we've ever
seen
and by promise keeper i don't mean he
accomplished everything he promised
but i mean that you can just look and
you can see he's fighting like a wounded
weasel
to make those promises happen it's just
not working in every case
because some of them are harder than
others take building the wall
has president trump put a great deal of
effort
into building a wall i'd say yes
i'd say he put his you know put his
reputation on the line
you know i'd say he laid it down on the
line i'd say he pushed every door
tried every doorknob he had lots of
resistance
he's got you know a few hundred miles of
mostly replacement wall
which is probably really good compared
to not having hundreds of miles of
replacement wall
and it feels like he's just maybe the
all-time best at at least attempting
attempting and making a serious attempt
at keeping promises i don't know i'd
love to see
a historian lay that out um
here's a question could antifa and
black lives matter the organizations be
destroyed by
having an economist on their team
because the problem with antifa and
black lives matter
the organizations you know not the idea
of black lives matter that's
that's something everybody agrees with
but the
the organization it seems to me that
their more
radical uh propositions for
getting rid of systemic racism is to get
rid of the entire system
and it feel i feel as though antifa
many of them are artists and maybe black
lives matter
i don't know how many of them are
economists or stem
people but i feel as if they needed an
economist
and i would be you know maybe willing to
help fund an economist
so that so that antifa and black lives
matter
could have the most coherent argument
for their own case
because you want them to make the best
case possible
because we live in a country in which
democracy and freedom of speech are the
the mother's milk
as we like to say of the of the nation
so i'm always in favor of even the
people i disagree
with making a really strong case
because if i can't if if we can't
prevail against the best argument
well how good is your argument you know
maybe if you can't beat
somebody else's best argument maybe
that's telling you something about your
argument
right so i'm always in favor of making
the best case even if i disagree with it
that's how our system thrives so
shouldn't antifa and black lives matter
have some good
economist uh richard
what's his name reich reich
one of the big critics of president
trump
yeah krugman how about paul krugman why
doesn't paul krugman
help antifa and black lives matter sort
of game out and
model what their preferred world would
look like
because i think if you gave them help it
would destroy them
because black lives matter and antifa
completely defend
depend for their support
from their support from anybody who's
not directly involved in the
organization
they depend entirely on people not
understanding what they're up to
am i right now i'm not talking just
about
who are the secret people funding them
you know is it george
soros trying to destroy the world is it
some shady
you know intelligence group from another
country is it russia
is it china you know i'm not even
talking about that
i'm just talking about the fact that the
the people who
may have no influence outside influence
at all
who just genuinely believe that some
kind of a
socialist looking world would be better
than this capitalist world
just let them make their best case give
them the best economist in the world
how about a nobel prize winning
economist paul krugman
would you like to see a paul krugman
assistance for antifa and black lives
matter
of course you would um that would end
all of them
i think i think that would be the end of
all of them
they would just they would just explode
um
all right rasmussen has some new
information about uh
people who don't want to tell you their
political leanings
and so the question was uh
were you less likely than prior
elections
to tell people your political preference
now keep in mind that the nature of the
question is
are you less likely than prior
elections which allows that you were
already even in the prior election
not going to tell the truth so how many
of the people
whether they were already there or not
how many are
additionally there remember so this is
on top of the people who are already
there
and not wanting to tell their preference
in the 18 to 39 year olds
it's 24 percent 24
of the younger younger people who could
vote
24 these are the likely voters 24
of them don't want to say what their
political preference is
so that's pretty telling and that's the
highest percentage
now what is it about young people
that would make them the least likely to
want to publicly say with their
political preferences
well i would think young people would
have the most social pressure
which tells you something we also see
that women
are uh substantially more afraid than
men
to say their political opinion huh
why would women be more afraid than men
to voice their political opinion
especially given that women
are far more likely to support biden and
biden is a perfectly
socially acceptable person to support
i feel as if there are a number of women
who might support trump and
maybe just can't say that out loud as
well as these
young people we'll find out so the
actual polls where people are asked who
they're voting for
appear to be looking not so good for
trump
at the moment in the battleground states
i think michigan is like plus nine for
biden
now do you think that there are enough
shy
trump supporters to close a
nine point gap that's a big gap
do you think there are that many shy
trump supporters
well according to rasmussen
you can't rule it out now of course
you know we don't know anything because
data in general is unreliable just a
sweeping generalization
about all data it's all you know
especially about politics
it's all unreliable uh and all polls are
unreliable and
you know except for the actual vote
which might be unreliable this year too
so some people are saying biden is not
socially acceptable that's just not true
biden is completely socially acceptable
because there's no recorded i don't
think there's a recorded case
of a trump voter abusing a biden voter
is there is there any recorded case of
that
but there are plenty of recorded cases
of trump supporters getting in trouble
just for
wearing a hat or whatever uh
all right um so
just because there isn't enough noise in
the news
eg carol is in the news again she's got
some defamation
thing against trump because he said that
she was
not telling the truth about her
accusations or something along those
lines
said some bad things about her maybe and
now the
because it was said on company time when
the president was president
uh the the government ends up
footing the bill to defend it so the
department of justice or whoever is
defending it
but the government is going to defend
the president and people are mad about
that
but apparently that's just the rule if
he if he did something that is causing
him to be sued
in the course of his job which is what
happened it is the government's role to
defend him
they can they can take the case if they
want to and they have
uh so
then there's a story about rochester so
rochester had some
uh protests and riots and looting and
burning
and stuff and
so the rochester police leaders resigned
and the chief of police in rochester was
black
that's right the black chief of police
was sort of forced to resign and you
know he chose to resign
but the pressure was on because black
lives matter
was feeling that the police were
prejudiced so the black chief of police
got so much pressure that he resigned
and here is the
the thing that this made me uh suggest
if you were going to try to design some
way to get to
a end of the police brutality
issue you know some way that we could
all be happy that it's handled
or doesn't need to be handled or we're
doing all we can just something that
would look like
progress how how can you do that
and here's my suggestion i think that
uh i'm going to make a guess that
there's something that exists
like an organization of black police
officers
does that exist could somebody tell me
if there's any kind of
i don't know fraternal or you know
social
or political group which is black
law enforcement people who just have
something
that they feel like they want to work on
in common
does that exist i'm assuming it exists
if it doesn't exist it wouldn't be hard
to form one
because there's such interest in in this
you know topic so suppose you formed or
already had
a group of black only black law
enforcement people
and they stepped up and they said this
we would like to be the ones to
negotiate
with black lives matter or whoever else
wants to negotiate with us
to figure out what we could do in a
practical sense
what what we could do that's different
and if we agree to it the black law
enforcement officers
we will help you help you sell it
help you sell it to everybody else but
in order to have credibility
i feel as if we're in a place where you
have to be
racist you have to actually be racist
to maybe get something useful done
that's non-racist
in this case the racist thing would be
to have the black police officers
take the lead because anything that
you know ident anything that segregates
is automatically racist just by
definition
but it might be a kind of racism
that everybody says because of the
moment
okay that makes sense you know you can
say it's racist
to just let the or or to promote the
um black police officers taking the lead
on the question of whether the police
are being
too abusive to the black population
it's racist there's no way around it
because any anytime
you know you divide people by race it's
by definition racist
but it might also be practical and it
might be the kind of racism that
everybody would say ah
okay just this once i see where you're
going with this
makes sense it's just kind of practical
maybe more credible
so let me put that idea out there that
if black lives matter wanted to actually
get something done that would be
one path that i think would be credible
but there is no evidence that they
actually want
something small done the the
the evidence would suggest that there
are a lot of different opinions about
what needs to be done
and not all of them have to do with just
solving this police thing
i would say there are as many as or
maybe more who want to change the whole
system of capitalism and you know
destroy it from the bottom up in which
case i wouldn't help at all
because they're not looking for a
solution in that case all right
here's a new
new set of social standards i would like
to promote
as you know i've said that we need to
add
two sets of uh let's say etiquette or
manners
that were not necessary in in prior
generations
one of them is that you should have 48
hours to apologize or criticize
or clarify if you get in trouble for
something you did
so everybody gets 48 hours to say oh i
didn't mean that
or clarify it or apologize whatever and
then
just accept it and move on and the other
is my 20-year rule
that says if somebody comes up with your
i don't know high school yearbook and
it's more than 20 years ago it just
doesn't matter
that we're all so different 20 years
later
that we shouldn't penalize anybody for
anything they did 20 years ago
you know unless it was you know murder
or some kind of
terrible thing like that um but here's
another one i'm going to add to the list
and it comes because
there's a new new hampshire police chief
refused to reinstate an
officer who was fired over racist
text messages so the police officer
is um accused and incredibly
obviously for sending some text messages
to his wife only to his wife
they had some unstated offensive things
that sounded racist
to the people who saw the messages now
i say that the new law the new rule
should be this
anything that you said privately cannot
be used against you
publicly in terms of making you look
like a
a bad person if it's if it's in the
commission of a crime then
yeah i mean if your text messages
you know show you're guilty of a crime
that's different but if it's a
thought crime something that would
exist only in your head and
you've only communicated it to someone
who you have a reasonable expectation
of confidentiality let's say a spouse
if you have a private message to a
spouse or lover
and somebody decides to make that public
or even to talk about it in this case i
don't know if they know the details
but the the public is talking about it
as if they know what these messages are
about i would say that the rule should
be whoever
took the message to the public is
responsible for the content
so if there were racist messages between
one police officer
and a spouse the rule would be
that whoever took that to the public is
the racist
they're the racist because a hundred
percent of the public
have unpleasant private thoughts there's
no exception to that
do you think that if you knew
everybody's private thoughts
do you do you think you'd be happy with
all of them i don't think so
the reason that we have we talk
differently in private
than we do in public is that it is
universally recognized
that when you're talking in public
you're having the impact on the public
and so if you're going to be a good
person in society
you don't want to have bad imp bad
impacts
on strangers in the public of course
so of course we have a different
standard for public stuff
but private stuff are you okay
with private conversations between
spouses
becoming a reason for you to get fired i
say
whoever is holding this up should be
fired
whoever is holding the standard up the
private communication
should get you fired from your job a
private conversation you had every
reason to believe would stay private
i think anybody who makes that public
should be fired immediately
and should be labeled a racist if the
message was racist
should be labeled a troublemaker if the
message
causes trouble etc
so this is the standard i am going to
pursue
anytime that i see anybody outed for a
private conversation
don't care what the content is do not
care what the content is
whatsoever i do care what they do in
public
i do care what they do on their job but
i don't care what they think
as soon as we allow that that standard
is okay
then it's it's just nothing but problems
every one of you has got a big problem
because you've all said things to people
you trust
that you didn't think would be
appropriate in public
so that's my take on that
um i've had a number of conversations
with
shall we say high profile anti-trump
people recently and when i say high
price
profile i mean people whose names you
would probably recognize
and you might know that they're
left-leaning
but the conversations always take this
form
and i tweeted this a lot of people said
they have the same
experience and it goes like this and
this this will be the
the sort of generic version of it
where somebody will say to me uh you
know
trump uh bit the head off a baby
and i'll say um no that sounds like
uh fake news and then i'll show a link
an argument to prove that the
ver that the person's argument against
trump is based on fake news
i've done it with the drinking bleach
hoax
i've done it with the fine people hoax
but often there's something they
mentioned that's just clearly not true
or they don't have the context or
something
so i'll add the context i'll prove to
them that the thing they think is their
biggest problem with trump
literally never happened and then what
do they do
do they say well i guess everything i've
learned is wrong
i must have a bad news source i have now
adopted your opinion and i'm pro-trump
no no they don't do that
here's what they do every time
after you prove that the main reason
that was a real reason
if it had been true it would have been a
really good reason to not like
trump but it wasn't true once they learn
that
they go with they go with they go down
the hoax funnel
as i call it and they'll retreat to this
position
yeah but look at those tweets he said
some bad stuff
or don't you know he got fact-checked
and was wrong on a fact
to which i'll say um
did you think i'm just curious
as a democrat were you under the
impression
that republicans were not aware
that the fact checkers have said that
president trump has failed the
fact-checking
20 000 times i don't think there's
anybody who's not aware of that
and i don't think there's anybody who
supports the president
who also thinks that all 20 000
fact-check things
we're just all lies
nobody thinks that they're all wrong
right
but we also are adults many of us are
and we know that there's no such thing
as somebody running for president
or even being president who is not lying
on a pretty regular basis
obama lied lots of examples
biden is literally basing his campaign
on the most well-known lies
in america most debunked lies the fine
people hoax the drinking bleach oaks
he's basing his campaign on those things
those are literally
the foundation of biden's campaign
are two easily debunked lies
and yet and yet
democrats think that republicans
haven't noticed that all the candidates
do this
like they like they think that
republicans only think that the
democrats do it
have you ever met a republican who
didn't think
that republicans also will tell some
tall tales is there anybody that dumb
and so the democrats have to form this
ridiculous opinion of the world
in order to preserve their their being
right about everything
and that ridiculous opinion is that you
haven't noticed
that the president uses a little bit of
hyperbole if you know what i mean
is there anybody here who hasn't noticed
have you been following politics
and it's the first time you're hearing
the president trump sometimes will
exaggerate
first time you've heard it democrats
literally believe it's the it's the
first time you've heard it
now that should be
a such a glaring and obvious uh
cognitive dissonance
that that should settle the whole
argument about who's hallucinating
because it's so obvious so easily you
know provable
okay let me ask you republicans
let's let's test out the theory how many
of you have never noticed
the president sometimes will exaggerate
has anybody ever noticed that sometimes
takes something out of the context a
little bit
because it makes this case has anybody
ever noticed
all right somebody says
scott says i talk to find people but i
won't tell you who
hahahahaha now
um i'm gonna block you just for being an
that's that's the only reason that's the
only reason i need
 get blocked all right um
so that's every conversation with every
democrat goes that way
all right i also learned that democrats
who are actually like smart people who
follow the news
this will blow your mind are you ready
for this there's some things you think
the democrats just say because
it's you know it might help their
argument and then there's some things
that you think they actually believe
i didn't think they believed the
following thing
i thought it was just something they say
but democrats have actually been
convinced
by the fake news that the reason the
protests are happening is because of
trump
and that you know when you hear that you
laugh
right you think because of trump
what did he do what the hell did trump
do
uh he didn't he didn't arrest anybody
i mean he's pro-police but he's not in
favor of police brutality
he's not opposed to fixing it
right exactly how did trump even get
into this conversation
did trump cause systemic racism
i don't think so if you asked
antifa and black lives matter the
organizers not
not just all the people in the streets
but the organizers and you said to them
if trump went away tomorrow would you be
good
would we all be good then trump's gone
what would they say
i think they would say hell no i think
they would say it doesn't even have
anything to do with trump
it has to do with 400 years of systemic
racism i don't even think black lives
matter and antifa blames trump for any
of it
and yet even though black lives matter
and antifa are very clearly making the
case that has to do with
you know the whole system it's not
something that trump alone is doing
what's he doing uh opportunity zones
um prison reform lowering
unemployment for black people what you
know helping
you know protecting the the lowest
income people in the country
by having strong immigration preferences
you really can't make a logical argument
to tie these protests
to trump but they're actually
educated smart people who are paying
attention
who have bought into the the fake news
framing that trump is the problem
isn't that kind of mind-blowing that
anybody would believe that
given given what we observe
so that's the power of the fake news the
fake news can make you believe something
that
is quite obviously not true really
sort of obviously and i have to admit
that as much as i you know i prefer
president trump get reelected
i kind of would like to see what
happened if he didn't
you know what i mean i kind of would you
know
there's a part of me that would like to
see biden
try to stop uh everything and now the i
asked i asked this one person i was
arguing with a
high profile person i said can you
explain to me why they would stop
like what would cause what is the
situation
in which biden would fix something
that trump is not willing to fix or able
to fix
and the argument went like this that
because
biden would have the right let's say
attitude
and the right incentive and credibility
that he would be the adult in the room
and then he would start negotiating and
of course you can't get everything at
once
but you can at least start to move in
the right direction
toward making things better for you know
for everybody but black people in
particular
and that if biden were in the
in the leader chair sure you wouldn't
solve
you know uh systemic racism right away
but he would start chipping away at it
and sort of
moving things in the right direction
such that the energy would come out of
the protest and they would say okay
we wish it were faster but now things
are moving in the right direction
is that the most ridiculous opinion
you've ever heard
because i think it doesn't understand
the protests at all
because the protest the protesters have
flat
out rejected small change
they have rejected without conversation
any specific solutions they don't want
any specific solutions
if you don't know that
i don't know if you should have an
opinion on this stuff that's the most
basic thing you should know
is that they're not asking for anything
in particular
if you don't understand they're not
asking for anything in particular
they want the whole system destroyed and
then
it will be rebuilt in a way that they
don't want to specify
if you don't understand that you don't
know what's going on
all right um
did you know that the history of antifa
is a little uh
shall we say complicated now because
history is written by winners and
and and i doubt everything i read
everywhere these days
um take this with a little bit of
grayness
assault but this is my understanding
that antifa was founded by this guy
ernst
fellman he was a german guy
in 1932. do you know what was happening
around
the 30s in germany yes it was about the
same time that hitler was rising
now hitler of course wanted to overthrow
the
weimar republic the government of
germany
but another entity that wanted to
overthrow the government of germany
was antifa now antifa
formed by this guy ernst talman
was essentially a stalin
guy so he was a communist
who stalin supported and he supported
stalinism and so antifa
was originally founded to be pro-stalin
and against any form of capitalism now
here's the other interesting thing
fascism as it was originally
put into the name antifa auntie pha
didn't mean the same thing it means
today
so the whole argument that the anti-fa
people make is they say hey it's right
in our name
we're anti-fascist it's writing the name
it we can't not be that because it's
right there in the name
but it turns out the fascist didn't mean
the same thing
fascist just meant anybody who wasn't a
communist
that's it at least according to
wikipedia's telling of it
that it just meant that you were in the
late stages of capitalism
so it didn't matter if you were
socialist capitalism etc
so antifa would have been against a
bernie sanders presidency
let me say that clearly antifa
as it was originally founded and what
the name
anti-fascist meant back then
he would have been against bernie
sanders because bernie sanders would
have
still democrat she would still have
democracy
he would still have capitalism but it
would be a socialist
capitalism that's no bueno for antifa
means anti-bernie sanders
in its original form so if they try to
tell you it's anti-fascist
you should say it is it's totally
anti-fascist
and one of the things that is considered
fascist
is bernie sanders entire platform i'm
not making that up
that's originally what antifa meant and
they haven't said
we've changed it so they would oppose
bernie sanders
i wonder if how many people know that
now both the nazis and antifa
i've said that they were allied in
defeating the german government and
therefore that would make them an
ally of hitler now
i got a little pushback from that andres
backhouse who's german
he's german so he gets to have a better
opinion than we do on this
he said no no you can't call them allies
because they were also killing each
other
it's just that they had a common enemy
in the german government
but they didn't love each other and
indeed as soon as
hitler came to power one of the first
things he did was you know
crush antifa so i will take that as true
but it is also true that the enemy of
your enemy is kind of your friend
and i would argue also that the united
states
was allied with stalin against
germany so in the same way that the
united states was allied
with russia even though we weren't
friends
we were just we had a common enemy
antifa had a common enemy and they they
were on the same side with hitler
uh for different reasons all right
uh but they also were they they also
hated each other so you've got to add
that in there too
all right um i'll bet that surprised you
uh peter navarro likes to stir the pot
which makes me like him uh i i can
understand why
president trump likes peter navarro i
assume he does i mean
maybe that could change tomorrow but
navarro goes for blood on social media
and also in his interviews
he doesn't leave anything on the table
you just he just like
you know goes for the the provocation
and he's not afraid of it
so you can see why trump would like him
if if that's the case i hope it is
but there was a new study if you will
in which um some credible group looked
at all the other studies
so it's observational it's not one of
these gold standard
randomized trials that you'd want but
when they looked at all the existing
studies
they found this no credible study
found worse outcomes with
hydroxychloroquine use
no credible study no mortality or other
serious safety issue was found
conclusions uh the conclusion is that
hydroxychloroquine
is consistently effective against coven
19
when used early in the outpatient
setting it is overall effective against
cover 19
it has not produced worsening and it is
safe
so again this is a study of studies
so the flaw if there is one don't know
if there is one but
the potential flaw and the reason that
randomized
trials exist is that all of those
studies
could have the same flaw that's possible
in fact it's not even that crazy
that they would all have the same flaw
because the flaw could be this
the doctors get to decide who gets the
drug
that could be the flaw so if the doctors
are making a similar kind of bias
on average then then every study
would have that same bias in it and what
would be that bias
let me let me just say
suppose that if somebody looked like
they were in really bad shape
you would be less likely to give them
hydroxychloroquine
and more likely to say well we better
move you directly to
whatever's a you know more more end of
life dangerous situation so it's
possible there's a selection bias
don't know that but i'm gonna still
stick with my
thirty percent estimate uh thirty
percent
uh odds just based on stuff we see in
the news not based on me knowing
something in some deep way but i'd say
there's still a good 30 percent chance
that hydroxychloroquine is the real deal
and 70 chance that it might be
overstated
but i doubt it's dangerous all right i
ran a poll
and i a twitter poll so it's not a
scientific poll but i
asked the following question in your
personal circle are you hearing more
whispers about voters moving
to trump or away so you know you're
always here before an election i used to
vote this way but now this year i'm
going to vote that way
70 percent of the people said that
they'd heard
people in their own circle their
personal circle
seventy percent of them said they'd
heard people say they were moving
to trump and
four point three three percent said
they'd heard it go the other way
now of course my audience on twitter is
highly
biased but it was 32 000 people voted
and 70
70 of them are willing to say
that they've heard people going to trump
but not away now would you necessarily
hear about it
if people went from trump to biden
probably probably that sounds exactly
like the sort of thing somebody would
say out loud
how likely are you to hear it the other
way that somebody says i'm going to vote
for trump but
you know i didn't vote for him the first
time well
they usually whisper that that's sort of
a whisper conversation
so this is a deeply non-scientific poll
but uh when you get it when you get a
result that that's grotesquely balan you
know unbalanced
it's still unscientific
but i feel like it could mean something
um the michael the michael cohen book
is hilarious because he makes all these
claims
and i don't think anybody cares i just
don't think anybody cares
now of course michael cohen falls into
my category of he's the
because if there was anything that trump
ever said to him in confidence
that cohen decided to put in a book that
does not reflect on trump
that's my rule it only reflects on cohen
so if there was something that he
alleges was you know
racist or offensive in some way
and by the way we confuse offensive and
racist
all the time i feel like we should do a
better job
of distinguishing what's racist from
what is
offensive because you can be offensive
to anybody
doesn't mean that you hate them for
their color you are just offensive
um anyway
but what was funny about peter navarro
and hydrox chloroquine
is that in his tweet he starts it with
even more blood
blood on the hands of cnn which
which is a great framing
because should time prove peter navarro
correct
and the people who think hydroxyquality
color can
should they be correct in the long run
and i think there's a good chance of
that
then cnn does have blood on their hands
and a lot of it
and that's just the truth so we'll see
um this is
this is so awful so kabul harris
went and visited with uh jacob
blake who is credibly accused of some
bad crimes and after she talked to him
yeah he's the one who was shot seven
times but survived shot by cops
and she told them she was proud of him
now megyn kelly wasn't too happy
about that and she tweeted this
proud of him proud of him
he's accused of breaking into a sleeping
woman's house
sexually assaulting her humiliating her
and later returning to harasser
then the cops she called for help say he
resisted arrest
assaulted them and went for his knife
how about a word for his victim
senator that seems like a pretty
reasonable comment doesn't it
i would say that megyn kelly has every
right to this tweet
uh because it sounds solid to me and
i say again that black lives matter
if you keep if you keep what's the right
word idolizing or
or making heroes and of the people who
appear to be criminals you know they
haven't all been convicted but
they're credibly accused if you keep
making heroes
and giving respect to literally
criminals
you just can't be taken seriously you
just can't be taken seriously
so stop asking us to stop asking us to
take seriously
making heroes and a criminals at the
same time
you want confederate statues to be taken
down
i'm in favor of taking down confederate
statues because they're offensive
but don't don't then reverse your
opinion and say oh
we can't make heroes out of these
confederate statues guys
because of slavery
but why would you make a hero out of
somebody who is a sexual abuser
allegedly credibly accused
and then an actress
who did not like megan kelly weighed in
um
rosanna arquette who was sort of a
vocal democrat artist
and she said to megyn kelly about after
megan's
comment you are a disgrace to journalism
do you notice a pattern here here's the
pattern
megyn kelly gives an opinion backed by
factual reasons right that's what
happened
so megan kelly said this person has all
these accusations against them
maybe you shouldn't show you know pride
in somebody who's got those
against them so she showed her reason
she gave her opinion based on the reason
okay and what does the democrat do
goes after the person you're a disgrace
to journalism
but rosanna you left out your reasons
this is this is how the hoax funnel goes
here are my reasons
okay your reasons were all debunked oh
yeah you're a jerk
well that's not an argument after you
lose your argument you're
supposed to do something else go find
something else to do
you don't double down by saying the
person is a jerk
and don't even give a reason
so you'll see that pattern a lot
the atlantic which did the fake news
about
president trump recently now when i say
it's fake news
this is another standard which i insist
on
and the standard goes like that this if
any journalist or any person
presents a package of claims and you can
debunk
any part of the package but you can't
tell one way or another whether the
other stuff is
true let's say because it's a anonymous
source
so you can know that the anonymous
source said it but you can't
independently
verify it but the part you can
independently verify
turns out to be completely false like
not even close to true
you should discount all the rest of it
that should be the rule like the steele
dossier
if you found out that some part of it is
clearly and obviously not true
obviously created to fool you you should
discount the rest of it
now you might want to look into it but
you should certainly discount it while
you're looking into it
and i would say that would be a good
standard to have
um so the atlantic did yet another um
fake news and it was about there was
something a video of
biden appearing to walk through a
cemetery
and it the fake news was that people
were bothering him when he was visiting
his
deceased son at the cemetery except
his deceased son was not in that
cemetery
and biden was not in the cemetery
he was photographed through a cemetery
as he was leaving a church that happened
to have a cemetery in front of it
so he wasn't in a cemetery really he was
just
passing through where one was nearby
his son wasn't there none of the story
was true
comes from the same organization the
atlantic
one of their writers that the other
stories that you're supposed to believe
are true
this should be enough to tell you that
the atlantic is just not something you
should pay attention to
all right apparently trump said
in his speech yesterday that he'll
provide school choice to every
parent in america that should be enough
for him to win the black vote
don't know if it will trump also banned
anti-white training in government now he
doesn't call it anti-white
or maybe he does but it was the critical
race theory
now uh critical race theory
its proponents would say is trying to
remove racism
but anybody who looks at it can plainly
see that it's anti-white
by its nature so it is racist
by its nature and the president quite
rightly got rid of
racist training in the government
and brian stelter said
here was brian stelter's comment about
the president getting rid of
racist training he goes it all comes
back to whiteness
and the backlash to a browning america
and the president
he eats it up and the feedback loop
spins round and round
so to brian stelter it's all about
whiteness so that's not a good
contribution
uh brian uh and the best story of the
day is that the
new norwegian uh parliamentarian
parliamentarian
nominated trump for the nobel peace
prize
and justification for the nomination
was that trump uh helped to bring about
the deal with the uae
and israel and also he was
he was key to getting south korea and
north korea to be
in conversation now are those two things
first of all are they true yeah
yeah totally they're totally true
so is this nomination credible and
one that you should take seriously yeah
yeah it is now i don't think politically
speaking i doubt
that the president can get the award but
is it perfectly reasonable that he
should be one of the top people
in contention i don't even know who the
others would be
who would be who would be number two
that you could think of that would get
the nobel prize for peace
who's number two seriously name
name one other person in the world
that you could think of who might be
in the top two or three i can't think of
one
can't think of one that doesn't mean
he'll win but he's clearly the one
but here's the part that i wonder about
a deal between israel and the uae
is a deal between primarily jewish
people
and islamic people
you're with me so far not a hundred
percent but largely speaking a deal
between israel and the uae
is jews and muslims
getting along right now who
was key to organizing this it was
jared jared kushner took the lead in
getting this
done now how does that
fit with the democrats and cnn's belief
that president trump hates all of those
people
so the claim that cnn and the
anti-trumpers have been making since day
one
is that the president doesn't like
muslims
that he supported the this is the fine
people hoax
that he allegedly supported the people
who were anti-semitic
which would mean that the president
doesn't like israel
doesn't like jews and certainly doesn't
like jared kushner
who is jewish so this is what
cnn has sold to its idiot viewers
that the president doesn't like any of
those groups
and at the same time you have to explain
to the
the little confused the cnn viewer heads
can you explain why the cnn tells you
that the president
hates you know hates jews hates muslims
and obviously would hate his own
son-in-law for being jewish
how do you explain that he's nominated
for a nobel
prize for helping those groups
achieve peace does that make sense
in your world view that that would be a
major
priority for the president to get peace
for the two groups you say he hates why
is he working so hard for a piece
for groups he doesn't like according to
you doesn't quite make sense
does it which worldview would have
predicted this
well my worldview predicted this
because if you will look at my if you
look at my blogging record
you will find that i might be one of the
earliest people who said
you know i think trump can actually make
peace in the middle east
now other people have said it but i
think you will see that my record
is one of the first ones to say i think
he's going to make this happen now it's
the beginning of something that could be
better we hope it goes in the right
direction
but if your worldview did not predict
this
then you should adjust your worldview my
worldview
predicted it and it happened every time
your worldview predicts something that
does happen
give yourself a check mark but also keep
track
if your worldview predicts the opposite
you're going to have to keep track of
that too
i recommend this because otherwise you
just don't know how much
cognitive dissonance is getting to you
all right
those are the fun stories for today um
and is there anything i missed
oh yes serbia the serbian and kosovo
deal i don't know much about it
but that would be yet another example of
the trump administration
being useful to get two warring sides
together oh and the other
the other argument was uh in the
nomination for the nobel prize
peace prize that uh it was noted that
trump broke a
39-year pattern
of of the u.s presidents getting us into
war
so trump is the least
warring person
as president that we've had in 39 years
somebody says greta will win it if greta
wins the nobel peace prize
and trump doesn't do we need a nobel
peace prize
we can just stop talking about the nobel
peace prize if uh
yeah oh yeah there's a story tucker
carlson was
talking about there's a taped
conversation between michael cohen
and jeff zucker of cnn
uh in which it is revealed that zucker
was hoping
hoping for the best from trump and
i don't think he thought trump would get
elected but it sounded like
zucker was trying to maybe get a tv show
going
on cnn with trump so it looked like uh
zuku was playing both sides there so
that was interesting
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
thank you lynn that's very nice of you
to say and i will talk to you
later
