well good morning everybody
welcome to my last day on social media
according to most of my followers
i've accepted a challenge we'll talk
about that later
to violate the narrative and see if i
get kicked off of social media
so
let's see what happens
but before we do that would you like to
have one
possibly final simultaneous sip it might
be the last one ever
and
actually it might be the last one ever
this is real by the way i i actually am
going to see how close i can fly to the
sun
and i'm doing it
for the purpose
of making a point
now if i get deleted from what i say
today
we really have a problem in this country
if i don't
well maybe i will have defined the
boundary and will have a little better
sense of what gets you kicked off but
first what about the simultaneous sip
yeah all you need is a copper mugger
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled and possibly final
pleasure
it's called
the simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen
now
yeah it's good
it's good
well we're gonna wait for the audience
to build up for the big
the big event to see if i can get kicked
off social media
uh but before we do that let's talk
about some other things
i cheekily ran a little a little
question on twitter
because i'm always interested in whether
our
decisions are made by
reason and good data
or are our decisions made irrationally
and then we rationalize them after the
after the event and so i asked the
following question
uh i gave people two choices they could
have a 100 chance of dying
or a 25 chance of dying
what do you think people
uh chose
you could have a 100 chance of dying or
option 2 a 25 chance of dying
which did they choose
well
of course i'm uh
i'm sort of
presenting the situation in a misleading
way
to make a point because i didn't ask it
as simply as that
i rather complicated it with a
hypothetical
that the the reason that you would
either die or not die based on those
odds
uh would have to do with vaccination
so i thought to myself what would happen
if you just introduced the idea of a
vaccination
into a decision which is amazingly
simple
would people have trouble
answering a really simple question
if you just added a little vaccination
in there
or are we so worked up about
vaccinations
that even if you eliminate all risks
and say it's either 100 chance of dying
or 25
you get to pick but it's about
vaccinations as soon as you throw the
vaccinations people can't answer the
question
now of course they suspected a trick
they were like hmm
i'm not sure i want to answer this
question because then he's going to turn
it into something else
no
no i wasn't going to turn it into
something else i just wanted so let me
give you the exact question
if the next variant
so if if the next variant were to spread
as easily as omicron now the idea is
that everybody would get it eventually
because omicron is sort of unstoppable
but
i had a 100 death rate so imagine that
there was some new virus that came out
that killed everybody
in a month doesn't kill them instantly
they linger for about a month so that
they can spread it to other people it's
the worst case scenario
100 of people die
but not until they've spread it around
which would be weird right because most
viruses if it kills you
that that stops the virus but this is a
weird one hypothetically
it's not a real one but hypothetically
it sticks around and affects everybody
and then 100 of you die
or
or hypothetically and this is not real
you could take a vaccine again
hypothetically
no real data here
with a known 25 chance of killing you
about a 75 percent protecting you
as soon as i threw the vaccine in there
uh
as soon as you threw in the uh
the vaccine part people couldn't answer
the question
now i think the reason they couldn't
answer it is that there's a consistency
issue that we all have
so if you've taken a stand
it's hard to change your stance even if
the data changes
we all know that right you're all aware
of that in yourselves right
would you say that's true of yourselves
that once you're you've decided you're
the person who always says x even if
there's some information that maybe
doesn't make that look like a good idea
you still want to be the person who says
x because that's who you were it's who
you want to be
it's hard to change your consistency
and so uh you should read the thread of
how people responded to a 100 chance of
dying versus a 25 chance turns out
it was a much harder question
than people thought
um i would like to give you uh i'd like
to
compliment the people who answered it
correctly
so among the people who answered them
correctly
one of them said yes yes they would
rather have a 20
25 chance of dying than 100
somebody's asking what time frame
uh well remember it's omicron so it's
going to get you you could hide it in
the woods forever
but
once you get out of the woods you're
going to get it from the animals
because the animals will have this new
virus too now of course everybody wanted
to do
kobayashi merumi
and and change the question
well if i were to change the question no
no you don't get to change the question
anyway i don't think that proved
anything but it was a fun little
experiment to see if somebody could
answer the simplest question in the
world if you complicated it by adding
the word vaccine
as soon as you add that word people just
their powers of reason just go sideways
eric weinstein answered the question
correctly
the correct answer is
of course you take the 25 percent over
the 100 percent
but
beware of people who
use
hypotheticals like that in the wrong way
so i don't think there could have been a
more perfect answer to the question
yes
yes
but beware of this you know this
technique
of course you should
now yesterday i was having a lot of fun
with my critics and ian miles
cheong noticed and he said
watching people get mad and unfollow
scott adams says for refusing to
validate
their confirmation biases by punching
through their echo chamber should be a
reminder that everyone no matter where
they stand on the political spectrum is
vulnerable to mass formation psychosis
so ian thinks that people are suffering
from this thing called confirmation bias
and that that's why they're having a
trouble with my opinions this
confirmation bias
so i responded to and i said what is
confirmation bias
i've never heard of that
but i'll tell you what people have
informed me i'm doing
so this is what people told me i was
doing yesterday nothing
nothing about confirmation bias what
they said is that what i'm actually
doing is trying to
cope
because i was quote afraid of the koof
while i was wrong about all the things
that i never actually said
and also i was refusing to quote accept
the l
while everyone dunks on me and i
marinate in my ratio
so ian i appreciate that you're trying
to defend me in a sense and thinking
that my critics were suffering
confirmation bias but i don't think
that's the case
i think the problem's on my end
what with my coping and being afraid of
the couf and being wrong about the
things i've never said
refusing to accept the l
getting dunked on and marinating in my
ratio
so that's what's really going on
well the ceo of volkswagen um just
tweeted that uh we need more cooperation
and presence in china not less
because it would be very damaging to
germany if the eu wanted to decouple
from china
and it made me wonder
i'm starting to see a pattern here
it's like it's like germany has a theme
it's like they have a theme
i think germany's theme is
if i may paraphrase it
trusting the wrong people
what is up with germany
trusting the wrong people let me give
you an example
they trusted greta tunberg and then
started closing their nuclear plants
and then ran out of electricity
they
are trusting putin
to have a pipeline and give them some
some gas
that seems like a bad idea
trust in putin
and now uh the ceo of uh
volkswagen says we should trust china so
that's president xi
so say germany has this pattern of
trusting the wrong people
then so there was greta tunberg
vladimir putin
president xi
i feel like there's somebody i'm
forgetting
was there anybody else that germany
trusted that they shouldn't have
historically
i don't know
kaiser wilhelm kaiser wilhelm
i feel like there's still one i'm
missing i don't know if you can think of
it
get back to me on that but speaking of
mass formation psychosis uh several of
you
quite reasonably
quite reasonably
criticized my opinion on it
now are you should you be surprised that
i just said that the critics were quite
reasonable well you should be because i
have i have it on good authority that i
have never
ever ever
admitted i was wrong
but i'm doing it now
i think my critics were correct i should
have done more reading on this mass
formation psychosis
before brushing it aside as nonsense
so yesterday i did a deep dive
uh you know back to the original
source find out what he said etc
and uh this thing is way scarier than i
thought
so i i sort of brushed it aside as
simply new words for something we
already knew
that people are irrational and it's easy
to get them worked up about anything
so i thought it wasn't adding a thing
and then i looked into it and saw the
full presentation and
it's really scary
it's really scary
but not in the way you think
so let's let's dig into that so mass
formation psychosis
the idea is that
when people are afraid let's say there's
a totalitarian government and just tells
them there's something to be afraid of
there's some entity or
or some other
that they should be afraid of
that will get people in a
irrational sense of fear
and then they will grab onto
whatever the leaders tell them
because they need some kind of certainty
and confidence they can they can't
handle the the unknown part of it now
this can be exacerbated says the theory
by social isolation or isolation
and some would say that the pandemic is
exacerbating the social isolation
so
so far every bit of this i agree with
but it's also ordinary
if you were a
uh
oh i should have added this one
we have a new on youtube
so i forgot to add when i was mocking my
critics that if you find yourself in the
hole stop digging scott
so let me revise let's get back my
critics are so good
that uh
so what i'm doing is uh i'm coping
because i'm afraid of the couf i'm wrong
on all the things i've never said i'm
refusing to accept the l uh i'm in a
hole i keep on digging
and everyone's dunking on me and i'm
marinating in my ratio but thank you for
that that update so back to mass
formation
psychosis
um so yes we have all the conditions for
mass
formation psychosis
but i will i will say that anybody who
had a background in psychology or
persuasion or hypnosis
would be completely familiar with this
mass formation psychosis thing
there wouldn't be actually anything
new in this like actually nothing new
now do you believe me
how many believe me when i say that if
anybody studied even a little bit in
this field
you would know completely this whole
mass formation psychosis all of the
parts of it are just ordinary
have i ever told you that
fear is the strongest persuader
of course of course i have lots of times
have i ever told you that if people are
uncertain you know they'll gravitate to
a confident voice
i don't know if i ever told you that but
that's just basic understanding within
the field
right so everything that's in this idea
of the mass formation psychosis
is ordinary
but real
is both ordinary and totally real
every bit of it so
do you think i'm debunking any of it
does anybody think i'm debunking the
idea
of a mass formation psychosis either
what causes it
or the fact that we're in one right now
i'm not debunking it right
i'm i'm wholly accepting it without
change
completely accepting 100 of it
but none of it's scary
so far
because it's also our normal situation
do you remember uh when how many of you
are old enough to remember reagan's
presidency do you remember the reagan
presidency
there were
it was uh he was a fascist he was hitler
there were riots in the streets and it
was a mass psychosis
it was a mass formation
psychosis um do you remember weapons of
mass destruction
and and then 9 11
those were mass formation psychosis now
those based on real stuff at least the
911 was real
uh ish depending on your point of view
but that was mass formation psychosis
trump derangement syndrome mass
formation psychosis
uh some would say climate change now you
would get a disagreement of opinion
there some would say climate change is a
real thing
but on top of it there's a mass
formation psychosis
now here's my question to you
and i'll tell you why i'm so afraid of
this thing
why are we all talking about it now
it's not because dr malone
brought it up is it
because i thought i was seeing it before
he brought it up can you give me a fact
check on that
fact check me it was he brought it up
after it was already out there right
true right
so it wasn't because he brought it up on
joe rogan which would make anything get
a lot of attention
but it was already out there now
why is it already why is it out there
now
why is it a big topic that's trending
now
now when i watched one presentation of
it the implication was
that there's some kind of ruling elite
that are unnamed
and that that ruling elite is acting
sort of like a
um
a dictator effectively
and that is putting people into this uh
menticide
situation where they don't believe any
of the news everything's bs
so they don't know what's true and then
they're easy to manipulate
um
so all of that's happening
but do you think that there is actually
an elite group who are making actual
conscious decisions to do this
and who are the elites are they
democrats or are they republicans
or is this priming us for trump
in case trump runs again is this saying
hey watch out this is how dictatorships
get formed so you got to watch out for
trump
who is it
against is is the mass formation
psychosis an attack on
the democrat elite
you know the deep state so to speak or
is it a preemptive attack
on whoever runs as a republican
why is it out here now
when suddenly
it was always the case since reagan and
and none of us knew right none of these
ideas in this
mass formation psychosis are new
actually they're very old they're
they're all very old ideas
so why are we all talking about it
do you know where i'm going with this
there is
some force
that put this into our heads
and this is a narrative
what does it mean when a new narrative
is introduced
because the idea of a mass formation
psychosis
is a narrative
right
it's a it's a story to explain something
that's a narrative a story to explain
something doesn't mean it's true
or the only story that can explain
something is just one
this is literally a piece not literally
this is a
like
a piece of software that has been
slipped into our operating system
so where some of you
were not so aware that there's a thing
called a mass formation psychosis
and you were probably less aware
that it's something you should worry
about at the moment
scott's doing a 180 no wait for it wait
for it
wait for it
don't assume you know where i'm going
um
so here's my concern
my concern is whoever introduced the
idea of the mass formation psychosis
into the public
in a way that made it trend etc
i don't think that happened organically
do you
it could have yeah you can't you can't
eliminate the possibility that it
happened organically but it doesn't have
the smell of an organic thing
it has the smell of something that
somebody pushed into our software
because somebody and this would be
speculative right
it looks like somebody has an advantage
or imagines an advantage
for making this a
a program that runs in your head
such that the next time you see
something you can fit it into that frame
because until you have the narrative the
new things you see in your environment
don't fit into a story they're just
things but now you have a narrative
and you see the new thing might be
confirmation bias
you might be over interpreting that
thing but you're going to add it to your
framework now because it exists
and this idea will probably just keep
getting stronger because you saw what
happened the last two weeks
that this whole idea went from something
you hadn't heard of many of you
to something that's like the big thing
we all have to worry about
i don't believe this is organic
but it's also unclear who would do this
it looks like it's preemptive
to take trump out
to get people all worried about trump
but here's the real meta part are you
ready for this
so here i'm going to go super meta here
if that's maybe i'll be using the word
wrong we'll find out
but the mass formation psychosis says
that one way to control people is to
scare them
and then give them some certainty
so that their fear goes away
that's what the mass formation psychosis
idea is doing the mass formation
psychosis idea is the fear
it is the fear
and it gives you the reason
like the explanation here here's
something really big and scary to be
afraid of hitler hitler hitler hitler to
be afraid of
and here's and here's the solution
do you think it's a coincidence that
they talked about how scaring you can
manipulate you and then gave you a thing
to scare you
and then manipulated you with it
this is a little bit too on the nose if
you know what i mean
like everything about this topic smells
of intentional
it does not smell organic
so
if you said to yourself hey
there's this thing called mass formation
psychosis i should learn about it and
then i should incorporate it into my
point of view
i feel like you've been brainwashed
because there's nothing here
the mass formation psychosis adds
nothing
nothing it's all a bunch of stuff
everybody in the field has known forever
there's not a single new idea here
and
it has nothing to do with the current
moment
here's one of the ways you know
something is a fake i've told you this
technique before if they say five things
that are true
and then slip in one that you know isn't
then you know it's brainwashing
right
right you could call that the hannity
trick but he's not the only one that
does it right
you see it on the left and the right
you'll say a bunch of things that are
true and people go huh
and you'll slip one in there it's not
quite true
here's the one that's not quite true
we are socially isolated
and therefore more susceptible to bs and
and believing things that are not true
that's not true
we're not socially isolated
we might be physically isolated but with
social media we are more connected than
at any time in human history by far
not even close
and if the point is how do you know that
something's true or not
unless you've got somebody showing you
the counterpoint
social media is nothing but a bunch of
counterpoints
social media is the opposite
of what mass formation psychosis would
require
mass formation psychosis requires you
not to have access to the entire world
to tell you you're wrong but social
media gives you access to the whole
world now the problem is you get in your
bubble right
if you're in your bubble social media
doesn't work to help you at all it just
makes everything worse
uh but i reject the idea that we are
socially isolated in a way that would
make mass formation psychosis worse
in fact the entire
all right let me give you that
let me give you my best guess what's
going on here
there is one entity that would benefit
the most
two entities actually collectively that
would benefit the most from making you
think that mass formation psychosis
is the thing you should focus on
imagine it as a diversion
imagine it as taking your mind away from
something that somebody doesn't want you
to think about
what is it that's happening in the world
this big
that there's some entity or entities
that don't want you to think about it
but they'd rather you concentrate on
this new idea
this whole this
this mass formation psychosis
and the answer is the news business
the news business
because you know what the other the
alternative explanation
for mass formation psychosis
what is the alternative explanation for
everything you see
without without ever needing mass
formation psychosis
fake news
fake news gives you everything
that mass formation psychosis promises
it gives you fear
it gives you
certainty that you latch on to even
though it's not true
right
so if i had to guess
somebody who is involved with either
social media
misinformation
or the news and fake news
wants you to think that you should
really be looking at this new
smart idea called mass formation
psychosis and don't concentrate so much
on the fact that your algorithms are
rigged allegedly
and your
news is fake intentionally
am i right
doesn't doesn't mass formation psychosis
seem like an empty theory that has no
purpose other than to distract you from
the obvious problem that the news is
lying to you
am i right
i mean i can't say that anybody did that
with intention
i'm just saying it reeks
it reeks of intention
i don't have any evidence of it but it
reeks of it
all right
uh rasmussen asked did a poll and asked
if people if they thought the january 6
riot at the capitol
represents a threat to american
democracy
huh the threat to a huge american
democracy well that would be a scary
thing
what what would help the public
if there was a scary thing
and they felt all uncertain
well how about the left gives you an
answer and says it's an insurrection and
put some of those scary people in jail
then you'll feel better won't you
you're concerned about
this happening again
uh well in the answer to the question 35
percent of the people
said that uh the riot on january 6 was a
threat to the american democracy
but 43 said no
that's a pretty substantial difference
and 21 said not sure
so a full
uh 64 of the public
is either not concerned
or definitely isn't worried about the
capital uh riot
and we're still doing a an entire like
committee investigation about the thing
that 64 of the country thinks isn't even
a thing
why why would the fake news and the
liars in congress want you to be
thinking about a mass formation
psychosis
because they don't want to tell you that
they're lying about january sex right in
front of you it's fake news
you don't need any complexity to
understand that if the news is lying to
you you've got some you've got some
trouble
sure enough
all right i did a thread today about
systems
as you know i am somewhat well known for
saying that the systems are better than
goals and a good system
is a great thing here are some good
systems capitalism is a good system
lots of flaws
but one of the great things about
capitalism is you can populate
capitalism with a bunch of defective
human beings
and somehow
it still works
at least it works better than the
alternatives right so you can take
defective humans put them into this
system called capitalism
and somehow the system
corrects on average for all these
defects and gives you some kind of a
generally good result over the long term
democracy and and the republic are a lot
like that too you can take all these
uninformed
you know not too smart citizens plug
them into this system called you know
democracy the republic
and it sort of
works
which doesn't make sense you know if you
looked at it on paper how do you put a
bunch of dumb people into a system
and then get a good result but it does
it's a sort of a self-correcting
system at the very least it gives you a
credible outcome even if it's not a good
one
so those are good systems also the
justice system is good because you can
take ordinary citizens with all of their
defects
uh put them on a trial on a jury
and you generally get pretty credible
results
so those are three systems that we've
had great experience with putting
defective humans into them and still
it sort of self corrects which is
amazing
if you think about it
i mean how hard is it to correct the
system
where you put garbage in and you get
gold out
i just told you three of them
we have three major systems where we can
feed it garbage and it turns into gold
we can feed his stupidity and it turns
into reasonably good decisions
compared to the alternatives
lots of problems of course but
kind of amazing
now contrast that to social media
take a bunch of flawed human beings
and give them a social media accounts
does the social media act like these
other systems and take these flawed
humans and sort of over time
correct for their excesses
no it does the opposite
it exacerbates them
so social media is a system that takes
the flaws of humans and accelerates them
it it exacerbates them
am i right so the system is not by
design per se but where it evolved to
is the opposite of a good system
and so rather than complaining i thought
i'd suggest
some ways to tweak it
so here are some ways we could tweak our
information getting systems so i'm going
to say that the news business plus
social media are collectively a system
for getting accurate information to the
public
so that system could be tweaked i would
i would recommend the following tweaks
because i don't think we need to go
through a legal constitutional process
to do this number one
stop calling anonymous sources anonymous
sources you can say that they're
anonymous
but instead of calling them anonymous
sources we should all agree to call them
unreliable sources
because they are
imagine the news
if every time they had an anonymous
source they tell you it's anonymous
because that's just part of the story
but they also say
and based on this unreliable uh source
they should call them unreliable
right
wouldn't that help
it just as a standard for social media
and a standard for the news
to simply say that if something is
anonymous the sources it is also by
definition unreliable
somebody says unverifiable
uh that's not good enough
not good enough unverifiable is true and
maybe even more accurate but it's not
good enough i think you have to go all
the way to unreliable
because we've had so much trouble with
it
if we never had trouble with it i would
go with unverifiable
because that just sits there
but unreliable
does more work unreliable says we've had
trouble with this in the past why
wouldn't we have trouble in the future
right
uh unverified might not be a problem you
just don't know one way or the other but
this is definitely a problem so go with
unreliable
secondly and this one will take you some
thinking all right you might not
instantly embrace this
we could agree we meaning the public and
the press and everybody else we could
agree to ignore claims
any claim
that is not in close proximity to the
fact check
or the criticisms now what do i mean by
close proximity well twitter is a good
example
if i tweet something that's false
in very close proximity there will be
almost guaranteed
a tweet right below at a comment that
says no you're wrong here's the fact
check
so i think tw twitter is a reasonably
good
mechanism
for information
so long as you read the comments
right so we should agree to read the
comments
because and that's that model the claim
and the counter claim are right next to
each other they're in close proximity
that doesn't make you smart
but at least it's a good system
now compare that to
the joe rogan model of interviewing one
expert for three hours
if that expert talks for three hours and
covers all kinds of different topics
it is as far away as you can get
from the fact check
or the the criticisms or the counter
claims
so my problem with the joe rogan model
is that it's great entertainment
obviously it's hugely successful
it is informative
definitely informative
but
we should be smarter consumers and we
should treat that as entertainment
if you came away from the joe rogan show
and said i learned some new things about
science
you shouldn't
what you should do is say i watched an
entertaining program with a doctor who
said some things
that counter the mainstream narrative
that's all you did
you didn't get any information
to get information you would need the
claim and the counter claim to be in
close proximity
and then and only then
could you say i learned a new thing
because i saw the claim i looked at the
counter claim and i decided that the
claim was stronger than the counter
claim
mark is saying scott's telling us what
to think
mark you are officially too dumb to be
on this live stream
because could the rest of you uh confirm
that i'm not telling you what to think
but rather
the technique for thinking and systems
so mark you're officially too dumb to be
a member of this conversation you will
now be banned
to loserdom
as i hide you on this channel
telling you what to think i don't know
why you're watching
anyway
i do not have all the answers for how to
fix our information systems but uh but i
i put out some ideas
and it i would recommend that we that we
sort of
promote a standard that says if it's
anonymous it's also unreliable and we
should always say that
and that if it's a claim that's not in
close proximity to fact checkers is just
entertainment
it could be valuable and it could give
you information
but you should not
use it for decision making
you should not use it for decision
making does anybody agree with that
standard
because it doesn't say anything good or
bad about dr malone
it just says that in that format
you you've got some entertainment and
some information but not the kind you
can use
right you've got information but here's
the key not the kind you could use
until you see the counter claims
and then maybe maybe
so there might be some other ways to go
about this
anyway
um
uh i offered on twitter because there
are a lot of uh supporters of dr malone
and i said this uh i'll make you a deal
i will watch the entire three-hour joe
rogan interview with dr malone i've
already started so i'm part way through
it i'll watch the entire three hours
but i would like you or or
most of you
to look at the
fact check
on dr malone the claims that
apparently got him kicked off of twitter
i'll talk about those in a minute
and
i'm just asking you to look at the
counter claims
so i will agree
to go through three hours of that
content i've already started i'm just
going to ask you to look at the counter
claims
now
did i just tell you that the counter
claims are the correct ones
did you hear that
i hope you didn't
because i'm going to tell you that at
least one of the counter claims
is really
all right
so we're going to we're going to talk
about the counter claimers also having
some issues the fact checkers
also some issues so what i'm asking you
is always look at the fact check as well
as the data i'm not telling you in this
case that the fact check is the
believable one
i mean it is but
that's not that's not today's topic
i'll tell you honestly that i looked at
the fact checks and i looked at the
claims and the fact checks do look
stronger than the claims
but how can we judge
right if you're not an expert in any of
that stuff how can you judge
but one of the one of the fact checks
did look like we'll talk about
that
all right
pretty soon i will uh see if i can get
kicked off of social media now the idea
was uh the
the bet
that i'm taking here and i'll we'll get
to this
is that
um social media
is supporting one narrative and
suppressing another how many of you
would say that that would be true of
these two topics
the 2020 election integrity
and vaccine safety
how many of you would say that the the
official narratives are being promoted
but any alternative narratives
uh people are getting kicked off now i
want to make a
i want to make a distinction between the
algorithms
which might you know debust things and
boost others can we all agree that the
algorithms
appear
to choose some narratives over others
would we all agree with that
that our lived experience
it sure feels like it
i mean i've seen lots of examples many
of them
many of the examples i've seen didn't
hold up to scrutiny
but
i mean you can smell it and feel it
it just feels like it couldn't be
anything but that right
now i would i would say that even the
social media companies would admit
they would admit
that they support the
the approved narrative if science
seems to support it by consensus
so you should see exactly that you
should see the official narrative get
more boost
because the social media companies tell
you that directly
we're going to boost the things we think
are
true and have credibility according to
them
maybe not to you
but according to them so
so let's not have any disagreement
today about whether the algorithms
are biased
we'd all accept that right
even if they're biased with good
intention
that part is debatable
but there's no question that they're
biased toward the official narrative
which the social media companies believe
is actually true and helpful and useful
so
the thought is that if anybody goes
against the narrative on social media
they will be banned let me give an
example marjorie taylor green was
permanently suspended by twitter
here are some things she said
apparently she
included a misleading oh she said that
on saturday she tweeted falsely they say
the claim is that this is false
uh that there are quote extremely high
amounts of covet vaccine deaths and then
she included a uh what what is called by
the fact checkers a misleading chart
that showed information from a
government database the various database
you all know about that
now the varus database is not
confirmed problems but rather
suspected or possible
problems
and it has a lot of activity with the
recent vaccinations
so new york times is fact checking her
on that's as as did twitter saying that
that vera's database
is a decades-old system that relies on
self-reporting and so when marjorie
taylor green showed that that was
evidence of of latikova deaths
that
she had to get kicked off
but is anything missing from this story
do you know what i would have liked to
see in this new york times story
i would like to them to say
what is normal for a vaccine rollout
does the vera's database
normally get this much attention
or
is the fact that the vares database if
it is i don't know if this is even true
if if the vars database has more reports
let's say you know by a factor of 10 and
i have no reason to believe that's true
but just hypothetically
would the new york times have some
obligation to tell you
no you cannot rely on the varus database
for certainty
but when it's
and again this is hypothetical but when
it's ten times as big as any other
vaccine that was rolled out that's not
true that's these are hypotheticals
uh
it's notable
don't you think the new york times
is selling a narrative as opposed to
doing a fact check
because i think if it were a fact check
they say yes it's true
that there is an alarming number of
reports in the vares database
but you must understand
that the pandemic is getting a lot of
attention and there might be some over
reporting possible there might be some
under reporting
possible
so although you should not take it as
the final word
if the vers database reporting is
way out of line with what one might
expect
that should be taken as a signal
to you know research more reliable data
that's what a fact check would look like
this wasn't a fact check
and by the way i'm not supporting
marjorie taylor green's interpretation
because i think she too
should have softened her uh her
assertions to
what we know to be true
now i would say that this is case of
marjorie taylor green being misleading
on a health related topic
wouldn't you
uh would you disagree
that if marjorie taylor green showed you
the vares database without also giving
you the context
that it can't be relied on
you know as the final award
that that would be misleading
but is it more misleading than the fact
check
it is not
it is not more misleading than the fact
check the fact check is plenty
misleading
so you might say to yourself wait a
minute
why did marjorie taylor green get kicked
off for being misleading but the new
york times
doesn't even get criticized
for being misleading in the other way
by leaving out some context
um
here's another thing that marjorie
taylor green was hit with she had five
strikes according to twitter
um
let's see she told you uh
what was the other thing she said
uh
so she she had tweeted that kovid 19 was
not dangerous that was one of them
and she fought according to the new york
times she quote falsely posted that the
vaccines were failing
so she one of her one of her strikes is
that she said the vaccines were failing
quote failing
doesn't that depend what your standard
for success was
if your standard for success was
stopping the pandemic
well
i think she's right
because it didn't stop the spread as
much as we hoped it would
but if the topic is does it keep you
from dying
the data suggests strongly yes so that
case you would be very wrong
but again there's a little context
missing here but i would agree that the
way she
approached it
could be considered
false and dangerous
okay
and by the way i'm going to give you a
stronger argument than marjorie taylor
greene
about the safety
risks of vaccines
and then we'll see if i get kicked off
because i'm going to use her as my model
i'm going to make a stronger claim than
she's making but i won't use what uh
what i consider false data to do it or
misleading data okay
so my my assertion is
that you do not get banned by social
media
if you tell things if you tell the truth
so that's the test so i'm only going to
tell the truth but my case against
against getting vaccinated will be
stronger
than the person who got kicked off
do you think i could do that
we'll see
in a related topic rasmussen and i
haven't seen this anywhere else and i
don't know why but rasmussen
was tweeting
the rasmussen reports were tweeting
that apparently the 2020 arizona
election
audits
found a number 10 different types of
paper
used on the ballots
there is only one that is approved
now i'm not sure any of this information
is true
do you believe that we really found in
maricopa county
ten different papers for ballots and
that that has been confirmed
and that only one kind of paper is
approved
do you believe
that i'm going to say i don't believe it
but
if it is true
we've got some questions
so let's keep an eye on that i don't
know why this isn't a bigger story even
if uh
maybe there is there a fact check on
this i guess i should have checked so
here's here's a perfect example where
um i need to go back to the comments and
see if somebody did a fact check on this
i would say that i have trouble
believing that there were 10 different
types of paper used
because even if fraud were involved
would they use 10 different pieces of
paper
10 different types
if fraud were involved at this level i
mean this would be somewhat
sophisticated
i would figure that they would at least
use one type of fake paper
really i mean so there's something about
this that doesn't it doesn't pass the
sniff test
but
um rasmussen reports has not been kicked
off of twitter
right
because they reported something that's
uh
true in terms of it's truly being
reported
i mean well let me say i don't know if
the if the
fact about the paper is true
but it's being reported so that's true
so rasmussen did not say anything that
is false they reported what's being
reported
didn't get kicked off
and i think i can do the same
so i'm going to give you also
a stronger argument
against the idea that the election was
credible
than any that i think anybody's given
yet
and i will not be kicked off of social
media i predict
because i won't say anything that isn't
true
so here's the line i don't believe you
get kicked off of social media for
saying things that are true and are
easily demonstrably true
i believe that the only people getting
kicked off are actually saying things
that are really misleading
now that doesn't mean the fact checkers
are right don't get me wrong but we'll
test my theory
um
all right so
let me uh violate the narrative a little
bit
you ready
here's my we'll start with the elections
there have been many claims of election
fraud
they have been either
rejected or they weren't big enough to
make a difference so as we stand today
there are no court
proven
examples of fraud in 2020 that were big
enough to have changed the result
right
now having said that
there's almost nothing i can say after
that that would get me banned from
social media
that's my belief
because because i said a true thing
that
there's no no court has found any kind
of fraud in that election
big enough that would make any
difference
now
i'm going to argue against that
narrative
the strongest argument that you've ever
heard
there is no such thing as a system that
is very important
in other words has a high dollar value
or social value or
let's say
the
the government value
there's no such thing as a system that's
high value
that can't be fully audited and that's
the situation with our elections they
can't be fully audited you can you can
look at little
parts of them
but we don't have a mechanism at all
to fully audit any election
because you can't get into the
electronic part
so if you can't audit it
and it's a big system that means a lot
and that the uh the uh the stakes are
very high
the odds of that system becoming
fraudulent are 100
over time
the only thing we don't know about 2020
is if the level of fraud has yet reached
the point where it changes election
results
it will
100
it will
rose
i have some advice for you rose says i'm
getting a bit tedious lately
and rose um
i would recommend
that you go yourself
and instead of watching this
alright
so
check check my assertion
my assertion is that there is 100 chance
our election system
is already moving in a fraudulent
direction is guaranteed to be fraudulent
in a way that would check
that would change election results we
just don't know if it happened yet or it
will happen next
i think that's the strongest argument
and did i say anything that's not
obviously true
anything
did i
give
you tell me
is that the strongest argument
against election integrity
using things we know to be true
now did i say anything that wasn't true
no no
nothing i said about that is untrue
will i be banned from social media for
saying what i just said the strongest
argument so far
against election integrity no not even a
chance because nobody would listen to
what i said and say oh i disagree
there's literally nothing to disagree in
my opinion and it violates the narrative
completely
the narrative is if you didn't find any
fraud it's fine
i couldn't have i could not have
violated that narrative any stronger
now let's do vaccines
this may be the last 10 minutes you ever
see me
according to you
i believe i'll be safe because i'm not
going to say anything that isn't untrue
all right let's say it
so dr malone got uh kicked off of uh
twitter for some claims i i would
recommend that you look at the fact
check i tweeted it so you can see it in
my twitter feed andre's back house found
it and i'm not saying that the fact
check is correct
i'm saying
i'm saying you should look at it if
you've looked at dr malone's claims
but here's one of the things that the
fact checker said when talking about dr
malone they said
i guess dr malone said that vaccines
could be dangerous for children in
some situations
um
but
they quote some they quote malone as
saying in summary
there's no benefit for your children or
your family to be vaccinating your
children against small risks of the
virus the risk benefit analysis is not
even close with this vaccine for
children so that's the claim that got
him or i think one of them that got him
his twitter ban
so the claim is there's no benefit no
benefit not some no benefit for your
children or your family to be
vaccinating your children
against the small risks of the virus
and the risk benefit is not even close
now the the fact checkers talk to three
doctors
and they don't tell us who those doctors
are
wait a minute they talked to three
doctors to do a fact check
and those doctors are anonymous sources
oh so the fact check is using unreliable
sources for a fact check
because they're anonymous
right
that should be the standard they're
unreliable sources so what do the
unreliable sources say about dr malone's
claim
uh given that dr malone is a reliable
source
wouldn't you say if somebody's an expert
they give you you give you their name
they go on video
they clearly explain their point of view
they could be right or they could be
wrong
but is dr malone a credible person
yes yes doesn't mean he's right
it means he's highly credible
are the doctors who fact-checked him
credible
no we don't know who they are
we don't know if they have his
credentials
so we have an unreliable group
fact-checking a reliable
entity
doesn't mean one of them is right and
one was wrong that's just the situation
now here's what they say
the three doctors said quote the
theoretical risk of coven vaccines
absolutely do not
outweigh the benefits of the vaccine
said greenhouse
i actually one of the doctors might have
their name in there
so if their names are there then fact
check me then then it's not it's less
unreliable if their names are in there
so
what do you think
uh do you believe that dr malone is
right
that the
costs outweigh the benefits or do you
think the fact-checking doctors are
right or three of them three of them
they say it's the opposite
go who's right
who's right the fact-checking doctors or
the fact-checking doctor malone
the answer is it is unknowable
because nobody knows the long-term risks
of the vaccination and nobody knows the
long-term risk
of covet
am i right
nobody knows the long-term risk of the
vaccination especially
boosted
especially
mixed
if you're crossfading with your
vaccinations check with your teens to
see what i just said that won't make any
sense to you if you know anybody who's a
teenager say that you're watching this
live stream the cartoon has said don't
cross-fade with your vaccines and
they'll laugh and then they'll explain
what that meant but i'm not going to
tell you right now so if you mix two
different vaccines together who tested
that
nobody
who tested the the booster
i don't know that the boosters have been
around long enough to test them who
tested the second and third booster
on children
nobody
how can dr malone say that the cost
benefit
is bad and these doctors can say the pos
cost benefit is very good when neither
dr malone nor the critics have any
 idea what the risks are
am i wrong
neither of these entities who are
arguing with a high degree of certainty
have any data that would support either
of their opinions
am i wrong
these are two experts who are trying to
bamboozle the public into thinking that
they can make
really certain decisions with no no data
with no data
no data on the long-term effects are we
worried about the short-term risks
is that the big concern the short-term
risk in other words the first
few months well that's that's been
tested
have some of you seen
some data that said that
there's secretly but we didn't know it
until recently
that the vaccines caused a lot of harm
to people in the first
first weeks
has anybody seen that
it's debunked right yeah is it look for
the debunk
if you see that just look for the debunk
it's it's completely debunked
now
you could argue that the debunk isn't
good but it's a pretty strong one
so as far as i know
to the best of my knowledge there is no
there's no credible information
to say that there's a short-term risk
with the vaccines
oh well let me get that right there's no
credible information
that the short-term risk
is higher than the
short-term gain
now but it also doesn't go the other way
you know i don't think you can prove
it's safe
but there's no evidence about the long
term and especially with boosters
because they can't you can't study the
future
so here's the strongest argument against
vaccine safety
and here will be my last minute on
twitter if many of you are right
that violating the narrative is all it
takes
so i'm going to violate the narrative
but i'm not going to tell a lie okay
number one the pharma industry is known
to be wildly corrupt
agree
the pharma industry is known
to be wildly corrupt not a little bit
corrupt
not average corrupt i'm talking food
industry corrupt
like that's the highest standard i think
the highest standard of corruption is
the food industry but
but in that neighborhood is pharma all
right so we have a drug that's created
by
an industry i'm not talking about a
specific company now necessarily but
created by an industry we know to be
just full of corruption and the kind of
corruption where they will kill you for
profits am i right
it's the kind of corruption where they
will actually kill you
to make money and that there are lots of
examples of this
okay so we have a vaccine from a source
that cannot be trusted
we have data that we
don't
trust i don't know if it's good or bad
data but i could tell you we don't trust
it because we don't trust any data
especially from an industry that's known
to be corrupt
we know that the money involved in
vaccines is gigantic and we know that
money corrupts
if money corrupts what does a trillion
dollars do
if money corrupts a trillion dollars
guarantees corruption
it removes all
doubt right now that assumes there's an
opportunity and a reason to be corrupt
if the vaccines work great
nobody had to do any corruption right
but if there was any possibility that
corruption would give
somebody an advantage
a trillion dollars or two will get you
there fast
so we've got a corrupt industry
rushed a product that was not tested in
the
long-term sense
because you know you can't test the
future
uh we know that the money is huge and
that always corrupts things when there's
opportunity we don't know if there's an
opportunity to corrupt but it would if
there were
we know that fauci who's the voice of
all of our pandemic requirements is a
confirmed liar
so our main our main source of this
information that we should take vaccines
is a confirmed liar and he's a confirmed
liar on this topic
which is the pandemic
because he lied about masks
and then he told us he lied
now he gave us the reason and i think
the reason actually
wasn't terrible
but whether or not he had a good reason
is a little bit separate
from the question of do we know that the
main
mouthpiece for this
is a liar and the answer is yes
he admitted it
so you've got a
industry you can't
trust they're known to be liars they
will kill you for money the money is
huge money always corrupts we don't know
the long-term risks and the person who
is the
spokesperson for this is a known liar
admitted liar
and when you read the fact check from
these doctors
they're either stupid or lying to you or
persuading
because when they say that they
absolutely know that the risks of two
unknowns
can be assessed
oh this unknown is way bigger than this
unknown
no that's not a thing you can't compare
two unknowns and then be sure which is
the big one i mean not in this context
there would be context in which you
could do that but not this one
because the the risk is that you die
right so uh
well enough about that
so
um
why would you give your child a
vaccination
that came from a corrupt industry that
you know would be corrupt is corrupted
by money went through the fda that you
know is corrupt by the way you know the
fda is corrupt because of the
rapid testing scandal we don't know the
details
but i think you have to assume
corruption
because they never even explained
they never even explained why we don't
have as many rapid tests as we should
that's a clear signal of corruption
without actual proof right
so we've got a corrupt fda a corrupt
industry making vaccinations that they
rushed
funneled through a corrupt government
with a lying fouchy
uh and
doctors telling us even today that they
can determine which of the unknown risks
is the bigger risk
the unknown risks and they're telling us
those are the big risks
seriously
seriously
all right
now
have i achieved my standard
of violating the narrative
have i
you tell me have i violated the
narrative because that's that's the test
if i don't violate the narrative then
this is not a test
right most of you say yes
all right so
you know this is not the kind of test
you can satisfy everybody somebody's
going to say you didn't violate it
enough because you didn't make a claim
about some data that you think is true
that i don't
but
i think this is the strongest argument
that literally everybody involved is a
liar
that's the summary
literally
everyone everyone involved
from the drug makers through the fda
through the government through fouchy to
the fact checkers
to the new york times
everyone is lying
and obviously
now i'm not saying everybody's lying on
every point
i'm just saying it's a nest of proven
liars
and you're being asked to put a drug
into your body
that was developed and promoted by known
liars
now
on top of that we have the omicron
situation
now suppose you knew that the omicron
virus had the characteristics we're told
it has mild illness and such a rapid
spread that you can forget about your
mass because your mask is going to help
you a bit
i still think masks
probably helped
with delta and alpha
because mask reduced the plume
and the plume is where all the viral
load is so if you if you didn't do
anything except reduce the plume
probably could have helped don't know
for sure but probably could have helped
with delta and alpha
but if what they're telling us about
omicron is true
you know a little particle that escapes
from the side of your mask is going to
affect the whole room
right because just any exposure seems to
be enough with the omicron
so
in the context of
vaccines which cannot be
assessed for their risk long term
can't be with an omicron that's going to
do what omicron does which is it's going
to sweep through in about the next two
weeks
doesn't it make more sense to wait
would the smart person wait to see what
happens with omicron or would they get
another booster
well
i'm waiting on my booster
i don't imagine that i would even
consider a booster until after february
1st
and then it's sort of a see what's
happening are there any other variants
do we know anything else about the thing
you know have we learned anything that
we don't know now
but
i don't think that your officials are
being honest with you about the
potential benefits of
the
the omicron
secondly and lastly i have been
criticized for not saying enough about
the social costs
of lockdowns and mandates how many of
you would agree with that statement
that i have not said enough
about the social costs
and health costs of and health costs
especially the children of all the the
shutdowns do you think so
uh that may be a valid criticism
i think that's a valid criticism but
i'll tell you why i haven't
because i think it's just obvious
i tend to ignore the obvious
because you don't need to be told the
obvious
and the obvious is there's a real big
problem
with mandates
and we don't know how to size it
but it's obvious and it's real big i
just don't think i need to tell you that
every time i talk about the topic it's
to me that would be like uh let me
explain this baseball game how that went
first you need to know that there's
oxygen
and so all the players had oxygen they
were breathing i don't have to tell you
that there's oxygen
that part you already knew you're living
it you're breathing the oxygen
likewise you're you're breathing the
the mandates
depending where you are
so um i believe i will be demonetized
uh on youtube
by the way if there's somebody who can
uh
text me right now and tell me if i've
already been demonetized i'm not sure if
you can tell but i imagine i'll get
demonetized
because that would change you know the
the algorithm
but i predict that i will not
be
i don't think i'll get a strike
nor do i think i'll be banned from
social media because as far as i know
everything i said was true
and would be easy to demonstrate
have i made my point
yes it's true that i can do this i can
do this kind of a test and you can't
because if i got kicked off of social
media i would just retire
i would just retire and i'd be pretty
happy actually you'd be fine
um so i don't have the risk that you
have but i so i can run this test
you have to tweet it somebody says
do i
i don't know
do i have to tweet it i mean i'll tweet
these
this content gets tweeted
try this try taking me uh try quoting me
and then tweeting it
because you'll probably misquote me and
that'll get me in real trouble
um
i thought that was going to be my answer
just waiting to see if i'm already
demonetized
oh not yet
yeah so i'm not yet demonetized on on
youtube i guess if you challenge them
and tell them it's a contest they they
get a little more serious i get
demonetized almost automatically on a
lot of my content but then upon review
it gets reversed
all right
um somebody says i'm not i'm not elected
and i'm not an expert in the field that
is correct
are there any people who have been
banned from social media
for misinformation about the election or
for covent
who were not elected and not experts
i think the answer is yes right yeah
alex berenson
yeah alex berenson right so i think the
test still stands because i have a
prominent
account with a lot of uh
uh crowder yeah crowder
dave rubin he got he got a strike right
naomi wolf she got a strike
trump well trump was elected
uh
all right
so
the uh here's the bottom line assuming
that i'm still here today or still here
tomorrow and i don't get banned
my claim has been this
i want you to make better arguments when
you agree with me
i don't like to be on the same side as
people
whose arguments for my own opinion
are bad arguments
i think it's a bad argument
that people are being banned for saying
true things on twitter
because i don't think it's happening
i mean and if it happens i think
sometimes they get reversed
on appeal or whatever but i don't think
that's the big problem
i think the big problem is the way
people are saying it
in other words the marjorie taylor green
i think she could have easily avoided
being banned if when she tweeted the
varis database she simply said
you know this should not be taken as the
final word or it's an indication or it's
a red flag
something like that if she just said it
was a red flag
i'm pretty sure she would not be banned
because that's true
yes words matter
all right um
i believe uh this is the best live
stream i've ever done
if it's not the last one
and uh i'd like to
check with you
check with you on that
uh was my discussion of the mass
formation formation psychosis useful
did it give you any new insight and
did i
did i make my claiming you can't be 100
on any of this that it's probably the
inaccuracy that's getting people booted
off of twitter
for the most part i know you can find an
exception but i don't think there's a
an organized effort
to ban people who say true things
just because they don't like the
narrative i don't think that exists
there's i do think
you have to worry about the algorithm
you know like suppressing this or
suppressing other things that's
different but remember youtube hasn't
demonetized me and generally sp at least
yet and if they don't demonetize things
that usually keeps it pretty high in the
algorithm it's the demonetized stuff
that gets pushed down
so we'll test it now you could also if
you want to go deep into the conspiracy
you could say well scott they knew you
were testing it
they were watching you
they knew you were testing it so you
know they didn't they didn't do it
uh let's talk about china for a moment
before i go
apparently uh they got some big problems
over there
have you noticed
so let me ask you this did you know that
in
the chinese culture
that karma is a is a big thing
how many of you knew that and let me can
i have a confirmation please
some of you might be chinese-american or
even chinese
can you give me a a confirmation on that
that karma
is a
cultural
it's a cultural thing
in china
i think it came from the confucius
stuff or maybe from i don't know
but
uh okay so uh i have a confirmation from
somebody who is chinese who says yes
karma is a big thing
now
what happens when china
who is being criticized for its
treatment of the uyghurs
is certainly being criticized for the
release of the
virus
is being criticized for a whole number
of things
that look abusive that look like bad
behavior
and at the same time
china is having a lot of bad luck
so they've got some economic problems
they've got
uh probably they're going to have
a big problem with the omicron olympics
i think they're going to have an omicron
breakout
now
how long will it take
before the chinese citizens start to
believe
that the bad luck they're experiencing
as a country is related to the bad
things that they're doing to other
people
meaning the uyghurs
and how hard will it be to connect
those two thoughts
because i'm doing it right now
if you live in china
and you think your government is
creating a bad karma for you
through the treatment of the uyghurs
and that what's happening to you is
maybe the curse of the uyghurs
and that every time something bad
happens in china that may have any cause
it has nothing to do with the uyghurs i
believe i will be labeling that
the curse of the uyghurs
now
if it turns out that the chinese public
or even the chinese leadership
are
superstitious
it will be kind of a vexing idea
to connect the uyghur treatment with all
the bad luck that happens seemingly in
unrelated ways
it's almost the kind of idea that could
take down a government
because if the people in china get it in
their head
that it's not a coincidence
that china is having this unbroken
string of bad luck
at the same time that they're
mistreating the uyghurs
at the same time that the public has a
great belief in karma
i think we should
enforce that idea
or reinforce it
and so
going forward if you see any stories
that look like bad things happened in
china
be sure to tweet them with the hashtag
wieger kramer karma
uyghur you have to look up the spelling
i have to look up the spelling of uyghur
every time i use it
every time i can't tell you how many
times i wanted to tweet something about
the uyghurs and i didn't feel like
looking up the correct spelling so i
just like ah get back to it
so
yeah
the uyghurs are causing a karma problem
in china
and
as long as china comes to believe that
which they will
maybe something good can happen
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you all
tomorrow
