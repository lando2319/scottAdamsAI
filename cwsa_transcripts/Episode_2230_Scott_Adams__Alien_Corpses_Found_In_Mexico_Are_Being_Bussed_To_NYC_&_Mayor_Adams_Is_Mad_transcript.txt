oh love
looking at some pictures that are well
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I'm told that aliens are coming from far
away just to be here for this
and if you'd like your experience to go
up a level that nobody even imagined was
possible all you need is a cover mug or
a glass of Tanked your jealous is dying
the canteen jug of flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
and the day the thing makes everything
better it's called simultaneous sip go
oh that's good
that's good
ladies and gentlemen
today I believe the podcast
called trigonometry will be featuring me
so look for that I think it dropped
today you'll be amazed and delighted
or entertained or something by the way
how many of you have bought the best
book in the world
for a gift
it turns out I accidentally wrote the
best gift book in the world reframe your
brain
because after you read it and it changes
your life you can give it to other
people and it changes their life
you know I was trying to think who it
would not be suitable for
and I couldn't think of anybody you know
below maybe the age of 14 or something
maybe not so much but above the age of
14 there's literally nobody in the world
who shouldn't get this book as a gift
because it's that useful
but everybody who's read it has already
learned that that's why it's it's by far
the most gifted book in the world
I would say I could say that with ease
all right so here's what's going on uh
some late shows are trying to come back
without writers because the writers
strike
now how are they going to do it how in
the world I mean they say they're going
to do it by being you know spontaneous
and not having written pieces but how in
the world would anybody do a show like
multiple times per week
with our professional writers how how is
that even possible how could it be done
that somebody could do a show without
professional writers
is called a podcast a podcast
it's what literally every podcast does
for an hour every time
in fact there's no podcast that can't do
that
they can all do an hour of talking to a
guest or two or No guest at all in my
case how hard is that turns out not very
hard if you have talent
but the Late Show people are trying to
work it out trying to figure out how do
we do a show without professional
writers
I can't imagine
all right my favorite story of the day
and there's so many to pick from is uh
representative Lauren bobert
I got kicked out of a Denver Beetlejuice
performance for what they call
disruptive behavior
now there were no details on what her
disruptive behavior
was alleged to have been there is only
security footage
of her walking all the way out from you
know where she was asked to leave in the
audience all the way down the halls and
up the stairs and around the corners
they had lots and lots of video footage
so we could get a pretty good idea
what it was about representative bobert
that was quote disruptive
I don't know about you but if you saw
the dress she was wearing it felt a
little disruptive to me if you know what
I mean in my pants
yes it turns out that uh representative
bobert has a an impressive set of
headlights
that she was showcasing and I addressed
that
could only be could only be made more
flattering if viewed from the angle of
the security cameras
looking directly down on her
so all the news is all the news is we're
pretending that the news isn't looking
at our tits which were quite impressive
I must say
now if I were going to add a political
character to the Dilbert comic strip
Universe what would that character's
name be
hmm
you got a Dilbert a ratbert a cat Bert
a bobert I think I might add her to the
comic strip because I need a politician
yeah she'll be a gun Toten
bobert
maybe maybe not
well hey was anybody worried that the
the economy is in trouble
I was I you know until this morning
I honestly I was a little bit worried
about our economy you know what with the
debt and the inflation and stuff like
that but I am told that Economist uh
Krugman you've heard of Krugman
economist
yeah he says
Not only was I wrong about how bad it
was
but I was sort of doubly wrong I mean
listen to how we're all guy was I mean
I'm mocking myself now because you know
I've got a degree in economics and I was
so wrong I was so wrong so here's what I
should have been thinking this is from
Krugman
um Paul gregman he says quote the
economic data have been severely good
wow so really it's a really good
see if I were to rank that let's say
there would be good less than good uh
better than good
and then it's a really good that's
that's a really good
oh how good is it oh it's really good
it's really good yeah so it's a really
good
uh and he goes on well he's not done yet
even optimists are just stunned
optimistic well I don't know that does
that sound like hyperbole are the
optimists all stunned
I mean I consider myself an optimist
am I stunned well let's see what else
so why do polls show most Americans
don't think the economy is doing well
there's a really profound and peculiar
disconnect going on
weird
it's weird that the people who can't
afford groceries
don't know that they really can
well what's wrong with them
let's see what the inflation rate is
because I'm an optimist it's a 3.7
okay what happened
was I stunned for a moment
I am an optimist I feel like I was
stunned
how long have I been out
is today still Wednesday
I don't know what's going on
well I'm stunned stunned and unconscious
because that
economy is so so good I'm stunned
so in case you thought it was bad it's
not
so there's a supporter of Joe Biden who
tells you it's pretty pretty good
well the impeachment inquiry is a go not
the impeachment known to no don't don't
confuse the impeachment inquiry with an
impeachment
if there's anything I can teach you it's
that the inquiry and the impeachment are
completely different
so the inquiry is to find out if there's
enough to impeach
sort of you might think of it like a
grand jury
would that be a good analogy
the grand jury to the impeachment
inquiry
because the trial would be like the
impeachment
and the the indictment the grand jury
indictment process would be sort of like
an inquiry oh is there enough here well
we don't know but it looks like there's
a suggestion of a hint of enough
so you better look into it
so your news sources will be trying to
confuse you continuously about the
difference between an impeachment
inquiry and an impeachment one of the
ways they'll do it is that the left will
say things like there's no evidence
there's no direct evidence in fact there
is a uh oh let's let's call it the the
hoax well
have I ever told you about the hoax well
when people started at the top and they
say x is totally true and then you show
them it's not true
and then they go well X is not true but
you know Y is certainly true and then he
showed that's not true well X and Y are
not true that's for sure but how about Z
you know they'll just keep going down
the well
so here's the evolution
of the Biden let's say defenses
it started with
Biden did nothing wrong
Biden did nothing wrong there was
nothing wrong
so that was that was uh the beginning
and then it turns into there's no
evidence Biden did anything wrong that's
a little different isn't it one is a
statement that you know for sure that
nothing happened
but you softened it a little bit by
saying well you know nobody can know
what they don't know
but you know is there any direct is
there any evidence is there any evidence
and then when it was shown that there
was plenty of evidence
it changed to
but is it Direct
okay yeah it's not really Direct
sure it's your circumstantially sort of
indirect
in the domain of in the general zip code
of
what is a direct
well then we're we're now past there's
no direct evidence
but now as uh as CNN put it today
and I quote
there is a lack of impeachment evidence
oh
so we're not only moving away from
anything wrong
and we're not only moving away from well
there's no evidence of anything wrong
and we've moved away from well there's
no direct evidence of anything wrong
and now we're at there's no direct
evidence of anything that's impeachable
because you know why it might not be
impeachable
technical reasons because it might be
behavior that happened prior to being
president
which CNN's making a point of and I'm
not sure that's a terrible is that a bad
defense
seems pretty relevant to me
but could you say that if somebody took
money from China and Ukraine right
before they were president
that that has no that has no bearing on
the actual being of president now
well let's just say there's no evidence
that it would make a difference no I
mean there's no direct evidence
that any of that would make a difference
to his current performance on the job
and by that I mean not no direct
evidence I mean no Direct
impeachable evidence and by that I mean
the process hasn't started yet so they
haven't told us what the evidence is but
by that I mean there's really a mountain
of evidence that's pretty obvious
but is any of it impeachable well that's
what the that's what the process will
find out
now what
what is the most predictable thing
about the process
let's say if I were going to predict
where the impeachment inquiry will go
oh
I'm going to say that the impeachment
outcome will be a lot of alien corpses
and spaceships being found uh but hard
to verify hard to verify but lots of
them I wonder if anything like that's
happened in the news today
oh yeah
turns out they found alien corpses in
Mexico
a thousand years old
totally totally believable
now what they don't tell you about the
alien corpses that they found in Mexico
is that they're already being bussed in
New York City
and mayor Adams is complaining he's like
we cannot handle any more alien corpses
in New York City and then people are
like well you said you're a sanctuary
City and then he's like yeah but not for
space aliens we meant immigrants and
we're like oh so you're discriminating
now so I guess I guess there's some kind
of good aliens and then bad aliens is
what you're saying and that feels a
little bit you know
so
I for one am fully supportive of our
lgbtq
plus dead aliens D.A dead aliens
um and I think all of them should be
respected and they should all have a
sanctuary in New York City with with uh
my cousin Eric Adams
that's what I say
all right well uh
the great thing about uh
the impeachment process is that now that
you can see how the machine works and
what I mean by the machine is you can
see you know that the fact Checkers and
the Watchdogs are fake Democrat groups
and always have been really not always
but for in recent history that happened
you you can see how the news conforms to
whatever the White House tells them to
say
and here's a perfect example is Jonathan
Turley is pointing out
so there's this draft letter by the
Biden White House legal council
in which they're talking to the media
and telling the media to quote ramp up
their scrutiny of House Republicans
quote for opening an impeachment inquiry
based on lies
this is the Biden White House telling
the media how to report the story
and then CNN obeyed and reported the
story that way
like immediately uh
wow
so here again you can see the uh the
machine
so the machine is that the White House
tells the media how to report a story
and then the various Watchdogs will
report Republicans who have you know if
they have any pushback on that the ADL
will call them anti-semites
they don't need a reason they'll just
will the splc will say that it's a hate
group somebody who will tar them with
past associations I mean you see the
whole machine
and is it an accident that a
thousand-year-old aliens were discovered
at exactly the day the headlines
were about
something embarrassing to the the
Democrats kind of a big old coincidence
especially since we expect it
how many of you could have predicted
that the day the impeachment inquiry is
announced there would be a major UFO
story
was that predictable we all literally
predicted it
didn't we actually predict it out loud
I feel like we actually said it out loud
I don't remember if I said it but I feel
like it was in the atmosphere that
people were saying oh it's going to be
more UFO a lot more UFO sightings if
this impeachment thing gets going
people said that directly and that it
happened exactly on on cue
now am I wrong that we can all see the
gears of the machine now we can all see
that our you know our entities are
supposed to be protecting us are
apparently captured captured by the
industries they're supposed to be
regulated
and
I I loved Nancy Pelosi's answer to
slightly changed the subject to The
Insider training the members of Congress
do which is totally legal
and she said hey free market
it's totally legal to make investments
based on what you know in Congress that
the public doesn't yet know
she goes total free market totally legal
is there anything else you need to know
do you think the members of Congress
beat the average return of the S P 500
oh yeah oh yeah they did yes they did
all right um here's how Oliver Darcy of
CNN talks about this impeachment inquiry
now remember I've told you there are
designated liars and spinners
and there's some people who always go
first
when the narrative they're putting out
is a little bit ridiculous
and Oliver Darcy is one of those as soon
as you see his name it's like Colin
stefanson or Oliver Darcy you see those
two names you go oh okay this is going
to be the spinniest spin of all spins no
I'm not I'm not saying there's nobody on
the right who does the same thing I'm
just saying there's some names that you
immediately associate with you know not
a straight shooter
um so here he says uh they also talk
about the letter from the White House
that was
asking reporters to talk about it a
certain way and Darcy says the letter
which said an impeachment inquiry with
no supporting evidence should set off
alarm bells for news organizations
um so he's he's admitting that this
letter exists and what it says
um
and uh
and they referred to uh Oliver Darcy
refers to uh I have denied that disgrace
to former president Donald Trump
committed any wrongdoing so that you
talk about the Republicans have long
denied that quote disgraced former
president Donald Trump
disgraced
disgraced by whom
by CNN
to his supporters think he's disgraced
do you think there's any opinion in that
disgraced and and uh CNN's using the
trick that I always say that Alex Jones
and
um
uh Canada use which is just you sort of
State something as fact and then keep
going
yes he's disgrace president and let's
talk about something else just accept
the disgrace part would know with no
evidence uh but they say that but Darcy
goes on says that they're baselessly
portraying Biden as a corrupt
crime-ridden politician engaged in
Senator Sinister activities baselessly
do you think baselessly is still the
word you should be using
so we went from no direct evidence
to now baseless
what makes it baseless
that's a nice generic word isn't it
baseless
do you know what baseless does not
include
no evidence
so we've gone from no no evidence
nothing wrong to no evidence
to know direct evidence
to baseless
do you know what baseless does it allows
you to ignore some evidence
but you could say well there's evidence
but you know the evidence is baseless
too or it doesn't apply so you can go
from a mountain of evidence which is
actually what's what the reality is
there's there's a mountain of evidence
you've got emails you've got bank
records you've got testimony of people
who are there you've got the whole thing
so there couldn't I don't it's hard to
imagine now there could be more evidence
but you can call it baseless is that
what they called the laptop
did they call the laptop baseless as
well
baseless means that CNN itself is not
going to tell you it's true
baseless just means that other people
say it's true and CNN's not going to say
it's true
so
anyway
um
I don't know if I needed to tell you
that the aliens in Mexico are not real
does anybody think that the aliens in
Mexico are real corpses of aliens
anybody
huh
no
no and uh what's up with their elbows
I mean notice that their their bones are
connected
what what kind of an alien corpse has
you know if you were to find a human
would the front of the arm still be
connected to the back of the arm in a
thousand years
isn't this little connecting stuff
doesn't that all rot if you have two
separate bones oh but not the aliens
they're all connected they got a nice
clean little corpse all the parts are
intact
because I guess that's the way the Alias
rot totally different to the way the
people do
yeah yeah their bones were probably
fused by all of those uh rapid movements
in their ships that cannot be explained
by normal physics
yep Infuse their bones and then they
died and then we found them
that's probably what happened
all right
um do you own the do you all know Owen
schroyer I think he worked for
um
Alex Jones
and
he got three months in jail for not even
being on the capitol grounds
for January 6.
or something like that well whatever it
is it's something you wouldn't expect
somebody to go to jail for so would you
all agree that he's a political prisoner
that his conviction looks sketchy
I think every one of you right do you
think there's even one Democrat who even
knows his name or know that knows that
he's being
treated this way I'll bet there's not
one I'll bet you could walk down any
Street all day long and they would not
know they would not know that any of the
January 6 people
who were non-violent or even in jail
they wouldn't even know they certainly
would have never heard of uh Owen
Destroyer
and they certainly would not be aware of
the degree you know the extent of his
penalty for What Little he did
yeah
so this is amazing you know
did you ever think you would live in a
country where you have legitimate
political prisoners and it's being done
right in front of you
like I I didn't really ever think we
would ever get here
honestly I thought that was like Way
Beyond where America could ever slide to
but here we are
these are genuine political prisoners
now the next the next part of this is do
you is there an adjustment
does you know the the big test of
America is coming up
so America is not a country that makes
no mistakes
nobody would believe that right we're
not a country that makes no mistakes I
would say what identifies American
exceptionalism if I could just be a if I
could be a overly you know cringly
patriotic for anybody who's not American
watching this I know it feels
uncomfortable
it always feels uncomfortable watching
someone else's nationalism have you ever
noticed that
it feels a little bit like they're
defining themselves as separate from you
it feels a little creepy
right but one of the things I've always
appreciated about America is not that we
don't mess up because we do
but we're unusually good at correcting
we're unusually good at saying okay we
messed up we're idiots all right I'm an
idiot you're an idiot we're all stupid
idiots let's just do this better
and I'm not sure every every country can
do that
I think there's a different approach to
failure frankly I think that we fail
better than other countries like we fail
elegantly
do you remember when the first was the
first one or two SpaceX Rockets just
fell over and blew up like complete
failure
and now and now SpaceX has landed
Landing rockets and shooting them up
every day and planning for Mars now
that's an elegant failure
that that's a failure that's that's an
American failure because it was well we
learned from it and musk learned from it
it was enough to make it a success so
the failing is part of a it's an
American feature we fail harder and
faster and more elegantly
we sail more elegantly than anybody else
that's my claim
yeah and our entire entrepreneurial
startup culture is 95 failure pretty
quickly
but we make that work
so our startups work because we can fail
so aggressively and then just get up and
try again and fail some more until
something works
I'm not sure you can do that in China
I don't know that you could do that in
Japan
yeah we do have a just a huge advantage
in our let's say tolerance for a good
attempt
that's the best way to say it we have
maximum tolerance for a good try I just
don't know that that's everywhere
now so this is this brings me back to
our current situation I've never seen
the country in more dire
you know fascist looking situation then
I see now where the the party in power
does seem to be able to control the
media does seem to have control often
through ESG and Dei and other things on
corporations
and that's fascist by definition Glenn
Greenwald was pointing out
you know that uh MSNBC was fascist by
definition
because they were you know taking
instructions from you know the
government basically basically operating
like an arm of the government you know
classic fascism
now so here's the real question
are we going to be America
and correct it because that's what we do
what we do is we screw up and then we
correct it no matter how hard it is
because that's what we do
so that's what the election was is about
now normally if our elections were fair
and free and the media were not
corrupted
we would have a correcting mechanism
built into the system
there would be an election
the other party would win and then
they'd maybe create their own problems
have to be solved the next time but at
least they'd fix the current ones you
know maybe create a few more of Their
Own
but at the moment we don't have any uh
at least my audience we don't have a lot
of optimism that our elections or even
legitimate
is that a fair statement
would you in the comments is it fair to
say we don't we don't we don't
automatically assume it's legitimate
we don't know
but the not knowing is the problem
we also know we won't know next time
either
no matter what happens next we're not
going to know how would we know if it's
fair there's no mechanism for that
so this is different
so we don't just need to solve the
problem
we need to solve the entire mechanism
the machine
that got us to this point so we have to
re-engineer the machine
and you know are we going to be nimble
enough and smart enough and work hard
enough and take enough pain that we can
change the machine
well I would like to offer you this
following observation if you want some
optimism
have you noticed that some of the
strongest voices on at least social
media have something in common
there's something in common that the
so-called internet dads I like to use
that term seem to have in common
we've all been fired
canceled or disgraced
and you would say to yourself well that
certainly takes you off the field
or does it
or does it give you freedom of speech
or does it allow you to go to the mat
where otherwise you would have said I
got other things to do I'm not gonna I'm
not going to push this button any
further I'll get in trouble
but suppose you've already been gotten
you got in as much trouble as you could
possibly be in
what that
well I would argue that the system is
creating a
um a counter force that it didn't want
to create
meaning that the more people get
canceled the more freedom of speech they
get and the bigger Their audience
and so you're seeing now the sort of the
rise of the people describing the
machine
have you ever seen this before
you know that when I when I look at a
Glenn Greenwald tweet
he's usually describing the interplay of
the components of the machine
in a way that we didn't really even talk
about it when I was a kid so we've we've
moved from a what is the machine doing
you know where did it take us to how is
it built like how is this connected to
this other part of the machine
this is new
and it's because a lot of the people who
are the canceled people are also
unusually analytical
now I would put Elon Musk at the you
know the top of my list for somebody
they're trying to cancel as hard as
possible I mean he's got every
cancellation force on him
but he's also showing you how the
machine works that's what the X-Files
were right the the Twitter files they
were showing you how the machine works
and then he showed you that he
re-engineered the machine right in front
of you the machine being Twitter
now called ax but he he's in still in
the process of re-engineering it so that
the algorithm is not distorted
that's different
when you see a Mike cernovich tweet
is far more is far less likely to be
just some opinion and far more likely to
be opening the hood so you can see how
the gears are working and then you you
really get bad when you see the gears
when when I do my live streams I'm more
often talking about the mechanism than
the outcome
so so there's this whole Army of people
who have been exposed to seeing how the
whole Machine Works how hoaxes are
created so I've described to you maybe
as much as anybody has how a hoax is
created you know what a root bar is
right so here's here's the thing that's
forming
that I've never heard anybody talk about
which is there's an entire Army of
people being educated on how the machine
is constructed
now that would be the base requirement
for changing it or dismantling it
so you see you're seeing the forces come
into play there would be the necessary
forces to push back on the worst abuses
but those forces are not up to strength
so the reason you're not seeing
something like a fair fight
yet
is that the rising forces that are the
counter Force are not up to full
strength but they're definitely heading
in that direction
right I mean this time last year I had
you know far far fewer Twitter followers
so people like me who are trying to
explain the mechanisms and how it all
fits together and how you how you've
been abused and how people are abused
and how persuasion works and how
propaganda works and which characters
are the designated liars and which ones
maybe can be credible sometimes and how
do you know that one source is fake news
and how do you know the other is not
these are things you never saw 10 years
ago
compare anything you heard 10 years ago
to what you commonly experience when you
get on this live stream or get onto X
yeah it's more about the machinery
so as more people learn the machine
that should change how they act and vote
and and how they perceive the world
so there's there's Big Stuff happening
so if if the so-called internet dads
which would include women
um
you know if they all get taken out
there's a problem but so far
many of them refuse to die
the the more you cancel us the stronger
we get
all right
um
Russia got missiles New York Times which
of course cannot be trusted
um see again
instead of just telling you that the New
York Times reported on something
I remind you that it's part of a
constellation of non-credible
democrat-oriented media
that's completely different than how the
news used to be talked about in the past
yeah Community notes is a big part of
correcting things anyway so the New York
Times says that uh Russia has overcome
their sanctions and exports problems and
they just use third you know third
countries as they're cut out so Russia
can't buy stuff to build missiles but
some other country can so the other
country does it for Russia they buy it
Russia buys it from them everything's
fine apparently the American
goal of degrading Russia's military
capabilities
turned into
forcing Russia into hyper developing
their military capabilities so they're
better than ever
that's right
they're tank building and missile
building
capabilities are way better than before
the war now they may have less stuff
but their their production ability is
way above where it was before the war
now some of that's necessity of course
but
apparently we didn't slow them down
apparently all these sanctions are
 because they're we've
sanctioned so many so many countries
that they have their own economy
you know if everybody got along except
there was one bad country and then
everybody sanctioned the bad country
that would totally work
but if you start sanctioning you know a
quarter of all the countries in the
world
or at least you don't embrace them then
they create their own you know alternate
economy
you know Iran and Russia and you know
their little satellites and stuff now
Kim Jong-un just visited uh Putin
so you know now Kim jong-un's capacity
will be part of the mix
so probably
do you think that Kim Jong-un would have
met with Putin if Trump had been
president
well there probably wouldn't be a war so
there wouldn't be any reason for them to
meet but I've got a feeling you wouldn't
I've got to feel you wouldn't because he
wouldn't want to make Trump mad
yeah
all right so yeah Russia's got missiles
Winters coming the
the uh Ukrainian defensive appears to be
a a big nothing
but like I always say
what are you talking about war
the big nothing could turn into the big
something overnight because all of our
all of our information is sketchy and
there's a lot of things that might be
near a failure point you never know
until it fails
but it does look like the uh
honestly it doesn't look like a war
anymore to me I've been saying this for
a while but the Ukraine situation
is now killing young men
mostly
uh in a in a waiting game we're
basically just waiting for the next
American Administration
is that
does that sound too simplistic
to me it looks like both sides are doing
nothing but waiting for the 2024
election
because there's no way Ukraine can do
anything but what they're doing which is
breaking even if they're lucky
and Russia doesn't seem to have an
ambition
for going Beyond at the moment you know
the the stuff that they already hold
so it's obvious that Russia is just
waiting for Trump
wouldn't you say
isn't that like 100 obvious that Russia
is just going to wait till Trump so
literally every person who dies between
now and the time that Trump ends this
thing if that's the way it goes every
person who dies between now and then was
unnecessary
in the most yeah you could argue they
were all unnecessary everybody who died
but nothing would be more unnecessary
than a war that both sides know is over
both sides they know it's over you think
they don't know it of course they know
it of course they do
they know the war's over they're just
grinding up young men
until the timing is right to say what
they need to say and end the thing
yeah it's a baseless war somebody says
baseless
all right what else is happening
uh here's something that shouldn't
surprise you at all
so you know all those decongestants
you've been buying at your drugstore
says decongestant right on it well they
used to have
something called uh
uh pseudoephedrine or something but it
since that was a ingredient in meth
and the mathematics were stealing
do I have the right thing
yes so
so the addicts and the druggies were
stealing it off the shelves and then
they were using it to make their meth so
the part that you could make meth out of
was removed and replaced with a
phenylephrine
and the FDA said
that all those products that you've been
taking for years as decongestants
they had this phenylephrine
not one of them works
because the active ingredient doesn't do
anything
that's the FDA
the FDA just said all of those products
that say decongestant
don't work and never have
you never have after they changed the
active ingredient never have
so
now let me be careful because some of
you are going to have you know colds and
stuff and then you're going to say oh
Scott said these don't work I'm only
talking about things that say
decongestant
if it's something that says something
else it might still work right if it
says something something plus
decongestant
is possible that there's something
something works but not the decongestant
part so I'm not saying that all the
drugs are useless
only the ones I have uh fennel
phenylephrine and say decongestant
according to the FDA
so how many of you think that's a big
surprise
anybody anybody think that's a big
surprise nope
nope nope
yeah you know what the the
type of story that I have the least
trust in is one like this
this I'll just give you a generic if you
see a story that says new study
says that uh some existing medication
will work for even more people than we
thought before
like we thought that if you had a you
know a nice a slight sniffle they should
take it but now it's even before the
sniffle you should take it those stories
are always just marketing for the
company who makes the drug
so there was a timely history where
um high blood pressure
was considered over a certain level
and the people over that level got
medicated for their high blood pressure
and then well surprise this will
surprise all of you there was some new
science that showed that maybe that
existing drug or that class of drugs
would be good at even much lower levels
of high blood pressure huh something
that would you know double or triple
your income if you were making that
product huh so do you think that's
science
who knows who knows
I might die in front of you any moment
because you know my blood pressure at
least one point was high enough that it
should have been treated
and I decided that I didn't believe
science
so I'm not taking them
now if I weighed you know
200 pounds and uh you know if I were in
generally bad health I probably would
reconsider this and definitely don't
take my advice
let me say this as clearly as possible
if you take my medical advice you're
crazy
I'm just guessing I don't have any
medical experience I'm just telling you
that I just don't believe anything
anymore when it comes from the Pharma
industry I just don't believe anything
so if somebody says you should take this
drug that has a side effect
I say
Maybe not
maybe not
so but don't don't follow my advice for
sure
all right um
half of the country thinks there's no
evidence of any Biden impropriety but
here are the things we know bank records
we know that Hunter Biden was paying
Joe's bills we know that Joe Biden had
no identifiable income that would allow
him to have the big houses that he has
or the lifestyle he has we know that the
family members got millions we know that
they were producing no real product
we know the hunter was giving 10 to the
big guy
and we know that Joe Biden was aware of
Hunter's business and lied about it
now that's what the that's what the
Democrats are calling no evidence
or or as they're modifying it well no
evidence before he was president
right definitely no evidence before he
was sworn in
yeah the Tapper tilt
has anybody watched Jake Tapper to see
if he's doing the the uh the tap or tell
move his head sideways like that
um
yeah you know I get I get a lot of
comments to talk about the allegations
of
uh
family sexual improprieties
but I'm just not going to go there
because I I know what you saw and I know
what you you know I know what you saw I
that that's a that's a category that I
don't think is fair game
that's just not fair game
because you know what people let me tell
you a rule that I have
um if you find out that somebody said
something terrible in a private
conversation that nobody would have ever
seen let's say it was an email or a
message and nobody would have ever seen
it except let's say there was some legal
action that surfaced it or somebody you
know sent it to somebody
in my opinion
the person who said that terrible thing
privately is is free there should be no
you should not judge anybody for
anything they said privately period
at all no matter how much you hate it
private conversations
just have to stay that way
you know it could be like the the worst
I don't know you could be confessing to
a crime privately
and I still would say
it's private
that's a private conversation because
people don't always tell the truth
privately it doesn't mean it's proof and
I just think private conversation should
remain private
just all the time
yeah like grabbing by the yeah exactly
well I guess when people were surprised
that even Jake Tapper is calling Joe
Biden a liar for lying in the debate
with Trump that his son had made no
money from China when it's obvious that
they had so even
CNN and I think the Washington Post fact
Checker might be on the same page
so is that suggesting that the bidens
are done or Joe Biden's done
I think it does yeah I think it does
suggest that
um or at least that there are people who
don't want him to
you know be in be in the race
all right
um
there's a new study Dr Malone was
tweeting about
that suggests that kovid does not cause
myocarditis and that only the
vaccinations do and that once again we
find the fauci lied
I feel like I feel like it's just the
same story every time I wake up
uh let's see there's a new study and the
upshot of the new study is that uh
so she lied felt she lied next day I
wake up now there's a new study and the
upshot of it is uh let's uh faucy lied
about she lied is it just the same story
over and over again all they do is
change the topic yeah it's Max it's
vaccines it's myocarditis it's uh it's
natural immunity
have we now determined that fauci was
wrong about 100 of everything he said
I think it's 100 isn't it like
everything
and now there's a story about what's the
story about the CIA trying to cover up
the lab or the covet origin story
I don't know if any of that's true
yeah
so the one thing that we know about the
pandemic is that 100 of what we were
told was not true
all of it just all of it was not true or
it was based on you know people's best
guess and they guessed wrong which is a
different thing
I'll tell you what the oddest thing I
hear is this
because it doesn't comport with my
memory
because we found out we were lied to in
so many ways and that maybe the the
death toll wasn't what we thought you
know maybe it was other causes and blah
blah blah
people have taken that to mean that we
should not have um used any mitigating
processes
does that make sense
that based on what we know now
we should not have done anything special
we should have just gone on with our
lives how many think that makes sense by
today's based on today's knowledge does
that make sense
well here's my memory of it I'm going to
test my memory against yours because we
probably all have false memories my
memory was
that we were not doing any of the
shutdowns to
um per se save lives
directly I thought we were doing the
shutdowns to keep our medical services
from crashing
and that it might have done that
how many of you think that we didn't
flatten the Curve
we probably did flatten the Curve
it's just that the curve was still like
this
it might have been like that so so we
might have moved it from like this to
like that
you know we didn't flatten it
but it was maybe a little flatter
so
I thought the entire game was keeping
our our Health Care system from crashing
and I don't think anybody has proven
that that didn't work
so we we can prove that we did
everything wrong and that we were lied
to about everything
but there's no way to know that a little
social distancing
didn't at least slow things down
am I wrong
am I wrong about that
here's the people all right the people
who say that I'm wrong let me tell you
what uh how the news fools you
suppose you did a study
of uh
how quickly the virus
you know caught on
do you think you could compare any two
places
like Sweden compared to something else
does that still seem like a good
comparison to you
no if you still think that Sweden did
the right thing because they had a good
outcome that's completely non-factual it
might be true
but the the evidence doesn't show that
what the evidence shows is that Sweden
was different from the rest of the world
in lots of ways
so you can't really compare one country
that's different from the world in lots
of ways including a lot less obesity
and they have natural apparently in
Sweden it's common to have two homes you
know sort of a summer home winter home
situation
if you have two homes your social
distancing could be almost completely
good
right
if you have a younger population if you
have a population in Sweden they
supplement vitamin D
because they know they don't have the
right Sun situation so the swedes
routinely supplement vitamin D
are you telling me that wouldn't be a
big difference
everything we know suggests there would
be a big difference so if you had the
thinner people who naturally you know
naturally have distance
um and they supplement with vitamin D
and then you compare them to America
that's crazy you can't compare them
so I will say this I'm I'm not willing
to say that the shutdowns were
worthwhile
I'm not willing to say that because I
don't think there's evidence that shows
that they were worthwhile
I have not seen it but there's also not
evidence to show that it didn't work a
little bit
and maybe a little bit was enough to
keep our our health care System barely
working remember the in my case I had to
put off a surgery
for a year I think
my memory is failing but I think I had
to put off a surgery for like a year
and that really me up I mean my
health outcome for two years were
degraded because of putting that offer
here
because I had to get on prednisone and
then getting off a prednisone was a
problem in itself so
I don't know I I would say that
everything was a lie
but if you're judging the performance
you should judge it against did it keep
the Health Care System alive
you know the The Conspiracy Theory I'm
most interested in lately
is were the deaths caused by the
treatment
in other words the ventilators were the
ventilators killing people I mean we
know that they were used improperly in
some cases they were but how much of the
whole story does that explain
did the desk like drop off a hill as
soon as I stopped using ventilators
it's hard to know yeah it's hard to know
I don't know
hard to know
let's just agree we don't believe
anybody about anything
so everything we know
here here's the other uh analytical
error that I see almost everybody making
you ready
an analytical error that almost
everybody made
and it doesn't mean he made the wrong
decision you might have ended up in the
right place but here's the analytical
error
the vaccination was
um
insufficiently tested
and a novel type
therefore there was a lot of risk would
you agree with that
the vaccinations were novel they were
not tested sufficiently
there was a lot of money involved
basically every possible situation to
make it sketchy so you'd all agree that
the vaccinations had an obvious risk
obvious risk everybody agree
it was really really obvious okay
so if you were going to take an obvious
risk
you'd want to make sure that that was a
better deal than than not doing anything
now they're not doing anything we were
told
meant that you would get coveted without
whatever
protections they were promising you that
maybe weren't real right so you have the
second risk was the covet itself
and during that time we were told that
the covid had sketchy Origins that may
have been military in nature
as in if it's designed it's designed to
be worse
and if it's designed it may be designed
to kill you sooner or later
Etc
so I think that a lot of people said
let's look at the vaccination by itself
does the vaccination introduce a new
risk that wasn't there yes
it's a whole brand new risk that if you
don't take it you don't have any of
those you don't risk any of those
outcomes if you don't take it
but then people stopped
and they said I'd rather just get the
virus
but what did you know about the virus
see this is where I differed from most
people I said to myself there is no way
to know if getting the virus without
whatever little protection the
vaccination might give you for before
Omicron Omicron is a whole different
story but when it was Alpha and Delta
the experts were saying and maybe they
were incorrect but they were saying that
it would give you some protection from
the the virus the worst outcomes now
that might not be true
I'm not I'm not going to claim that
they're right about that everything
seems sketchy at this point but
the risk of a weaponized potentially
weaponized military virus
is what you should have compared to the
risk of the vaccination itself
so here's another way to look at that
you would be comparing two complete
unknowns
these are complete unknowns
how could you have confidence
comparing two complete unknowns
most people did most people like coffins
yeah
so
here's here's what I
here's my analysis
I said there are two unknowns one is a
vaccination that is designed with by
people who in the best case is meant to
protect you they may be wrong they may
get that terribly wrong but it was the
intention was to protect you
the virus
based on everything we still know
if it were if it were designed and it
looks like it was
it was designed to make your outcomes
worse
so you have two unknowns
one is an unknown but an intention to
make you healthier one is an unknown but
the intention is to kill you
or to make you sick forever
so if you have two unknowns but you can
tell the intention behind each of them
does it make sense to take the one where
the intention was to keep you healthy
even if they're wrong
versus the one where the intention was
to kill you even if they didn't design
it is strong enough to do it
again there's no way to know that's the
right decision
so do you know what I do when uh there
when the actual decision cannot be
measured and compared here's how I make
the decision
I I go down a level I say all right
there's no way I can say which one is
bigger so I go down a level and I say is
there anything else about this situation
where I could have certainty
since the two biggest variables are
complete unknowns is there anything
that's like second level down that
matters a lot
that I can be sure about and turns out
there was the one thing I could be sure
about
is that at the time if you got a
vaccination you could travel
internationally
that was the only thing I was sure about
so since the unknowns were complete
unknowns and can't be compared
I go down a level and I made the same
the same decision that Dr Malone made
Dr Malone knowing all the risks I mean
literally the expert knowing all the
risks but also knowing that the that the
covet itself is a risk he decided that
he would not get the vaccination
until he needed it to travel
internationally
that's what I did same thing
now did I make the right decision I
don't know
I know that I don't have any
identifiable medical problems that you
know would be some kind of vaccination
or even covered related at the moment
I'm in perfect health
so did I make the right decision no way
to know
and no way you'll ever know really well
I suppose if I got myocarditis now it
looks suspicious
but
so I didn't get the boosters do you know
I didn't get the boosters
because the boosters were pure risk
against Omicron that was looking
increasingly like it didn't matter
and I didn't need to travel
didn't need to travel
so that was it
now and of course I was I had a
comorbidity that other people didn't
have so I've I've asthma
I'm not sure if that was really a
comorbidity after all but the experts
were saying it probably was because you
know lungs you know you don't want to
have weak lungs and also get you know a
lung problem
so
um
and then and then there are a number of
people who irrationally believe that
whatever their own medical situation was
can be generalized to mind
what kind of analysis is that
that you're 25 and you've decided enough
to get vaccinated so you're a hero
compared to me who has no medical bad
outcomes but I got to travel
internationally the two best trips of my
life because no place was busy
uh
I mean I had literally the two best
trips of my life
because of getting vaccinated
so I may have guessed wrong
that's entirely possible if I had a
choice
if you gave me a choice and I were born
today
if there were no past and there were no
decisions where I didn't know anything
when I made them and I could just be
born today
would I choose to have the vaccination
in me no no no no no no no no
because I'm already past whatever
Omicron or whatever risk there was with
Alpha Delta
I'm not too worried about Omicron I
already had it
does someone say this is a cope I I
think the NPC copers
uh are having a tough time
cope cope
all right
I I think that cope is now the best
um probably the best tell for cognitive
dissonance I think those of you who are
clever just heard my whole description
and said okay that makes total sense but
the ones who are say cope cope are the
ones who realize that their own analysis
was
and that they made a life and death
decision incorrectly
so they're yelling at me cope because
they made a life and death decision
without knowing how to make decisions
that's dangerous
now did you make the right decision
possibly
possibly and I've never taken that away
from anybody have I you've never seen me
say it was a wrong or right decision to
get vaccinated or not I've never even
weighed in on that I've only told you
what I did and never I've never
recommended it for anybody else
so if you were bad at making a decision
and I and I just taught you that
then the way to prove that would be to
say cope
anybody else want to say it
anybody else want to acknowledge their
cognitive dissonance
I let the you the uh I let the YouTube
people comment today
so you can see all the cope cope
well I would uh
I would say to you that you may have to
cope with your bad decision making
capabilities
but it could be that you made the right
decision accidentally it's possible
and uh Christian says I think our
decisions are emotionally driven first
with a logical veneer
that is correct most of the time
um that would be true
when one of one of the decisions at an
emotional element to it in my case I
would say the emotional ailment was a
tie
since I had a fear of vaccinations
which I described quite um you know
quite directly for months before I got
one so I had a fear of vaccinations but
I also had a fear of Alpha and Delta
so they were sort of equal fears so I
would say when you have when you don't
have the fear of pushing you in One
Direction
then your little bit of rational
abilities can kick in
but you're never quite sure if you're
being rational
you had a bigger fear of the vaccination
right
um
all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I had for today if you have not
picked up your copy of reframe your
brain the best book ever written
according to everybody who's read it
every single person every single person
okay maybe not every person but a lot of
people say it's the best book they've
ever read and they're buying copies
three ten copies oh I would advise you
since since you're the special people
watching my live stream
um because because I'm independently
published it means they sort of make the
books when they're needed
they don't have a big Warehouse just
waiting for you to order the book so if
you're looking for Christmas presents
and or Thanksgiving gifts
um I think there's like a month delivery
delay on the hardcover so if you want
the soft cover that'll be faster than
the audio book and and the Kindle are
available right away but the hardcover
uh if you want that because it's a sort
of the best gift for them
you should order that right away for
Christmas and I would advise you that
for the price
it's sort of the perfect gift for
everybody over 14.
you know it's better you know maybe 19
is better than 14 but if you've got a 14
year old who's extra smart
you know you give them a little head
start
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
all I have for today and I'm gonna go do
some other things I got to get ready for
another podcast
and I'll be a guest on this one
and I'll let you know when that drops
bye for now
all right YouTubers thanks for joining
