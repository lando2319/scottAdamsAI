minute until after i turn it on
so they miss all this part
well well well
welcome to what will turn out to be one
of the finest
situations you've ever been in
i'm telling you the news today wow
wow
all kinds of news interesting things to
talk about why
because when the queen died
it made all of the
fake news have to wait a few days
so now all the fake news is dumping
because the the queen situation has now
settled down a little bit
so
i i just saw an important
correction there on the locals platform
a group of turkeys is a flock not a
gaggle
good to know
my house was attacked by a flock of
turkeys last night
which is a true story
a flock of turkeys walked down the
street
walked onto my uh
my house grounds and just started
 all over everything
i think they just came there to use my
house as their bathroom and then they
left
so i spent the night like actually with
a shovel
shoveling off of my driveway
because there were so many turkeys that
attacked
anyway if you'd like to take your
experience up a notch and i'm pretty
sure you do all you need is a copper mug
or glass a tanker jealous or stein a
canteen sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dope means of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous and it's gonna
happen now go
oh
what's going on over on
youtube i guess it's working
well
here's a little update
i told you i'm um i'm doing some i guess
you call it body hacking
trying to figure out why i keep falling
asleep when i write
but even when i'm not tired the rest of
the day it's only when i sit down to
write i fall asleep immediately
and so i had identified that i don't do
it as starbucks but then i started
isolating the variables
is it being a starbucks
or is it the beverage
or is it the temperature at starbucks
because they keep it pretty low
so yesterday my experiment continued
and so i had my same beverage and iced
some kind of iced coffee drink
and my same banana bread
and i ate and drank them quickly while i
was in starbucks
and then i quickly drove home
and tried to write at home
what do you think happened
i could write fine
so it turns out it wasn't the location
there was a little difference maybe
twenty percent
i do think that there's definitely an
advantage of being in a
cafe coffee shop situation i can
definitely write better
in those situations but staying awake
just the staying awake part it was the
beverage
so i've narrowed it down so it wasn't
temperature it wasn't location it wasn't
distraction it was the beverage
now it's the beverage plus the banana
bread
so i suppose the next thing i would try
is yeah getting rid of the banana bread
right
so
and i i point this out not because you
have an interest in my health because i
know you don't
really
i pointed out because this is such a
useful process
to try to figure out why do you feel the
way you feel
and then
very systematically try to change just
the variables that you suspect
and then monitor the change
the first time i did this was to find
out why i couldn't stay awake in the
afternoon
i wrote about this in my book how to
fail
um i would
be fine and awake until you know about
one o'clock in the afternoon and then i
couldn't even function i just couldn't
even function for a few hours
and i used to think it was because i
just eaten have you ever heard that
you come back from lunch and everybody's
like
sort of tired
and you think it's because of what you
ate and you're digesting right is that
what you thought
well it turns out that only happens if
you eat simple carbs
so i stopped eating simple carbs which i
generally in those days i did have at
least some for lunch and that's fine if
you if you take out the carbs you don't
get the
the crushing tiredness now that was just
for me
would that work for you
i don't know
but my point is that my body and your
body are not the same so i have to do a
test
very methodically by changing variables
and then measuring how things turn out
so use that process it will uh change
your life
now i've described what we do here
this live stream as a collective
intelligence and by the way i will get
to the news there's lots of good news
today
and so yesterday i tested it
um i
i was uh bet 50 dollars
that i have adhd
so i
i received a fifty dollar bill in the
mail
and i'm sure you're you're watching if
you send it to me
and the bet was that i could keep the
fifty dollars
um if i can prove i don't have adhd
which was a hypothesis for why i was
falling asleep on my laptop
and so i asked
i asked the question to
my twitter followers and i said you've
been watching me for a while
do you think i have adhd
and the answer came a resounding no you
definitely don't
especially from the people who actually
have
adhd
the people who have it were very clear
you don't have it
because you've done too many things they
had deadlines
i basically hit a deadline
every day for 33 years
there's no way in hell i have adhd
but i do have a concentration problems
but i think it has to do with how many
things are going on
you know
all right
so do you all agree i don't have adhd
but i want to add this little thought
imagine if you didn't have access to any
medical professions
professionals
and the only thing you had
is if you had a medical problem you
could go on some kind of live stream
like i am and describe your symptoms
and then the people on the livestream
would say oh
i had that same thing and my doctor said
i had x
so go look into x
i solved the biggest medical problem i
ever had
without a doctor
and it was because i searched around on
google until i found a victim
so i found somebody who was suffering
from the same voice problem which i
could quickly identify because the way
they talked was the way i tried to talk
and as soon as i knew
from the
from the sufferer
that they have the same thing i had i
can say i have the same thing it's
definitely the same thing and it was i
got it confirmed later
so it turns out that there was no doctor
who could accurately accurately diagnose
my problem
until
i knew what it was
once i had a name for it then i could
find the right doctor who knows what
that name is and then they say oh yeah
that's definitely it
and there was no doubt about it once i
had the name
so how many medical problems could be
solved
by simply asking the public
now i know what you're saying my god
that's that's going to get you killed
because the public's going to
recommend all manner of dangerous you
know treatments which they would
but imagine you didn't have any health
care
it would be way better than nothing
wouldn't it
because lots of times the solutions are
easy things that aren't going to hurt
you
such as don't eat simple carbs in the
afternoon well just try it
or they might say
you know you don't really know until you
get this blood test
well that would be one more thing you
know go get that blood test
so it could be very dangerous but on the
other hand having watched how many times
and by the way i have also solved
other people's medical problems
just because they asked me
and it's not because i'm a doctor it's
because in some cases i had the same
problem
for example
my old tennis player years ago
had horrible allergies
and so did i
but i'd made mine go away with allegra
made a big difference not go away but
you know got it down to a manageable
level
and so i said to him hey why don't you
try
one of these over-the-counter things and
then he did and has solved one of his
biggest problems in the world
so
i know there are plenty of examples of
doctor-less cures
but
somebody says this is comedy gold
now i'm aware that it would be risky
but it'd be interesting to test it if
you know if you could test it with some
population see if it helped but only if
they don't have doctors
so apple is changing their imessage app
which is the thing that allows you to
send a text message
from an apple user to another apple user
without using the network so it just
goes through apple's network
and it looks just like a text message
but it goes through apple's network
and now the new operating system will
allow you to edit your imessage after
it's been sent
do you see any problem with that
you can edit your imessage after it's
sent
i immediately said
how is that going to work for
couples
and and it took me about five seconds to
see a divorce attorney on twitter say uh
oh
now i have to warn all of my
divorced clients never to use imessage
right
because half of what you can prove in
any kind of dispute is some message that
somebody said once you can edit those
the whole divorce world gets turned
upside down
so
if you're in any kind of a sketchy
divorce situation
make sure the other person isn't using
imessage
well
have i ever told you that
mark twain once said that
people can't tell the difference between
good news and bad news
and there's so many examples of that
once you hear that you say well that's
not true
obviously people can tell the difference
between good news and bad news those are
opposites
who in the world
would not be able to tell the difference
between good news and bad news
people
let me give you an example
the inflation rate just came out and
it's 8.3 percent
good news or bad
well
you could say it's bad news
because it's so high
or you could say it's
bad news because the experts thought it
would be a little bit less
so that'd be bad news
or you could say it's good news
because it's less than it was last year
at this time
so which is it
is it good news because it's less than
last year at this time
or is it bad news because we thought it
would be less
and bad news because it's high
well let's see what the stock market
thinks
if the stock market is up it's good news
the stock market is down and the stock
market is in the toilet
so the stock market decided it's bad
news
do you know what i think it is
good news
yeah i mean i read it as good news
why
because it's direction that matters
so the stock market is judging it by
where it is
i'm judging it by direction
the direction is it capped and it is
slightly going down
now it might you know jiggle around
there
but what is not happening is it's not
going to 20
do you know how scary that would be
if it were going to 20
the the fact that it didn't change much
is some of the best economic news you've
ever received in your life and the
entire stock market said whoa
oh it's bad news
or they thought that other people would
think it's bad news so they're selling
before the idiots do i don't know
but it's hard for me to imagine
that everybody
you know not everybody thought this was
unambiguously bad news it doesn't look
like it to me
to me it looks like
the beginning of the turnaround
we'll see
well apparently right about now
uh congress is talking to
mr zacco the twitter security guy who
quit twitter
with some whistleblower complaints about
um about their
security
how interesting is that going to be
how much would you like to see the
republicans grill this twitter
whistleblower
about security
oh
that's gonna be good
and you know what's interesting
i find this fascinating
that twitter
being a you know gigantic tech company
obviously they can hire the very best
people
and yet the person who would know the
most about their security says they have
big security holes
now
isn't that interesting that twitter
a giant tech company that can hire the
best people that they want
is not doing as good a job as all 50
state
election systems
that are operating somewhat flawlessly
but you wish that twitter could ever
reach the level of excellence of our
uh
50 plus plus i get it i like to say 50
but i know it's 50 plus
50 plus states or 50 plus you know
places that they have elections
um
so that's
kind of remarkable
that all those elections are done so
well when twitter can't do it
i don't know i don't know what to think
about that
i guess twitter's got a problem
um
eddie zipperer
on twitter
tweeted uh something aggravated by rcp
real clear politics that of the final 74
generic congressional vote polls in
2020 all 74 overestimated the democrats
all 74.
now i i i think what it means is
overestimated how many there are i'm not
sure if it meant overestimated how they
would vote
i think overestimated how many there
were
but
what does it mean when all 74 errors are
in the same direction
i don't know it could be that they were
all fooled by the same data i mean it
could be just that
but it certainly raises a flag
here's a
here's a dog not barking
i love the dogs not barking stories
because it makes you mad when you hear
them
because you think oh why did i not
notice that dog not barking
here's one you didn't notice barking
where's all the fact checkers
for uh
for uh karine jean-pierre the
spokesperson for biden
where's all the fact checking
so fox news looked into the
fact-checking said politifact has done
just two fact checks while the others
have done zero
they just stopped it fact-checking
right in front of us they just stopped
fact-checking
what do you think it would look like if
they actually fact checked her
they can't do it
because remember biden's entire
proposition was
i'll bring you honesty and less lying
if the fact-checkers debunk his entire
reason for being before the next
election it's a bad look
it's a bad luck
um correction of myself so i'm going to
correct myself
don't you like it when i do that
correct myself and tell you the error
that i made
all right so i told you the other day
that um the 81 million votes for biden
could be completely explained by
population growth
and some of you said i don't think so
all of it
that could all be explained and the
answer is no
no it cannot all be explained
the other big factor is uh increase in
mail-in ballots
and the increase in mail-in ballots was
driven by
you know democrat funding and processes
and a big push for it but between those
two things they do explain why they were
81 million votes
now you might say
but those mail-in votes were fraudulent
to which i say
that hasn't been demonstrated
hasn't been demonstrated
i mean i haven't checked them myself
but there's no court that said that
there were a whole bunch of frauds
so there could be something in there
about
let's say gaming the system
in other words you know doing something
to get people who were marginal voters
or weren't going to vote
to vote with a little encouragement i
don't know how much of that's illegal
how much is legal
but probably that explains everything
probably the number of voters is just
explained by that to two factors
but again i'm not there so i don't know
for sure
did you see um russell brand
did a fairly major up sort of correction
apology
video
apparently he got taken in by the
ivormectin story
there were a number of prominent tweets
that suggested that ivormectin was
approved by the nih
it wasn't it was on the list of things
that they're testing but not on the list
of things approved
now
it was interesting to watch russell
brand handle
that error correction
because he he embraced it fully so fully
that i think conservatives thought it
was too far
it was a lot it was almost too much
apology it's like okay we get it you
made a mistake
you completely cop to it you don't have
to keep saying it
but you really he really stood on it
like he really pushed the
push that button as hard as you can push
the button on his own error
to make sure we knew
that it was an error
and that he was coming clean
now
i thought that was very interesting
because he's trying to carve out a place
of credibility
which is what i've tried to do as well
which is why when i make a mistake as
prominently as this one i like to tell
you about it because if i don't
you're not really going to trust that
i'm telling you what i really think
right
so it helps to be inaccurate and admit
it because then people will trust you
more when you say but i'm sure this
other stuff is right
it just adds to your credibility so i
would say that his credibility goes up
because he was wrong
what would you say
that that's my take i would say is his
believability and his credibility goes
up
because he admitted he was wrong yeah
and
and it's interesting
it's interesting how
how we all know that
but you don't see politicians doing it
much
and it must be the difference between if
you're a politician it dogs you forever
but if you're a media person maybe once
you do the apology correction people go
oh okay
he did what you can do
so i think he's probably different with
the political people maybe the political
people just should never apologize as
possible
so
fox news has made a big deal about this
and so has tucker carlson and
some others on fox news
and i'm i'm generally very reluctant to
buy into a conspiracy theory
but man this one is starting to form up
so solidly it's it's hard for me i can't
ignore it
that it exists as an allegation anymore
which is slightly different from saying
i'm agreeing with it in full
but the idea is that the democrats
intentionally
and intentionally is the part that i'm
not entirely sure about
we we can observe what happened
but it's the
the intentionality of it that i'm not
entirely sure about
that they imported the war on terrorism
because it wasn't enough external
terrorism to keep them busy i guess
and they try to turn it into domestic
terrorism
hey you've got a big domestic terrorism
threat so that they could keep intact
their ability to
monitor everybody
basically
and control you
do you believe that
do you believe that the democrats
are artificially
pumping up the domestic terrorism threat
so they can move the existing machinery
from the external threat world
to the domestic threat world
with a good excuse
and that then they can use those powers
to really control the public and keep
power
so most of you are on board with that
right
so do you believe that there was a
meeting
where somebody had that conversation
like actually out loud
do you believe that they said that out
loud
if if we can
if we can push this domestic terrorism
thing we can really get control of those
republicans
it looks like it
it looks like it
yeah it does look like it
if i had to if i had to bet on it
i'd say that there are enough people who
are democrats who have some control over
this process
that do think that democrats are better
off
it feels likely that democrats think
that democrats are better off with this
situation
but you know there are lots of different
individuals who have lots of different
complex thoughts
i'm not entirely sure they also that the
principal sat in one room and said
here's our plan
we'll move the structure over to the
domestic terrorism and then we'll really
clamp down on the freedoms of the
republicans and then there's nothing
they could do
but they might have
they might have
that i would not rule out that there was
an actual meeting
i usually do rule that out but in this
case
i can't rule it out
it's within the realm of things we've
seen before right
would you grant me
that it's within the realm
of uh
it wouldn't be out of character for the
people involved
right it's completely in character
because after you've seen the russia
collusion thing and after you've seen
the hunter laptop 50 intel officials
literally anything is on the table now
there's nothing that you could say well
that's out of bounds they're you know
they're never going to go that far
they created the russia collusion hoax
there's nowhere they won't go
they'll go anywhere
the the the 50 people who signed off to
say that the hunter laptop was
fake and it was russia disinformation
they proved that they will do anything
they must have known they were lying
some of them
they proved they'll do anything you
don't have to wonder anymore that that's
in evidence now they will do anything
would they kill
do you think the democrats would murder
somebody if they could get away with it
i think so yeah i think so
now
of course that's a horrible thing to say
yeah
clapper called it the consensus
community
yeah
um
i don't think they have that i know of
but it's
i think at this point you'd have to put
it in the option set
so do you remember when
bannon told you that there were 30 raids
on trump supporters
and did you think the 30 raids meant
that they went inside the homes of 30
people
and do you remember when i told you
no that's that's too on the nose
35 he said whatever the number was 35.
remember i told you it's two on the nose
turned out it was subpoenas so they may
have been knocking on doors
you know to serve the paperwork but they
weren't going inside it was about
paperwork
uh however
that paperwork is pretty damn scary
because it turns out that they can use
any excuse to look at all of
your personal information
let me say that again
they're now demonstrating that they can
use any excuse
to look at all of your stuff
and it appears that they're doing it
purely for political punishment purposes
that anybody
it looks like they're creating a
situation
where supporting trump means that all of
your privacy will be lost in the future
right
if if you were a trump advisor and you
were to start tomorrow
wouldn't you know that all of your
private information would become public
they would
would you work for trump
knowing that all of your communications
that have to do with anything
will become public or at least
the the legal system will see them i
wouldn't
working for trump would be ridiculous
that they have so polluted the well
that i would never take a drink out of
that well
no way
now i feel
now i also feel targeted i've told you
that before
now i'm not part of the inner circles i
you know it's not like messages i'm not
sending any messages to trump directly
or indirectly unless he sees him in the
media
so
i feel like i'm like far enough away
from his circle
that i won't necessarily lose all of my
privacy
what do you think
do you think i'm close enough to the
inner circle having no official role
whatsoever
but do you think i'm close enough to the
inner circle
that the government can ask for all of
my private communications
i think they can
because all they have to demonstrate is
that i had a conversation with somebody
who was right
true or false
all you would have to demonstrate
is that i had communication with people
who were involved that's it
because they only need to look at the
other person's communication
right
have i ever tweeted anybody or dm'd
anybody who was on that list
i'm not going to tell you
but not about this topic
i can say for sure
that i'm not aware of
anything on this topic i'm also going to
surprise you by saying something that
you're not going to believe
prior to january 6
i didn't really know anything about it
i didn't know there was going to be
you know any ugliness i may have heard
there was going to be a protest but it
would have just been noise like it
wouldn't have caught my attention
so i didn't even know january 6 was
going to happen
like as it was happening i was sort of
partly paying attention
so
i just want to say publicly
if you look at all my private
communication there won't be anything on
there about me knowing about any kind of
january 6 business
i can guarantee that there won't be
anything there
now
is that the reason that they're doing it
do you think the reason they're asking
for the communication is so they can
find stuff
i don't
i don't i think so nobody will
work for trump
that's what i think
now they might find something
so they might have you know some hope
but i don't think they expect to find
anything at this point don't you think
they already know that it wasn't planned
as an insurrection
at this point they know it wasn't
planned to be an insurrection
they know exactly what it was if they
find more email
it would just be people talking
maybe we should do this or maybe we
should do that but what actually
happened is pretty well known at this
point
so
i do expect
that they're going to come for me
if i keep saying anything positive about
trump getting elected
what do you think
let me put this to the
collective
intelligence here
do you think they're going to come for
me they meaning let's say the democrat
media it'd be mostly the media not the
legal system
i think so
i think so
how do you think they'll do
if they come after me do you think it's
going to work
do you think they will succeed
well they'll succeed with their base
meaning they will discredit me with
their base but i'm already discredited
with their base so
it makes it makes no difference
well i'll tell you what
um
unless i'm canceled from all platforms
they have a problem
so i'm going to make sure i don't get
cancelled from all platforms
because that does keep me safe basically
you know what keeps me safe is
you
okay because it would make you would be
it would cause too much of a ruckus if
they
came at me illegitimately
so i do depend on you to keep me out of
jail basically
all right
um
speaking of guns i saw somebody
mentioning guns
visa is going to start categorizing gun
purchases separately
now i didn't even read that article
i just read the title and i said
what
jesus is going to categorize gun
purchases
separately
why would they do that
unless it's step one
why would they
right
unless it's step one
your gun rights are basically toast at
this point
if they go after if if they make it hard
and i think the the public will do this
if it becomes too hard for a visa to
stay in business if they also service
gun buyers
they're gonna have to make a change
and i think there'll be pressure on the
banks and the
financing entities
to not support gun sellers and gun
buyers
now you won't even be able to do it cash
only
because the gun seller will you know
lose their
you know insurance and they won't be
able to transact business and
yeah if if the government wants to
really stop guns it's going to go after
the financial element
and it looks like this change by visa is
sort of foreshadowing that that might be
happening
yeah
so
i don't know i'd watch out for that
um
the other day i foresaw my own death
uh
which might sound weird to you but
here's some context
every major
element of my life i've seen in advance
now
i can't explain it
but
i do remember for example
my senior year of college i
i woke up from sleep
sat upright in my bed and saw myself in
san francisco
and i had no connection to cisco
whatsoever hadn't been there didn't know
anybody who lived there
didn't it didn't have a special
attraction to me
there was literally nothing about san
francisco
that said i should be there
but i woke up and i just saw myself
there a random city and of all the
cities in the united states
one day i went to my economics
advisor and i said
i'm thinking of working you know maybe
in the banking industry
where should i work
he said there's one bank that's really
doing a lot more in technology so that's
the one you want to go work for the
really it's really happening it's called
crocker bank and their headquarters is
in san francisco now i was in new york
whenever this
so that was number one
i was like really
really the one and he didn't give me two
recommendations he gave me exactly one
one recommendation of where to work
and their headquarters was in san
francisco the place i'd seen
now was that enough
was that enough to get me to san
francisco
it was not
it was not i came to california and i
stayed with my brother in
la area
and got a job at union bank
that was had nothing to do with san
francisco
so i get a job and i'm going to start on
monday
at union bank
i get a call from an ex-girlfriend
and she says you're in california
you should come visit me
for the weekend
i'm in san francisco
so i flew up for the weekend
and she said you don't want to work and
live in l.a
la is terrible
you want to live and work in northern
california so i said but i have a job
like i don't have any money but i have a
job there so i get to go back and get
money
and she said well why don't you try to
get a job here
and i said well i brought you know my
plane ticket blah blah i'll tell you
what
i'll go i'll try to get a job on monday
in san francisco if i get a job on
monday like my one day that i try
i'll live here
so i walked into crocker bank in san
francisco downtown san francisco and i
stood in line
at the teller you know for a teller like
a customer and i got up to the line and
said i'm looking for a job
can i work here
and the teller said just a minute i went
and got a supervisor
the supervisor talked to me for five
minutes and hired me
and i lived in san francisco
i'm still in the bay area
now i saw that
as clearly as i can
look at these monitors in front of me
i can't explain it
i have no explanation for that
i also saw one day
the home i would be living with
not in san francisco so i saw past san
francisco to a home
that i'd never seen
but i saw in great detail
there were some glass doors out to a
swimming pool area it was a nice sitting
area you know just off the pool
one day my my long time girlfriend and i
at the time after dilbert started
getting big
started looking for what would become my
first
you know high-end house
i was in a little condo at the time
and we looked at house after house and
all of them were like
and then one day we walked into a house
and it was that house
it was that house
it was the house i saw
and i stood there in that room
and i looked out at the pool
and i turned to my girlfriend at the
time and i said
this is our house
and she said ah you know i like it too
but
she loved it too
which was important because it was the
only one that we both liked
but it was a very competitive market
then and people were offering above
a selling price or offer asking price
so i said all right here's the offer i'm
going to make and it was
it was lower than you would have thought
i forget if it was above asking price or
not but it was well lower
than what i think both the broker and my
girlfriend thought i should offer
and i said
don't worry about it
we live in this house
that's our house
you don't even have to worry about how
we get there
because we're already there
i made an offer
my girlfriend went crazy because it
wasn't high enough and somebody else was
going to get that house it was the only
one she liked
we got the house
and we lived there for years
one day
in college also
i woke up and saw myself standing in
front of a
huge audience
and i didn't know why
but the audience was there for me
and i didn't know what my function was
but i knew that i was
owning them
i knew that the audience was
being entertained or enlightened or
something
now at the time i had no career
ambitions that had anything to do with
talking in front of an audience i didn't
have any public
ambitions i just thought i'd be working
in a business somewhere
one day
i became a
public speaker the the crowds got bigger
and bigger until one day
you know 5 000 people in the room
and i stood in front of 5 000 people
you know ready to do my thing
and i thought
damn it
i saw this
i always wondered why
but i saw it now when i say i saw these
visions i don't mean like i had a dream
these are awake
totally awake
but it pops into my mind and it's not
like a
an imaginary thing
it doesn't feel like a memory it doesn't
feel like i concocted it it's like i'm
looking like i had a photograph
and i could just see it
same with cartooning
i saw it
and every day when i wasn't a cartoonist
i would walk out to my mailbox i would
check my belt mailbox and i would be
puzzled
because something lucky hadn't happened
yet to make me a famous cartoonist
then one day i walked down to my mailbox
and there was a letter
from a cartoonist
who i'd asked for some advice a year
before and he'd given me some advice
and i'd take it as advice but i sent in
some samples and they got rejected and i
just quit
and a year later he sends me a letter
and said i was cleaning my office came
across your
samples you sent a year ago and just
wanted to make sure you hadn't quit
and i had quit
and because of his letter i took my
materials back out of the closet
started back in
and dilbert was born
so my whole life
i knew my mailbox
was the beginning of my cartoon career
and it was
it
was can't explain it
when uh in 2016 when trump announced
i i've given you
a tremendous number of reasons
why i thought he would become president
like his persuasion skill etc
let me tell you the real reason
those are not the real reasons
i always give them as my reasons they're
not the real reasons i don't give the
real reason
because it's not believable
here's the real reason
i saw it
i saw it
when he ran for re-election
i predicted that he would win again i
didn't see it
didn't see it at all
to me the the reaction was just as
opaque as everybody else i mean
i had opinions i thought but i didn't
see it
his first election
i saw it
i just saw it
i have always wondered
about my own death
and i've also been thinking recently
about whether i should move whether i
should sell my house because i'd always
planned that this would be the house
that i would die in i mean that's why
there's an elevator and it's why it's
built so you don't have to leave it
like even if you're on house arrest
and the other day
while completely awake
i saw my death
now i didn't see the cause
but it looks like natural
because i saw the scene of
approximately that the time of my death
i saw where i was
which is in this house by the way
so i will die in this house
so now i know
that i don't sell it
because otherwise i wouldn't be here to
die
i don't know when
might not be that far from now
but
because in the scene
this the
the scene looked modern day
right now it's going to look modern day
for a long time because the house
doesn't change
but
that was my death
now
i was also pretty okay with it
i was okay with it i was at peace
not only seeing it
but probably as it happened or as it
will happen
now i'm not going to tell you what else
was around it
because that part you're going to have
to wait
but there there's something else around
it
but you'll wait for that
anyway we'll see if that
comes to pass
so if anybody is younger than me and uh
someday in the future
you hear that i passed
find out if i was in this house
it's going to freak you the out
because i will be
well looks like the democrats have a
two-pronged strategy
that i have to say is brilliant
and i mean that
it's really really strong
and the two parts of this
they're going to reframe election
skeptics to look like trainers
already done right
already done
and then they're going to make sure that
the election looks as sketchy as
possible
then
they can punish everybody who says that
it was sketchy
so they can get their sketchy election
and punish the people who found out
or were complaining about it it's kind
of brilliant they've actually set it up
so all all the components are in place
you know as long as they have the doj
and
it's kind of brilliant they can just put
in jail anybody they want for
complaining at this point
do you know what the people in hong kong
are doing
to protest
they're holding up blank pieces of paper
do you know why
because in china
if you put a protest on a sign and hold
it up you're going to go to jail
but if you hold up a blank piece of
paper
not yet illegal
so they're actually protesting by
holding up blank pieces of paper
they're also doing that i believe
in great britain
relative to the queen's funeral right i
believe that's where it started actually
i think they held up blank pieces of
paper because they couldn't some people
held up paper that said
not my queen or something like that
and then that was actually illegal
so this holding up of blank pieces of
paper
i feel like this is coming to america
because
our ability to speak out about things
that look sketchy to us is shrinking
daily
and i don't know how
no matter what happens in the next
elections next two elections
i worry that the people who have the
most doubt about that are going to get
cancelled
i think they're going to get cancelled
so and here's my question if we know
that the mail-in ballots are going to be
the big variable
why are republicans not doing more about
mail-in ballots like to get more
republicans to use them
so that they'll get more votes
and and gather them and you know do
every mule thing that the democrats do
that's legal
what's that i have to look at that
comment
all right
um
so that's that's what's happening it
looks like the elections are all
elections look sketchy if you're on the
losing side right
famously the democrats thought that the
2016 election was stolen
because they lost
surprise
so
what do we do about that
like we as a country not as a republican
but
what do you do about the fact that the
democrats have set this perfect trap you
can't question elections without being
an insurrectionist
or a trader
and then the elections will in fact be
non-transparent
at least
not completely transparent
well if the
let me say it directly if the
republicans don't go nuts on mail-in
ballots and like really put all of their
energy into getting republicans to vote
with mill in ballots or any other way
well they deserve the loss
because you know the game you know what
it takes to win if you know what it
takes to win and you don't
win
that's on you
all right um
so joel pollock was reporting in
breitbart that doj is refusing to
release biden administration plan to
intervene in the 2022 election
what
what
now
joel uses the word intervene
which is technically correct
but
apparently they have some kind of plan
in their words to improve the integrity
of the election
but wouldn't you like to see that plan
what what does it look like when
democrats want to improve the integrity
of the election
that is so sketchy
oh wait i can't say it's sketchy
because i'll be labeled the traitor and
then canceled
totally appropriate whatever they can
hide it if they want
go ahead and hide that stuff it's okay
with me
so yeah that's the sketchiest thing in
the world
um
um i'm going to tease this but i can't
give you the details yet i've seen the
details but it's embargoed until a
little later
but rasmussen is going to give you some
poll results pretty soon
uh they show the priorities of the media
versus the priorities of
the voters
do you think they line up
do you think the priorities of the
citizens
are similar to the priorities of the
media
what do you think citizens care the most
about
eating
eating
basically economic issues
dominate
citizens
right so economic issues are everything
from inflation to
blah blah blah blah right
uh gas prices
um what would the media think was the
sexiest story
do you think the media wants to tell you
your inflation is 8.3 every day
it's not very interesting
um
well
there's so the media likes things that
blow up and are sexy
so it likes foreign wars it likes
you know climate change it likes you
know
uh
issues of you know fairness and equity
and stuff like that so yeah there's
there's no correlation between what the
public wants and what the media thinks
are the top stories
surprise
here's what i think is trump's primary
problem
i think he violated
an
um
unwritten agreement
that you don't threaten to put in jail
your competitor when you're running for
office
and he directly told hillary clinton he
would put her in jail if he were
president
you said it in public to her face
now i forgot about this
but there was a uh a memo or an email
that we do know about
that
was sent in october of 2016 from clinton
to donna brazil
i think was her campaign manager
that and this is why hillary said quote
if that effort bastard wins meaning
trump we're all going to hang from
nooses you better fix this
fix this
you better fix this
is that how you talk to a campaign
manager
fix it doesn't sound like the right word
does it
i feel like
we need to change our strategy
or we need to go harder against it
or we need to rethink what we're doing
or we need to work harder or we need to
have more
more events
but who says fix it
fix it
suggests
there's a lever to pull
as in actually fixing it
right yeah it's a little bit more boss
you know they always say that about
trump and i make fun of them for saying
that so i'm not going to say the mob
boss thing but you can see how somebody
would say that about this
now here's my take
who would do the russia collusion hoax
who would do that
i mean that is such a risky play
especially when you get caught and they
did
who would do that well who would do it
to somebody who was afraid of going to
jail
so it feels like the russia collusion
thing was sort of a to put pressure on
trump
to get him out of there or at least
discredit him in case he came after
hillary i feel like everything
that's being aimed at trump
is all because he threatens to put
democrats in jail what do you think
and i think if if he didn't
if he had not
said he was going to drain the swamp and
put people in jail
that there wouldn't be nearly as much
pushback against them
because i don't think it's about
policies
it's also about policies but i don't
think that's what's really happened i
think i think he broke the unwritten
rule
by saying he would literally put hillary
in jail
now i don't know if he meant it
but
i do think that everybody at that level
has broken enough laws that they could
go to jail
so she may have broken a law we don't
even know about
now it's my opinion that all
billionaires are you know if they have
complicated businesses
they're they're all bending a law up
somewhere
right
so if you look hard enough you're going
to find something
for anybody who has a complicated life i
think
it may not even be intentional could be
accidental
but i think that was trump's a big error
is literally making it about jail for
the loser as soon as you make it if you
tell me you're going to put me in jail
if i lose
what am i going to do to win
anything
yeah let me say that clearly if you
threaten me credibly with going to jail
if i lose the election
there's nothing i won't do to win the
election
i would cheat
to stay out of jail
of course
i would cheat like a i
would cheat like you've never seen
cheating
and would i feel bad about it
nope
nope i would not feel bad about it if if
i were keeping myself out of jail
so that's the situation when
did you see there was some video i guess
trump allegedly was going golfing but
then went out on the golf course with i
guess hannity and some other
high-end
people it looked like maybe a strategy
conversation and he just needed to go
where he couldn't be observed
so something something's brewing in
trump world probably something to do
with his announcement
i would guess
so hannity uh on his program last night
did a uh a live scroll while he was
talking of all the legal allegations
against trump now his point was that
there's so many of them that it's
obviously a ridiculous
you know effort to just get them any way
they can
now the democrats look at it and say oh
my god
this backfired hannity
what you did was show a list of all of
trump's crimes
two movies
one screen
right so if you're a democrat you see
hannity admitting all these crimes of
trump
that's what you see
if you're a republican you see that
there's so many of them that are they're
obviously ridiculous
like even if you imagine one was true or
even more than one was true
it's obvious that most of them are not
because of the sheer quantity of them i
mean he couldn't break that many laws
unless he had you know 25 hours in a day
so when i look at i go oh yeah that's
pretty convincing that that's
and they look at it and say well look at
all those crimes
um
so
um here's a uh
well there's a question for me
so it's illegal to incite people to riot
i'm not sure i knew that before this
january 6 business did you know that
it's illegal to incite people to riot
now i did 10 seconds of research to find
out
that
this the situation in which it would be
illegal is very
tightly
described
but there's still some wiggle room there
and the tight description is the riot
has to be imminent
not a conceptual riot right so it would
not be illegal i think
i think it would not be illegal for me
to say hey
you guys should go start a riot
because there's no imminent riot it
would just be me talking that would just
be free speech but if there's one
forming
like you can see a riot forming
and then you say hey
pick up those bricks and throw them at
those people
then i guess that's incitement
right
so you're telling somebody to do a
dangerous thing in the context of
something that is literally obviously
dangerous
and then you're getting them to do
something even more dangerous
like great abs yeah
uh
so my question is this
this is a weird legal standard isn't it
since when since when
am i responsible for your crimes
because that's what this is
this is me talking
by you committing the crime and i'm not
hiding anything from you
in this case there's no fraud involved
i'm just saying i think you should pick
up that brick and
do something bad with it right in the
middle of this thing that looks like a
riot forming
it it seems to me that
um everybody is being influenced by
somebody
i mean you could always find out who
influenced you who incited you
if your spouse does something terrible
and then you
punch them
and and here will make it um either
gender either way
right so it's not about men beating up
women it's just about domestic violence
either way so if somebody hits the
spouse
do you get to say yes i hit my spouse
but look at how my spouse incited me
that my spouse said look hit me hit me
go ahead hit me
and then you know did these terrible
things
and you know i wasn't going to
but i got incited into doing it
now that wouldn't work at all right
that's not that's not argument so where
does free will come in
at what point does your free will
which i don't think exists so that's
another question but how do you have a
legal system that sometimes says
it's completely your fault
but in this case this one case it says
well it's also the other person's fault
who gave you the idea
i'm not sure it should ever be illegal
to give somebody an idea
what do you think about that
now it would mean that people incited
riots would go free
and i and i'm accepting that as the cost
of getting rid of it i don't think
people should ever be
go to jail for words
now if the words are yelling you know
fire in a theater
okay
because that's your words cause the
damage if you um
say something untrue about somebody and
it damages them okay
but but those are really direct damage
and it's your words that are doing it
but if your words cause somebody else to
do the crime
and they know it's a crime
no
i have a problem with that being illegal
at all
here's a ukraine update
so russia knocked out
power in a bunch of places i think
there's some water facilities that might
have been at risk too
and
um ukraine is
still
having battlefield victories but we
don't know if they're substantial yet
it's possible that everything that
they're reclaiming
is the stuff that russia didn't care
that much about and they just reinforce
the stuff they care about and maybe
that's maybe it's a big nothing in the
end we'll find out
but
the fact that russia knocked out
ukraine's power stations their domestic
power stations
suggests that russia was out of
options do you feel that
that going after the um the citizens so
directly because russia was trying to
get some influence on ukraine that would
be lasting
and you don't get lasting influence if
you if you directly attack citizens you
want to go after the military only
but attacks on the power station is an
attack directly on the citizens
is that the first time they've directly
attacked citizens
now
you know indirectly because it's turning
their power off
have they directly attacked citizens
people well they have shelled
i don't believe the story is about
shelling schools and shelling hospitals
because usually there's a military
facility in there
that's intentionally trying to draw some
fire
so i don't i don't believe all those but
they have shelled population centers
they've also pulled back from it
so it didn't go too far
so here's my point
i think that putin is signaling that he
can't
simply win militarily
on the ground where the the battles are
it looks like he had to do something to
show that he still had strength but the
only thing he could do was something
that was sort of in a different domain
like it's like he's given up this domain
because all putin would have to do
is push back the ukrainians in one part
of their counter-offensive
and then the whole narrative changes
putin only needs one minor victory
in in all of this counter-offensive
going on just one victory
to show that the ukrainians can be
defeated
and instead
instead of producing one victory
he sent off these expensive missiles and
attacked the residents
citizens of ukraine
to me that demonstrates he's out of
options
now are you worried about a nuke
tactical nuke
here's my opinion
you can't ever nuke your own country
you can't nuke your own country
his entire argument is that ukraine is
basically owned by russia that's his
argument you can't nuke your own country
you cannot nuke your own country
now unless you're crazy
now i can't rule out crazy
but you can't nuke your own country
you can't
not not expect anything good to come out
of it
because the the the nuclear fallout will
just sit there
like close to forever
how can you manage a country
where you just radio you just nuked part
of it
you can't manage that country
it's over it's game over you nuke your
own country or the one that you call
your own country you don't stay leader
that i don't see that putin would take
that chance
unless he's crazy now
shall i confess a blind spot
my blind spot was i didn't think he
would attack ukraine in the first place
and i said that publicly a number of
times even when he had amassed
huge forces on the border i still said
no it would be suicide
he's not going to do that unless he's
crazy
and then he did it
now
i thought he was crazy because i thought
the ukrainians would do a much better
job militarily
than apparently the military thought
so i thought it was crazy on the surface
but apparently most of our military
didn't think it was crazy they thought
putin would take over ukraine and in
days
so maybe maybe putin thought the same
thing
so he wasn't crazy for invading ukraine
because he was operating under the same
information that both sides were which
is that it would be somewhat easy
just wasn't
but when you talk about nuking your own
country
which is what
putin would say of ukraine that it's all
part of russia
that's not something that
you could be fooled by somebody else's
opinion right
so i think putin was
a little bit fooled by the fact that
even his enemies thought he would
succeed
if your enemies think you'll succeed
that's a pretty good endorsement for
going ahead
but there's literally no one who thinks
putin would be better off
or could even find advantage with a
nuclear
tactical nuke
i just don't see it
but
keep in mind i was wrong on a very very
big putin prediction that he wouldn't
invade so you have to you have to put
that in my
my balance when you're you're weighing
my credibility on putin
you should weigh in mind how wrong i was
on that one thing but also why it was
wrong
so there was a small story that i think
is a big story
there's a story about a citizen in the
russian occupied area
who when the russian troops took over
the uh
one of the russian soldiers came over to
one of the ukrainians and said
something like
well we liberated you from the nazis
and then these the ukrainian citizen as
he's the one telling the story he said
can you point to one
where are the nazis that you liberated
us from
because we don't see any
and then the soldier was
confused
and then the citizen explained that he
said to the soldier
you see that house that you just
destroyed that was a russian's house he
just moved here from russia
you just destroyed a russian citizen's
house
and then and he basically started laying
the the guilt on him
now imagine being that russian soldier
when you thought you were there for a
reason
then once you won
you had some casual contact with the
locals
and the locals say
what the did you just do
imagine being
22
and having a 45 year old
ukrainian citizen
come up to you and say
you little stupid piece of
you've been completely fooled
you're over here killing us and you
don't even know why
show me a nazi show me one nazi
you just killed my son
you just killed half of this
village you little piece of
we're russians
we're you i mean we're not russians but
we're basically the same people you
don't even know why you're here
right
isn't the conversation gonna go like
that
the ukrainians are not going to be going
after the russian soldiers with just
hate
hate wouldn't get it done
they're going to go after them with
empathy
empathy gets it done you know why
because everybody has empathy for
themselves
and the ukrainians are the russians
effectively right they're not russia
they would like to have their own
identity but when they're standing there
talking to each other
they're the same people
and they know it
when they're talking to each other
they're the same people
and they can't understand why they're
there
so i think
that the russian the weakness in the
russian military is because the locals
shamed them out of fighting
i believe the locals have shamed the
soldiers and the fighting
i think that's going to be the big story
not necessarily the mothers i think it's
going to be the fathers
because when i heard about what this
this one ukrainian said to this one
soldier and you know this may be
exaggerated or something
but
this would be devastating
ima put yourself in the in the head of
the soldier
you just been like you risked your life
you've been killing people maybe you saw
some atrocities
and then then you conquer it and the
people you conquered say why are you
even doing this
we're not your enemies
why are you even here
we are you
so i imagine it'd be pretty devastating
to morale at this point
that's my take on that
have you ever wondered about
why reparations haven't gone further
in terms of a policy
you ever wonder about that
because there are a lot of things that i
i thought wouldn't go very far
but did climate change
you know the crt stuff there's a lot of
stuff i think well that's not going to
go very far and then it just goes all
the way and
becomes a law sometimes but reparations
haven't really gone anywhere have they
i have a theory why
would you like to hear the theory
of course you would
it's because once you handed it to
economists
everything would blow up
because economists
um you know unless they're totally in
the bag for one political party are just
going to look at it and compare it to
things and be objective here's how that
conversation would go
all right
uh let's let's take our precedence
first precedent is there were
reparations
for uh japanese interned prisoners
during world war ii
now i'm uh i have a closeness to that
topic
because i've personally known people who
are in the those camps
and i knew them well like they're people
i associated with a lot
they were the older relatives of my my
ex
and my first ex
and
they were actually in the camps
i was alive
and so are you
many of you are alive
well there are still living
american citizens of japanese descent
american
citizens who were in prison camps
just for their ethnicity
in your life
in your life they're still alive
right now the ones i knew i don't know
if they're all live at least one of them
would be young enough to still be alive
some of the other ones i think have aged
down since then
yeah george george takai was in one
now they got reparations
but
correct me if i'm wrong i need a fact
check on this the only people who got
reparations were
people still alive
the people still alive
there were no reparations to
descendants
maybe there should have been
but there weren't so in terms of
precedent
there were uh reparations for living
people have happened now there are no
living people who are slaves
so the first reason for reparations
they're still alive
that goes away
so then you're just down to a pure
economic argument about systemic racism
and actual racism and how much of an
economic
disadvantage that caused here's how that
calculation would go
first
you'd say
how much did
black people lose
however you want to count that because
of
because of slavery
so how would you calculate how much they
lost because of slavery
well i have a degree in economics i'll
give you i'll give you a starter
you first have to compare it to
something
so the first thing i would compare it to
is the people who stayed in africa and
did not become slaves
so you say how is there economic
situation today
you compare it to the average black
american who did descend from slaves
if
if the blacks who stayed in africa and
did not become slaves were making
millions of dollars a year and the
average black american was not
you'd say well there's a good argument
you know if we left them in their
natural habitat they'd be millionaires
just like the ones they left behind
but if the americans are actually better
off
the descendants of slavery
than the people who are the descendants
of people who are not slaves
in the same area the same same country
whatever
then the argument would be that
there's no reparations
but that's not all
you would also have to say what has
happened
relevant to it all now one of the
problems with the systemic racism
is that it
pushes or let's say incentivizes some
amount of crime
in the population that's disadvantaged
so when you have to also add in
the amount that was transferred from
white people to black descendants of
slaves through crime
and that's a pretty big number
it was estimated up to 2.6 trillion
dollars per year just in the united
states
2.6 trillion so what you do is first
you'd
you'd calculate how much white people
have stole from black citizens
which is a lot it's probably billions
then you calculate how much of black
citizens are stolen from
white citizens and then you take the
difference see which one's bigger
see where i'm going
you couldn't possibly calculate anything
let's say rationally and responsibly
without opening up opening up so many
cans of worms
that you couldn't handle the blowback
if you were to look at it objectively
nothing would be owed
if you looked at it objectively
nothing would be owed that's why you
can't do the calculation
because it works it works as a talking
point and as a political point but if
you actually try to calculate it it
would be very embarrassing
it would be very embarrassing
because it wouldn't work out the way
anybody is expecting it to
now i'm saying this as somebody who is
very experienced
in
financial calculations and predictions
and stuff it's what i did for a living
now find me an economist who disagrees
with what i just said
there's your challenge my
my belief is that anybody with an
economics background is going to see the
same pitfalls that i see maybe a few
more
they might even see a few more but you
can't take that to actually law and
calculation
because if you did
it would reveal something you don't want
to reveal
it would sort of blow the story out of
the water
well germany is uh
in trouble with power as you know
and
they're building uh
they're still planning to shut down a
nuclear reactor
do you know what the german citizens are
doing
because they know that they might run
out of a gas coming in from
russia
what would you do
if your home
is heated by gas
and you know you might run out what
would you do
tell you what i'd do
i'd go to amazon.com and i'd order
myself a nice electric
um heater
you know the kind that you plug in and
heats one room just in case
now what happens when a gigantic number
of germans
by electric heaters just in case
because that happened
that's happening right now
the germans are buying electric heaters
as fast as you can buy an electric
heater
now what happens when they plug them all
in
well
at least they don't have to use that gas
they can't get from from putin
but then they're going to have to use
the electricity that they don't have
because they closed their
uh nuclear plant
so watch out for your unintended
consequences
so germany's
i think germany's gonna muddle through
like i think they'll i think they'll
recover they'll find a way a way to
sustain in the long run but it's going
to be an ugly uh ugly season
all right
um i'd like to just show you my my
homework that i'll be working on
this is my drum pattern that i'll be
learning today
it's a right left left kick kick right
left right left left left kick kick
right left
all right
now i've also heard the argument
that
people plugging in their electric cars
all at the same time will be impossible
because it would be too much of a drain
on let's say california's grid
but
aren't we missing an opportunity here
here's what i think
imagine an electric car in every garage
in california
just hypothetically
now imagine that we still have a power
problem
still power problem
now imagine
that your electric car
when you go home at night and still got
some
power in it
that you drive home at night let's say
it's 6 p.m
from 4 to 9 p.m is your peak electric
usage hours
so you come home around six
plug in your car but your car
is used as a power source
so instead of powering it between the
critical times you use whatever is left
in it to power your house
and maybe that's enough to limp through
until nine o'clock
and then you recharge your car
now that only works if you're not going
to use your car right
but you know if you're going to use your
car
like you usually know by
you know and also you don't have to you
don't have to drain the whole car
maybe you could drain your car down to
20 capacity
and 20 would get you to the grocery
store and back you know you wouldn't
have to worry about anything
but am i missing am i missing something
or are we ignoring the fact that if
everybody had a tesla
just as one example
everybody would have a pretty
substantial backup battery sitting in
their house
yeah so everybody would be charging at
the same time but if they're doing it in
the evening
it's not going to be that big a deal
you have to charge it first yeah you
have to get it going of course
now i also saw and
a scary
calculation that said that if we wanted
to build all these electric cars
it's not possible because there are not
enough reserves of rare minerals
anywhere in the world
to be even close
to the number of cars we need
because the batteries
do you believe that
do you believe
smart people are saying this that the
total known um you know that we could
commercialize
is nowhere near it's like i know five
percent of what you would need to have
enough electric cars to make a
difference
yeah
i i guess
i'm going to go with i think they'll
figure it out now i told you there are
10 battery companies right now that are
making
batteries at least one of them with no
rare materials
so that might be the only change the
only change might be that the
the
uh existing batteries turn into a
different kind of battery
could be
illegal gang threats
are there illegal gang threats going on
cernovich tweeted somebody says
i don't know about that
they recommend outdoor charging in case
of fire
uh i wish they would let the market
decide well i think the market is going
to decide on electric cars because they
already sold enough of the market on
climate change
and
i don't know how many of you have ever
driven a tesla
but my i haven't by the way but my i've
been in them i haven't driven one my
understanding is that once you drive one
you say to yourself well this is the
best car i ever had
that's what i hear
so
that would be the reason that people get
them
in california the reason that people
drive a tesla is the best car
did you know that
so where i am there's teslas everywhere
i mean
we're just swimming in tesla's if i if i
walk outside there's a tesla going to
drive by
but the reason people have it the same
reason uh californians mostly have
iphones right
in california it's rare to find somebody
who doesn't have an iphone
an apple laptop
and a tesla
or at least one of those things
right and the reason that all three of
those
are purchased is that they're the best
ones you that people think they can buy
like there's nothing better than a mac
laptop there's nothing better than an
iphone there are things that are roughly
as good but there's nothing better
and there's nothing better than a tesla
like you can get your mercedes
but if you're sitting in your mercedes
and somebody pulls up with a new tesla
there's there might be a difference in
the cost not that much actually but
there might be a difference in the cost
but i don't think the tesla person is
looking over at the mercedes and saying
ah
wish i could have one of those
that's not happening
the tesla is the the more desirable car
for techies especially so the the
technical people
are totally geeking out on the
engineering of it
so if you're really into good
engineering i guess that's another
reason to have a tesla or a german car
yeah it's sort of a status and i care
and all that yeah
all right
i believe i've delivered the finest
entertainment you've ever had in an hour
and 24 minutes i don't think there's
anything
that could be better than what you've
just exhibited i don't have the mustang
anymore
to answer your question
uh that was always for my step-daughter
so she's that's her car
waterfront ignore ukraine news illegal
threat dire cernovich and adam townsend
twitter last 24 hours covered the
waterfront
the waterfront meaning uh water shortage
is that what you're talking about what's
the waterfront
all right
um
meaning big picture
i don't know what you're talking about
i'll go look into that we'll find out
what they're all about
um
oh julia you've experienced that
pulling up next to a
tesla in your mercedes
uh
topic the waterfront is the topic
oh there's a typhoon heading toward
china's main port
oh
um
all right well we'll go look at that
we'll find out what's going on there
and uh
until tomorrow
what a great time this was wasn't it
best time of the day
