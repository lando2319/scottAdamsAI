well this is the pre-show not the show
we'll get going at the top of the hour
in
approximately seven
minutes but for some people like to get
in early and uh chat with each
other go wild I see you're already
chatting you didn't need to be told I
still have to print my notes and make
sure my lighting is right and my sound
and we'll be ready to go in a few
minutes there might even be
a
premature simultaneous or asynchronous
sip but first let's get some
notes I don't know if you could tell but
my wifi my internet screaming it's just
screaming and my my printer is
working wow my day looking
good Glenn Beck was talking about the
tick tock persuasion
threat
well have I ever told you my trick for
tracking my own
persuasion I look for language
changes so I look for anybody else to
start using language I've
used now I didn't invent the word
persuasion
but let me ask you
this do you think the Tik Tock debate
would include the word persuasion if I
didn't
exist I don't know the answer to that
question but do you think people would
be using the word
persuasion
if I did not uh sort of emphasize that
word a
lot are you hallucinating oh you're
hallucinating that the microphone
disappeared so you lost sound for a
minute you
say
interesting how's it sound
now
we've got different
opinions yeah obviously I didn't
uh well we're going to make some news
today yeah there there's some days when
I'm surprised that I make
news but today I'm definitely going to
make some news so don't miss
that
Today's show will be
beefy look at that look at
that a number of you have asked
me how's my viewers so far pretty good I
mean it's not Tik Tock numbers but it's
pretty
good oh you know what I wanted to check
wanted to check my
Spotify
numbers do
that let's see if this
works no that didn't work or did
work so Reon I'm checking is that
there's some some conversation going on
about how little U musicians make on
Spotify but dashboard doesn't seem to be
working
dashb yeah I'll be damned the website's
broken we're definitely going along
today yeah we'll talk about V
response and all that
stuff let me check my uh
internet as you know it's been an
issue but I think it's all
resolved well let's
see so this is where the stream going
that's actually
weak that's actually the lowest of
signals been in 24
hours
huh watch the
upload okay that's the lowest that's
been
to I guess there's a lot of usage right
now probably it's probably what's going
on
um so it was 10 times faster last
night 10 times faster
so I don't know what's I don't know
what's different maybe just a lot of
usage we'll be going live in less than a
minute where is everybody we're all
here it's workday yes it
is I was surprised that last Friday's
Allin
podcast
[Music]
uh sack said he didn't think Tik Tock
persuasion was a big
deal well you know what maybe not yet
let's do a show you
ready yeah you're ready you look
ready
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
that's what you're going to do Today's
Show maybe the best show
ever maybe you never know stick around
maybe we'll make make some news too
let's see but first if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
nobody can even imagine all you need for
that is a cuper Mugger glass a tanker
chaler Stein a canteen Jugger flask a v
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dope of
me the end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go so
good well I saw a story today that
there's a new wearable
technology that uh help researchers
determine which coffee is the best so
you put some put a little uh thing on
your head with a bunch of sensors then
you taste some different things and no
matter what your conscious brain tells
you the device will tell you how much
you really liked
it which is which is awesome uh by the
way I know somebody a good friend of
mine who does this kind of work so if
there's an AI company that wants to
train their train their AI how to figure
out human emotions
and human reactions you could actually
do that by capturing enough human
reactions to things that it forms a
database that AI could use to pretend to
have some human reactions to things
anyway so that's a possibility if
anybody wants a good resource there um
one of the things I learned yesterday is
a complaining work sometimes you ever
complain about stuff and nothing happens
I had this weird day yesterday where I
complained about things and and things
happened they give me an
example um I complained because my my
blue check went away on
X uh it goes away if you change your
profile picture takes a while to be sure
that you're really the same
person and uh I complained that I didn't
think it was ever coming back because it
was taking longer than it should and it
was back within an hour I think an hour
after I complained it came back coin
Ence could be I don't know but here's
here are the other
examples
um so uh I complained about
my I complained about my internet
because I've had a really I don't know
years years is bad internet literally
years where it just goes in and out and
you know glitches all the time and I
finally just had enough and it got so
bad that I couldn't couldn't even use it
and every time I done it
xinity would say they fixed something
and a connection to the house or
something and sometimes I'd update my
modem and it seemed to work a little bit
but not
totally and so yesterday uh I went
through the normal tech support but that
was wasn't working out so they had to
escalate it to the like level two so now
I had basically two levels of tech
support and then I complained about it
on the
xplatform which definitely got their
attention so then that gets the
executive Response Team involved so at
one point I had uh I think I had three
separate response teams working on it at
the same
time within an hour of the uh contact
with the the top guys there was a truck
outside my house doing something on the
street but when they were done I had the
best internet I've ever had it was about
twice as fast on the download and and 10
times as fast on the upload I didn't
even know that was possible so it was
always in the network had nothing to do
with my house and for 10 years or so
I've been dealing with this and fixed it
yesterday by I finally complained enough
I
guess well then there was also my
complaint about Tik Tock which uh got
pretty big response uh V contacted me
and also he dm'd me just to you make
contact because he has a very different
opinion on Tik Tok and then he alerted
me that he was going to do a uh a live
stream so he did a live stream last
night I think it was on X and I watched
that and they'll talk about that in a
little bit so complaining worked three
different times yesterday to get the
attention I needed which is weird I
don't I don't usually recommend
complaining I'm not a big complainer but
it totally worked three times anyway
four years today ago today do you know
what the anniversary is it's your
fouryear
anniversary of the beginning of the co
pandemic does it feel like four years
since the beginning of the co
pandemic that that was a long few years
in there wasn't it I think those are the
longest years of my life oh my God I
hated those pandemic Years anyway it's
over uh meanwhile an update on the tape
the tap Brothers appar apparently
they've been arrested
again uh in their Romanian country
they've been arrested on a UK
warrant that's based on charges that
were investigated first in 2012 and then
dropped but suddenly those charges are
back H how do you explain that how do
you explain that the Tates are in
renewed legal trouble you know years
after charges were looked into and
dropped well one possibility is New
Evidence definitely a possibility the
other possibility is this is part of the
larger trend of destroying any uh
persuasive voices who might be Pro Trump
now I'm not going to say that the Tates
are prot Trump because I don't know if
they are or not but you would assume
that their General Vibe and their
general what they believe in and
promote seems more compatible with you
know sort of a trump point of view not
I'm not counting their the way they make
money but uh they're political stuff so
do you think that the Tates are being
arrested because of some crime or do you
think it's
political what what do you think in the
comments do you think without even I
don't even know what the charges are I
don't know what the charges are I
couldn't find that in the news everybody
was talking about it but they didn't
mention the charges
so what do you think do you think this
is just
political I think it is yeah I I think
this is uh
political I think the United States and
maybe maybe Great Britain wanted to do
it on its own but I think we might have
twisted their arms to say you know what
these tap brothers are too influential
and they don't say things we like so
take them out now I don't have evidence
of that
zero evidence no evidence it's just that
it would be consistent with everything
else we've seen let me ask you this has
enough time going by that you understand
that my cancellation was
political you know that that was
political right does everybody know that
I don't know if that's obvious to
observers all right I'm just looking at
your comments to see if if that's coming
through all right uh you saw some
post on X talking about how there's no
such thing as a rich country that
doesn't have a lot of energy or use a
lot of
energy now uh I wanted to use that as a
jumping off point for this um I guess
it's a
reframe I believe that
war which ends up settling most of the
things in human history you know War be
is usually the big thing that changes
countries
I think war is really really just
economics war and economy are almost the
same thing uh not in effect but they're
same thing in in the sense that the
country with the biggest economy is
usually going to win the war the biggest
economy usually wins a war and what
gives you the biggest
economy usually access to cheap
energy so that energy is really the same
as at your economy because it's the
thing that has the most influence and
your economy is kind of the same as your
military in the sense that it has so
much influence on the other so when you
see for example a country like the
United States do what you think are
terrible dirty tricks and horrible
things and coups and and you're say it
seems all about the energy companies
we're doing this for the oil companies
well maybe we are maybe we are maybe
it's exactly that you know the oil
companies have a lot of money and a lot
of influence and so we just do what they
want but I would submit to you that if
we did anything else we'd already be
dead do you get that if we didn't go
just really aggressively on energy
especially in other countries I mean
basically overthrowing countries so we
we have a supply of you know oil
I me we're very aggressive about energy
but uh because of our aggressiveness
about energy and the fact that we're
lucky enough to have energy in this
company in this country our economy is
booming it's not the only reason but
it's a fundamental reason and then we
have the biggest military so it's all
connected so if you imagine that I guess
here's the point if you imagine that
there's a conversation about war that's
separate from the conversation about the
econom me that's separate from the
conversation about our aggressive energy
posture in the world stop that it's all
the same story it's all one thing it's
just different Windows into the same
thing well there's a uh a media company
that uh
went uh Had a Bad Day dead spin so dead
spin was one of these uh dingleberry
media companies that would do hit pieces
on me on a regular basis and uh so I
like to dance on their grave a little
bit there a company got purchased by a
European company who immediately said
they were going to fire every single
person in the company and just use the
assets so I asked this question what
would be a good name for a media company
that spins the news until the company is
dead spins the news until the company is
dead dead spin now I will also accept as
an answer CNN Huffington Post MSNBC all
good answers but the proper answer was
dead
spin now I'd like to share with you the
most
important uh story of the day it's about
a
sheep you're probably saying to yourself
how can that be important oh it's
important you have to see it to see how
important it is let me scroll down here
and find that sheep so there's a sheep
that uh has had found a lazy way to eat
grass it just it just sits there and I
don't know if you can tell but it's
munching the grass as it lays
there so it's actually eating eating and
resting at the same time see his little
mouth
munching and the reason I bring this up
is because stop
it the reason I bring it up is uh the
economy is so
bad that even the Sheep had to get a
side
job it's a side
job all right yeah also very important
uh if I were to own a
sheep um what would I name it I would
name my sheep James woy
Jr James Wy Jr who used to be the head
of the CIA but it' be a great name for a
sheep James get over here
um but uh somebody in the comments had a
better idea for the name of the sheep Ed
shean Ed
Sheeran damn it that's good damn it I
wish I'd said it all right but still she
pass a side job economy is bad all right
uh I love a good cannibal
story you know I'm not a nice person I
guess I guess that's all I can conclude
that whenever I hear a story about
cannibals my first thought is not for
the
victims my first thought is not for the
victims of the
cannibals I know it should be I know it
should be I know how I'm supposed to act
I just can't now my first thought when I
hear stories about cannibals is oh this
is going to be funny uh and sure enough
I was not disappointed so Ian miles
Chang who's got a big account on
xplatform he posted uh I just received a
request for comment from NBC News asking
me to prove cannibalism exists in Haiti
I wish I was making this
up and then he showed the actual uh
request it was from an NBC reporter and
the NBC reporter was asking is his
Source only the one article in the
British star/ Express with the one
unnamed
Source now I said to
myself is it possible that the entire
story about cannibals came from one
sketchy publication with an unnamed
source and we all just ran with
it did it all come from there I don't
know I I saw people in the comments
saying they'd seen
videos but I'm not sure I would believe
any video that comes out of Haiti but uh
I think it's hilarious that it's
entirely
possible that there were no
cannibals now is that as funny to you as
it is to me that we we could spend a
entire like two days news cycle talking
about something that's the just patently
absurd and NBC News just just figured
out maybe they should ask where it came
from
all right so I don't know if there's
cannibals in Haiti all I know is that
the criminal leader who seems to be in
charge of the whole island at the moment
his nickname is
barbecue and he doesn't own a barbecue
if you know what I
mean so some say he has that nickname
because he likes to light his opponents
on fire that's a
possibility or maybe he's a giant
cannibal I don't know nobody said he's a
cannibal it's just a funny
nickname uh and then other people have
suggested that uh if we if we uh allow
enough of the
cannibals if we allow enough of the
cannibals to migrate to the United
States it
will it will take care of the rest of
the migrant
problem so it it's sort of like when
they introduce wolves into an area to
get rid of the other
animals you can introduce some cannibals
into our ecosystem just is just to trim
the
[Laughter]
fat all right no we're not going to do
that all right NBC News is also
reporting that according to a poll
support for same-sex marriages has
actually
dropped it's actually dropped
so and the comments somebody's yelling
at me and saying that is not
funny well you know what's really funny
you telling me that's not funny that's
pretty funny anyway uh support for
same-sex marriages dropped researchers
from P rri I found so this among young
adults which is even more Curious it's
among young adults the ones who
supported same-sex marriage declined to
71% last year from a high of 79
in 2018 what do you think what do you
think
changed uh what do you think was the
difference in support for same-sex
marriages and why it
declined I have a
hypothesis my hypothesis I don't have
proof of this but my hypothesis is that
the entire decline in support for
same-sex marriage is from the people who
tried same seex
marriage it seems like that drop from 79
to 71 would be roughly the same as the
number of people who tried
it I don't know if you've tried
marriage all right let's just move on to
the next story no reason to beat that to
death um so you might be aware that um I
had some Choice things to say about Tik
Tock and the people who were opposed to
the
ban um and I thought the people opposed
to the ban May not be opposed to it for
uh pure political and ethical reasons
that there might be some monetary
influence and or maybe they're just
analyzing it wrong but um I had some
harsh words for V to his
credit he contacted me later on DM we we
follow each other on X so he could just
send me a private message and we
followed up and we had a little back and
forth I don't want to I don't want to
tell you anything about a private
conversation but um he alerted me that
he was going to do a live
stream and he would be addressing it
then so I watched the live stream and
I'll give you all my comments on it here
so I'll do my best to try to represent
his point of view which I I'm going to
apologize in advance because if you
heard his point of view You' know it's
it ju it's just wonderfully
complex like in a good way um and
nuanced and has lots of context that he
added about chinaese persuasion in all
other domains and stuff so it was a
masterful uh really it was quite
masterful and
impressive um explanation of the whole
situation and then his view of it so I
want to give you as best I can uh his
View and I hope I'm doing him credit and
not misinterpreting now normally the way
these things go is that I would now
misinterpret what he said so that I
could score my points you know that's
the normal way this goes right so the
next thing you know I'll say something
that isn't what he said and then I'll
mock it and it won't be what he said
that that would be the normal way this
kind of thing goes I'm going to try not
to do that I'm going to try actually to
you know maybe steal man his argument
and uh make it as strong as possible so
that if I say anything that's countered
to it it's a fair contrast so I'm going
to try to do it fairly I have I don't
have complete confidence I can do it
because his his uh intellectual grasp of
the entire domain is is pretty deep so
let's see if I can get anywhere near
it first of all he started off with a
long explanation that was very good and
really interesting about how China uses
access to its markets to influence
American companies such as the NBA uh
that uh need or want that Chinese market
and so they will bow to whatever they
want and he made a connection I hadn't
heard before that China wanted to you
know stir up a racial division in
America because it would take the
pressure off of China for their
treatment of the Wagers now I'd never
really heard that frame before and
hadn't heard that China might you know
be one of the influences behind black
lives matter now I don't know in what
direct ways that's true but it does kind
of make sense as a you know an influence
narrative because apparently China was
saying out loud that uh as long as black
lives matter is a thing um don't give
them any
advice so that's good context so we know
that China is uh trying to influence
America uh so that's um and and also
aake demonstrated his complete
understanding that
persuasion you know is a sort of an apex
concern so he was quite clear on that
all right so here are some other things
he said he he says he wants to ban on
social media under age 16 he said that
before and I like that I agree with
that and it would go a long way toward
uh fixing a problem because the younger
the mind the more easily corrupted it
could be you know if it were up to me
I'd extend it to
25 there's no chance in the world that
that could be approved but if people's
brains are not formed until age
25 do you want Tik Tok to be the thing
that forms it I mean because that
literally would be part of the formation
of your brain from 0er to 25 so you
could argue it should be uh an older age
but since that would never be approved
in our World 16's a good that's a good
place to start so I'm going to be
completely supportive on banning all
social media under 16 and I'll also say
that I would take a big junk out of my
concerns about
persuasion um I don't know if it's more
than half but a big chunk maybe
20% could be even 60% it's a lot I don't
know how to put a percentage on it uh
but it count
all right so here's some other things
that F said um he said that we can't
beat China by being like China another
words um if we were to put our heavy
hand on this specific company uh that
would be more like a Chinese way of
being than an American way which would
be more free market and U ban behaviors
we'll get to that so um and I'll give
you my counters to it uh as we go uh
can't be China by being China but what's
your reaction to that statement so we
want to keep our core American values
and not just throw them overboard
because we see China you know doing some
stuff we don't
like good point good point bad point no
point what do you think tell me in the
comments um my take is that it's a good
persuasion and it reminds me of uh you
know if the love fits you must equit he
repeated it a number of times and it is
one of those sticky persuasive things
because I don't want to be like China so
I'm already predisposed to liking this
idea that we can't beat China by being
like them I like oh I don't want to be
like people locking up Wagers I don't
want to be you know the government
putting too much of a finger on free
market so no I don't want to be like
China so can't be China by being like
China
however uh you know it's nonsense
right it's good
persuasion but it's not an
argument it's not even close to an
argument uh so let let me give you an
example of what I mean we don't we can't
beat China by being like China so for
example China is growing their military
right now so our best response would be
to shrink our military in response to
them growing their military
because we don't want to be like them
and they're growing their
military um if China spies on us and we
know they do our best response might be
to not be like them and spy on China but
to find something
else and if China has strong
borders we might not want to be like
that and we might want to just open ours
up now those are stupid examples that
have nothing to do with Tik Tock I'm
just saying that as a general claim you
can't be China by being like China is
absurd it's
absurd so from a persuasion perspective
it's really good like A+ for persuasion
on a logic level it doesn't have
anything it's completely empty of any
logic so I I uh uh I disregard that as
being something you should consider when
making the decision no we act like China
when it makes sense exactly like China
when it makes sense and when it doesn't
make sense for a national interest then
we don't act like China so the real
question is what do you do for the
benefit of
America you don't ask yourself what do
you do for a benefit of America that's
also incompatible with
China it's just it's a nonsense idea but
the he he had real he had real reasons
too that are stronger than that
one all right his best argument the
strongest I think that that wasn't
persuasion based but more you know more
nuts and bolts is that he prefer to ban
the
behaviors not the company so and part of
that argument is that our domestic
platforms uh might be doing something
that's also very bad so Facebook for
example maybe biasing their results and
trying to change things and that would
be bad behavior tick talk might be
trying to persuade America politically
or otherwise socially that might be bad
behavior so wherever there's bad
behavior just um put a control on the
behavior what do you think of
that um because it would be sort of a
Chinese thing to ban a company it
wouldn't be an American thing and if you
start Banning companies you know
slippery slope they'll ban you he didn't
say that but seems reasonable if you ban
them they ban you but I think uh our
social media is already
banned so um there's that so do you
think that we could ban the
persuasion behavior of tick tock what do
you think is that something we could do
is it a practical plan that we could ban
persuasion well this is probably where
he and I have our biggest um difference
in Assumption now I come from the I come
to the
persuasion um topic as a trained
hypnotist so I've written books on
persuasion when Biggle notably and I
talk about persuasion all the time and
it's sort of a lifelong study of mine
and like I said I'm literally hypnotist
so when I look at the field of
persuasion uh there's something I know
that maybe other people don't know and I
just assumed it was obvious so this is
not obvious at all so if V has never had
this thought maybe it's the first time
he's hearing
it you can't detect
persuasion so how do you how do you
monitor it or police it how would you
ever tell them to stop doing it when you
can't find it now you're going to say to
me I can find persuasion remember that
researcher Epstein who looked at Google
and he found that the search results
were super
biased that's persuasion and definitely
you could find
it now what do you do about it suppose
you found it so you go to Google and you
say hey stop this behavior and they're
going to say what Behavior it's just the
algorithm and then what do you do do you
get access to their algorithm and if you
did could you find the bias do you
remember the Twitter files when musk
started digging into what the Twitter
the old Twitter code actually did
it was so complicated and so distributed
you across multiple domains of people
who could influence it that you couldn't
even find all the places bias had been
programmed in it just wasn't even
findable so if they say it's not there
and that it happened
naturally how are you going to prove it
you can't be you'll never be able to
look at their code and know what's
happening because even if you found some
bias in the code and removed it just
like the Twitter files you would look at
your output and it kind of didn't change
and you'd say okay there must be some
other place in the code there's also
some bias and you might never find the
end of it because there's there might be
you know literally
hundreds of little tweaks that all move
in the same direction and you'd have to
find them
all now so I don't think there's any
practical way to to detect it based on
output because it you would never know
what's natural for example let's say a
lot of output was negative on
Trump isn't that because the news is if
the news is non-stop negative on Trump
and then you do a Google search it comes
up with more negative Trump stuff are
you going to say that the search was
wrong do you ban that behavior because
that behavior would be super biased it
would also be natural because they're
looking at the news to give you search
results
so in a real world you could never win
the argument hey this is bad behavior
you can't win that argument because the
other side just will have infinite
technical philosophical reasons why it
isn't and there's no objective standard
for it but there's a worse much worse
fear do you think you could detect my
persuasion do you think you can
what do you think you've been watching
me for a long time most of you most of
it's obvious and I usually call it out I
say I'm persuading on this you know I'm
persuading on Tik Tok for example so
usually I just call it out and then you
can see it but do you think that I could
fool you if I wanted to do you think I
have the skill that I could persuade you
and you wouldn't even know it was
happening of course I could it wouldn't
even be hard anybody with my level of
experience could do it everybody could
it is Trivial you would never know I've
told you before that I see the world
like a Harry Potter
book that there are Muggles and then
there are people who are trained in
Persuasion the people who are trained in
Persuasion are invisible to you just
like the
Wizards you see them but you can't tell
they have an invisible magic power of
persuasion
that sometimes they'll show you just so
you think you can see it all oh he
showed me all his persuasion I trust
that one
no they're not going to show you all
their persuasion they're just going to
do it so no there is no practical World
in which people who don't know
persuasion can identify it and that's
what you need and even experts who
looked at other people's persuasion
wouldn't necessarily be able to identify
it and if they did you wouldn't be able
to prove it
so for example I could look at you know
what some big platform does and i' would
have all kinds of opinions oh that looks
like persuasion but could I prove it
well I don't have access to the code I
don't know if it could have happened
naturally I don't know if it just
follows the I the opinion of the public
even if I don't like it so no there is
no logical practical way you can monitor
the behavior of the companies because
they can always say quite
persuasively this behavior is normal and
natural and we didn't do
it all right um for example suppose uh
your platforms said something about
either climate change or whether January
6 was an
Insurrection or a
protest so which which answer from
social
media would be persuasion and which one
would be just the truth well how can the
platform get that right if we can't
decide if I see the platform say uh all
the results are Insurrection for January
6 I'm going to say hey that's not fair
because that wasn't an Insurrection and
then the very next person who uses the
Google search sees Insurrection and says
those are good results right there
because definitely was an Insurrection
so that's what I did expect to
see so um I I hope I made my point that
if you are inexperienced in
Persuasion you might think that you
could monitor the
Behavior Uh I took as an assumption
which and I think it's my mistake that I
never said it out loud that you could
never you could never monitor the
behavior if you could it would be the
better way so let me say if there was a
practical way to monitor the persuasion
behavior of
platforms that would be probably a
better way but you would also have to do
it
immediately how do you do that see the
other thing about the persuasion of Tik
Tock and V made this point as well that
if you don't have data that says that
Facebook is is a worse let's say worse
risk to the United States than Tik Tok
if you don't have any data that would
suggest that why would you treat them
differently is that a good
point because even Trump was saying that
Facebook is enemy of the people and he
doesn't want Tik Tock to go away and
then all that traffic move over to to
Facebook because Facebook is anti-trump
and how is that making the country
better so that's not a bad argument
Trump's argument that the traffick would
just go over to another
enemy maybe but um I would argue that
you cannot compare um what a adversary
is doing or an adversary country's
product uh versus is a domestic company
in my opinion the Zuckerberg risk is
that we all turn into
Democrats I know terrible isn't it you
don't want that to happen do you oh my
god what what if all the Democrat
policies got put into effect well
Zuckerberg is not a crazy person he
wants the economy to work and the
country to succeed he he needs that
right his his Hawaii his new Hawaii home
that's being upgraded uh uh it's no good
if the country fails there's not a deep
enough you know bunker so Zuckerberg
doesn't want America to
fail I assume he's on our side he just
has a different idea what's good and
what's bad so even if you lost
everything to
Facebook you might hate you might hate
that
situation but we'd probably be still
still be a
country China might have a different
opinion China might be better off if the
United States were less important than
China
so um so that's a completely different
risk profile and the big problem with
the uh detecting persuasion is that you
might detect it but it might be too late
so remember that uh that researcher
Epstein I talked about who found all the
bias in Google he didn't find it the day
I happened he found it way later after
it already been done so if one of the
platforms did something that was let's
say Tik Tok did something that was
really persuasive and then later we
found and said hey you can't do that
they'd say oh we didn't know we did that
we'll stop doing that it'd just be too
late so on a practical sense you can't
monitor Behavior but you could make sure
that an adversary is not in the
game is that worth it is it worth
it just to make sure that the adversary
is not playing and would that be would
that be
American would that be consistent with
American values because this is AES
point would it be consistent with our
American values if we banned uh Tik Tock
after we saw them
persuading I don't
know I guess that's a judgment
call all right so I don't need any
evidence that Facebook has been know
worse than Tik Tok in the past because
I'm not living in the past I'm living
completely in the future and you don't
know and nobody knows will Tik Tock push
that heat button on something that will
be devastatingly bad for America in the
future I don't know will Facebook in the
future do something that's worse than
what they've done in the
past
maybe but probably only you know
preferring Democrats is it's not going
to be the end of the world um whereas
Tik Tock might want to weaker United
States in
general all
right and
um so that so let me uh let me just
summarize that so the main points are uh
VI wants to ban all social media from
people under 16 completely agree that
would make that would make a big
difference in the Tik Tock persuasion
um can't beat China by being like China
is a meaningless bumper sticker in terms
of how logical it is because whenever it
makes sense for us to be like China we
act like it just like anybody would so
that's the whole story when it makes
sense you do it you don't care what
China's doing um ban the behaviors
There's no practical way to ban uh
persuasion you'd never be able to detect
it in time and as far as Facebook being
as bad as Tik Tok I do agree that the
Facebook risk is is enormous and I do
agree that we don't have data I just
know that um if I'm walking down a let's
say a darkened alley late at night and I
see somebody coming toward me and it's a
family
member I'm not worried at all I'm like
well I suppose a family member could
murder me in this dark alley but they
don't want to too so I don't even worry
about it they have no incentive but
suppose it's somebody who's poor and has
a gun and doesn't know you well then
maybe they're going to rob you so yeah
um I'm way less afraid of somebody who
is directionally on my
team and Zuckerberg directionally he's
on my team he's an
American do I like all of his persuasive
stuff NOP nope nope nope
nope no all right so that's where we
were differing uh I think I have a
experience difference and so I know it
would be impractical to stop persuasion
and maybe that's the big difference uh
however I would like to announce today
that I am opening an account on Tik Tock
as soon as I get around to it might be
today or later and so I'm going to join
Tik Tok here's my
reason number
one uh it won't be banned
do you need do you need a reason for why
I say it won't be banned and the and the
fight's already
lost it won't be banned for 35 billion
reasons there's a gigantic
donor who owns 15% of Tik Tock who is
one of the main donors to
Republicans and I don't know maybe maybe
he donates to some Democrats when he
when it makes sense to him but as long
as that's the case that's way more money
than any political process is going to
overcome now one of the things V said he
is he he mocked people who were
suggesting that he was um flipflop or
not flip-flopping but that he was uh not
going hard against Tik Tock because
there was some financial gain for him I
I want to make clear that I've never
thought
that right and and then I worried after
I heard it I was like oh I hope didn't
sound like I was saying that I did say
that money is the reason and I did put
his name in that conversation and I'm
going to do it again because I don't
think that at any point there was any in
in my own mind I had no suspicion or
worry that he would take money from some
rich donor because first of all he
doesn't need it he pointed out he's
worth nearly a billion dollars
and no no no there's no way that vake is
being
bribed like I just doesn't make sense
yeah that would be like the same as your
family member in the dark alley they
don't have a reason right he doesn't
have a reason to take a bribe but where
the money influence is is on the
Republican party of which he is a big
supporter especially the the Trump World
so Trump definitely and
other big Republicans absolutely
definitely need money for campaigns and
they need money for baying off law fair
Maybe which is also a campaign expense
or it could
be so yes I think money's part of it but
no I don't think there's any chance that
V is you know taking some kind of you
know personal enrichment I don't I don't
think that's
possible all right so I wonder this
about the Tik Tock
ban I'm trying to
remember who were the first people who
said you should ban Tik Tock could you
tell me in the comments who who are the
first public figures you saw say it
because I kind of wondered if it was
me and so I did a search uh using grock
so that's the AI That's built into
X and it said that the first public
figure to bring up a band was Mike
Pompeo in
2020 does that does that sound like the
first place you saw it because my memory
is that it was
me but you know I I like to I'm a grand
Rio narcissist so I tend to remember
things about myself better than they
actually
happened but my memory is it was
me did anybody have the same memory or
am I literally just
hallucinating all right some I see at
least one person who thinks it was me
all right I don't know the answer to
that so when I asked grock here's what
it
said I I asked
literally um you know if I was one of
the first people and it said Scott ads
creator of the dilber comic has been
vocal about his concerns regarding Tik
Tok so far so good particularly in the
past year exactly however he has not
explicitly called for a ban on the
platform wait
what he is not explicitly called for a
ban on the platform instead Adams has
emphasized the need to address the
potential risk associated with Tik Tok
such as data privacy and security issues
as well as his influence on young
people um in a recent tweet on March
11th 2024 Adams expressed his concern
about Tik Tock stating Congress must be
owned by China to some degree because
the case for Banning Tik Tok is both
obvious and critical to the survival of
the United States and Gro goes on and
says he further argued that Tik Tok
poses a greater risk to America than
other issues such as Russia climate
change ran and next pandemic is
important to note that while Adams has
not explicitly advocated for Banning Tik
Tock he has consistently raised
concerns that's
right apparently
grock thinks that the person who
probably started the whole thing
isn't in favor of
it just hold that in your head for a
moment AI is erasing history in real
time let me say that again
AI is erasing
history and rewriting it in real time do
you think that'll get
fixed in the future are you going to do
a direct Google search or will you
always be talking to Ai and we're
probably just a few months away from all
searches would be AI this is what AI
thinks now remember this is an AI the AI
That's built into X that does not as far
as I know have a bias against me so
there there's no bias because I've tried
to see if there is any when I search it
it doesn't have any bias against me
but um this is completely
opposite the if it's
true that I was the first person to say
it public
figure and I don't know that's true I I
still need a fact check on that because
I got faulty memory but uh at the very
least I'm one of the most prominent
people who's been saying it should be
banned and it it says exactly the
opposite that I've never said ban it is
that scary to
you am I making too much of a big deal
about it just because it's about me or
does this scare the living out of
you that history is just being erased
now why in the world would grock have
this opinion it didn't get it from any
kind of a
surge or or did it make the opinion
based on what it didn't find I don't
know should it make that kind of
inference so that's
scary Thomas Massie is talking about Tik
Tock being a trojan horse and he says
that it give the president the power to
ban websites Not Just
Apps and uh
and the person breaking the new law is
deemed to be the us or offshore internet
hosting service or App Store not the
foreign adversary so in other words the
criminal would not be
China uh or even Tik Tock I guess um no
he could ban the
apps so they could ban the app but it
wouldn't be punishing China the
country
so do you do you buy that the President
should not have the power to ban
websites and apps under the
commander-in-chief
role
commander-in-chief should the
commander-in-chief be able to
ban um a website or an
app well the worry here would be that
the commander-in-chief being a political
animal would use this new power to do
things that you would not want them to
do and maybe they would ban a platform
that just says bad things about them
politically is that a
risk well here's my take on
it what the hell do you think the
commander-in-chief's job
is what do you think his job is or
her the job of the
commander-in-chief is to make decisions
that would be too hard or wouldn't make
sense to be done by committee because
there's so big and so important and you
don't need anybody but somebody who's
looking out for you to make the decision
and you got to do a
fast well that's what the
commander-in-chief
does now the thing the one good thing
about most of the commander-in-chief
stuff is it's public so if the
commander-in-chief says I'm G to I'm
going to take out this
terrorist well you might say to yourself
I'm not even sure that's
legal but you also say to yourself well
but it's definitely what a
commander-in-chief is supposed to do so
you let it go so I would say that if the
commander-in-chief used
commander-in-chief power to ban
something for purely political reasons
and everybody could
tell there would be such an uproar that
just couldn't happen and politically it
would be you know
suicide but if the president banned a
website that clearly was damaging
America would you have a problem with
that so remember that massie's point is
not that the commander-in-chief might
ban Tik Tock
specifically the bigger worry that he's
expressing just in this opinion
specifically is that it could be
overused I don't buy that because the
commander-in-chief is a position in
which overusing it is built into the job
description right you we do give them
the the power to do way more than you'd
expect you know would be part of I don't
know some legal structure so I I would
say this is normal and that the the
commander-in-chief has to not just look
at missiles and bombs but needs to look
at persuasion as a military
tool so yes it's a risk and yes um the
calling it a trojan
horse it's hyperbole but not too far off
if if we were not aware of this uh that
would be a fair statement and I don't
think we would have been unless he
pointed it out so so you could say
that's reasonable hyperbole in this
situation there's such a thing as
reasonable
hyperbole uh let me read this comment
here uh Scott I think you're wrong on
this imagine Biden and the complicit
press making the case that the
conservative Treehouse website is full
of domestic terrorist oath breaking
insurrectionists right so that is the
the risk that you're saying is the one
I'm
acknowledging that they that the
commander-in-chief could act in a way
that's purely
political but it would be suicide it
would be
suicide yeah so they could do that but
the political blowback it wouldn't be
worth it so the thing you count on is it
just wouldn't make
sense now is it a risk yeah it's risk
what would happen if Biden banned a uh
let's say a conservative leaning website
for being a dangerous source of
misinformation well the very next
president would ban a liberal website
and nobody wants that so there's some
mutually assured destruction going on um
and it's a known risk so I I will not
minimize the risk I just think that when
you're commander-in-chief it's your job
to manage gigantic
risks and this should be part of the
job yeah there are there are checks and
balances uh even within the
commander-in-chief job that's a good
Point yeah the commander-in chief can't
just sign anything and it happens right
there will be a giant bureaucracy that's
going to say uh if you do that do you
understand all the problems that that's
going to cause relative to what small
problem you solve let's take your
example if if Biden banned the
conservative Treehouse that's a
website
um that would be a tiny tiny little blow
to the entire conservative
ecosystem although you've heard of it I
mean it's a substantial entity but
compared to you know Fox News and all
the larger entities it's a small
percentage but the political blowback
from Banning a website primarily for
politics and everybody would see that
would be so big that the benefit you got
from silencing a smallish
website couldn't possibly make sense in
my opinion but yes it could be abused
anyway here's why I'm joining uh Tik
Tock
um it turns out that my biggest social
media account is on Tik Tok already it's
just
illegal so there's something called
Scott Adams official and it has 1.3
million followers and shares my clips
from the
show
illegally so uh I'm going to get on Tik
Tok with a separate device so Tik Tok
can't get into my stuff and then uh I'm
going to contact my lawyer and I'll have
my lawyer contact this account or or Tik
Tok and see if they'll transfer it to
me now they don't have to transfer to me
I don't think there's any law that would
require that but um I will lawfare them
uh to death if they don't so whoever is
running the 1.3 million followers is
obviously a fan
and if you see this and you probably
will um you should contact me and uh we
should talk about turning over the
account to
me um because that's the one way that
you can survive this because I'm not
going to go
soft yeah I only have two modes I only
have two modes which is well I don't
care and oh I now I have to I have to
make something happen so I'm in I'm not
in the uh flexible
mode uh I'm in the uh I'm going to own
this account or destroy it and if you
want to fight about it I'm up for that
fight so let's do that I will put all of
my attention into that fight so if you
want to fight and I don't think you do
because I think it's a fan account
literally a fan account uh if you'd like
to do what's good for me and uh you'd
like to Tik Tok people to see my content
I'll help you out with
that uh I'll make sure the content's
still there as long as I can monetize
it can you monetize on Tik Tok I don't
even know if you
can who knows the answer to that I have
so little uh Tik Tock exposure do they
monetize uh pay him for it jack off I
don't have to pay for
it why why would I pay somebody who
stole from me that's the dumbest
thing anybody ever
said
no uh if he had had permission it would
be
different uh but it's it's theft it's
just
left all right
uh the hill says that
37% uh of the people
surveyed um say Biden is respected by
world leaders that's an a Galla
poll
um do you remember when that mattered do
you remember when the news told us it
mattered that foreign leaders respect
our president and that you know because
it was trump it was going to be a big
problem do you think that only
37% of uh people thought that world
leaders respected Trump by the end of
his term I don't know so so why did this
go from the biggest problem in the world
to nothing now it's just a it's just a
poll result it's not the biggest problem
in the world suddenly yeah what
happened well maybe it's like BLM black
lives matter and all this police
brutality was the biggest thing in the
world until it didn't need to be and
then suddenly it just went
away well here's more evidence that um
our opinions are assigned to us by the
medium medium
they were happy to assign the opinion to
us that the respect of our president
among world leaders was a critical
critical
thing um and uh and now it's not doesn't
matter so yes we our opinions are
assigned uh there's more talk about the
Trump revenge tour and will he just get
in office and spend all this time and
resources getting revenge
uh but he's done a good job of um
reframing that as revenge is just doing
a good job he also reframes his quote
conservative policies he says he's not
really conservative that he has Common
Sense policies very good
reframe now you could argue how
technically true it is but if you're
running for president of the whole
United States I think it's a mistake to
say you have conservative policies you
know once you get outside the primary uh
you want the president to have common
sense and that's actually a strong
reframe I like that I I think everybody
is so disgusted with you know the the
Democrat versus Republican thing that
simply saying you're you're not just
doing everything conservative you're
just doing things that make sense and by
the way that actually fits because uh if
you take something like
IVF um Trump's in favor of it but the
you know there are some extreme I don't
want to say extreme there are some
members of the conservative group who
say no so he does pick he does pick his
policies so I think he does he does have
a claim that he is doing what makes
sense and not what is just
Dogma I think that's actually true it's
persuasion but I think it's actually
true um he's repeatedly pledged to
investigate Biden and his family after
he becomes president I guess again
um here's what I
think the fact that the Press wants to
call it Revenge if Trump gets into
office and then let's say initiat some
legal action against people who he
thinks deserve it does it feel like the
Press is priming us to see whatever
happens to Democrats is Revenge and not
Justice doesn't does it feel like
priming so so the the the comments on
here are whether I look more like I have
AIDS what was the other
thing yeah but basically the the
commentary is about my physical
appearance you you know that's not what
I lead with
right are you concerned that uh my my
ego about my physical appearance will
be um you're going to damage me
somehow I I have a
mirror I have a mirror I know what I
look
like you're commenting on every single
internal
thought is
amusing the cannibal clown jokes are
getting less funny every time you clowns
reword it
cannibal clown jokes you mean jokes
about cannibals and clowns or you just
don't like cannibal jokes there's some
people here who don't like cannibal
jokes apparently
anyway um there's another story that
says a litmus test for Trump's VP pick
will be what they say they would have
done if they had been in Mike Pence's
position about certifying the 2020
election and one of the better answers
was from JD Vance I'm not going to say
there's a right answer I'll just say the
better answer for both getting the job
and for communicating JD Vance has a
good answer he said he'd tell the states
to send more than one slate of electors
and he'd let Congress sort it
out now I don't know enough about the
process of the government to know if
that's a good idea or a bad idea I
really
don't but it makes
sense like as an answer to the
question it's pretty good see this is
the difference between was it an
Insurrection or was it a protest in
which we were trying to find out what
was
true the Democrats are unaware because
nobody will tell them that the the
so-called fake
electors um that the administ the Trump
people were trying to put together was
for the purpose of keeping their keeping
their option and making sure that
they've established a strong claim with
the knowledge that always has to be
worked out by the courts or the Congress
whatever right it's always going to be
some combination of the courts and the
Congress it's not like Trump could just
individually make a different slate of
elector
stick so I think you would have to not
understand how anything
Works to believe the claim that Trump
believed that Simply Having fake
electors would make him the next
president it would not and I don't
believe anybody believe that CU it's
absurd all it was was to you know
persuade and create the impression that
they have a strong claim buy some time
to look into some specific allegations
about the election which might have been
48 hours that's what they were asking
for and then they would either have uh
you know one slate of electors or the
other
certified so in other words there was
never anything that happened on January
6 uh in terms of the certification stuff
and the the electors that wasn't part of
our process the process allowed all of
it
right
so let's talk about
um oh the Haiti Prime M Minister
resigned he stepped down so ha he has no
government and uh he said well he he's
going to resign upon the creation of a
transitional presidential Council so if
they come up with a transitional Council
he'll step down I think the I think we
already have military over there the US
does so at this point um the US is
exerting control over it and we I'm sure
we'll get our puppet back in
play um well I asked on a uh another
poll on X today I said what's more
dangerous to America what's the bigger
existential threat climate change or
Dei and of course I won I don't know 90%
of the vote
now why is that well first of all I like
Alex Epstein's uh reframe that we
shouldn't be talking about climate
change we should be talking about
minimizing any risk of it so minimizing
the damage instead of stopping the thing
because you might not be able to stop
the thing maybe it doesn't need to be
stopped maybe warmer is better who knows
maybe some place is better some place
worse
but uh if you concentrate on keeping
people alive and and fed that makes a
lot of sense where if you say our
problem is the
change well then you do a bunch of crazy
stuff and real expensive stuff so it's a
good reframe to work on the uh let's say
the survival and the thriving of the
humans and not measuring the temperature
and trying to change
that all right uh but big story you
already heard it is that the reason we
can't have uh good things in America is
because the chips Act was was was
supposed to put a bunch of money
government money behind building
manufacturing for chips in the United
States so we didn't have to depend on a
little island off of China Taiwan and
apparently it's not
happening do you know why it's not
happening it's because the Dei
requirements uh and the chips act had 19
sections aimed at helping minority
groups including one creating a chief
diversity officer at the National
Science Foundation and several
prioritizing scientific cooperation with
what it calls minority serving
institutions and more and more and more
and more so anybody who's an
entrepreneur or has investment money
they look at this and they say well I
like the part about getting money to
help build a chip factory but I'm not in
any world going to agree to these
onerous um Dei requirements so we don't
get
chips so let me ask you again what is a
bigger existential threat to the
country that the climate is changing
slowly or that if something happens with
China we would lose access to all modern
civilization because we can't make the
chips which is a bigger threat it's not
even
close the these are not even in the
same
galaxy climate change might actually
kill people and that be a risk in some
future time it's far more likely we'll
figure out how to manage it than it is
that it'll kill us but we are
basically one order from president
XI that says don't get near Taiwan or
we'll sink your ship and our entire
civilization is
done that is a really really big risk so
Dei is destroying the
world uh and you say to yourself Scott
if Dei were such a problem it wouldn't
be just in this chips act you know
manufacturing thing you'd see it in
other domains you You' see it like
creating a a crisis of
incompetency not because uh minorities
have less competence but because the
math of it is the pipeline doesn't have
enough for the people want to hire so
necessarily because humans are humans
they will uh meet their objective of
diversity by hiring less qualified
people again not because minorities are
less
qualified but only because they're in
Shore Supply relative to the
demand so if that were the case and
that's all so bad I mean imagine what we
would see if that were
true I mean you'd see suddenly stuff
like I don't know like airplanes would
be having all all kind of maintenance
problems they never had
before and we're not seeing anything
like that you might see uh like massive
lawsuits being filed over racial
discrimination against white
people okay we are seeing a lot of that
coming on from uh Steven Miller's group
the America First legal thing they're
they're looking to sue over that so okay
well maybe the planes are having massive
maintenance problems and maybe there are
massive lawsuits being formed over
discrimination but I mean that those are
just a few items right I mean there's
the chips the
airlines the uh discrimination hiring
um but there's another story in the news
that there's a Kobe Bryant statue in La
I guess outside the stadium and there
are quite a few misspellings in the
placard a lot of
misspellings
H
um I don't know who made the Kobe statue
but I'm going to guess some Dei was
involved
maybe um and if Dei were such a bad
thing I
mean you could imagine that you wouldn't
even have access to and this is horrible
but imagine that the general public
would no longer have access to their
favorite comic
strips but we're not seeing anything
like that happen
so sarcasm
off all right do you ever wonder why so
many teachers are
idiots uh Robbie Starbuck reports that
if you apply to be a teacher in
Nashville's Public Schools you have to
aget all the racist Dei questions or you
or you can't get hired so they've got a
little test where if you don't basically
fully Embrace being a racist against
white people you can't get hired as a
teacher you actually have to prove in
writing you're racist against white
people or you can't get hired now you
would say Scott you're Miss
characterizing what it is it's really
just a bunch of questions that show that
somebody is let's say woke and cares
about diversity no it's nothing like
that it's pretty much proving that you
hate white people or you can't get hired
so you can look at it
yourself um and the other thing is funny
is the multiple choices only had the
choice of strongly agree or strongly
disagree
talk about putting your thumb on the
scale all right uh the her hearings are
happening uh H hearings so this is the
special Council uh who is looking into
Biden's retaining of those private
documents and the first thing I heard
about this is brand new so I don't have
details apparently in hers report it
says quote my team and I conducted a
thorough independent investigation we
identified evidence that the president
that's Biden willfully retained
classified materials after the end of
his vice presidency when he was a
private citizen willfully
retained classified
materials now that's worse than what
Trump did because my argument goes like
this Trump at least has a cogent and
reasonable argument a common sense
argument that when he was president he
had full control over what is
Declassified and the Very act of putting
them in boxes and taking them out is a
de facto classification now will that
argument work I don't know but if you
ask me from a non- lawyer point of view
does that make sense completely in fact
I'm pretty sure if the situation
reversed I would say oh okay if Biden
knew he was taking him and he was
President then that's a defacto
declassification and there's no specific
requirements of paperwork to declassify
for your president you just have to want
it Declassified and it is so it looks to
me that uh what Biden did was worse
because he was retaining things that had
never been Declassified or even de facto
Declassified in an arguable
way uh but he did not get um penalized
because we believe that her thinks he's
an old man uh and his memory is gone and
the jury would not convict
him all right uh Stephen A Smith do you
know Stephen A
Smith um he he's black which only I only
say because it matters to the story
um and I I'm not really familiar I guess
you mostly talks about sports and I've
had only
passing um exposure to him never had an
opinion one way or the other I just
didn't know his deal but he did a little
uh thre minute um speech on video in
which he is sort of mocking Biden for
you know making it an hour in a speech
and people acting like oh that's that's
all we need to know and the reason I
would recommend this is I don't know if
I've ever seen anybody give a better
presentation about anything oh my God
he's talented so um my statement here is
not about Biden I you know we've talked
about his energy enough but oh my God if
you want to say the best you could see
of just somebody making a point in three
minutes watch Stephen A Smith give you
the best body language
visual sarcastic
funny right on
point um presentation I mean I highly
recommend it so it's in my um my ex if
you want to go look at that really
really good job anyway
um apparently the hoax about Trump
wanting to grab the wheel of the Beast
the so-called Beast is the car the
president drives
in and Cassidy Hutchinson who had been
the chief of staff for Mark Meadow said
that uh she was she's so she's the one
who said that the the president not only
lunged at the steering wheel and that
the Secret Service had to grab his arm
cu Trump wanted to go to the January 6
protest but Secret Service wasn't going
to let him and
then uh Hutchinson said that he lunged
for the clavicle of the Secret Service
driver in other words like his neck
right clavicle just below the neck
and uh then we find out that there was
testimony from the actual Secret Service
who said nothing like that ever
happened the Secret
Service under
oath the Secret Service under oath said
it never
happened and of course you're all
familiar with that no you're not because
it turns out that January 6 committee
hid
that they hid it you don't think that
would be a little bit relevant to the
question of whether or happened talking
to the person that allegedly happened to
who is a seeker of service
and under oath and said no nothing like
that happened or he was not aware of
anything like that happened didn't see
it and he was obviously you would see it
so it seems to me that the January 6
committee should be in
jail no you agree if they
intentionally hid this
testimony there's got to be some law you
tell me there's no law that
allows there's no law that prevents them
from doing that there's got to be a law
I mean I would make up a law so if Trump
became president and he said 'l you just
made this up and you hid the
evidence that it didn't happen and it's
a horrible thing to the country and
we're going to put you in jail for it
would that be
Revenge would you call that
Revenge if the people who hid the
exculpatory evidence knew they were
doing it obviously they knew did it
anyway
again I don't know what crime it is but
you can always find a crime in these
situations I think they belong in jail
it's one of the worst things I've ever
heard in
politics this is in the top
1% of the worst things in American
politics what about the McCarthy
hearings not as
bad not as bad in my opinion not as bad
this is the worst thing I've ever seen
in American politics now that's assumes
that the facts you know stay the the
facts we
know yeah it's hard not to be in favor
of Revenge in this case but I wouldn't
call it Revenge because this would be
just the thing that should have happened
why do you call it Revenge if it's just
the thing that should
happen all right congresswoman uh T is
uh trying to get together some kind of
living wage for artist so that the ones
who don't make money on streaming and
other ways can make some money her claim
is that if you had 800,000 plays of your
song on
Spotify
um you would only be making the
equivalent of uh well nothing basically
um $15 an hour it'd be like a minimum
wage job can you imagine having
800,000
listens and you got paid you know like a
few hundred
dolls now compare this in the old days
if you were making an album you might
I'm just going to make up a number let's
say you sold it for 10
bucks uh people would pay $10 for one
album now you could pay $10 and again
I'm just making that up it's in the
ballpark for all the music in the world
forever $10 per
month so where did all the money
go it went to the streaming services so
the streaming services just basically
robbed the musicians of immense amount
of money because they could they just
could generally speaking whenever you
see that your work as an artist is being
combined with other people's work for
some distribution reason that's always
bad for the artists who are at the top
of the chain it will always be stealing
their money and if they agree to it
they're idiots but sometimes you get
forced into
it um I'm on Spotify for this as well so
Spotify just lowered my um my uh amount
income royalties whatever from Spotify I
don't know if it's a permanent change
because they're also moving me to a
different kind of advertising I move
from um what do they call it Ambassador
ads to they would place the ads
themselves but it went from uh well
decreased by
90% so my so what I was getting already
which was small
they decreased it by 90% but I don't
know if that's permanent I have to wait
a month to see if it evens out so yes I
would say that Spotify and the streaming
services when it comes to music or
podcasts
um I don't I don't like to use the word
fair but it would certainly make sense
if the better artists got off that
platform if they
could all right uh raspen says that
eight months after the uh before the
presidential election uh 91% of likely
us voters think the economy is the
biggest
issue uh almost as many 86% think
immigration related issues but that's
sort of tied up in the economy so that
makes sense um and then 71% say the
issue of abortion will be
important including 44% say it' be very
important what do you think you think
abortion is going to be very
important
probably so there was a Boe
whistleblower you said that Boe I guess
his claim was that they weren't doing a
good job of building their
planes uh meaning that it would be
unsafe that would be the claim from The
Whistleblower and he was found uh dead
of an apparent suicide by gunshot while
he was in his
car so do you think that's a coincidence
that The Whistleblower is dead of a gun
gunshot parent suicide well it could be
here's why I believe that being a
whistleblower and committing suicide are
largely
similar you don't become a
whistleblower until you have devalued
your own
life let me say that again you don't
become a whistleblower until youve
already devalued the value of your own
Survival because that's built in if
you're not willing to take that risk you
don't become a
whistleblower right it's you've devalued
your the value of your own life and
that's what suicide is so um you have to
ask the
question this is a pretty big
coincidence but on the other hand it
would be consistent with somebody who
had blown up his entire life and he just
said well I just threw away everything
to be a whistleblower and nothing
changed what would you do
you're a certain age I couldn't tell his
age 60-ish maybe you're a certain age
and you just threw away everything and
you got nothing for it you got
nothing and then he killed himself they
say that's not
crazy so we should all be concerned that
he got epsteined and I would certainly
I'd be investigating it like a possible
murder but
this is special case could have been a
suicide ran Paul is sounding the alarm
that Trump is endorsing Mike Rogers for
his run for office in
Michigan and uh this is what ran says
about Mike Rogers Donald Trump just
endorsed the worst deep State candidate
this cycle Mike Rogers is a never
Trumper and a card caring member of the
Spy state that seeks to destroy Trump
you have to ask yourself who gives Trump
this awful advice who's next John
Bolton good
question but I
assume if you know Trump being Trump I
assume he has taken all of that into
consideration and that whatever reason
he's doing it for uh is at least well
considered you know even if you don't
agree with it so there must be some play
here it could be that you know he thinks
Rogers will be on his side
and maybe will I don't know but uh that
concludes my amazing show for today
thanks for joining and
uh go forth and I'll see you tomorrow
morning same time same place thanks
everybody for
joining
