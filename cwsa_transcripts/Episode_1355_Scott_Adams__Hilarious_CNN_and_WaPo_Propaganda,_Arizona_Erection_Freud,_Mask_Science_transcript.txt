hey everybody
come on in come on it's time for coffee
with scott that was the best part of the
day
and if you're not wearing your pajamas
right now
you're overdressed because this is the
time to relax
have a little beverage and if you'd like
to enjoy it to the maximum
potential all you need is a cup or a mug
or a glass of tanker chelsea steiner
canteen junk or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee enjoy me now for them parallel
pleasure the dopamine
of the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and if you're not part of this you're
gonna feel bad in a minute
wow i feel sorry for you but for the
rest of you
go
sublime as always
so i finally figured out why biden is so
big on masks because
apparently kamala harris's tech team
they can save
50 of their work and resources because
they only have to see gi
biden from the top half of his head
bottom half you don't even have to
animate it
cgi is easy you can imagine the meetings
how are we going to do a cgi version of
biden we don't quite have the resources
to pull this off
and then somebody else in the room says
i've got an idea
just let me spit ball this what if
we never show the bottom part of biden's
face
and everybody laughs they go
no seriously seriously does anybody have
any ideas how we're going to be able to
cgi biden no seriously
if you just make everybody wear a face
mask
you won't even have to animate his mouth
that's the hard part and everybody in
the room just
says they just look at each other and i
think
can we do that we just need a reason
well i'm not saying that's what happened
no i'm not starting a conspiracy theory
i'm just saying that coincidentally it
would be easier to animate a cgi version
of
biden if he only had to do the top half
of his head that's all i'm saying
watching bill maher uh call on
black lives matter
and their and then the narrative making
properties of the news
is getting really fun because
i think i think bill maher probably
realizes
i can't read his mind but he probably
realizes that
the democrats really need some kind of
adult
supervision and apparently with great
power
comes great responsibility
and i think people like bill maher just
think if i don't do it
who the hell is going to do it and by it
i mean call on his own team
when they've just gone into crazy land
so he's starting to do that
calling on the the let's say
the left's
narratives if you will especially around
police shootings
you know he's being completely
fact-based
and realistic and it's fun to watch if
you're not watching a show i recommend
it
it's uh without without trump being the
only story
uh the the distorted effect of trump on
the media
is sort of reduced a little bit now you
can see now you can see bill maher
as he was meant to be you know without a
trump in the story
um here's a question for you
if you could invent a an electronic
device
that would emit some kind of electronic
signal
that when you pointed it at a person
it could make that person dumber maybe
even give them brain damage
you've heard that there's there's some
kind of a sonic weapon
that is allegedly being used against our
diplomats
not quite confirmed but suppose you
could
invent such a device where just some
kind of electronic signal would actually
make people stupid
and literally cause brain damage what
would you call it
yeah you'd call it cnn and that's not
even a joke
because if you haven't heard me say this
before science
now has determined fairly conclusively i
think
i mean you always wait for confirmation
but i think it's fairly solid
that people who watch uh only one side
of the news
and don't get the other side have brain
damage
actual literal that's the word no
hyperbole
scientists use the word words brain
damage
meaning that you can't think as well
because the
the bias of the news has actually warped
your brain
now let me ask you this
if we knew all this let's say
science was was always where it is now
and we always knew
that biased news would cause brain
damage
would it be legal to start cnn if it
didn't already exist
and think about it there are a lot of
things that could not be
legal if you started them today
for example if we didn't already have
lots of
guns in the united states let's say just
nobody had any
would it be legal to start having them
and not a chance
not a chance if we didn't already have
them
it wouldn't be legal to to start it up
tomorrow
yeah alcohol perfect example if it were
not
historically embedded in our society
no no it wouldn't be legal right
and you know you i know you're talking
you're going to be thinking about
prohibition didn't work
blah blah but that's because it was
already here
if somebody had just invented it and ran
it through the fda
it probably wouldn't get approved so
and i was thinking this about this with
dogs
i was walking my dog snickers and of
course you know snickers does their
business and i've got my little bag and
i'm picking it up and i'm thinking to
myself
if dogs were not part of our culture for
for so many years and somebody came up
with the idea hey
let's have a dog it'll live in my house
and it'll poop on my neighbor's lawn but
don't worry
i'll clean it up sometimes i mean i'm
pretty good at that but
other people maybe not so good i don't
think dogs would be legal
i don't think so i mean you can't have
just any kind of livestock you want you
can't have an elephant
can you well maybe you can i don't know
could you have an elephant
as a pet if you wanted to maybe you
could
actually i'm not i'm not sure you
couldn't i guess i suppose it depends
where you are
uh i i grew up with a neighbor who had
elephants
true story uh where i grew up in
windham new york upstate new york my
uh my grandfather's farm which was in
walking distance from
my house the the farm that was just sort
of
adjacent to his they owned elephants
apparently they were trained elephants
that they sort of provided to circuses
and stuff
but one day my grandfather was working
in the hayfield
and he turns around and there's a an
elephant that walks up to him
in upstate new york true story all right
but that's neither here to there i'm
just saying that
things like boxing cigarettes alcohol
dog ownership
and cnn all have this weird quality
that if you do if they didn't exist and
you started them today
somebody knows the catskill game farm
hey patty
the catskill game forum i don't think
that was part of why my neighbor had
elephants i think it was for circuses if
i recall
all right so
here's a little interesting fact i've
noticed lately that some of the best
and by best i mean diverse sources of
news
is my own community within locals
so if i look at the if i look at fox
news homepage and then look at cnn
homepage
there's a certain set of stories that
you know half of them overlap
and half of them are just you know in
their narrative
but they're all kind of
narrow it's just not a lot of breadth
in the in the coverage it seems but if i
go on locals
where you know i'm posting my more
provocative content
subscription service and other people
are in the community are posting
as well i see all kinds of stories
that i didn't see in the regular media
now they're in some kind of media
because they're linked
but they tend to be in you know not the
the tier that you see the most
here's an example uh chinese authority
is a story
i didn't know about until i saw it on
locals a link to it
chinese authorities are cracking down on
feminist activists online
in china and dozens of social media
accounts got shut down
um and the story said until very
recently you could see vibrant
discussions on women's rights
online in china now they just got rid of
it
now it's starting to look like china's
censorship is getting as bad as
our censorship in america and i don't
know if china's worried about that
but um it's heading that direction
and if china's censorship gets any worse
it's going to get up to american level
and that's going to be pretty bad
what oh oh you think chinese censorship
is worse than in america
oh that's so cute yeah a lot of people
think that
but let me give you this just this
example
in china they said you can't say that
and here's why and we're going to close
you down
you can't say it because it's bad for
china i guess
that's kind of it's kind of honest isn't
it
now i don't like it i certainly wouldn't
want anything like that
in america but it's kind of direct
this kind of language is bad for china
so we're not going to let you do it
wait a minute we do the same thing here
don't we isn't there a topic
i'm not even going to mention it is
there a national topic which you would
expect even a few years ago you could
have spoken
your opinion on with complete complete
freedom
but now you can't there are entire
topics
you can't talk about on social media in
the united states you'll get cancelled
so china is worse
i don't know it looks kind of similar to
me
and if you think it's worse maybe you
haven't been paying attention
because the other thing that's happening
is the the massive propaganda that
that is disguised as news
so probably twice a week or more i tell
you to watch glenn greenwald because
he's just ripping the media apart
for being a propaganda organ and no
right now nobody's doing a better job
of of uh just pulling the cover back
on the ridiculousness of the media
but this is i guess on fox news glenn
greenwald was
appearing and he was talking about how
washington post
apparently did some kind of a fact check
on tim scott
senator tim scott's story of being a
young black man who i know his family
picked cotton or something that's that's
the story
and i guess they fact-check it to make
sure that
he's an adult black man now but they
fact checked to make sure that he was
ever once a younger black man
apparently he was so he's always been
black
so they fact checked that i'm just
kidding they didn't fact check that
but they did they did write a fact check
uh that they found everything he said
was true
but they wrote it in a debunking tone
so that when you're reading it you feel
like it's being debunked
but they confirmed everything now you
say to yourself
wait a minute that's not a thing is it
can you do a fact check
in which you fact check something is
true but you
write it so that somebody thinks maybe
you're not
is that really a thing yes i gave you an
example yesterday
the usa today fact check on trump saying
you know about the disinfectants
they fact check it's true
that trump was referring to a real known
technology for
injecting light into the body it was
being trialled at the time
but they wrote it like it was false
but they fact-checked it as true it's a
thing
it's a real thing that they fact check
things as true while writing it like you
think it's the other way
it's amazing when you see it all right
here's here's another uh
great one like this perfect example
today you can see
a piece on matt gates
now we know from project veritas
undercover video
that talked to technical director of cnn
undercover
uh it was undercover video he didn't
know he was recorded
and he admitted that they target matt
gates
for political reasons has nothing to do
with the news
so so we know that they target matt
gates all right
so start with that knowledge that it's
not real news
it's it's a target at a person right now
knowing that
that's your framework listen to what
they did to him today
this is just it just makes your head
shake
it's now it's now passed into just
parody i mean it just looks funny at
this point
so here's from cnn federal authorities
are looking into whether
a 2018 trip to the bahamas involving
republican congressman matt gates
and several young women was part of an
orchestrated effort to illegally
influence gates
in the area of medical marijuana people
briefed on the matter
told cnn in other words
anonymous sources they're the good ones
aren't they
if you hear the cnn has some anonymous
sources
you know you're hearing the truth no
anonymous sources means not true
pretty much most of the time not every
time
so so let me read this again
and then i'll give you the punch line
right you have to hear the exactly the
cnn's words and then i'll tell you the
punch line
federal i'll read it again federal
authorities are looking into whether a
2018 trip to the bahamas
involving republican congressmen back
gates and several young women
was part of an orchestrated effort to
illegally influence gates in the area of
medical marijuana
people briefed on the matter told cnn so
that's
that's how they introduced the story
what do you think was the
the evidence in the story to support
this claim
none none there wasn't any
even even the anonymous sources
didn't say there was any crime nobody
did
nobody involved in the story has even
made
an allegation do you get that
there's not even an allegation
not only is there not a crime nobody's
accused him of a crime and there's no
evidence
whatsoever that anybody ever will it
gets better
wait it gets better and the idea here is
that he may have been influenced
to vote in favor of america medical
marijuana
his track record has always been
in favor of legalizing medical marijuana
he has
introduced legislation repeatedly
on that point so we have this long
history
where there's nothing to influence
because he's always been in that camp
you don't need to convince somebody to
do something that they've been trying
really really hard to do
for years now
don't you think that was important don't
you think that's sort of an important
context that he's actually famous
for years trying to get medical
marijuana
you know more more legal
at some point he takes the trip and then
people are suddenly investigating
whether they're trying to influence him
this is this is just hilarious
propaganda
i mean this is just crazy
all right um
i know that you don't like to hear about
masks
but i promise you this will be good
you're tired of masks i get it i get it
right
we just argue do they work do they not
but this is the most
insightful um
let's say credible explanation
of why we think they don't work but
probably they do in some cases
are you ready because we're trying to
reconcile why it is
that there are a number of
a number of uh trials or tests or
whatever that showed that they don't
work
but those are specific situations so
are there situations where they work and
here's one doctor
who looked pretty good uh dr pierre
corey is a doctor he's a researcher etc
and he broke it down this way and i
think this has a lot to do with
how well you explain it and he basically
says that masks
can have a value so long as
and and hold with me here because this
is it's going to get a little detailed
but not too bad
the masks do work
for indoor stuff only so this doctor
admits that wearing masks outdoors
ridiculous but we're all on the same
page on that right
masks outdoors there's no scientific
evidence that you can even get it
outdoors like there's one
there's one case verified of two chinese
guys
who talk to each other in the face for
an hour outdoors
nobody else so we're all on the same
page that masks don't make sense
outdoors right
but indoors some of you still think
indoors doesn't make sense
because you've seen you've seen tests or
trials or whatever they said they didn't
so this doctor breaks it down and i've
never seen it done so well he mentions
the four d's
that if you that mask will work indoors
he claims
unless you violate one of these four
things
and if you violate more than them then
the mask won't work
number one density if you have a lot of
people in a room
says this doctor then masks can
extend the amount of time before you
might get it assuming somebody in there
has it
right so all the mask does according to
this doctor
is extend the amount of time you could
be in a full room
before you get it anyway now the
argument is
that the masks make the the what would
you call it the air particles
or the water particles or whatever go up
and down and that basically they they
permeate the room
so it's not so much that you're you're
like a cannon
talking into somebody's face with your
covet it's more like
it's spreading into the room all right
so visualize this
it's the difference between me talking
directly in your face
and it's like a water cannon of covet
versus i'm just releasing it slowly into
the room through the tops of my mask
and it's just sort of filling the room
with virus
over time so here's the thing
if you violate any of these you're going
to get some covet even with a mask
indoors density number of people in the
room that's bad
the more people the more risk duration
the longer you're in the room the worse
it is the masks will extend
we don't know how much extend
uh the amount of time that you can be in
a in a room
uh dimensions the size of the room
obviously the bigger the room the better
and then the draft the amount of air the
airflow
so if you don't get if you don't get all
of these things right
the mask won't work and when they test
masks they're not really testing it in
the way they would get to this right
so this claim and i'll say it's one
doctor researcher who's making a claim
i won't say this is my opinion but it
matches exactly my opinion
all right the reason that i like this
this breakdown is it matches exactly
the opinion i've had for a year which is
there's no way it works
in every situation but it must buy you a
little time
that i've always figured it was a
friction thing that it's not binary it
doesn't stop anything
it just gives you a little little extra
time a little extra
cushion so because i was
primed to believe it anyway i do believe
this doctor
but i'm probably yeah
so in the comments you're saying so
confirmation bias
exactly yes i can't tell the difference
you know the way confirmation bias works
is that the person experiencing it
is the only one who can't tell you might
be able to tell
by observing me if you had you know
enough context to do that
but by definition if i'm suffering from
it
i'm the only one who can't tell so when
you say is that confirmation bias
i don't know it's not possible for me to
know
it's only possible maybe for somebody
else to know
all right uh here's a fun story
there's a arizona erection
freud now those
words are not exactly the words that the
story requires
it's not really an erection they use an
l in that word instead of an
r and it's not really a sigmund freud
it's a different word but i don't want
that to be picked up and
demonetize me so let's say in arizona
there's
an erection freud going on
and uh cnn's headline for it
is that and i swear this they really
said this
uh it's an effort by conspiracy
theorists
to undermine results that's how cnn
reported on the arizona erection freud
it's a conspiracy theorist attempt to
undermine results and i thought to
myself that's an interesting way to put
it
for example i'm going to start adopting
this this way of talking
when i go to my doctor
the purpose of going to my doctor is to
undermine my health
that's why i do it why else would you go
to a doctor other than to undermine your
health
when i check the tires on my car
what i'm really trying to do is
undermine their proper inflation
that's why i do it why else really
and when i go to the gym it's of course
to undermine my fitness
this is why we do these things so if
you're going to be checking the votes in
arizona
it's to undermine undermine the
credibility of the system that's why you
do it
everybody knows that so that's how cnn
phrases it
here's the funniest part do you know why
democrats are complaining about this
erection audit do you do you know why
they're complaining
this is the fun part democrats are
complaining wait for it
that the audit is not
wait for it transparent enough
is that beautiful that's just beautiful
yes that's right although the election
itself
some complained some on the other side
of the aisle
some complained that the election itself
was not
transparent enough and so they proposed
this
massive audit and democrats are
complaining that the audit is not
transparent enough and you know what
it's not it's not transparent
apparently the people doing the audit
are not going to let people watch etc
do you which what's your take on that
well besides the fact that it's freaking
hilarious
now um of course we all know because
we've been told
that the audit won't find any
irregularity
you know why right a lot of you are not
logical
so let me connect the dots for you the
way um cnn has done for me
and and follow this because a lot of you
are not trained
logicians so this might be a little
complicated for you and
try not to get lost we know that there
won't be anything
found in the in the audit and we know
everything's good
and you can go back to trace why we know
that
because when the courts were asked to
not look into it or they didn't look
into it
they didn't find the thing that nobody
looked for
and because they didn't find anything
that they didn't look for
that logically qed means that there
isn't anything
there because one way to know that
something doesn't exist
is to not look for it and that confirms
its non-existence
you're following this right because i
a lot of people will think wait a minute
that doesn't even make sense
but that means you're just not following
the logic if you don't look for it
or you use the wrong mechanism to look
for it
and then you don't find it that's proof
it doesn't exist
qed all right
so part of this uh erection
fraud audit is they're gonna take some
ballots and then go knock on doors
and see if there are any real people
corresponding to those ballots
what would happen if they find
there's a difference hypothetically
you know of course i know that they
won't and the reason i know they won't
is that the courts who didn't look into
it said it's not there
so i know they're not going to find it
but hypothetically just do a mental
experiment
what if they did what if they did
but it's not transparent
well if there's not if it's not
transparent i guess the dems will say
but you you added those ballots yourself
those are not part of the original
ballast you probably added them yourself
i suppose there's always some some way
that even an audit could be faked so
the dems without their transparency
you're going to be claiming that
but i'd be really curious how this turns
out
and by the way why don't democrats want
this to happen
now part of the pushback
is that they think that the audit will
be done
let's say illegitimately and maybe cause
confusion
maybe but you think
that democrats would want an audit
because the vote went their way
and they also want you to believe it was
a credible vote
i would think they'd be dying for an
audit do you know if
i knew i were innocent of all charges do
you know what i would want
and audit i'd want an audit if i were
innocent
now this assumes that the audience
doesn't create some fraudulent claims
so that is a risk they do have a
legitimate point there
you could easily imagine that it
confuses the public and
doesn't tell us anything that would be
you know not that
unusual but i would say that's a risk
worth taking
um apparently uh good news coming out of
israel that the
that for the first time this was
yesterday for the first time in 10
months
no israeli died of cove at 19 in the
last 24 hours
now today's a new day so maybe that
changed but there was a day
yesterday when israel had no covenants
and they've been vaccinated vaccinating
like crazy you know the
i guess the best success story in
vaccinations
so that's looking pretty good for the
vaccinations
pretty good for the vaccinations
meanwhile
the uh temporarily halted j j
vaccination has been reapproved
for use so apparently the risk is
much smaller than the benefit and that's
the single shot one
that's the one i want i talked to
somebody who
got vaccinated in in my area recently
it took five hours it was a
five hour wait in their car
to get vaccinated five hours
so i'm not vaccinated and it's only
because it's just not really practical
so you you can use all the websites and
all the places that you look for where
your vaccinations are
and you can sign up for things but none
of it works
so in california i don't know how
anybody gets vaccinated unless
unless they take days off so this is
somebody who probably had to dedicate
one full day to getting the first shot
one full day to getting the second shot
and then might lose one or two days for
the side effects
that's four days of lost work
for a freaking shot
i need better than that you know i don't
mind taking an
afternoon off but i'm not gonna give up
four days at work for a
vaccination all right california needs
to
step it up a little bit yes i know in
other places
it's shorter and i know that if you can
somehow magically get an appointment
close then you don't have to wait
forever but
not everybody can just go sign up you
can sign up all day long and
in fact all the places they look for
vaccinations right now
will tell you that you can get it and
you're going you're doing the sign up
and
you're saying your age and all your
comorbidities
and you get all the way to the end he
goes all right and here are your options
and none of them work so so you can use
a website to find
options that don't work but that's all
they do
so right now it's not really practical
where i live but people are still doing
it takes him five hours
here is an interesting point on
racism john blake it's an opinion piece
i guess it'd be an opinion piece on cnn
says that the the real problem with the
floyd case and chauvin's body language
etc
was that it displayed indifference and
that there's apparently a
a line of thought that goes all the way
back to
and includes martin luther king that the
real
worst racism is indifference
indifference to somebody's struggle
specifically
and and you've heard this before right
you've heard
a number of black people who
you know speak out on this kind of issue
to say that they'd rather
deal with a direct racist because at
least they're paying attention to you
you know at least you have something to
work with there but the ones that are
the
the worst in some ways are the ones who
are just indifferent
you know they don't care one way or
another whether you live or die
and so that makes sense in terms of
black lives matter
they're not saying well it's
just perfectly on point that's why
that's why i think there's
a lot of genius in the phrase black
lives matter
as a slogan i i doubt anybody's ever
come up with a better one
even make america great again didn't
didn't work as well as this one
even if you don't like how it turned out
but it certainly worked
and you know i was thinking about that
and part of the story is that
there's a presumption here hard to prove
but a presumption that
chauvin's body language when he was
photographed
on top of floyd that his
look of indifference was the most
triggering part about it
in other words his body language looked
like his mind was saying he doesn't care
if this guy lives or dies
which might be the case but did he go to
did chauvin get convicted because the
jurors believed they could read his mind
based on his body language
somebody says only in one photo but
apparently that one photo was
um it was focused on by the prosecution
so did we just send a man to prison
based on the belief that jurors can read
body language and determine
intention i feel like we did
feel like we did and of course you can't
read minds
so if there was anything that would ever
give you reasonable doubt
it should be that you can read
somebody's mind
what would be more reasonable doubt than
thinking you could read somebody's mind
by their body language have you ever
tried that at home
next time you look at your spouse's body
language
see if you can guess what they're
thinking see how well that goes
sometimes you get it right maybe one and
three
two out of three times you're completely
off we're not really good at reading
body language
it's not really i mean i believe that
maybe experts can do it
more often than chance i mean i believe
that's reasonable
but it's not a reliable way to send
somebody to prison
i think his body language says these
lions
but we do it's it's part of the process
the only way we know people are lying is
just by
looking at them and judging whether it
looks like lying unfortunately
um but i would like to add this
provocative thought to the process
that wanting to be uh let's see what's
to wanting to overcome indifference is
something that you control
right are you indifferent to to people
who
are nice to you are you
if somebody knocks on the door and says
hey um
you know i noticed uh it snowed last
night and i've got a few minutes
i know you're elderly do you mind if i
um
shovel your walk for you i'm here anyway
if that happens
do you think that the person who offered
to shovel your sidewalk for nothing
nothing in return does that are you
indifferent to that person
no you're not you actually care about
that person because they did something
for you the way to make people
not indifferent is to do something for
them
people who don't do anything for you
you can be indifferent to them
it's sort of natural so i feel as if
everything comes down to this that if
you have an
attitude of uh you know zero sum
attitude
that for somebody to get something
somebody has to lose something
that you end up with indifference
because if the only way you're going to
get ahead is by taking my stuff
i don't care about you i don't care
about you at all
i really don't and i'm not going to
change that opinion
if the only way you think you can get
ahead is by taking my stuff
i do not care if you live or die sorry
now if you would like to work with me
find a way we can both benefit i'm so
in i'm totally in if you can find a way
that
even something is just good for me
i'll probably return the favor it's
called reciprocity
it's reciprocity yeah and somebody
somebody says no empathy
no no i don't have empathy for people
who want to take things from me and give
me nothing
you know unless it's a child or a dog or
something like that right
but an adult human being who wants to
benefit by taking something from me
no i don't care if they live or die and
i never will
if they want to work with me
i i'm all in you know i'm very generous
but you have to you have to come at me
with a sense of reciprocity
and if the only thing i get out of it is
that i feel good
that works i'm good with that if the
only thing
i get out of is thank you works for me
i do a lot of work just for thank yous i
do lots of work just for recognition
so if somebody you know pat me on the
back and say good for you
good for you but i don't think this can
ever change because human nature is sore
to hardwired
that you know racism is sort of
hardwired into us we have to work pretty
hard to overcome it
but this reciprocity thing is also
hardwired
and if you're not coming at me with
reciprocity as your
your theme i don't give a about you
i really don't i don't care anything
about you or your life
i care nothing about you
clear enough but if you want help i'm
all about it
i understand although i did not see this
in person
that uh floyd's defense lawyer nelson
he did use the defense i had suggested
would be
effective but it didn't matter you know
the the
the jury probably didn't use the facts
anyway but
um his part of his defense was
that why did shove him do everything he
did right in front of witnesses with
cameras
if chauvin had had any idea that what he
was doing would get
chauvin in trouble he wouldn't have done
it would he
do you have to be a mind reader to know
that people don't do things that are
so bad for themselves that they would
end up in a seven
by ten jail cell 23 hours a day
for decades because that's what's
happening to shelvin
and he had to know i mean if you're a
police officer
you know that if you kill somebody in
front of witnesses
and there wasn't a good reason for it
you know that's not good for you
but apparently that argument that nelson
did use
did not of course did not sway the jury
but again they they were not really
fact based i don't think um
what do you think about the question of
whether you should wear a mask after
vaccination
there's a doctor amesh
let me see if i can read his name right
adelsia
dr amash adelija and he's a senior
scholar at the center for health and
security blah blah blah
blah so he's got some credentials
and he says that the preponderance of
evidence
supports the fact that vaccinated
individuals are not able to spread the
virus
so good news right so
here's a real doctor who's really looked
into it so you and i don't have to be
the doctor and we don't have to look
into it
and he says that the preponderance of
evidence is that
you're not going to spread it if you've
got the vaccination
now i don't know how that squares with
the j and j
shot being 77 effective and the other
ones being
95 or whatever effective
if something's only 95 effective or 77
percent effective
how does that prevent you from shedding
it
you know in some cases but apparently
the
they're the actual real world
cases of it happening must be so small
that it's almost not a thing
but here's the bad news you're waiting
for the bad news as uh
dr adalgia says vaccinated people
probably don't need masks he says his
opinion
but the cashier doesn't know who is
vaccinated
that's the problem isn't it the store is
going to make you wear a mask anyway
because they don't know who's vaccinated
so whether you have a passport or not
and i think those will be
you know found illegal in most states
passport or not
the store is going to say we don't know
wear your mask
you're only going to be in here for a
few minutes anyway so
if i had to predict i think that there
will be sort of a
tipping point in which people just won't
wear the masks
and if you want to sell stuff you're
going to have to drop the requirement
so i think stores at some point are
going to
ask you to be vaccinated or amassed but
they're not going to enforce it because
they just can't
and they don't want to run out of money
you saw what happened to coca-cola when
they said
things that conservatives didn't like
it's not good for business it's really
not good for business
and at the moment a store can still get
away with making you wear a mask right
you're not going to hold it against the
store
but once you're vaccinated and all your
friends are vaccinated
and then you go to the store and you
still have to wear the mask
you might go to a different store that's
not going to ask you to do it
so i think market competition is is
gonna
is gonna get pushed and pushed and
pushed until just something breaks
and the only people that will ask for
masks are people who you just don't have
an
easy option to go somewhere else so i
think market competition will get rid of
masks in
a few months a very interesting thing is
happening with gun control
and i did not see this coming which is
that even
if the federal government puts more
restrictions on
guns guns the states
can just refuse to enforce it because
they can refuse to put resources
in that way so it doesn't make it legal
they just won't reinforce it and i guess
they have that option
so to that point we've got
i guess four different states who are
moving that direction are already there
so arizona basically they're not going
to enforce any
new gun restrictions or something along
those lines
oklahoma something like that arkansas
something like that
montana something like that so
i'll tell you the one thing that is
predictable about the world
it's not predictable if you told me that
the
that the states yes basically it's a
sanctuary city
for guns that's exactly what it is it's
a sanctuary city for
earth state for guns if you had told me
that this
was something that might have happened i
wouldn't have seen this coming at all
uh it's so hard to make a straight line
prediction about any kind of slippery
slope
this is why i don't believe in the
slippery slope
all right things do go in the direction
until something stops them
that's true but you can never predict
the thing that will pop
up to stop it i wouldn't have predicted
this
and it looks like it's pretty solid i
mean it looks like pretty good play
all right they did that in kansas quite
a while ago
and people still went to jail somebody
says yeah there must be cases in which
let's say there's a somebody has a
firearm
in commission of a crime i would imagine
that that still gets enforced
wouldn't you um
all right because the news is a little
bit
light today i thought i would take some
questions because i know you have some
is there anything that you were
wondering about
that you said to yourself you know i
can't sleep until i hear what scott says
about this
would you like to accuse me of anything
or
challenge me on anything
here's one so the right land right lane
bandit says the 60s sexual revolution
became turned into full-fledged
transsexual rights
and and
progress is something that does go on
forever
so if my progress is your slippery slope
is it a slippery slope because i'd like
to see
full equal rights for everybody who's an
individual
as long as you're not bothering me or
breaking the law
why should i care what your sexual
preferences are
why isn't my business what your
genitalia is
or your genetic makeup why is any of
that my business
so yes when something is a good idea
it does keep going if you're going to
call that a slippery slope that's more
about your
impression of where it should go has
nothing to do with the quality of the
thing
and yeah i think that there'll be enough
pushback on the
the issue of children that that's
probably where that's probably where
things will stop i would imagine
uh when does kamala take over you know i
if i'm if i'm being objective
biden's doing a strangely good job
you know maybe better than i expected
the stock market's up uh he's starting
to tighten up on immigration because he
had no choice
the middle east doesn't look like it's
going to blow up especially anytime soon
he's getting out of afghanistan now he's
doing some really scary stuff
tax increases not a fan
like really not a fan um
the climate change stuff uh
you know i'm not sure he's
he's going the right way on that but uh
he's pro nuclear
as far as we know pro nuclear is good
everybody's happy about that who looks
into it anyway
all right tax increases equals stock
market down
oddly enough the day biden said he
wanted to
increase taxes on capital gains the
market dropped as it should
and then it went up to a new high the
very next day
yeah the markets weirdly the markets
don't seem to be
as tax obsessed as you think
they they seem profits obsessed
bella says you're old old people
selfishly don't care about climate
change
i do well bella let me tell you what's
different about
old people old people have seen more
scams than you have
and when you reach my age there are
things which you see in the news
that will make your hair catch on fire
at your age
that you will have seen dozens and
dozens and dozens of times
turned out not to be the problem you
thought it was
all right until you've been through that
cycle bella
probably you have to go through that
cycle 10 20 times
until you see the pattern the stuff you
see in the news is not real
and if you don't know that you're going
to be very very worried
all of your life the news is not
real it's it's a narrative it's a
it's the result of industry forces
economics personal interest bias
it's this weird mix now
bella here's why i believe you shouldn't
worry
i'm not telling you that climate change
is not real
and i'm not telling you that you
shouldn't that somebody shouldn't worry
about it
but humans are really really good at
this we are really good at getting
ourselves
so scared that we think we can't
possibly solve this problem and then we
solve it
you had the energy shortage where we
were going to run out of oil we didn't
for a 100 years we thought that humans
would run out of food
because the population would grow too
fast didn't happen
we thought japan was going to eat our
lunch economically because they were
growing so fast and whatever the 80s
didn't happen we thought that it was
going to when i was a kid
there was a certainty that there would
be nuclear war with
probably the soviet union didn't happen
i could go on but there's
so many of them yeah aids was going to
cross over
and wipe out heterosexuals as well
now it does pay to panic about these
things
it does pay because it's the panic that
makes you work hard enough to make sure
that they don't become a problem right
now sometimes things are pretty bad
i would say the pandemic was pretty darn
bad but
was the pandemic as bad as you thought
it would be
i don't know it depends how bad you
thought it would be
i'm going to tell you something that i
haven't said publicly before
all right early on in the pandemic
i got a phone call from somebody
many of you would perhaps recognize his
name
but um not everybody but somebody who
really really knows what they're talking
about
as in you would replace your own opinion
with this person's opinion
because they have so much credibility
and they're so smart
and that person told me that the
the virus was going to be a total
meltdown of society
and that we would have military rule
complete breakdown of order supply
chains broken
and basically just aft
no it was it was not naval and
um i've never been
more scared about the world
than that night let's just say i didn't
sleep well
yeah don't you can stop guessing who it
is you're not going to guess
but no it wasn't it wasn't cernovich but
that's a good guess
i'm just saying there was somebody who
understands the
let's say the math of pandemics so
somebody who's
you know way way more in the uh in the
the sweet spot of this and i've never
been more scared
about a news story period all right
now i've told you before i don't really
have physical fear of
really much of anything but
that was just chilling now i had a
alternate opinion my opinion was
i see somebody saying weinstein
that's a good guess in the sense that
that would be
a voice that would be as credible as
somebody who would understand the math
of it but it wasn't him
stop guessing you're not going to guess
it doesn't matter
so uh here's the point
i had a competing opinion which is that
we would figure a way out
and that we would we would figure out
how to do it
and we did so who was right
was my my friend who really knew what
he's talking about and scared the hell
out of me
i would say his his vision of where it
could have gone
didn't happen my version was that we
would not run out of food
and that it would not be martial law
we did not run out of food economy did
not collapse
that took a big hit didn't collapse
and here we are and i think we're on the
other side of it
and part of what i predicted is that we
would
we would do way better than people
imagined in
therapeutics and vaccines that was part
of my prediction
so you remember those of you watched me
since last year
you remember that i was more optimistic
about the pandemic than most people
and so far i would say that uh
at least that level of optimism um
was appropriate so bella if you're still
watching
um it is a crime what the news is doing
to you
because they're selling you on some
level of certainty
that never exists never has never will
we cannot predict things 20 years in the
future
nobody can and we will have developed so
much
technology and understanding and better
ways to do things in 20 years
that uh that you can't even imagine
right so when the news is trying to
scare you just remember there's an
agenda
the cnn said directly that they need
scary content and they're gonna try to
scare you with uh
with uh climate change they don't they
don't say it that way so i'm
i'm interpreting for them um
and here you are there there is a reason
that you're afraid but it's not because
of the facts
you're afraid because the way the facts
are presented to you
if i had to tell you what you should
worry about the most
climate change wouldn't even be in the
top 20.
and it's not because it isn't real it's
because we know how to do this stuff
we're really really good at it and if
you give us 20 years
us meaning you know humanity give us 20
years
we can fix almost anything if we're you
know dedicated to it
all right anymore questions yeah look at
just
nuclear energy you look at the uh
let's say that the mood about nuclear
energy
just from last five years is it might be
my imagination
but i'm pretty sure that the the
public's um
understanding of the risk of nuclear is
that the risk is
way less i mean way way less than people
imagined
way way less i mean it's minuscule it's
it's less risk than almost anything else
we can do
you know historically speaking and we
should get better in the future not
worse
uh but i think you know you could even
hear somebody like an
aoc say she's open to the argument
that's a big deal right aoc is basically
open to the argument on on nuclear
which i feel she probably means she
she's ready to be persuaded just isn't
making that an issue at the moment
all right got any other questions
thank you hollywood for nuclear fear
yeah that's
i'll bet that's true hollywood's a big
part of that
uh let's talk about bill gates idea to
spray
crap in the atmosphere to block the sun
is dangerous
well here's the thing
think about any technology that works
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna invent this big
metal thing that's gonna fly through the
air
and it'll be flying at hundreds of miles
per hour
but don't worry we'll figure out how
they can land safely
that didn't sound like a good idea did
it
would you be one of the first ones to
get in that airplane
i don't think so how about a nuclear
power plant
let's take this stuff that killed you
know
hundreds of thousands of people in japan
and make it into a power source
and put it in your backyard sounds like
a good idea doesn't it
well for the most part with the
exceptions of the poorly designed ones
like
chernobyl we've been fine
right it's actually been the safest
technology so
um there there are no examples of
you know these big intrusive uh
kinds of technologies that affect your
your your body
that didn't look like a bad idea at one
point
um so here's what an engineer would know
and i'm guessing if you're afraid of it
maybe you're not one
uh back me up engineers i know i have a
lot of engineers watching this
back me up that the way you would
approach this
and the idea is that you you put i
forget what the
what the material is but something you
would put in the air that would
block the sun just enough to compensate
if you were an engineer
how would you approach it
would you do everything all at once and
then just find out if it worked
or would you put a little bit up there
and see what happened
now my guess is that it's exactly the
kind of thing you could test small
and it probably dissipates after some
point whatever it is
so could you put some up there do a lot
of
human testing to make sure that people
weren't dying
keep this option in your back pocket and
don't use it unless
the hurricanes start destroying the
world
all right so here are the here are the
things which if your immediate thought
is the worst thing in the world here's
what you're missing
if you can't test it small in a way that
you really know
that that you could expand it safely if
you couldn't
successfully know on a small scale
test you wouldn't do a big big test
right so when you're saying to yourself
they want to block out the sun
what you should have said is they want
to run a small scale test and then we'll
know
if that's dangerous if it's not we might
run a small
slightly bigger test and sort of inch
into it
or we might do the test and then just
keep the option in our back
pocket knowing that we've not tested as
the best you could ever test but we've
tested
in case there's a global emergency and
everything's just falling apart
it's 30 years from now and we just need
to do something
as a last ditch effort
maybe right because even
let's take the vaccination if i said to
you
there's no risk at all of getting
the coronavirus but we'd like you to get
a vaccination would you do it
no no if i told you there's no risk of
you getting the
the coronavirus you're not going to take
the risk of the vaccination
as small as that is it's just extra risk
for nothing
so people don't take risks until the
until the risk reward is so
bad that the risk is worth it
so what is the risk of putting some junk
in the air and it blots out the sun and
destroys the earth
pretty big risk unless you've tested it
small
and then you've got a good idea what's
going to happen and unless
things are so bad that you're a little
desperate
right but if you imagine that it's
implemented in the worst
possible way then everything's a bad
idea
nothing annoys me more than somebody
will come up with an idea
and the critic will say well assume it's
implemented in the dumbest possible way
you know if it's a government program
maybe that's fair
but if it's elon musk i'll just pick a
name right or bill gates
do you think they're going to implement
it in the dumbest possible way
i don't think so somebody says that's
plain god
it's all playing god it doesn't matter
whether you're blocking the sun
or putting on sunscreen yeah
do you wear clothes it's
that's not a real argument
am i describing the coven response in a
sense
yeah the the coven um warp speed
vaccinations
is something you wouldn't do unless the
alternative was so horrible that it was
worth the risk
so that's exactly where we're at do i
ever persuade for pay
i can't think of a time i've done that
maybe i have
but not actively
all right other questions
um have i heard of that person
um probably not
you have almost zero risk
all right let me see i thought i saw a
good question going by there
um saying that oil is limited has been
the way oil companies have been scamming
us
no oil was limited but we developed
new technologies especially
you know fracking so oil was limited
that was real
um
am i getting asked to do speaking
engagements
well i have been asked to do some
virtual ones but i'm not
interested in those so i'm not i'm not
open for
speaking at the moment
fourth stimulus check i don't know i
don't have an opinion on that
uh now you're trying to guess what story
i said disappeared but it wasn't that
one
did i see bella back here
what's your economic view of
petrodollars i haven't really looked
into that
any clubhouse updates
i haven't been using clubhouse i've been
avoiding the
avoiding interviews thoughts on
tesla energy what is tesla energy just
the batteries you mean
i think that's the future yeah the
future will be
having your own battery at your house i
don't see any way that won't be the
future
plans for a new book well i'm thinking
about it thinking about a new book
will i go on gutfeld i'll get you know
if
if i get out of my media hibernation i
will
um i would enjoy that by the way if
you're not watching
the new gotfeld show that's on at 11
11 p.m weekdays on the east coast
8pm on the west coast it's the best
thing on at that time
literally it's the best thing on at that
time
what's this what would you ask donald
trump if you had the opportunity to talk
with him
well mustafa i did have the opportunity
to talk with him
i was invited to the oval office in 2018
and i actually got to chat with him i
can't tell you everything we talked
about
it wasn't like you know national secrets
but uh
i don't know if i asked oh i did ask him
a question yeah i did ask him a question
but i can't tell you what it was because
that would have been
a part of a private conversation
um do you like my
thinking about your tweets i don't know
if i've seen them
oh here's an interesting question
will larson says christianity as a
system what do you think about
confession
i'm a fan i'm a fan of anything that
religion has been doing long enough to
know that it works
and it does appear to me that this
process of
catholic confession it feels like
it feels like a useful thing it feels
like
that is a way to relieve some burden
so i think it's time tested
i'm very much in favor of religion
although i don't have one i'm not i'm
not a believer
but objectively speaking it's just
obviously good for a lot of people in a
lot of different ways
gives them structure gives them
something to live for
[Music]
it's you know 90 percent good and then
10
you know nothing's perfect do you still
ride your motorized bike you mean my
e-bike
um i i do
just i'm waiting for the weather to get
a little bit better
your thoughts on freud well i think
freud has been debunked right as
there i don't think there are any modern
people modern
psychologists who believe that freud was
anything but a
fraud i don't think anybody believes him
still
frank tv is frank tv the
lindell tv uh i've only seen that word
in the news and i didn't know what it
referred to
but i think it's mike lindell's right
oh somebody bought two of them and you
love them nobody doesn't like them
i'll bet there's no such thing as anyone
who's ever bought
an e-bike you know electronic assist
bike
i'll bet no one's ever bought one who
regretted it
it is just one of the coolest products
of all time you really
you can't really just look at somebody
writing one
and understand you have to be on it like
otherwise you just don't get it and then
you get it immediately
yeah it's a totally different experience
it's not like
it's not really a bicycle it's not a
motorcycle
it makes you feel like you have
superpowers so it's it's cool
uh what do you think of dreams you know
that's
that's an interesting question because
one of my hypotheses is
isn't it weird that we dream
it doesn't make sense does it it doesn't
feel like dreaming
should be necessary it feels like we
would have evolved out of it or
something
but uh here's my simulation theory
that if we are a game in other words if
this thing we think is our reality is
actually a video game
and that some of us maybe not all of us
have a human player
or some alien or something who is
basically
inhabiting us for the purpose of the
game
sometimes they take time off in their
world
what if when you're dreaming
that's the time that your real world
operator of you as an avatar
is simply doing something else and
they're not playing the game
and when they're not playing the game
you just go unconscious
and and random you know firings of your
brain
so it could be that the only time you're
awake is when your
you know your character player is
inhabiting you
or or you just need sleep
alright you just lost the game
yeah if you die i think you lose the
game
so why do dogs dream do they
well a good question that would be a
flaw in the
plan wouldn't it unless people unless
dogs are inhabited by players
i guess you couldn't rule that out do
you believe in manifesting
talents don't know what you mean in that
context
i believe in collecting talents that
stack up well
um there's abide in a crypto attack
i don't know what you're talking about
is biden trying to limit cryptocurrency
somehow
have i tried dmt no i don't think i need
it
um let me explain
when you when you talk to somebody who's
tried dmt
they'll tell you how it changed their
world view but it usually changes it to
what my world view already is so uh
while i'm sure i would enjoy the
experience
i don't know that uh i don't know that i
need to change my
world view to what it already is
read the book why we sleep yeah i
realize there's a
you know biological necessity
um
oh what what is the result if we
eliminate
the narratives what what's that question
what end result do dems and the msm
want after eliminating conservatives
well the power
you know everybody wants power and
ratings and all the usual stuff
power money ratings influence
oh the sec is going after crypto well
that's no surprise they have to
i don't know that you can have a country
if it doesn't have
control of its currency maybe you can
i'm saying asteroid is greater than the
earth somebody keeps
writing here is there an asteroid
heading for the earth i'm not aware of
that
uh taiwan taiwan trying to get nuclear
weapons i'm surprised they haven't
maybe they have them do we know for sure
that taiwan
doesn't have nuclear capability what do
we know
i don't know that seems like exactly the
kind of place you'd want to put it
yeah biden's capital gains tax increase
to 40
i i like to think that the republicans
are never going to let that happen it
might be just a big first
big first offer did i watch the launch i
did not
will china invade taiwan i don't know if
they need to
that's the bad part i i think that china
can just keep surrounding taiwan and
putting pressure on in a thousand
different ways until
some opportunity comes up where they can
make their move i don't know that
they'll do it militarily
or that they'll need to but i would say
it's inevitable i don't i don't think
there's any
i don't see any future in which taiwan
remains independent
if you look 100 years in the future
um governor jenner
yeah i guess caitlyn jenner is
thinking about running for governor uh
that would be interesting
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
thanks for joining me
