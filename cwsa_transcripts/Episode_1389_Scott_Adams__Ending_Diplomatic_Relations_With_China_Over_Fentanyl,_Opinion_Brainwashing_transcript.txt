hey everybody come on in it's time for
the best part of your day
it's called coffee with scott adams and
it features something called
have you heard of it it's the
simultaneous sip yeah
it's all over the world it's catching on
like fire
and all you need is a copper bunker
glass of tanker gels to stein a canteen
joke or flash
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous hip and it's going to
happen right now
go
yes sean connolly i agree with your
statement
so let's talk about all the things
just before i came on i saw a series of
tweets by christopher
ruffo rufo and i just retweeted them so
you can see them at the top of my feed
or the top of
his feed and apparently he's learned
that lockheed martin the nation's
largest defense contractor
send key executives to a three-day white
male re-education camp
um what
what they didn't really send their
white men to a white male re-education
camp
did they to deconstruct their quote
white male culture
and atone for their quote white male
privilege
well christopher has obtained the
internal documents
which appear to suggest that's exactly
what's happening
um and let me read some of this
uh so here here are some of the
traits key white male culture
characteristics
so this comes from the training program
it says studying the relationship
between white male culture and the
history of the british isles can help
american white men
see which traits traits that ensure
their ancestors survival
live on in them today now presumably
they wouldn't be talking about these
traits unless they were
racist right or somehow
a negative thing but here are these uh
key white male cultural characteristics
according to this training program
survivor mentality that focuses on the
future
okay a tendency to rugged individualism
okay a can-do attitude
all right operating from principles and
conscience
focus on hard work action and task
completion
striving towards success and materialism
measured moderation and silent strength
focus on status and rank over
connection okay
and apparently these are devastating
things for
other cultures and so
white men need to be either advised of
these advantages so they can correct or
change them i don't know what
but if you if you're waiting for
when have things gone too far
here we are here we are
things have gone a little too far
so i think there's going to be some
major
pushback to some of these companies
let's talk about china i think it's time
to end
american diplomatic relations with china
now that doesn't mean we can't still
send the messages
and deal with them but i think we should
end full diplomatic
uh status until they stop sending
fentanyl over here because remember they
promised they would do that
trump got a promise to do that and they
did none of it
the the opening offer simply to
have a diplomatic um presence
has to be stop attacking us does anybody
have
a diplomatic relationship with somebody
who is
actively attacking their country with
fentanyl
50 90 000 people something like that
dead every year from chinese fentanyl
so i've told you a number of times
that uh the government there are some
things the government just can't do for
you
because they're they've got special
interests they've got to get reelected
etc
there's some things that the public just
has to do
and the first thing the public needs to
do is get our
politicians to end diplomatic relations
with china
subject to them stopping the fentanyl
flow which they could do
like that so keep in mind it's just a
decision
if china wanted to turn it off we've
even given them the name of the dealer
they know where he lives they know his
name we gave them evidence
they could just pick them up but that
won't happen
because they don't want it to stop
obviously so we should just
get rid of our diplomatic relations so
i'm going to start
pushing that lever as hard as i can
it seems unlikely that i would succeed
but
it needs to be part of the conversation
we should at least
be talking about dropping diplomatic
relationship
it should at the very least be a
conversation
right if we decide not to well let's
look at that decision
but we should be talking about it the
fact that we're not
talking about it is a giant red flag
that your government is incompetent
completely incompetent now there might
be a few people who would talk about it
you might have your tom cotton's i don't
know if you'd be willing to go that far
but we certainly need to put that offer
on the table
it's like this is sorry the the
opening bid to even have relationship
with the united states is
stop your chemical warfare that's not
unreasonable
it's not even a little bit unreasonable
it's not even
a pico bit unreasonable it's completely
within the
fair reasonable historically
compatible everything there's nothing
wrong with
cutting off or at least threatening to
cut off diplomatic relations
and again we can still talk with them
it's not like we would immediately go to
a nuclear war if that happened
speaking of that i told you that if we
could find out what the problem was
in getting products in this country
labeled as to their country of origin
uh that i would persuade to maybe change
that
so my understanding is since yesterday
that there is a bipartisan bill meaning
that you got
your democrats and you got your
republicans who were in favor of better
labeling
because remember biden is by america
trump is by america right so both sides
want this why won't it happen well it
turns out that big retailers
and amazon being at the top of the list
don't want it to happen
now part of it is that it would be a a
big burden on them
and i think you could probably find a
way to to make that burden either
phased in or or less of a burden
but their argument is that it would be a
burden
and i think it would be a burden but it
might be a burden that's
worth having because the fate of the
whole country
depends on them taking that burden and i
think
it's not that big a burden if the entire
you know
fate of the country is involved take a
little burden
don't mind the don't mind if you do but
here's the thing what would it take for
congress to get the
to get the balls even though it's
bipartisan
what would it take for them to actually
pass this thing knowing that they might
get resistance from the big retailers
well
let me throw out a suggestion and maybe
you can tell me if it's
legal so this is not a suggestion
it's a question would it be legal to do
the following
uh get a list put congress on notice
that we're going to
track who votes for it and who votes
against it
and all those who vote against the idea
of labeling products so we know what
comes from china
those who vote against it could we
and it's just a question start some kind
of a gofundme
pack that just gives all of the money
raised however much it is
to the opposition of anybody who votes
against it
or alternately you would get you would
fund the campaigns of the ones who
voted for it so you could go either way
but
don't you think that the public needs to
take control of this decision
if congress can't get it passed on their
own so if congress can't get this passed
we need
some kind of gigantic funding entity
you know it could be 10 bucks a piece
you know we just all chip in
and it gets to be a pretty big number
pretty quickly
um and if you made it a a pack
could you donate all that money legally
just
distribute it evenly to all the people
who voted
for it or distribute equally to all the
opponents and
primary challengers for anybody who
voted against it
and just put them on record and we and
the first thing we need to start with
is to find out who voted for and against
it
and to let them know before they vote
that that it's going to put a big
financial pressure on them
in their next election so it's just a
question
could such a thing be done legally to
have some kind of a fund that we could
all pay into
to get the government to do what we want
them to do because
it seems to me that uh big companies
retailers amazon etc
would have enough lobbying muscle
that they could get enough politicians
to say no to this
so the only way this is going to happen
is if the public is bigger than
these other forces so
that's that's the question so if anybody
has some good ideas how this could
happen but we need a list of anybody who
votes against this
and we need to take them out because
this is
this isn't really regular politics how
we deal with china
is not just an economic question it's a
big economic question
but it's not really about the economics
it's about
the long-term viability of the country
it's about being able to compete in the
future with our our biggest
uh threat so i don't think that this
situation is like a regular political
situation
and if our politicians simply are
too constipated or cowardly to
get this done the public has to make
them do it
so remember we we've passed
we're beyond the phase where the
politicians are in charge
they're not anymore the politicians are
not in charge
they're only in charge of the stuff we
don't care about
right so if they want to you know pass a
bill that says the new national
bird or something yeah they can do that
um why did i tweet out a fake
matt gates story they used a quote from
a different part of the speech
says abe let's talk about that by the
way
tweet me a correction to that if uh if
you have a correction to that
so um
that's what we're going to do with china
there's a story about the
black lives matter co-founder who
stepped down from the organization it's
patrice colors and of course she got a
little uh
heat because
because she bought some real estate now
of course
the fake news is reporting that she
bought
3.2 million dollars worth of real estate
now when you hear that do you say to
yourself
well she just spent 3.2 million dollars
i guess she's doing pretty well
that's not really what happened she owns
real estate worth that much but we don't
know how much is loans
we don't know if somebody some of it
might be rentals
that she's paying against the loans so
we don't know how much money is actually
involved but
it looks significant and she says she's
going to quit to focus on her book and
film deals
because black lives matter is working
just great so she can step away now
now is it too soon to call her a white
supremacist
is that is that too soon because my
understanding is
that if you act this way you're sort of
a white supremacist
meaning that she's it looks like she's
just joining the higher
the she's joining the power group
she's just becoming a person who's got
money
and in charge and has a good situation
i feel like she became a white
supremacist is that too far
am i taking that too far because i don't
think i am
actually i don't think that's hyperbole
if you were to just accept their
description of life
and just apply it to their own situation
i feel like that's fair
that because the white supremacy thing
isn't so much about an individual
it's about a situation and she just
became part of the situation
so i think she just joined the white
supremacists
by their definition not mine
so that's interesting um
did you see a video i tweeted it around
this morning
in before the 2018 midterms
that both the senator then senator
harris
and senator klobuchar were both on video
talking about
how the voting machines could easily be
hacked
in 2018. that's right
kamala harris and amy klobuchar on video
in in a very clear statements saying hey
we got trouble here because he's been a
video not a video
these election machines can easily be
hacked
what does that do to your head what
does your brain just blow up because
as funny as it is to watch cnn and msnbc
gaslight the country and they are just
gaslighting you by the way
it you know i used i used to not use
that term
because i used to define it the
traditional way which is somebody trying
to make you crazy
they're not trying to make you crazy
they're just trying to sell you a
different
different reality but i guess people are
calling that gaslighting now so
i will i will adopt the common usage
so you think you're just getting
gaslighted by the media until you see
that the democrats themselves
are exactly the same opinion that
anything can get hacked
because anything can get hacked
there's no exceptions this whole it's
not connected to the internet and stuff
that's just garbage because you could
connect it
you could put a flash drive in there it
could have been connected before
you could have an insider it just
doesn't mean anything that is not
connected to the internet
all right
there's big news from joe biden i don't
know if you saw it
but uh he got ice cream yesterday
he got ice cream wait that's not the
whole news
that would be that would be kind of weak
right if the whole news is
joe biden went to get ice cream that
wouldn't be much of a story but luckily
it's deeper than that we know the flavor
and it's a chocolate chocolate chip or
chocolate crunch or something
yeah it's chocolate chocolate chip so um
not only did he get ice cream but we
know the flavor
and um it's a pretty good example of the
press coming down hard on him i think
now if president trump
had gotten ice cream and let's say he
had ordered vanilla
what would people say about him
if president trump had ordered vanilla
ice cream
that's right racist racist only the
white supremacists get
vanilla ice cream but not joe biden he
got the extra extra chocolate and i
think he's on brand
there so doing a good job
and i like that they show us that he's
not
completely institutionalized yet he can
actually walk outside and eat an ice
cream and
tell people what flavor he got so if you
thought that he was incompetent
well look again could he be incompetent
and still eat an ice cream cone in
public
i don't know how i mean that's pretty
pretty good evidence that he's
on the ball he can even get ice cream
well dyden's talking also about taxing
the top one percent
and i would like to say once again
i think you need to make a distinction
in the top one percent i think that
people
over 50 or you could pick pick a number
but but people who spent their whole
life trying to
build up you know a certain situation
and then you change the rules just
before they retire
i don't feel that's quite fair
especially the capital gains tax part of
it
before people retire now i wouldn't be
so upset if it got phased in you know it
hits the young first and
there's less of it there's less of it as
we go
but at the moment the democrats are
doing what they always do which is
penalizing success and penalizing hard
work
and completely ignoring the effect of
human motivation
there is a tax rate upon which i will
quit working
like literally just i'll just retire
now i have enough money that i don't
have to work but i
am incentivized by money even though i
have
i have money and i don't know why i mean
it's just like a dog with a treat you
know if the dog's not hungry they'll
still take a treat
they'll still do a trick for a treat and
yeah i'm a little bit like that and but
if my tax rate goes to oh god 100
which it looks like it's going to you
know 60
or something would be my effective tax
rate closer to 70
probably if you counted all my taxes um
i just don't think it would be worth
working for 30 cents on a dollar you
know
at my age and given that i don't need
the money that much
so i think i would just quit and i
produce
i don't know how many millions of
dollars of you know
activity if you count the ripple effect
of you know
i make a book somebody buys a book etc
so there's a ripple effect
but i would take just me just one person
i would probably take 10 to 20 million
dollars out of the economy the day he
changed
the tax rate if he got the ripple effect
so don't do that um
here's a something that's been bugging
me all day
and it goes like this if you're bad at
persuading
and you have an opinion and you express
your opinion in public but you're not
really good at persuading
people what would people call that
they would just call it your opinion
right here's my opinion
it's not expressed very persuasively
most opinions are not
so that's just my opinion but what would
happen if somebody had an opinion
and they were really well trained at
persuasion
so when they gave you your opinion it
was necessarily
really packaged well to change your mind
what is it then is it still just an
opinion
if it's expressed in a persuasive
weaponized form that
will actually change your decisions and
maybe even change your actions in life i
would argue that that's not an opinion
anymore
i would argue that that's brainwashing
right
manipulation brainwashing right so
why is it that an untrained unskilled
person can just have an opinion
but somebody else who might even have
the same opinion but is trained and
skilled
is now a brainwasher
because it really asks some questions
about free will
and i've been watching uh this second
documentary there's a new documentary
about the
nexium uh alleged cult
and i've been watching it it's on stars
it is called
what's it called uh
well you can find it just look it up
it's the it's not the vow
it's the new one but i've been watching
that trying to learn all the
you know whatever persuasion tricks were
used in this and i'm picking up a lot of
a lot of good stuff
and this one really really
uh asks the question
because if you listen to the story of
you know one of the people who's the the
main
the main focus of the documentary
the woman says in her own in her own
voice
she says that she made all the decisions
on her own
but she also believes that she was sort
of brainwashed and manipulated into them
but the only part that wasn't
fully disclosed seemed a little bit
trivial to her complaint
for example when they got branded
they didn't know that it was keith
renery's initials they were told it was
some other thing now that didn't change
your decision about getting branded
i mean maybe she would have not done it
if it were initials but maybe she would
have i don't know
it was just something she didn't know
she did decide to get branded
she knew exactly what it was a trained
physician did the branding because it
was the physician
who was part of the organization and
a lot of different women did it and it
was done in phases
so you know women could see the other
other women had done it
before they did it so they had lots of
information about it they could
look at other people's etc so
but there was also a point where they
had to give some uh
so-called collateral which they would
they were worried would be used for
blackmail now there's no evidence any of
it was ever used for blackmail
but but they were afraid it would be
used
so that's coercive right but
they also were told exactly why
they were they were told that they
wanted to
that they were being asked to give black
male information
so they would be obedient and they
agreed
they agreed to it so at what point
does the person who's agreeing to all
this
have full responsibility and at what
point do they not have responsibility
because the person they were working
with was a
brainwashing manipulator
it's sort of a weird gray area isn't it
a little gray area
now there are other charges against
keith rooney that involved
underage girls and
some other stuff and i don't have an
opinion about that stuff
if if any of that's true that's between
the legal system
and roneri so i wasn't there so i don't
know what did or didn't happen
but you really have to ask yourself
whether uh
the cult so to speak has any
responsibility for making their own
decisions
you know do you do you believe in free
will
if you do it feels like the people who
are there
it's kind of their on them but if you
don't
then they were led into this situation
by this
super good persuasion now how many of
you know
what was the persuasion purpose of the
brands
i want to see if you know if you can
figure this out if you've watched me for
a while
maybe you read win bigly tell me what
was the
persuasion purpose of the branding
and i'm going to look in the comments
and see if anybody knows
what that was pacing and leading no
it's not pacing leading consistency
you're close you're close uh
taking action no turning back skin in
the game
a little bit a little bit commitment
some cost belonging i'm looking at all
your ideas
ownership memory mnemonics skin in the
game group action
well so there definitely was some
some influence because the other people
were doing it that was part of it but
that's just what got them to do it
what was the point of the brand
family it's a big ask thinking past the
sale
wow you know none of you got it
none of you got it i don't think
but maybe i missed a comment reciprocity
now
identification recognition marketing
conformity belonging i'm looking at your
exclusivity obedience
all right let me just tell you cognitive
dissonance
all right that's the play getting the
brand
would in every case trigger cognitive
distance
and cognitive dissonance works this way
hey nobody in their right mind would get
a brand
right even the people who got the brand
would be completely aware that nobody in
their right mind
gets branded i mean not this kind of
brand i
i know it's done by some people who do
it you know voluntarily as part of a
body modification but nobody would get
this
brand if it made any sense
and they were thinking right but they
did
so if you can get somebody to do
something that even the person knows is
absurd
what happens cognitive dissonance
that's that's the trigger the trigger is
to get somebody to do something
that they know to be irrational if you
can guess somebody to
do something that they know is
irrational their brain has to
rationalize it
there are two ways that their brain will
rationalize it number one
man i am really loyal to my leader i am
so committed to this thing
this thing is great this organization
i'm in
is so great that i i would get a brand
for it that's how great it is
is it just a confidence scheme maple bob
x
um i wouldn't say it's a confidence
scheme i just wouldn't use those words
but i know what you're getting at
no cognitive dissonance is the play you
get somebody
to do something that's so wildly
irrational that they have to explain to
themselves why they did it and then they
reprogrammed themselves
to say it must have made sense because
i'm so committed to this group
but here's the problem
there's no persuasion that works with
everybody the same way
there there's lots of persuasion that is
very consistent
and you could expect most people to be
influenced in just the same way
and the the other thing that could
happen is
some number of these people will
rationalize that they were blackmail i'm
not blackmailed
they'll rationalize that they were
brainwashed
right so if you get the brand and you
know it's crazy and irrational
you have to rationalize it most of them
probably said oh i'm extra loyal
this is such a important organization
that i'm committed for life
blah blah and probably that happened to
most of them
but you can predict that there were like
150 people i think in the group
and of 150 you could predict with
certainty that at least one of them
is going to say wait a minute the reason
i did it is that i was brainwashed
now that one was the one that there was
an effort to rescue her
and deprogrammer now let's say your
normal people get a hold of you
you know the people from the outside
that you've been cut off from so the
normal people get a hold of you
they say it's crazy it's crazy it's
crazy and all the normal people say the
same thing
it's crazy what you did doesn't make any
sense it's crazy
you would expect that person to now
reinterpret their experience as i must
have been brainwashed
because yeah you're right all of my
friends all my family
are saying the same thing they're right
i would never make this decision in my
right mind
if i thought about it if i knew the
whole situation i never would have done
this
which is probably true by the way they
probably wouldn't have
but uh
here finn we'll take care of you
uh we found a uh narcissist here
finn chopes and we're gonna remove him
the narcissists you can always identify
because they go after the
the person or the personality or the the
way you said it
everybody who does that i now recognize
it took a while to to figure out that
there's a specific
personality characteristics that's
really predictable
so those are people who want you to
think that they're better than me
so they're going on here just to tell
you that they're better than me that's
all
that's all that's all you needed to know
no specific
problem i'm just better than this guy so
those are yeah those are your peacocks
bye bye peacock
so that's uh nexium
so um so one of the uh super chat
comments is that there was some fake
news on the matt gates
quote um and the
i saw the video so i'll be interested
maybe you can tell me what's the fake
news
so be alerted that we have at least one
report
that the news i'm going to read to you
is not real all right so you've been
warned
might not be real i did see matt gates
say it in his own voice
but how many times have we been rhubarb
the fact that you saw it on video and
you watched it with your own eyes and
you heard it with your own ears
it doesn't mean it happened it could be
that what was cut off
before that or after that there may be
some context missing
somebody says uh but it is fake can you
tell me how
it was faked was it faked with an edit
uh i tweeted replied it to you well
let's see
because probably there's like a
different uh
let's get to the bottom of this right
now
because it certainly looked like fake
news it was a little too on the nose
but i had a theory about why it would be
that so
let's see if i can find those comments
oh there's like a zillion comments here
though
um let's see
i don't see anybody doubting this
all right well you've been you've been
warned that uh there's a
counterpoint to this um
yeah all right so i don't know what the
truth is there
some people say it's fake news but if it
were not fake news
this is what i would say what is it that
made uh
president trump when he was running for
the first
election what made him
so interesting what
what was it that sucked all of the
energy and of the air everywhere else
um the way that trump did it was to be
outrageous and to say things that you
knew couldn't be right
or that you knew were too far or that
you just couldn't believe he said it
but it was still compatible with the
base
how many people who are pro-second
amendment and
by the way i'm seeing lots of people
saying it's fake news so just you can
assume it's fake news until we
until we sort it out but with this many
people saying it's fake news i'm
you're probably right but let me make
the point
more generally without knowing whether
this is real or not
the general point is that matt gates
would be smart enough
to know that staying offensive all the
way through a primary would be how he'd
win
because you could imagine
that he would say something like the
second amendment blah blah blah
the news would want to talk about it all
the time
but the base would say yeah maybe the
second amendment
right so a lot of people in the base
would sort of
silently agree with him and that's what
trump had going for him
a lot of people would sort of silently
agree with trump but they wouldn't go
that far themselves
and it just you can't look away because
it's so provocative
so matt gates has that skill he has the
skill
to make himself interesting all the time
and that's a really predictive skill for
getting pretty far
in a presidential race
all right um can somebody
tell me in the comments why it's fake
news
is it because there was something that
was clipped
it's not a fake edit the one i saw is it
all right so maybe somebody can tell me
why they think that's fake news at the
moment i don't have any evidence
one way or another uh
somebody says it was edited well i'm
gonna have to see that
maybe somebody has a
couple of videos back to back so it was
edited
all right all right all right i'll go
take a look at that and we'll let's just
assume that
this is not likely to be real news and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
