boom
hey hey everybody hey jack
good to see you come on in come on in
it's an incredible day one of the best
really and today on coffee with scott
adams we're going to have a good time
even if you're listening to this at 1.5
times speed
well you'll just get to get goodness a
little bit faster that way won't you
but you only got to get that in replay
i'm afraid i can't talk that fast in
real time
but before we begin what would make this
extra special i think you know
it's a simultaneous sip and all you need
is a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chalices dying a canteen sugar class
a vessel of any kind
like oh this is a problem i can't reach
my coffee cup
because my microphone isn't long enough
this is a problem
are you gonna have to come with me
youtube
stay where you are periscope come with
me
come with me
[Music]
oh oh yeah there we go
that's the good stuff join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
ah oh i can't put my cup back all right
i'm gonna have to fix this
hold on hold on there we go
all better all right let's talk about
all the things
first of all happy valentine's day
velen's villains titans day
my denture is working i don't have
dentures
just kidding happy valentine why can't i
say that word
valentine's day happy valentine's day
special shout out to my incredible wife
christina happy valentine's day to you
if you're watching
and i hope you're up early so you can um
so the us is reporting the lowest number
of weekly covet cases since october
all right all right is the vaccine
working
maybe because i would think we would
have
the highest infections now right right
in the middle of february
wouldn't february be one of your bad uh
your bad virus months or automatically
well um
let's let's keep that going so that's
some good news
you know you've been hearing about this
uh allegation that the
covent virus coronavirus came from uh
a lab in we we do not have proof of that
that is an allegation but one of the
things you're hearing about
is whether or not the so-called gain of
function
could could be detected in other words
if somebody had
tried to take regular natural viruses
and if someone let's say a major
military power with a
biological lab if they tried to
weaponize that by
tweaking it to make it extra deadly or
to have some special
gain of function to make it more of a
weapon
would we be able to spot that by looking
at the virus
in other words could you look at the
virus and say well look yeah there's a
little man-made thing in there that
virus
and when this first when the pandemic
first came out and people were
i heard experts say on television the
expert said
no you know we looked at it and you
could tell
i mean you could tell if it were
modified and it's just a regular virus
blah blah blah to which i said to myself
can you can you tell
because it seemed to me that there would
be at least two ways
that you could modify a virus and this
is without knowing anything
right my complete zero uh
knowledge of science is going to be
fully applied here
one way it seems to me would be directly
if you could literally
directly somehow add a add a thing or
subtract a thing from a virus
i don't can we do that is there some lab
that can add or subtract
something from a virus is that even a
thing
i don't know if you could i suppose if
that existed
maybe you could detect it you'd say ah
that can't happen naturally
that must have been some human did that
but the second way that you can create
gain of function somebody says a crispr
can
so you can change the dna in a virus
is it dna i don't mean what a virus
isn't even alive right
the virus is technically not alive
so i don't know exactly what kind of
stuff is inside a virus
we're well beyond my scientific
knowledge somebody says genes
i don't know if that's right either so
let me not try to guess
on the science we'll just i'm going to
make my major point
which is there must be at least two ways
you can modify them
one would be directly if we could do
that
but the other way would be to just breed
it naturally
how can you breed a virus well
apparently the way you do it is you put
one animal who has the virus let's say a
penguin or whatever pangolin or whatever
those things are
you put it somewhere where it can infect
another animal
let's say a different kind of mammal or
a bird
or a pig and then maybe the pig
infects yet another animal so
i need a fact check on this but my
understanding is
that if you create these artificial
infection scenarios
where the virus will jump from and this
is the key
one species to another that during the
jump
from species the virus changes
some of those changes will be nothing
some will make it less deadly
some might make it more deadly so you
could experiment
just by reinfecting different types of
animals
until you ended up with a virus that had
some extra good stuff just by accident
that you want it and that would be a
gain of function now let me ask you this
if scientists looked at a virus they had
gone through
hypothetically the transition from
multiple species to give it a gain of
function
could you identify that i mean really
do we have any science that could
identify
that a human put these animals together
as opposed to there was something in the
wild in which they just got infected
i don't think so somebody says
probabilistic
probabilistically maybe
maybe um but i don't think you could be
sure
right so i'll just put that out there
and by the way the first person
i asked this question to privately
just without you know something i didn't
do on twitter or didn't do publicly
but just privately i asked the smartest
person i knew
in this kind of area could you put a
gain of function on there that nobody
could detect
what did the smartest people say yeah
obviously you could
of course you could yeah now i don't
know if they're right
but i'm telling you the smartest people
i know say yeah obviously you could do
that
so maybe maybe not
the daily mail is reporting today
something that i just had to keep
reading and rereading to see if it
i didn't even think i was really reading
it all right
so tell me if you've heard this so the
daily mail is reporting this like it's
just a fact
is this a fact here's what they report
the pentagon admits admits being the key
word here
pentagon admits that it has been testing
wreckage from ufo crashes
including a possible quote memory medal
that experts claim may have been
recovered during the 1947
rosh roswell crash
what they're reporting this like it's a
fact
now they're not quite saying that it's
an alien spaceship
piece of metal they're not quite saying
that
but they are saying we found some metal
that doesn't
appear to come from human beings
and they're calling this they're
reporting it like it's a fact
somebody says yes it's called uh nitinol
now is this story real
right so when they say ufos they just
mean unidentified
so it could have been an unidentified
let's say russian technology that we
don't
recognize so it's just unidentified they
don't say
it's from outer space but they do kind
of say it's a metal we don't make here
on earth
and it wasn't something that came off an
asteroid it was something that somebody
made
and it doesn't look like he came from
earth
what do you think what do you think
about this story
i am going to call on this
story
uh i do not believe that there are uh
that there is life on other planets
because i think we're a simulation and
it was just never built out
because we didn't need it so there's
just no reason for life to be on other
planets because we're a simulation
and if we can't get to those other
planets easily well we just didn't need
to put anything there
so uh i don't believe it
but it's a fun story it's a fun story
and so therefore i like it
because it's fun so here's my uh
take on the illegitimate press
that we have in this country you're
seeing a lot of the anti-trumpers
use a phrase called the big lie
so they're using this this label
the big lie to talk about trump's claim
that the election had been fraudulent
now you may be a familiar that the
phrase big lie
comes from nazi propaganda and the idea
is
that the nazis said if you tell a small
lie
you know such as somebody who stole some
loaf of bread or something
people are inclined you know maybe
believe it maybe not
but if you tell a lie that's so big
if it's big enough people will believe
it because they will say to themselves
well nobody could
tell a lie that big you know like if you
heard tomorrow that
an actual alien spaceship landed in the
middle of the capital
and all of the news reported it was true
that's so big that's probably true
right your your brain just says that
can't be not true
how could that be not true everybody is
reporting it
how could that not be true right so if
the lie is big enough it makes it look
more credible and that is literally a
nazi propaganda trick
that's where we get the phrase the big
lie
now when your press in the united states
refers to trump and by by extension his
followers
as spreading the quote big lie
what is that doing to public discourse
well
number one it conflates trump supporters
by association with trump and many of
them agreed with him on this point
it equates them to nazis
that's what it does the the reason they
choose that is to equate
trump and his followers with nazis
 you let me say this to any press
person who uses the phrase the big lie
and tries to paint trump supporters as
nazis
just in this clever little way it's
racist
it's racist i regard that like the n
word
but used against me right to me that is
as offensive
that's as offensive as the n-word is to
anybody else
now can i compare offensiveness no i
mean it's subjective
but it's a 10. you know i would say that
if you said to
any black american how bad is the use of
the n-word
if it's you know if you're not black
when you're using it how bad
is that i think they say that's a 10 and
a 10.
i would agree that's a 10 out of 10. my
personal opinion
you can't get any worse than using the n
word
you know if you're not black likewise
this is a 10 and a 10. when
you're using
literally nazi imagery to paint your
enemies
just because they weren't sure that the
election had
transparency that's racism
that's a 10 and a 10. and if you
if you use it as i just read in the
washington post
somebody using that that phrase you're a
 racist
you're a racist live with it
you racist now you might be a
white person
being racist against other white people
but it's still the same thing
you're a racist right and
i believe that my anger about that
phrase
is going to keep increasing until
people understand this is unacceptable
behavior
now there is a second problem with using
this big lie
do you know what it is from a persuasion
propaganda perspective
anybody anybody tell me what is the
propaganda brainwashing quality
of using the phrase the big lie
in the comments you're going to have it
in a moment
it's making you think past the sale when
they say it's the big lie
they they try to make you uncritically
accept that it's a lie
we haven't determined that it has not
been determined that it's a lie
it is simply something that the people
who don't believe it
think is probably not true it's not the
big lie
it's the big probably not true
according to you that's what it is
it's probably not true according to you
if you're
people using the big life race it's not
a lie that would indicate that we know
it's not
true we simply know it hasn't been
proven
that there is any widespread fraud in
the court of law
that's what we know we don't know it's a
big
 lie and when you tell us it's a
big lie
that's a big lie that's the big
lie
now remember i keep telling you i hate
it i
hate it when tucker carlson keeps being
right about this
he just keeps being right that whatever
they're doing
whatever they're doing themselves
they'll accuse you of
and i swear to god i don't want that to
be true because i just
don't know why it's true like i can't
figure out why
why is this key being true but this is
exactly what they're doing with this big
lie thing
the big lie is to make it look like the
thing they're doing
they're doing which is lying about the
credibility of the election
we don't know it was honest we don't
know that it wasn't honest
we simply don't know and
nobody's fixing it nobody's
 fixing it there is no effort by
anybody that i'm aware of fact-check me
on this
to fix the system because it's
going to be just as
non-transparent next time
so here again the illegitimate press
is using uh is accusing the right of
their own crime
spreading the big lie
somebody asked me if this phrase the big
lie
is so good persuasively that maybe it
came from
childini you know robert gildini
now if you know my history i've talked
about him as possibly being
or probably being a an advisor to the
clinton campaign there's no indication
that he
was involved with the biden campaign i
don't know one way or the other
but somebody asked me do you think he
was behind
this phrase the big lie
i'm going to give you just an opinion no
and here's why i don't think he was
behind
the big lie because it's a racist
 brainwashing piece of thing
to do
and i have no reason to believe that
robert cialdini is a piece of
no indication of that in fact i believe
he's actually taught
courses on ethically using persuasion
he would be exactly the opposite of
somebody who would give you advice
to compare people to nazis
he didn't do that now i suppose
anything's possible right i could be
wrong
i'm only just speculating but it's kind
of crazy to imagine that a
normal person would do this
this isn't what normal people who are
good people do
and as far as i know chelted is a normal
good person
right this is evil right
i don't i have no reason to think he's
 evil i think he just likes
democrats more than republicans
fine right no
no problem with that all right different
topic uh jonathan hate
uh h-a-i-d-t if i'm height
fight i hate it how do you pronounce his
last name
um a well-known author
he tweeted around a study that says that
kids who get help
from adults to solve a puzzle
become helpless on the next puzzle
and you can see it in real time it
happens instantly
so if you if you have a puzzle and kids
are trying to solve it
you have half of the kids just work as
long as they can with any help
and then another half you have a parent
jump in and say ah here's the here's the
solution
and solve it for then you wait a little
bit
and you give those same two groups of
people a new challenge
a new puzzle the ones who had no help
charge right through and do the same
thing they did on the first one
they try as hard as they can to solve it
and succeed to some extent
the ones who got help can't solve the
second one because they can't try hard
enough
they've been ruined actually broken
by get by giving them too much help now
i have often said this about my own
parenting uh experience
my parents were maybe typical of the
time i'm not sure but they were
fairly hands off i would say
i don't know if my siblings are watching
this but uh i would look for
a second opinion on this my
my belief or memory or
you know of my childhood is that we had
almost unprecedented ability to make our
own decisions about
stuff and to and to manage our own day
i don't believe listen to this and then
compare this
to 2021. if you have kids in school
right now
just just hear this story and just try
to imagine this
today my parents
didn't really show an interest in my
schoolwork
at all now they told me they expected me
to get a's and they expected me to go to
college
and it was just an expectation which
they drilled my mother
especially drilled into us from birth
you're going to college you're getting
a's but
how i did that was entirely up to me
not once did my mother or father offer
to help on my homework i don't remember
even asking and
yeah i'm saying in the comments same
here same here so
when i graduated college just try to
imagine this experience in 2021.
so i graduated college with a little bit
of money i got from graduation and some
i'd saved up
i had about two thousand dollars i guess
in savings
from mowing lawns plus you know
graduation gifts
and i took two suitcases and the the one
suit i owned
that i think i got from sears i bought a
suit from sears
and i wore my suit on an airplane took
my two
pieces of luggage and moved to
california and with no plan
figured it out that's it i actually flew
across the country
to spend the rest of my life without a
plan
the plan was to sleep on my brother's
couch
and look for a job if you can call that
a plan
second part of the plan was to find the
the first job i could get
at the best company in the field that i
wanted which was finance
i was an economics major so i took a job
as a bank
teller for uh
the the fastest moving technologically
you know
uh superior company called crocker bank
later they were bought by wells fargo so
i took the worst job i could at the best
company i
signed up for every training course they
can i
later in later years i got my mba at
night
and i basically built a talent stack
they gave me a lot of options that got
me all the way to here
now i had zero help
from my parents on the details i had a
hundred percent help
from my parents on the mission
and the mission was always the same
you're going to do well in school
you're going to go to college you're
going to be rich
now i'd have to ask my siblings if they
were also told they were going to be
rich but
my parents told me that
and sure enough i had an expectation
i had all the support i needed i didn't
need anymore
didn't want anymore and i'm pretty sure
that the fact i had to figure out so
much on my own
is like a superpower i don't i don't
i never encounter a situation where i
don't know what to do
i mean that's that's an exaggeration i'm
sure i do but
i go through my life thinking i can
conquer just about anything
because that's my experience nobody
jumped in to save me
so i either failed you know i either
sank or swam
and so far i'm swimming so
i believe we may be destroying an entire
generation by being helpful we might be
destroying them by being helpful
it's scary um this governor cuomo
story and the the nursing home's
deaths is just getting worse oh my god
you know i've been telling you that um
as a as a standard of behavior
i didn't want to be the one who was
tough on any of our leaders
if they got anything wrong during the
coronavirus
and i've been applying that to cuomo
trying to be consistent and saying
yes it's true that very bad things
happened
i feel like we would need to know the
details of exactly what
caused him to sign off on the decision
to send 9 000 infected people back into
the worst place they could be sent
i feel as if now it seems to me that i
saw him saying in an interview
that he was following federal guidelines
at the time
can somebody confirm that is that is
that his actual
explanation that they were the federal
guidelines and he just followed them
consul give me a fact check on that
anyway
uh the news i follow tends to
consistently leave out
whatever it is that cuomo cuomo says as
his response to why all these people
died all right i'm looking in the
comments
yes i'm saying yes all right now if you
watch fox news they'll just never
mention that
they will just never mention that
according to cuomo and i'm not saying
it's true i'm just saying according to
cuomo
that he has a pretty good explanation
on paper whether you buy it or not but
on paper
that's a pretty good explanation now
somebody says he had a hospital ship and
he had the javits
center that's true but i put myself in
his situation and i ask you this
would you have sent infected people
to those assets if you thought you
didn't need to use them
and you might be able to close them down
and save a
ton of money later that might be the
federal government's money but still who
wants to waste a bunch of money
so i put myself in this situation and i
tell you this
i'm not positive i would have acted
differently than cuomo
in that situation are you
be honest are you positive
that if you were in that situation you
would have acted differently
i'm not i'm not positive of that
which is why i you know have been soft
on this
topic because if you put me in that
situation and somebody
and you know i'm making a decision a
minute because it's the pandemic
plus i'm still the governor right i've
got a whole pandemic
on top of my job which is a full-time
job
a million decisions somebody comes and
says what do we do with the
the seniors the federal guidelines says
send them back to the nursing home just
make sure that they're
you know separated or whatever so you're
making a million decisions
the federal government tells you what to
do
in this exact situation and you know
that they've looked into it
you're not supposed to be the expert
you're not the cdc
so the federal government says send them
back and you're making a million
decisions
you go yeah here send it back and then
you go on to your other million
decisions
if you can tell me that you say you
would not have done the same thing cuomo
did
and i don't know if i'm describing it
correctly right so i'm seeing a little
pushback i might not be describing the
situation correctly
but my point is if you weren't there
if you weren't there i don't think you
know what except what happened
and that's that's why i'm still putting
a little bit of reservation
on a complete blame of cuomo for a bad
decision
that killed thousands of people who
didn't need to die
but the story got
way worse way worse
i reached the limit of where i can give
somebody the benefit of a doubt
yeah i see it in the comments apparently
his staff and he must have known about
it
lied to cover up the number of deaths
and they lied because it would look bad
if they said the real number
and they've admitted that that's that's
now in fact
that they lied about the number because
they didn't want to look so bad
that's grounds for removal from
office all right there is nothing i can
say to soften that
right i mean i've been pretty
pretty generous wouldn't you say i'm
trying to apply the same standard that i
applied to
trump and any other leader trying to
apply the same standard to cuomo trying
to be fair
but when i heard that they lied about
the number of deaths
and it looks reliably like that's true
you always have to be careful we're
still in the fog or it's a new story
might not be true but it looks true
that's unforgivable that's a crime
isn't it i mean i think it's a crime
that's unforgivable
so if it turns out that the the facts
are correct
i don't think cuomo can remain in in
office
i just don't see how that's possible i
mean he might
remain in office but i don't see how
that could make sense for the public
all right here's a observation which i
make a lot and every time i do
there's some new evidence to support it
it goes like this
democrats think in terms of goals
a goal for example would be everybody
is out of poverty pretty good right that
would be a good goal
get everybody out of poverty now the
goal would be you know something for the
environment and
uh climate change etc so the
the democrats are good on goals in fact
i like
i like a lot of their goals because
they're they're social good kinds of
goals
everybody treated nice everybody's got
equal
equal opportunities those are good goals
very good goals republicans
have a slightly different take on things
and this is just an observation
doesn't mean everyone right sort of a
general observation
and republicans tend to be systems
oriented that is to say we don't know
what the final outcome will be
and we don't know how long it will get
would take to get there and we don't
even know if we can get there
we'd like a world where there's nobody
in poverty but we can't make that a goal
but we can make a system that does the
best job of getting us there
and if you design your systems right
let's say your your capitalism systems
and your your democratic systems your
government systems your
legal system if you get all those
systems working right
then the goals take care of themselves
as much as can be
right you maybe can't get to the
ultimate end point
but it's the best you can do
now look at uh mitch mcconnell's
statement
many of you saw in which he talked about
the impeachment outcome
in which the president was acquitted
mitch mcconnell
voted to acquit the reason was
systemic mcconnell said
i don't think that the senate has
jurisdiction
over someone who's not in politics
anymore
now the democrats would say wait a
minute
we've got the this precedent we've got
this legal precedent we've got this
history
where we've got this case where you
really can do that
but here's the thing suppose you really
could do that
let's say the democrats were right let's
say the law was on their side
let's say they could impeach somebody
who's out of office
should they should they
is that a system that you would want
going forward
do you want that to be your system that
that applies
forever
i very much agreed with mitch mcconnell
now he may have been inconsistent with
case law
but he's not inconsistent with what
makes a good system
and a good system is why the
does the senate have any control over a
private citizen
after they're out of office now
obviously in
the sense of making laws that's their
job but in terms of impeachment
what the do you have to do with
that
i don't care what the case law is
doesn't matter what the case law is it's
obvious that's a bad system
to punish something somebody after
they're out of office
now as mcconnell says and others say we
do have a legal system
if trump did something that the legal
system needs to deal with there's no
restriction on that
right but mitch mcconnell
i completely back his decision exactly
the way he did it
i like i liked the entire thing he did
now he was very hard on trump
for his responsibility for the capital
attack
do you do you feel the same as mcconnell
does about the capital attack
do you feel like mcconnell was maybe a
little too hard on the president
i don't care i don't care at all
here's why we have this dumb system
where the victims of the crime in this
case the
politicians who are actually at the
capitol
they're the victims of the crime they're
the ones with ptsd
they're the ones who are being hunted
they're the ones who are afraid for
their lives
mcconnell is a victim of the
crime
that he was on the jury
to judge what kind of a system
puts the puts the victim or the victim's
family on the
 jury what kind of a system is
that
if you put the victim on the
jury
don't expect them to say nice things
about the perpetrator of the crime
mitch mcconnell should have gone i won't
use the word should i hate that word
it seems entirely appropriate to me
that the victim of the crime is a little
bit
pissed off put yourself in mitch
mcconnell's place
you are in the capital and you don't
think your president
did enough to save your life
i probably would have voted to impeach
just leave that hanging there
if i had been in the senate and i
or even just my colleagues had been in
the capitol building
and i didn't think the president did
enough to stop it
i wouldn't even care what the charges
were
i wouldn't even care what the
impeachment articles were
i i wouldn't even care about any of it i
would vote to
impeach that guy if i were the victim
now i'm not the victim so i get you know
i get the the advantage of
you know being outside the system a
little bit so i've got
a little bit more objectivity but in my
in my opinion anybody who is in the
building
ted cruz anybody else
could have voted to impeach i would have
done it just as a victim
forget my forget my responsibility to
the public
i wouldn't even i wouldn't even care so
maybe you shouldn't beg me a senator
because i would have ignored the law i
would have ignored the facts
except the the one fact that i didn't
think the president did enough to save
my life i i'd care about that
and i wouldn't care about one
thing else so i backed
mitch mcconnell's take on this 100
um and i actually respect him for using
a
a technical argument that i agree with
that the senate should not have
jurisdiction even though maybe
technically they do
so a standing ovation for mitch
mcconnell
for the way he handled this as a victim
as a victim
right if that's the system putting
victims on the jury this is what you're
going to get
so good for him all right
um
so i think that going forward
i'm going to always say that trump uh
was acquitted of two impeachments and
therefore was
was essentially not impeached now i know
that impeachment is
sort of like just a stain that's
supposed to be on the record
it's not exactly like indicting somebody
but you know in the criminal system if
you indict somebody for a crime
and then they go to they go to trial and
the jury finds them not guilty
what do we say to that person do we say
well there was an indicted person
no we don't talk of it that way because
that wouldn't be fair
we talk about it as as a person who's
been found not guilty that's how we talk
about
but if you get impeached which is a
little bit like indictment
and then you get acquitted we still say
you were impeached
is that fair it seems to me if the
impeachment doesn't go
all the way to the point of impeachment
the point is removal from office
if it doesn't go to that point can you
say an impeachment
succeeded i would say it's two
failed impeachments
you could say they were impeachments but
they were failed impeachments
it was two attempts to impeach them they
failed
and then people could say but there was
an impeachment
and then you can say yes there totally
was there was a failed impeachment
there was an unsuccessful one and then
they'll say no no
it was successful because the
impeachment part is separate from the
trial part to which you say
what's the point of the first part
what's the what's the purpose of the
first part without the second part
would you even do that because it's just
a sensor sensure
if it doesn't go to removing from office
it's just accenture
it's not really an impeachment so just
to be annoying to democrats because i
know they'll hate it i'm going to say
that there were two
impeachment attempts but neither of them
succeeded
uh trump wins the doubleheader uh i saw
a tweet from
don jr this morning talking about what a
bad week
the democrats have had everything from
the impeachment results to
the the self-immolation of the
lincoln project to governor cuomo's
problems
it's a really bad week and that's not
even counting what biden has done or not
done
so um
here's the weirdest dumb story
uh somebody named tj t.j
ducklow it's spelled just like a duck
and then with an lo on the end
so he was biden's deputy press secretary
and i guess
politico was going to do an article
about him
and her no somebody was going to do an
article about him
about a relationship he had with some
other reporter axios was going to do
article about ducklow's alleged
relationship with a reporter for
politico
now is that a fair story yes
it is fair to report that if somebody is
in a romantic
situation if one is a reporter and one
works for the press corps that's fair
right or one works for the white house
press corps or not the white house uh
communications
group so it's perfectly fair
that they were going to do the story now
what's reported is that
tj ducklow uh threatened the reporter
when he found out she was going to do
the story and his threat was that he
would destroy her
and he was at first they were gonna give
him a week off without pay or something
but then he quit which means basically
he got fired
so um i'm gonna throw you a
uh gonna throw you a curve here
and i'm going to defend tj ducklow
but you didn't see that coming
and here's my defense the phrase i'm
going to destroy you
is number one typical political speech
it's not typical where you work but it's
typical political speech
that threat is probably the most common
threat that anybody's ever used
and it's better here's the second part
totally justified and legal
legal and justified just as
the reporter doing a story about this
which would end up
you know ruining this guy's career etc
totally justified
the reporter is completely within her
rights to do the story
and it's a legitimate story completely
within her rights to
to do the story but ducklow
is completely within his rights to
destroy her life
i mean beating her career when he says
i'll destroy you that should be
interpreted as
career-wise it should not be interpreted
the dumb way
which is some kind of violence or
anything like that
i feel like that's fair
and you know it seems worse because
one's male and one's female so it takes
on that extra
dimension but telling people that you'll
destroy them
if you if they destroy you
if it's all legal everybody's acting
legally
i don't know i don't know i feel like
this is kind of normal behavior
it became a story so you know biden had
to deal with it
he probably did the right thing but i'm
not sure this was so bad
i'm looking at your comments somebody
says i'm okay with this
so you can defend that but it was joe's
promise to not tolerate
bad behavior joe kept his promise joe
kept his promise
because he's gone now i'm going to give
joe a pass on that
now it looked like he was going to get a
week off but as soon as there were some
pushback from the public
probably that's when biden got involved
my guess is that biden really wasn't
involved in a lower level decision like
that
but i think he probably said when
somebody said hey biden you said you'd
get rid of people who acted this way
i think he kept his promise and got rid
of him
you know now it's reported that he
resigned but i imagine it's the same
thing
all right so you don't have to agree
with me on that
but uh that's my take
uh biden said he uh uh
in talking about the impeachment biden
said that he denounced violence and
extremism
and said americans have a duty to defend
the truth and defeat the lies
this is the man who ran and based his
campaign
on the find people hoax which was
debunked in front of the entire world
in front of congress on every network
the biggest lie ever told the most
damaging one by far
and and he's coming out
in favor of uh truth and defeating the
lies
now his entire campaign was built on a
lie that has just been debunked
but will the press call him on that they
will not
um here's a question for you
the biggest complaint about trump was
that he had to know
his his words would cause the kind of
violence that we saw at the capitol
that trump had to know it because
common sense says if you keep talking
about the election being stolen
and then you talk the way you talked
that any reasonable person
in that situation would have known that
those words
would lead to violence but here's the
question
why didn't why didn't the security
people know that
the people who were in charge of
security for the capital
why didn't they know that because they
didn't have enough security if trump was
supposed to know that
but all the people who listened to him
talk
didn't know it why wouldn't they know it
what about the press the press is pretty
clear
when they say that anybody should have
known that these words would lead to
violence
was the press tell you that the capital
was going to be attacked yesterday
before it happened did the press
did the press warn you did the press say
hey why isn't there enough security
we can all see that this will lead to
violence
did they i don't think they did
so what you're seeing here is a
hindsight
persuasion they're trying to make you
believe
that what is obvious today was
also obvious before the capital attack
now i watch a lot of politics and i
listen to
most of what the president says i had no
idea
that the capital would actually be
like penetrated no idea
did you how many of you
listening to everything that trump said
watching the news
how many of you knew that the capital
would be breached
i kind of assumed that they would have
security
right now i knew that
there would be protests no matter which
way things went
protests were guaranteed but i also
thought
that the protests in cities would look
just the way they always do
too many things get destroyed but i
figured that any kind of protest
in the capital would not penetrate the
actual
capital how many of you
with all of your common sense and
judgment and and
watching the news how many of you knew
that the capital was going to be
attacked
right zero
we didn't know that you know you could
make the same argument about
a million different uh statements by a
million different politicians
sometimes people say things and then
sometime after that a bad thing will
happen related to the thing they said
does that mean they caused it
i think it's just sometimes bad things
happen and sometimes people were talking
about them before they happened
that's probably all that's going on here
all right so that's another thing that
the
the the press which is completely
illegitimate as you know both the left
and the right at this point
um they don't tell you what i just told
you which is that nobody knew it
was gonna happen
and they imagine that trump is suddenly
the smartest person in the world
their entire case depends on the fact
that you will believe they've been lying
for five years
that they were lying about how
insightful and smart
trump is because the entire case depends
on him being smarter than all of us
because somehow he knew the capital
would get penetrated
or that violence would happen in some
way but you didn't
you didn't know it i mean i didn't know
it
but i guess he's the smartest person in
the world now because he should have
known it
um
if you hear the story about there was
some angry phone call with uh
mccarthy and trump during the capital
assault
where people were breaking through
mccarthy's windows and
trump allegedly was not too concerned
about it
now i don't know what did or did not
happen in that phone call
but i would say of all the news this
week that you should not
trust to be accurate it would be this
story
these stories are never accurate the
ones where somebody's reporting with
somebody else said to somebody else
they're never accurate never
like actually zero times you could
depend on this to be true
zero times so
yeah they just don't believe any of it
you should discount that
the democrats when they got their final
closing argument amazingly
did not address the fact that the
trump's lawyers
had pointed out that they had
manufactured evidence
in a number of cases a number of
instances
manufactured evidence faked
evidence and showed it to the world in
public
that actually happened and it got called
out
not just the find people hoax video they
showed
but also there was the fake tweet uh
that they took in a context and added a
added a blue check and i saw um
van der veen being interviewed by cb at
one of the cbs
local stations i think and uh
well i tweeted it this morning you have
to see
vanderveen answering the press and just
eviscerating the press uh
you have to see this but as he pointed
out
the democrats didn't even address the
didn't even address it they simply
ignored
the fact that the evidence had been
manufactured by their own team
now if the democrats had even and just
an iota of let's say
uh usefulness or morality or ethics
the managers would have said oh my god
it looks like the evidence we presented
wasn't even real
and they should have just dropped the
case and said all right you're right
we quit and we resign right now if they
had ethics but they don't
so what do you make of the fact
that they didn't even address the fact
that there was manufactured evidence
now as van gaven points out if this had
been a criminal trial
that would be the end of the trial if
you know that the
the prosecution makes up evidence that's
the end of the trial
you don't need to hear the other stuff
that's a that's a pretty good standard
and it gets worse
so by far the biggest story
of the week by far there's nothing even
close the impeachment itself
is nowhere near how big this story is
that the biggest hoax
in this country that actually determined
who's the president
biotin is probably president because of
the fine people hoax
now not by itself but it's so important
that if you took that out i don't think
you would have won
i don't think so it was so important to
the
misunderstanding of who this president
is
that i think it determined the fate of
the country and this was a lie
perpetrated by
democrats and the press right in front
of the country
super damaging uh obviously incited
death and destruction i mean i'm sure a
lot more people died from
that hoax if you put all the you know
ever
all the activity together than
the capital assault as as tragic as that
was i don't think they're even close
i think the fine people hoax is way more
damaging
even in death and destruction terms
so that's the biggest story in the
country
now do a google search on this term
impeachment find people hoax
because remember van der veen actually
used the phrase
find people hoax which is the first time
i've heard it
not from people like me on social media
um
oh i'm sure it's been in the news
somewhere but uh hearing him say
actually find people hoax made my day
but go ahead and google that google the
biggest story in the country
find people hoax put it in quotes so you
get the same results so
quotes around find people hoax the whole
thing
will it come up with a cnn story about
how the biggest hoax in the country
has been debunked nope
oh i'm being corrected somebody says
that van der veen called it the find
people
lie incorrect he called it to find
people lie
um when he gave his case when he was
doing this summary
he called it to find people hoax so he
used both terms but the last one he used
was hoax
so you will see if you search that on
google
that the the top publication i think
would be breitbart
and breitbart is largely hidden by
google intentionally their algorithm
actually hides
breitbart now the other entities are
right-leaning uh publications
that most people have not heard of if
you had google this and you were a
democrat
and you saw that the top result was
breitbart which you had incorrectly been
told
gives you fake news compared to other
outlets
not true not true all the outlets have
had problems
breitbart is probably more accurate than
any of them that's just
observationally they seem more accurate
than any of them
um and
you wouldn't read it you wouldn't read
it
and if you did you wouldn't believe it
because you've been told not to
so google is actually hiding
or the algorithm is it looks intentional
if i had to guess
without knowing i'd have to guess a
person an actual human being
did direct actions to hide the story
because i'll bet if they had not
directly tried died i'll bet it would
come up now it could be
that it doesn't come up because the
major networks
didn't cover it the biggest story in the
country by far
there's nothing close didn't even
cover it on the other networks
did fox what about fox
fox news should pop right up on the top
right you you know it got covered there
what got covered on the opinion shows
did it get covered on the news
i'm not sure it did i don't know it did
the opinion people of course talked
about it but
when you watch this happening right in
front of you
this is happening this is happening in
real time
right now the news and social media
are suppressing the biggest story in the
country
right now right now
while you watch it this is happening to
you
what do you make of that
stop calling it news scott somebody says
yeah it's not really news is it
i mean fake news is uh part of it
all right so
um i don't know which other networks are
covering it newsmax
oan probably will be on there
but i bet if you do a google search it
won't come up
now how do the fact checking
organizations cover it
politifact covers the
the find people hoax issue
and then do they conclude that the fine
people thing was true
or did they conclude that it was
false meaning it's a hoax
what do you think politico concluded
after watching it being completely
debunked
simply by showing the whole video that's
it the whole debunk is just showing the
whole video
you don't even have to add any opinion
to it so politico now of course has seen
the whole video because everybody has
if they watch the impeachment and what
did they say was it
true or was it false
here's the the politifact final analysis
quote more context is needed
 you politifact you you don't
need any more context
it's false
amazing this is happening right in front
of us
right in front of us this is happening
so here are some red lines that i've
drawn
if the republicans don't
try to impeach swalwell for
manufacturing evidence during the trial
and if they don't try to impeach biden
for spreading the fine people hoax
as the basis of his campaign
i can't support them i don't think i can
support
any republican for president who won't
try to at least raise the issue
obviously they would be unsuccessful
because the
how many democrats there are in congress
but
if they just let that lay there they're
just letting you
take an arrow in the back right
if republicans let this go
after it's been debunked and it's the
biggest story in the country
and they don't try to impeach biden over
it
they're worthless they're worthless i
just can't support anybody
who won't take this on it's the biggest
it's the biggest thing in the country
biggest story
are you just going to ignore it all
right
so um and i'll i'll go further if
there's somebody who's planning to run
in 2024
and they would like my support early
here's how to get it here's how to get
it now i don't know
maybe if it's somebody i don't like for
some other reason i'd have a problem
but you'd have a big leg up on winning
the presidency
if you try to impeach biden for the fine
people hoax
you won't succeed but you need to try
all alright you need to try you need to
try
it's not optional how can i
support a republican who won't try to do
this
for us do it for me a citizen
right do it for the people who are
watching do it for the country
do it to show people what the fake news
has done to them for the last five years
you gotta do this somebody
ted cruz you've got the balls
all right i'll use balls in a non-sexual
way
so that you know in this context uh
women can have
ovaries or bowls or whatever you want
i'll make it non-sexist
but ted cruz has the balls
i don't know if he'll do it but he has
the balls at least i don't know if
anybody else will
um
and i would look to the principle of
reciprocity here
if there's no republican who can bail
out the citizens on this fine people
hoax thing if you can't bail us out
don't expect help
because we don't ask for much right
i suppose we do ask for a lot citizens
but i don't i mean there's not much i'm
demanding
right you haven't heard me demanding
things but i do demand this
i demand this i demand this
you gotta stop leaving us out here
exposed
you can't let the fake news and and the
platforms do this to us
they're doing to this they're doing it
to us
right now as i say here they're doing it
to us give us some help
rasmussen reports the rasmussen did a
poll and found out
i don't even know how to deal with this
this result but they the question was
should public figures be punished
for saying they believe the 2020
election was stolen
democrats 54 percent of them
said public figures should be punished
for an opinion about something that
can't
be proven either way
and is important
and that 54 of democrats think they
should be
punished for that opinion
just chew on that just chew on that for
a second
you want to be even more angry you think
that made you angry i'm not done
all right feel how angry you are now and
watch me take it up a level
54 of democrats as i said
think public figures should be punished
for saying they believe the 2020
election was stolen
are you mad enough you're going to get a
little madder in a moment
21 percent of republicans agree
21 percent of republicans
think that a public figure should be
punished
for saying they believe the 2020
election was stolen
punished republicans
among all voters 35 percent
more than a third think a public figure
now keep in mind what does public figure
mean
public figure doesn't just mean elected
elected
i'm a public figure i am
a public figure it looks like uh youtube
just
oh youtube just turned me off
do you think that's a coincidence so i'm
still live streaming here on periscope
but i'm watching the youtube feed and it
just it just froze
so if you're on uh if you're on youtube
do you think this is a coincidence given
given the topic that i've just been
discussing
did you just watch youtube turn me off
did that just happen now it could be it
could be a glitch
but do you think the glitch always
happens when you're talking about
youtube hiding the news or about youtube
that
i'm sorry about google the parent
company of youtube hiding the news
is this a coincidence now
if we were not in this situation where
right now
the news is being suppressed right now
like right now it's being suppressed
then i wouldn't think this was anything
but a bug
but in the in the context where you know
that this same entity
is suppressing the news that i'm telling
you
and then you watch them suppress it
is it a bug is it a bug
i don't know could be you can't rule out
coincidence
coincidence is pretty strong but
i guess there's your freedom of speech
so i'm still seeing uh
comments uh on youtube is somebody on
youtube
tell me if you can hear me i know you
can see your own comments that are going
through but the video is frozen
uh can anybody hear me on youtube
somebody said no
no it's frozen so i guess it's just the
comments
isn't this amazing i mean think about
this
are you not a little bit blown away by
what's happening right now
like you're watching it in real time
well let me
god i'm so close to being canceled right
now you have no idea what's about to
come out of my mouth
but it would definitely change my life
so i'm going to hold it in a little bit
longer
somebody says i'm still up on youtube
but the picture is frozen
and i don't think they can hear me all
right i'm going to turn off youtube
and uh
that's that's disturbing
this should be uh a headline today
somebody says your account will be
suspended maybe so
maybe so uh well we'll see what happens
maybe i'm on the verge of getting
canceled
but we'll find out soon and i will talk
to you
well i think i'll talk to you tomorrow
i think i'll talk to you tomorrow maybe
not
bye for now
