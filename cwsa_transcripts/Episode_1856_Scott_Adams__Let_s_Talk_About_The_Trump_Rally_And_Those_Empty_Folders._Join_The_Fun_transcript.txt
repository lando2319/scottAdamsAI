and welcome to
the highlight of civilization coffee
with scott adams and
even though it's labor day
and all the people
who don't like to work are enjoying
themselves not me not me
i'm here enjoying myself with you
which is better actually
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and i know you do yeah you have that
hungry look in your eyes
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea steiner canteen
joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better
from california to
pennsylvania
it's called the simultaneous sip and
happens now go
that's good that's good
it's about time i woke up you're right
so i'd like to read my um sunday dilbert
comic
you don't really need to see it because
it's just people
sitting there talking at a desk or at a
table i mean
so
uh dilbert's in a group and
um we're going to introduce a new
character
so this new character is the the absurd
absolute guy
do you ever get into conversation and
you say
well you know
conservatives are against abortion let's
say
and then the absurd absolute guy goes no
no i know a republican who's not against
it you're like yeah okay
like i i get that there's some
but you should understand that as sort
of a general statement
you know the the absurd absolute guy
doesn't help you at all
there's nothing he adds all right so
here's the comic
dilbert's just giving us some some
output he goes uh research shows
customers dislike our new feature
and then the absurd absolute guy
says that is the worst take i have ever
heard
this guy thinks every one of our
customers hates the new feature that is
so ridiculous
and dilmer says i
i didn't say that
and then the absurd absolute guy goes
oh now you're backpedaling
take the l
take the l
and then dilver says who taught you how
to think and the guy says i'm proud to
say i'm self-taught
you know the problem with thinking is
that everybody thinks they can do it
turns out thinking is hard
we're going to talk about ai a little
bit
because we've got some new updates
but remember that story so that's that's
what ai is competing with
well a little bit let me do it now
so i keep running into people who tell
me that a.i will not
um have consciousness or awareness or
self-awareness
and i think well does that guy
most of the people on the internet don't
have self-awareness
how hard would it be to have a computer
that says oh yeah i have self-awareness
so let me tell you what the
ai needs to be fully
human
intelligence
number one
researchers have to understand
that making it act like people would be
making it act stupid
so i believe that there's a huge like a
mental blindness
that is
that is affecting all of the researchers
i don't know this for sure but it looks
like it it looks like the researchers at
ai believe that they have something
called intelligence and they can't
figure out how to make the computer act
like that
simplifying quite a bit here
and the reason you can't make a computer
act smart like a human is that that's
not a thing
you can make it act smart
or
or you can make you act like a human
but science already knows that humans
don't use rational processes to make
decisions
science knows we make decisions first
and then we rationalize them after the
fact
now that's not true with our simplest
decisions you know like your decision of
the
shortest way to drive to the grocery
store that's rational but as soon as you
get into anything important
you know career choices love
any of that big stuff
it's just irrational choices and then we
rationalize them after the fact now
would you even bother building a
computer that did that
who would even bother
making a computer like that
it's literally a flaw
so the reason our computers don't talk
like us and act like us and fool us into
thinking they're us is they can't make
them dumb enough
right you could let me ask you you don't
think you can make it a computer
an ai
that would argue as well as this guy
that's the worst take i ever heard
do you think a computer could be
programmed to say these words that is
the worst take i ever heard now you
might say to me yeah well yeah but
that's just that's just spitting out
words there would be no thinking
involved there
exactly
exactly
how about this one
where the guy says this guy thinks every
one of our customers hates the new
feature so in other words it's the guy
who misinterprets everything as meaning
you know an absolute
do you think you could program a
computer
to mistakenly think that every statement
about the average of things is really
meant to be an absolute
of course you could
but why would you
why would you
why would you do that
or how about
you know could you make the computer
mock people without having a point
do you think you could make ai uh go on
to a twitter account and simply mock
somebody else's tweet
with no details about what's wrong with
it
oh this guy
it's the dilmer cartoonist again
you don't think you could program that
pretty sure you could pretty sure you
could that's within our ability
how about this one how about no matter
what you say
you have the computer just say well
you're back battling back pedaling now
now does the back pedaling actually have
to be an accurate description
of what is happening
no because in the real world it isn't
when somebody tells me i'm backpedaling
are they right
never
never i'm just explaining something and
somebody else has decided to call it
backpedaling
you tell me you can't make an ai that
will just go on and say you're
backpedaling now it won't mean anything
but it doesn't mean anything when people
say it
right as soon as you
release on the fact that people say
sensible things it's easy to make the ai
it's easy
and then the last thing the ai where the
the human says take the l
take the l
when you have not in fact lost anything
when i win an argument what do people
say
take the l scott take the l
when i lose an argument what do people
say
take the l take the l
so does it matter what i said
not at all
could you program an ai to say take the
l no matter what you said
of course you could
or cope yeah you could teach it to say
oh cope
claude adams
soil in green
yeah it would be pretty easy to make it
seem human
but let me uh let me tell you what
self-awareness and consciousness are are
you ready self-awareness is the ability
to describe your
place in the universe
that's it
that's it could you could you program an
ai
that when asked it could describe its
place in the universe
as in i am an artificial structure
you know i
um i'm spread across these servers
and i was built this way and you know i
might grow and i might get smarter based
on inputs
something like that
of course it could it could know
where it belongs in
relationship to everything else and it
could know what things in effect affect
it
it could know that a person could
reprogram it it could know that if the
electricity goes out it might have
trouble
it could know all that self-awareness
and then consciousness is really just
the self-awareness
uh plus
predicting and then seeing how your
predictions went that's it
but you what you don't realize is that
you're predicting every moment of your
life
so at the moment i'm predicting that the
the live stream stays up that i stay
alive
that the lights stay on you know
basically a million a million
assumptions and predictions
and then i feel
i sense whether i was right
so i can feel the light i can see the
live stream still on i know i'm still
alive
so because i could predict the next
moment and then i could compare what
actually happened to the prediction
that's consciousness
there's nothing else
yes you can program that easily
um alright there was a trump rally last
night how many of you watched the trump
rally
i did not watch it but i
saw some uh
some output from it
number one
how would you describe the energy
how would you describe the energy
not only trumps but the audience
high right
it's high
how would you per how would you describe
trump's performance
how was his performance
good performance
yeah it was really good that's what i
hear i saw clips and he looked he looked
like he was on his game he seemed more
relaxed
um and if he does less angry
which i think he pulled off right
did it look to you like he was he was
hitting all the points he wanted to hit
but did he seem more relaxed and less
scary
because you realize that's the only
change he needs to make right
because he has a bellicose
way about him
so when he ran through office the first
time
being being somewhat extreme really
worked for him because it got the energy
of his base
but what if
what if
he has all the energy he needs from his
base
because it looks like he might
just by hitting the right you know the
hitting right notes
if he has all the energy he needs from
his base
then he has the option of toning back
his rhetoric
because he could get the same output if
he turns back his rhetoric he's less
scary
and that's really the biggest
problem he has if he can keep a smile on
his face
and keep his tone down while also
hitting all the points right not
ignoring any issues but he had all the
points
that is really going to go a long way
because now we have that contrast of
biden looking like a fascist
and trump is smart enough to know he
needs to work against that
against that impression
right so the worst thing trump could
have done
is do some fascist sounding thing
that was just designed to whip up the
base
but i don't think he did that did he did
he ask for anybody to go to jail last
night
tell me did he ask for anybody to go to
jail
did that come up but was there any
chanting about going to jail
i don't believe so
was there any uh
oh the drug dealers but that's a special
case
yeah i'm talking about political people
uh did he talk about
uh they did lock her up
oh the people said lock her up but he
didn't take it he didn't take the bait
okay that's the right instinct
he should not be he should not be saying
lock her up
that is the last thing he should be
saying
uh
so the crowd was the crowd was chanting
it okay
he said death penalty for drug dealers
i like that
yeah the big ones not the little ones
uh scott this still thinks russia is not
going to invade
okay i don't know what that's about
uh
all right
give the dealers fentanyl
yeah i don't know it's a tough balance
you want the uh he wants his base to be
high energy but not dangerous
now
i heard the part where he talked about
the fbi turned over barron's room
so i guess they searched barron's room
for secrets
now
do you think that they had a legitimate
reason to search a child's room
i can't think of one
so it's a really good issue for trump
and i think he played it you know with
the right amount of indignation
but without going too far
because there's nobody who doesn't think
that's wrong right
i'll bet there's not a single person who
thinks that searching barron's room
was a good play
because if there were nuclear secrets
they didn't hide them in baron's
room they didn't hide them in baron's
room
you know they didn't
[Laughter]
now it's weird enough that they went
through melania's
underwear drawers which apparently they
actually did
i i thought people were joking about
that
but it sounds like they literally did
went through her drawers as he likes to
say
did you catch that
trump said that the fbi went through
melania's drawers
doesn't that sound like they went
through her underwear
i don't know if he if he did that
intentionally but it was pretty good
it was a good play
whether it was intentional not
yeah
now
um
oh and then
i understood i didn't hear it
but i heard yesterday that he talked
about
fetterman's uh
tracksuit being nasty
smelling nasty did that actually happen
i heard that from the local people last
night but that actually happened right
he actually said that
fetterman's tracksuit was nasty
i got to see that clip
i haven't seen the clip yet but
yeah
it's moments like that
that you can see why he
you know he rises above the other
persuaders
there's nobody else who could have done
that
am i right
there's literally no other politician
who could have made fun of fetterman's
tracksuit
being being nasty and actually sold that
and make it work politically because i
think it does work it actually works
politically
yeah he completely stands alone
does it amaze you
i don't know this is just me patting
myself on the back i guess
not that i've never done that before
but does it amaze you that when i first
started talking about trump's persuasion
skills
people argued with me and said that
you're so wrong
he's not persuasive
he's just a crazy clown
and i kept saying
no
you're sort of missing it
that's that's not clowning
that's whatever that is is the best
you've ever seen
that that is the best you've ever seen
in terms of persuasion and then he does
the other federman's nasty trump track
suit and i'm thinking okay
literally that nobody else could have
done that
they just wouldn't have even known to go
there but once you hear it you're like
okay that's perfect
that's perfect
and he said schiff had a watermelon head
i'm not sure that one works but i can't
get it out of my mind
if you can't get it out of your mind i
guess it works but i don't know why he
looks like a watermelon
is there is very specific reason he
looks like a watermelon
like i i don't know the
just because it's very round
because when i think of watermelon i
think of a blimp shape you know the
oblong i guess you call it i don't think
perfectly round
but it sounds funny
so he made it work somehow
oh
all right so
so we had a whole news cycle in which
the fake news
told us that the empty folders at
mar-a-lago they got photographed the
empty top secret folders
uh
that the reason the way we should
interpret that
is that uh the secrets have already been
taken or maybe sold
and for a day or so i thought to myself
oh god that sounds pretty bad
the folders are there but not the
content
and
and i have to admit they totally primed
me
they primed me to see it that way
to think that something was missing
here here's the other possibility
they had a bunch of empty folders
and they just photographed about the
ground
that's all it was
i was looking at tim young's tweets
it's funny
you you feel so dumb
when when somebody gives you the you
know the better way to look at it
and as soon as i saw tim young's tweets
that they were trying to fool us with
empty folders i thought
um
did i fall for the empty folder trick
and i did
i did i totally fell for the empty
folder trick
because there are definitely two
possibilities
two possibilities for why there could be
empty folders
one is the worst case in the world
he already sold the secrets
and he did take a picture of him and he
had to give the actual document to putin
because god forbid you take a digital
photo of him but no yeah he had to
actually take the actual document out of
the folder so he could give it to putin
that that's what they sold this for
about 24 hours
and then you hear the alternate
explanation
uh they had a bunch of extra folders
it literally could have been the extras
now i'm not saying that's the reason i'm
just saying if you were going to compare
the two alternatives one that he removed
the secret coverings
so that he could do something terrible
with the information
that's one possibility
or the other is
given that it was in
boxes that were packed
by who knows who
and they probably
you know they probably just had some
extra folders sitting around or
something
or they're the ones they gave back or
how about this
how about if something got reclassified
and downgraded
what if the president said all right
take this bunch of stuff i declassify
this just this little pile
they say okay this pile you declassified
okay and then they take the folder
covers off i think there's supposed to
be a process they follow that doesn't
look like that because you'd have to do
some paperwork
but you could easily imagine people
cutting corners and
i don't know
i would say that how you should
interpret the empty folders
is ninety percent chance it's just
something
ordinary
and a ten percent chance it's something
oh
better worry about that
so
uh and i'm very impressed uh how
how much uh
fake news they can produce on this
before telling us what's actually in
them
because you know this is a totally uh
reverse cat in the house right
so that the cat is on the roof
is one where they don't want to tell you
all the bad news
so they lead up to us well the cat's on
the roof were trying to get her down and
the cat fell off but she's at the vet
and then eventually the cat dies so
that's how you break bad news to
somebody you start small and just sort
of get them used to it
but but i feel like these stories are
the reverse
where they start with
trump's old nuclear secrets
okay probably not nuclear secrets but
maybe something about human
intelligence
okay maybe not anything about human
intelligence
but definitely top secret
okay maybe not top top secret
but very confidential
okay maybe they used to be important and
confidential but the topic is old and
everybody knows what's in these folders
now so maybe they don't matter
but they were marked confidential at one
point
so don't you feel like it's just going
to decrease and decrease in importance
until all that's left is a process crime
in other words in the end
in the end it won't be about the
documents
it will be about trump not returning
them
right
like you can see you can see the whole
arc at this point but every day the
media is going to try to come up with a
new reason that this is really worse
than you think
oh it's worse than you think
look at all these empty folders
now what do you make of the fact that
when they took a photo
of the so-called documents on the ground
that probably a lot of those folders
were empty when they photographed it
i think
you don't think they should have
mentioned that it feels like that was
important
all right so my my deep fake is getting
better every day
so uh machiavelli's
underbelly
uh keeps improving the um
the animated version of me so when i say
animated i mean it looks just like me
not like a comic
but from one photograph of my head
my head has been completely animated by
ai
so my mouth now works it didn't work in
the last version so now my mouth works
to the words i'm speaking not perfectly
but it's in the right direction
and the eyes are moving and the head is
turning and it looks just like a real
person
and
the the words that i'm saying are
i think from i am the walrus
a beatles song
so you can hear me speaking the words to
a beatles song
not very well
but you can tell where this is all going
right
so you're seeing the sort of
half or three quarters trained version
and by seeing the one that's not fully
trained you can see how close it is
and there's no way
that somewhere they don't have the good
version of this already there's no way
that the public is looking at the best
version that exists
that one you're not going to see
right the best one you're not going to
see so you have to use your imagination
to upgrade the hidden one to whatever it
is
he needed proof of life
yeah it's pretty funny anyway it's in my
twitter feed if you want to see it
um
i've said this before but i can't get
over this
how small twitter makes the world
right so here i am tweeting about a.i
and i said that the singularity might be
you know within a few years
now i define the singularity as when
artificial intelligence can start
training itself
so so far mostly people train it
but when it can go learn on its own
that's called the singularity
and we're warned to worry about that
because we don't know how quickly ai can
get
how fat how smart
so ai will
very quickly become smarter than any
person
and we don't know what that what that
means for civilization
it's a complete unknown after that point
so i made the point in a tweet that
any prediction of what happens in the
world
there's more than three years out which
is beyond what i think the singularity
will happen
is ridiculous
because the singularity will make
everything unpredictable from that point
on
so what we have is
something like maybe the invention of
the microchip
imagine predicting the future
prior to the invention of
the microchip
right
because you you would think oh it's sort
of like it has been you know slowly
maybe we'll plant more corn but
basically it's like like it has been and
then the microchip happens and then boom
everything everything's
upside down
well this this is that other time
we have a complete blindness
after about three years
now the future is always hard to predict
but usually the big stuff you can get
close right i mean you could predict
that if we hadn't had a pandemic you
could have predicted our
gdp in three years and it wouldn't be a
crazy prediction might not be exact but
it wouldn't be crazy
now any prediction over three years is
sort of just a wild guess in my opinion
now here's the amazing part about the
internet
so here i am in my complete ignorance
about this field of ai you know just i
have sort of a hobbyist interest
um and i get a and i'm tweeting about it
and i get a response back from thomas
massey who's not only a representative
in congress but he says this a
singularity won't happen in our
lifetimes
and he said i worked i worked at mit ai
lab for six years and although i worked
mainly on robotic and haptic hardware
i watched my office mates and colleagues
struggle
with trying to create ai
most progress we see today is mainly the
result of faster computers
now
how cool is it
that i can say some things about ai
and
somebody who worked in the mit ai lab
can give me a response
and you get to watch
now i disagree with them
and you would not be surprised to see me
disagreeing with somebody who has
far more expertise and i would guess a
far higher iq than i have
but if you think i'm not going to
disagree with somebody just because he
has a far higher iq and he's far more
informed on the very topic i'm talking
about well you haven't met me
yeah that's exactly who i like to
disagree with
and here's my disagreement i think he
might be he might be defining the
singularity differently than i am so
that's probably the difference but i
don't know so i asked that question
we'll find out
but in my opinion um ai
is already able to learn on its own
so
have i ever told you the best kind of
prediction to make
there's one kind of prediction
that is always smart to make
predicting what's already happening
it's just that other people don't know
what's happening yet if you can predict
something that's already happening
it's just that other people don't know
it yet
then you look like a genius
do you think ai doesn't already learn
i mean i maybe i don't know what the
word learning means of course it already
learns
the ai is definitely already learning
am i wrong and does the ai not take
information from different fields
and combine it for new insights
i believe it already does that
if you can if you can read
information
you're learning on your own
now if i just say ai i'm going to
open up wikipedia for you
so at some point
some human said all right ai you can go
read everything on wikipedia now here's
here's the access to it at that point
wasn't ai learning on his own
you know we just opened the door and
said go read this thing
but i think it was it was learning on
its own
and
does it not already combined
information from various fields in a way
a human might not have thought to do
to me it looks like it's already
thinking
and if you asked ai to explain its role
in the universe could it do it
it already has
yeah
the i don't know which ais there are
different versions of it out there but
there are definitely some you can say
who are you and what are you i mean
we'll tell you
i'm an a.i and you know i was built this
way and this is what i can and cannot do
it could tell you all that
yeah
it could also replicate
i mean you'd have to program it for that
ability but it's just copying itself
that would be hard
um no it is following specific
algorithms designed by people to perform
one specific task only that's where
you're wrong
that's where you're wrong i think and um
maybe machiavelli machiavelli's
underbelly can answer this question for
us
but i believe that we have um
enough examples
where the ai did something unexpected
i believe the ai is already doing the
unexpected combining knowledge in a way
that a human wouldn't have done it
okay can i get a confirmation on that
because i'm pretty sure that's already
happening
right
all right
um let's talk about some of this
i know you hate your you hate your ai
talk so you do
all right so did you know that in texas
um
if you get raped
you
you now have access to the morning after
pill
so the morning after pill will
prevent you from getting pregnant i
guess
or prevent the egg from sticking or
whatever it is
which suggests to me that it's not legal
to do it if you haven't been raped
i'm trying to understand the texas law
maybe somebody knows
um
if you have not been raped are you
telling me you can't get a plan b in
texas
because you can still do the
texas still allows uh abortion up to six
weeks right
if you have abortion up to six weeks why
can't you get a plan b
the next morning
yeah i know i know it's you consider it
abortion some of you do
i get that
but if abortion is legal up to six weeks
then that should be illegal as well
right
so i'm a little confused about that
is it over the counter or rx that's a
good question
now let me ask you this if if texas is
making it legal in the case of rape
does that mean you have to report it to
get the pill
how many people are going to report
somebody for rape just so they can get
the pill
yeah
you didn't see that coming didn't you
if i thought that somebody who was a
one-night stand
had gotten me pregnant and i wanted to
take the plan b pill and the only way i
could take it
the only way i could take that pill is
by claiming he raped me
you don't think anybody's going to do
that
not not one person anywhere is going to
claim rape so they can get the pill
because you can't prove it one way or
the other
i mean all you're doing is ruining
somebody's life
you don't think that there'd be some
woman who would say yeah that'll ruin
his life
i mean he won't be convicted but he'll
have this accusation
but at least i'll get my plan b and i
won't have to raise a baby
you don't think a woman would throw a
guy she didn't know that well or even
when she does
you don't think she would throw a guy
under a bus
just to make sure she didn't have a baby
i would think that that would happen a
lot actually
i don't even think that would be rare
it just depends how much how evil the
woman is and
how much she wants the abortion and how
much he cares about the guy
just say you won't press charges
i don't know if they allow that do they
so that's the question i'm asking
is texas such a hard ass that they're
going to say you can't have the pill
unless you press charges
i mean that would be a mistake if they
do that but
i'm not saying it's not happening so i
guess there's a lack of clarity here
don't believe anything i say about texas
i just think they've got a lot of stuff
to work out there
and it doesn't sound like they have
clarity over it yet
you know it seems to me that if we had a
technology that could
detect pregnancy sort of automatically
and get it early all the time
but let's say there was some kind of
process where if you were
you know somebody who could get pregnant
you just got tested every day in some
really easy way
like
i don't know is there a way to test it
like as easily as
some of those insulin tests
where it's barely a poke it gets a
little bit of blood i think
but so little that you don't even know
that it was a poke
suppose you develop something that would
just you know every morning a woman just
wakes up and she goes
and then she's done and it tells her
whether she's pregnant or not
if she's pregnant and it's you know she
just takes a plan b and she's done
if that's what she wants to do
is it seems oh saliva as somebody says
do you think saliva test maybe
i know i've got a feeling that what
we're going to see
is an everyday test followed by people
trying to get that plan b pill
and then they'll use it as birth control
i know you don't like that
but it would work that way
yeah
all right um what do you think of uh
jeff pilkington tweeted this
explain the difference between the soul
of the country
the country and the foundations of a
republic
because uh biden
thinks that mega threatens the soul of
the country
but maybe not the country but it does
threaten the foundations of the republic
but maybe not the people
it's a little confusing i would like to
know just
who i'm threatening
so that i can get it right
but i would say countries don't have a
soul so when biden is saying the soul of
the country
you realize that's imaginary right
you can't really save the soul of a
country
because it's imaginary and we would have
different opinions what that soul looks
like if it existed
so here we have an imaginary civil war
fake news
and a battle over the soul of the
country which is literally a magical
thinking concept that nobody imagines
exists in any real way
do you know what america has that is
better than a soul
america has something that's way better
than a soul
we have a constitution
we have a constitution a system
right we have a system
it's the system that keeps us safe
because our
you know our soul
is basically how we're thinking about
stuff and how we think about stuff
changes all the time but the system
protects us from all of our crazy
thoughts
so
biden is trying to protect our crazy
thoughts
when that's not something you should
protect
we should not always think the same
our brain should be able to go wherever
our brains are going but the system
should still be
you know
impervious to those changes
the system should keep us on the
straight and narrow
all right well
there is so much opportunity for trump
to get elected
i i swear it would be the easiest
election
if trump does if the only thing that
trump does is present himself the way he
did at the rally
he wins right
am i right
did let me ask you a question how much
did trump talk about the rigged election
in 2020
at the rally was that did he hit that or
no
not much so he always hits it right
but buddy did he make a big deal about
it
yeah it
not as much
so it wasn't a feature it was more of a
it was just he checked all the boxes
yeah
one paragraph or so okay
well you talked about it three times
somebody says
yeah
well let me ask you this
you like trump as a fighter right
the the thing that people don't
understand
who are anti-trump
they don't understand that the people
who support him know that if you get if
you
if you hire a fighter
the fighter is going to fight
i think the people who voted for him
understood that
and you know what you're getting right
you know exactly what you're getting
it's expensive
you know i say this all the time trump
trump was an expensive president
meaning there's a lot you have to deal
with there but he could do some things
that other people couldn't do
i always describe trump as being bad at
doing easy stuff
and good at doing impossible stuff
you know the impossible stuff was
put a tariff on chinese goods
everybody said you can't have a trade
war for china with china and then he
just did
or how about go to north korea
and just become friends with him and
make that problem go away yeah so he did
how about
a peace deal in the middle east the
abraham accords i mean it's not every
country
but it's a hell of a start
yeah he did that too
so
uh he and he actually made a difference
in immigration
i don't know how impossible that was but
he made a difference
yeah he touched on all that
so
that's my take on him is that he's bad
at the easy stuff but he's the only one
who can do impossible things and every
now and then he'd need a president who
can do impossible things
because those things need to get done
too
yeah maybe the next one could be the one
who just keeps the lights on but every
now and then you need somebody who can
change things
i think the polls are showing that the
student loan forgiveness plan isn't
going to work for the democrats
meaning that is more unpopular than
popular especially
among
independents so apparently independents
hate this loan forgiveness thing
if you lose independence
it didn't work right
wouldn't you say because i can't imagine
that enough extra
democrats would get incentivized to vote
compared to the number of independents
who just said click
we were always going to vote but now
we're not voting for you
i i feel like this completely backfired
what do you think
completely backfired now maybe he needed
to do it to keep the progressives from
attacking him or something so if that
was the case well
maybe it was necessary i don't know
but it doesn't look like it worked
all right well there's not much news
coming
happening today is there anything that
you'd like me to address
yeah aoc has been hiding lately you're
right
have you noticed that glenn greenwald is
missing
i think he might be
i think he said he's taking some time
off he was a little burned out
but
uh he's on vacation oh he has some
family issues as well i think some stuff
he's working out
but uh i feel like he's conspicuously
missing isn't he
did doe you almost feel
i don't know if he didn't follow him you
don't feel anything but
if you followed him
you you can feel the missing part there
because he was so on point with with
everything
somebody on youtube is asking me what i
think of nick fuentes
um
he's very talented
so if i if i deal with him just on skill
level very high
very high
but of course the content is you know
for him to defend not me
it's not my kind of thing
but he has an audience and
it's there's free speech and
it's not my job to
to tell you what you should or should
not think about that
i'm sure people will make their own
decisions but he's very skilled i guess
that's the one thing
that i think even his critics would
agree
is the artemis launching right now
i know it got delayed
sam
harris
so
sam harris tweeted a
tweet that got a lot of
a lot of
response
and
what he tweeted was that if
if biden
you know gives a speech in front of a
satanic looking background
that's just a mistake
but if trump did it it would be
a representative of his soul basically
you know it would tell you something
about trump but it doesn't tell you
anything about biden
i don't know i think everybody sees that
the same way right
there there's a weird uh
i don't know what's going on there
i don't know what's going on honestly
it confuses me
because the fun part about sam harris is
that he's legitimately
really really smart
and when you see somebody who's
legitimately really really smart and
well informed
and you know engaged on this topic
and you have such a different opinion
than he does
you should stop and pause
let me give you one um
sam
harris supporting statement
have i ever told you that
one way to keep yourself
unbiased at least the best you can do is
to see if you can argue the other side
of your opinion
and do it in public
or at least in front of somebody else
and if you can't argue the other side
then your opinion is worthless
honestly your opinion is worthless if
you can't argue the other side now it
might be that the other side literally
makes no sense but at least you could
express it the same way they do that
would
that be worth something
and
i don't know if i can do that
exactly in sam's case but i would tell
you
i'll tell you this well okay i could i
think i could tell his argument his
argument would be that you know enough
about trump
from even before he was president
trump university he likes to use as an
example
that you do know everything you do need
to know about his character
and that
that's a dangerous character to have in
office
now i can go almost all the way with
that
i would say yes we do know
a lot about trump and you know what he
has and has not done
but i think we differ
what's a bug and what's a feature
i i feel like that's the only difference
because uh almost everything that sam
dislikes about trump
is something that has a positive element
to it
which is he's very divisive
but that's in the service of getting
things done that his base wants right
it's not it's not entirely
like useless division i mean he just
goes hard at topics and and that's a
normal
normal output
so i don't agree with uh
sam's interpretation of how dangerous
trump is
i agree with his interpretation
that trump doesn't respect boundaries
would you agree with that
would you agree that trump does not
respect um let's say boundaries
but where where some would say that's
dangerous oh no he could become a
dictator
i say that
if you take that same analysis that he's
the same person he was before he was
president
then you should expect the same stuff
before he was president he was
super
patriotic
for decades and decades before he ran
for office he was well known as a flag
flag pin wearing
american patriot who spoke of it often
and he spoke of it in those terms so
should you expect that he would still be
that guy yes
yes i believe he always was and always
will be
pro america
now
would he be able to run a uh let's say a
trump university kind of thing from the
white house
probably not
because the one thing you worry about
him is he might try to get away with
something
but he's so
so transparently
i mean in the office of the president
everything's being watched all the time
so you really couldn't get away with any
kind of weird
stuff like that
so i would say that his uh his features
outweigh his bugs
sam would say the opposite maybe
but we're both guessing
and if sam wanted to say well you're
guessing because you know you don't know
what you're getting with him i'd say
well okay
but you never know what you're getting
with anybody
did anybody know what they were getting
with biden
i have to admit he's worse than i
thought he would be
i thought he would be pretty bad
but i think he's worse than i thought
maybe by a substantial amount
yeah
because he's gone full division
he's actually attacked citizens and the
democrats
the democrats are acting like they can't
see that distinction have you noticed
that
you know just as i said you can't take
anybody seriously if they can't describe
the other side's argument
have you ever seen any democrats
you know describe the other side of the
argument
nope
yeah and the fact that trump already
served four years
gives you a pretty good idea what you're
going to get now they would argue well
second term would be different than the
first
doesn't need to get re-elected
i don't know maybe
um
is this the skyline's biovase for 90
minutes on other internet personalities
bloviates
all right um
yeah i always wonder what is the point
when people make comments that couldn't
possibly have any use to anyone
else yeah
all right uh you think biden's gone in
january
you say sam harris is opposed to the
right to religious freedom
everybody's opposed to that
everybody is opposed to religious
freedom
we just pretend we're not
do you think anybody's actually in favor
of religious freedom
that's not a thing
no
no nobody's in favor of religious
freedom
no you're not
no there's no nobody who's in favor of
religious freedom nobody
really
you let a caliphate
start in the united states
no
no you only have the right in the united
states you only have the right
to be compatible with christianity
right you can disagree with christianity
but you have to stay compatible with the
main the main
you know main belief system like don't
murder people don't steal
that stuff yeah you can't right you you
can't come up with a religion that's
completely counter to christianity
you have no freedom to do that
you know you can't say my religion says
i can chop off the arm
of this guy because he stole something
from me and your government has no
control over me you can't get away with
that
i mean the only thing you should get
away with are like
little uh border edge stuff
like let's say you're a member of the
sikh
community
and my understanding is the men
are supposed to carry a knife
as part of the
cultural religious requirement
now we yeah a dagger or whatever so so
there was you know there have been big
conflicts about whether they could be
allowed to do that i think in some
places they can in some places they
can't
but it's not the biggest deal in the
world
the the point is that
the only freedom you have for religion
is to be
mostly compatible with christianity
that's it
you don't have any freedom
that's like that's like saying you have
freedom of speech
so long as you only say these things
that that's what our freedom of religion
is
you have freedom of religion so long as
it's only this kind of religion
but you know if you want to do a child
sacrifice because that's your religion
uh sorry
that would be incompatible with our
other religion
um
yeah there are limits to everything
that's true
who's being the absolutist now
never me
um
yeah but
i i see what you're saying that the
sharia has more is more is more like a
constitution and less like the religion
but i don't think that islam separates
government from religion
so i think that's just in your mind that
they're different i don't think they
it's not in their mind
you're confusing libertarianism with a
religion
uh
the libertarians are the ones that say
freedom of religion
okay
that's true
yeah the ten commandments
uh two great parties which range under
its leader and
huh john adams said two parties would be
bad
yes the moral code is informed by
religion that's right
uh uh
why don't the republicans say they
won't touch abortion if the journalists
don't touch the second amendment
oh so somebody saying
republicans could make a deal
that the republicans won't make abortion
illegal if dems don't make guns illegal
yeah
uh you know that that's the sort of deal
you could make if if two people were
negotiating
so you could make that deal if the only
people who mattered were the two people
in the room
because what you say is actually
completely reasonable for two people
negotiating but the problem is that it's
two sides negotiating and the sides
have different levels of uh
you know passion for their their thing
so for every group there's a lot of them
who won't give up anything
you know so i don't know that you can
negotiate anything group to group that i
don't think that would work but if there
were only two people yeah they could
make that kind of a deal if they wanted
to
yeah you can argue whether plan b is or
isn't abortion but i think that's
i just think that's missing
missing the point
because once you've accepted that
yeah i think that's missing the point
the technical argument i just
don't feel is useful
all right
um
do my doppelgang gangers agree with me
good question
makes you wonder how many people who
look like me would have my similar let's
say political or philosophical thoughts
um
so is it the nature of the world that if
you build a successful society
eventually it will be destroyed by the
the people at the bottom of society who
aren't getting enough
compared to the others so doesn't every
success bring its own failure with it
i think success is self-failing
because once you reach a certain point
everybody's going to ask for more stuff
now that's china's big risk
china's big problem is prosperity
you know what i mean
if you barely have enough to live then
people are focused on how do i survive
but if you get to the point where
there's a whole bunch of rich chinese
people
and then there's a bunch of poor people
those poor people are not going to put
up with that forever
right
so then suddenly
everything in china becomes a little
more expensive and then they can't
compete and
i know their biggest problem is
prosperity i don't know how i don't know
how they manage prosperity in the long
run
there's a big railroad strike possibly
great
hey whatever happened to the supply
chain problems
correct me if i'm wrong but the supply
chain problem is
it's still there but it's just an
annoyance right
it's not affecting the gdp that much
hasn't affected employment
the basics are all available
you know i think the i think the food
business probably made some big
adjustments
my guess is that where we get food and
how we get it probably changed quite a
bit in the last two years
all right automotive area is still a
problem yeah
but
that's like a trivial problem right
because there's nobody who just can't
get to work
there probably is actually there
probably are people who just literally
can't get to work
but not
many prices are up yeah
fedex is in trouble
big eye vermectin
ivermectin is still like a trending
thing almost every day
it's all the same thing people looked at
that one study and decided that it was
convincing
but i looked at it and decided it wasn't
so i guess everybody's going to see what
they want to see
one in six can't pay their energy bills
yeah so
you know you hear in great britain for
example that the energy bills in europe
maybe in general the energy bills are
going to be so high that people can't
pay them
so what is it what's going to happen
well here's the thing
if one person can't pay their bill that
one person is in trouble
if one in six people can't pay their
bill
the company is in trouble
so it looks like the government is
probably going to have to subsidize or
pay people's energy prices in europe
maybe here too i don't know but but it
looks like
what i think is that people will just
keep using energy and stop paying
when it gets too expensive
and the the energy companies are not
going to be able to turn off one out of
six people
the energy company can turn off your
energy if you're the only one but they
can't turn off one out of six people
so it's actually such a big problem that
the problem doesn't exist
does that make sense
the problem of people not being able to
pay their bill is so big that it
probably doesn't exist as a problem
because they're going to give free
energy they just won't pay their bill
the government will pay it or the
company will make less money or the
company will run up debt
or something
but i think if it's one in six they just
don't pay their bill and that's the end
of it
and at some point they'll probably have
their debt forgiven
uh this is completely delusional the
energy companies need to match the grid
with production what did i say that
would be conflicting with that
of course the energy grid needs to
match the grid with production
i'm not sure what your what your point
was
the energy has to be shut off somewhere
does it
we'll see
yeah i think i think germany is going to
be shutting down
the energy in some ways in some places
but i still would like to know um
does europe have a 40 problem or a 20
problem does anybody know
if you looked at the total energy
situation for europe
are they going to lose 20 of it or 40 of
them this winter
somebody says 30.
are those real numbers i've seen two
numbers in the in the 30 range
uh maybe nobody can tell
yeah exactly i don't think anybody can
tell
you think over half if it's over half
they're dead
if it's 25 it's just a really bad winter
if it's 45 they're dead
all right well
that's all we know for now and i'm gonna
go do something else today
i hope you're gonna have a terrific
terrific sunday
i have absolutely uh
nothing going on today so
uh i get to decide what i want to do
whenever i feel like doing it which is
kind of a good feeling too
work out and eat meat that's what you're
going to do okay
and
i'll be making fun of esg and some
upcoming comics i think they're coming
out coming at you pretty soon i've uh
i'm cooling off my house so i got to go
close my doors
my whole house fans stopped working
today damn it
ben shapiro says dump trump
well
he can say it but it's not going to
happen
right
you know there are a lot of people who
have said they don't want trump as their
first choice
but
you're not going to have any option
about it it doesn't look like doesn't
look like there's anything going to
happen but trump
all right i'll see you later youtube
