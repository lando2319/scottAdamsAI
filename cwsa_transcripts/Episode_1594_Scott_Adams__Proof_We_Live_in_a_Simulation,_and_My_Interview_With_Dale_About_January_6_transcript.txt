oh pump
well welcome to the best thing that's
ever happened to you
we call this coffee with Scott Adams in
large part because I'm Scott Adams and
there will be coffee
but
I think we'd all agree
that no matter what you're drinking here
this is the best thing that's ever
happened to you and anybody really
I haven't done a complete survey but it
feels like common sense if you'd like to
take it up a notch and boy do we have a
show for you today do we have a show oh
yeah oh yeah and to enjoy it at its
maximum capacity all you can use a
couple of hunger a glass of tanker gel
so starting the canteen children flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dope the means the end of the
day
it's the thing that makes everything
better including the simulation
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
well I don't have many rules in my
household but one of the most important
rules is
don't make loud noises from seven to
eight in the morning
so if you could hear that shower that's
running in the wall right next to me
that would be somebody in my house who's
violating the cardinal rule the prime
directive
but it shouldn't last too much longer
well today we learned that 75 members of
Congress invested in companies that were
related to
the pandemic
um companies that have a direct stake in
the nation's response to the pandemic
75 of your elected professionals
75
are you as shocked by this as I am there
are 75 members of Congress who bought
stock in companies that were almost
guaranteed to go up because of what the
government was voting on are you shocked
well I'm shocked because I was hoping
there were more than 75 smart people in
Congress
my God are you telling me that out of
400 whatever these it was
completely legal apparently completely
legal to invest in the very companies
that they were guaranteeing were going
to quadruple in value
completely legal and only 75 of these
 did it
what the hell is wrong with Congress
seriously let's take a list of the 75
keep them and get rid of all the other
 idiots because really if it's
legal they should all be doing it or it
should not be legal pick one but I don't
want idiots running the country if it's
legal do it document it show it to us
then I might think you have some you
know ability to predict but if you're
not doing this and it's totally legal
and it's obvious it is free money
and if what 435 members of Congress 75
Smart Ones
and I'm only kidding a little bit now
I'd like to think that the other members
uh resisted for ethical reasons
what do you think do you think the other
members of Congress resisted for ethical
reasons
maybe three or four of them
I have a feeling they just are good at
investing because it's hard to explain
otherwise
all right
well it's getting harder and harder to
be a Democrat these days now that the
Democrats have decided that the
buildback better bill
uh might go on the Shelf
let's just put that back on the shelves
we tried but we're gonna have to put
that back on the Shelf
um so they thought instead of that
they'll try to Pivot and try to get
something done
and they'll move that to the election
reform
try to get something done a little
election reform
does the election of Reform include the
ability to fully audit
our votes in real time or very quickly
so that we can have full transparency in
our elections
no of course not
do you know why
because there's no politician who wants
that
do you know why no politician wants uh
actual you know good reform
because everybody who got elected wait
for it away from the big reveal
everybody who is currently elected
got elected under the current situation
that's it
why would anybody want to change the
thing that got him elected nobody wants
to change the thing that got them
elected the people who should have
nothing to do
with election reform
are people who got elected under the
current system
that's the people who should be recused
we've actually we've delegated
uh the job the most I would say
is it too far to say a sacred mission
is that too far
I mean the the core
um you know the core engine of the
Democratic Republic in which we live the
driving engine of the most important
country in the world according to
Americans
and we've delegated it to the only
people who should not be involved in
that in any way
are we happy with that yeah we're acting
like that's perfectly natural
did has anybody brought that up but me
that the only people we shouldn't be
working on this are exactly the people
we delegated it to right who else even
said that out loud
nobody right there's a there's a shower
running in the room next to me that's
the noise you hear
I'm sorry somebody else did bring it up
Matt
over on locals brought it up and I'm
disappointed in all of you for not
listening to Matt
so good on you Matt you were there early
um so I love the fact that Kirsten
Cinema is not supporting the filibuster
reform
under the perfectly good theory that if
you do that it's just going to rip apart
the Republic basically and everybody
will just undo what the other party did
and it'll just be a mess
so good for her
um what are the odds that what are the
people involved in two movies on one
screen her last name would be
Cinema
Cinema
involved in two movies on one screen
Cinema
well
if you didn't think we lived in a
simulation
there's a story coming up that will
prove that we are
wait for that
okay I have a new
um a new way to determine BS this I'm
going to add this to my
detector
uh ways to determine if somebody is
telling you the truth
and I saw this example in the uh The Joe
Rogan interview with Dr McCullough
now I want to be very careful
I'm not saying
that Dr McCullough is wrong about
anything
all right can you hear that clearly I'm
not I'm not saying he's wrong about
anything
I'm going to tell you that he flipped a
switch
that I consider a strong tell for lying
or being wrong not lying is imagining I
could read somebody's mind that's not
what's happening so I have no no
information that he would be lying about
anything
but
a strong indication that what he's
saying is not necessarily true which
doesn't mean he's lying right people
could have opinions that don't pan out
but here it goes like this
um Scott can you give me the evidence to
support your point
and I say can I give you evidence there
are thousands of citations in several
books and it's all laid out there
is it true am I tell you the truth
or am I bullshitting
I'll do it again I I'm being interviewed
Scott give me the evidence for your
point of view
evidence are you kidding me there's so
much evidence you're we're swimming in
evidence there's like thousands of
studies and citations and details and
footnotes they're across four different
books and you should read them all
and if you do
you're going to see it too
would you believe me I hope not I hope
that you're smart enough not to believe
that
here's what the truth would look like
just hypothetically
Scott give me the evidence supporting
your point of view all right well I'm
saying there's a conspiracy there's an
email that shows that person one talk to
person two who was in charge of this
decision so we can see the email that's
been confirmed it's real and this email
says go ahead and do this bad thing and
then the person who did the bad thing
replied to the email it said I'm going
to do the bad thing and then we measured
the thing to see if it was bad and sure
enough it happened
that's what
an honest opinion looks like
do you do you want to see again what a
what a not
uh I don't want to say honest because I
have no evidence that the good doctor is
saying anything he doesn't believe right
I do believe he's saying stuff he
believes so
uh it's one thing to be wrong
it's another thing to be lying and
nobody's nobody's accusing him of that
at least I'm not
um
so for all of you who are pretty sure
that Dr McCullough has the goods and
that Joe Rogan heard them and you heard
McCullum tell him to Joe Rogan can you
explain for me
why it can't be summarized
here here's the other basically here's
the summary of this detection
point
anything that can't be summarized
isn't true
watch for that anything that can't be
summarized
isn't true
watch How often that that's predictive
all right
Ted Cruz has an anti-critical race
Theory ebook had a fight fight back
against teaching it in schools
wait wait are there any are there any
Democrats watching
is there any Democrats watching what did
you just say in your head
CRT in schools
nobody's teaching CRT in schools
duh you idiots on the right you idiots
you fools
how many times do we have to tell you
the CRT is a college level course if
that is based on some theories that are
certainly not being taught in the K-12
there is no critical race Theory being
taught in K through 12. say every
Democrat who has been hypnotized by the
news
is it true
is it true that CRT is not being taught
in K-12 schools period not not anywhere
true or false
true
it's true
it's 100 true
how many uh Republicans disagree with
that
it is true there's no there's no
critical race Theory being taught in any
K-12 School
uh here's the second thing that's also
true the cons the concepts that are
related to or come from critical race
Theory are being taught in K-12 in a
fairly widespread manner
true or false
things that overlap with and are similar
to and may be suggested by perhaps
influenced in some sense by
are being taught in K-12 in a fairly
widespread way
true
so there's your two movies or your two
Christian cinemas as I like to say
um or Kirsten cinnamons sorry
um yeah and one there's no critical race
theory in K-12 and then the other one
there's plenty of it they just don't use
that label because it's the wrong label
so the Republicans are walking uh
directly into the Trap that the
Democrats have set for themselves
because they fall into their own Trap by
believing their own here's what
the Democrats or the I'm sorry this is
what the Ted Cruz's of the world should
do if it is their intention to fight
against the critical race Theory stuff
yeah yeah Anthony I see I see your point
um
here's what the Republicans should do
instead of saying we want to get rid of
critical race theory in schools they
should say
we want to get rid of teachings that
overlap with critical race Theory or
teachings that are inspired by or
teachings that are
let's say
familiar or similar to in some ways so
you need to go at it that way I'd add
the modifiers because if you don't add
modifiers people are just talking about
the word choice and there's no argument
there at all Ron DeSantis is also in
this fight
have I mentioned that Ron DeSantis is
like a freaking success machine
republican-wise right Democrats will
disagree with that uh characterization
but if you were if you're a republican
I'm not so I'm I'm just speaking as an
observer here but if you're a Republican
Ron DeSantis is just a machine
he's just pumping out one perfect
move after another am I wrong
does anybody disagree with that
characterization I've never seen
anything like it to be honest I've never
seen a politician
just
um walk up to bat about once every two
weeks
and just hit a like a rope
like he's just hitting
I'm sorry this is you know baseball
reference but but it's like he's getting
up the bat and he's hitting the first
pitch like a solid a solid double into
the Outfield
and then you say and you think to
yourself well that's something people
can do two out of ten times if they're
really good then he gets up to bat he
hits another one you're like well two in
a row anybody can get lucky and he's up
to like what
14 of these in a row or something
where he'll find some national topic
that at least you know his party the
Republicans were worked up about and
then just come up with the perfect
response
and so now he's he's got this uh
uh what is it called the uh the
anti-woke build or something like that
and so they're gonna have some
legislation proposed anyway to make it
possible for parents to Sue I think to
school
if there's any critical race Theory
related stuff there
uh yeah Scott's Sports analogies are the
worst that's true
it's a frozen rope
yeah so he said he's hitting Frozen
Ropes uh into the uh into the Gap how
about that
yeah he's hitting a frozen rope into the
gap
okay
if you like your sports analogies
that's an analogy on an analogy the
Frozen rope and then it's sort of yeah
it's a nested a nested analogy very
difficult to do
and so DeSantis is framing it as no tax
dollars to teach kids to hate each other
how good is that
how good is that framing no tax dollars
to teach kids to hate each other it's
perfect
yeah you couldn't approve on that I
don't think so that is as good as it
gets
simple Direct
now is Ron DeSantis full of
well remember what looks like
it would have looked like well you know
there's a concept of the thing and it's
in a book and somebody talked about it
in their 15 citations and if you have
the time you should go look into it
nope he said directly no tax dollars to
teach kids to hate each other is that a
fair characterization
it is it is it's not the only thing that
it teaches right you know let's let's
give some credit to the intention the
intention I think is to make the world a
better place it just doesn't do it in a
way that has greater benefits than costs
according to Republicans
all right watching uh CNN uh spin
 into gold
is so entertaining are you watching the
January 6th coverage
the the coverage will produce absolutely
nothing
and CNN will treat it like there was
something
and I'm watching the opinion people try
to you know try to cook listen to
something and it's basically they're
cooking with water
they've got a little cup of water and
they're trying to make dinner with it
and they're thinking all right where's
the other ingredients for my soup
and the Network's saying well this time
no ingredients
uh we're just going to give you a cup of
water
but it's your job to make people are
watching think that cup of water
is full of beef
but it's just a cup of water
and so I would like to uh if I may
interview my Democrat operative his name
is Dale some of you know him some of you
may may be due to him and uh Dale will
explain to me the uh the breaking
stories the Blockbusters that just
recently came out about January 6.
uh Dale are you busy just come over here
for a minute I would like to uh I'd like
to ask you a few questions about the
January 6 Blockbuster reports
glad to help glad to help what's your
question
well I keep seeing there's some kind of
Blockbuster
news but then I read the news
and I'm not actually seeing the
Blockbuster can you can you help me
connect the dots uh Dale
simple simple Republicans
am I right am I right
they're all dumb they're all dumb let me
explain it to you in the simplest way
so that even a republican can understand
it
it goes like this
there was an Insurrection on January 6th
is now proven
and the proof positive
is that there was an email from Hannity
to Mark Meadows
saying that the President should call
off the you know the riots
and therefore insurrection
okay
um
okay Hannity sent an email
but that doesn't really seem to be in
any way related to your point that there
was an insurrection
there are two facts
or there's a claim and then there's a
fact can you just like connect
the claim to the fact I'm missing the
connecting tissue there
Republicans am I right
I don't know if I can make this any
simpler there was an email
it's a Blockbuster
it's proof that President Trump is an
insurrectionist because there's an email
and if what email Isn't Enough
there were three
three emails
there were three meals
and president Trump is an
insurrectionist Blockbuster proof he's a
liar
you get it now right
my problem is that
the one email didn't seem connected to
the point
but having three of those emails that
are also not connected to the point
you're making I'm not seeing how that
bolsters the argument
is that because you're watching all the
fake news on Fox News
I call it photos
they don't even know it
and scene
I believe
that's what's going on here spitting
 into gold over on CNN
all right let me tell you a story that
proves the simulation exists was there
was there a topic you were expecting me
to talk about this morning
was there uh something that happened
yesterday that you're thinking about
Scott's going to mention that today
anything
well let me tell you a little story in
case you missed it
so yesterday I said to myself man I am
so over stimulated
like that you know talking about the
news I did two live streams yesterday
and my head was just full of stuff and
yeah I had you know several issues I had
to work out and had a whole bunch of
scheduling things and
I just said to myself I'm going to take
a day off of Twitter
so after I did my morning stuff I
thought I'm going to go for a long walk
and for the first time and I don't
remember how long I'm just gonna not
check Twitter
for maybe the rest of the night very
unusual I I can't even think of a time
I've ever done that and as I was walking
I was feeling great because the once the
stimulation was behind me I was just
outdoors in the quiet
so I'm taking a nice walk to clear my
mind
and I had this distinct feeling which
I've had before
that I was in the simulation
and that I was an avatar
and that I was being watched
by perhaps the creator of the simulation
or the the game player or whatever
whatever was happening
and so
I talked out loud
to the creators of the simulation
and I said this is actually true by the
way everything I tell you is true all
right I swear I wouldn't make this up
and I'll tell you
I'm never going to lie to you if I tell
you I'm telling you the truth like if I
say directly you don't have to worry
about it like this is real
so I said to my I actually talk that
loud
and I said
um if this is a simulation
I need some evidence
and and I said specifically
if it's really a simulation I'm going to
need to show that I can author it in
other words I can make something happen
that only the simulation could explain
so that actually happened yesterday in
the afternoon
and I stayed off Twitter for a few hours
and I was feeling good about it and I
got a text
that directed me
to look at Twitter
how many times has that ever happened to
me
almost never right
almost never do I get a text
telling me to look at Twitter
because usually I'm on Twitter so I've
already seen it somebody would just DM
me on Twitter or something
and so I looked at the message and it
was a message that Elon Musk
had added in in the
in the string of tweets about Elizabeth
Warren where he was calling her Senator
Karen we're all having a good laugh
about that yesterday
somebody asked him uh something about uh
I don't know me or Dilbert and Elon Musk
tweeted this
he said I love Dilbert exclamation mark
you use it all the time to illustrate
that we're doing something wrong at
Tesla SpaceX
if it could be a Dilbert cartoon in real
life uh this happens more often than I'd
like Psy
now
of course when the richest person you
know tweets tweets something about you
in this case about Dilbert a lot of
people notice it and called it out to me
now you are aware
that the most the the person most famous
for promoting the idea that we live in a
simulation is Elon Musk right
like he's never tweeted at me before
and the one day that I'm waiting for a
sign that we live in the simulation Elon
Musk tweets at me
now that by itself wouldn't be the
biggest coincidence in the world right I
mean coincidence has happened
but it gets better uh a Twitter user uh
pranay pot Bethel patol
um I hope I'm pronouncing that somewhere
close to the name he tweets this at Elon
he says do you sometimes feel like
you're living in a Dilbert cartoon
simulation
Elon tweets back
yeah exclamation mark
so the person most famous
for saying we live in a simulation
is tweeting in front of the world that
he feels like he's living in a
simulation that I created
oh this is really ha this has really
happened
I'm not making enough any of this this
actually happened
so after I saw uh elon's tweet and I
think it was like I don't know some it
was in the middle of the morning which
you call the night those of you who like
to sleep in you call it night
but I think people like Elon Musk and
and people like me who hate sleep we
call that the morning
I think I got up this morning at
12 30.
a little earlier than usual
uh so I was up tweeting and stuff and
working
and so I tweeted back at Elon
um when he said that he does feel like
he lives in a Dilbert cartoon simulation
I tweeted this back I said too soon you
weren't scheduled to become self-aware
until after I finished drawing the Mars
colony
so that's out there now
um
I don't even know what to say about this
story
you know this is one of those stories
where you just put it out there and and
you just have to sort of
accept that it really happened
so that was pretty weird anyway
um
that was a favorite story of the day so
there's a uh a graph on
Twitter
now if it's a graph and it's on Twitter
what do you know about it
let's see it's it's information about uh
the pandemic and it's a graph and it's
on Twitter
so therefore it's
therefore it's totally true right
because it's a graph
I don't know if I mentioned it's on
Twitter
but it's not just a graph it's a graph
on Twitter
so that's completely credible
um and this graph was something I'd been
wanting to see for a long time which is
the difference in the death rates from
covid between Republicans and Democrats
and somebody found a way to do that
actually which was to use the voting
records of different counties as the
proxy and then look at the infection
rates on those counties versus you know
Bluer counties Etc
and it showed that most recently the
Republican line of Cova deaths is way
above way above the Democrats
what's that tell you
what does that tell you
um did I mention that it's a graph
but it's not just the graph it's on
Twitter
so I hope you're not doubting The
credibility of it
what
oh my God you're so skeptical
did I tell you it's a graph and it's on
Twitter
I mean if you hear those two things we
should be done here
that is a fact my friends even Snopes
will tell you
they just give up if they see it's a
graph on Twitter oh that's true
it's probably true it's a graph it's on
Twitter
well here are a few things that might be
wrong with that graph on Twitter number
one
if you monkey with the y-axis you can
make small differences look like really
big ones
do you remember the uh the Democrats
telling us that the gas prices have
dropped precipitously
well if you monkey with the y-axis it
looks like that two cents you know only
went down I guess a dime so far so uh
you can make anything look bigger so
that's the first thing you need to know
second thing you need to know is they
didn't adjust for age
there's no adjustment for age
and uh at least in one state I saw some
data I think it was Texas but let's say
this isn't too far from the rest of the
world the Republican voters are close to
eight years older on average than
Democrat voters
would eight years if that were the only
difference eight years of difference
would that explain
a substantial difference in outcomes
well eight years wouldn't be the biggest
difference would it
you know 20 years would be pretty
noticeable for sure but eight years
would be a smaller difference you would
predict
but you could make that look pretty big
couldn't you just adjust the y-axis
until it looks big
how about
how about weight we know that weight is
a comorbidity somebody said nine out of
ten of their red states are you know the
the fattest in the country
um
if the only thing you were measuring was
how people did by weight
would that graph look exactly the same
it might especially if you play with the
y-axis right so
um
I would love to see and then I asked in
response to that tweet I asked I'd like
to see the same graph except by race
suppose they did the same thing except
by race and do it the same way you know
use representative voting clusters or
something or just I guess census data so
to find out if the the areas with the
most black population have higher
infections or lower now what what do you
expect they would find
now if if I'm right about this and I
believe you get kicked off of Twitter if
you say this wrong
so if I say something that's not true
here my understanding is that I could
get kicked off of Twitter
or or blocked or something
and one of the things that I think is uh
not allowed is to suggest that any
ethnic groups have a different outcome
which I don't entirely understand
because I need a fact check on this but
my understanding is that it was
mainstream understanding that there was
a different outcome and that black
Americans were having a worse time of it
I thought that was just well understood
but give me a fact Jack so I have to act
like I don't know that's true or else
I'll get bumped off of Twitter I think
according to the guidelines if I
understand them right
so
what would happen if you saw two graphs
uh hypothetically there are graphs on
Twitter they're both graphs and on
Twitter one of them is just the one you
saw the Republicans versus Democrats
showing that Republicans have worse
outcomes according to that graph that's
a graph on Twitter so you know it's very
very credible
um but suppose you did that side by side
with one by uh race
is specifically compared just black and
white
um just to keep it simple and suppose it
showed a similarly appalling difference
like an alarming difference in outcome
where the black Americans were dying at
you know twice the rate or something
how would the news interpret those two
outcomes well let me tell you they would
look at the Republicans versus Democrat
and they'd say well that's proof that
Republicans are stupid
because they're not getting the vaccine
this would be the Democrat spin right
well though those Republicans are dying
because they're not getting the
vaccination because they're anti-science
right that's how the Democrats would
spin it how would they spend the one
that showed that the black Americans are
less vaccinated than white Americans
they would spin that as
less access
though it's been that as racism
why is it so racist that we can't get
more vaccinations to Black Americans
right those two things would would just
be interpreted completely differently I
don't know that either of them would be
right but you know that that's the way
it would look
all right that
is all the excitement that I had planned
for today
I believe there was I feel like there
was one other thing that was happening
that I'm forgetting about is there
anything else happening
um
spot on today thank you
please review REM deserveer why don't we
know it doesn't work is there anything
to review about REM deserve where they
thought it might work it doesn't right
isn't that the whole story
all right
um
how many of you think Ivermectin uh
works against covid
and how many of you have heard the
um the hypothesis
from pretty smart people that it may
look like it worked because of a
combination of some large studies that
were actually fraudulent or didn't exist
Plus
the experience with countries where they
had some internal worms
so I guess if you've got a parasite in
your stomach and you've got coveted
you're more likely to die
so the people who took the Ivermectin
probably were getting rid of a
comorbidity if that's the right word for
it instead of getting rid of the virus
but that would give you the same
Improvement in life expectancy
so how many of you knew that that there
is there is an explanation of why it
would appear that Ivermectin works well
it doesn't
now I'm not saying it doesn't I'm saying
that's the official the official take on
it right now how many of you are aware
of that so I'm just checking your bubble
uh in the comments how many of you had
heard
that Ivermectin might look like it works
and that those are the reasons a couple
of big fake studies that are skewing the
rest
along with uh the aromectom cleaning up
the comorbidity of of the parasites in
the stomachs
seeing a lot of no's
a lot of knows I only heard this a few
days ago
so I think Scott Alexander apparently
was talking about it
um
and I I tend to listen to him he's one
of the smartest people on the internet
um
so it must be true well I'm not saying I
know it's true
I'm saying that now we have a a pretty
reasonable sounding hypothesis for why
it could look like it's working or not
because here's the thing the longer we
go
without even one city or municipality
completely getting rid of covet with
either hydroxychloroquine with some
other stuff or with Ivermectin the
longer we go without even one example of
a city a county somebody just squashing
it
uh the odds of it really being effective
against covet specifically
are pretty low
um I would say I'd put the odds of both
of them at 10 percent
I wouldn't go to zero I could be
surprised but I'd say the odds that
either hydroxychloroquine or in any
confrontation with anything else or
Ivermectin
works against coronavirus I started down
at
well over 50 percent when when we were
first hearing about it when I heard that
there were lots of studies and that the
meta-analysis would look at make it look
good I said you know
I don't really trust meta-analysis but I
give it a 50 chance certainly enough
that I would have tried it you know if
if I'd uh if I'd gotten covered when Joe
Rogan got covered oh I'd take the
Ivermectin
that was the right risk management
decision I think his doctor advised him
correctly that doesn't mean it worked
but it was the right decision
you know from the perspective of Looking
Back Now
if it happened to be today
and I'd heard this stuff about well it
doesn't it doesn't look like the
indications of it working are true
would I take it today
if there's only a uh if there's only a
10 chance
there's still almost zero side effects
right
so if there's almost zero side effects
and 10 chance it might work
and I'm not saying it would work 10
percent like it work a little bit I'm
not saying that I'm saying there's only
a 10 chance it has any effect
that you'd notice
I don't know that'd be a toss-up you
know at 10 percent
I guess maybe if my doctor said so I'd
probably try it
just because there's no downside
uh but I wouldn't I wouldn't be counting
on it that's for sure I definitely
wouldn't be putting the regener on off
oh by the way an update on my friend who
had a bad turn with covid
uh he uh he was denied regeneron until
about 10 days into it because there was
some guideline about when you can give
it early and when you can't uh but they
bent the rules
and he got the regeneron
and I don't know if it was a regeneron
that regenerated him but that was about
the turning point and and now he's uh
he's on the mend
you know got a little uh lingering
little lingering symptoms but I think
the virus is cleared
yeah that was regenerate
all right um
uh what about hydroxychloroquine was
there any research with zinc well I'm I
am aware we talked to this extensively
in the beginning that it looked like the
studies were intentionally done to fail
would you agree with that
and you can imagine if you were a big
vaccine company you didn't want these
things to succeed you would actually
fund tests that you knew would fail
so you'd look for somebody who had a
test structure that by its nature it was
going to show it didn't work and you
would fund that one
that's what I'd do if I were if I were a
dirty trickster you know Pharma big
Pharma company that's what I do now if
you're wondering would big Pharma do a
horrible horrible thing you have to
watch the special dope sick about the
Sackler family and Purdue and oxycontin
if you think there's anything they
wouldn't do
there's nothing they wouldn't do they
meaning there's somebody in that
universe that would do almost anything
right
so
that doesn't mean it happened I'll tell
you my current best opinion about the
vaccinations you ready
um so this is a modified sort of
evolving opinion my current best opinion
and there seemed to be you know a binary
going on here one one that the risks of
the vaccines are not worth it and the
other is that the risks are low compared
to the covet itself so they're not just
worth it they're really really worth it
so the binary is it's worthless or it's
or it's pretty great even though it's
not a true vaccine it still has many
benefits
here's my take
I think it might be the most dangerous
vaccine we've ever had
but I think the people who did the
science probably thought it worked
that's what I think I think the the
actual scientists who did the studies
for these big companies I think they
believed it worked meaning that the
benefit was far greater than the risk I
do think they may have
they may have underplayed the risks
is there anybody who would disagree with
that that the Pharma companies would or
have underplayed the risk
what do you think I think I think that
could be almost certainly true because
that would be every company acting
exactly like every company X it's almost
it's not even an indictment of the
Pharma industry that would just be a
statement of what companies do they
minimize their problems and they
exaggerate their benefits it does I
don't think it could be that different
with Pharma they must be exaggerating
their benefits and hiding to some extent
you know there's a limit Beyond which it
becomes purely Criminal
here's what I I don't think happened
I don't think
that anybody was involved in a
money-making big Pharma scheme
that could be easily detected later
that part is a stretch for me although
people do crazy stuff so they do things
that are not good for themselves but it
would be unlikely
um generally speaking when somebody does
something underhanded when there are
shenanigans
they at least do things that they think
they can get away with would you agree
with the premise
that at least if you're talking about
not career criminals who can do some
crazy stuff but I'm talking about
you know people who wear uh science
jackets and neckties
that group of people you know the
educated segment of the society if
they're going to do something that's a
huge crime
they're going to try pretty hard to make
sure nobody ever finds out right that's
sort of that's sort of important in the
crime
you don't steal a bunch of stuff that
you know you're going to get caught at
you don't murder somebody on video right
you at the very least you're going to
try pretty hard
not to do a crime that you know you're
going to get caught for
now
suppose a bunch of the people at one of
these big Pharma companies
knew and I don't think this is the case
but hypothetically suppose they knew
that the vaccines were worse than the
covet itself
or at least you know not that much
better
do you think that they could have made
their billions of dollars because even
the employees are making you know bank
with their 401ks and everything so
everybody at the big Pharma companies
are making a lot of money that's for
sure you know even the lower employee
level
uh because of stock
so
do you think
that there was somebody who would do
that kind of crime
with the odds of detection being I think
close to 100 percent
if you wait long enough now they might
not get caught this year
hypothetically if anything underhand had
happened or maybe not next year but what
are the odds that they could go five
years without somebody uncovering
the crime
I don't think so
I feel like there would be too many too
many people involved too many potential
whistleblowers too many people looking
at the same data with different you know
different ways in
I feel like you would know for sure you
couldn't get away with that
so I don't think anybody would steal a
billion dollars if they knew they were
going to get caught
a lot of people would steal a billion
dollars if they thought there was a good
chance of not getting caught you know
you'd find lots of volunteers for that
but if you knew you were going to get
caught
and I think they would have to know that
if they literally faked the data that's
going to bite them in the ass
and so I say
if it if we ever find out that anybody
in the you know vaccine universe
uh did something literally illegal
to make it look like it was safer than
it was that's got to be the death
penalty
would you agree
that now some of you just may disagree
with the death penalty on principle
that's a different question but in terms
of the maximum penalty that the United
States gives to anybody what would be
bigger than that
I think it would be criminal in itself
to be executing you know low-income
people who've done you know equally
heinous things or actually not even
close there's probably nobody on death
row who's done anything close to that in
terms of body count if it happened right
and my my guess is that it didn't happen
so if you want a prediction that you can
take you know you can hold me to
here's my prediction
that nobody did a crime
that will be easily detectable there
could be crime
in fact almost certainly
the odds that all of these big Pharma
companies did everything legally and
there was no employee who broke a crime
or broke a law in some way zero I mean
you know big companies sometimes
you know the Lacross some lines to get
things done so definitely there was some
Shenanigans but my personal opinion is
we won't find
the the hidden like obvious
fraud that somebody did to make a
billion dollars
um
because nobody does that crime
now
I say nobody like it's an absolute but
it's never an absolute so if I give you
a prediction you should just in your
mind you should say that's not 100
because nothing is
but I'd say the odds are not going to go
uh 80 percent
I'll give you an 80 chance that no
matter how good or bad the vaccines are
in reality
that there won't be somebody that you
find just hid the bad data to make a
bunch of money
because they would definitely go to jail
for that
and by the way I'm not even sure if they
could live a life in the in the United
States you know even if they didn't go
to jail for it if somehow they got off
on it I don't even know if they can live
in the United States because they would
be responsible for you know countless
deaths and under the scenario would have
known about it would have known they did
it
yeah so when you see the 75 year thing
you have to assume criminal activity
don't you
I mean seriously if a company says we'll
show you our data in 75 years you should
just shut them down
you should just take that as proof of
Criminal Intent you don't even know what
the crime is you say um I don't even
know what the crime is but you're
committing one
like if there could be a clear
indication of a crime
I've never heard of one
so I think is just the fact that they
asked for the 75 years I mean I'm joking
but I feel like you should shut them
down for that
you just shut down the whole vaccination
basically I would have withdrawn the
vaccination at that point
let me say it directly
if Pfizer or whoever
requires 55 years or 75 I think they're
still negotiating some of that but if
they require that and there's no
explanation for why that makes sense
I think you have to withdraw the vaccine
don't you
I mean I think that's a that's a
no-brainer now now you want to get mad
this will be easy watch me trigger you
as obvious as that is to you and to me
which one of our politicians is even
suggesting that
right
did you hear any Republicans suggested I
didn't
hear any Democrats suggested I didn't
no and let me tell you that unless
there's more to the story and there
might be it could be that if you listen
to Pfizer's side they would give you
some reason that you'd never even
thought of it's like oh God yeah that
would take 75 years I can't I can't
imagine what that would be
but I think until we hear that in other
words oh Rand Paul
did Rand Paul say that directly
that because of the 75 years that's the
reason enough to withdraw the vaccine to
me that's reason enough and not only is
it reason enough
is more than reason enough
I mean that's that's beyond the best
reason anybody ever gave for anything
right can you think of anything that
anybody's ever done in any domain there
would be a better reason
than pulling vaccinations when the
company won't give you data about their
safety
no no no there's nothing more obvious
and easy to make than that decision
assuming that you have enough of the
other vaccinations
now some of it might be that
you know if you don't have it fewer
people will get vaccinated so maybe some
calculation there
uh is it Pfizer or the FDA that's
withholding the data now either way
it doesn't matter if the data is being
withheld from the public and from the
rest of the scientific community
it doesn't matter who's withholding it
you still have to pull the vaccination
and by the way are is our government
even talking about it except for Rand
Paul
I mean Biden should be saying out loud
well we've got a problem with Pfizer
I think I think Trump would do that
wouldn't he
can you imagine Trump in the same
situation
where Pfizer told them they couldn't
give the data for X years don't you
think Pfizer would tell them are we
going to pull the we're going to pull
your approval
the most obvious thing in the world I
think you would say okay you've got a
week and then we're going to pull your
emergency approval it's the most obvious
play what's going on now keep in mind
this might be a news problem it could be
that the news is serving us so poorly
that we don't even understand this issue
about the documents in the 75 years
because there's something about it we
don't understand I I have trouble
believing it says
cut and dried as they're hiding data
from us it was it really that's it is
that the whole story they are
intentionally hiding data from us until
they die I mean if that is the whole
story
than the the management of it is just
moronically simple you pull you pull the
authorization you have to
I mean how how could the public have any
confidence in this government if they
don't pull the authorization or
or just as happy
or explain explain the reasoning in a
way that makes sense there might be an
explanation
in fact I would say there's at least a
50 chance there's some reason that we
don't even understand it could be that
it takes you know years to produce uh
new data that goes in these documents
something like that I mean if you
consider that almost every other story
we hear is fake in some way
fake uh it's hard to believe this one's
the one that's clean
privacy issues or something
oh that's interesting
privacy issues I don't see any way that
you couldn't remove identities
that doesn't sound real
um
redactions take time well if they're
redacting things I got questions
um
is the FDA is asking for 75 years to
clear out patient data
meaning that we would remove the way to
identify which patient it is
so are we waiting for the patients
involved to die of natural causes
um let me just say that isn't a good
enough reason
like I hear it as a reason but I want to
invite Dale back because it's not
connecting with the problem
I don't see how you can't remove
identifying information
unless that's the only maybe it is the
identified identities of the people
that's the only thing that'll take 75
years I mean if that's the case then
it's irrelevant isn't it
so I'm going to keep my 50 odds that
there's nothing to this story
how do you like that 50 odds that
there's actually nothing to the story
and that the thing that's being withheld
wasn't anything that anybody needed
anyway you know such as the actual
identity identities of the people
all right but I'll but I'll keep with
that if we don't have a good explanation
from the government
we can't live with that all right
um that is all I have to talk about
today
I think you'll agree this is the best
live stream that's ever happened in the
history of the United States possibly
the entire world maybe the rest of the
solar system and
could be the universe
Scott benby you were Shilling if you
believe 50 will do Ken you're banned
oh I'd use her on this channel
yes if you think that you can detect
Shilling by my by my opinions
well you're not smart enough to be on
this live stream
goodbye Ken
um
get a band hammer
what time do you go to bed well
last night
10 P.M
and I woke up two and a half hours later
and I said to myself you know
I'm tired of sleeping
so I just got up
um one of the things that I teach you
when I when I do my micro lessons I I
think one of them is on sleep
one of these sleep tricks is if you
can't get back to sleep don't try
you know you could try for a little
while but if you know it's not going to
happen you get up
and then tonight I'll go to bed at 10
o'clock and I'm going to be exhausted
and tonight I'll get back on track but
don't don't stay up torturing yourself
just get up and do something you wanted
to do anyway clean the house do some
work you know take a walk
just get up and do something that's what
I've been doing for years and I I enjoy
it quite a bit
Scott's writing the coattails of Dale's
Fame well that's one way to do it
um
all right
uh somebody says all Indians have worms
it's a fallacy well I don't think
anybody was claiming all Indians have
worms I I think that there may have been
enough people in some areas
that it could show up in the data that's
a that's a big distance from all Indians
have worms
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you
Jimmy Dore and RFK Jr last night was
better
was it
uh
did uh did they tell you uh in a way
that you can summarize
well uh RFK said
because because here's the test if you
can summarize it
like you know direct sentence somebody
did this and caused this then maybe
there's something to it
but if you can summarize it
might not be anything there
anyway that's the test and I'll talk to
you tomorrow
