good morning everybody and welcome to
another highlight
of your entire life
now we're not going to count the
afterlife which
for all we know could be awesome for you
well maybe not all of you if you know
what i mean i think you do
but for many of you this will be the
highlight of your biological life before
you become a digital entity or possibly
pass into the afterlife and become pure
energy
but until that happens you're going to
need a little extra energy from the
outside maybe a little uh
yeah you know i'm going with this don't
you and all you need is a copper mug or
a glass up tanker jealous or stein a
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
the thing makes everything better
the thing that makes your day
spectacular
it's going to happen now it's called the
simultaneous tip go
well
i hope you enjoyed this because it might
be our last day together
um
i'm looking to cause some trouble
and
we'll see if that works out for me
but we'll get to that
so some researchers have found the
optimum amount of sleep
for seniors
which is a complete waste of time i
think because
senior citizens could just sleep all day
if they want
they don't have to do anything
so i'm looking forward to that phase of
life
uh you can sleep all you want actually i
don't like sleep so i'm a terrible
person to advise you about it
but i do put a lot of work
into doing the
mechanisms of sleep right you know i go
to go to bed at a good time always get
up at the same time no matter the day
don't watch tv
you know don't think don't do things
that activate my brain
don't think about the next day when i'm
asleep never think about the next day
and never think about the last day
actually those are the two things you
should never think about when you're
trying to get to sleep don't think about
anything that's happened
at all
that'll just drive you nuts you'll never
sleep if you're thinking about something
that happened
and never think about
something that you're expecting
something that you're worried about so
don't think about yourself in the past
or your real self in the future
instead
think about your imaginary self in the
future
imaginary self in the future now you're
still you
but in the future you're having a good
day
just doing something
going to the beach
being successful
you know maybe you lost that weight you
want to lose you're you're having
amazing physical relationships
with that beautiful person
so use that time just to think about
good things that could happen to you
that's my sleeping tip
and it turns out that they say that you
need about seven hours if you're a
senior
but of course this is very individual so
there's a big individual difference
i'm pretty sure
that i need less sleep than other people
or i could be fooling myself
and
i just don't like sleep
because i really hate it i hate sleep
i feel like it's like being dead
before you have to be
i don't want to be dead before i have to
be
um
and i find sleep physically
uncomfortable
like i can't stay in a bed
for like hours are you kidding me
it's just so physically uncomfortable
i'm just like oh i need to like stand up
or stretch or something i don't know how
people do it
how you sleep eight hours i can't even
imagine so there's a big individual
difference
all right well i think i might get
canceled this week
i introduced the new character and
dilbert
started running today
and it features a character called dave
and um you won't be able to see it too
well
but i need to show you the visual
so you can see that dave is a black
character he's going to be a regular in
dilbert
well i'll see how he goes
he'll be a regular if he's well received
and here's the setup so it's just the
dilbert cast
sitting around the table as they often
do
and
dave the new engineer who if you were to
look at the picture
you'd say to yourself
i don't know
but dave looks like he might be black
based on the just based on the physical
appearance
and the boss says
management asked me to add some
diversity to the engineering team
and then he says meet dave
and then he points to dave and
dave says i identify as
and white
boss looks at dave and he says you're
ruining everything dave
and
i figured
the best thing i could do
the best thing i could do is uh
play with the the way people feel about
the topic
so this is going to be way less about
dave
and way more about the topic
one of the uh so i've been watching to
see what kind of criticism i get
and
one of the criticisms was i think from
somebody who was probably white based on
the way
i'm just guessing
but the comment was it looks like i
designed the character
without having ever met an actual black
person
to which i said
well that's kind of racist
are you assuming that if i'd met
lots of black people i would have come
to the conclusion they're all the same
is that what you're suggesting
is there some reason that this
particular
one individual in a world full of
individuals can't just be his own person
so
you see how double-edged all of this is
even the critics are racist
because as soon as you say hey that that
one black character isn't acting like a
black person acts i have to say
well how does a black person act
what exactly do you mean by that anyway
why can't why can't every person be
individual
so it does kind of challenge you uh
for uh you know what what do you think
you can get away with and all that
now
there's some back story
the back story is that for decades
literally i've wanted to add more
diversity to the dilbert cast
for all the normal reasons
the you know the customers would like it
better right the people reading it would
say oh that looks more like
the real world and there's somebody i
can relate to and all that stuff
so of course i've always wanted to add
diversity but
it's it's such a third rail
because if you happen to be one kind of
person
by your writing dialogue for another
kind of person especially if there's a
physicality to it like a comic
you you just assumed to be
some kind of a racist or sexist right
there's just no way to get around it
so the
the the clever side door that i'm trying
to kick open and i don't know if i'll do
it yet right but this is the attempt
is to get in through the silliness side
door
so rather than rather than take the
issues
you know the real issues
head on i'm just going to take how
people feel about being in the world
where they have to take on these issues
because to me the the smaller you go
the funnier it is
right the big picture is
systemic racism the legacy of slavery
uh maybe reparations like those are
big issues but they're not funny
right
you know you can't really make
a joke out of some stuff
like even if you thought it was funny it
wouldn't be a good commercial
approach
um so instead i'll take it from the the
big stuff that scares us down to the
little stuff of how do you navigate this
world
like if you're just if you're just
trying to
you're just trying to get through the
day like how do you navigate all this so
that's where i'm at i'm on the
navigation level
so it'll be a full week of uh dave the
the new engineer
and uh you will see what his character
flaw is
it will be revealed
if we can call it that
so all characters in in the comic world
all characters have to have a comic i
have to have a flaw
so that was the hard part well you'll
see how i uh
how i handled that
uh by according to rasmussen new poll
biden's approval is slightly ticking up
ticking up it's up to
job approval up to 42 percent
which matches trump's lowest level
now this is biden is
has improved to trump's lowest ever
so
uh am i wrong with my prediction that
trump would look better every day that
he was out of office
so far that's one of my best predictions
because i don't think anybody thought
that was going to happen like even his
supporters i don't think he thought that
that was going to happen
uh maybe you did maybe you're smart
well
and here bill maher basically
agreeing that trump is right so here's
some of the things that bill maher said
when is biden going to understand that
immigration is a big deal
you know you can't get any more clearer
than that
that uh the biden is is just not keen
now to be fair
to be fair
uh bill maher also said that immigration
is to the democrats
what health care is to republicans
the republicans act like
it's not that important you don't have
to do anything about it on health care
now that would be an interpretation i'm
not saying that literally
and then likewise republicans would say
of democrats
that they don't have any plan for the
border and they're not taking it
seriously
again that would be
an interpretation not my personal view
so um
the the larger story here
is that there there's a class of people
who are just breaking free
from the narratives
and bill maher would be you know one of
the top ones so you got your joe rogans
and your elon musks and your other folks
but more and more people are just saying
you know
what if
what if i didn't agree with everything
my team says can i get away with that
bill maher also said
and
let's say he was joking when he said
this when i see young people walk
walking alone outside with the mask i
want to punch them
he said on friday
now of course he didn't really want to
punch them
but
yeah it's just amazing to see how
how full-throatedly he's embracing a lot
of the things that are just purely you
imagine are purely republican views but
it shouldn't be
because they're they're pretty just
universally reasonable things to think
so
here's the least surprising story of the
day
amber heard fired her
pr team
what
are you telling me amber heard had a
she actually hired somebody and paid
them
to prove her publicity
now
i don't always agree with everybody who
gets fired you know i don't agree they
deserve to get fired all the time but
if i were uh
amber heard's pr team
i think i would have seen this coming i
would have seen this coming
you sort of you wonder how that meeting
went don't you
how'd that meeting go
did amber
heard call in her team and say
you know i hired you to make me look
good
you got that right that was your job
your job was to make me look good
and they say yes we understand that
and she said you know what's trending on
twitter today don't you
and they would probably say i don't know
we don't use twitter i'm just guessing i
don't know if they do or not but
and then
she'd say
amber turd
it's actually replaced my real name
and then they'd say
well
but at least
your version of the story is getting out
and then she say
not so much um so far it looks like i'm
a monster
and my name is amber turd
and i'm the worst monster in the world
well yes sure
but at least we're making johnny depp
look bad too
no
do you know what johnny depp's nickname
is
johnny depp
and again let me reiterate
what is trending on
twitter and my new nickname is amber
turd
johnny depp
still johnny depp
amber heard
now i am returned
you're not doing your job
[Music]
yeah it turns out that uh
johnny depp has become kind of a hero
and i don't believe he's got a prt
maybe he does do you think he does
i've got a feeling that what johnny depp
has
is bigger balls than we imagined
and
he's just done
and i think he's done going with the
narrative
i believe
he's walked right out
of the scenery
just like bill maher
johnny depp has escaped the narrative
you know what the narrative is
it's always the manner of the bad ones
and johnny depp
didn't want that narrative
he walked right out
it's going to cost him a ton of
money
he apparently he just decided
he was going to do it
remember the bill maher story
remember the johnny depp story
it's all going to come together toward
the end
in a soup of deliciousness that you
could never have imagined when you
started watching
yeah that's where things are going
it's all cleverly crafted
well let's cook up some more
in no particular order
um
have you ever heard of this thing called
projection it's a thing that people with
certain personality characteristics have
um
and this would be the ember herd problem
because i'm guessing
we don't know
but i'm guessing that amber heard's uh
blaming the bad publicity that she's
getting recently on her pr team
that would be projection
um she's not blaming the fact
that she put a turd on johnny depp's bed
and then accused him of being an abuser
while she was abusing him allegedly
so no that's not the problem the problem
is a bad pr team
am i right
so that's projection
she she makes her problem with somebody
else's problem
um let's talk about uh
will buchen and
glaxo klein smith
so glaxo klein smith is paying some
massive multi-billion dollar fines for
bad behavior big pharma company
and the united states has alleged that
between
99 and
2003
that the company promoted this drug
called welbucian
approved at the time only for major
depressive disorders
i guess they promoted it for everything
from weight loss to treatment of sexual
dysfunction
substance addiction and attention
deficit hyper
activity disorder among other off-label
uses
now
there's nothing wrong with off-label use
that's not the problem
so that's that's legal and appropriate
in many cases
but apparently they paid doctors uh
millions of dollars
and you know gave took them to lavish
resorts
to
push the off-label uses
those are unapproved uses
now
apparently and and
and there was also some misbranding
offenses
now
does anybody know anybody who's used
will butcher
you know i only know two examples of it
in my whole life and they were both
disasters
you know but that's anecdotal so two
examples and both both were really
disasters in my opinion
now that's not a medical opinion because
i'm not a doctor and it's just anecdotal
but i'm looking at the comments
and look at all the people who've had
similar experiences there's somebody
they know
you know a lot of yes's are going by
a lot of people who just
had bad experience with it
now here's my problem if you make a drug
and you're you mean well and you're
doing everything right but it doesn't
work out and people get hurt
that's bad
that's bad we don't want that but it's
not evil and it's not criminal
and you know it's unfortunately
something that's just going to happen
but if you're doing some of this stuff
intentionally
and you know i'm not entirely clear who
did what intentionally in this but this
is really bad this is really evil
and
i feel as if
because i
do a comic strip that makes fun of
big companies the dilbers company is
going to have to move into the pharma
space
until now he was just a tech guy
but i feel like dilbert's company needs
to move into the big form of space are
you with me
you want to have some fun
because
because i don't feel that big pharma has
the attention it deserves
so
uh coming soon
the dilbert's company will be moving
into that space
i got a suggestion that uh one of the
characters
in this scenario should be called
pilbert
that's right pilbert
because what's better than a product
with off-label use
am i right
you can buy this printer we make it for
printing things on paper
but the off-label use
is
murderer
because you can get people over the head
with
all right
there's a
saw a tweet by jack hunter
and he said the following he said elon
musk joe rogan dave chappelle glenn
greenwald and bill maher
all of them are high profile and
bulletproof
defenders of free speech and basic
liberalism right now during a time when
it's so desperately needed
i thought to myself
huh
yeah
we're actually seeing something like
that aren't we we're seeing a bunch of
um well unfortunately it's all men
i suppose that's not ideal
and uh except for dave chappelle a bunch
of white men
so you know maybe maybe that's not the
branding you want but the point is that
there are some people who are willing to
um
say what they want to say those people
have free speech
now wouldn't it be great if non-rich
people had free speech too
wouldn't that be great
um
well it would be
and i was thinking about
what is really driving this behavior
because there's something happening
and it's some kind of a massive um
transfer of power
it wasn't long ago the experts and the
press
and the politicians
pretty much had a monopoly on power and
the rich i suppose
and
it seems to be moving toward a group of
independent people who are willing to
say what's true
or what's helpful
rather than what the narrative is
they're basically people escaping the
narrative at a very high level
and they're the ones that are starting
to draw a attention
now this is related to
well let me give you an example first
i i've always been amazed at the
founders of america you know the the
so-called founding fathers but let's
call them founders
to be less sexist
i always thought were the founders
unusually brave
or what was going on there because they
knew that if it didn't work they would
be dead and it really on paper it didn't
look like something that would work the
revolution
that is right the revolution didn't
really look like a high
a high percentage play did it
so why did all these people who were
sort of in the best situations
why were so many of them willing to die
to create america
and i have a theory and the theory goes
like this
that we have normal risk management
decision making
for normal situations
but under at one unique situation
our risk management turns off
and that unique situation i've never
heard anybody talk about this before so
this is purely speculative see if it
makes sense
the one situation in which your risk
management just clicks off
is if it's a really big problem
and you're the only one who can fix it
now think about that this one has to
sink in a little bit
it's a really big problem
and you just have the bad luck of being
the only one who can fix it
i don't think bravery is what's doing it
i don't think so i think risk management
clicks off and i'm going to give you an
example of that
and i think that the founders of the
country
their normal risk management just turned
off
because they realized that they
alone were uniquely
uniquely situated
to create something amazing in terms of
freedom and you know the human
experience
and i think that something about their
capability
is what drove them
even more than maybe their normal risk
management decision making would
so
let me give you a story in which i felt
this effect all right so i'm gonna tell
you a story
where it's the first time i had this
experience of my own my risk management
clicking off
uh so years ago i was in my early
twenties moved to san francisco didn't
know anybody and i loved playing soccer
as a hobby
and so i was always looking for a way to
play soccer somebody mentioned oh they
always have a sunday pickup game in
golden gate park
so i thought well i'm gonna go there and
find that game and see if i can get in
on that
so i'd go there on sunday and i look
around and
i didn't see any soccer games
i saw lots of people walking around like
they thought there should be a soccer
game
i saw people
who
were dressed for soccer
but there was no soccer happening
and so i thought
maybe it was just like an off day or i
looked in the wrong field or something
so i made sure i knew where the field
was the right place
and i went back and i looked and same
thing there was just no soccer they were
just people who looked like they wanted
to play wandering around
then going home
so i did the same thing
the next time i went
i brought a soccer ball
problem solved
problem solved
turns out that nobody had a soccer ball
so i bring a soccer ball and this
this whole united nations group of
people from
you know some of the people from uh we
had
egypt peru
south korea
you know a bunch of african countries
europeans of every day
so we had basically south americans
mexicans so we had every kind of person
who just
bonded over
soccer now because i had the ball
and i spoke english
which was the thing that if they a lot
of them didn't speak english or only a
little bit but it was the closest thing
to a common language
and i had the ball
and so i felt oh damn it
i guess i'm in charge
now i didn't want to be in charge
because i didn't necessarily want to do
the extra work of being in charge and
everybody hates the person in charge
because you're always doing something
wrong according to somebody but
nobody else could do it
for whatever reason i was it was just i
was the one who had to do it
so i i would say okay you and you are
captains pick teams
and the two people would just look
around and they'd think
okay
it was also one of my early lessons
that people want to be told what to do
leadership is the easiest thing in the
world
you just have to understand that people
would rather be led than make decisions
on their own
once you know that
if you're willing to do the work
to make the decision people will just do
whatever you want
so so whenever i encounter a big group
of confused people
i just start telling them what to do
i'll go into stores sometimes where the
the line situation isn't clear
like people are waiting for service but
it's not clear if the line is formed or
are there two lines for the same thing
or is it or is it one line
and i'll just go in there and start
shouting orders
i go all right everybody
what line do you think you're in do you
think you're in the same line everybody
think you're in one line all right some
of you think you're in two lines let's
take a vote you think you're one line or
two all right let's make it one line you
guys get over and people will just do
whatever you want
you just have to act like you you're
willing to take the risk right
all right so back to my soccer game
so it was a real diverse group of people
as i said and one day things got kind of
violent
no that's not true
every day things got kind of violent
pretty much pretty much every soccer
game there was violence
that's why we were there
okay let's be honest
the the the physicality of the game was
part of the attraction we were guys
we were youngish men
and
the violence is just part of the appeal
right you can't really sugarcoat that
but it's friendly violence right it's in
the context
but one day i got a control and two of
the players got in each other's faces it
looked like a fight could start
but the bigger of the two the more
dangerous scary one
uh he leaves suddenly and we're like off
you know we don't have to delay the game
there's not going to be a fight
but he comes back with a knife
and he gets into this guy's face who's
backing up of course with the knife and
he's telling him he's going to stab him
if he doesn't whatever
and for whatever reason he wasn't
satisfied that the guy was backing down
enough
so we're gonna have a knife fight and
it's gonna ruin my soccer game
now i look around and of course the the
action is happening and the rest of the
soccer players have sort of gathered
around
like in a circle and i'm looking at
everybody else
and i'm thinking
oh
you know where this is going right
i have to stop a knife fight
because i'm in charge
and nobody else is going to do it
that's it
that that's like the only calculation
and i'm thinking to myself
god damn it
like like there's nobody else who's
going to do this really
i have to literally stop a knife fight
so i did
you know i just got between them
and the guy with the knife you know
wasn't ready to kill me right away
because he didn't have a beef with me
but he very quickly
changed his direction to me
and started threatening me with a knife
and then a very interesting thing
happened
and this is one of the coolest things
that's ever happened to me in my life
now the first thing you need to know
is that i was neither afraid
nor brave
my risk management just turned off
because i was the only one who could do
that job
that's it
i was the only one who could do it
it needed to be done
and i don't remember thinking anything
about the risk i just remember doing it
and yeah and somebody's saying who's
stupid probably
um i don't know
and so
i told the guy that with a knife who was
threatening to kill me
that he needed to leave now
and he should never come back
and of course it was one of his favorite
things to do we all loved playing on
sunday it was just amazing fun
and he didn't want to do that so i
continued pushing my point and i told
him leave now
go now
never come back
he starts threatening me with a knife
again
now here was the fun part
remember i told you there's this crowd
of international
young men
who had all bonded
around this game
and in particular they had bonded with
me
because i brought the ball
again it was that easy
and so as he started threatening me
this group of
fairly rough
individuals from countries where
serious happens
and they probably escape from it to come
here
just started closing in
just a half a step
a little bit at a lot of time and it was
like this slow creeping
squeeze
where as he talked you could see him
looking around
and he'd have to look around and people
were just closing in
they didn't say anything
they didn't say anything
they just closed the space
and pretty soon the message was very
clear
that if he cut me
he would be
dead he would be dead
and nobody had to say a thing
it was just obvious
the the it was sort of
um now i'm not sure if the women
watching this can
appreciate it the way men can
but you know men live in a continuous
state of violence
we just don't talk about it all the time
we're the the threat of male violence is
permanent
it's it's what holds society together
and you have to understand that that's
like an important
foundational structure of everything
if men were not afraid of other men
killing them literally
nothing would work
nothing so
when men are in that situation it's
actually kind of
energizing
and it was just sort of a good
experience
so
it ended well i didn't get killed but
that was one you know people uh
and then he left and he never came back
so here's my point
was i a hero no
because there was no thought in my mind
of risk management i was just the one
who could do it
and i think that that's actually
genetically coded into us and i think it
has nothing to do with being male
has nothing to do with being physically
brave because i'm very much not
right i would not call myself physically
brave i don't do extreme sports you know
i don't do dangerous stuff
because
it just doesn't excite me
but sometimes you're just the only
person who can do a thing
so you do and i think that would have
appealed that would have been true of
men women
people of almost any age i think
so and that brings us to
the story of uh elon musk and his so his
quote shadow crew
i'm going to tie this all together it's
all good and tied together
so the wall street journal had a report
said that
that elon musk's decision to buy twitter
was perhaps
influenced by what they called a shadow
crew
of advisors i guess there were other
billionaires um you know people who were
involved with
paypal with them etc
and
um that's how they framed it so the
framing was that there were these other
voices informing him and maybe other
billionaires
maybe we should be concerned about who
these other
shadow crew is
what do you think of that
uh yeah and
jack dorsey was named as one of them
um
so what do you think of that word shadow
well it sounds ominous doesn't it
all right here here's another way to
frame the same story
instead of a
shadow crew of elites
sounds kind of ominous how about this
a hundred percent of the smartest people
that must knows advise them the same way
because i'll bet that's true
i'll bet 100 percent of the people above
a certain intelligence level
that personally knew musk enough to
advise him
i'll bet every one of them told him to
do the same thing
if you could buy this thing
do it
i'll bet every one of them
i i would be surprised if even one
person
above a certain level of intelligence
would have told them not to do this
because it's just too fun
it's too
it's to clean the solution
and it might be the only one
now this gets us back to
do you think that elon musk woke up and
wanted to buy twitter
do you think do you think he bought it
because this was on his list
i don't think so
i i think he was
he was just me at the soccer game
i think he was just the only one who
could do it
and i think that all the smart people in
the world said you know
this whole freedom of speech thing
this is
this is the the dna that holds the
country together
you can't mess with that
you you got to get you got to get the
basic health of the country right or
nothing else works
and i think the smartest people in the
world looked at each other and said
all right there's only one of us who's a
crazy who has enough money
elon you're up
[Laughter]
and and and you know you saw there was a
quote one time about uh his publicity i
guess it was a pure
uh consultant who once told elon to keep
a lower profile on the platform
and apparently musk
wrote an email back to him
quote we'll tweet as i wish and suffer
the consequences so it goes
so since 2018
he's been willing to die on the free
speech hill
probably knowing that he wouldn't die
but he had a special position in the
world
he could afford it
he could take the heat
he can turn a bad product or an
incomplete product into a better one
and he can he can he can handle the
criticism
he had all the tools
and i don't know did anybody else
is there anybody else who had those
tools
no
it had to be him
so
the
thinking of this is some kind of like
shadow crew to make it sound ominous is
a completely wrong frame the frame is
that there are a few people who have
left the scenery
there are just a few people who can get
out of the narrative
bill maher joe rogan elon musk glenn
greenwald
tulsi gabbard perhaps you could throw
lots of people in that list
and i think that what's happening is
that collectively they're all having the
same realization
that the people in charge can't get it
done
there are just some things
that people are looking at each other
and saying
i think we have to do it
and the people who advised
or maybe influence musk who knows if
they really did
but i think that they have the same
reaction
i think the reaction was probably oh
damn it
nobody else is fixing this free speech
problem
i think we have to do it
and so they did
or
they're well on their way to solving it
and i would argue that we're seeing this
massive shift of power and influence
away from
the so-called experts and the democrats
and the republicans and the people who
identified too much with the team
and toured this group of people i've
been calling the internet dads
the internet dads
again
just to be complete
it doesn't matter what your gender is
the dad is just more of a vibe it's not
it's not who you are physically or
genetically
you know i think the
mike cernovich's
are people who are just like filling a
void
that they they recognize as one
seriously nobody else is filling this
void there's nobody else tell you how to
be like
a father or a man or a good citizen or a
woman
who's doing it
and when i wrote my book had it failed
almost everything still went big i was
very much driven by the same impulse you
know of course you always want to sell a
lot of books i'm not minimizing that
but the reason i chose that topic of
essentially a way to
create systems for success
is because i didn't see anybody else
doing it
i thought to myself well who else is
who else is telling you exactly what to
do if you're 14 years old
to come up with a system that will get
you a good result
the schools don't do it
parents don't know how
who's doing it
so i mean i wrote a book just because i
felt that dad
energy i guess
literally because when i wrote it i was
writing it for my
i think then he was maybe 14
year old stepson
who needed exactly this kind of advice
so i was actually you know dabbing it
out basically but not just for my own
situation but to generalize it and so i
think that's the big story that nobody's
covering
is the
the growth or the emergence of people
who were
dads
yeah jordan peterson another one who are
leaving leaving the narrative behind
and
um
lisa booth asked you know what does it
take to get on this shadow crew
and i suggested you're on the shadow
crew
if elon musk
likes or retweets you
i i feel less fair right if elon musk
gives you a like or retweet it means
he's agreeing you know or promoting what
you said
and therefore in some minor way at least
you advised him
or or you helped him with his get his
message out either way
so yeah i think you're you're
automatically on the shadow crew if he's
ever
uh if he's ever tweeted or and you i've
seen him interact with uh cernovich
tweets several times so i know those two
are on the same
same least
communication channel
and
i would say there's no point in being
rich if you can't say what you want so
he's got that going for him
[Applause]
and so ladies and gentlemen
i would suggest this
what do you think of my
hypothesis
and i'll let me ask if any of you've had
this similar situation
i see for example you'll see somebody
step up and
let's say adopted young child
who you never think would have done that
but they're the only one who could in
that situation
so don't you see uh trump good example
um
do you do you buy my framing
that people will drop their risk
management decision making that they do
for everything else
the moment they are the only ones who
can solve a big
problem yeah okay so i'm seeing the
yeses start to come in
so one one of the things i see the
critics say uh is
they they call people uh like elon musk
fluffers that's what somebody's saying
on youtube
now let me not apologize for any of that
we we like to
create narratives around individuals
because it makes stories more
interesting and so when joe rogan was in
the headlines every day i talked about
him a lot when trump was in the
headlines every day i talked about him a
lot when aoc was in the headlines i
talked about her a lot
so i do like to wrap
all of my stories around people
because that's good writing
so i'm not going to apologize for good
writing and
most of the people i talk about
i do talk about their positives as well
so regardless of which side they're on
i generally give you their positives do
i not
quite intentionally and deliberately and
you know i usually make a big deal of it
so
for those of you who just think talking
about something in a positive way a
number of times is
uh fluffing them or hero worship
i say to you you don't know how to be a
good writer
yeah johnny depp's another example so i
i wrap all of my stories around
individuals when it's possible
it's just a good way to do it
um
oh
all right here's interesting mary lou
mawson said 30 years ago trump's
response when asked if he would ever run
to be president was quote i hope i don't
have to
i actually feel i actually feel that
trump
of course he's always drawn by
the spotlight
all right so i'm not going to ignore the
fact that his personality draws him
toward
things that make it get him attention
um
but i actually think he probably thought
nobody else could do it
and i think he was right
that he had he had a certain set of
skills like
it sounds like a movie plot he had a
certain set of skills
and i think he actually thought nobody
else could do it
and by the way where is the movie about
the
the trump um first term or are we
waiting for to see if he's gonna have a
second term
there's got to be a movie with all the
behind the scenes stuff
if anybody knows it i don't think
anybody has any idea what happened
behind the scenes with the trump
situation
let me say this more
more definitively
i can tell you with certainty
that nobody's ever reported
uh
like the real story
and and i'm not sure i know the real
story i only know enough of the real
story to know that
nothing nothing even close to the truth
has ever been
published
two thousand mules is that out yet
so that's
dinesh d'souza's
documentary is that right
so tomorrow
somebody says
uh somebody says yes it is out or this
week
may 5th i'm hearing it sound okay
so i will be looking at that with a
great interest
um
i'm going to reserve judgment
here here's how i would recommend you
watch it
you should watch it with the
understanding that within 24 hours
you're going to hear somebody try to
debunk it
and that when you hear the debunk
whether it's true or not
it might sound persuasive
because you can make anything persuasive
that's why we have trials the lawyer who
talks last is the one who's the most
persuasive
that's why the defense gets to go last
it's it's only fair
so i would say
watch the evidence in the movie
i'll definitely watch it
and then then keep your mind open for
about 24 hours because that's about how
long it'll take and there'll be articles
in the press
saying that this this or that is
incorrect
i don't know if you'll be able to sort
it out
i don't know if i will
but at least be aware
that when you watch any kind of content
like that doesn't matter if it's from
the left or the right
any kind of content like that just know
that if you don't hear the debunk or the
attempt to debunk
you don't know what's going on
if you want to learn that lesson the
hard way
watch the
competing stories about
michael jackson
you can watch a documentary that makes
it really clear
according to the documentary it's very
persuasive that he did something
terrible
and then you can watch the very next
documentary which was a response to the
first that makes it very very clear that
the first one was
they are just as convincing
if you only watch one of them
you would be absolutely convinced that
whatever anybody else said couldn't be
convincing
and then it is
they're really
banned war room episode covers in depth
what do they cover in depth
uh do you believe we are past the year
of hell that you foresaw as a child
i don't know
i don't know
i hope so
um
yeah that was a good question
so if you were confused by that question
i've i've i've described before how
there are certain things that happened
in my real life
that i foresaw as very clear
visions
many years earlier when i was young
which could be nothing but coincidence
or false memory i will acknowledge
germany is funding the russian army i
suppose
a top broadcast for you today thank you
um
oh mike lindell being banned on twitter
again that's not really a story so mike
lindell tried to sign up for twitter
again and was immediately banned
but that's just because management
hasn't changed
there's no story there but you know
can somebody answer a question for me
this is such a bubble example
if you want to see how much of a bubble
i'm in
and i i make a conscious effort every
single day every single day i read the
news on the left and the right
i don't miss a single day and here's
something i don't know
um how many of you know that the
the big account anyway or maybe all of
them the conservative twitter accounts
are surging in followers
how many of you know that's true
mostly
most of you are on twitter or most you
know that's true so mine too has surged
and it you know seemed to coincide with
the elon musk
purchase attempt
and let me tell you where it is now
so for months and months it just hovered
at one area like it couldn't possibly be
just you know
organically at that one area and stay
there and now it's up i don't know 20
000
in a few weeks
which should be very unusual
so here's the question i don't know
and how many of you know the answer okay
when i ask the question
don't answer unless you know the answer
okay there's no guessing
here's the question
are the are the number of followers also
going out up for left-leaning
big accounts
are everybody's numbers going up the
same
yeah you don't know do you
[Laughter]
are you embarrassed
are you embarrassed that you don't know
the answer to that question
because i am i mean i don't get
embarrassed but if i got embarrassed
that would be embarrassing
why the don't we know that
seriously check yourself because i'm
doing that now right so i'm talking to
myself like it sounds it sounds like i'm
insulting you but i'm insulting myself
on your behalf
why do i know that
why don't i know that
isn't that the single most important
context to understand what's going on
there how many of us have just
just automatically assumed
that twitter changed their algorithm to
stop suppressing conservative voices
how many of you just automatically
assumed that was true
and you don't even know if it's
happening to all the accounts
i don't know
yeah compared to what compared to one is
always the right question exactly
now have i made my point
every one of us
every one of us right now and this and
i'm gonna put myself in this category
every one of us who didn't know
and i still don't know
every one of us who don't know if all
the twitter accounts are going up in
followers you should be ashamed of
yourself
really
you know i'm not too bothered by shame
but if i were
i would be ashamed of myself
because i think i formed an opinion
without knowing the only thing that
mattered
huh
how many of you did that
how many of you did the same bad thing i
did formed an opinion without knowing
the most important part of the data and
not even looking for it
worse
let me slap myself a little bit
all right i deserved that i had that
coming
because not only did i not know
the answer i didn't go look for it
i don't
and i haven't seen it yet so did anybody
google it yet does anybody even care
[Laughter]
somebody says this down but i don't
think you know that dude
right anyway if you find an article or
any kind of data on that could you tweet
it at me
because it kind of matters
no it somebody's saying they don't care
no it matters
it's one of the biggest questions in the
world
because if there was in fact something
that
blatantly discriminatory going on
and it just turned off
that's really important
likewise if nothing like that was ever
happening
and it was just the elon musk news is
making all the accounts get more action
that could be it
it could be nothing except elon musk is
good at marketing and he's already
marketing the company that he expects to
own soon
it could be nothing but that
and by the way that's what he says to
this
that's why elon musk says this
he says
i saw a tweet maybe he's updated that
but the tweet i saw he said
of course the traffic of course the
followers are up
because it's getting a lot of headlines
of course
now why can't that be the whole answer
it could be
all right
tim poole reported it too i mean i know
his numbers but did he report about the
left
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is all i have
to do today i think i've met my
goal of giving you the best
entertainment you've ever seen in your
whole damn life so much so that the rest
of the day
well it's going to be awesome too
because that little dopamine surplus i
gave you that's going to last it's going
to last
and uh
you got your money's worth today
that's what i'm shooting for
all right tom
if you can't say anything better than
that
we're going to hide here on this channel
you're hidden on this channel all right
the rest of you
i'll talk to you tomorrow
