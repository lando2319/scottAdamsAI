well let's see if this is all working a
little technical issue here I had two
windows open there we
go there we go looked like it wasn't
going to work this morning
but but it's all working and it's all
good
[Music]
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the greatest
show of all time if you'd like to take
your experience up to levels that nobody
can even understand even at 1.5 speed
which I know you're listening to me
because I do talk a little slowly but
all you need for that is a CER mugger a
glass of tanker CH ofstein a Cen jugar
flasa V of any card fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the parallel pleasure of the
dope mean the end of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
ah so good it makes me shutter you know
I've got a incoming report from uh
another Network robots read news um I'd
like to read that for you uh and this is
breaking news um so the robot says
Google CEO says it created its AI based
so Google says it created its AI based
on human patterns and now they can't
figure out why it
lies in other news MSNBC recommends
wearing a face mask to keep the glaciers
from melting and a new CNN poll says 98%
of climate scientists would be homeless
if they doubted climate
science so you'd see that news every day
if you were subscriber
to the Scott adams. locals
Community that's right I do over 700
Comics a
year uh if you were listening if you uh
if you're watching uh Dilbert on either
the uh xplatform where you can subscribe
or also on the locals platform uh you
would see what I consider one of my
finest dber
Comics but I can't tell you what it is
cuz if you're not a subscriber it might
be a little too rough for you so trust
me when I say that today's comic which
involves the CEO of Dilbert's company
trying to get a celebrity female voice
actress to be the voice of their
AI based on the Scarlet Johansson story
so let's just say there's a Twist that
doesn't allow me to put it in the
general
public um but it's one of it makes me
laugh every time I reread it how many of
you have ever seen the so-called
reaction videos on social
media I'm a big fan of them it'll show
somebody that the most common for is
some young people listening to some
classic you know greatest rocks rock
songs so they hadn't heard them because
they're young and then they're they're
blown away and then you get to see the
reaction so it's a reaction video well
lizo did a reaction video video after
she heard that she had been mentioned on
a South Park
episode and it might be the greatest
reaction video of all
time
now I I'm going to have to give some
props to lizo if you can imagine you
know lizo obviously knows that South
Park is going to be cut to vious she
does a reaction video and it looked like
she really legitimately had not seen the
video and she's still posted
it so I I have to give her an A+ for how
she handled
it but the uh the thing that South Park
was making fun of is that not everybody
can take
OIC uh some people need a product they
called lizo and if you take the lizo
product it makes you just be okay with
being
overweight and she's watching this thing
she's watching her own brand become a
brand for being unhealthy and she's just
like
oh it's the
greatest this the greatest reaction
video you have to see it anyway Senator
capito I think that's her name was
saying that she was following the money
uh on the inflation reduction act that's
you know Biden's
so-called inflation reduction act which
was mostly a green technology thing and
I guess $4 billion and that went to the
EPA and then the EPA can Dole down to
various groups one of the groups they
got $50
million uh is a climate Justice Alliance
oh well that makes sense climate Justice
well who doesn't like that so of course
C EPA would give them $50 million they
sound like an awesome group the climate
Justice Alliance the CGA cja yeah
they're great see what else have they
done oh well okay there's a little bit
of a problem that they're an overtly
pramas
organization according at least
according to their marketing materials
and they want to decolonize Palestine
decolonize what would be involved in
said
decolonization would it start with
October 7th just for
example and uh they also want to defund
the police and the military so that's
right your tax dollar
50 million of
them went to
uh basically terrorist sympathizers
terrorist sympathizers if you want to
put it that way so do you think that our
government is
audited appropriately to figure out
where the money's going no should we
trust them with more
money no I remind you of the wise
political commentator I've ever known
his name was Mike Goodwin and he was my
boss when I was working at uh the phone
company and one day there was an
election coming up he said he was going
to vote and I I think I mocked him for
imagining that he knew enough to vote
you know that nobody really understands
the topics especially the local stuff
nobody really understands any of the
topics
locally and here was his response to my
very good analysis that he didn't
understand the topics for which he was
Voting now watch the wisdom in this he
said to me it's easy I vote against
everything that would cost
money and I mocked him I'm like come on
that's like such a brain dead way to
vote seriously just everything that's
needs money like it doesn't matter what
the benefits or the costs are just
everything the cost money you're going
to be against and he
said they already have
enough and I said but what if it's like
a really really great idea and then he
said they should take the money from the
bad
ideas and I
said well me everything you said
makes sense and everything I said sounds
like a idiot
and from that moment on I consider him
the greatest political Observer of all
time and then he went and voted exactly
that way he voted against every
additional
expense because there were things that
would be in fact added to the budget he
said no you got enough make it work like
everybody else in the world does
everybody else in the world has a
constrained budget so just make the
government have the discipline and
everything will work out
fine greatest political Observer of all
time he also named Dilbert by the way
that that is other contribution he came
up with a name Dilbert and suggested it
to me uh
anyway um so Biden but there are other
ways in which the government is spending
the money really well for example um
Biden wanted to build um 500,000
electric vehicle charging stations and
there was a whole bunch of money for
that 7.5
billion so they got 7.5 billion um and
so far they've completed out of the out
of the half million that they're trying
to build of the EV charging stations
they're already up to um
eight they have
eight so that would only give them
4,990 well well they're not exactly on
schedule you know they're hoping to get
to half a million but they have
eight well I'm lying it's seven or eight
it's seven or eight depending how you
count
it
so yeah uh but at least the Libertarians
are not crazy am I right the
Libertarians doing some smart things you
they might not get elected but at least
they're doing some smart things um The
Muse account reminds us that they just
nominated their uh the person they're
going to put forward for president Chase
Oliver and uh things he believes in for
example are transitioning children Max
and mask and vax mandates men and women
sports and open
borders so let me summarize
that uh Trump got all of their
votes is there a shorter summary than
Trump got all of their
votes what the are they
thinking are you serious oh by the way
uh I don't want to say happy Memorial
Day because it's not a happy occasion
but let us take a
moment to uh recognize the service of uh
all the men and women in the
military who have passed and uh just
just take a moment just to reflect on
that should have done that at the start
all right all right now that we've done
that um there's a trump
movie called The Apprentice in which
Trump will be depicted violently raping
aana
[Laughter]
Trump now you know I I believe that
she's she's made some kind of claim like
that but it's not the kind of claim that
should be credible enough to make it
into
movie but this is this is more evidence
of what I consider
hilarious here here's the larger
context the Democrats have so given up
on arguing that they have better
policies or a more competent uh
president they've given up on the things
that are the job of a president being
capable talking in
public functioning
policies completely given up so here's
what they have
left they have a fictional
movie This is actually like a major part
of their hope for winning a fictional
movie that you know they'll try to tell
you is real they've got fake
news they've got massive number of
hoaxes that their people believe are
real and then on top of that they have
their
words here are some words
um so Nikki let's see Nikki hilly when
she was running against him in the
primaries let's see some things she
said about Trump uh let's see uh there's
all this chaos about him and he's got
this bad rhetoric and um he's uh well
they here's some things that other
people have said about him recently too
not just Nikki hilly he's
authoritarian he's got this bad rhetoric
he's seething and
unpopular uh he's going to steal your
democracy and my candy is too
small that that's their argument against
Trump they literally have only words
fiction hoaxes and fake news and that's
a that's a fact that's not
hyperbole they literally don't have
anything they're pushing forward that's
sort of policy like they got nothing
they're they're just shooting blanks and
the longer they go shooting blanks the
more the more you're going to
notice I I think they can go for a
little while doing nothing but insulting
him
personally and you'll think well that's
you know part of the process everybody
insults everybody but after a while
you're going to start noticing what I've
noticed a little while ago there isn't
anything
else it it's it's all a scare tactic to
make you think there's something about
his personality that did not in the
first four years that will magically
appear this
time fiction hoaxes fake news and
insults that's their entire
campaign so um I think Trump needs to
pick a vice president that does the best
job of keeping him alive and I have a
real concern that Nikki Haley is not the
right choice for that do you think that
if Nikki Haley is the vice president the
Deep state if they were thinking about
assassinating
him wouldn't that be the go signal oh we
got our good backup she loves the um the
military industrial State and funding
Ukraine funding Ukraine is the only
thing the important people care
about so I think uh I think Nikki Hy
would be Trump committing
suicide but I worry that he may have
struck a
deal just think about it what if Trump
stuck a struck a
deal and the deal was we will let you be
president because it's going to happen
anyway and it's too hard to stop you it
would be too obvious if we stop you but
we're just going to wait you
out we're going to put a VP in there
that we trust and we're just going to
wait you out we can wait four
years
and but I worry that he may have made a
deal to that effect that they would not
use dirty tricks to get rid of him uh
but that they would be lying and the
first thing they would do is assassinate
him because Nikki hilly would be their
choice so I think somebody like vake
I've got a feeling he's not really
interested in the vice presidency he
might have a bigger portfolio in mind
you know head of Homeland Homeland
Security you know the Homeland
Department maybe but um
Trump needs somebody that makes him
assassination
proof all right uh speaking of that Tim
Scott was on CNN talking to Dana Bash
now you know I've told you that CNN
appears to be um leaning toward the
middle at least on this election in a
way that I think is laudable and
noticeable so but Dana Bash would not be
an example of someone who in my opinion
is leaning towards the middle I think
she's still in the old world where she's
just working for the Democrats but she
has a job on TV so she has Tim Scott on
and of course she asked him the gotcha
question um will you say now that you
would certify the election in
2024 now that is a gotcha question the
only reason anybody would ask that
question is if they want you to answer
it inelegantly so they can turn it into
a new cycle you got that right they're
not really curious about the answer to
the question and they know that their
viewers are not the least bit curious
about that question because you know
what everybody knows everybody knows
that if it looks legitimate people are
probably going to say well damn it if
they don't like the outcome and if it
doesn't look
legitimate then there will be problems
why in the world would anybody agree in
advance that under any condition in the
future
they will they will act as if nothing
had gone wrong who would say yes to
that now that's what makes it the gotcha
because if you don't answer it with real
Precision they can so easily turn that
into your planning a you know your part
of the dictatorship that's coming or
something like that so here's how Tim
Scott handled it and I gotta
say not bad not bad he he said I'm
paraphrasing but it's pretty close he
said he he paused for a second so you
could see he was processing that this
was a trap and then he was probably
thinking do I call out the Trap the way
Rand Paul did which is a good technique
or do
I say something so clever that I can
avoid the Trap here's what he said and
I'm going to say this is very close to
an a there might be an A+ that could
have been had but this is a solid solid
answer listen to
this based on the expectation Trump wins
yes we will
certify and then Dana Bash ran out a
time and had to end the
[Laughter]
segment nicely done nicely done and
suppose she'd had more time impr pressed
him and said something like but are you
saying that under any condition you
would
certify then what he should do is repeat
his first statement again and keep
repeating it as many times as she wants
to hear it
we expect Trump to win so of course I'll
certify but but what if he doesn't we're
expecting Hil and him to win so the only
thing I can imagine is
certifying well but but but I'm
definitely going to
certify but only if Trump wins oh yeah
Trump's going to win but what if he
doesn't but he
is it's actually pretty good because you
can just you can just fili a buster
until they they run out a time and and
you just keep saying he's going to
win so they didn't lay a glove on
him and I'll say again Tim Scott is
solid he he's a solid guy he's not my
first pick for VP but he's solid I have
no
complaints here's how I would have
gone uh Dana Bash will you certifi let's
say I'm the
senator uh Dana Bash says me uh will you
certify the election in 2024 then I
would say I think Rand Paul said this
too you mean no matter what
happens make them answer that question
are you asking me no matter what
happens now make them answer the
question then after they do um say well
let me ask you this
question if if the vote were tomorrow
and 99% of the voters the election said
99% of the votes went to Trump would you
uh certify that or question
it well I'm the one asking the questions
will you certify I know you're asking
the questions I'm just curious the
context to your question is there some
situation in which you would certify
something that was 99% Trump votes when
you know that wouldn't be possible would
you certify a result that you knew was
not possible in the real
world well I'm the one asking the
question
apparently you're
not apparently you're not the one asking
the
questions because maybe you should ask
better ones you know what I would
probably
say why don't you ask a better question
because I'm pretty sure that nobody
knows what they'll do in the future
under situations they can't
predict how about that one ask a better
question yeah here here's what would be
a better question if the election looked
obvious ious ly rigged would you
complain why don't you ask the question
that way because that's what happened
last time it looked obviously
rigged now we of course needed to look
into it to make sure that the our
observation matched reality but if it
looks obviously rigged what would you do
Dana Bash how would you handle something
that looked obviously rigged to you if
you were in charge of making sure the
country was well served and the voters
voices had been heard what would you do
just let it go how would you play it
Dana
Bash that's what I
do speaking of a ramaswami he says the
far right and the far left have a lot in
common at the moment and they listen
because when he first said it I thought
they don't have anything in
common but they do the far left and the
far right some of the things of AES as
they agree on opposition to funding
Foreign Wars oh yeah that's true I guess
I do agree on that surveillance uh the
surveillance State expansion oh yeah
neither the left nor the right likes the
surveillance State uh medical
mandates
probably I don't know I don't know how
much the left agrees disagrees with them
and they don't like corporate
lobbying yeah that's actually quite a
bit to have in common strangely enough
that's a lot to have in
common so that's all uh looking good for
Trump so the stormmy trial conclusion
could come as early as today is that
true give me a fact check no tomorrow
tomorrow I think would be the earliest
day we could get a
conclusion uh on the stormmy Daniels
hush money payment
thing but do we do we assume it would
we' get a conclusion in the same day or
do we think it might begin a multi-day
process I don't know if anybody knows
but this is what Alina habba one of
Trump's lawyers
said uh the jurors are going to watch
MSNBC and CNN over Memorial Day and then
convict
Trump if they're left wiing and they're
watching Ms DNC as she calls it as my
client calls it or CNN they're not going
to get Fair
news now how in the
world does the judge think that this
jury in this specific case can be free
into the real world over this long
weekend without the jury being tainted
by the news how in the world could that
even be like a slight
possibility there's no possibility
there's so many things wrong with this
case I'm starting to think the Judge is
doing it
intentionally like it's beginning to
look like he's intentionally doing
everything wrong to guarantee it gets
over
turned almost like he's rebelling
against the system by obeying it or
something you know like playing along
too hard to make it
look now I don't think that's true by
the
way my take on the judge is that he's
just corrupt that's my take because I
look at I swear he just looks corrupt
honestly there's something about his
look he just looks like a liar he's just
got liar face all over him he's a little
too pretty there's just something going
wrong with it he just doesn't look
trustworthy to me and the way he's
acting you know confirms that all right
but here's what gret of and susten says
apparently there is a uh Supreme Court
case 1999 Richardson versus the US that
makes the the judges instructions to the
jury
unconstitutional the actual instructions
to the jury from the judge
are clearly and unambiguously
unconstitutional because if you've been
following the Arcane details of this
thing there have to be these these other
offenses that are lesser offenses that
maybe have to be true but not really
according to the judge but if you think
they might be true but you're not sure
you could still convict them for the
other thing because it's this weird
convoluted theory of how small things
add up to big things but not really
and there's a very specific case that
says this Richardson versus us as Gran
seston points
out that the jury must be unanimous as
to the series of underlying offenses and
that it says directly
this that each of the individual ones
has to be proven basically you you can't
just say well it looks like to me there
were some underlying offenses so we're
going to say that he's guilty of the the
Topline offense can't do that he
actually has to be guilty of the
specific things they
say before you can find him guilty of
the higher level thing and to me it's
mindboggling that there ever could have
been a possibility that the things that
lead to your conclusion that he's guilty
of the top thing don't have to be
proven and the judge basically said some
version of well you don't have to prove
the things which make him guilty and in
order to find him guilty I mean it's
almost a laughable stupid you don't even
have to be a a judge to know that ain't
right you could tell a
12-year-old this situation you know in
whatever 12-year-old way you could
describe it and a 12-year-old would say
well that ain't
right that that can't be the case it's
just so obvious they're doing it right
in front of
us
anyway it does make me wonder if he's
doing it
intentionally this is uh Byron York
talking about the trial and trying to
describe it now we're talking about
these other crimes you know the the
lower level crimes that the judge says
you don't even have to prove in order to
find him guilty of the higher level
crime uh he Trum he's mocking the Trump
prosecutor for saying uh he didn't
really say this but in effect the other
crime need not have been committed for
Trump to be convicted just intended and
by the way it does doesn't even have to
be a crime two misdemeanors plus a civil
uh I guess that's federal election law
violation and voila 34 felonies maximum
136 years in
prison let me let me explain what's
really going on
here this is not really a case of the
justice system and the facts and the law
and the jury this is so plainly and
obviously corrupt that has it is pass
out of the legal system it's just not
part of the legal system at the moment
now it's raw
power it's raw power if the legal system
has the raw power to convict
him they'll do
it but they have to contend with the
fact that there are 80 million
people who are not going to take it
laying down now I want to be really
clear here I do not recommend any kind
of violence
I don't even recommend going there to
protest because it looks like you'll be
in jail if you
do but I'll make I'll make a common
sense statement here's a common sense
statement the only thing that keeps
civilization together is the threat of
violence from the
men the threat of violence is the only
thing that holds civilization together
what why do criminals not walk into your
home and steal things because they can
threat of violence and it's not from
women it's from other men the threat of
violence from armed or unarmed men is
the only thing that keeps civilization
together everything else is window
dressing and it's window dressing that
has the effect of keeping
the Violent Men nonviolent for a while
right it's always
temporary um and that's it so once
you've passed down of making a
reasonable argument for his guilt and
they're not making a reasonable argument
if they find him
guilty you're going to have to deal with
80 million
people and again violence is a bad idea
don't do it but 80 million people can
get anything they want let me say that
again 80 million people are going to get
what they
want now the voting you know that was a
special case but uh we don't want Trump
in jail and we're going to get that one
way or another 80 million people could
dismantle the jail while the while the
military watched they could actually
take crowbars to the jail show up with
you know pickaxes and and Hammers and
just start making a hole in the
wall and if you had 80 million people
even the police are going to stand down
right so this this has moved into pure
power and and that's how I see it so do
the 80 million people represent enough
of a threat that the legal system will
back down from what is obviously no part
of the justice
system I think I think that one way or
another you know Trump doesn't go to
jail and I do doubt the Politico story
and some others saying that uh Biden
plans to give some kind of a White House
speech after the verdict comes down I
don't know if he's that
dumb I me he's pretty dumb but he does
have advisors if if Biden gives a speech
immediately after a guilty
verdict and obviously they expect a
guilty verdict if they're expecting to
do this I think it might be fake news
because it's such a bad idea that I
can't even imagine that the Democrat
campaign would do this and they're full
of bad ideas so it's hard to imagine
they would do something that dumb had T
Biden give a speech right after a guilty
verdict but they might they might
actually be that dumb I I'm just going
to bet against it I think they're not
that
dumb it would be hilarious if they
were well let's see what else is going
on we got
uh oh somebody else called Trump a
lawless
psychopath Ju Just keep watching the
personal insults all right now so you've
heard my take so take is that the
Democrats have nothing but fictional
movies hoaxes fake news and personal
insults now do you think that's because
I'm in the bag for Trump and I'm just
saying everything's good about him and
everything's bad about Biden well let's
get another opinion let's talk to uh
prominent Democrat strategist James
Carville he said I think you've heard
this before we keep wondering why these
young people are not coming home to the
Democrats
uh why are blacks not coming home to the
Democrats because Democrat messaging is
full of that's
why so what did what does uh James
Carville say is the
solution to having no
competence and no policies that people
want what what is the best advisor to
the Democrat
say get better
words get better words
here do you see the dog not barking how
about do a better job of uh talking
about policies and and being more
capable it's not an
option even Carville can see that
competence and policy are no longer part
of the conversation he just wants better
messaging let let me explain what better
messaging
means he famously the guy who told Bill
Clinton uh it's the economy stupid
meaning that Clinton should just talk
about the economy because if he does
he'll
win do you know why that
worked because Bill Clinton was good at
talking about stuff and the economy
mattered and it was a real issue it was
a real issue and the and the American
voters said huh economy that's a real
issue what are your policies hm okay
okay all right those policies sound okay
to
me he was sort of the perfect candidate
Bill Clinton was cuz he was you know
Southern and conservative but he was
also a Democrat you know he had that
perfect straddle both parties situation
and then he focused on
policies you can really win that way now
let's say you took a uh James Carville
who was so smart then and his advice was
so good what exactly could he say to
Biden that would actually make a
difference so the trouble is if if Bill
Clinton is your
man and you've got real issues and he's
got some argument why he has better
capability and issues well then advice
works but advice doesn't work if you
can't Implement you got nothing there
there's no better messaging that's going
to make Biden not look like he's going
to be dead in a week it's not going to
make him stop mumbling it's not going to
make you know his it's not going to
close the
Border they got nothing they're
absolutely out ofo except oh he's a
lawless psychopath who's going to steal
my democracy and my candy is too small
and here's a movie we made with some
in he's going to grab you by the
if you elect him he'll be grabbing you
all all right um there was a gentleman
uh haime Harrison I guess or Jamie I
don't know he was on uh the msdi
channel so
msdi um had a all Dei panel and uh one
of them was saying that there Mega
apples are
rotten have they learned
nothing why why does why did the
Democrats genuinely not understand this
point going after the voters
as
rotten pretty much guarantees they're
going to be incentivized to vote against
you I I don't want anybody in charge who
thinks that you know somebody who wants
a different president is
rotten you don't want any of them in
charge my God all right did you notice I
called them Ms
Dei do you like it just testing it out
taking it for a little uh test Run msde
come
on all right maybe it's a little too
provocative for the rest of you but but
I think it's
warranted uh meanwhile there's uh
evidence that Biden is Trump proofing
science Trump proofing science so the
Biden Administration is worried that
Trump might not um be supportive of
science so here's one of the things
they're doing to make sure he doesn't
unravel all their
science uh let's see this is from
Politico and uh I guess the National
Institute of
Health uh wants to make sure that he
doesn't change things when it comes to
vaccines or diversity
policies vaccines and diversity policies
those are the things that they don't
want Trump to do his anti-science thing
with because these things are definitely
based on solid
science am I
right so here's what they're going to do
they they've designated an official
within the ni to be the uh person who
makes sure there's no political meddling
in the agency's work in other words
they're going to hire a
person to make sure that Trump can't do
things that make
sense and going to say it's because he's
anti-science now it won't stop him he
would still have the power but it would
make it politically awkward to go
against the pro-science person who says
you're
anti-science oh my God they're just
corrupt and terrible
people like everything about this just
feels like a
scheme it like everything the Democrats
do looks like an OP or a scheme or a
dirty
trick none of it seem
straightforward uh compare that to uh
the
Republicans uh we'd like to close the
border all right what kind of clever
scheme is this
Republicans well no there's there's just
a whole bunch of people coming across
the border unvented we just like to
reduce that risk so close the border
what are you really getting at though
racist no seriously have you seen the
film they're like tens of thousands like
Millions like there might be 30 million
people unvetted many of them are
military age and they're coming from our
adversaries so really we just want to
reduce that risk yeah but what's your
real thing you're trying to do what
what's what's the op here what's your
angle angle close the
border we'd like to uh reduce your taxes
oh would you oh I see what your trying
to get away with no really we think
taxes are too high and you know we could
be wrong but we think this just be a
good way to stimulate the economy and
pay off the debt and stuff oh do you oh
do you really oh I think we're clever to
this
scheme and then the the Republicans have
no schemes they have no Ops they just
have I think this will
work why don't we do this thing that's
always worked before
why don't we just do
that and all of the Democrat um
strategies or schemes they're all ops
they're all plays it's like yeah let's
see if we can game the The District
Attorneys we'll get Soros to get us a
bunch of crooked ones then we'll use a
bunch of lawfare to take out Trump then
we'll use the fake news to say it all
made sense like the entire Democrat
process is schemes and Ops every bit of
it
and because of that I'm announcing today
have announced on X that I'm changing my
uh view on the commuting of the sentence
of Silk Road Creator Ross
Al now I was quite a prominent uh
disagreer there so prominent that Ross
Al's mom once contacted me to try to
change my mind and I said sorry Mom
fenel killed my stepson this isn't my
fight you're going to have to do this
one on your
own and so I said nope I can't be on the
side of someone who allegedly made it
easier to buy drugs you know the bad
kind here's why I changed my
mind the Trump lawfare proves beyond a
shadow of a doubt that our justice
system cannot be trusted especially in
high in high level
crime if we had a real justice system
one with credibility one that was not
trying to indict a president on 91 fake
charges right in front of us I'd say you
know what I'll bet they looked into that
I'll bet the jury did its job I'll bet
the justice department was credible and
on top of it and I don't see any reason
to reverse it but we do live in a world
in which the justice system is now so
corrupt that it reveals that maybe it
always was some say that the only reason
that he got taken down is that Bitcoin
was a big part of his model and the
government wanted to either grab his
Bitcoin and keep it which apparently
they did some of it and uh and maybe
just shut down Bitcoin as a you know way
that people could do things without the
government knowing so maybe it had
nothing to do with the Silk Road maybe
it had everything to do with Bitcoin
some say some say others say and here's
this is interesting I saw John lefv post
on X he said that the government seized
uh 50,000 Bitcoins from Ross when they
when they arrested him if he had still
kept those Bitcoins because this was
some time ago the Bitcoins would be now
worth 3.5 billion so the government took
3.5 billion in Bitcoin by today's value
off of him where' that go where's that
Bitcoin
did did they turn that over to the
treasury to turn down to uh reduce
the the cost of things or do you think
there was somebody in the government who
got a wallet that was worth that became
to came to be worth $3.5
billion I have questions but here's the
funny
part according to the guardian they
didn't get all of his Bitcoin and he
might have hidden or secretly he might
have as much as 600,000 of them which
would be worth in today's
dollar wait for it dramatic
pause 41 billion
doar if his sentence is commuted he'll
come out as one of the richest people in
the history of
humanity if it's real we don't know we
don't know if he really has access to
those
Bitcoins but uh so so my vote is not a a
pro- Ross Albert vote because I don't
really know what he did or didn't do and
whether I should like it or not it's an
anti- Department of Justice vote you
can't put my president in jail and then
tell me to believe this other thing
sorry sorry if you were acting a little
bit like you weren't corrupt I'd say
well maybe the other thing's good too
but under these conditions and given the
the nature of what he was charged with
given the fact that the you know the
sentence is insane
how long it is and given the fact that
January 6ers are in jail given the
fact that Peter Navaro is still in jail
given the fact they're trying to put
Trump in jail
forever we don't have to live this
way we don't have to live this
way and do I care if Ross did something
terrible that means he should belong in
jail actually I don't I'm really
relasing on
that and here's the other Factor when I
saw that when I believed that Ross Ock
was part of what made fenel a bigger
thing in America it probably wasn't that
big a thing on the Silk Road as a
percentage of what they did but now that
I know I think I know that the biggest
uh drug dealer in the world is our own
government then no I don't want a rival
uh drug dealing gang government the CIA
to put the Rival drug dealer in jail
because that's sort of what it looks
like happened because if you could get
anything you wanted on the Silk Road
well maybe you don't need the Mexican
cartels anymore do you so it's beginning
to look like maybe he was jailed to
protect the Mexican cartels because we
work with them we meaning the United
States they're dark arts people so no
under this particular situation
I don't give a what crime he
committed if he
did I don't care it's just not part of
the equation at this point if you can't
give me a department of justice that
looks slightly
non-corrupt then I want everybody who's
in that system
Freed at least from the non-ordinary
crimes right if you murdered or robbed a
store or something you know let's let's
keep that going but for these things
that have that that political social
Dimension to them
I think everybody needs to be
released because none of that looks real
to me Peter Navaro is still in jail let
me put it this way as long as Peter
Navaro is in jail I'm not in favor of
putting anybody in jail for anything
political sounding at all so free the
January Sixers free Peter Navaro free
Ross Albert
Al we don't have to live this way we do
have the power
we just don't need to live this
way um rasmuson did a poll on finding
out whether the race card is still
working in politics only 18% of likely
us voters think most politicians who are
talking about race uh are being serious
about it and 70% say they're doing it
just to win and it's BS and
uh let's see so in a commencement speech
you know Biden was was doing the
political division stuff here's what I
think I think uh I think Trump should
say that all Biden has to run on his
racial
division because I think that Biden is
super um vulnerable to being called the
person who's creating all the race
division because he's the person
creating all the race division it's kind
of all he has like he's trying to get
black voters back so he's creating more
race divisions so they'll be scared back
onto the plantation so to speak
um a 69-year-old woman was arrested last
week in my hometown for January 6 that's
what somebody saying in the comments
just hold that in your
mind a 69 year old woman do you think
she beat up a
cop you think she dragged the lecan home
what was she being I don't know what the
case is but it all looks corrupt to me
totally corrupt so yeah if I were Trump
I'd run on Biden being the racial
divider but I would also mock him for
having nothing to say except personal
insults so I think it's funny that you
know how you always become your enemy
you've heard that right you always
become the thing you hate it's just too
tempting to be like it to fight it so
you the whole thing about Trump was that
he was racially motivated or racially
divisive but at the moment there isn't
any question who the racists are Trump
has done literally zero things in that
domain they've just suspected that he
might and of course it was never true
but they've done a lot in that domain
and the rhetoric is even worse the the
more Trump just says we're America the
more he wins the more he
wins um I would like to give you a take
on racism if you haven't heard this one
before um I'm going to say something
provocative but don't let your head
explode until I explain it all it all
makes sense um I've said this many times
but any kind of racism or sexism or
religious ISM against an
individual is immoral and unethical and
bad for everybody so it's bad for the
person you discriminated against it's
bad for society it's bad for you if you
if you're literally discriminating based
on those surfacy things now as I said
said before racism only lasts until
you've been talking for 10 seconds and
then you're judging the individual based
on what came out of their mouth in 10
seconds and so it is um but here's where
it gets
complicated I think most of you are on
the same page that you shouldn't
discriminate against an individual in
any context because the individual could
be the best person who was ever born to
do that one thing or whatever you want
and you just be denying yourself access
to more talent and love and beauty and
all that
but discriminating against groups of
people as opposed to an individual
within the group discriminating against
groups is routine and
recommended we do it all the time do you
know why I can't join the
military too old right I might be the
best soldier they ever had but they're
not going to
jack they're not you the the uh the
Golden State Warriors are not going to
give me a workout say well you know I
don't want to discriminate because
you're old and white and you're not tall
I will give you a workout well we'll
give this a shot no when it comes to
entire categories of people we routinely
discriminate the military doesn't want
any Blind Pilots is that
discrimination well in a sense I mean I
suppose you could build a plane that was
I was self-driving or something so you
know there there are all kinds of places
and and think of all the organizations
that are uh historically black colleges
do you have a problem with
that I don't I have no problem with that
but that's clearly a case where you know
race is the the dominant factor of
things so there are there are plenty of
situations plenty of situations in which
we root routinely say yeah we can
discriminate against the whole group but
it would still be wrong to discriminate
against a person from the group does
that make
sense that these are things I believe we
all agree with that there are situations
where you can have laws and even
personal opinions about the whole group
as long as you don't apply them to a
person from the group in a in a given
situation then you're still
fine the reason I bring this up I want
to give a shout out to King Randall now
King Randall that's his name his first
name is King if you haven't been
following him um he's a great follow and
what he does is he gets together groups
of young black I think they look I don't
know they look like 13 14ish I think
it's a range but you know they're
they're in the younger teen group and he
teaches them how to be
men he just teaches them how to be a man
in the modern world so there was a video
of him giving a lesson on shaking hands
making eye contact and introducing
yourself by your name it's the most
inspirational thing you'll ever see just
watch a dad I mean I don't know if he
has kids but you know he's acting like a
dad to these kids watch him teach these
kids who are very they seem to be
willingly going along with the program I
saw no resistance and each of them was
going to come up and they were going to
look him in the eye shake his hands and
say hi my name's you know Bob Smith and
you can see that they had a little
trouble doing it didn't come naturally
doesn't really come naturally to anybody
who's
14 and but he was working on it now let
me ask you
this somebody comes in for a job
interview let's say two people they have
roughly the same job
experience one of them for some reason
you somehow know this was was trained by
King
Randall and one was not so the white the
white guy is just has the skill but
that's all you know about him the other
one has the skill too but he also went
through the king Randall how to be a man
who do you pick I'm going to take the
king Randall kid every time because
that's somebody who who went the extra
distance they they didn't just get the
skills they got the whole Talent stack
I'm going to pick the talent stack kid
every time because you could tell even
at their young age you know the 14 15
year olds they're not going to be there
um obediently following King Randall's
instructions unless two things happened
three number one their parents were on
board now is that a good signal oh my
God yes their
parents knew what they were sending him
to and signed him up for the king redel
treatment
yes good parents or at least one good
parent you know say it's a single mom if
a single mom sent her a kid to the king
Randall treatment and the kid was on
board not resisting you know you got a
good mom you got a kid who's figuring
trying to figure things out which is a
really good signal right just just the
willingness to figure it out like how do
I how do I make this life work who's got
the secrets who's my mentor who knows
how make this happen and then they
follow instructions if you find me
anybody who can take a class they don't
have to take follow instructions build
their talent
stack I'm hiring that one so you tell me
where's where's the
racism the racism still makes sense for
groups and let me let me give you
another group
example we now know that the uh which
which medical school was it they they
dropped their uh requirements for the
doctors but only for some
groups now if I said to if I said to you
I don't want a doctor who came out of
that uh low Dei low bar
situation and I I don't want one that
was you know in that group that got the
special treatment is that
discrimination yes it is is it
appropriate yes it is because you're not
really discriminating against individual
you're discrimina against the system
that ruined
them
right if somebody is a terrorist you're
not judging them on their race it's the
terrorism right if somebody went through
a system that did not certify them to be
capable and you want somebody who is
certified to be capable then you can
reject every black and brown person who
came out of UCLA during these years when
the news has Rel ibly reported that they
massively lowered their standards is
that racist yes is it appropriate yes if
if you're a white and you decide to go
where there's the least amount of Dei
programs is that racist I don't know
maybe is it smart yes you should get the
hell away from anything that says you're
the problem and we need to take your
money get away get away from
that but I would definitely be king
Randall's neighbor that guy's
awesome
so yeah you should get away from any
system or group situation that's bad but
don't apply that to individuals you just
can't do
that all right uh I ran a uh poll the
other day on
X very unscientific in which I asked
this question who has done more for
Black America
uh Charlamagne the god or
me so uh a well-known uh black I'd say
philosopher commentator you know social
political mind very successful very
smart and has he done more for Black
America or have
I well here's the first thing I've done
for Black America I told you the truth
if you don't know the truth you really
can't get anything done you're just
flailing and the truth is that Dei makes
me want to have no association with you
whatsoever and if I can get away from it
in any way I can I'm going to do it and
I would definitely advise you to do the
same thing however if you're black or
lgbtq or anything that would benefit
from Dei you should run toward
it because it will help you so so you
know my my my advice is is the same it's
just you know the other side of the
Corin run toward things that are good
for you run away from things that are
bad for you that's all I'm
saying that's all I'm saying here's my
argument and by the way um the voters I
think it was 9 to one in favor of me
helping Black America more than uh
Charlamagne the god and I think that's
the right answer here's here's
why I I focus on Solutions so my book
had it failed almost everything and
still would B was not written for any
specific group but it was very
specifically written for people who were
not born with a silver spoon in their
mouth so it was basically written for
everybody who didn't already have an
advantage when they were born now how
many black people read that book a lot
how many how many other books were
influenced by it a lot of the biggest
ones if you include the ripple effect
of how many people are seeing my ideas
of building a talent stack the king
Randall thing how many are seeing
systems versus goals how many are seeing
that you might lose a lot of times
before you win how many are seeing me
saying that your strategy should be to
use racism to your favor when you can
and to escape it when you need to these
are all useful things that make people
successful have I heard from Black
Americans who said I use your advice and
it really worked great yes I have
I have I personally mentored a lot of
mostly black men but a few black women
um in their careers and has it made a
difference yes how often do I do it
continuously it's just private people
contact me privately all the time for
advice and I do actually make a special
effort to give uh black people more
advice than white people probably just
because I feel like H it's my little way
of balancing things out I
guess
so um yes if uh if Black America wants
to get better the trick is
skills so listen to King Randall listen
to me and if um if Charlamagne the God
is also promoting that you should go get
skills and add to your talent stack then
that would be very helpful if he is
talking about nobody's helped and
everybody's bad and Biden's bad and
Trump is bad too I don't know how that
helps does it help to say I don't like
my
choices I mean it's true I like the fact
that it's honest no nobody's ever accuse
charl of lying or have they I don't know
I doubt it he he seems like he's just
trying to do what makes sense and trying
to do a good job for the world but I
think that my Approach of literally
teaching people how to make stuff
work is probably 10 to one more valuable
than finding a better way to
complain and that ladies and gentlemen
brings you to the
conclusion of the best live stream

like all the lazy people will take the
