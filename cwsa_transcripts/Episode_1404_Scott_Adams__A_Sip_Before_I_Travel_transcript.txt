well well well what a day today is going
to be
let me tell you about my day before we
get to the simultaneous sip
you may have heard that i plan to take a
vacation today
ah i might but i don't know yet
if i'm going to go on the vacation of a
lifetime
in about an hour and a half or
i'm not here's my
problem so my destination just so you
know
is uh santorini greece little island off
of greece
uh very expensive like
insanely expensive so expensive i would
only do this once in my life
probably would never spend this much
money on another vacation
just just once i wanted to spend some
dilbert money
it's a prepaid vacation so the money's
already spent
whether i go or not and the good news
about greece
is that they allow you to go in if
you've had your second vaccination
you don't need to wait the two weeks
after the second vaccination
which is good because it's only about 12
days
since my second vaccination so no
problem at all
flying from the united states into
greece
if you're fully vaccinated
but uh yesterday afternoon ran
into a little wrinkle turns out that we
have a three and a half hour layover
in germany and germany
doesn't let you in until you've got
two weeks two days short
can't even fill out the paperwork to get
on the plane
so as of right now i don't know
if i'm going to greece on the trip of a
lifetime
that i would leave right after this
broadcast
so yesterday afternoon christina finds
the last
place in san francisco that's available
to
give you a test and a result a cova test
because the alternative is you got to
get a kova test
so if i could get a kova test and a
result
that's negative prior to getting on the
flight
i can go
i won't be able to know the result of
the test
for two more hours which is about when
the car service
leaves to pick me up so one of two
things is going to happen
by 9 am this morning my time i will
either
unpack all of my bags and watch
christina
go on the trip of a lifetime because she
might as well go
you know if i can if i can go or not
it's already prepaid she might as well
go
but i will either unpack my bags or go
on the trip of a lifetime
that i've already paid for
uh now i'm not taking a private jet but
it's a it's a hell of a it's a hell of a
flight
so i sped to san francisco
uh defying possibly some speeding
limits got my test taken
and if it's not a false positive
think about this if it's a false
positive
which is probably the only thing it
could be because i'm pretty well
vaccinated
if it's a false positive i don't get to
go
and that's a pretty good possibility if
they lose it or they have a typo on it
i don't get to go if it's late
i don't get to go if they forgot to send
it into the lab last night
i don't get to go so i don't know if i'm
going on the trip of a lifetime but i
might
in the meantime let's see if we can
enjoy ourselves with the simultaneous
setball you need is a
copper marker or glass a tanker jealous
time a canteen drinker flash f vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
want to hear a weird coincidence so i i
mentioned on my live stream that i had a
trip
upcoming but i didn't say anything about
it i didn't say it was overseas
i just said i had a trip coming i get a
message from dr drew
who i've known for some time through the
internet and uh
and interviews on the show etc and
dr drew said where are you going because
i have a feeling
we're going to the same place now how
weird is that
right what are the odds that out of the
entire planet
that he and i would be going to the same
place
at the same time it was even weird
question right
like why would you even ask
so i told him where i was going and it
turns out we'll be within walking
distance
so we're probably going to get together
and have lunch that's right
we're going to the same freaking place
on the other side of the planet
within walking distance and
he guessed that with no clues
what is going on how do you guess that
with no clues other than i have a
vacation planned
not only that but if i get on the flight
it's going to be the same flight i think
or at least the flight from germany
might be the same
so that's what's going on let's talk
about the news
there was a diver off of cape cod
who was swallowed by a whale
and then spit out you know i have to
tell
you that my own uh religious training
went off the rails when i heard about
jonah and the whale
when i heard the bible story about jonah
being swallowed by a big fish
and then spit out some days later
perfectly fine
i said to myself you know i'm not sure i
can buy into this religion
and that was sort of the breaking point
for me was the the jonas story
but i think i think i'm gonna have to
reassess
my entire religious upbringing because
there was an actual diver who was
swallowed by a whale and then the whale
spit him out
now technically he wasn't in the whale's
stomach
he but he was completely within the
whale's mouth i guess the whale was
doing this
lunge feeding it's called where they
just opened their mouth and go through a
bunch of stuff
and just eat everything that's in the
way he happened to be in the way
so he had his scuba d not scuba but
diving gear on
so he could still breathe while he was
in the oil's mouth for about 30 seconds
and the whale breached and spit him out
and he was like
and next thing you know he was a little
uh shaken but not stirred
so i don't know if he was praying when
he was in there but
uh maybe a giant fish can eat a person
and spit him out fine i don't know
nasa is testing an electric plane
why i don't really know why does nasa
have anything to do with commercial
flight but i guess they do
because they're testing their own
electric airplane for
you know for use on earth as part of
developing standards for commercial
aircraft
so this is sort of a big deal because
airplanes
are going to be electric and all those
airplanes that you hated that are the
same technology for 30 years
maybe maybe we can get a new kind of air
travel that's not
horrible i'm going to spend maybe 18
hours on a plane
today or unpacking and staying home
one of those two things is going to
happen but
uh i would sure like to have a better
way to fly maybe these
electric planes will be a way to
re-energize the the fleets
so bill maher is getting a lot of
criticism for being open-minded
and not taking aside and just arguing
that side no matter how stupid it is
and he's arguing that progressives have
something called progressophobia i think
i think stephen pinker came up with that
but
it's if you think things are worse now
like more racist or more sexist now
than they have been in the past you
probably have a mental problem
because everything is better
now there's nothing that's worse
literally
everything in that social realm is
better there's no exceptions
and if you think it's getting worse
instead of better you probably have
a mental problem bill maher also
blasts biden's idea of free college
because he points out rightly wait a
minute why should people who don't go to
college
or can't pay for people who do
especially when those people may be
partying more than studying
how does that make sense perfectly fair
point
so bill maher is becoming a republican
whether he likes it or not that's my
interpretation not not his of course now
i think he would
be more likely to say that he's just
looking at the issues and i think that's
fair to say
i've told you about uh the ivor mechton
saga and brett
weinstein uh had dr pierre cory on and
did a
did a podcast dark horse podcast
and it's been banned from youtube
so youtube has decided that that
conversation between a
a legitimate medical doctor who has a
legitimate opinion could be right could
be wrong
but he's a qualified person talking in
public exercising freedom of speech
but that was removed from youtube for
allegedly violating their community
guidelines
against quote spam deceptive practices
and scams um
which one it was the discussion of
ivermectin
talking about the uh risk reward
of a particular drug which everybody
agrees
has not gone through the gold standard
uh test
and everybody understands that we'd like
that that would be
way better than anything else but
everybody also agrees that there's
plenty of studies of lower quality which
by and large by a great majority seem to
point in one direction
now you can't talk about that without
violating
a rule against spam well it wasn't spam
deceptive practices
what was the deceptive practice talking
in public and showing your work
is that a deceptive practice no it's not
even close to that
is it a scam no
nobody talking on this podcast had a
financial interest in ivermectin
they were talking about it
what exactly was the guideline that they
violated well apparently the
it's still up on uh i think spotify and
probably uh apple's podcast so you can
still hear the audio of it
but youtube's decided that we can't have
that
now i will tell you that there are uh
also
professionals who say i fermectin
the science proves it doesn't work so
just be aware
that there are people with equal
qualifications
uh who say no it's been proven it
doesn't work we have everything we need
to know to know it doesn't work
at the same time other professionals
also very qualified
saying oh yeah it's totally proven i
mean effectively proven
because the the weight of evidence is so
strong so that's your experts for you
they can't really help you on this one
hey how about that arizona audit
huh i keep telling you that if you don't
hear anything from it
anything important there's probably
nothing there
because by now they would know if they
were if a problem was going to happen
apparently the results are going to come
out in less than 10 days
but we would know by now right they
don't have to count every single vote
to know that there's a problem they
wouldn't they would catch that early on
if it's a big problem it would be
obvious early you wouldn't have to wait
till the end
uh and so i asked the question about
that on twitter and
josh barnett who's i guess he's run for
congress
in arizona so he's connected to the
republicans in arizona it sounds like
and he seems to have some kind of an
inside knowledge of what's going on over
there
and i asked the question is it more than
a chain of custody problem
because there is some suggestion that
some of the mail-in ballots
were not uh documented in their chain of
custody
so that you wouldn't know if anything
happened in between the time that they
were received at the time they were
counted
but that wouldn't change the result
even if it turns out that there's a
chain of custody problem
it's not going to overthrow the election
they're still going to say well you
should have caught that earlier or
something like that
basically at this point nothing's going
to change but
i asked if that was going to be the
extent of what they found and
josh burnett tells me it is not that is
not the extent of what they
found and we'll all found out in 10 days
and he sounds
pretty confident that we'll hear
something that might surprise us
or maybe it won't surprise you we'll
find out
i'm going to be a skeptic on this until
something changes my mind so i'm going
to be skeptical and say
i don't think the arizona audit is going
to come up with a smoking gun
because i feel like i'd know it by now
all right
now if they're unusually professional
and they've kept a secret better than
anybody's ever kept a secret
except maybe the mueller report they did
a good job of keeping the secret
but of course they were also attorneys
and it's a it's a different level of
risk right
i feel like you could trust professional
attorneys and investigators a little bit
more not to leak
then you could trust a bunch of people
who volunteered to do an audit
it's a different standard i would think
of risk lawyers having a bigger risk
to their reputation um
kim jong-un is apparently losing weight
quite a bit of weight
um i dare say he looks great in his
recent
recent photos like actually it looks
great
now it's being treated as uh they don't
know if it's good health or bad health
but they're keeping an eye on it well
it looks like good health to me the the
photos of him looking
uh looking thinner he looks really
healthy so
i know i i don't think it's necessarily
good or bad news it's just interesting
he's losing weight
all right have you noticed that fox news
is running
uh non-stop uh videos of
usually people of color complaining
about critical race theory
so you're seeing that a lot on the right
do you see any of those stories on cnn
or msnbc has either msnbc
or cnn ever and maybe the answer is yes
so this is actually a question not a
statement
have they ever run one of those video
clips where there's a concerned parent
could be black could be person of color
uh some other color
uh talking in public at say a school
board meeting or wherever they're
meeting town meeting
and talking about critical race theory
being a disaster
i feel like it only is shown on one side
of the world
now beware of anecdotal evidence
so no matter how many individual stories
you see of
there's a black woman railing against
critical race theory
it doesn't mean that most people are
against it or even know what it is
really so i wouldn't make too much of
anecdote but i would note that fox news
is making a big deal of it
and cnn is not now how important would
it be
to discredit critical race theory
is it important to the health of the
country
because the news has this weird
responsibility doesn't it
the news is trying not to give you
opinion mixed with the news part
cnn doesn't try too hard to do that but
other news
does try to you know keep the news and
the opinion at least a little bit
separate
and uh
it just seems to me that maybe fox news
has decided that critical race theory is
bad for the country
and other news entities have not so one
thinks it's news and the other things
maybe not so much
but i heard a way to frame this critical
race theory
and marxism so i could understand it and
i feel like i understand it now for the
first time
and i i've told you before that i was
confused about why it is that
conservatives keep saying hey
critical race theory it's marxism
and then i keep saying and and
connect a few more dots those are two
different things
in my mind they're two different things
why are they why does one lead to
or why is it similar i don't get it so i
did hear
a good explanation of this yesterday
which is that marxism is basically
class warfare the idea that the lower
class
needs to essentially take money take it
overthrow the power of the existing
power structure the elites the rich
people
and basically flip the power structure
so that
the people are on top and nobody's rich
so that's what marxism is critical race
theory
is just another name for that because
their focus is on race but it's still a
class
because they've equated uh a race
black people with a class an underclass
now of course there are plenty of
exceptions right
but it's close enough at least for a
political movement it's
sort of generally close enough that you
can get a lot of people to say yeah yeah
let's
let's change the balance of power and
the thing you need to
um that you need to work on
is understanding are they
parallels does one lead to the other i
don't think that's the right way to
think of it
i would say that they're parallels the
marxism is class warfare
critical race theory is class warfare
with a twist
which is throwing in the race part
marxism is just exactly the same thing
except they leave out the race part
so it's a little little underpowered as
soon as you add the race part in
it's super powered so now you've got
this shitty idea
marxism which basically ruins everything
except that we've got this new brand
that's like improved it's like turbo
powered with racism
because you can't argue against racism
can you maybe you could argue that
capitalism is better than
socialism you could argue that and you'd
have plenty of evidence for it
but can you argue that black people
should always be poor
you can't you can't so that little extra
sauce
turned marxism into a more powerful
brand
critical race theory now of course
critical race theory is nothing but
racism
and a power grab but
it is on top of real things
yeah racism is real i i believe systemic
racism is very real especially the
teachers unions ruining the schools so
that people can't get a good education
if they're
lower income but i think there are real
problems
it's just that the critical race theory
on top of it isn't really
designed to solve those problems so much
as a
create a power change and maybe
maybe create a different set of victims
and a different set of winners
i think what's different about um
critical race theory
is it's not a win-win proposition by
design
right and and suppose you took this
frame
and somebody says hey we'd like to teach
critical race theory in school
and then you say you know i hear why you
want to do that
i understand your reasons but how about
we do something
that's a win-win instead of a
win lose it's hard to argue against a
win-win
and critical race theory is clearly we
win so that you lose
now their theory would be it's still
fair
it's fair for poor people to win because
the rich people have been winning up
until now
or you might change that too it's fair
for
black americans to win for a change
because white americans have been
winning for so long
but they're not trying to hide the fact
that they want to win at somebody's
expense
and as long as you have that you're
going to rip the country apart
you need to find a way that everybody
wins let me suggest away
black americans and white americans
teaming up
to fix education
what 75 of all your systemic racism
comes right from that the fact that the
schools can't give you a balanced
starting point fix that
it's where we all agree there's nobody
black who wants bad schools
or bad you know trade education there's
nobody white who wants
bad schools and yet we have them we have
bad schools
why not work on the biggest problem
education
by far the biggest problem you're
getting everybody trained to have a good
job and therefore a good life
and we when we agree on that so why
would we find the the smallest thing we
could work on
that we disagree on and focus on that
it's not important and it's a win-lose
scenario
and it ignores the important stuff it's
not even close
all right so if we were serious about
fixing
uh race problems we wouldn't be focusing
on critical race theory
that would be the wrong way to go
representative chip roy of texas is
introducing a bill
to ban china from buying property
in the u.s i think it might be focused
on texas
because he talks about texas's land but
without seeing the details
i can't tell if this is intended to be
i think he i think he intends it to be
national that's just my guess
uh i agree with this idea
because china is such a big country that
eventually even if they don't
perform as well as the united states
eventually they'll be bigger
because they just have so many people
and so much industry
so at some point they'll have so much
money that they can just
buy stuff and basically destroy the
united states by buying it
you know for all practical purposes uh
trump i guess the trump department of
justice was investigating a leak
or the leaks and i think adam schiff his
phone records were looked at
and this is pretty scary stuff so
scary the cnn brought back the worse
than watergate guy to talk about it yes
that's right
bernstein the worse than watergate guy
was taken
anamothballs and he was wheeled up to
cnn to say trump's actions go
further than nixon's he's guilty of
crimes against democracy
so carl bernstein spit and slobber all
over the desk and tells us it's
worse than watergate even when he
doesn't use the words
he's really saying worse than the
watergate so instead of saying worse
than watergate where he gets mocked
for saying worse than watergate he
simply says
trump's actions go further than nixon's
huh what did nixon do oh watergate
and trump's actions go further than
nixon's
he's worse than watergate he found
another way to say it
and that's your news
well putin and biden apparently are
not going to meet well they're going to
meet but they're not going to have a
joint
press conference afterwards why
well there's two reasons one joe biden
doesn't want to
stand next to putin and act like
putin's i guess a peer so he doesn't
want to give putin the
respect i guess or the attention or the
i don't know national stage of standing
next to him and answering questions
that's one
that's one interpretation perfectly good
one
possibly true here's another one
maybe they don't want biden to take
unscripted questions
with putin standing next to him because
if you see biden trying to struggle with
an
unscripted question and not be able to
do it
literally standing next to putin who's
handling these questions like he's
playing tennis
it's not gonna look good all right so i
think this is the right decision by
biden because he can't play in that
field he's just not he's just not
capable and so why do it
putin was asked in an interview about
biden versus trump here's what putin
said about trump
you said trump was talented colorful
he's an extraordinary individual yep
talented colorful extraordinary
individual and not part of the
establishment
here's what he said about joe biden joe
biden's been
in politics for a long time
so that's what he said about biden those
are those are all biden's good qualities
he's been in politics for a long time
feels like feels like not quite the
compliment you would have expected
feels like uh putin has a preference
sounds like putin likes his trump
not so happy about biden but
one wonders what we should think about
that should that make us like biden
better
as a president because you'd want the
person maybe that putin likes the least
or do you want somebody who could work
with putin
but maybe putin tries to take advantage
of you if you just work with him
don't know don't know but it doesn't
seem that
putin is a big fan of joe biden
and that is everything i wanted to tell
you
before i either get on a plane for an
amazing vacation
or if i get a
false positive on my coffee test which i
will know
in an hour and a half
and i'm not going anywhere
mark says please consider organizing a
donation camp uh campaign for
uh governor abbott's uh wall
that would be the texas wall that texas
is gonna try to build on its own
um huh so
uh i don't think i want to get involved
in a fundraiser for a wall
uh but uh
let me ask you this i'll leave you with
one final question
what's the difference between jeffrey
toobin
and donald trump go what is the
difference
between jeffrey toobin and donald trump
the answer is trump is
accused of stoking and insurrection
do i need to finish the rest of the joke
so you're supposed to finish
in the rest of the joke in your mind
that's how this one works
yeah the difference between jeffrey tube
and trump is that trump
is allegedly guilty of stoking
his insurrection okay okay
i see you get it thank you thank you um
the
the naughtier version is on robots read
news on locals
if you are a subscriber to locals you
will see more of my jeffrey toobin
humor because there's just so much of it
you can do
in the public domain and i may be doing
too much of it in the private domain
but nothing's funnier than jeffrey tubin
on tv i'm sorry and by the way i'm i'm
jeffrey too but not as a person
necessarily
but as a public figure who got caught
doing something dumb
that i don't think should affect his
career i'm happy that his career is back
on track
i think that's the standard we would all
want to wish upon ourselves
so let's uh wish him well and uh we'll
we'll be mad at him later when he says
things we don't like
all right and that
is what you need to know for today i
will try to do
this tomorrow but there's a time
difference there's some travel
i'm probably not going to be able to but
we'll try all right
see you soon
