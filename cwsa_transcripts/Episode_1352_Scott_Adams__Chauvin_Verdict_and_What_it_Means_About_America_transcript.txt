all right
it's time come on in come on in
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and can you make a guess what we'll be
talking about today
i think you can i think you can and if
you'd like to
enjoy it i mean really really enjoy it
like better than you've ever enjoyed
coffee with scott adams well all you
need is a cupboard mugger glass a tanker
jealous dinah canteen jugger flask a
vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee you might like racism
but don't drink that no never drink a
delicious beverage
beverage a beverage instead
and i'd like you to join me now for the
simultaneous sip go
oh that was a simultaneous gulp
yeah a little bit extra a little bit
extra
well uh everything in the world is
backwards and upside down today
have you noticed that nothing seems to
be
right today everything's just a little
bit off
and and you don't notice it until you
see all the examples but i'll give you
something as we go
uh so i'd like to give a start out with
a big damn you damn you
to uh andres backhouse
who i talk about often because he's
great on
data analysis for any of the stuff of
the news
but uh he made me retweet aaron rupar's
tweet and i can't forgive him for that
but it's the first time i've
unironically
retweeted him i think but if you don't
know who
uh aaron rupar is he's uh
he's a character who is let's say
interesting we'll just keep it at that
but uh normally i would not agree with
his uh his tweets
but here he was he was responding to
nancy pelosi's
speech after the chauvin floyd verdict
and
[Laughter]
nancy pelosi managed to reach into this
big basket
of things that you could say and managed
to pull out
the only thing that was wrong you could
have gone in
a hundred different directions and not
messed this up as badly as you did
to the point where aaron rupar is
retweeting you with condemnation
she said
thank you george floyd for giving your
life for
i'm not even going to finish it but
let's just say
in the in the history of
of politicians saying that dumb
this was this was notable like even her
own side had to well we're out
if if you're nancy pelosi
and aaron rupar is listening to you and
the first thing he says i'm out
i'm out i don't want any part of this
you've really gone off you've gone too
far
uh in other news the uh
there's a norfolk uh police lieutenant
who was fired
because it was leaked that he donated
some money to kyle rittenhouse's defense
and gave him some words of encouragement
he got fired for that
he got fired for an opinion
that was backed by the video
for a person who is presumed innocent
until proven guilty
and he got fired for it
so that's the norfolk uh police
department for you that's that's pretty
pathetic now here's the good news
if you are let's say a police union
and uh your contracts come up i'm
assuming the union does the negotiating
for the police contracts
what would you ask for in terms of a
raise
this coming round i feel like
30 would be the right number
right that doesn't mean they'll be able
to get it because there are lots of
forces pushing back
but i would say that the police unions
have a rock solid argument
that the environment of risk has changed
so substantially
that the risk reward of their job can't
be looked at the same anymore
and that on top of the physical violence
risk which was always
extreme which is why we have so much
respect for the police
they're doing stuff you and i don't want
to do for the most part
uh but i would say that given the
now the the legal and social risk on top
of the
the violence risk it looks different now
i would say i would back the cops for a
30
raise minimum and that's just based on
how society has changed the risk that
we're willing to put on the police
now i would say that before you could
argue but wait we should put this
risk on the police that's not even the
argument
so so whether you think that the floyd
trial
went just the way it should have or you
don't irrelevant
it doesn't matter any of that to my
point that the police are in a new
new situation of risk whether they
should be there or not is a separate
question
but they are there and it's different
and it's more
risk reward risk reward suggests that
police
should get i would say a minimum of 30
raise because i don't know how you could
retain them otherwise
yeah the the thing they signed up for
just doesn't exist
because the thing they signed up for is
if it was a gray area
they were probably going to get away
with it right
when i say get away with it i don't mean
that they necessarily do something wrong
i just mean that if it's a gray area and
they were trying to do their job
they probably would have gotten away
with it in the past and i guess i'm
biasing the biasing by say getting away
with it
because maybe there was nothing to get
away with
but 30 pay raise for police i think that
is called for
so i would over fund the police based on
this new situation
so whoever wanted to defund the police
probably this moved in the wrong
direction
and by the way there's no economist who
would disagree with me
right it's the same job except
way extra risk you have to pay extra for
that
that's how it works so if so if
defunding the police is what anybody
wanted
i'm pretty sure this should work the
other way if economics works the way
it's supposed to
the next door app i hear has a new
feature that'll tell you if you're being
racist
before you send your message
what do you think of that what do you
think of the next door app
before you send out a little message to
the neighbors apparently it's got some
artificial intelligence built in
that's just looking for key words such
as
blue lives matter it'll flag that that's
actually one of the examples
it'll flag it to say you know some
people would take blue lives matter as a
racist statement
are you sure you want to send it it'll
still let you send it
uh or all lives matter if you type all
lives matter into the app
it'll stop you and say woo you know
what's going on here right
it's gonna look a little racist think
twice what do you think about that
are you up for that are you down for
that
i have i have mixed opinions
i usually violate the common thinking
whenever information is presented that's
useful
so in my opinion next door is presenting
actually useful information
because there might be people who
literally don't know
that they're about to ruin their own
life by saying something that they think
is supporting you know all life and
equality
but other people are going to think
you're a racist
i don't know i think it's i think it's
worth trying
maybe see how people think about it give
it a whirl
if they were actually blocking you for
saying it then that's
another question but if it's just
information
and it's information that can save your
life literally
it's worth a try they can always reverse
it if the if the users don't like it
but anytime you can try something
cheaply
and it's got a good purpose behind it
yeah why not
give it a try it's a little creepy but
it's a test
you know everything's a test if you can
reverse it easily
all right let's talk about uh
this show of an outcome
if you didn't hear me last night i did a
live stream last night but let me recap
my opinion number one i am satisfied
with the jury's work on this
i thank the jur the jurors um
i do not think that the jury's job
is to decide the law so this is where i
might
differ with some of you i don't believe
that the jury's
duty and i use this word you know
intentionally i don't think that the
jury's duty
was to attend to the letter of the law
as instructed by the judge
that was their job description right
it's not their duty their duty under the
law
is to follow the law just you know as
best they can
so certainly if the only duty you were
talking about is what their
their legal required description of
their responsibility is
then it was their duty to follow the
letter of the law but
what is a higher l what's what's the
higher law than
the legal law the one that's written
down is there any higher law
of course there is of course there is
there's the greater good if you ever ran
into a situation where following the
letter
of the law was clearly bad for the
greater good
what would be the duty of the jury
i'm going to give you an artificial
example where the jury knows
that following the letter of the law
would just be a wrong
what's their duty is their duty to
follow that law that they know is wrong
no never their duty is to be humans
their duty is to be americans their duty
is to their fellow citizens for whom
they have taken some sacrifice
to serve on this jury now before we
before we discuss the question of
whether they handled it right
separately can we agree that their duty
is to do the best they can for the
greater good they might not get it right
but their duty is not to follow the law
if the greater good is in a different
direction
does anybody disagree with that i want
to see if there are those who would say
that they should follow the law
even if they knew the law wasn't evil
right i'm not saying that's the case in
the shelving case just as a
as a principle
a lot of people here a lot a lot of
people disagree
i will take your i will take your
disagreement
with respect meaning that
i res i respect that i respect that
point of view completely
i have complete respect for the opposite
view of mine
which is if you think that following the
law is just always going to be
better even if there's some evil in a
specific case
i can see that that's not a terrible
argument by the way because there's an
assumption built in
that following the letter of the law
gets you to a you know the
in the long run you've got a better
situation right
yeah that's that's fairly good um but i
disagree
i disagree the human law is always
higher than the
uh the real law you know the written law
in my opinion
and the problem is whether you are wise
enough to know
when to make this critical exception
and that's a problem right because maybe
humans are not wise enough to make these
exceptions
but there is a reason that we have jury
trials and it's because we're all more
comfortable with a system
in which some capable people who mean
well do the best they can
right that's as good as you can get it's
a pretty good system
and i would say the system worked in
that sense
and i do think that the jurors took into
account
their own safety which i support
i think they took into account what
would happen to
society which i would support them doing
that
and just in this specific case i think
they took into account
potential riots i think they took into
account how the police would be viewed i
think they took into account
racial animosity i think they took into
account how it
feels should they well
most of you think no but they did
because you can't not you nobody has the
ability to turn that off
it's all part of the forces so
here's what i like about the outcome i
do believe
that it was a close call in terms of
whether he was guilty of anything
versus not guilty i think that the jury
heard all of the evidence
and i didn't that's important
the jury heard all of the evidence i
didn't
most of you almost 100 of you also
didn't hear all of the evidence you
didn't live through it
so if the people who lived through it
and saw all of it
have a different feeling about it than i
got
from my little keyhole i'm not going to
say they're wrong
because the you know the the assumption
is if all 12 of them
voted the same way it's more likely that
i would have voted that way too
if i'd seen what they saw experienced
what they experienced but i didn't
right so i'm not going to second-guess
people who did the work when i didn't do
it
and when i watched anybody online who
also didn't do the work
didn't watch every minute of the trial i
don't value their opinion as much as i
value the
the jurors right and there was nothing
in the jury description which i found
actually helpful
even though it has the bad effect of
probably doxxing them
but but actually reading about the
backgrounds and the way they answered
the questions
i actually have a lot of confidence in
that group and it was
mostly white people in in the jury
who convicted a white guy which also
helps a little bit for the credibility
now did they make a wise decision well
let's look at some of the outcomes so we
don't know if it's wise
but i do feel like they were credible
and tried and here's one of the outcomes
according to axios reporting senior
democrat and republican aides
so both democrats and republicans this
is important to the story
the aides say they would have never let
their bosses say it on the record
but privately they told axios that a
guilty verdict in the chauvin trial
has lessened pressure to act on police
reform
so one of the outcomes of this verdict
is
less likely there will be police reform
because it looks like you know this was
police reform
right it made sure that people police
know not to do this
might have made a big difference but it
may not turn into legislation and we
don't know what the net of that is
so there's that we also didn't have
much in the way of riots last night i
think portland had a little action there
was a police officer who was assaulted
some windows got broken but basically
there were no riots right i mean i think
portland was just going to be portland
no matter what
but is that fair to say or
is it just not being reported i'm
looking at your comments to see if i
missed it
well i would say that is mostly peaceful
so does that mean that the uh the
outcome
was right well as i've told you it's
it feels like we can't confirm this
maybe someday we can
it feels like the jury sent a message to
the world
which is there's something wrong with
this police officer
we're going to sacrifice him
and we're going to we're going to send
you a message by making him guilty on
all counts
which even the experts didn't really
think was going to happen did they
so i think the jury is sending a message
that they're making a
let's say not according to the letter of
the law decision
i feel like that's the message could be
wrong
it could be could easily be
misinterpreting it but it feels like it
to me
so i'm just telling you what i i'm
receiving i'm not telling you what they
sent
um and it feels like
well let me tell you why i'm not um
disappointed in any way about the uh
outcome even though
with what i knew uh it would have gone
the other way
if they'd use the letter of the law but
that's just based on what i do
incomplete all right
so it seems to me that there was
something
wrong with derek shelvin
and did anybody else get that
no matter whether you thought he was
technically guilty
you know beyond a reasonable doubt no
matter
what you thought about that there was
something wrong with him wasn't there
you know how humans this has been proven
humans can actually detect if somebody
is physically ill
by looking at their face i think people
could probably detect
if people are um
i've heard this tell me if i'm wrong
you can detect if somebody is likely to
be gay
by their face not every time of course
but
better than you know the chance would
suggest
so there are a lot of things about us
that just sort of come out
you know that people can recognize
and i was trying to think yesterday what
is it about
derek shovin that bothered me and maybe
someone maybe everybody else
so much because it wasn't exactly what
he was doing
right because what he was doing there
was enough of an argument that it was
part of the policy and hadn't heard
people before and
you know maybe he didn't know how bad he
was doing it you know it was part of the
argument
but beyond the argument there was
something wrong with his
attitude or he seemed a little bit too
happy did anybody get that
like was anybody feeling somebody says
it's called prejudice
yeah of course um so we're not talking
about science here i'm talking about how
you
you felt about him did you have a bad
feeling about him i'm looking at your
comments now to see if anybody had that
i'm seeing some yeses some no's some
people signing off
because of that are you trying to
persuade
fear yet fear no
there was um i'll tell you what
what it looked like to me there was a
lack of
empathy that has gone
all the way through the trial
what should there not have been some
point
in which we heard a statement from derek
shelvin and maybe we did if
if he made the statement let me know
should derek chovin have not said at
some point
you know once he knew he was going to be
tried for it
couldn't he make a statement that says
my god i certainly didn't intend this
uh i feel sorry for the family um
i never would have done this you know
had i
been aware that the danger was so much
uh
you know something like that
no somebody says no don't do that
because it would imply guilt
but you don't have to have guilt over a
death
do you you could feel bad about the
death
without admitting guilt indeed you could
say
i feel terrible for the family i feel
you know awful about what happened
uh i hope that the the jury will show
that i wasn't a participant in
in that and because that's what i felt
at the time
would that be incriminating to simply
have
uh to simply have empathy or
remorse is the wrong word because
remorse would suggest that he did know
he did something wrong so you'd have to
be careful there
but you could have empathy right
and i feel that he didn't show it in a
way people were expecting which doesn't
mean anything he just
didn't show it the way people expected
at the moment
you know that and i think this changed a
lot of minds
apparently there was a moment when he
knew there was no heartbeat
and he didn't change his behavior if you
were on
top of somebody holding them down and
you knew that their
heart stopped beating how does that not
immediately change your behavior and i
don't think it changed his behavior
so somebody says asperger's well that
would be interesting
certainly that wasn't that would be
really interesting
if if that were even a little bit true
that would be certainly part of the
defense or part of the
part of the sentencing but i doubt it
was true we would have heard about it
anyway so i think this jury looked at a
person who had no empathy
and he was close enough to doing
something that looked like
murder that when they looked at all of
the variables
including their own safety what it would
do to society
just what feels right
i feel like the jury made the right
decision
now is that the same as saying that the
that the uh that the uh
the trial was fair i don't think it was
even close to fair
not even close but i think the jury
could have a
a right decision without the trial being
even close to fair
and that would be okay in my mind i
could hold both of those as true
but i've heard you earlier that you
couldn't and that's that's a legitimate
opinion
yeah i think it was a human sacrifice
and here's something that i think that
uh the black population of this country
doesn't fully understand and i'm gonna
i'm gonna illustrate it
by playing two parts i will now give you
a skit
in which i play a representative group
of black americans
not any specific person and a
representative person
representing white people not any one
white person
and black people say
hey you white people let's see if you
can now punish a white person
for doing something that you know maybe
there's a little argument about how bad
it was let's see if you can do that
hey white people do you think you can
punish a white person
and then the white people say sure watch
this
then the black people say i know but can
you
punish an actual white person
when the crime there's some disagreement
about the nature of the crime
do you think you can do that and the
white people say
we just said yes i don't even know why
you're asking
of course we can of course we can
we do it every day punishing other white
people
is like breathing if you're a white
person do you know how many white people
i've punished
who had it coming lots of them
every day punishing other white people
is the easiest thing we do
let me give you a story that a lot of
people didn't believe when i
i've been telling this story for years
it's completely true
but when i tell it there's a certain
percentage of you who will swear i'm
lying
trust me i've been saying it for i don't
know 25 years
since i've been able to tell the story
and
there there would be literally thousands
of witnesses
still alive who would be refuting me
because i tell this story all the time
plenty of people could refute it if it
were not true and it goes like this
when i worked for a big bank it was
crocker national bank years ago
beginning of my career my career was
going well and it looked like i'd be
sort of a management type person and my
boss called me into my office
a white woman and she said i don't know
how to tell you this
but then the word has come down from
management
that we can't promote you now or for any
time in the future that we can see
because you're white and because you're
a man
and they said the reason is that the
company was getting some heat
because there was not enough diversity
in senior management
so now you may have heard me tell the
story but here's the twist on it
who was it who screwed me
who did that was it was it black people
no no it was old white men
threw me under the bus in a heartbeat
to protect themselves because they could
keep their job
as as a senior management so long as
they screwed enough white people in
lower levels
to let people of color you know sort of
leave problem and get up to see
management now independent of whether
you think that was a good idea to have
this
reverse discrimination um not legally
but the way companies implemented it was
like that
so independent whether you think that's
a good or bad idea the only point i'm
going to make today
is that when i when when white men
were asked to destroy my life
for their convenience they didn't
hesitate
they didn't hesitate for a
second
so let me tell you black americans
if you're ever wondering will white
people
punish other white people to protect
themselves
yeah like really quickly
so the the punchline is that i moved
from that bank i i quit it almost
immediately
quit the bank moved to the phone company
where i got on the management fast track
and i was going to be
senior management in the phone company
and my boss called me in and said
i don't know how to tell you this but
the word just came down we
can't promote white people anymore
not white men anyway women maybe but we
can't promote any white men
because we got caught it's only white
people at senior management
so second company how long did it take
the white people to throw me under the
bus
one second no hesitation
if you want to kill white people ask
white people to do it
because they're really willing no
hesitation
so i think that's largely an invisible
thing
if you're imagine being a black
person in america some of you are you
don't have to imagine it at all
imagine what that would be like if the
news just kept you showing you
george floyd's situations uh black
people being abused black people being
confused
and it's greater than the percentages in
the public so
it's a real thing like a real issue
but if you don't see all the times that
white people are
are stomping on the heads of other white
people for their own benefit
you're kind of missing some context it
feels like white people are oppressing
black people
and the part you miss is that successful
white people
are just screwing everybody they're just
screwing everybody
because that's what's good for them to
keep things just the way they are
anyway that's useful context for you
right there um
do you think that the there's no rioting
because of the chauvin
verdict i feel like that's the smartest
thing they did
is to make it guilty on everything
because at least that had a chance of
averting the riots and it looks like it
worked
looks like it worked you know i said
yesterday that
um i've said this a lot that i don't
believe there's any such thing as bad
presidents and good presidents
because by the time you get elected
president you do have a certain minimum
amount of
you know talent so they all have the
minimum talent
but what makes you good or bad is just
luck
is your specific set of talents and your
personality is it
suited for the exact problems that come
up while you're president
now covet was exactly the wrong
problem for president trump
and i'm not even sure his supporters
would disagree with that
too much right it just wasn't the right
match
because optimism which was the trump
thing
optimism and the pandemic they just
didn't fit together
but optimism and the economy great
you know trump and the economy i love
that combination
optimism economics works great i feel as
if biden was exactly the right president
for this doesn't make him the right
president for other things
but for this i feel like he was exactly
the right guy
because he's boring he didn't make it
about
you know him even though he put
pressure on you know in some ways you
could argue that the politicians put
pressure on the jury
but there wasn't going to be a fair
trial anyway
so i think biden might have been
maybe exactly the right person because
he took all the
he took all the energy out of it if
there's one thing that biden can do it
sucked the energy out of a topic
and what did you need this topic to have
less energy right when i talk about
uh trump being an energy monster it's
usually in a positive sense he can take
energy and turn it into stuff
biden's like an energy sink he can just
suck the energy on the stuff
this is a topic where sucking the energy
out of it
was the right play and he pulled it off
you know by doing nothing basically um
here's an opinion worth noting mike
cernovich i was waiting to see what
he said about this i'll just read you
his uh his tweet because i
he always has good stuff to say about
this kind of thing
he said on the facts and law the chauvin
case was always a close one
i'd agree with that he could have been
properly convicted
so might have gone exactly this way no
matter what
but he did not get a fair trial as
everyone from rioters to a member of
congress to the potus
tampered with the outcome i'd agree with
that today is
one of national disgrace a true
insurrection
so his opinion is that this is a bad
outcome
because it was an unfair trial i agree
on the facts
there's no way it could have been a fair
trial here's where i would disagree on
the opinion
there wasn't a chance for a fair trial
that i i would completely agree with the
opinion
if it had been an option to have a fair
trial but that option never existed
it can't exist the story was simply too
big
and people's ability to communicate
simply too good
there wasn't really an option for a fair
trial
so given that there was no option for a
fair trial
and chauvin didn't really have the
option really
of anything like justice according to
you know the details of the law and
reasonable doubt and none of those
things really applied in my opinion
to the case i think it was emotional
social
peer pressure i think it was all those
things
but again i would say that the juror the
jurors had the hardest job in the world
they had to figure out what was the
greater good in all of this mess
because there were no good solutions
there was nothing that the jury could do
that would solve all the problems they
could only choose which problems to
keep and which problems to try to reduce
and that's only trying there were no
good
outcomes in in the sense of everybody
gets justice or anything like that
never was possible and so these jurors
again i i can't tell you how much
respect i have for this group of jurors
they reached into the hardest situation
in the world
the whole country was watching and
really in a way the whole world
because where america goes you know
affects everybody
i think they did a tremendous job and
if they didn't follow the letter of the
law i respect it because
i think they would they may have been
looking at a higher law
and that would be okay with me now we
may find out later that the
that my interpretation of the juror the
jurors is way too
way too nice and if we find that out
later i will modify my opinion
but i'm not going to make the assumption
that this group of patriotic americans
was anything but well-meaning
well-intentioned and did a good job in
the face of the impossible
that's my current position happy to
modify it if we find out later that
something's different um
all right let's see what else we got
going on
um as i say once or twice a week if
you're not following
glenn greenwald on twitter you really
have to
just stop what you're doing and just
give him a follow because watching him
spank
cnn and msnbc and the other media
for being essentially propaganda organs
is just really good entertainment and
useful
like you really need to see how often it
happens to
fully feel what's going on and nobody
does a better job than
greenwald in in spanking them so today's
example was uh
the officer sicknick story he's the
officer who was killed
well i'm sorry back up back
up back up erase everything i just said
he's
the officer who died soon after the
capital uh
insurrection or riots or what it
protests whatever you want to call
and cnn had been reporting that he'd
been killed with a fire extinguisher
you know hit in the head with it and
then they reported that the bear spray
might have killed him somehow and now we
know that
he died of natural causes it was just
sadly you know linked to that date
and how did uh cnn handle the fact that
they had been misreporting i mean it was
seriously misreporting
this story for a long time
the they kind of just glossed over it a
little bit
and greenwald is busting their balls on
it
so that's fun to see all right you want
some real fun
here's some fun rasmussen is going to be
reporting in a little bit
uh it's not out yet for the rest of you
but i gotta
get a sneak preview and they they were
asking a question about the uh
opinions about coca-cola you know co you
know the coca-cola weighed in
and complained about georgia's voting
law changes and got involved in politics
and
as you might imagine liberals and
democrats went
different directions on their feelings
about coca-cola but here's the funniest
 you've ever seen in your life all
right here's the
here's the rest and pull results to this
question
uh does the georgia voting laws and
coca-cola's response
make you more likely or less likely to
drink
coca-cola products
the gop was 52 less likely to
purchase coca-cola products that's a
pretty big deal isn't it
yeah over half of of uh
conservatives or yeah basically
conservatives
say they're less likely to drink the
product that's kind of devastating is it
you notice that you did notice
that coca-cola seemed to pull back a
little bit
and i asked i wonder if there's anything
happening with their sales
well if over half of republicans decided
they're going to drink less of these
products
coca-cola probably noticed
but here's the good part are you ready
for the good part
here's the money shot i don't think
anything's made me laugh
more than this lately
liberals are 37 percent more likely
to consume coca-cola products
they're more likely now
if coke were let's say a healthy product
this story would look really good
healthy in terms of
improved your health i'm not making any
claims about
health and products because i would get
sued
i have no evidence no evidence
that this product is bad for you but i
think i can say
it is not intended to be a a medicine
and i would imagine that dietitians
would have something to say
about the value of uh drinking coke
or diet coke they have lots of other
products of course
but those are the ones you think of
so i wonder if the gop should come out
in favor of quitting cigarettes to see
how many liberals would start smoking
because i think uh you know the
republicans are always worried
that immigration is at least the way the
democrats want to do it
is really a clever way to get more
democrat voters through immigration
oh that's your real reason isn't it but
now republicans have their own
play like that they can just come out
against anything that's bad for you
democrats will immediately do more of
the things that are bad for them and
will kill them
and then there will be fewer democrats
i'm just saying it's a strategy that
would work it's working right now
because they apparently they convinced
they convinced democrats
to drink more sugar water
i mean seriously is that not funny
okay
somebody said
[Laughter]
that's so bad i'm going to repeat it
somebody else said this
this is not my idea i'm just looking at
it in the comments somebody said that
republicans are already doing that with
abortion
by being opposed to abortion it's making
democrats support them
abort their own babies
that's not funny except it kind of is
here's how the ap is reporting a story
that you probably heard about
so this is their tweet their exact words
police
shot and killed a teenage black girl in
columbus ohio
just as the verdict was being announced
in the trial for the killing of george
floyd
oh my god police are terrible
aren't they i mean just listen to this
police shot and killed a teenage girl
just as the verdict was announced in the
floyd tribe it's just going from bad to
worse
the police just killing this teenage
girl
oh there's more to it body cam footage
appeared to show the girl attempting to
stab two people with a knife while she
was in the act
oh feels like that could have been the
the lead sentence
here's another way this headline could
have run instead of police shot and
killed a teenage black girl
another way i could have gone is police
saved the life
of a black girl by quick action
just as the verdict for the george floyd
thing was being read
both of those are true if you see the
body cam by the way
who knows how what a jury will say but
the body cam shows a police officer
doing some of the best police work i've
ever seen
because if you didn't see the video it
was uh
one young woman getting with a knife
in the act getting ready to stab another
woman who was you know defensively
trying to protect herself and as the
knife was coming down
a police officer with a pistol you know
not
not a rifle with a sight from a fairly
good distance
took out the took out the knife woman
without hurting the potential victim
that was really good police work wasn't
it
yeah like i'd hate to see that i hate to
say there's anything
called a good shooting but that was as
good as shooting as you can
get it saved the life in real time and
it was really tight
and he acted quickly took let me let me
put this in another perspective
especially
what kind of risk did that police
officer take
for himself huge
huge that was somebody who in a moment
with no time to think took a gigantic
risk
of his whole life that police officer
you know because we know the george
floyd thing is changing how people sing
things
he took the risk of his own life to save
a young black woman who is in at any
moment was going to be stabbed to death
he took he took that chance his own
chance
that's what happened and but it's
reported as
police shot and killed a teenage black
girl just as the floyd
verdict was being read propaganda people
it's
propaganda uh here's a provocative
thought
you've seen on facebook and other places
that it's pretty easy now
technologically to replace the face
of anybody on a video right you've all
seen it right you've all seen the
examples
it's no big deal to replace somebody's
face suppose
you could you got to the point where you
could replace it so well and i think
we're kind of there
where you couldn't tell that that a face
had been replaced by another face
and then imagine that you use that
technology to reverse
the ethnicities on any video crime
so that if you see the police attacking
or you know
or in a conflict with somebody it just
automatically reverses their ethnicities
but everything else stays the same
and then you you play for the jury
the reversed ethnicities and you never
show them the original
would you get the same verdict of course
you wouldn't
not every time sometimes you would if
the if the facts are clear
but no it would change things for sure
and
what if you did that face swap let's say
you wait 10 years until there's
some college students who have never
heard of george floyd
i don't know if that's possible but you
wait 10 years and you run the entire
trial
by this bunch of students by just
reversing the ethnicities with the
and by then maybe the the culture is
different things are different
and just see if you get the same verdict
somebody says they already race swapped
george zimmerman
i'm not sure what you mean by that
but think about the fact that this is
now a technology that actually works
uh that would be interesting so
fox news is interesting uh about the
verdict on the
floyd chauvin case uh so apparently
hannity
is backing the jury and says it was a
good result
not too far from my own opinion although
i'm not sure the facts of the case
exactly supported it but i like the
outcomes
whereas tucker carlson is talking about
the
the trial being unfair i think i think
i i like the fact that these opinions
are different
i just like that fact you know
independent of whether i agree with them
it's just healthy that they're not in
the same page
remember i told you i think i told you
that
i'm waiting for the j j vaccine that's
the one i want
it's the only one banned at least in the
united states or maybe there's another
one bad
but they're looking into the these rare
blood clots
and that's why the j j vaccine the only
one that is one shot
and one of the ones that uses existing
technology instead of the mrna stuff
and here's what a blood clotting expert
says about this
so here are the actual odds and by the
way
compliments to cnn
compliments to cnn weird huh
cnn actually did an opinion piece
in which they showed the math
and they did a cost-benefit analysis
what what
how often have you ever seen that when
was last time you saw cnn report a story
with like a proper
cost benefit analysis so you can see
both sides
it's really rare so when it happened
good job cnn in fact this should have
been on fox news
so cnn i'm going to give you an a plus
for what i'm going to read right now
for the just the way they handled this
story so this is a blood clotting expert
talking about the j j vaccine that says
quote
the chances of you being um oh wait back
up
the chances of getting what we are
calling
vaccine induced immune thrombotic
i think i pronounced that correctly or
vitt is one in a million all right so
let's just call it blood clots
so the chance of getting a blood clot
from this vaccine is one in a million
hold that number in your head
the chances of being hospitalized with
covid
is roughly one in 100 for the adult
population
and the chances of having a blood clot
once you are hospitalized
is probably one in five or one in six
and a little more it's like one in three
if you're in the icu
so put those benefits to put those
numbers together
uh a one in a million chance that the
vaccine
gives you a blood clot but there's a 1
in 100 chance
that if you get the covet you're going
to be
that you've got a 1 in 6 chance of
getting it
now the math is too much to do the you
know direct direct
but i think you can see just from the
magnitude
that we're not talking about more risk
from the vaccine
we're talking about lower risk if this
is the only way to get the vaccine
now to be fair the real comparison
should have been getting this vaccine
versus the other vaccine so
uh if i'm being fair i think i have to
knock their a plus down to a maybe a c
plus as i'm thinking about it because
they did the wrong comparison so if you
had enough
vaccines so everybody could get one
why not get rid of this one risk that
doesn't seem to be the case
with the other vaccines but
do you really know the risk with the
other vaccines because they're the new
technology
maybe they're a risk later and you don't
know
so that's got to be in there and what
about the risk that you
don't get the coven at all so this risk
of 1 in 100 being hospitalized that's
only if they get it
but you have to multiply that by you
know or you have to factor in what are
the odds of getting it in the first
place which is not in here
so i'll at least give them credit for
waving their arms at the magnitudes
and i think they got the magnitudes
right the risk
is really low and especially since i'm
male
and it seems that the risk is more for
females for this j
j i'm really waiting for this one to
come available
because this is the one i would run to
like i
at the moment i'm i'm sort of waiting
for the
availability to get better i just talked
to somebody who got the shot in my area
how long do you think somebody had to
wait in their car
to get a vaccination in my area take a
guess
how long do somebody just wait in
northern california
to get the vaccination five hours
five hours in a car
waiting for the vaccination i'm not
gonna wait five hours in my car for a
vaccination
you're gonna have to get a little better
than that so if this j vaccine
becomes uh back uh back in availability
i'm hoping that one will have a shorter
line if you know what i mean
so i'm going to be all over that one i
hope that that one
comes through um
let me give you an update on the dilbert
nft if you know what they are they're
it's digital art
that's tied to the blockchain and so the
blockchain tells you that you have the
one and only original
and so there's dilbert nft two of them
one with clean
clean punchline and one with the f word
and the punch line
and i just wanted to give you the the
current number is
the one with the f word is selling for
or at least the auction number so far
is 10 times as much as the clean one so
in terms of collectibility
the naughty one is ten times more
valuable the real
bidding won't happen until the last day
of the auction so you can't really tell
what it'll go for
now but if i think it's may 1st is the
last day of the auction
but the naughty ones up to 12 000
and uh there's not really a strong
reason for anybody to bid until it gets
close to the last day
so we'll see see where that goes um
somebody was accusing me of being a
grifter
for being in this nft market
let me talk about the definition of a
grifter
if you're doing something where you're
trying to fool somebody into believing
something that's not true
you might be a grifter if you tell them
exactly what you're doing
and show your work with full
transparency
that could never be grifting right
so i'm saying in the comments you're
saying tulips for sale
grifter all right does anybody argue
with the point
that as long as you're fully transparent
you couldn't be grifting because there's
nothing hidden
right nor is there anything especially
persuasive
it's not there's not even anything
manipulative to it so
the cartoon itself the one that is the
nft
literally says the nfts don't have any
value
that's the topic of the cartoon and when
i talk about it i tell you there's no
reason to own one
but people collect things for whatever
reason so i'm not going to stop them
i'm making it available yeah so
so look at the names that people are
calling me huckster
tulips now
you have to examine yourself don't you
because what it feels like
i can't read your mind but what it feels
like is people being
angry that i could make money on this
doesn't it feel like that's the that's
all that's going on
because remember we're a free country
i've completely shown my work
i've told you there's no reason to buy
it i told you
there's no reason to buy it i don't
think i can be
more transparent than that
right but still people have that feeling
that
you don't like other people to succeed
there is a theory that what makes
democrats and
republicans different is how happy you
are for somebody else's success
let's test that when i see that people
uh are successful i i can definitely
feel
like pangs of jealousy if they did
something i didn't do
or if somebody's a billionaire and i'm
not a billionaire
i can feel it a little bit of i wish i
had that
but i'm always happy for them i mean you
could be jealous and happy at the same
time
so uh how do you feel
when people are successful around you so
that's my question
in the comments tell me how you feel
when you hear that somebody else has
succeeded in a big way
do you feel happy or does it bother you
a little bit
and you feel like uh i don't think the
way they did it
is good or i think they must have stolen
something or there must be something
wrong or
something somebody says inspired
here's a so brock
just nick says he would feel inspired by
somebody else successful
that my friends is a winning attitude
if you're feeling about other people's
success is
wow maybe i can do that too
then you are in good shape if you're
feeling about somebody else's successes
they probably stole it they didn't
deserve it
they're grifting they're they're
hucksters
you're gonna fail you're gonna fail it's
almost
you could almost predict it in fact if
you were doing job interviews
and you gave me a choice of just
throwing away people's resumes so i
don't even know what their experience is
but they could just answer a few
questions how do you feel about this
um you couldn't get an honest answer but
imagine you could get an honest answer
i feel the way they would answer a few
questions about other people's success
and about their own ability to be
successful you know that they have
agency
and the ability to be successful i feel
like that would tell me everything i
needed
because if somebody comes in and says um
i believe that my success is entirely up
to me
what do you think they've done up to
that point they probably worked really
hard
to build a set of talents go to school
stay out of jail
because you know that's their philosophy
of course they were following it if you
believe that's their philosophy
so i feel like you could you could boil
down
somebody's entire uh economic value
you know within capitalism their entire
economic value could be predicted almost
entirely
by that attitude whether they think that
their hard work is what makes them
successful
or is mostly about race and luck and who
who you were born to
and who you know and all that some stuff
jay says sometimes scott really is truly
a boomer
all right jay i'm gonna uh i'm gonna
uh i'm gonna erase you
because probably the most uh
bankrupt opinion the most empty opinion
that you could ever say is somebody's
acting like a boomer
you're acting like a boomer now
sometimes that's funny
like there's a context when it's funny
because you recognize oh yeah that is a
boomer thing
and i think those are funny too because
i i do recognize how many how often i
fall into you know the the stereotype
but here's the thing
you're just being useless right
just throwing me into a group it's just
the most useless thing you could do
and you need to go examine your life
because if you thought that was a good
comment and one that the
society needed or somehow helping you or
entertained you there's just something
wrong with you
right just something wrong with you
yeah if if tying me into a category
is somehow important to you if that was
a priority
like that's what you thought oh this
will be important let me let me tie him
to a category
why the really what good was that
here here here's another idiot i'm gonna
call out just the idiots today
or rustic says in all caps
scott has thin skin question mark
has anybody paid attention to anything
i've done for the last five years
if there's anything i don't have it's
thin skin
you don't do this job if you have thin
skin
you i couldn't possibly wake up in the
morning and do what i do
day after day with just withering
uh you should see my you should see the
messages i get every day
every day i get more criticism than you
will ever get
in your whole worthless life
and i don't think i've ever gone to
sleep feeling bad about it not once
now if you can't tell the difference
between
thick skin and thin skin you are so far
from understanding
anything about your world
and i feel sorry for you some of this is
genetic
i think i think maybe so a lot of it is
practiced
but it's hard to sort out how much is
practice and
you know a skill to be thick-skinned
and how much is natural then why are you
angry now
do i seem angry
you haven't seen me angry maybe half
but um i try really hard to
not be angry because you don't want to
see me angry
that that that's a level that i'm pretty
sure you've never seen on video
but you don't want to see that and this
isn't that
this is a condemnation let's say
i'm condemning you because i think it's
good for life
there should be less of you
it's good for the world it's good for
the world if people like you are slapped
down
the the people who are just bad bad for
the world
and don't have anything useful to say
they should be slapped down
uh
yeah i one of the reasons um somebody
was asking me yesterday if i've ever
been in a fight
like a physical fight and i've been in
physical altercations but usually i was
just beating somebody up
not usually that the only times it's
happened i was just beating the hell out
of somebody
now in both of those cases they were
bullies who had been my bully
and i just reached a level where i
needed to just beat the out of them
in front of other people to make the
problem go away and
which works wonderfully by the way i
don't recommend it
in 2021 you'll just go to jail if you
beat somebody up
but back when i was a kid if you just
beat the out of somebody
in front of witnesses it would solve
your bully problem
pretty well but i've noticed that
neither the bullies fought back
they just took it and i've noticed that
not once in my entire life
has anybody like been in a physical
confrontation with me that turned into a
fight
and i've always wondered about that
because
in the comments by the way those of you
who are male
how many fights have you been in it's
not zero
is it it's not zero but i would say i've
been in zero
fights where the other person is
fighting back
i think zero yeah look at the numbers
that that's what it's like to be a man
a man in america or anybody any place i
guess look at the number of fights
they've been in
fifteen fifty two one
three zero
i don't know how you did that but okay
uh
and i've always wondered if that's
because i look scary to other people
because i've always thought the scariest
the scariest thing you could encounter
is somebody who's not afraid of you
that's the scariest thing because if you
get in the fight with somebody
who's who's not going to ever quit
and is not going to run away and is
going to finish you off
you don't want to be in that fight right
and it doesn't even matter if like
physically you have more
skills or whatever you just don't want
to get in a fight with anybody
who's not going to ever quit and
my view is there are only two kinds of
fights that are worth having
you know one is the one you know you're
going to win
that's worth having and if it looks like
you're going to lose you should run away
and then come back and kill the person
when they're not looking
if it was worth fighting in the first
place so i would never get in a fight
unless it was worth killing somebody
which is probably why i've never been in
the
proper fight if it's not worth killing
somebody i'm not even going to get
involved
and if it is worth killing them and they
start winning
i'm going to run away and then come back
and kill them when they're not looking
that's my philosophy if somebody's worth
killing
it's worth waiting it's worth waiting
so if there's anybody out there who's
done anything to me that
they think is worthy of me killing them
just know that if it hasn't happened yet
doesn't mean it won't i'm willing to
wait
as long as it takes
you can't tell if i'm kidding and that's
good
if we've learned anything from president
trump it was that
unpredictability is a natural advantage
so as long as you don't know that's to
my benefit
getting closer to being cancelled are
you
uh are you tall no i'm not tall
which is a good question because if
you're big people don't want to get in a
fight with you
somebody says what he says aspergers is
a talent stack
creator we have to learn more than
others to fit in
well woody uh that's true
that's true yeah
the the one of the national
assets we have in this country is all
the asperger's types
because it's it's the strangest
condition if you will which is it's very
difficult for the persons who have it
like it creates extra challenges
socially etc
but they're sort of national assets like
you know who is it that's inventing all
the technology who's
you know there's just stuff that the
asperger's people are doing for america
and for the world
that's just insanely valuable
only losers hate when other people make
money
how many of you are uh by the way i i
know from history that i attract a lot
of asperger types
for my content how many of you are on
the spectrum
this will be interesting so take a take
a second for the comments to come in
how many of you watching this right now
are on the spectrum
now wait wait do you see this you're
going to be surprised
uh here it comes i am yup
nope yes not me my wife says i am
yes my son is not officially maybe
my kid is my husband barely on it yes
yes
nope me me me me open up nope
uh crikey maybe i think my husband could
be
could be i suspect i am never diagnosed
but i think i am
yeppers
are you impressed there's
probably no group that i attract to my
content
more reliably than than the asperger's
folks
look at these comments this is blowing
your way isn't it
because think about the percentage and
the population in general and then look
at my comments
yeah it's filled with them now part of
it is
somebody asked me the question in the
comments if i'm aspergers or if i'm on
the spectrum and the answer is i don't
quite know
i don't quite know because it's it's not
exactly well defined is it
my personal opinion is maybe not
but if i am i'd be sort of on the i
don't know at one end of the scale
a little bit maybe i don't know i feel
not
but i feel like i'm close enough that i
you know i i feel like i'm within
breathing distance of it
meaning that i'm so compatible with it
it would be hard to imagine i'm not
on the spectrum is that a thing
being compatible with the spectrum
without being on it
i don't know if that's even a thing
identify oh somebody says my
conversation is too good yeah you know
there's all kinds of difference
different functionality
uh but i would imagine i'm not but i
don't know
um
gates here all right
so that's all for now and i will talk to
you all
tomorrow and
um yeah it is interesting isn't it
it is interesting that'll give you
something to think about
think about why there are so many
people on the spectrum who follow my
content
and when you figure that out um
it's going to be interesting i'll give
you my hypothesis
well a couple hypothesis one of course
is that i make the dilbert comic and you
can imagine easily that dilbert's on the
spectrum
and i draw i make it that way so you
know i've got that natural
compatibility but also i try to remove
the
the emotion from decisions which i
believe
is quite compatible if you're on the
spectrum
because you'll you like to see the
emotions stripped out so you can see
what's left
and then i could add it back in and then
people can see the whole structure
so i think that's what's going on but i
don't know
so that's all i got for now i'll talk to
you tomorrow
