good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
coffee with scott adams there's really
nothing better in the world and if
anybody tells you there is well they're
lying
and you should
you should distance yourself from them
immediately
how would you like to take it up to a
new level
a new level of awareness
i call it the caffeine level and all you
need is a cup or a mug or a glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any guide
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope meaning of the day the
thing makes
everything better everything
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it set your court bustles on fire
in a good way in a good way
go
oh
so good that's so good
well today we can play our uh
our normal guessing game
on top of the content that you're about
to hear the guessing game is
how high is scott right now
so you can deal with that on your own
while i talk about the news
all right talk among yourselves
um number one why is twitter slandering
me and by that i don't mean people on
twitter
i mean twitter the company
i actually got slandered by twitter
today
now i think it's you know just an
automatic program
but what happens is i i block the guy
for mischaracterizing my opinion in
public that's that's my first
my first blocking criteria
if you scream that my opinion is
something crazy that is not my opinion
and then you criticize me i'm not going
to stop to correct you in your wrong
thinking i'm just going to block you
because have you ever have you ever
experienced somebody who
mischaracterizes your opinion
and then argues about it and then you
say oh hold on
that's actually not my opinion
you're mischaracterizing it so now when
i've presented my opinion in its
accurate form
i would expect you now to modify your
opinion
to respond to my actual opinion
now something that you're hallucinating
what happens when you do that
what happens when you correct somebody
say no no that's actually not my opinion
what do they do
do they do they do they say this they
say oh wow
yeah i guess i was wrong
no do you know what they do
they tell you your opinion
yes
i'll say you know i
i think gas prices are too high
and then somebody on twitter will say
well why did you say
yesterday they're too low
and i'll say
that never happened
that never happened at all i've always
thought they're too high
and then what does the troll do
oh yeah you did yeah you did
oh yeah you did they'll actually tell
you your opinion
and they'll tell you you're wrong
about your own opinion
meaning that you don't know your own
opinion but they do
not only do they know it but it's stupid
and they're going to show you why
so no you can't really fix
somebody who's misstating your opinion
you just have to get them out of your
life as quickly as possible
but when you do that there's some kind
of weird twitter bug
that presents a notice so if people want
to see
because i i blocked him and then i
retweeted
so that the rest of you can see why i
blocked it
the only person who wouldn't be able to
see it
in my view of how things should work
should have been the person i blocked
but the rest of you should have been
able to see a fine
but twitter puts up a notice that says
that uh the i it names me uh limits who
can see his tweets
do i
do do i limit who can see my tweets i
mean other than blocking which of course
is built into the system i'm not really
limiting who can see my tweets
but the notice goes up there and doesn't
that make me look like an
because if you when i when i've seen
that notice on other people's accounts
which i have seen do you know what's the
first thing i think
you
well it's a public forum why why would
you like
pre-block some big group of people
you've never even interacted with why
would you do that and the answer is they
didn't
they didn't it looks like it because
twitter puts that notice on it so now
there's going to be a whole bunch of
people
who think that i limit who can see my
tweets and what will be their first
reaction about me
my
i want an what's the point of
going on twitter if you get a limit who
sees your tweets
right
so i believe i've been slandered by
twitter i mean accidentally by by a bug
but they need to fix that
elon musk
put that on your list please when you're
not you know conquering other planets
and stuff like that
um
sometimes there's a story in the news
that's so
perfect and delicious
that you just want to read it
twice so i might i might just repeat
myself because sometimes it's just too
delicious you have to say it twice
and the story is about uh green day the
band
the front man named billy joe armstrong
and he told fans at a concert that
because of the roe vs wade decision
he's going to renounce his american
citizenship and
and move i guess
now here's the part that people pointed
out and the babylon bee was the first
one to make this observation which is
great by the way you should follow the
babylon b if they were on twitter you
could do it but they're still on
instagram i guess
and
here's what's beautiful
green day is famous for one song more
than others
and that song is american idiot
it's about how americans basically were
idiots and
you know don't understand what's going
on
now here's my problem if you wrote the
song and you're famous for writing a
song american idiot
and you find that your situation here in
the united states is no longer bearable
which part should you change
the american part or the idiot part
well he's decided to change the american
part
if you don't want to be an american
idiot
change the american part
be a canadian idiot i guess
and so
you know obviously that's that's not a
characterization of his thinking
but it is pretty funny
it is pretty funny it reminded me of a
joke that i i saw again
all right
so
this is a little uh inside tip on humor
writing
you probably didn't know this
there are only 100 jokes
maybe fewer i don't know
but
there are no more than 100 jokes
ever
everything is just a repeat of the same
hundred jokes
or fewer it might be a few dozen jokes
actually
but all you do is you change the names
in the situations
so this american idiot joke is where the
uh the the reason this works
you know where i i joke well if you if
your problem is you're an american idiot
why did you change the american part
right because
the joke is that there are two things
that are possible but your attention was
driven to one of them
that's how the joke works so that's one
of the joke forms all right now here's
norm mcdonald's joke
i want you want to see if you can find
that it's part of that
joke class all right
i may have ruined it by tipping you off
about how it works so norm tells this
joke or he told on conan o'brien
he said my wife she went in a coma
now i don't i assume that wasn't true
just a story but norman goes yeah my
wife was in a coma
doctors couldn't figure out what to do
but they had a theory
doctor comes to me says you know
i think there might be some amount of
stimulation that would maybe take her
out of the coma
and doctor says uh
you know i think you should try oral sex
and norm says oral sex he goes yeah i
might
might take her out of the coma
so norm says all right so norm goes in
the room with his wife is in a coma
comes out a few minutes later and he
says doctor
yeah i tried
i don't think it's working
she's choking
i'm just waiting here for a response
because you know you should be laughing
at home you should be laughing at home
that's what should be happening
now you see it's the same joke
because your your mind is automatically
taken to the more obvious that he would
be performing it
but the joke is that he didn't take the
obvious he took the non-obvious solution
same with american idiot
the joke is well if you're an idiot
change the american part it's it's
making you
not see where the joke is going until
that last that last moment that's what
makes it work
all right there was a study that was
reproduced
which i guess is noteworthy because
studies are often not reproducible
but it was uh apparently there was a
landmark
psychology experiment from years ago
which they've now reproduced and they
got the same result so maybe it was
valid it was that you could easily
induce people to believe
that when they were young they got once
got lost in a shopping mile mall as a
child
so i think what they do is they have
them talk about it or write about it or
basically deal with the issue of
being lost in the shopping mall and
simply making people sort of deal with
the topic
causes 25 of them to have a false memory
that they themselves were lost in the
shopping mall
now
do you believe it's that easy
do you believe that you could give 25
percent of the public a false memory
just by having them interact on the
topic
if you were a hypnotist you would
if you're a hypnotist you'd say yeah
that's just sort of normal business
right if you're not a hypnotist you
probably it probably blows your mind
it's like what
okay you're you're getting ahead of me
yeah hypnosis could probably give you
100
false memories
you know not 100 but it'd be closer to
100
yeah i have to just going to give you
all the false memories you want you want
some false memories
i can give you something
i mean i literally have that skill i
could give you a false memory
is that
to know that i have that ability i can
give you a false memory like
intentionally
yeah i could do that in fact i've done
it
i've actually done it extensively
intentionally giving people false
memories
yup i've done that
it was in the context of uh
hypnosis when i was reverting somebody
to their prior life
prior lives aren't real
but they remembered them
thanks to me
thanks to me i caused them a bunch of
false memories about
lives they never lent
so yeah it's really easy to give
somebody a false memory
but i was interested in the percentage
of people who were easily
triggered into the false memory it was
exactly 25
so 25 percent of people
have such little control over their own
mind
that they can be triggered into
believing something isn't true
just by talking about it
just by talking about it that's all it
takes
25
25
exactly a quarter
25
that's an inside joke for those of you
who do
all right uh rasmus and hezboll says 52
of people
who answered the poll in america are
pro-choice
is that about what you thought
i'm not sure i knew what the number was
i thought it was roughly
kind of even but did you know
52 are pro-choice there's slightly more
people who would
uh are opposed to the roe versus wade
decision i guess
somebody says people think it's bigger
well and then further rasmussen poll
says if 50 of those polled
approve of the supreme court decision
so that
sounds about right right half of the
people are pro-choice that means half of
the people are the opposite
and so half of the people agreed with
the supreme court
so
it's good to know what those numbers are
now
have you been somewhat puzzled by the
fact that i'm not
um
let's see i'm not trying to persuade you
which is the right way to go on abortion
i've told you why it's because i have a
penis and i think women should just
handle this and let us know what they
did
handle it both
personally but also handle it in terms
of what the law should be the law of the
land i just think women should take the
lead on that
and
while i retain all of my
constitutional rights i mean i still can
vote still can speak in public anytime i
want about it if i want i just choose
to be you know less important on this
topic but part of the reason that i
choose that is that it's a it's a jump
ball
the united states is 50 50
ish
and
i don't know we live in sort of a you
know republic with republi with you know
democratic processes it's hard for me to
get worked up
over something that half of the country
wants
like even if i'm on the other side
do you ever do you ever feel that you
could have a strong feeling about it but
you say you know
i live in a country where half of the
people
half
want the other thing
and it really is subjective you know we
we like to argue about it like it's you
know it's science you know life starts
here so i'm right or life doesn't start
here so i'm right but it really is
subjective it's how you feel about it
and if half of the country feels
strongly the other way
i don't know
if ethically or morally you really have
a strong impulse to argue that because
it's either way half the people get what
they want
right
so i realize this is more life and death
so it's a little different but
i just generally am not
too worked up over things that the
public is mixed about the stuff that
gets me mad is if 80 of the public wants
something
that they understand
and and the government won't give it to
them now that makes me crazy
right so
you know a lot of the basque mandate
stuff
that was where the government was not
giving the people what they wanted and
that makes me crazy
all right here's some race baiting from
uh cnn
in a
uh our opinion piece by nichola terry
ellis
uh
and the
title for the piece was as inflation
soars
black americans bear the brunt of rising
grocery gas and housing prices now why
is that that black people are bearing
the brunt
of inflation
why do black people get hit by inflation
extra bad
the reason given is because
they start on average at a lower income
level
and the lower income levels of people
getting hit
but
isn't this only a story about low income
there was no
there was nothing that
sort of tied it back to race
except if you want to say that systemic
racism
causes cause black people to have lower
incomes on average
which is true
but
especially because of the school systems
but you really have to try pretty hard
to make this a race story don't you
if you start with the the assumption
that there are more black people as a
percentage
who have low economic situation
you've kind of already agreed that
everything that happens bad to poor
people is going to get the worse i'm not
sure that's a story
shouldn't the story be
inflation is really bad for poor people
like why why do white poor people just
get left out of the mix because i'm
pretty sure they're bearing the brunt of
rising prices it's the same as everybody
else
to me this is like
this is just cnn uh in in my opinion and
this is sort of my advice
feedback to their uh new leader who
wants them to be less
less provocative and more neutral about
the news i think this is a failure
this is a failure i think for cnn to
be on their mission to be more objective
this is just propaganda narrative
and i understand this opinion
but when cnn chooses an opinion to put
on their site
they're saying it has merit and this
doesn't it doesn't have merit it's a
true fact
it's a true fact that it's hitting black
people harder
but it's the wrong frame the frame is
it's poor people harder
i just don't get how this is about black
people you just have to you have to
really push pretty hard to make this
racial
all right
[Music]
do you think it's uh consistent that you
can say
you don't like the january 6 protests
the violent part of it you don't like it
and at the same time you don't like the
january 6 hearings
could that be consistent
it is right
you can hate both of them
why not and i had a few observations
about this number one
the the protesters on january 6
i characterized them this way
they smelled something fishy
and they wanted to
the government to pause just long enough
to check out the fishy part
before certified
now of course there were lots of people
there so not every person wanted the
same thing
some people were just bad people who
wanted violence and probably didn't want
to hurt people some of them
but they weren't the majority you know
the majority was there
because their instincts and i'm going to
call it instincts
were that the election looked obviously
rigged
like obviously
now i'm not saying it was rigged because
i haven't seen evidence to support that
but my instinct
had some of the same
you know inklings
meaning i thought
i don't know
there's something about this
that isn't quite registering as
copacetic
which doesn't mean it isn't
just means that what i expected didn't
happen right so anytime your
expectations are violated the first
thing you do is
who's up to something
doesn't mean somebody's up to something
uh just means it could be
so
uh here's what i think happened
ironically i believe that the january 6
protesters were reacting to the fact
that it feels like our systems are are
rigged
does that sound like a fair
characterization i'll say it again
as an average you know now we're
accepting that some members were just
violent
crazy people right well i'm not
discounting that they have to be dealt
with
but the general protesters
when you say that they had an instinct
that something was wrong
and that they were there to protect the
the republic
don't you think that was their mindset
their instinct was something wrong
and they went there to protect the
republican i said this before
but i'll i will die on this hill i i
will die on this hill
there's no republican who would protest
a fair election
i would die on the hill you can shoot me
a thousand times and torture me
i'm i'm not gonna change that opinion
no republican
protests
a fair election
it's not who they are
right it's not who they are it's
literally the opposite of who
they are and it makes me mad
to watch the democrats paint the
republicans as
the opposite of who they are
the opposite
now it'd be one thing to say
oh you're you know you robbed a bank or
something like some crazy allegation
but to say somebody's the opposite of
who they are
that gets right down to your dna level
insult doesn't it
like it's one thing to say oh i think
you
you know you stole an apple from the
stores like no i didn't i mean that'd be
bad to be accused of that but it's
really bad
let's say if you were
let's say you'd worked all your life
to solve some problem and then somebody
says you're the cause of the problem and
that would really hurt wouldn't it
it's like the worst thing you could say
to somebody is that you're the opposite
of who you are
right so
why why did the trans community get all
worked up when people mischaracterize
them
because when you're talking about
mischaracterizing some of these you know
gender
i don't know what what words you want to
put on it
you're talking about their basic being
right
so do you understand why the trans
community
is uh let's say
let's say famously
reactive
if they get mocked or in any way
disrespected
you can see it right
because what you're talking about is
really just the most basic part of who
they think they are now you could argue
that they shouldn't think that but it's
not up to you
so when you tell a republican that
they're not a republican
and you put them in jail for not being
republican enough
or you know that's an exaggeration but
you demonize them for not being
republican enough
republicans would protect the system and
bolster it
that's what they were trying to do and
they got characterized as people
destroying the system they were trying
to protect that's just
that's like psychological
i don't know it's almost like a
psychological crime
to to define somebody's opposite of who
they are just like trans
right i don't usually don't like
analogies but i just fell in love with
this one as i was doing it
you can understand why the trans
community is so active
don't doubt
and by the way i'm not saying who's
right or wrong
i'm just saying that if you're trans
it's your decision who you are
it's your decision
right
it's your decision and yes yes we on the
sidelines can say i think you made the
wrong decision
because everybody gets an opinion right
but it's not my decision
it's their decision
and
let me let me divert for a while
i've seen some critics say that
especially
with children making decisions early on
that they're making the wrong decisions
and it's destroying their lives
i would agree
that there must be cases where people
made the wrong decision
everybody on the same page there must be
there must be cases where people made
the wrong decision and wouldn't we as
good people
wish that that had not happened
probably
and also wouldn't we as good people if
we saw it developing
wouldn't we want to nip it in the body
so that somebody doesn't hurt themselves
unnecessarily of course we would because
we're good people
unfortunately
that whole thing about us being good
people isn't the ruling
you know the ruling ethical
moral
principle in this country
the higher principle is it's not up to
you
it's not up to you that's the higher
principle and i appreciate that higher
principle
and i'm going to give you some extra
context
forget about the trans stuff
every kid is making decisions that are
destroying their lives they're all doing
it
and the adults do
and to to
to uh identify the trans community as
like the special ones making bad
decisions to me that
that doesn't feel right
because what i see is everybody making
bad decisions all the time
all the time
every time some kid you know does drugs
anytime some
parent you know managers
wrongs
you know they're just tons and tons of
entirely life-destroying decisions that
people are making let me give you an
example
there there was once a uh a young person
who is trying to decide whether to take
french or spanish
in school
i said well one of them is really really
useful spanish one of them is a complete
waste of time
french
what did the young person choose
french
french
and did the young person regret it
greatly later yes
because spanish would have been really
useful
french complete waste of time
so yeah every single day i'm watching
people young people children
making decisions that are
majorly impacting their future
some people are uh
well i'll take it out of the analogy
phase that's a good point somebody said
analogies
are useless i can do this without the
analogy
if people make bad decisions
you have to let them that's our system
and the the trans issue
those are if you made it wrong like if
you made it wrong would be really bad
but there's a lot of wrong decision
making that we don't go after
because we appreciate the freedom over
that
so i just put it in context
um
and uh that was the point
somehow i completely missed the point i
was going to make
let me let me get back to the point
in my opinion the january 6 hearings
validate the instincts of the protesters
the protesters
believed that the system was rigged
and that it was rigged right in front of
them
right in an obvious way
and that the system said to them
let's see let's see what you do about
that
let's see you do anything about it we're
going to do this right to you
right in front of you
and then there's nothing you could do
about it
now again i'm not saying the election
was
rigged
i'm also not saying it was fair how
would i know
how would i know i mean it would be
ridiculous for me to have an opinion i
couldn't know either way
but i do know
that the january 6 hearings are so
so illegitimate
and they're being presented to us
as
the the primary mechanism of
congress
so congress is saying this is the system
that we choose to use
to address this topic
and we're watching right in front of us
a non-credible
 propaganda
system
largely with one side presented in the
other knot
now of course the left has been so so
brainwashed that they say well there
could be two sides if the republicans
would just you know nominate some
reasonable people to be on the committee
no it doesn't work that way
the democrats don't get to decide
who is on the team for the republicans
but they decided they would decide that
because that's the system and so the
republicans said all right we're not
going to be basically not going to play
except for the two rhinos that don't
count
and so
we have a system that is completely
corrupt
completely propaganda completely bad for
the country completely
and they're doing it right in front of
us
right in front of you
they're not even hiding it
they're not hiding any of it this is
clearly
a political process complete
now
when i say it's complete
somebody later will say scott is
defending the violent people who tried
to overthrow the country
no i'm not
no i'm not and you for saying that
whoever you are because you'll say it
later
i'm not
every single republican i've ever talked
to said prosecute the law breakers
everyone
to a person privately publicly
whispered
shouted in every form
every republican everyone every
republican
disavows the violence that happened that
day everyone
everyone that i've talked to have you
met any that had a different opinion
right
so to me the the january 6 hearings have
proven
that the protesters have good instincts
that they can identify
a corrupt process
and call it out because the corrupt
processes are no longer hidden from our
our senses
they do it right in front of us now
and so the january 6 people thought
well here's another example
if we live in a world where they do it
right in front of you you know the
russia collusion thing they did right in
front of us
that wasn't some like hidden thing
behind the screen
that was right in front of you
and you knew it was from the
start right
so if you live in a world where you get
used to
the system
lying to you being corrupt
and not trying to hide it
that's that's critical
not trying to hide it this is not the
january 6 hearings are not hidden it's
public by design and it's propaganda by
design
anybody can see it
so i think that the january 6 hearings
have just proven that the protesters
instincts were good
different from
saying that they were right about the
election being rigged there's no
evidence that i've seen of that
but their instinct
when they saw something that looked to
them to be
wrong
i think their instincts were accurate
not correct
perhaps they might have been wrong but
their instincts were at least tuned
to recognize
they saw
maybe they were wrong
maybe
and they acted on
like patriots trying to protect the
system
the the protesters were more like white
blood cells trying to attack uh a cancer
so yeah we we've all
fell into the narrative that it was you
know violent bad people trying to
overthrow the government or at least
much of the country fell into that
but
i think it would be more accurate to say
it was more like white blood cells
recognized some cancer and they just
surrounded it
and
there was some other stuff that got
heard in the process
which we all regret
that's the whole point of the hearings
to make sure it doesn't get bigger next
time
really
you think that's the whole point
i don't think so i think the whole point
of the hearings
was to prevent trump from getting
elected
um
i was having a little uh twitter
exchange with barry rittenholtz on
twitter now what's interesting about
this
is that um
first of all i like barry
he's interviewed me so i've you know
i've got to talk to him in public
and when you talk to people in public
often they're completely reasonable and
he was very nice very generous
um
nice guy so i have only good things to
say about him personally
um
but we disagree on this january 6th
thing
and here's an exchange
pick down of several
that sums it up so i tweeted this i said
you can hate the january 6 protest
violence
and also hate the january sex hearings
they are approximately equally up
so that was my tweet
barry he says that's where we clearly
disagree now he was referring to a
larger conversation we had if you want
to see it in context
it'd be on my twitter feed today he says
i despise those who tried to prevent the
peaceful transition of power through
violence and i applaud those who are
investigating them
what
what persuasion principle
is barry using either intentionally or
unintentionally it's hard to know i'll
read it again tell me what persuasion
principle is in this i despise those who
tried to prevent the peaceful transition
of power through violence and i applaud
those who are investigating them
right thinking past the sale
neither of these things are in question
there's no republican who's questioning
whether violent uh criminals should be
investigated and prosecuted nobody
there's no conversation about that
how about the conversation of whether
there should be a peaceful transition of
power
if everything works well
there's no argument about that
that's not even what we're talking about
how about
um should you investigate
any you know crimes or bad behavior
yes
nobody's talking about that so barry
wants you to think that the usb is
trying to make you think pass the sale
again i don't know if it's intentional
or we're not
but
i don't see anybody trying to prevent a
peaceful transition of power
and i don't see anything like a valid
investigation i see a one-sided hearing
that's meant to be a political
event
and i see
some protesters who tried to make sure
that the transfer of power was done
correctly
that's what i say so he's made you think
past the most important questions of why
they were there and what's going on and
how is this committee formed and you're
trying to make you think that you're
talking about the principle of should
you be against crime
is there anybody here who thinks
that maybe we should be
like letting criminals go
i mean and i look at this and i think
so and here's the part that's throwing
me because i've met
barry
uh riddles
i ca i can tell you for sure that he's
smart
and he wouldn't say something in public
like if he didn't
you know think it was a valid thing to
say
so when you see things like this
you wonder is this cognitive dissonance
because generally speaking if somebody's
smart but what they're saying sounds a
little absurd
that's usually what it is
you can't know for sure
uh let's not play that game there was
definitely violence
oh man
oh man
oh man
i'm trying not to snap
but but i feel like this is gonna be a
losing battle
okay i'm gonna stop
we all know there was violence
we all
 know there was violence
nobody's in favor of it
is that unclear
is there somebody here who thinks that
we're excusing the violence
anybody does anybody want to come up and
just
admit you're so thick that you
think somebody's excusing the violence
and that we think the government should
be overthrown or something
why are you what is wrong with you
what the is wrong with you really
seriously
how's the side game going have you
decided how high i am today
what what's the over under on that
um quite high
a little high
all right well you can't tell can you
can't tell huh
what's that mean
what's it mean if he can't tell
all right
um
on the positive side
well now let's not get to the positive
side yet so hillary clinton
says that he was talking she's talking
about justice
tom thomas
and she says i went to law school with
justice thomas he's been a person of
grievance for as long as i have known
him resentment grievance anger
blah blah and i thought to myself
and you know somebody said this on
twitter that i i retweeted
that
if you don't understand what
narcissistic projection is
you don't understand the last several
years
and
narcissistic projection is something
that you almost can't understand
until it happens to you
has anybody had it happen to them
where there was a narcissist who would
accuse them of a weird crime
that you had never done
but they had
so i'm seeing lassie essence
now it does seem to me and i'd love to
see if there's any kind of actual uh
because i'll bet there is about you
could actually find some science to show
that the at least the most progressive
crazy parts
of the left are
narcissists what do you think
because hillary clearly is
if you
well i'm no expert so i can't um
i can't
i can't give her a diagnosis but i would
say that the the things you would look
for in a narcissist would be that you're
doing things and then blaming other
people for those things and she does
that
so yeah we can at least observe directly
that
some of the qualities of a narcissist
she's presenting
and if you don't understand that i don't
think you understand anything about the
last several years
now let me give a compliment today
there's a
pro-publica is a um
would you call it an online magazine or
a publication
uh
they took a whole bunch of videos
somehow they got access there was a
programmer who had stored
a bunch of videos from the parlor
social media system
before they were deleted
and he put them together in the best
interface
i've ever seen for the news
and i'm going to recommend that you look
at it just to see how good
news could be
just just how well you could do it if
you combined
good user interface design with the news
now i have a hypothesis
that the people who know how to do good
interface design
have nothing in common with and never
talk to the people who do journalism and
news
they're just such different businesses
that there's a reason the news is so
poorly done
whereas you know apple's interfaces are
well done because one uses user
interface experts and one does not
um but here's what they did they took
all the videos from the
january 6 protests
they put them in chronological order
and then there's a timeline where you
can move the timeline and you can see
what video
and where it was you see which which
part of the capital they were and you
could see what the what the energy was
and who was saying what
now part of that shows that alex jones
and ellie alexander
were quite aggressively trying to get
people to not go into the dangerous
place and not do anything violent
it's on video
there's alex jones and there's ali
alexander
encouraging strongly strongly
encouraging people about to do anything
bad
interesting
so uh congratulations to pro publica
for
doing the best job i've seen so far of
combining
uh a user interface with the news
now here's my big idea
do you want to totally control the world
let me tell you how
build a better user interface
that can work as a dashboard for the
news
and then you'll run the world
so here's what the dashboard would look
like so it's one page and let's say the
top
important economic and political topics
are are in like blocks
so every day you come on it's the same
blocks so that the front page is always
the same
the only difference is
that if there's an update on that area
of the the world let's say the economy
you see a little indicator there that
there are six new stories
so you click on and there'd be
at the top level you'd see some kind of
a graph
so it might show inflation is going up
or it might show
uh you know coronavirus going down or up
or whatever
so basically the the front view of
everything would be the long-term trend
and then if
there's an indication you click on it
and you say oh there's an update here
but here's the important part show both
sides
so your article should show to the best
pro
and the best con
not to every article in the world but
just to the best one pro and the best
one con
and then also have some kind of a
mechanism where
people commenting on those two articles
you could promote the best comments
because the commenters themselves
would promote the argument that they
think is agrees with them but is best
expressed
so you could have a system that bubbles
up the best comments
for both sides
before and against
now twitter
kind of almost does that
because you can you can like
a comment but you'd still have to go
look for it right
am i right it to find out who got the
most you know likes on comment you sort
of have to go look for it but that
should go to the top
the the one that people say and maybe
it's a different button instead of like
maybe the button is
best argument
how about that instead of like it's just
the best argument button
so if it agrees with you you say yeah
that's the best argument boom and then
yours goes up and it matches the other
best argument the other side
now if you built that interface
you would basically
run the world
because you could subtly
you know subtly bias it any way you want
it
as long as people liked it
they would keep using it
all right uh
but you'd have to do a real good job on
the interface that's the key
did you notice that uh on any of the
videos of the january 6 protesters did
you notice what they were chanting
did you hear the chance they were
chanting uh usa usa usa
do you know what they warrant chanting
trump trump trump
again this is something that the january
6 hearings
have you know kicked up to my attention
through the through the related
conversations about it
but
if you're going to a protest
and you're
you're saying usa
isn't that sort of a tip-off that you're
there for the united states
you're not there to overthrow the
country
do people who overthrow countries
chant the name of the country when
they're doing it
that feels like a
like a non-intuitive thing to do
if you hate your country so much you're
literally risking your life to overthrow
it i don't think you're chanting its
name
i think that's the point where you're
thinking i think we've got to change the
damn name after we overthrow it because
i hate this place but they were chanting
the name of the country now i've said
for the longest time
that the the vast majority of the
protesters were there to save the
republic not to destroy it
and they thought it was at risk they
thought the election was rigged may have
been wrong i don't know how would i know
but they thought so and i think it was
an honest belief based on their
instincts which actually are have been
shown to be pretty good
because the protesters didn't believe
that a system
run by the government was credible
and then the the government proved they
were right
by by putting together another system
the january six hearings which are
completely non-credible because they're
one-sided
so
you can't tell people that they're wrong
about their instincts and then prove
their instincts are right right in front
of them
or can you
apparently you can
you can do bad things right in front of
people now
like hunter's laptop
so
so the news that you can see in some
places
but is not being carried by the major
news is that joe biden said he didn't
know about hunter biden's dealings with
china
and now there's an audio recording
showing that he definitely knew about
the dealings with china
biggest story in the country
not being reported
and if you're a republican
you're watching this right in front of
you
nothing's being hidden you're looking at
the news it's sort of right-leaning
you're saying wait a minute i'm
listening
to hunter biden talk
like i'm hearing it with my own eyes
there's no doubt about what's happening
here it's very clear that
hunter and his father talked about his
chinese business
you can tell by the recording
and yeah you're watching as you know 90
of the news is pretending it didn't
happen
so
do you think the january 6
protesters instincts
that the system would do something
obviously corrupt right in front of them
and just act like they had
nope
nope
no the protesters had the correct
instinct
doesn't mean they're right
but their instinct that wherever weasels
are in charge
you get a weasel outcome
has never been wrong in the history of
the whole world
let me say that again
in every case where weasels are in
charge of building a system whatever the
system is could be the hearings could be
could be anything
wherever weasels are in charge
the system will be corrupted
so
do you think that the republican
protesters
accurately understood
that weasels were in charge of the
elections in various states yes they did
yes they did they did understand that
and so their instinct that wherever
there are weasels there's trouble
was right on
the only thing we don't know is how much
right
i've not seen any evidence that there
was enough trouble
you know to change the election result
not personally doesn't mean it isn't
there
by the way just an update on
2000 mules can you give me a fact check
on this somebody tweeted today
that uh
oh
why am i blanking so ben shapiro was one
uh
what is the name of the
famous
or right-wing blonde pundit
who writes best-selling books
why ann coulter i'm sorry
just weird blankie underneath so is it
true that both ann coulter and ben
shapiro have uh called on 2000
mules
can somebody
can somebody give me
a fact check on it
yes
shapiro did okay i did i saw ann coulter
do it so then that's a guess all right
so what do you make of that
for those of you who are believers in
this is actually really interesting i'm
going to divert here for a minute
what do you do if you're a republican
you're a conservative
and you saw that two of the smartest
people on your team
who are pretty much always on your team
two of the smartest people on your team
disagree with you about the credibility
of that
the allegations in two thousand meals
what do you make of that
uh
their argument seems light on facts well
their argument is that the other side
doesn't have facts
so
they don't need facts they just need to
say the other facts are not bad they
don't need facts
yes their opinions on trump yeah we we
know that everybody has different
opinions on trump i think we're just
that's baked in
you don't trust them
but let's let's dig into that a little
bit all right
so
in theory this should trigger cognitive
dissonance in a lot of people
in theory because it's the right setup
because you would have to understand why
you why you believe that the
the film is uh convincing
you'd have to hold that in your head at
the same time
two of the smartest people
who have looked at it and really thought
about it are saying now there's nothing
there
how do you explain that now i saw
somebody say that you can't trust them
meaning that maybe they believe it's
real but for reasons that i don't
understand they would lie about it in
public
do either of them have a history of
lying in public
that i don't know about
you know
let me give
ben shapiro a compliment
if i may
has anybody ever ever
has he ever been even accused of lying
that's actually that's a serious
question because i don't know
that would be kind of rare wouldn't it
obviously accused of having opinions
people don't like
but i don't believe anybody's ever
accused ben shapiro of lying
i mean it seems like that would be about
as deeply against his
world view of morality and ethics as
anything could possibly be
now ann coulter i don't know if i
followed her enough to know you know she
may be
hyperbolic and she may
she may be wrong
but has anybody ever accused her of
lying
like intentionally lying now i'm not
counting hyperbole that's
everybody does that so somebody says yes
twisting
i don't know i feel like you could have
all kinds of opinions about both of
those characters
but
i think you have to treat them as
credible
don't you
i do i treat them both as credible even
when i don't agree with their opinions
on something specific but they're very
very credible in my opinion and very
smart
now i'm going to add my opinion to that
you know the the reason you're watching
is you must think there's some value in
my opinion i don't yet
see the 2000 mule thing as persuasive
doesn't mean it's not there like maybe
you'd have to dig deeper to get
something but it didn't convince me it's
a persuasive content if you watch it by
itself
but
it's just short of
the fire
it's like there's smoke but maybe it's
steam
you know you can't tell
it's definitely smoke or maybe a steam
but i'm looking for the fire and i
haven't found it
now i do i did see a clip that there's
some
you know uh truth the vote
claims they've got some big bombshell
coming unless that was an old video
is can some give me a fact check on that
is it current news
or old news
that
truth of oh has some kind of bombshell
election thing about arizona coming
so far none of the bombshells have been
bombshells right everything's been
undone
i don't know if that's going to change
uh why don't they just debate i don't
know good question
um
scott still thinks there's no early
treatment
i don't know you're talking about
oh about covet
that's such old news
um
john eastman the attorney who was
central to the january six stuff worked
with trump
and uh
there's video of uh so he was
stopped by law enforcement and they took
his phone
before they showed him the warrant
and apparently that's illegal
and because he's a lawyer he's he's
gonna press that point and and
but then i saw the video if you heard
that somebody took your phone
before showing you the legal warrant
that said they could do it
you'd think that was pretty bad wouldn't
you
right so when i heard that i thought oh
shoot
that's like really bad especially for
you're you're gonna you're gonna take a
lawyer's property and not show a warrant
like that's gotta be trouble and then i
saw the video
okay this is such news
now i'm not going to argue what is legal
versus not legal because the you know
eastman might be completely right about
the technicalities but here's what i saw
uh john eastman hey you're taking my
phone where's the warrant show me the
warrant where's the warrant you're
taking my phone don't take my property
where's the warrant i don't see any
warrant where's the warrant
now here's the warrant
okay i'm reading the warrant but
everybody saw that they took my phone
before he handed me the warrant
and yes
that's exactly what happened
they took his property
they could not look at it because they
didn't have the passwords so so no
information was gone but they physically
took possession of his phone
before they handed him the piece of
paper
uh is that a crime
do you think the court is going to say
that
literally literally that these two
things are different
all right i took your phone and then i
handed you the paper
so that's illegal
but if i had handed you the paper
and then taken your phone
that would be legal
seriously is the court going to say that
one of those was illegal and the other
one wasn't if they both happened within
60 seconds
they happened within a minute
within a minute
[Laughter]
and and they didn't have access to
anything in his phone they just had it
in their hand
that's it
somebody says no affidavit oh there
wasn't something attached to it that
makes it legal or something who knows
yeah he may have some technical argument
and i actually hope he wins it i hope
eastman
uh
wins his uh legal battle there
but
what do you think about
the fact that law enforcement can get
access to your entire phone
i think if that goes on much longer we
have to overthrow the government
if law enforcement can do a general
warrant
and get all the information on your
phone not not just specific information
that i think would be worth overthrowing
the government of the united states
now apparently that's happening
i don't know if it's widespread i mean
it would have to be widespread to get me
that angry
but
what happens when political enemies
just to have their phone uh grabbed for
general searching
just because somebody came up with a
warrant how hard is it to get a warrant
you can get a warrant pretty easily can
you
so wouldn't this just be a way to just
destroy people
just get their phone and find out what's
on there and destroy
to me
to me this is a big enough issue
that if the government allowed it on an
ongoing basis like if it became not an
exception but like a way of doing
business
i think you should actually we should
overthrow the government
if the government can't stop it from
happening i think that would be
that would be hypothetically reason to
march on the capitol and actually
overthrow the government
who disagrees
anybody disagree
i think i said one person disagreed
somebody says i'm afraid this will get
you cancelled no it's not you don't get
cancelled for hypotheticals
you can't get cancelled for a
hypothetical if i called for a violent
insurrection
that would be um something they could
cancel before but i'm not
i'm saying that there is a condition
upon which uh
a revolution would make sense
and that they are teasing us that this
condition is going to become our norm
and maybe it is
but that that's when you would die on
that hill
tell me about your other illegal
activities if i ever bought any
fertilizer
oh i got truckloads no i'm not kidding
i'm just kidding
all right
well here's another comment about the
january 6 trial i tweeted that
so far you've only seen the muggles
version
and that's the part that will be our
history
let me just say this
i don't
i've been observing um the big stories
in politics
both uh the way you have publicly
but also i i've had sort of special
access to a lot of stories you know
behind the curtain
and there's one thing that you could say
about every story
behind the curtain
it's different
it's different
like really different
the stories that you hear about
everything are leaving out with such
important stuff
and if you're behind the hill behind the
the curtain
you often can hear that stuff and you
know okay that story is completely
different than the way the public
understands it
now i first understood this when i saw
stories about myself
i'd read stories about me and i would
know they were fake
but you think the other ones are true
so yes the january 6th thing i can
guarantee you that whatever uh whatever
comes out of it whatever narrative
becomes the official one whatever
becomes our history
it won't be true
i guarantee it
just like every other story the
political stories are never true because
they always leave out
well the whole point of this was a
billionaire was mad at another
billionaire because the guy stole his
girlfriend
like a lot of the stories have that kind
of i made that one up that's not real
but a lot of them are a billionaire was
mad at another billionaire
and you never get that part reported but
then that billionaire funded somebody
who funded something that caused the
thing that you saw
yeah the real the real root cause
of most things will never be known but
if you see them you're like oh god this
january 6th thing has written all over
it
in in really bright letters
you'll never know the real story you'll
never know
there's no investigation that'll tell
you that because the investigation will
turn into a narrative
nobody really has the incentive to tell
you the truth about any of this stuff so
you won't see it
so you're getting the muggles version
that's a harry potter reference
um
so here's some
interesting news so there's a mark
meadow's aide who's going to testify i
guess or maybe she did and
cnn reported that during one of her
interviews so that she's already done
interviews
she said that
trump had suggested to meadows that he
approved of the hang mike pence chant
suggest it
suggested
what do you think were the actual words
that happened and the actual true events
that caused this observer who was now
part of it to say that trump had
suggested
that hang mike pence was a you know an
okay chant from his point of view
that word suggested is a is a tip off
suggested means he didn't say it
do you know what she would have said
if she heard trump say
i like that there's they're saying hang
mike pence she would have said
he said he liked it
but instead she said
trump had suggested to meadows
that he approved suggested that he
approved
how about just saying i like this
it sounded like an interpretation
doesn't it yeah it's a little weasely
let's see if there's any more weaseling
here oh yeah
she also testified
that trump had complained about his
vice president being hustled to safety
when when the capital got breached
complained
do you really think he complained
that mike pence was protected
do you think that's real do you really
think he did that
now i'm sure he was thinking something
more complicated than
mike pence being protected or not like
i'm sure
yeah it could have been sarcasm it could
have been hyperbole it could have been
anything
so
he complained but what were his words
if you don't know what his words were
you're looking at somebody's
interpretation
if somebody says you complained does
that mean you complained
no it means they said you complained
if
if
somebody suggested somebody says you
suggested something does that mean you
said it
maybe not
so this is just a written all
over
there's a
new study about marijuana risks that
marijuana users recreational marijuana
users have more emergency room visits
what do you think of that true or not
marijuana users have more emergency room
visits for recreational activities
well
are there any other activities
which would cause more emergency room
visits
let's think of anything else that would
cause more emergency room visits
sports
sports
dirt bikes
yeah
taking your medicines but maybe doing it
wrong
pretty much every activity
drinking yeah pretty much every activity
that we do for fun
uh increases the risk that you'll end up
in the emergency room
doesn't it
so wouldn't you expect
that marijuana users
like any other activity would have more
visits to the emergency room do you know
what what is a great thing to do when
you're high
go do an activity
so there are people who wouldn't do the
activity if they weren't high in the
first place
you know what i mean
you'd have to be a smoker to actually
understand that there's some things you
just wouldn't do you're just like ah
i'm happy sitting here i'll take a walk
but then you smoke some marijuana and
you're like i think i can play tennis
even though i've never had a lesson
and you go out there and you sprain an
ankle because you're not a tennis player
so but you had fun right so
i've got a feeling that this is
well let let me go through this for the
other
tells that you shouldn't believe it
here's another tell who paid for the
study
who who funded the study
if it's a marijuana is bad for you
outcome of a study
who do you think funded it
probably the alcohol industry
probably
probably
i don't know but if it doesn't state who
funded it why would you believe it
you shouldn't believe anything if you
don't know who paid for it period
um
let's say apparently there's some kind
of like intestinal problems some people
get from it that all my life i've never
heard of
let's say i've smoked marijuana for
50 years
i've never heard of anybody getting a
going to the emergency room with a
marijuana stomach ache
have you
but apparently this is a thing
i don't know never heard of it
so but that's a that's a problem
and then heavy users of marijuana by
teens and young adults with mood
disorders such as depression and bipolar
have been linked to an increased risk of
self-harm
but
there again you've got the cause and
effect problem backwards
seems to me that sad people would be
more likely to do a drug than happy
people do you know who doesn't need a
drug
somebody is already happy do you know
who needs a drug somebody who feels
depressed
so i feel like they've got cause and
effect backwards or at least it's
unclear
they've got no information about who
funded the study and then the biggest
thing that's missing
do you know what the biggest thing
that's missing is
so the idea is that marijuana users end
up in the emergency room more often
what's missing
like really really missing from the
analysis
mortality rates
kind of obviously missing is it
because if people who smoke marijuana
were more likely to die
then you probably
you know at least and once you've
corrected for other comorbidities and
stuff
well that would tell you something
wouldn't it
but what if the what if the mortality
rate of marijuana users even heavy users
is exactly the same
as the mortality rate for everybody else
what if that's true
wouldn't you want to know that because i
would say that even though there might
be emergency room visits
on the whole people are getting
something out of it
there's a risk but it's like everything
else
but suppose the mortality rate of
marijuana smokers was much higher
well that would be important to put in
this story wouldn't it
because that would support everything
the story says
why is it missing from the story
there was a study on mortality rates so
they could have referenced it don't you
think a story about the risks of
marijuana
should reference
the one study that was ever done about
mortality rate of chronic smokers of
marijuana
that's the most important thing it's not
there do you know why it's not there
because the mortality rate of chronic
marijuana smokers and everybody else is
the same
the one study that looked at it how
about the lung capacity
of chronic marijuana smokers versus
people who never smoked anything
well there was one study on that it says
that the chronic marijuana smokers had
better lung capacity
why don't they mention that
why don't they mention that marijuana
effectively treats depression
so if you have fewer people who are
depressed
that's almost like saving their lives
i mean it's hardly any difference except
technically
if somebody is depressed and can't
figure a way out of it
and you fix it you've saved their life
i mean
not technically but basically you saved
their life so how many people had their
life saved by marijuana
and that's not really like other
recreation right
how many people had their life saved by
riding bicycles
maybe somebody i don't know
but it's not really a thing but probably
a lot of people had their lives actually
saved by marijuana
people are saying mine i'm going to add
myself the list
i would have committed suicide in my
youth without marijuana it was actually
my plan
because i was
desperately in pain
in massive pain every single day of my
early life
so from my earliest memory to about the
age of 18 i had a massive
intestinal stomach problems every day
i was in shrieking pain every day of my
life
and i was planning to just kill myself
because i didn't know who i am
but i discovered marijuana in college
first first day of college actually
and it solved it i completely
just solved it
completely the biggest problem i'd ever
had in my life just went away
never came back
did you ever discover the cause of the
pain probably
meat and grease and bad diet
something like that i mean there are
some compounding things that i won't get
into
but
and then later when i changed my diet
then i didn't need marijuana so when i
went to a vegetarian and then
pescetarian diet i don't get any i don't
get any stomachaches
does it come back if you don't smoke no
it doesn't that's yeah that's what i was
just saying that i changed my diet so
what my actual problem was was my diet
but i didn't know it at the time
so i didn't have a solution because i
was eating the same food everybody else
was eating i just had no reason to think
that it was bad for me and not bad for
other people
uh bad bacteria in your gut i don't know
maybe
so
many many problems with that
study um there's a article in fatherly
that's a publication
and it said
that in general being an american male
is hazardous to health the men in the
usa die an average of five years before
women do and i guess men in other
countries do better
life expectancy
so here's an article that uh men are
dying from a whole bunch of stuff a lot
of it is lifestyle they they overeat
they drink they do dangerous things uh
here's my overall comment about the life
expectancy of men
nobody cares
nobody cares about that
do they
i'm a man even i don't care about it do
you know why
because almost everything on this list
that kills men
we choose
we choose
right if if drinking is dangerous and i
choose to drink
well
what's the problem
if riding a bicycle is dangerous
as it was yesterday when i rode over
some glass and popped my tires on a
busy highway i had a bad day i had a
real bad night last night
i won't get into it
i won't get into it but it was supposed
to be a terrific night on my e-bike it
turned into a
when i ran over some glass anyway that's
about me you don't care about that the
point is that if men are making riskier
choices
fully aware of the risk
if they don't care
why do you care
why do i care so it's sort of an
interesting factoid that we're supposed
to get excited about but if men are
dying faster because they do things
knowingly you know completely knowingly
about what the risks are well
i know that's not going to be my top
problem
all right
and the article in fatherly
uh suggested that
one of the reasons that men do riskier
things
is because of masculine stereotypes
men
let's speak to this because they're
they're women watching
and we can educate them now is the
reason that do men do
riskier things because of our masculine
stereotype
no
no
i can i can see why that that would have
an effect right i i could see that a
masculine
stereotype might encourage you to act a
certain way
there's there's some of that i'm not
going to discount that entirely
but far and away far and away is our our
chemical composition
it's our chemical composition that makes
us do risky stuff
we're literally designed for it
we're designed for risky behavior
we don't even hate it you know i often
talk about the violent world of men
but the reason it's not like a you know
a huge topic that men walk around in a
continuous state of implied violence
it's because we like it
we're born to it we're designed to be in
dangerous situations
we're kind of drawn to it not every
person right like everybody's different
so men are different i'll give you all
that you don't have to argue the
specifics but on average
we're designed to go kill
that's what we were built for
so if you see it happening don't be too
surprised
you know if you designed a killer
you get a killer
yeah we evolved to do exactly the the
risky stuff and it makes sense
because there are too many men for
reproduction
but if men are out there doing risky
things some of it will pay off
you know you can start a startup
you know
use all of your money to
try to find a new medicine but maybe
sometimes you succeed
so that risky behavior is is purely
positive not for the people taking the
risk always but for the rest of us
i have three sons this is my observation
about danger i'm not raising killers
yes you are
[Laughter]
so there's a mom here on locals
who's saying that she has three sons and
she's not raising killers i think you
are
i think you are
now on average all right if there are
three of them i'm not going to say all
three are going to be killers but if you
think that not one of three sons
would kill somebody if the situation
called for it i think you're probably
wrong
pretty much most men would kill somebody
under the right conditions i mean you'd
have to have a reason
but
when i when i play through my mind
killing somebody who has it coming
i never imagine it has lasting negative
impact on me
do you
you ever think that way i do think if i
you know accidentally killed somebody
like that would haunt me forever
for sure
but if somebody was like you know a home
invader
you know they were in the process of a
violent crime and you took him out
i can't imagine that i would ever have
like even lose a little sleep about that
i don't even think i think about it much
i
i think men can kill
when the reason is good enough
somewhat effortlessly
[Laughter]
as they say in texas some people deserve
a
killing all right so uh let me give you
the answer now um
how high am i
go
in the comments
how high am i
i'm seeing very slightly not four out of
ten you're all over the place seven out
of ten three and ten
uh
not
so you're all over the place some people
to say nine into ten
are you ready for the answer
not the answer is zero
so
are is that interesting to you is it
interesting that you couldn't tell
because
i've been pretty high when i've done
these live streams and
you know unless i told you you didn't
know the difference
or just guess right
i noticed you're talking faster you were
correct
oh somebody got to tell the tell is that
i talk faster
yeah and now that's also a sativa versus
indica difference the indica makes me
talk slower and i was quite aware of it
when i accidentally did the indica
the sativa can make me
a little closer to my current speed
you i don't think you'd notice as much
am i sick no oh let me ask you this
i'm not sure i don't have long covet i
told you i didn't
because i haven't had the brain fog
but
the afternoons i've experienced a type
of fatigue that i've never experienced
before
like a completely unnatural kind
and
it's getting me pretty much every
afternoon
so my mornings are still okay although
it's really hard to
get my body working in the morning it
sort of aches like it never used to
uh
but it seems to me that in the afternoon
i have a kind of fatigue
that i didn't have a year ago now so
people are saying age and that's the
obvious you know hypothesis
but does it change in one year
and that's a pretty big change i mean
it's really profound and i know what
fatigue feels like
right i know what fatigue feels like it
doesn't feel like this
so whatever whatever this is
now somebody's saying it's you know
marijuana but remember i'm a lifetime
chronic marijuana sleeper sleeper
i'm a lifetime chronic marijuana user
so i know exactly what my energy should
be like at any time of the day in every
situation and this is completely and a
pattern completely this is so far out of
pattern
that i don't know if i should be
hospitalized for it or go to the doctor
i'm going to wait it out
no it's not depression because i don't
have a mental
problem that's associated with it
can you nap yes
yes but
i'm in order to get past
this uh fatigue i would have to nap two
to three hours an afternoon
roughly
but if i do i feel pretty good
and i've done that a few times
but it's hard
my current problem is that i itch when i
lay down
i don't know how much of that is
psychological maybe all of it as soon as
i lay down to sleep i start
my body itches
and the itches on the parts i'm laying
on
that i can't reach so i have to move
so if i lay on my left side the left
side where i'm laying on i get an
incredible itch on the part i can't
reach
and then i get an itch right in the
middle of my back where i can't reach
bed bugs now stop bed bugs
uh
so i sleeping in an easy chair
well i do have a massage chair that i
can sleep and find
i may go get blood work because this is
crazy would it would i try trt yeah
maybe
you know i looked into it years ago
years ago i was
you know having some physical
it was turns out to be exhaustion
uh but i thought maybe i was low on
testosterone this is probably in my 40s
and so i went and had it checked and it
was just normal
so it was just fatigue
uh
you were of a certain age get checked
yeah i mean i would i would assume my
testosterone is lower
but it was
the
the fatigue happened directly after the
covet and was never there like that
before or so
i don't know
no i don't have any post-depression
post-divorce depression because remember
remember by the time you hear about
something in my personal life
it's already a year old because you
don't hear it when it's fresh right so
the divorce is in my rear view mirror
that's not affecting me right now
am i turning into a trans
good question
um
dehydration
you know i thought maybe dehydration but
i
i so i've been hydrating a lot
it's inflation that's a problem all
right nobody wants to talk about my
problems anymore but
um
dr drew yeah he he had long covered for
sure
but
i think i have it
that would that would be my best
hypothesis
somebody says see a doctor but there's
nothing you can do about long covert is
there
i don't think there is anyway
i'll talk to you tomorrow on youtube bye
for now
