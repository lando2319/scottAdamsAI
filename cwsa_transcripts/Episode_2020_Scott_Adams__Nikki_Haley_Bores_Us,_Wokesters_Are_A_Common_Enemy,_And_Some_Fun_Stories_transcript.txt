you YouTube people
good morning and welcome to the
highlight of civilization itself it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a finer moment it's why
everybody's talking about it probably
everywhere you go to your people blah
blah blah coffee with Scott Adams yeah
it's like that everywhere and if you
would like to enjoy this experience in a
way that nobody ever
ever has enjoyed it
well all you need is a copper mugger a
glass of tanker chalices dying a canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
oh sip sip Surrey
yeah no sip sip sorry now that doesn't
work
all right well
the news is
funny and unimportant today mostly funny
and unimportant and that's the best kind
the best kind of news is the stuff you
can be entertained by and not worry
about too much
so number one in the news that isn't
very important at all but it's funny
uh White House spokesperson Jean-Pierre
uh she said quote
the president is the best Communicator
that we have in the White House
I will pause while you enjoy the Deep
hearty laugh that you're having at home
ha ha
and as you might imagine the Wags the
critics
the people who just can't handle a happy
thought
they waited and they said things like
well that explains a lot
oh
you're reminding me of the cruelest
thing
that a teacher ever said to a child
it happened in a science class my
science class I was in it when I was I
don't know 14 or 15 or something and
I've been inside this class and our
science teacher was a very well-known
badass in the town so he was a teacher
but he was a badass
and one day he was telling us that you
know you can't look at the sun because
it would you know burn your redness or
something
and there was a kid in the first row
who raised his hand and you'd have to
know that the kid in the first row
uh he had been promoted since
kindergarten without passing any classes
now that was how they did it in the old
days I think he passed zero classes but
he'd already gotten into high school so
they didn't really have like a special
class for the people who couldn't pass
any class he had you know serious
learning disability problems
and so this kid who was famous as being
the one kid who probably had never
literally never passed a class he's
sitting there and the professor says you
know you can't look at the sun you know
don't look at the Sun
and the kidney front row raises the hand
he goes I look at the sun all the time
and the professor looks at him they're
not Professor but the the science
teacher
the science teacher looks at him and in
front of the entire class he goes
well that explains a lot
that actually happened
if you could imagine
that the rest of us were crying because
it was so cruel and funny at the same
time it was really cruel
but it was very funny
true story so uh yes the the Biden is
the best Communicator in the White House
and uh maybe that does explain a lot
maybe he does
well Wall Street Journal is reporting
that speed dating is making a comeback
if you don't know what that is it's
where a bunch of single people get
together and they uh they quickly spend
like a minute with each other I don't
know how fast the speed is but it's
really fast so something like a minute
or two you spend with each person you
sit down and say how you doing for about
a minute it's about five minutes
somebody says a few a few minutes I
guess and you use the power of First
Impressions basically because first
impressions are weirdly
reliable in terms of attraction
so here's my prediction
I don't think that online dating
can be a viable long-term solution
and you know that's been well discussed
you know that the the most attractive
guys get 100 of the female interest and
that leaves everybody you know
scrambling for the the scraps I guess
but on top of that
um is there anybody here who uses online
dating
is this even a like a category that
anybody watching this cares about
some of you all right I want I want to
see if I can get a confirmation of this
everybody's lying right
or are the men not lying about their
height and their income and showing old
pictures and are the women not lying
about their appearance and taking the
one photograph that makes them look like
a different person or using the
photograph from 15 years ago and
so
I wouldn't believe anything I saw on an
online dating profile
so it the the whole point of the whole
point of online dating is that you get
more and better information about
Alternatives and you can contact them
right the whole point
is more and better information about
your Alternatives and the ability to
contact them
but once you remove any honesty
there is no information all it is is you
contacting a random person who may or
may not have something in common with
that that online profile so it's
basically just turned into the phone
book
online dating is just the phone book
from the 70s if you had a phone book in
the 70s you can flip through and
randomly dial a number and ask for
somebody for a date
the problem with that is you would have
no idea who you were calling
just like online dating
in 2023 just because the profile says
they're a certain thing it doesn't mean
anything it doesn't have any any
informational value whatsoever you have
no idea who you're getting it's just a
phone book so I'm not surprised that
online or I'm sorry in-person dating
would have a comeback
I feel like that has to happen because
people don't give up on mating
you know young people aren't going to
say well online dating doesn't work so
we just won't do it anymore
I think it has to move back to in person
wouldn't you say what do you think
is it not
um
is it not inevitable that online all the
online stuff is broken so it will become
less important
now we'll see well there's a Harvard
study or study of Harvard people I guess
they've been studying uh 260 Harvard
sophomores they started studying them in
1938 you know trying to find out various
things about their lifestyle and health
and happiness and they basically just
track this little group
what they believe they found
and I believe that they of course did
not find it but what they believe they
found is that the people who had the
best
social lives were the happiest by the
time they reached 80.
the people with the best social
experiences you know the best satisfying
social lives were the happiest at age
80.
what's wrong with that study
it's the whole correlation causation
problem every time
every time
because
I have a feeling that the people who are
able to have satisfying social lives
are probably different kinds of people
does somebody who weighs 400 pounds
have the same access to a happy social
life as someone who doesn't
what do you think
if you weighed 400 pounds would your
social life just be rated
I don't think so if you had you know
some serious health problem
would your dating life be as good as if
you didn't
I mean to me it looks like healthy
people are happier
that's all it is and are you surprised
that healthier people are happier
that that feels like
you haven't learned anything I mean
there's nothing in the information
that's telling you or anything so I feel
like this study first of all it's not
that many people secondly they came from
Harvard so that's a weird sample but to
me it's obvious that good relationships
make people happier
you know no question about that but I
don't think I don't think
you know the 400 pound person can say oh
I know how to be happy now I'll just go
have a good relationships now there's
something about the 400 pounder
that they need to change before the good
relationships are going to be coming in
quantity
so
I think it's basically just a health a
health impact
that they confuse with causation again
well Alex Berenson is catching up to me
finally
finally
so he's got a pretty provocative and
interesting
um
peace in sub stack and he he allowed
everybody to see this one so it's not
behind the paywall and I recommend it
looks like it's well written and
interesting and he starts out by saying
that the regular seasonal flu shots
are closer to a placebo than an actual
useful thing
who who told you that first
who's the first person who told you that
the regular annual flu shot was
well I've been saying it I've been
saying it since the beginning of the
pandemic
because I never I never believed that
people were dying from regular flu at
least in 50 000 a year yeah whoever
believed that 30 000 people a year were
dying from the regular flu
and then therefore you needed to get a
shot so you maybe you wouldn't die
I never believed that
to me that was that just always looked
like obviously so I I have not
taken the regular annual flu shot
for some years I don't know how many
all right so it's good to see that Alex
Berenson has caught up to me on the
regular flu shots being completely
useless
but in his article
um
he had this statement that I thought
perfectly captures my point of view
uh so this is from Alex Berenson well
one of the most famous Skeptics of the
uh covid shots
he says in his peace today quote we now
have two years of real world data on the
MRNA the MRNA shots based on billions of
doses
putting side effects aside so he and I
both accept that the MRNA stuff would
have higher side effects than
traditional things so he and I have
always been on the same side
that the new technology is riskier
all right so we always agreed on that
um
and uh he says putting aside the side
effects that he and I agree on they work
extremely well against covid for about
four months after the second shot
so the the vaccinations only work but
well for about four months
so by complete luck
complete luck I got my second dose right
before the Delta phase
which turned out to be the perfect time
to do it because if Alex Berenson is
right that it was very protective but
only for about four months I hit the
four months perfectly
the four months that I was most
protected was during Delta
now I didn't I didn't plan that but I
had you know the I had the best
accidental timing
now
you would argue that it would be better
not to have any of it in you at this
point and I agree
do we agree on that
as of today if you don't you know if you
didn't get any Delta or Alpha you're way
better off if you just didn't get
vaccinated I think you know with below a
certain age for sure
so I think Alex and I are in exactly the
same page on all of this stuff I would
agree with them completely that uh
getting vaccinated for Omicron would be
a sketchy situation I'm not sure why I
would I would agree with them and always
have that I didn't understand why young
people were getting vaccinated
but apparently for older people and
people have comorbidities and uh people
who got the shot at exactly the right
time it might have been a good insurance
policy
and I did some research to see if the
current thinking is if the vaccinations
uh so-called
not really vaccinations but if the shots
actually had protective effect against
long covet and the current thinking is
yes
not complete production but it would
reduce it
so it looks like I hit it exactly by
luck
all right let's talk about retail sales
jump three percent the news is crowing
uh what would cause retail sales to go
up three percent in January
what uh is there any macro
large economic influence that's been
happening lately called in Flay in Flay
inflation inflation I believe is the
word yeah
can you believe that the news reported
three percent higher retail sales
without mentioning that that's sort of
the rate of inflation
at least for a lot of items it depends
on the item
but okay
all right and this caused me to ask the
following question
what happened to that supply chain
emergency
are are docs still uh to have ships like
waiting for days
did that just stop
how did the news just sort of is sort of
Peter down right
what happened
why why is the news never reported about
all those ships that used to be waiting
to be unloaded but weren't unloaded
how in the world does a story that big
just disappear
do you have I mean seriously I don't
know I don't know how that could happen
like what is happening
there there's something
terrible happening
that this could even be Florida took up
the slack
but there must have been something that
happened
what was it that we slowly adjusted and
moved back to normal as as I see the
comment there or was it that we did
something clever
and that made a difference
or was it never real
I have no idea
isn't that weird
uh did you even notice that in my
opinion that was the biggest story in
the world
because the supply chain problem could
have crashed a lot of stuff and might
still might still
so I asked people you know and so I
tweeted that
and a number of people said no we still
have big problems getting stuff it takes
a long time and a lot of stuff they're
getting seems to be important for you
know the infrastructure and the power
grid and and all that stuff now I've
also noticed that if I'm buying
something sometimes it takes longer to
get here
but I haven't really hasn't been a big
deal in my life
um
yeah I I haven't really noticed any big
deal and I've bought
you know a reasonable number of things
recently they all seem to come maybe
assist I got used to waiting for two
months
because there's a lot of stuff that I
buy now that I wait two months for
and that no longer seems like a long
time to me
specific Firearms or six day months I
can see that but you know it was always
the case
it was always the case there's some
things took months even in the best of
times you know if you buy a high-end car
and let's say a BMW with certain
features you're going to wait months for
that because they have to build it for
you and ship it over here
you've been waiting a month and a half
for some bowling shirts from China
yeah I did have one you know small item
that took a few months but I feel as if
maybe just we all got used to it and it
was never
you're never going to kill us I know
the FDA is considering whether to make
Narcan easier to purchase
and I guess if they if they do this
you won't need a prescription you can
just buy it from Amazon or anywhere else
I guess
um now I love this
I think this is the right thing to do
but
I can't not notice
that the only time we do something that
looks right is if a pharmaceutical
company can make more money
why is that always the case
oh there's only one thing you can do
about
Fentanyl
there's only one thing
just one thing you can do coincidentally
it requires giving a lot more money to a
pharmaceutical company that makes the
Narcan
why is that is that a coincidence
it doesn't feel like a coincidence does
it it feels like unless somebody who is
a big corporate entity can make money
the government won't do a damn thing
it's just like oh this drug company can
make money let's do this now I'm in
favor of it so I don't want to poo-poo
it we should all have Narcan handy and
it does work it does work
well the EU
is effectively Banning gas cars by 20 to
35.
so the emission requirements have been
lowered to the point where no gas car
could ever meet the requirement
so 2035
you think that's too far away too soon
so I think it's all going to be electric
cars or something now of course they
could always revise that in five years
if it looks like it's not going to
happen
but
I don't know
I guess my biggest concern would be that
they wouldn't have enough electricity
I I'm not I don't hate the fact
that we're moving probably to Electric
yeah oh they consulted whatever they
want but has to pass inside each oh okay
there's a I'm seeing a uh clarification
that I was not aware of that if the EU
votes for it it doesn't mean anything
unless the individual countries say yes
that makes sense
is that is that right the individual
countries still have to say yes or what
happens if most of them say yes and some
say no
they still get to do their own thing
or does the EU have some kind of control
over individual Nations
I don't know the answer to that question
all right well anyway that's developing
let's talk about that Ohio explosion
um
how many of you believe that there are
dead fish and dead birds all over the
place
in Palestine Ohio and that that's caused
by the chemical leak
yeah I've I've seen news reports both
ways
uh I've seen news reports that they were
coincidentally dead fish and probably
wasn't caused by that
um I would say I don't believe those
stories
I'm not I'm not saying they're false
but they don't feel believable to me
could be yeah it's a distinct
possibility
but it doesn't feel and here's the part
I'm trying to understand
why would anybody in the government any
any government local or any other why
would any government official
want people to go back to their homes
prematurely
because remember government officials
they're not the ones suffering yeah
they're the ones who give you mandates
I think I feel like the government
would be very conservative because
there's nothing for them to gain to go
back early
but there's plenty to lose if people go
back early and they have diseases from
it so I I feel like the information
coming out of that area is all bad
it's hard to form a clear opinion on
this because I just think everybody's
lying about everything
so I guess that's my bottom line
everybody's lying about everything
well the government says they still
don't know what those three unidentified
objects were that they shot down as of
this morning do you believe that
do you believe that our government does
not know
what those three objects are that they
shot down no those are lies yeah that
definitely lies
do you believe that we got to today
and nobody nobody in the major media
neither left nor right media nobody in
the major media has either mocked me
for saying that here's a picture of the
weather balloon with the octagonal
bottom it's clearly that's what they
shot down at least one of them
because they said it was octagonal
um nobody has either debunked me
or agreed with me
they've just ignored it
what did I predict
I predicted it would be ignored
didn't I and and it's almost impossible
to imagine that that could be ignored
because like I said my Twitter feed hits
every major news entity there's at least
a producer for every news entity that
follows me on Twitter
they've all seen me show the picture
it's an American company they can verify
it by just going to the website like I
it is right on the front page it's on
the front page of their website big
picture of an octagonal payload on a
balloon
now
if you report that there's a UFO with an
octagonal shape that's exactly like what
that balloon has
and you ignore the fact that a
cartoonist found a picture of it on a
website from the company that makes lots
of them and by the way
there should be a fair number of those
octagonal things above our skies right
now
because it's a weather balloon company
and they're doing well they make a lot
of they make a lot of weather balloons
people buy them they're in the air
they're above you they're octagonal now
how in the world could that be ignored
by the entire media
at the very least somebody should be
debunking me
am I right
somebody should say haha cartoonist You
couldn't possibly be right here's why
you know that company went out of
business 10 years ago their website's
still up something you know that's not
the case but something just anything
because when was the last time I I put
anything on Twitter that wasn't debunked
anything
no matter how right or wrong you are
when you put something on Twitter
somebody tries to debunk it
but I put this on here and they just
sort of people go
nobody knows what to do with it
Mike says you're wrong about facts
Mike doesn't know who I am
Mike I'm uh Scott Adams
I'm a cartoonist
uh you should learn something about me
because obviously you don't know
anything about me
yes I did do a husband apology where I
apologized for not knowing what I had
done wrong
and people were nice enough to accept my
apology and I appreciated that
all right
but
um
does Mike did you think that I told
other people what to do with the fact
the so-called vaccination
I'm just curious
is there somebody on YouTube
who believes I recommended somebody else
get Medical Treatments
do you actually believe that
do you actually believe
that I recommended medical
treatments for people
I'm pretty sure I only recommended my
own situation
pretty sure
and why would you why would you fact
check my personal medical decisions
why would you do that
Mike
Mike why would you do that all right
I'll let you go
um Nikki Haley has decided to be boring
um here's her uh they're talking about
what her approach will be or what her
slogan will be
and
she's working with not enough Americans
feel proud of their country and it's
time for a new generation of leadership
and in her announcement speech she will
quote lean into that idea that America
America is not racist and we should be
proud of who we are as Americans
and generations are being taught to hate
America and we need to renew our
American Pride and stop
I'm sorry what was I doing oh I was
reading something about Nikki Haley's
political uh positioning
um I'm bored to death by that
no I like it I like it the the things
that I just said
I agree with and I like but I'm not
really inspired by it
I mean it doesn't come close to make
America great again as provocative as
that is and good and both both bad ways
it's just not I don't know it's just a
nothing
like what what exactly is Nikki Haley
going to be doing about any of that
something a president complained about
but presidents don't have any control
over the school boards and the school
boards decide what the schools teach at
the teachers unions will say teachers
unions decide what gets taught directly
or indirectly
and then the children get brainwashed to
you know feel bad about racism and
themselves and everything else
uh what is Nikki Haley going to do about
any of that
it's a state problem
so she's running for president like
she's running for governor like none of
it it's just like a little bit off
am I wrong
and again I agree with her that America
you know we should learn to think of
ourselves as a non-racist country as
best we can while we're still working on
you know making it that I mean I think I
think it makes sense to be
aspirationally non-racist
but what is she going to do about it
what did anybody ever do about it
it's just not something that the
president works on
so if Nikki Haley can't even come up
with a like a major theme that's
something a president even works on I
mean
yeah what's she gonna do about wars and
inflation and
borders and stuff like that those are
interesting
but the other stuff feels just like talk
all right Rasmussen has a new poll
that
um
is frightening for two different reasons
I'll tell you what the poll says and
then I'll tell you the two reasons is
frightening
one of them may be obvious
the in the head-to-head matchup between
Biden and Trump Biden would win
okay that's the first scary thing
and
to be as objective as possible not
because he's a Democrat that that's not
why I'm saying that's bad
you know some would say that but that's
not my point my point is he's 100 years
old
that's all yeah if you were a republican
I'd say the same thing too old
but apparently he would win against
Trump according to the Rasmussen poll
now here's the second bad news
the second bad news is this might
indicate there's something wrong with
polling
and apparently there are challenges at
the moment
that are uh different than challenges in
the past you know in the old days you
just call it everybody's landline
and you'd guess something that was
semi-useful but now young people don't
answer landlines so you have to get them
through some kind of other mechanism in
which there's payment
so there's a payment involved and
there's some thought that maybe the
young people are you know just checking
boxes to get a payment and maybe they're
not getting the right actual opinions
so there's some hypotheses
within the polling Community there are
some hypotheses that the polling
has some kind of distortion in it that
they're looking for as hard as they can
so I I don't think you need to believe a
poll at the moment
on presidential stuff uh
but uh let's hope that that gets more
credible as we go
all right
but but they're so close I mean it's a
close thing however the poll said that
Trump would beat Kamala Harris if they
ran against each other you know
do personalities matter anymore or is it
really just the process itself
like the Democrats vote for the
Democrats the Republicans vote for the
Republicans and whoever gets out more
votes and games the system the best wins
it no longer feels like it's anything
about the candidates
because when I I play the game in my
head where I change out the Republican
candidates to say okay what if it's
DeSantis one of his pants what if it's
Mike Pompeo
and then I say to myself the same thing
after I'm done I don't think it matters
do you
do you think that Pompeo and DeSantis
would have a different result
I feel like it would be identical
Trump is the only one that's like a wild
card
because people like really will be you
know motivated
people will be motivated to vote for him
run against them Etc but the others are
not really motivating
if you had a non-motivating republican
wouldn't the Democrats win
I don't know that
but I don't think there are enough
Republicans to just win straight up if
you had a generic Republican against a
generic Democrat don't Democrats win
every time
am I wrong about that because they're
just more of them right and more of them
in the places where it matters
Trump was losing in the polls in 2016.
well he was very close by election day I
think by election day the polls were
very close
and in fact the result was very close
Trump took the place of abortion
okay
um
this is what it looks like when Scott
says I'm not supporting Trump
well I am supporting Trump
because he's I'm a single issue voter
this time this time it's just going to
be fentanyl for me I mean I'll talk
about all the issues but my own personal
choice is just whose stuff is unfentanyl
and if somebody else decides to be as
tough As Trump but they're younger
I'd probably jump to that person
it's good I'm telling you I have no
loyalty this time this I'm I'm operating
on zero loyalty one one topic and I
don't recommend that I don't recommend
it for the rest of you I'm just saying
my personal personal choice
all right I like Trump personally
um okay for what that for what that's
worth all right
um have you seen the uh my campaign for
California Senate is going well
um so far the only activity is
Machiavelli's underbelly the Twitter
account that you shall be following
which is running sort of a campaign for
me with
um
deep fakes so there's a shake version of
me that AI creates that gives speeches
that I tweet when I see them and now
there's a Adam Schiff AI that gives a
little talk as a goblin
so as Adam Schiff represented as a
goblin and uh so that's how my campaign
is going
um
now what's happening with you know
Machiavelli's underbelly and these AI uh
ad campaigns they're they're not you
know obviously they're not super serious
in terms of my running for Senate but
it's telling you a lot about what's
coming
you should take a look at them because
imagine you could easily imagine a world
in which the the version of Adam Schiff
as a goblin
becomes viral
and you can't get it out of your head
now I don't know that this one will
become viral you know so far these these
tweets have stayed within a smallish
Community but it would only take one of
them to break out and the AI is so
powerful and so visual
that it could completely Rebrand a
candidate
yeah it could totally Rebrand the
candidate now the reason that the goblin
one won't work is that the goblin that
the AI created was kind of cute
in a goblin way
whereas Adam Schiff is sort of
uh not
like the actual Adam Schiff looks more
like a creature
than what AI created as the comical
creature that was supposed to be him the
real one is super creepy
the artificial one was kind of cute so
it worked opposite of you know how the
power of AI could work which is making
the artificial one creepy you know the
uh
The Uncanny Valley I talk about it too
much it's the effect where if a robot
looks like a proper robot it could be
cute oh that's a cute little robot but
if you made an Android that looked
almost like a human but not quite it
would be a frightening zombie look
because it's like almost a person but
why does it talk like this and its eyes
are too open right you would be
disgusted by it because it's almost
human but there's something wrong ah it
just makes you creep out
imagine AI
taking a real politician speech and only
adding The Uncanny Valley
just like a three percent tweak
so it is the person and when you look at
it you're like I feel like this is the
actual person talking because it would
be they would just be tweaked a little
bit to make them look like The Uncanny
Valley and you would be disgusted by
them at a subconscious level
but it would look just like that person
kind of you know minus two or three
percent
so you can see the power of the tool in
this particular example it made him look
cute so it worked the opposite but you
could yeah once you refine this tool a
little bit and you get that uncanny
valley thing going
it's just going to look just like the
real one
minus two or three percent and I don't
know if you can tell you know we we saw
a preview of this when
um some Democrats had their voices
slowed down
I think it was Nancy Pelosi if you slow
down her voice by just a few percent she
sounded drunk
and also when you played it at full
speed she sounded drunk but she sounded
drunk ER if you slowed it down
do you remember that right so that's the
sort of small change you could make to a
real thing that people would not pick up
they would not pick that up they would
just feel something and they wouldn't
know why
that's how dangerous it is now keep in
mind that no hypnotist has used AI as
far as I know
if you put that tool in my hands you got
problems right so it's a good thing I'm
not you know directly working with it
um
so an interesting tweet I'm going to
assume it's true
I know it's the type of thing that's a
little bit too on the nose so maybe it's
not true but I'm gonna trust them in
this case I'm going to trust it uh
because I want to I guess
but this is a tweet I saw the other day
I said dear Disney
we are a black family and at our
daughter's request we are canceling
Disney plus over uh there's a movie
called The Proud Family and I guess it's
a black family and the Tweet goes on
says she feels beating the daughter she
feels it promotes racism against whites
after looking at it I have to agree with
her and I am so proud of her
now
what happens
when the common enemy is wokeness
because it is the common enemy
and and Americans need a common enemy
like we don't do well when we don't have
an external enemy
right and Russia isn't working for us
like we're all oh yeah yeah you crave
but it's not I wouldn't say it's United
in the country in any way would you
it's not Ukraine does not unite the
country it's just a common or Russia's
sort of a common adverse area I guess
so and even people don't agree whether
Russia is the bad guy or or Ukraine so
it's not really unifying us
but here's my optimistic take
a child born today
literally today
do you think that they will grow up
embracing wokeness
or rejecting it because every every new
generation rejects the thing that was
that their parents did
right if you're born today your parents
are woke
right
if your parents are woke are you going
to be
probably not
I feel like the next generation is going
to erase wokeness and I'm going to go
further and I'll bet I don't know this
some somebody may have made this
prediction before I'm going to make you
the weirdest out of the box prediction
the kids being born today
are the next Boomers
not in terms of numbers probably
the kid the kid's born today are the
next Boomers
they're going to be their grandparents
and great great parents great
grandparents
the Boomers were uh pro-america
and uh anti-victim
right I mean there were more than that
but they were very pro-america and they
were very anti-victim they were not woke
at all the the people born today are
going to be pro-america because it's the
opposite of what what's happening right
now and they're they're going to be
anti-woke because it's the opposite of
what's Happening Now
and as the the prediction is based
entirely on
that the new generation corrects what
the the old generation did in excess
right now I might surprise you if you
haven't heard me say this I'm in favor
of vogness
I'm totally in favor of it I like
wokeness let me say it clearly I like
wokeness
what I don't like is overdoing it
I like drinking water
if I had to drink a barrel of water a
day I wouldn't like it I wouldn't like
it at all
right I like eating potato chips if I
had to eat 100 pounds of potato chips a
day I would like it I wouldn't like it
at all that doesn't make potato chips
not taste good
they're still good
I just don't want too much of it
here's the right amount
everybody everybody has their personal
level here's the right amount of
wokeness for me
somebody prefers to be called by some
name than another name not it doesn't
matter what it is so you could say I
prefer to be called black instead of
African-American
okay
I don't have any problems with that is
it inconvenient for me a little bit
but that's also how Society works right
we we all accept a little bit of
inconvenience like I will hold the door
for you
even though it's a little inconvenient
it's just not very inconvenient I'd
rather hold the door for you
because Society is just a better way to
Greece Society
even though it's a little bit
inconvenient so wokeness to me is like
that there's a little bit of good
wokeness it's a little bit inconvenient
but I like it because I just like being
I I would like people to call me by what
I would like to be called
so if somebody has the same request to
me I say well
she on the other foot I would certainly
want to be called what I consider
respectful
so I would ask the same thing
so somebody asked me that I'm good now
with the pronouns specifically I'm an
anti-pronoun
but I'm Pro calling people what they
want to be called
I just asked that you don't give me a
problem when I say it wrong that's all
right maybe maybe uh clarify for me if I
say wrong oh I prefer you know her or
him
okay
I have no problem with that
but you don't have a problem with me if
I get it wrong that that's that's my
bottom line if I get it wrong
don't give me any problems
not not cool because I'm trying right my
my head's in the right place I'm trying
to give people whatever respect they
think is appropriate within reason
within reason
and those of you who are rejected
fine
yeah those of you say no no no no way
I like it the old way yeah I'm okay with
you too yeah I don't have any problem
with that
all right
um
but I think there's something good
coming from the coming generation
um
Twitter algorithms are so complicated
the Elon Musk apparently uh
concerned
because his own tweets apparently
sometimes would go you know to tens of
millions of people and sometimes to much
smaller number
and he couldn't figure out why
and his Engineers speculated that maybe
it was because some of his tweets were
not
as popular or that people were kind of
over him he wasn't as interesting
anymore
uh musk quite correctly as it turns out
believed that that was BS and that
there's something in the algorithm that
nobody understands
and so he brought together his remaining
Engineers he has not yet fired
and uh this is how it's reported anyway
we don't know it's true we only know
what's reported but what's reported
is that you brought them together and
they could not figure out why his his
tweets get the amount of attention or
lack of attention that they do
now think about that the primary
engineers at Twitter could not figure
out how the algorithm works
for Elon Musk
in other words they could not predict in
advance
that if you put this through the
algorithm it should have a predictable
outcome it appears unpredictable
and it appears too complicated to fix do
you know how they fixed it
they put in some code that forced Elon
musk's tweets to be seen by more people
they had to bypass
their own algorithm because they didn't
understand how it works or how to
correct it
that's what I predicted
that's what I predicted I predicted it
was too complicated and there was no one
person at Twitter who had an idea how
the algorithm Works does anybody
remember me saying that long before musk
took over
does anybody remember me saying that
uh yeah okay so some people remember
yeah so it turns out it's exactly that
it's too complicated for any engineer at
Twitter to actually know if if the
system has been gamed
that was the only thing that made sense
to me from the start
is that the engineers didn't know
themselves they didn't know
now if it's possible to put in this one
line of code that bumps elon's tweets
higher up I think they've adjusted it
since then so that may not be the case
now
but wouldn't that mean that any engineer
who had access could have forced a line
of code in there I don't know if they
catch every line of code or how that
works but could somebody have inserted
some code
without the double checking process
catching it
is that something that could have
happened
or or is any change in the code does it
get flagged to somebody in charge so
they can see the actual lines that have
been added
I would assume it gets flagged
like I can't imagine you could change
the code on the Fly
like it would have to be a process for
you know new patches going in and who
looks at it and all that
but it but but we were surprised or
maybe we weren't
that so many Engineers had access to the
code or the algorithm maybe that's
different
so I guess we still don't know what's
going on there and Elon Musk doesn't but
uh
here's the good news of the bad news
if we can't understand how the algorithm
at Twitter works
it's alive
it's alive
no it really is it's alive
we could kill it
but do you know what makes people appear
alive
what makes us what makes anything appear
alive is that you can't predict what
it's going to do
that's it
you don't know why it does what it does
if human brains were predictable
algorithms
where you knew if I say this to this
person they will respond this exact way
if you knew exactly how a person or an
animal would respond exactly
they would not appear alive
they wouldn't they would appear to be
machines because they would be machines
it's only the complexity and the
unpredictability of our actions that
make us appear alive
Twitter is unpredictable
and appear apparently it exists as an
entity
does it reproduce
apparently it reproduces in the sense
that it grows and it gets new users and
it gets new engagement
and all of those things are like the
system that you know their form the
algorithm and its supporting body you
could say you could say the users and
all the activity outside of the
algorithm are like the body of a person
by analogy again this is not an argument
just an explanation analogies don't work
for arguments only explanations
if you imagine a person is a brain but
then also a body and if you don't take
care of the body you know the brain
can't survive so Twitter
is the algorithm is like the brain
is unpredictable
but the body the company
exists like the body of a human and so
as long as Twitter The Entity exists and
his brain is this algorithm
it's alive
the the I'm watching some people having
a reaction that's not so good yeah
the one thing that we cling to more than
anything as human beings is that we have
a soul and we're special we're not like
machines
we're probably very close as a
civilization to learning that's wrong
and that the only difference between the
Twitter algorithm and you
is how you feel
yeah that's about it but they're both
alive
for all practical purposes you know free
wills and Free Will is an illusion just
as it is with the Twitter algorithm but
if humans and Twitter algorithms are
unpredictable
they're both alive
yeah that's a thinker isn't it
um
here's an update on Ukraine that's
actually uh something I hadn't heard
before something interesting for a
change
now before all of my Ukraine discussions
what do I tell you
I don't say this in tweets so much but I
probably should
um I tell you that you shouldn't believe
anything that you hear about
Ukraine or Russia no I don't believe
that Ukraine is all good and Russia is
all bad no I don't believe that I don't
believe that reasons we got into the War
I don't believe we know who's going to
win I don't believe we know how it'll
turn out
don't believe any of it but it's still
fun to talk about so General Petraeus
who knows more than I do was asked by
Peter Bergen and this is on CNN site
what technologies have proven key to
Ukrainian successes in this war
and
this is interesting
so here are the top four things that
General Petraeus who actually knows what
he's talking about as opposed to me this
is what he says we're the top
technologies that are making a
difference
number one uh Elon musk's satellite
system
Elon Musk is one of the top four
technologies that allow Ukraine to stay
in the fight starlink
the Elon Musk is again
one of the most important people in the
world
because he built starlink
so that's number one
number two is the high Mars system you
have the highly precise rockets and I
think Whoever has the most precise
Rockets wins
I mean it's just
so it used to be in the old days that
um if you could see something you you
could destroy it
but that wasn't as true as it is today
because the drones can see anything on
the Russian side they spot anything
worth destroying and now we can put a
missile right on it
so at this point
we can see and destroy
anything they want not we the ukrainians
the ukrainians can see
with drones and then put a missile right
on it as often as they want to all day
long and probably not run out of
missiles
I don't know how you lose I'm not sure
how you could lose in that situation but
I suppose the other side could have
overwhelming you know artillery and make
a difference all right so the other
technology is uh Clear View AI
do you remember Clear View AI it's a an
app that law enforcement uses to
identify people now not every law
enforcement
uses it because it's controversial
people complain that they you know
scraped data and that's there's a
privacy problem and blah blah blah
um but
it works really well
it the
it works really well just trust me it
works well so apparently the ukrainians
are using it to tell who the Russians
are so that they don't have any spies or
uh
people pretending to be ukrainians
do you know how valuable that is in a
war between ukrainians and Russians an
app where you can tell which side
they're on
by their face
think about that
I mean think about that imagine if they
couldn't tell
all the things that Russia could do to
them
if they could just slip their Russians
in as ukrainians and get behind the
lines but now they can just hold the
phone up and they know if you're a
Russian Defector or the Spy
that's that's you know kind of an
amazing technology then the other thing
is the Turkish armed drones
that I guess the ukrainians are using uh
have been devastating to Russian targets
and then also the cheap commercial
drones
so
um it looks like it's going to be a
stalemate forever
because the ukrainians have better stuff
and maybe better training and they're
more motivated the Russians have the
ability to throw unlimited you know
bodies into any situation so it looks
like it's just going to be a tie for a
long time you know little one town going
back and forth but totally destroyed
whenever it happens nobody wants to live
there anymore
yeah So eventually I guess it has to be
negotiated but not until everybody's in
enough pain but that'll come
ukrainians were Manpower is uh
decreasing true at the same time that
their Precision missiles are increasing
so if they're Precision missiles
increase
they can they can lose a lot of people
and still be okay
you just said whoever has the most
precise Rockets wins yeah all things
being equal
so if you have the same amount of people
on the precise Rockets would win but if
you had unlimited people
that you're willing to to kill then that
can be an equalizer but yes I I was
unclear about that
uh
don't you think Sean Penn hopes he gets
assassinated so he can die like a
dictator martyr
I wonder about that sometimes
uh carpet bombing yeah that would work
um
Russian mothers will decide the war well
apparently the Russians the Russian
public is completely uninterested
you you know what would make a Russian
citizen uninterested in the war
telling them that only the dangerous
prisoners are fighting oh don't worry
about it we're just sending your
prisoners
uh I think I think if this country
fought a war and you believed
incorrectly but if you believed that the
fighters were mostly prisoners from you
know who had done serious crimes you
probably wouldn't even care
honestly you probably wouldn't
you should but I bet you wouldn't
all right all right
is there any uh topic that I didn't talk
about this worth talking about so I
don't do the earthquakes and the
um shootings
I ignore those because you got plenty of
that you don't need to hear
all right
does it feel like there's some big news
coming
do you feel like that
I feel like there's something coming I
guess there always is so that's like a
generic thing to say
but maybe even if there's nothing
important coming
it will look like it's important
um
World War III I I would say the odds of
nuclear war are vanishingly small
because Putin doesn't need it
he doesn't need it
I think keeping Putin in in office
pretty much guarantees no nuclear war
because I think he would settle for a
stalemate
at the moment Putin is not not bothered
by his uh domestic
um
you know unhappiness all right so Putin
has no domestic problem at home
right he doesn't have a domestic problem
he's not running out of money because
apparently they can sell their energy to
other places
so he has money
he has domestic support
and he has a strategy which we'll end up
with him controlling probably
some percentage of important strategic
land that he can call a success why
would he nuke us
there's no upside to that
he basically his his worst case scenario
at this point looks like he stays in
office Russia stays stable
the domestic people
and he gets a little extra land and you
know he gets to keep Crimea or something
whatever whatever we negotiate we
meaning the world and Ukraine
so no we're not even close to nuclear
war we're probably further from nuclear
war than
you know well I won't say we're further
but
now as far as China why in the world
would China want to Nuke us
you realize that would be insane right
that would be like nuking themselves I
mean they would end up getting nuked but
China still requires us to exist for
them to exist
at the moment China can't exist
successfully without the United States
also existing because right now they
depend on our on our technology and our
markets
if they nuke us how are they better off
there's no scenario in which Russia or
China
could even conceivably imagine that
launching a nuclear weapon would be in
their best interest now the thing that
protects us
is that although she
and Putin
are both evil bastards
nobody suggests that they're unstable
Minds
right everybody knows that they're
working for the best interests of
themselves and their countries maybe the
country's second
but as long as there's a stable logical
smart capable people and they seem to be
how evil they are probably won't matter
because they're still in it for their
self-interest
and their self-interest has no
no no no connection to using a nuclear
weapon that could not possibly be a
self-interest
Hillary was probably crazy from the
start and we're not suggesting that the
leaders of Russia or China are crazy
you call the Ukrainian Expedition
logical yes
yes because Russia will probably come
out with some extra strategic goals
Putin will probably look good because of
it or he'll make sure that the history
reports he looks good
yeah it looks like it worked because
remember Putin doesn't care too much
about his casualties
so yeah looks like he's working for him
I mean not it's not working as well as
he wanted but he's gonna guess of land
and he'll be able to sell that as a whim
uh Iran and North Korea same situation
so
Kim Jong-un in North Korea
has his own little you know Mafia kind
of situation why would he want to ruin
it
there's literally and by the way Kim
Jong-un doesn't seem crazy to me
I I don't I don't see him he's not
acting crazy at all
so the good news is we don't seem to
have any crazy leaders who have nukes
Iran is a special case but they don't
act that crazy
yeah even the Iranian
um you know religious
higher level uh considerations it
doesn't get you to that level of
craziness
Biden yeah even Biden's not crazy enough
to Nuke
here are the things I think you should
not worry about number one
do not worry about getting nuked we're
not we're not anywhere in that worry
Zone nowhere near it
number two
don't worry that there's a ongoing War
to destroy all our
food sources and infrastructure
there are definitely a bunch of strange
things happening in that domain but
there's nothing to tie them together to
you know any particular for info
and certainly our foreign foes are maybe
trying to influence those things that
are hurting us just as we might be doing
the same with them but we're not aware
of it so that sort of business as usual
we'll work that out my take on all the
things that are falling apart
is that we're just at that point in the
country's age where things start to
crumble if you're not if you're not
funding them and maintaining them so
some of it's just the normal
life cycle of stuff
and some of it is that the news is
surfacing stories to make it look like a
pattern where maybe you didn't notice it
before let me ask you this
if the only thing you knew about what's
happening in the country
was from the mainstream corporate news
would you believe that there's some kind
of attack on the infrastructure
because I think it takes social media to
keep surfacing it so you it looks like
more of a pattern
you would say you would say yes if you
watched Fox News but here's the trick
Fox News is influenced by social media
right if social media were not making a
big deal of the fact that it looks like
some kind of coordinated attack do you
think Tucker Carlson would talk about it
I don't think so
I think only because social media sees
it as a thing that the news says it's a
thing or it might be a thing where
people think it's a thing but you take
away the social media the corporate news
would just talk about whatever they
wanted to talk about and you wouldn't
even notice pattern you're just like oh
a lot of things get attacked that'd be
all that's all you think about
um the attacks look like Insurance scams
Maybe
um
yeah
Ford battery China connection
um I don't know the details of that
story
well we'll think consider this uh if
there are really been a thousand
derailments in the past year
I think Tucker said that
that is that track it feels like too
high
and maybe maybe derailment has all kinds
of different levels you know maybe
there's some kind of minor derailment
where nobody gets hurt
700 average per year so that if it's
1700 per year there must be a big
category of minor derailments that you
never hear about
right
because it probably doesn't happen on
the open lines it probably happens like
in the the rail yard or something where
things get switched around I've got a
feeling that that number is misleading
while not necessarily being wrong
oh you think that they meant the number
of cars derailed
oh
but still is too many
it feels still too many
so
imagine imagine if this Ohio train had
not happened
so let's say the Ohio derailment never
happened the one with the chemical spill
if you had never heard of that one
you also never would have heard of the
other 1700.
and you wouldn't even be aware there was
any kind of pattern
so you were one trained derailment away
from not knowing that any trained
derailments happen do you know what I
would have guessed
per year
if you'd said guess how many train
derailments there are in the United
States per year
I would have said on average
one
I would have guessed that there are
several years in a row when done
you know sort of like plane accidents I
would I would have guessed like plane
accidents there could be years with none
and then the other to be one
and maybe in a weird case it'll be two
but basically I would have guessed one
1700 doesn't sound slightly believable
to me
but imagine that you never would have
heard of them without that one the Ohio
one without Ohio you would still think
it's either one maybe three
yeah hot pocket I agree with you they're
they're probably more you know technical
derailments at the train yard where it's
all you know slow and you can correct it
more easily probably that makes sense
yeah derailment doesn't mean crash
correct derailment could mean they just
immediately stop and then figure out how
to fix it
um you said derailments caused by shunts
you believe that there were 1700
derailments
caused by the that trick where they put
a wire across the rail somehow and they
short out something
no if that were the case that would be
the biggest story in the country
wouldn't it yeah wouldn't we have like a
massive FBI Department working on that
and how in the world can they not figure
out who's doing that when we can figure
out who does anything
how in the world are there not already
trail cams on all the real real loans
railroad sections
uh oh hold on here let's see a
derailment can be caused by Collision
um
uh many derailments are minor this is
from Wikipedia
yeah so there are many derailments are
minor that's what we I guess that's what
we knew
of those 400 is caused by okay of a
thousand per year according to the
Federal Railroad Administration of the
thousands per year 400 caused by track
defects
um another five or six hundred by human
error
okay
um why are the residents of Palestinian
Ohio not getting Palestine Ohio not
getting hotel rooms for free
I don't know maybe they don't have any
I can't imagine there's a whole lot of
Hotel business in that town
the chemicals were not to be on those
tracks
is that the story
is there a story that those chemicals
should not be
that should not have been transported on
those tracks
I don't know about that one
oh okay all right I'm gonna run I gotta
go Goodbye YouTube I'll see you later
best YouTube uh live stream you've seen
today
