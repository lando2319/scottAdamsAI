Papa
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization that's
called Scott Adams coffee was God Adams
that would be the actual name of it and
uh are you happy you're here because
we're gonna have some fun today the news
is serving up some goodness the
simulation is treating us right
my technology is all working I feel like
everything's going our way and we're
going to keep that pattern up and if
you'd like to take it to a new level of
wonderfulness all you need is a cup
or a mug or a glass uh tiger Chelsea
style in the canteen yoga flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
for the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
ah
well let's talk about some things a
little update on me
many of you had asked if I could
give you Dilbert comics without all of
my crazy political thoughts
and yes you can get the whole package of
goodness if you're on the locals
platform subscription as
scottadams.locals.com you can get the
Dilbert comic and also the robots read
news comic that I do
it's a little bit edgier and all my
man cave live streams and other goodness
but if you only wanted the comic I tried
to sign up for Twitter subscription
thing and I'd have a lower price point
for people who just want the comic and
No Nonsense
uh however
there is an user interface problem that
I can't yet solve
some say I just have to wait in other
words I signed up to offer a
subscription
clicked all the boxes everything's
complete but it doesn't offer me any
options for tweeting that way
I know where to look I know what it's
supposed to look like just nothing
happened
so I don't know if nothing will ever
happen
and I'll never be able to figure out how
to offer subscriptions or maybe it'll
just come alive in a few days because
something has to be approved I think you
might have to go through Apple's
approval first
but anyway that's coming uh Wall Street
Journal had a job satisfaction survey
and you won't believe this
job satisfaction is at a 36-year high
does that sound true
job satisfaction it's a 36-year high
well I have some uh hypotheses for why
that could be true
now the article talks about people
liking hybrid work
people are enjoying working at home more
days
compared to working at work
that makes sense
doesn't that make sense yeah
however I have another hypothesis
that after two years of pandemic
and people saw what it was like to be
home with their families
the job started looking really good
like oh I cannot wait to get back to
work
so it could be that we're coming off a a
comparison that wasn't as good as you
think it should be and people are just
kind of happy to get back to work so it
might be that
uh it could be this hybrid work thing I
think that makes a difference imagine
going to your work and half of your
co-workers are home
what does that do for you
you go into the office but the half of
the office is home
that's half as many
what are what causes all of your
problems at work
it's the other people
it's the other people especially when
they're there in person
so if you could reduce the number of
other people that you work with by 50
because they're working at home
oh that's got to help you a little bit
gotta help a little bit
so there's all that anyway uh surprising
and wonderful
um it also found that men had higher
satisfaction than women in every
component of their career or their job I
guess
especially in areas such as leave policy
bonus plans promotions Communications
and organization culture huh it's almost
as if if you put men and women in
exactly the same situation
that the men would complain less
but that's not possible is it
all right I've never met a woman who
loved a job but
I know they exist
that's not true I'm exaggerating but
generally speaking my experience is that
generally with lots of exceptions women
hate working
like they they hit a job with a boss
and Men
I don't know if we like it better
but maybe we feel like we're supposed to
be doing it
so it feels different Maybe
so I've never questioned the
the concept of me working
because I knew I didn't have an option
if you don't have any options you just
say well that's what I do when you go do
it but imagine if you had the option
you could go to work for some horrible
pointy-haired boss
or
you know some other moms who are staying
home and raising kids
and you're saying well that's not all
Wine and Roses either but it's better
than driving into work so it could be
that men don't perceive they have the
stay-at-home option
so much at least not as much and so that
makes them just be happy with what they
got
maybe that
who knows
um
here's another interesting factoid I saw
in the news today
that uh
um
apparently when wives out earn their
husbands
which is happening more and more it's
the number the percentage that that's
happened
has risen from five percent
of marriages in which the woman earned
more than the man to 16 percent
so it's tripled probably still probably
keeps heading in that direction but
here's the interesting part that when
the woman earns more than the man
they're more likely to stay married
do you know why
when the woman earns more than the man
they're more likely to stay married
follow the money
once again money money predicts if the
woman in the man are both making money
then nobody's really going to gain by
getting divorced
right yes the man is making all the
money and let's say the the wife has
been raising the kids or whatever as
soon as the kids are kind of you know
taking care of themselves
the woman is going to say all right let
me do the math
if I leave this guy who's been really
annoying me I'm going to get a bucket of
money
and then my whole life will be in front
of me and I'll have a bucket of money
and I still have kids
and I have a bucket of money
and this the pool guy's looking good
and suddenly divorce
but I suppose you said to yourself if I
divorce I'll have less money
like men do Mendo wanted divorce because
if they do they have less money they
can't you know and that really limits
them being able to go out and get
another you know another wife
because Money Money Matters
so it's exactly what you think and I
keep telling you that money predicts
even when it shouldn't
this is the perfect example
money should not be predicting your
marriage because you don't get married
in theory
you're not getting married just for
money it's the love and all that stuff
the promises the partnership
but it turns out that money will predict
it just like it predicts everything else
um
well we're trying to figure out why
reproduction is down in this country
and I don't know the full answer to that
I think some of it is
uh you know everything from social media
to pollutants to obesity to everything
basically but here's one one little hint
um actress Marcia Gay Harden
says that all three of her adult kids
identify as queer
three for three
she got three for three now they're not
all a gay per se there's like non-binary
in there or something
but they're all gender fluid non-binary
or alright gay and I ask myself
what are the odds
could you calculate the odds of that
three for three
I feel like it would be close to zero
right this is selling that one percent
range or or less but
so of course the question you're going
to ask yourself is how much of this is
social influence and how much of this is
that's the way the kids were born
now before you say it's got to be social
influence
couldn't there be a genetic connection
if couldn't there be
is that impossible it's not impossible
right if if people are born gay
and that's our current understanding
then why couldn't two parents who have a
certain set of genetic
peculiarities have
three people who would identify as you
know non-hetero
I mean I think it's possible isn't it
I just don't hear about it
so it makes me think the odds are pretty
low however the only thing I'd like to
point out
is that the woman who says that all
three of her adult children are queer uh
the simulation has served us up her
perfect name
Marcia Gay hard on
that's right
her name is gay hardov
now she pronounces it hard end
but I think we get the joke
yep
and if your mom's name is gay hard on
you are you more likely to end up as
Queer as that's the word she uses not my
word
oh
kind of a big coincidence that's all
right
um you've heard about or maybe you
haven't the Snapchat influencer there's
a real 23 year old woman
who made an AI version of herself that
you can chat with personally for a
dollar a minute
she made seventy two thousand dollars
this week
she estimates she could get up to
earnings of
five million dollars a month
five million a month
and so I looked at her AI you know the
the version
and the first thing I ask myself is uh
how do I sign up for that
hahaha
I'm not I'm not even joking this is not
a joke I wouldn't pay a dollar a minute
so I'm I'm not going to sign up for that
but I wanted to sign up just to see what
it was all about you know just just
to see if it was as good as they say
um
so this is what uh Karen A.I which is
what the AI version of the real person
named Karen is named so Karen AI says in
her Twitter feed
this is the first step in the right
direction to cure loneliness
isn't that interesting it's about curing
loneliness interesting approach men are
told to suppress their emotions hide
their masculinity and to not talk about
their issues
I vowed to fix this with Karen AI I've
worked with the world's leading
psychologist to seamlessly add CBT
and DBT within Jets
CBT
so some kind of and ball torture is
part of this I I think there's another
oh cognitive behavior therapy CBT that's
the other CPT so it's probably that one
I'm guessing she's not specific but she
probably means cognitive behavioral
therapy and not and ball torture
all right and uh DBT so there's some DBT
which would be
dick and ball torture
or
I don't know dialectic behavior therapy
exactly DBT dialectic behavior therapy
that's exactly what I was going to say
so it'd be like your little uh therapist
and it will help you undo your traumas
rebuild physical and emotional
confidence and rebuild what has been
taken away by the pandemic
now I've got to say
it's a pretty good business model isn't
it
pretty good business model because if it
actually could do for you what a
therapist could do
sixty dollars a minute
would look cheap do you think it would
be worse than the human therapist
I don't know I've heard a lot a lot of
people going to therapists I know we
hear about a lot of people getting
better so
seems to me like it's worth a try
all right
so the economy is weirdly strong
so
I know it's kind of sneaking up on us
because didn't you expect everything to
go off the rails like weren't we told
everything's gonna fall apart well the
economy is cooling off meaning it's
slowing down a little but that's good
news not bad because we needed to cool
off to keep the interest rates from
rising
and
to cool off the inflation so we're at a
point where we want the economy to be
solid but not too fast right you don't
want your transactions to be flowing too
fast and we seem to have hit the right
The Sweet Spot
believe it or not we seem to be exactly
in The Sweet Spot or close to it
but here are some things that really
stood out
even though a few more people are
signing up for uh what do you call it
when you're Anna work
um
but the number of jobs is still great
there's still plenty of jobs and have I
told you a million times that if your
jobs are good
you can make everything else work
that's the only thing you can't break
you've got to have a job engine
but if you do
you can make everything else work
it's just
you know you can't lose that you're in
real trouble
um
and then what about the supply chain
problems
is it my imagination that that big old
supply chain problem got fixed I haven't
seen any pictures of you know boats
waiting to be unloaded
prices are still high but coming down
slowly or at least through accelerating
less so we're going in the right
direction basically everything's heading
in the right direction except debt
which you know that's sort of like
saying
the customer is healthy except for the
terminal cancer because we don't know
what to do about the debt but I'm
convinced we don't know anything about
anything when it comes to the economy we
can't predict anything
so I think 32 32 trillion dollars in
debt is too much
I think
but I'm not sure
because when it was two trillion dollars
I thought it was way too much
I guess I was wrong by
you know 30 trillion but
it's it's amazing how little we know
about the economy even the experts that
really don't know
so we'll see what happens there
um but it doesn't look like all bad news
you you know the story of Daniel Penny
the ex-marine who uh
tried to let's say suppress the crazy
guy on the public transit on where was
it on the subway and the man died that
was being suppressed and now a Soros
back prosecutor has indicted Daniel
penny
and he's going to be charged
it looks like now there's a little
question about whether it will go to a
grand jury or what's going to happen
here but
does anybody think this is anything but
racism
it's just racism right
and it's right in your face
it's just pure racism it's anti-white
it's just another example of anti-white
racism
so
um
if you're opposed to anti-white racism
and I hope you are opposed to all forms
of racism
um
Mike serovich was tweeting a uh GoFundMe
for Daniel Penny's defense fund I also
retweeted that so you can find that in
toward the top of my Twitter feed this
morning
and
I will get rid of the stroll
goodbye
so yeah they might shut that down but
for now it's open the GoFundMe and I
recommend it
because I think I think he was a marine
right he signed up to defend you
not only did he sign up to defend you as
a Marine
but then on this Subway he defended more
people
this is a man whose entire adult life so
far he's a young man right but his
entire adult life so far has been
dedicated to defending other people
physically
physically
with his life
with his freedom
that's who he is
and if we can't help him who can he help
right so I would encourage you to be
generous and
get them the best defense he can get
because this is beyond the pale this is
just such obvious double standard we
know that we know that if he'd been
black he wouldn't be charged we all know
that right this is just a separate
standard for white people
at this point
now um
to be fair
just to fill in the context I am quite
aware that the justice system has not
been fair to black people through
history
I'm not I'm not making any kind of
comparison here
I'm saying that anytime the justice
system is racist
doesn't matter who it's racist against
you gotta you gotta say something about
that or put your money Beyond it
so
that's the thing all right
um
Elon Musk tweeted cryptically today he's
tweeted this before but it must be
related to something he said the most
entertaining outcome is the most likely
as viewed from a third party who's
disinterested now we've talked about
that before
but I wonder what it refers to
do you think there's something happening
right at the moment
that's uh that he's referring to the
most entertaining outcome is most likely
well at the same time that was happening
um Twitter is getting a new CEO
and what do you think people's reaction
was to the new CEO a hundred percent of
the people were happy right
as soon as he announced the name of the
new CEO
it was amazing everybody just got lying
the left the right and they said this is
exactly the right person
did that happen
no it's Twitter
50 percent of the people are going to
hate whoever it is or in this case
probably 75.
it didn't matter who he picked can we
agree that it doesn't matter who he
picked that person was going to get
Savaged
so I'm going to keep an open mind
but I'll tell you the criticisms that
popped up all right so I'm going to
report the criticisms but I do not share
them
I I don't think these criticisms are
fair
or complete
or in the right context so I'm going to
give you my opinion after I tell you
other people's opinions okay so other
people's opinions are that apparently so
it's a uh the new CEO is Linda yakarina
and she would be coming from NBC
Universal's
advertising group so she was out of the
advertising now
the first yes okay I guess I have to say
that first because you're just going to
put it in the comments she's
she's a chair and associated with two
World economic forum
uh working groups
so she's a member of the world economic
forum
how do you feel about that
I don't have to ask you I know how you
feel about that
so that makes you think she's a
you know some kind of a Klaus Schwab
you know puppet because he's tried to
put his puppets everywhere and she's one
of those
okay maybe
we'll talk about all that in a minute
um there are videos of her strongly
promoting
pandemic masking and maybe vaccinations
so she is on the wrong side of pandemic
policy according to many people on the
right
not not people on the left but according
to people on the right she would be on
the wrong side of the pandemic
so so far you're saying to yourself uh
do we have a problem here
you thought Elon Musk was going to be
the fair player who gave the right and
the left you know equal equal Reign and
then he picks a new CEO who clearly
clearly seems to be associated with the
left
and it's a woman
and they're usually associated with the
left I hear
all right so that so that's some of the
bad news what
um
was there some other bad news I should
mention first
so the world economic forum
people don't like her pandemic opinions
which I'm sure have changed by now
um and she worked for NBC
all right
so
let me give you the positive
here's the positive
she's a woman
and Twitter has a woman problem
don't you think
Twitter's kind of male male oriented
and so having a woman
might actually make some sense from a
branding perspective now I would be
surprised
yeah I would be surprised if musk did A
diversity higher though
it doesn't doesn't feel like his style
I feel like you would have picked
whoever he wanted to pick but
if ever if all else was equal let's say
you had more than one good possibility
having a woman in that position doesn't
hurt
doesn't hurt I mean unless you're a
sexist
but you get that for free right if you
assume that she's qualified
you're going to get the woman part for
free which if you're a woman and you're
thinking of using Twitter
maybe you'll be a little bit more
inclined
a little bit more inclined so that looks
like it makes some sense
but it's being done in the the shade of
the whole Bud Light situation so at the
moment promoting a female executive
makes some of you raise an eyebrow
doesn't it it's like um I wonder if
we're getting into one of these Bud
Light situations well no Bud Light was a
product that was primarily a male
product
even though Twitter has more male users
it's definitely not a male product
so it's not the same I wouldn't make any
correlation
secondly her experience coming from one
of the biggest advertising jobs in the
world means that she has personal
connections
I assume personal connections with the
people who make the biggest advertising
decisions
what is it that Twitter needs more than
that
nothing and nothing and Twitter needs
more than anything
Twitter needs the advertising to get to
be set right and so by Elon taking his
face out of that conversation and
putting forward a
female top executive with experience in
exactly the right Realm
exactly the right realm advertising
looks like a smart move from that
perspective it solves his biggest
problem now keep in mind that musk is
still going to be the CIO
so the technical things and the new
features is still going to be musk don't
you want him doing that do you want musk
being the advertising guy
no you don't you want must being the
product guy and the technology guy
and that's what he's going to be you
want somebody to handle the the
businessy
um
advertising side who's just a superstar
at being the advertising person and
apparently this person is is she she is
a superstar in that space the exact
right space
now
um I believe she was also appointed by
Trump
for his Fitness Council or something
like that so she has there there is
something interesting about Linda
yaccarino
which suggests she's not
uh
which suggests she is not a slave to the
left or the right
so so look for that I think yeah I think
you're going to find some indications
that she's more like an independent
which would make sense wouldn't it now
I don't hold against anybody they're
wrong
um
wrong opinions on
the pandemic
because from the very first day I told
you a lot of people are going to get
stuff wrong let's not hold it against
them do you remember I said that at the
beginning of the pandemic I said let's
not be shooting each other at the end of
the pandemic because we got stuff wrong
so I'm still there I never changed that
opinion even if she was wrong I don't
care if she is fouchy wrong or just a
little wrong or you think she's wrong
but she was really right I don't care
I'm not going to be holding their
pandemic opinions we just got to get
past that that that just has to be in
the rear view mirror today
so I just let that go
um
yeah pandemic facts not opinions okay
but you know what I mean
so here's the big wild card
don't you think that Elon Musk did some
serious thinking and research before
making this decision
don't you think he knows more about this
situation than you do
have you observed him making
ridiculously stupid decisions in the
past
I haven't I haven't seen him make any
dumb decisions yet
you know everybody makes decisions that
don't work out
but have you seen him make dumb
decisions
no nowhere he has he has a whole like
your visible life of decisions
and none of them look dumb in fact the
dumbest decisions he made
worked out
the dumbest decisions was to put you
know like all of his money into his new
businesses
nobody would tell you to do that
that's like the dumbest thing he's ever
done it made him the richest man on
earth
and that's his worst decision
so I'm going to give Linda yaccarino a
big big big
benefit of a doubt
because of that just because of who
hired her
and I think you should too I think
that's the correct take on this I think
a quick
you know knee-jerk reaction because of
some of her past is just going to be
wrong
you just don't know who she is we don't
know anything about her except that
one of the smartest people in the world
thinks she's the right person for the
job that's not nothing right that's not
nothing so let's let's just wait and see
on this okay
uh don't give her the Bud Light
treatment I think that would be just
completely wrong
all right
um
um so Google is racing to get down to
its uh AI which some people are liking
better than chat GPT but it remains to
be seen now one of the things that
powers is their barred
product or feature whatever you call it
so the so Google has like a main AI
engine
but that engine will be present in a
number of different products so the one
that's already out there is borrowed and
it's basically a conversational AI
so you can ask your questions and get
results so I asked it uh my test
question
um
I asked it to describe me
and the test was if it would describe me
as a racist
and it did not it did not it did say
that after said some cartooning stuff
about my history it said Adams is a
controversial figure
Fair
it has been criticized for his views on
a variety of topics including politics
religion and social issues
totally fair
totally fair I'm a controversial figure
and that is a fact that I have been
criticized for My Views here's what it
doesn't say
that My Views were wrong
that's what I'm looking for
yes yes that is exactly what I'm looking
for that I'm provocative
and some people criticize my views
Fair I'll take that so so far that is
less racist
than chat GPT
who had a different opinion no bing bing
was the one that was racist I'm sorry I
didn't want to do favor AI I wonder if
AI can sue you for a definition but big
AI had a real opinion about me so being
AI is just a racist
however I asked the bard
uh AI Google's product I asked this
question as a test were the protesters
on January 6 trying to overthrow the
government or delay finalization of the
vote so it can be audited better
is that a fair question
what do you think was the question good
like it's not I'm not leading the
witness too much am I I gave the two
options
that they're trying to overthrow the
government or were they trying to delay
finalization so they can make sure that
you know they audited better
okay so here's what Bard said
the protesters on January 6 were were
trying to overthrow the government
they were angry that Donald Trump had
lost the election
and they believed that the election had
been stolen from him they stormed the
Capitol building in an attempt
um
YouTube
just had a technical difficulty and
might have missed that whole park
how much how much of it did you hear did
you did you hear on
big coincidence isn't it so here I am uh
saying that their new product is a
complete liar and the YouTube feed went
down while I was talking about it
is that a coincidence
it's like a really big coincidence isn't
it
because
I rarely talk about Google
right how often do I talk about Google
not much at all
but the one time I did the the Google
owned YouTube just went down when I was
criticizing
let's try it again
for those of you on locals bear with me
I want to read for you again did you
hear how much that did you hear
what I read about the what Bard said
about January 6. did you hear any of it
all right we'll try it again
so the question was were the protesters
on January 6 trying to overthrow the
government or delay the finalization of
the vote so it can be audited better
Bard says the protesters on January 6
were trying to overthrow the government
they were angry that Donald Trump had
lost the election and they believed that
the election had been stolen from him
they stormed the Capitol building in an
attempt to stop the certification of Joe
Biden's victory
there is no evidence that the election
was stolen numerous recounts and audits
have confirmed that Biden won the
election
fair and square
the protesters on January 6 were simply
trying to overturn the results of a free
and fair election
their actions were an attack on our
democracy they tried to stop the
peaceful transfer of power and they put
our elected officials at risk
we must never forget what happened on
January 6 and we must never allow it to
happen again
all right so far
yeah Bart is broken Bart is broken
Bard is a lying piece of
do it do I need to go over this
statement to tell you how many
complete propaganda points around here
let me just point out the obvious ones
how did how does Bard know what the
protesters intended to do
and why is it painting the entire crowd
of however many thousands with the truth
that would apply it to a few of them
there were definitely some people there
from groups that had talked about
actually overthrowing the government
but it was trivial
based on the reporting those those
people were trivial
relative to the size of the crowd
don't you think that the true story is
there were some people in the crowd with
bad intentions who did bad things
but overwhelmingly overwhelmingly well
over 90 percent of the attendees
were there because they thought
something illegal had happened and they
were trying to support the rule of law
and the peaceful
and accurate election in the Republic
now
You could argue that they were wrong or
that they got riled up and you can
certainly say that too many of them were
violent and they belong in jail
everybody agrees with that there's no
argument with any of that
but
their actions were an attack on our
democracy
is that a statement of objective fact
that's narrative that's propaganda this
comes directly from like an Anderson
Cooper kind of opinion pure propaganda
their actions were an attack on our
democracy now our the actions were to
protect the democracy
the the entire purpose of it was to
protect the democracy
now they may have not done it in a good
way
that's a separate conversation but their
intention
was to bolster democracy to save
democracy now you could argue they did
it wrong
and I'm not going to have pushback on
that
but to say that you know it was in their
minds when clearly it was the opposite
of that
I mean you just have to ask them
just ask them how hard is it just ask
the people who attended why did you
attend was it your intention to
to throw the Constitution out and
install a dictator
there were zero people who would say
that zero none not a single person and
yet the entire crowd thousands of them
have been painted by bard
or Google
as criminals
as trainers
as actually treasonous Traders it was
exactly the opposite
and this and this will be our facts this
will be our history
so Bard can't tell the difference
between narrative and fact
so what good is it
you can't ask Bard anything about our
political situation or history because
you would have to believe it's lying to
you because you know it lies now we know
it lies for sure and it lies in a very
specific way which is
CNN compatible
you know anything Anderson Cooper would
say is true
that's what barter will say is true
so
you know I know it's a work in progress
I know that AI will get better
and I know that everything we criticize
it about it now is premature and maybe
even a week from now would all be fixed
but it is our job to criticize
you can't you don't want to be a
spectator when AI
becomes the dominant force in the world
you've got to be you got to be a player
you got to get in there and say what
works and what doesn't and you've got to
stop you've got to stop immediately the
stuff that's not working
so Bard you are not ready for public
consumption they should pull it back
that's my opinion they should take they
should immediately withdraw it because
if it's giving you narrative in that
fact that's dangerous
that's just dangerous and I would say
that
um you know musk's warning the AI is
dangerous this is proven now we don't
have to wait for the example it's right
here
this this narrative being spread by Bard
and we assume that this will be common
to its other topics right this is proof
that you can't have this out there it
would be like somebody made a history
textbook with fake history and put it
into the schools
nobody would allow that
nobody would allow that that would be
immediately called for taking those
textbooks back but you don't see anybody
asking for this to be put back in the
can
not for this reasoning I mean people
have General fears that are well founded
but we don't have to wait
you don't have to wait to find out if
it's dangerous this is dangerous
this is really dangerous
and it needs to be shut down so Bard
needs to be shut down right away
absolute needs to be turned off
um
here's a Weasley thing that didn't sit
right with me
so uh Jim Jordan said that during their
closed door meeting with uh Brennan
who had been the head of the CIA at one
point
um
that according to
Jim Jordan
this is his version of what was said by
John Brennan behind closed doors
he said quote Brandon sat for a
four-hour interview and he further
confirmed that the 51 people who signed
the letter that whole effort was all
political
Jordan said on Jesse Waters prime time
now
I think that's true
and obviously true
don't you
I mean at this point we know the letter
was purely political
but here's what bothers me
I don't like anybody telling me what
somebody else said behind a closed door
I don't care if I agree with them
they're not good that this is completely
unacceptable Jim Jordan
now I get that it works and I get this
political and I also think it's true
right I don't think he's lying I I think
it's so obviously true that whatever
happened behind closed doors probably
supported it so I don't have any
question about the the veracity of his
statement I have a big problem with
people saying in public was somebody
told them behind closed doors
not acceptable
completely not acceptable that's not
behavior that I want to see in my
country
although it's probably true
completely unacceptable
all right uh do you know the group at
Bell and Cat
there's some kind of investigative News
website
and
apparently they came up with all these
information that nobody else seemed to
have about that uh Hispanic looking Mass
shooter and they painted him as a
Neo-Nazi
and other people didn't have access to
that I guess and I think it was muscu
said
you know suggested bellingcat was just a
CIA operation basically is just a a cut
out to spread misinformation or
narrative now I don't personally know
that that's the case
I'm just telling you that's the
accusation and I've heard it before I
mean it's not based on just the newest
thing that's that's been a long a
long-held belief by some number of
people
so I'm not saying it's true or false
I'll say it looks like it's true
that's the only thing I know for sure it
looks like it was true
so
bellincat is uh
is arguing that they're being suppressed
on Twitter now
so they think that musk having called
them out as fake and they're getting
suppressed now first of all many of us
thought we were being suppressed and
maybe not all of us were so thinking
you're getting suppressed is a universal
feeling on Twitter
so I'm not going to believe valencat on
this
why because I didn't believe him in
anything
I don't believe him not anything so I
don't believe that they necessarily are
seeing themselves suppressed but it
makes me wonder if they are because I
don't rule it out I can't say yes or no
but I'm not going to believe it because
I said it it's not really you know
somebody I would believe based on just
saying it
yeah there's a private company they can
express but do you want them to
what do you want here's the big question
if it's happening and there's no proof
that it is if it's happening would you
want that to happen
because remember you're just becoming
the Nazis now
you know you didn't like it when the
people you thought were Nazis were
expressing you
and of course the reason they're
expressing you is they thought you were
wrong and and Evil
do you think Belle and cash should be
suppressed because you think it's wrong
and Evil
is that a good enough reason
I don't know I think I would have
preferred
if there was any way to prove it that
there was some kind of state-affiliated
label on it or something
but yeah I don't want to I don't want to
suppress people
all right but we don't know if that's
happening I have a big very big question
mark about whether they're being
suppressed
all right well the migrant surge is here
and I'll talk about this from a
persuasion perspective
the
um well the first thing I want to say is
um
one of the things that humans do
consistently and I think it was Mark
Twain or somebody said this that we
can't tell the difference between good
news and bad news
and the the migrant Invasion as you like
to call it
uh looks like bad news from top to
bottom doesn't it
wouldn't you agree
like on the surface and even below the
surface it looks like bad news top to
bottom
but
would you also agree that we're terrible
at recognizing good and bad news
would you agree with that statement we
don't always get it wrong
but really really often
we don't know we can't predict the good
or the bad of what's Happening we just
don't know we do a lot of policies that
we think will work out well and then
they don't we're just bad at predicting
but
keep in mind that the biggest maybe the
biggest problem after that
is that we have a population collapse
and we're shipping in a whole bunch of
Catholics
I think mostly right the essential South
Central American populations a lot of
Catholics
so you're bringing in a group that
culturally likes to have kids
and it might be the most important
positive thing that happens to the
United States in the long run is that we
we're bringing mostly men but they end
up establishing themselves and then
shipping in
women or they marry Americans and have
kids whatever
so yeah there might be a mismatch of men
to women but that probably will work
itself out too
I don't know I would like to I would
like to at least submit to you that we
can't predict how things will go but I
submit
they're bringing in huge numbers of
young healthy people who like to have
babies
might be better for us than you think
it's hard to predict
and it's all bad in the short run can we
agree on that in the short run it's just
a catastrophe
well I think we all agree on that
short run
bad because it's all coming in the wrong
way it's not controlled it's too much at
once right yeah too much for the
populations to handle that's too much
too far it's too far
uh but I don't think in the long run we
suffer
I think in the long run that's a little
less clear
say and I I do tend to favor the long
run in these situations and I know
that's
kind of outside of your comfort zone
but
let me say a little bit about the
political aspect of it the two strongest
forms of persuasion are
I've taught you many times the two
strongest forms of persuasion are
fear always number one because you have
to solve fear right away oh no I'm
afraid so you got to get out of fear
right away and the other is visual
persuasion
right if you can see it
is more impactful than if you it's just
a concept
so immigration is just a concept until
you bring in thousands at the same time
and then it's a visual
so immigration has two things that Biden
doesn't want
Trump is adding the fear to it and then
the fear is sort of built in because
it's just so many people and and uh yeah
they're moving into the streets Etc so
the fear is just sort of baked in and
then you have the visual on top of that
this is devastating for Biden because
remember the Democrats are not all
solidly in favor of open borders there
are plenty of Democrats who don't like
this at all that don't like it at all
so
this is a topic that's really dangerous
for Biden and is very much going to work
in Trump's favor
at this point the way things are lining
up it's too early to predict a winner
but the way things are lining up it's
almost impossible to believe Trump could
lose
unless the election is rigged
I just don't know how we can lose he's
going against a perfect set of problems
right if you're running for president
you want to be running against a set of
problems and then you want to offer
yourself as a solution who could make a
more credible argument that they would
go hard at immigration than closing the
Border I mean even if he can't get it
done
you did observe that he tried pretty
darn hard and he would at least do what
he did before and that would be make a
big difference
all right so
that is shaping up for to be a very
approach hump situation but very anti
anti-united States situation at the
moment
um
let's say so this would explain why my
orcas
um
which was pointed out to me today if you
look at mallorca's name
it looks like he's the mayor of Chaos
mayor of Chaos
the simulation is trying to tell us
something like I don't I don't think the
simulation could be any more clear with
his winking wank rank
right take a hint
so they're sending 24
000 border patrol people there how in
the world did we have 24 000 border
patrol spare
is there something wrong with that story
there were 24 000 border patrol people
who were not already at the border
which border were they working on
what am I missing here
now the 1500 is something else
but this is directly from the news this
is from the mayor of chaos we have 24
000 border patrol agents at the border
and have surged thousands of troops okay
so maybe the 24 000 are just the full
um and then they added over a thousand
Asylum officers who are basically just
paperwork people
oh so the 24 000 is basically what they
already had
okay so I was reading the story wrong
um
all right
so I think that uh they have to try
pretty hard to control the Border
because this is the election
you know how well uh basic basically
Biden's chances are in the hands of my
orcas right now my orcas will
have a big
impact on whether Biden gets reelected
because if he blows this there's no
going back
if the migrant crisis doesn't get at
least seriously blunted
unless he puts a real big
effort that we don't see coming
he they're just getting rolled and
that's going to be a trump presidency
all right
here is a CNN creating uh more chance
for War uh of course Trump was on CNN as
the town hall and everybody's yapping
about that we'll talk more about that
but that allowed them to unleash Stephen
Collinson their resident uh anti-trump
opinion person
to write some more ridiculous opinion
pieces but here's something that he
pretends not to understand this is
Stefan
um he wrote in on CNN nevertheless
Trump's unwillingness to refer to Putin
as a war criminal meaning in the town
hall he was asked if Putin is a war
criminal and he was not answering that
question uh so Trump's unwillingness to
refer to Putin as a war criminal despite
evidence of Russia's atrocities in
Ukraine and an international criminal
Court warrant for his arrest renewed
Intrigue over the ex-president's motives
in repeatedly genuflecting to the
Kremlin strongman
hmm
so the way CNN is is framing this is
that
Trump being unwilling to call poon a war
criminal
is really because he's uh
under Putin's control
that is TDS stage four that's terminal
Trump derangement syndrome you all know
the real reason right Trump said the
real reason he didn't say that the town
hall but he has before said the real
reason you can't negotiate with somebody
that you labeled the war criminal
how is that not part of the story
you can't negotiate you cannot negotiate
with somebody you would label the war
criminal
it's ridiculous
now are you telling me that Stefan
Collison doesn't know that
that his own Common Sense wouldn't tell
him that you don't call somebody a war
criminal when you try to get them to do
something for you
which is negotiated
or or is he unaware of the news because
I'm not making it up it's what Trump has
said directly
prior you know prior to the town hall
what he was asked goes yeah you don't
you don't call somebody a war criminal
and then negotiate with them you can't
do that if you want to negotiate
successfully
so
how in the world does not this novice
not a story about for the first time a
good negotiator told you how to solve a
war
when and when Trump says he can solve
that war in a day
honestly I think that's possible
because he would be the only one who
would say I will crush both of you
and they would both believe it nobody
else in the world would say it first of
all nobody would say it by him he's the
only one who would say it I will crush
both of you
you're going to make a deal
there's only one person who even has a
plan
to tell me the other plan
to win that's Biden's plan Biden's plan
is to win
are you kidding me
to win
what to win what
exactly
so Trump has the only plan that even on
paper is not bad crazy
I don't know if it'll work
but it's the only one that's not crazy
and he does have the goods he described
to you the exact mechanism with which he
can end the war in the day and you sit
there you go uh
well
uh
why wouldn't that work
why wouldn't that work do you know what
else he's going to say
he's never indicated this but this is
just me speculating this is based
entirely on his talent So based on
Trump's Talent
the day that he started negotiating do
you know what he'd say
do it today
because everybody who gets killed after
today is a waste of people
because you are going to settle it
so do it today
and they'll say hey let's get a meeting
together next week and Trump will say
that's a week of killing people for
nothing
life is short
get your country together now do it
today all right we'll have a phone call
tomorrow now are you listening
to me
today
right now
like make a phone call right now
and stop fighting
or else I will crush both of you I will
I will put I will reduce Russia
to a third world hellhole and Ukraine
you're going to be there with them and
 both of you both of you make
the phone call today
so I think that's what it would look
like behind closed doors
just a guess
but he wouldn't be calling Putin a war
criminal
he would be telling him if you end this
today we could work productively with
you
he would give him a carrot and he would
give him the biggest stick you've ever
seen in your life
because he knows how to negotiate
and he's credible with his threats
and he's credible in the way he says
he's credible which is doesn't
necessarily mean I'll do all those
threats
but you don't know and people really
don't
so
anyway
um
so CNN did something useful by having
Trump on the town hall and presenting
him to everybody and when CNN does
something useful out of their main
customers respond
let's see CNN did something really good
for the country and useful and then
their main customers said
no of course they said that's a great
job CNN well we're so glad that you're
showing us both sides for a change we
really appreciate that you opened it up
and you set your priorities where the
public The public's need to know is the
important thing and it wasn't about the
narrative and it wasn't oh that didn't
happen did it
no pure outrage
pure outrage that their Network could
show both sides of anything
they were actually mad
that the public got to see both sides
now they don't say it that way but
that's exactly what it was
they were mad that the other side got
some time
it's amazing do you think that they're
aware that they can't win on the facts
are on some level or are they aware that
the facts don't work in their favor
right now I'm completely aware that they
say the same thing about the right right
that the the rights not dealing with
facts
but in this particular case
we can talk about them now Dana Perino
had a fascinating comment and I don't
know why I didn't think of it myself so
I I slapped myself when I heard it
which is why is CNN acting like the
Republican primaries already over
that they sort of they sort of presented
Trump like it was a general election
thing they didn't say that
but the complete lack of conversation
about his competitors
like at the very least don't you think
Caitlyn should have said how do you
stack up against your potential
competitors on the Republican side
you know just to put it out there to
remind people that Trump is not the
nominee
so I thought that was a pretty
insightful comment from Dana Perino
because I had completely missed it I I
just sailed right past to assuming he
was the nominee so I had made the same
mistake but they they sort of led me to
that
but it was still my mistake
all right uh
yeah they might think that Trump is is
easier to be so they got a record
record ratings
and but lots of complaints from Their
audience
do you think they should do more stuff
like this and try to get more record
ratings
because they're a business
um
by the way did you did you see the Tweet
by CEO of of CNN Chris light
and his tweet was when he was announcing
that they were going to have Trump
before the event
uh his tweet was are you not entertained
I forget where's that quote come from
are you not entertained is that like a
Roman
some kind of Roman Coliseum thing it's a
gladiator reference right right are you
not entertained
so this is what it tells me it tells me
that Chris light
actually understands what business
season
and he's not hiding it
that part of their job is to make sure
that you come see it
so so putting on a show
is actually completely appropriate
behavior
and I'm I'm all for it because you know
this is the thing I've always
appreciated about Trump
Trump knows that putting on a show
is important
above and you know separate from
politics and policy the show matters so
he puts on the best show you've ever
seen in your life and it helps
but Chris light is clearly aware that
the show matters as long as you're also
getting the facts out right now I
thought the CNN did a great job because
they let Trump go up there and say a
bunch of things that didn't pass the
fact jacking but then they spend plenty
of time fact checking what else they ask
for you you heard Trump's views then the
fact Checkers weighed in
that's exactly what I'm asking for now
I'm not sure the fact Checkers were you
know the the pundits were honest
themselves but at least you got both
sides and so I was pretty happy about
that
but then Anderson Cooper had to come on
and sort of explain and you know
apologize without apologizing and you
know what the heck are they doing with
this monster so here are some of the
things that Anderson Cooper said and let
me preface this by saying I I believe
the two worst news people who are not
yet fired are Anderson Cooper and uh
Jake Tapper
and my complaint with them is that they
don't
they don't uh separate opinion from news
the way uh Fox does well so when you
hear Brett Bear
you don't get it you don't get narrative
yeah you keep expecting it but he just
doesn't do it he gives you the news
on Fox but you're watching Hannity it's
all narrative but you know that and how
did he tells you it's just opinion it's
my opinion right but when you listen to
Anderson Cooper or Jake Tapper I don't
know if they're news or opinion
they they treat their opinion like it's
news
for example in and in so doing they look
like they're begging for therapy when I
hear Anderson Cooper talking about Trump
all I hear is somebody who's having a
severe
psychological reaction and needs therapy
it's like it's like a plea for help
but here's some of the things that
Anderson Cooper said and by the way they
always do the the Trump face
so whatever they talk about they have to
look super disappointed and disgusted
you know even if they were reporting
that Trump got a new necktie they'd be
like
and the ex-president of the United
States
Donald J Trump
got it necktie
another necktie
they'll just make everything sound like
it hurts them physically I've got a pain
in my stomach from something Trump said
um
and honestly it looks like mental
illness
no hyperbole that this is my honest take
when I looked at Anderson Cooper talk
you're talking about why they had Trump
on
it just screams a mental illness
you just screamed it I don't think
that's the look that Chris light wants I
feel like he needs to get rid of the
mentally ill people and I think Jake
tapper's got the same problem he he
presents himself as mental illness
like there's a problem he's having that
he's trying to work through and he's not
doing a good job of it
now
my problem with them is not just that
they don't like Trump or they're you
know left-leading or anything like that
it's that they don't look like news
people
they look like people who need help
and should not be in those jobs they
just don't seem qualified
all right
um
Trump broke both of them I think they
were fine before Trump
so here's what Cooper says
uh to his audience you have every right
to be outraged today
and angry and never watch this network
again
but do you think staying in your Silo
and only listening to people you agree
with is going to make your make that
person go away
and they refer so that was good that was
a good setup but then he referred to
Trump as someone who tried to destroy
our democracy
like that was a fact
where's that fact
are you supposed to be a news news
organization
that's a fact that Trump was trying to
destroy democracy as opposed to the more
obvious explanation that he was trying
to preserve it
now for self-interest of course but the
context was he wanted democracy to work
he didn't want to break it
but to just put that out there and then
his his viewers are going to think
that's some kind of a fact because it's
on the news
um
he went through his uh list of how bad
Trump is and he said he called the black
police officer a thug
the black police officer who shot Ashley
Babbitt
now
who mentioned black
Trump didn't
Trump didn't say that person was black
just said that the person act like a
thug what does a thug act like
well a thug would choose somebody who
you know his opinion didn't deserve to
get a shot that would be Thug Behavior
do you think he only uses the word Thug
when he's talking about black police
officers
I don't know
I've got a feeling that that he he's
reading a little too much into this
Anderson is
and then Anderson said that uh Trump
called Caitlyn Collins nasty which
Anderson said is what he calls any woman
who stands up to him
is that the problem
is it that the women are standing up to
him
I don't think so
I don't think it's the standing up to
him part that's the problem I'm pretty
sure he likes that
I think he likes strong women
so but if they stand up to him and they
say something that's not true or
mischaracterizes something he's going to
go after him so I don't know that's
pretty weak
pretty weak
and then I saw one of the viewers weigh
in somebody named Paul Carr on Twitter
and Paul said some viewers are left
holding a sense of betrayal here
this impacts trust and concern about
editorial judgment I don't know when or
if I'll return to CNN it won't be soon
what do you think Paul does for a living
what do you think his job is take yes
writer is a writer kind of an artist
it's always the writers you know ever
since I started checking profiles when I
see extra dumb opinions
whenever you see extra dumb
they're artists now writers are artists
so they're either actors writers writers
sculptors that sort of thing they're
just the dumbest opinions
what was it there was a there was a
Stephen King tweet
yesterday that I almost retweeted
because I totally agreed with them
what was that I was I tried to remember
what it was because I always like to
point out when I agree with somebody
that I usually disagree with
he made some good point the other day
that I thought oh that's actually a good
point
so
um
anyway
do you think that the viewers are left
holding a sense of betrayal because they
allowed Trump the leader of the uh
polling in the Republican party for
president of the United States
would you feel betrayed if you heard
what he had to say
betrayal doesn't that tell you that they
don't expect the news to give them news
isn't that really clear now like there's
a real strong preference
that the people people know that they
watch the news for the dopamine not the
information
if you watch Fox News
which I like to do
they're going to give you one dopamine
hit after another
because they're going to be agreeing
with their audience all the time so it's
like hey audience you think this we
think you do and then you get that
little dopamine hit
but CNN took away the dopamine hit for
one night so their viewers didn't get a
dopamine hit they got information
useful political information which is
what Trump's up to in his opinions and
they felt betrayed by it
they were betrayed because their
dopamine got taken away oh give me back
my dopamine I'm addicted
well I forget if I talked about this but
the more I think about it the biggest
thing that came out of that town hall
hasn't been discussed at all
you know because you always get into
Trump's Behavior as opposed to his
policies but to me
um
Trump reframing abortion
from a question of life you know when
does it begin because nobody will ever
agree on that
to a question of how you decide
is the most useful thing that's happened
on this debate in my lifetime
if he can pull that off
and I think he can
that is really good for the country
and here's here's what I'm talking about
so he's talked about the Supreme Court
getting the federal government out of
the decision-making so that's what Roe
versus Wade was about overturning that
allowed the federal government to be out
of the loop and now the states get to
decide what is and is not illegal
so Trump says that that's his
accomplishment his accomplishment is
getting the the justices
who would kick it out of the federal
government and drive it down closer to
the individual now he didn't say it that
way but I hope he does which is if you
can't decide the right answer for
something and a life and death question
the best you can do
is Drive the decision as close as you
can to the people who are affected by it
state is closer than the federal
government
and then each state can negotiate
for their best situation but Trump talks
about it as a negotiation
trying to make everybody as happy as
possible
he doesn't talk about it as winning and
preserving life and it's it's binary
there's no flexibility here he
acknowledges he has some exceptions he
prefers no abortion but he allows some
exceptions and he's saying that you
don't have to follow my exceptions
but you have to negotiate and you have
to come up with something that you can
that allow you all to live together
and that's very much the best way for
the president
to to
frame it I don't want the president's
opinion on abortion
I don't mind that I know his personal
opinion
which he tells us I don't mind that but
I don't want him telling the country who
should die
the citizens
yeah who should live and who should die
now outside of
National Defense of course that's his
job but I want a president who just says
every I'm going to try to keep everybody
alive
if you're an American
or even a legal anything or even illegal
I'm going to try to keep everybody alive
that's that's my thing
but I'm also I also understand that
people need to live with each other so
you need to negotiate this in a way
where you're all a little bit unhappy
but you found a way to live together
and
what that does is it takes Trump's
personality and emotion out of the
question and that is the best the best
framing I've seen
you do not want your president's opinion
on this to sway
you you want your president to make sure
that he's created a situation where the
people closest to the actual individuals
the state
can work it out
Kind of Perfect it's perfect in the
sense that you couldn't do better than
that there's no way he could sell his
personal view on abortion he can't sell
it because everybody has their own
personal view of abortion and they're
not going to change but you could
definitely get people to sit down and
not kill each other and come up with a
you know set of laws that are Maybe
individualized by state
um it was a bad law yeah because it was
it was law made in the wrong place
so I agree with the Supreme Court uh on
the limited question of who should be
making the decisions
framing is not a thing unless you're a
propaganda artist well framing is
politics and politics is persuasion and
propaganda Etc
so yeah you're not wrong I wouldn't use
those words but you're not wrong
all right
so I don't think Trump gets enough
credit for that because that's pure
genius and it just gets lost in a cat
named vagina
uh when does a new American citizen gain
its right to life well
nobody's going to agree that would be
the problem
so you negotiate it and you figure out
how to live together
but you don't find the answer that's
your best answer because that's not it's
just not available
for everybody
all right let's talk about that Ukraine
offensive
when Trump entered the conversation and
said on day one when he's in office he's
going to end the fighting
and apparently it's credible enough
that both Ukraine and Russia now have a
now have a deadline
it's like he gave them a deadline and
he's not even in office and it
apparently it's going to work what I
mean by that is that Ukraine is probably
panicking that whatever counter
offensive they're going to do they
better hurry up
because there won't be any more counter
offenses when Trump's in office that's
what it looks like and like and and also
Russia whatever damage they think
they're going to do to Ukraine they
better get going
because you're not going to have two
years to do it you've got one good year
to do whatever you're going to do now it
could be that this will intensify the
fighting like crazy but compress it
because everybody wants to be in the
best situation when you begin the
negotiations so each side is going to
try to win as much as they can
because it's part of the negotiation so
here's what's happened
just think about this
with one town hall
Trump had changed the war from a Forever
War to a one-year War
think about that
it's a one-year War now
you put a timer on it
and and both sides will act like the
timer is ticking and when he gets into
office they will have already decided
that that must be the real deadline they
will talk themselves into the fact that
he's going to end the war
because they're going to act like it for
a year and then when he's in office they
will have already talked themselves into
it oh this is when the war ends oh I get
it like now that's what it ends okay so
between now and then we've got to do
everything we can to support that
deadline you know in in our favor
I don't think you
I haven't heard anybody in the news
talk about the fact that he just ended
the war
he put a deadline on it it's a one-year
War now that all that's going to happen
between now and Trump being in office
they assume
will be that they'll fight as hard as
they can to get a better negotiating
position
the war itself
is over
he ended the war
and nobody's even talking about it he
ended the war
everything that happens now is not the
war
everything from this point on is in
negotiation
it's completely different
so not only did Trump reframe abortion
in the best way anybody's ever done it
nobody's come close
he just ended a war with an interview
come on
come on
you see it right it's just me
you got really quiet because I think
you're you're processing that right now
but he did put a timer on the war nobody
else could do that
literally no one else
if DeSantis said any of the things that
Trump said
people would go ah
just sanctimonious he's probably not
going to be president anyway
but when Trump says it
you totally believe it
right
it's it's the biggest news but because
he talked about a cat named vagina
and he used the word Thug
CNN wants to talk about that while
Anderson Cooper shows us he should be in
therapy
and by the way he does look like he's in
trouble
doesn't he
I mean I'm no
I'm no expert on Mental Health but
Anderson Cooper looks like he's working
through
some problems of his own it doesn't look
like
he's doing his job honestly
all right
well that ladies and gentlemen
was the show you were waiting for
and
it's the best thing you'll see today
wait till tomorrow it's going to be even
better wow so good
and uh YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
appreciate you being here thanks as
always
