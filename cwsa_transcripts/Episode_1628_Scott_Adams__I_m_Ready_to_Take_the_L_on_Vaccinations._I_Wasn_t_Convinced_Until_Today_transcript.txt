um
good morning and welcome to the best
thing that's ever happened to you in
your whole life
and you know there are some things that
can be fixed by the simultaneous Sip and
one of them is
the anticipation of the simultaneous sip
can fix your printer I know you don't
believe that but the people on locals
just saw it live
and if you'd like to fix your printer
too by doing nothing whatsoever but
sipping a beverage all you have to do is
find yourself a copper mug or a glass of
tanker tells a sign of the kinty jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite beverage I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dope would be the other
day it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and this will fix your printer along
with many of your technical personal and
sexual problems it's called the
simultaneous shipment it happens now go
oh yeah
well Rasmussen did a poll to find out
how people were thinking of Biden's
first year in the office
how do you think that went
did the public say whoa
that Biden's nailing it got to get a lot
more of him was it something like that
or did 50 say he was very unsuccessful
10 percent say he's somewhat
unsuccessful
for a full
60
believing it was not a successful year
that's not good
that's not good at all
um uh more than that 57 percent said
we're more divided than before
well given that he's the great bringer
together
and he ended up being the great divider
I would say that is a uh an ambiguous
failure
unambiguous failure
but let me give you some uh political
advice
never promised to bring the country
together
because you gotta that's sort of a
losing
uh battle don't don't promise that
you'll beat a pandemic and bring the
country together
nope there are two things you're not
going to do
so I guess Biden learned that
here's a political slash virus question
for you Ian martisis asks this question
can we calculate I'm sort of
paraphrasing his question but uh could
we calculate
how many people died
because the vaccination rollout was
delayed
from the time that we had all the data
we were going to use for the decision
it looks like until maybe after the
election or for some other political
reason
do you think that we would be able to
determine
how many people died
because we waited on the vaccines
some would say for political reasons
some would say maybe not
in a totally lubarsky points out
he says we did not know the
effectiveness nor the safety rates
before November and that took a while to
scale up
um and Ian replied to that saying that
there was no his understanding is that
there was no new data that was presented
after the delay
and I asked the same questions
how hard do you have to look at the data
to know if it says up or down
I feel like
I feel like the data if it is packaged
in a way that is meant to be read
would tell you if it works right away
wouldn't it say here's the data
on this tab you can see that the the bad
side effects were this
but you can see that the effectiveness
was this
or or do or do they just give you raw
data
and then every single person who looks
at it has to like come to their own
conclusions is that how it works
I would think that the data says summary
we have this many uh side effects we
have this many benefits
am I wrong about that that would be a
pretty basic assumption so why would it
take more than
10 minutes for somebody who's not going
to do a deep dive themselves why would
it take somebody more than 10 minutes to
say yes
now of course you'd want somebody who
was really good at looking at data to
jump in and ask a bunch of questions but
that's even that's that's adding a week
am I right because it's a crisis it's an
emergency you get the best people on the
job you'd fly them in you'd spare no
expense why would it take more than a
week
for the best data you know spelunker in
the world to dig in and just see if
there's anything fishy in the data so I
don't know what the reason would be
for the delay if it were not political
how many of you think that there was a
political delay unrelated to anything
functional or
any real obstacles
yeah there are a lot of people who
suspect that but I think it's I think I
think it's something short of definite
um
so I think I think somebody's going to
end up calculating that of course
they'll be highly highly controversial
now did you hear the rayapps is going to
testify to the January 6 committee
so the famous rayaps the guy that many
think is a Fed
and so here's the mystery of let's see
why did
was it Kipping kippinger or whatever
said clippinger was his name
said that uh
Ray UPS had already talked to the
committee
but apparently it was a preliminary talk
and he's going to go I think on on
record and under oath kinzinger yes so I
think kinzinger had said that he had
already
talked
but he hadn't talked in detail and maybe
under oath I don't know maybe that's the
difference too so he will be coming back
now
what do you did you do you remember one
of the suspicions was that he was no
longer on the list of most Wanted like
there was a list of FBI's most wanted
from that night and originally he was on
there but fairly soon after he was put
on the list he dropped off and did you
say to yourself well that's suspicious
that's suspicious
do you know why he dropped off the list
of most wanted
he turned himself in right away
he wasn't Most Wanted so the only reason
he dropped off the list of most wanted
is because he called up and said hey
this is Ray Epps here's my address
here's my name here's my phone number
when do you want me to come in or
something like that
so as soon as somebody is no longer Most
Wanted because they've literally
surrendered
you take them off the list
how many of you thought it meant
something
that he was taken off the list
how many of you said that's that means
something
instead of the most obvious reason you
would be taken off a list
is that you don't belong on the list
now I have to admit I didn't see that
it's the most obvious thing in the world
and I was actually blinded to it
probably many of you were too I was
blinded to the most obvious reason and
let me tell you how stupid I am all
right full confession
I've seen video
of the press
talking to rayaps like after the event
the Press knows exactly where he lives
the press found him he's not I should
have known as all of you should have
known that he definitely wasn't Most
Wanted
meaning they knew exactly where he was
he may or may not have some involvement
that you know you want to know about
that's a separate question but in terms
of being Most Wanted nope
he was right there available for anybody
who wanted him right that is you know
easily available
so that explained that part now I do
think it will be really interesting to
see him answer questions under oath
and I hope that the uh the Ted cruises
Etc that the people who are good at
asking questions
can really really
stop
so there's a whole new kind of a troll
that just appeared in the political
season
and I would love to now let me just
change the topic for a moment I would
love to know what kind of training or
Theory they're working under does the
new brand of trolls all have the same
quality they don't have any complaint
they just say things like stop stop
just don't do it anymore and I'll be
like what stop what
I'm not even sure what the topic is
and then the LOL trolls LOL Scott LOL
you're coping
L and so I thought to myself
I should take these people seriously
there are so many people telling me that
I'm experiencing cognitive dissonance
and my first impression was well that's
obviously projection
you're the one who's who's experienced
that you're projecting on me but you
know what the problem with projection is
you never know who's doing it
am I projecting on my critics
or are my critics projecting on me
and how would I know
well
I decided to go with
the crowd
and the crowd has decided that the
problem is on my end and so I've decided
to take the L
and admit
that I'm afraid and coping and I'll
explain all that as we go
so if you wanted to hear me say you know
it looks like
I really just made my decision and a
fear
and at this point I'm doing nothing but
coping and flailing around trying to
justify it it's kind of embarrassing
I know some of you would be embarrassed
even to be associated with me because of
my behavior
but
um we'll get into the details of why it
is that I'm accepting the L
uh a great shame and embarrassment which
will be a stain on my reputation forever
and we'll get into that in a moment it
turns out that the argument is really
strong and I hadn't seen it before so
we'll get to that
uh all right uh can you believe I hope
you can that uh Boris Johnson announced
that the UK is dropping face masks and
any remote work requirements there may
be some other mandates are getting rid
of I'm not sure
um and I ask you this
is the science on the other side of the
Atlantic from where I am different
the over in Great Britain do they do
science different
or should we be doing the same thing
right away
because I don't know if China is looking
at the same science as the United States
maybe they have extra stuff I don't know
but I am fairly sure of the Great
Britain
the UK is looking at the same
information as the United States
same science same Concepts probably same
data
why do they have a different decision
it's not I don't think it's because
their curves are different right or
their vaccination rate
I mean not that different that that's
the reason they would make a different
decision
I think that the February one date is
actually maybe waiting too long I I've
asked directly for uh
my Governor Newsom and President Biden
to get ahead of the February one date
and because February 1 is the date that
the public is just going to say it
and take the masses off and you want
your government to get ahead of that to
remain credible
because I want my government to be
credible I feel like that's better right
so I'm telling the government that the
parade has started
and and there's plenty of room in the
front
if they'd like to start now and get in
front of the parade I accept them as my
leaders please please take this out of
the hands of the public
but if you're not going to do your job
let's be clear
politicians of the United States
if you're not going to do your job which
is to lead us out of the pandemic make
the obvious decisions of valuing Freedom
the way the public does
get the out of the way
those are your only two choices left
am I right the public will take over
there's no way it's going to be stopped
the public in the United States and
other places is different but in the
United States the public will determine
when the masses are over
February 1's looking like that date
and government please lead us please get
in front of the parade while there's
still time if you don't
it's not going to make much of a
difference
but get out of the way right
because you're not going to stop it once
we decide to take the mass off
I've decided that analogy is surrender
when it comes to a debate here's why
there are two ways to use an analogy one
is to explain the New Concept that's a
good way to use it I like to use my
example if you're trying to explain a
zebra to someone who didn't know had
never seen a zebra you might say well
you know imagine a horse
and the horse had stripes it look a lot
like that and you say oh yeah your your
horse analogy really helped me
understand a zebra but that wasn't an
argument right nobody was arguing about
zebras somebody was just explaining the
concept
but in the in the context of an argument
if I say something about the uh
the coveted vaccination
I will often guess somebody say well
you're wrong
because something something with polio
vaccinations
to which I say
if we were talking about Polio I would
agree with you that's just a whole
different situation
that was not an analogy
to show me A New Concept it was actually
an argument if somebody argues with an
analogy they've completely abandoned the
argument and they've moved it to some
new hypothetical imaginary argument
so if you can discern the difference
between somebody using an analogy as an
argument which is bad crazy
versus using it just to make a point
about how the world works
you can really decide whether you want
to spend any more time with somebody who
left the argument
so when people Retreat to an analogy I
just say
I accept your defeat
I accept your defeat and somebody says
wrong again it's the same situation no
polio is not the same situation
this is up this is different a situation
as I can think of
for one thing the vaccinations
work to stop the
the polio spread I mean there's a pretty
big difference
so um
anyway
um and I always one of my favorite uh
thought experiments is imagining if
Einstein had been alive at the same time
as Twitter
can you imagine Einstein just being like
somebody who tweets
and you know one day Einstein's fussing
around and he figures out that E equals
m c squared
and he's thinking all right you know I'm
going to publish this
but before I do
I'm going to tweet it I can say I have a
preprint
I got this idea here's my math take a
look at it what would Twitter do
as a response to Albert Einstein
tweeting that E equals m c squared and
then perhaps showing his work
and say all right here's my calculations
I've submitted this to peer review
but I wanted to tell you here on Twitter
first
well I believe he would get the
following comments
LOL
LOL
nothing else just LOL
I believe somebody would say uh uh
Albert you're embarrassing yourself
you're embarrassing yourself now Albert
just stop
please
please just stop
he would get that
uh but he would also get take the L
uh Albert
um I feel like you're just coping
with the fact that gravity is a is real
and and Newton had all the answers
I just take the L
take the L
now does anybody doubt
that his comments thread his comments
would look like that so seriously
in all seriousness if he had said if he
had done that tweeted E equals MC
squared before you knew it was true
wouldn't he get all of those comments
and here's here's my question about the
trolls
the the there's a great influx of paid
trolls and a huge number of them come
after me every day are they trying to
wear me out
are they trying to ruin my reputation so
people don't listen to me on other
topics I suppose
are they trying to
just I don't know divert my energy
are they trying to uh trick me into
overreacting so that I you know destroy
myself
do they so the question is do they
explicitly have a theory like a
psychiatric theory about how they're how
the thing works because I actually think
it does work
my you know being on the uh on the
victim side of it if you will
I would say that they do siphon off my
energy
and there are lots of people I enjoy
um
going back and forth with on Twitter but
usually it's the people who have
something like a a good a good argument
and that increases my energy and I enjoy
it but but the LOL trolls who just say
take the L and you're coping I feel as
though they're just there to drain
energy
or to get you worked up so you embarrass
yourself
does anybody have a better theory for
that because it's quite clear that
they're they're paid
or organized they might not be paid but
they're at least organized
all right
um so
Israel has some news and have I ever
told you that we can't tell the
difference between good news and bad
news so this tweet was I believe tweeted
in the context of it being bad news
but I looked at and I said
um this looks like exactly good news not
just good news great news not just great
news but some of the best news I've ever
seen
here's the news
that Israel which is the only this is Dr
Eli David put it this way I don't know
this isn't you know technically true but
he says the only quadruple of ax country
it's not technically true because
they're not all quadruple facts but lots
of more I guess the only quadruple of
ex-country in the world uh also using
mask mandates and coveted passports just
broke the global record for daily covet
cases so on a
per capita basis
um
so is that bad news or good news anybody
is it good news or bad news that the
most vaccinated country by far
has the highest rate of infection
good news or bad news
I would trade places with them in a
heartbeat
I would totally trade places with him
except for the booster part the booster
part I'm not a fan of but if you could
give me two vaccinations and the highest
rate of current infections that's the
one I want
you know assuming our Health Care system
is still stable that's a big if but
assuming it's stable and I think it is
in Israel that's your best case because
95 of the new infections are Omicron we
know that Omicron slices through the
vaccinations like they don't exist
right
so the very best situation is that you
have a regular vaccination and then
later you get the Omicron
according to the only information I've
seen that's the very best protection
with with basically really low risk
because it's Omicron so what could be
better than massive new Omicron
infections in a country that's the most
vaccinated
that's literally the best case scenario
according to science
now if the science is wrong then yeah of
course they'll drop dead from the
vaccinations
so or even if you know I won't even say
if science is wrong because science
doesn't know the future
right so science doesn't have an opinion
on 10 years from now so if 10 years from
now everybody who got a vaccination dies
from a blood clot then science will be
wrong but at the moment
at the moment science agrees with Israel
that they are in the very best situation
so it's interesting that Dr Eli David I
think now I don't want to be a mind
reader but I believe the context of it
as I read it is that that's bad news for
Israel when in fact it's the best news
all right
um
I did I did some highly biased
unscientific polls on
Twitter and this was to confirm
that that I'm coping and taking the L
so some of this now remember these are
not scientific but it is only a these
are only my followers for the most part
on Twitter
so I asked this question uh do
vaccinations increase or decrease risk
not just at risk
right so that means you're looking at
all risk the risk of the vaccination
itself the risk of covid all the risks
so do vaccinations increase or decrease
risk
of the people who answered my Twitter
poll 56 says it decreases
interesting but uh
23 percent or twenty four percent ish
said the vaccination doesn't do anything
it neither increases nor decreases your
risk
and 22 percent said it's more risk
so there's more risk in taking the
vaccination than not now of course you
you know if you want to be
more technical you would divide it by
comorbidities and age and risk profiles
and all that stuff but if you were
looking at just the the total average
56 says it decreases risk but
if you put together the people who say
the Vex does nothing which would be a
bad idea to take it right
I think you'd all agree that if you knew
the vaccination was not helping you
would definitely not take it
because there might be some risk of the
vaccination itself so if you put
together the people who say it does
nothing and the people who say it
increases risk you're up to around 46
percent
who say the vaccinations make things
worse
okay well 46 no that's not science
that's just your opinion but 46 I have
to take seriously right
would you agree would you agree that if
46 of a poll in America have a different
opinion than you
at the very least
you should take that seriously
do I agree would everybody agree with
that
I'm not saying agree with it or disagree
with it but you should take it deadly
serious because it's a life and death
question
on a life and death question which this
literally is
life and death if 46 are on the other
side for me
I'm going to take that really seriously
so we're getting closer to all I'll
reveal to you why I I'm going to take
the L and admit you're all right at
least the 46 percent of you
um and this is
this is really what uh pushed me over
the edge
I said
because a lot of people were saying
pointing out that the vaccinated people
in hospitals in some cases were uh
having more bad outcomes than the
unvaccinated
and I thought to myself huh I've seen
exactly the opposite data but if so many
people have seen data that's the
opposite of the data I've seen the data
I've seen was that you're eight times
more likely to have a good outcome if
you're vaccinated
in other words you're eight times more
likely to die if you get hospitalized if
you're unvaccinated that was that was
the bad data apparently I was looking at
but
um
I realized I was doing the math wrong
so
this is going to be my biggest
confession
and I did a little poll here and
and that straightened me out and I can't
real I can't believe how dumb I was
remember I've told you that I I rarely
get embarrassed
this is embarrassing
you know I found my limit for
embarrassment I am very embarrassed so I
did a poll and
I just asked how many people agreed with
this I said we're lucky we don't have a
hundred percent vaccination rates
because imagine if everybody were
vaccinated because in that case
a hundred percent of the future deaths
from covid would be among the vaccinated
and I thought of that was like oh
that's true the only reason we don't
have already a hundred percent deaths
among the vaccinated only
the only thing preventing that
is that we don't have enough
vaccinations and here I was thinking oh
you know wouldn't it be good to have
more vaccinations I mean I wasn't
promoting it but in my mind I was doing
the math and I was thinking
wait if the vaccinations help which I I
now I realize I can't trust that data
but if the vaccinations help
I would want everybody to be vaccinated
for their own benefit for their own
benefit not even for mine but
when I looked at the logic of it I can't
really Escape it if we if we were 100
vaccinated every single person in the
hospital who died of anything
if they died of covid if they died of
um a car accident
every one of them would be vaccinated
and that would be proof that
vaccinations don't work
now if you say to yourself Scott I'm not
sure if you're doing the math right oh I
am because when I I did the Tweet 53
percent of my followers agreed with my
math
that if everybody were vaccinated
then all the deaths would be among the
vaccinated and that would be proof that
the vaccinations don't work
and I've got to say that that convinced
me
that put me over the edge
so I'm going to take the L
based on based on this solid logic here
but I'll go on
there's also what I'll call the the Tim
pool uh
type of thinking that my first reaction
to it was I feel like you're leaving
something out
I get your point but it feels like
something important is being left out
but now I'm convinced that nothing
important was left out and so I did
another poll
um and I said
let's see what was the exact one
so yeah I asked if people if
if the only benefits of vaccinations
let's say you knew that vaccinations did
not stop the spread which we do know
right we all know that vaccinations
don't stop the spread and
were we not promised that it would
give me a fact check were we not
promised very clearly
by the authorities the the experts were
we not told that this would
stop a spread
now
um I remember the numbers were like it
would stop like 90 percent of the spread
now the other thing I didn't realize at
the time is that 90 and 100 of the same
number
I I thought there was like a little
difference so when I read it and this is
how I misinterpret it when they said
uh it'll stop the spread 90 to 95
percent of time somewhere in that range
I thought to myself that oh well that
would leave
some like five percent or so
that the vaccination wouldn't stop the
spread
but apparently and I've been informed
that 95 and 100 of the same number
I thought they were like different
numbers and stuff but they're the same
number so originally we can all agree
that they said they would stop the
spread completely
and that uh but what happened instead
especially with abercromb is apparently
the vaccinations have almost no effect
would you agree
so what we were promised
100
vaccination Effectiveness like polio
but instead what we got was something
that didn't stop the spread at all
same page so far everybody we're all the
same page they promised us to stop the
spread it didn't do it at all with
Omicron anyway
so that's bad now therefore
they promised us it would do those
things it does not therefore uh
vaccination is pointless
pointless now when the first time I
heard that point of view I was like wait
a minute
are you leaving out like the main thing
like isn't the main point to stay alive
and doesn't the data that the so-called
experts are saying doesn't it say that
there's a eight eight to one advantage
to being vaccinated
and doesn't don't they say it also
prevents you from being seriously
hospitalized and uh some new data that
you know needs to be confirmed I don't
think it's solid but that it might even
reduce your long-haul symptoms so I
thought to myself
isn't the the Tim pool thought that
vaccinations are pointless
I get the point about it not stopping
the spread that makes complete sense
that part would be pointless
but wasn't there another point of like
staying alive and stuff like survival
and things like that but I am now uh
decided that I'm just projecting or
coping
that my view in this was probably based
on my fear of having made the wrong
vaccination decision
and not of any kind of logic or anything
like that
so my current logic and I asked other
people if they agreed with the Tim pool
logic and 45 percent did they said there
would be no point in taking a
vaccination that doesn't stop the spread
if all it does is keep you alive and
prevent you from having bad symptoms
so
um
45 I'm going to take seriously
and so I I think I was overvaluing the
whole Staying Alive part
I was like so this was my error in the
long run my error was
I I was undervaluing the argument about
the spread
and I was putting too much weight
on survival
so I think I'm gonna I'm just gonna
accept
I'm going to accept my defeat and uh let
this be a lesson for a lot of you
if you can learn how to uh how to lose
gracefully
allow me to be your role model
I accept total complete defeat
I don't think that I can defend
my batshit crazy idea that survival
should be like a high priority and that
that would be in the conversation
I think survival is not important
nor do I think suffering should be part
of the equation at all
in fact I think six months of horrible
suffering from long-haul symptoms you
should just take right out of the right
out of the decision
because the the data isn't solid anyway
so I am now persuaded
that I should ignore the risk of death
uh and long long horrible horrible
symptoms and instead just look at this
one promise they made that I think I
think they lied about
they lied about that promise so if that
promise was a lie then you can't believe
anything
and therefore it would be pointless
to get a jab wait a minute pointless
pointless
do you realize that needles have a point
that's all I'm saying
um
and so I asked people what do you
conclude this is another poll what do
you conclude when hearing that lots of
vaccinated people were hospitalized with
coffee
and I gave them choices I said do you
conclude that the vax doesn't protect
you
or do you conclude that's how math works
or other and here are the answers at
least preliminarily may have changed a
little bit
so uh 47 say that the conclusion would
be that
the vaccination doesn't help
and 34 said that's how math Works nerds
can we take a moment
just to mock these idiots
uh there are all these nerds coming into
the pole
nerds
 nerds and they're and they're
trying to win this argument with math
can you believe that
they're using math
math
I don't know
I I don't know what to say about people
who think that math tells you anything
um I would go with people who are pretty
sure that they can read my mind
because you want to be if you're going
to approach something like this you want
to approach it with a rational approach
now what would be more rational
math
math
duh or
um reading the minds of a stranger to
determine how much fear they have in
their hidden thoughts a fear that would
be associated with them believing they
made the right choice on everything but
if fear not nonetheless
and I don't think it's no contest
math I think has been largely debunked
am I right
um I'm pretty sure I've seen math being
debunked on Twitter there was no source
for it and I didn't look into it do
deeply but I did do my own research I
did my own research which involved
seeing a
seeing a meme on Twitter and that said
the math is and so that's good
enough for me
um
but the idea that somebody could read my
mind and see my secret hidden thoughts
about my fear and then put that together
and decide that I'm operating on a fear
and not math
I think that's a little more credible
and something you should Bank on
so if you have a choice of depending on
math and nerds am I right
 nerds like who's going to side
with them
don't don't instead go with the Mind
readers because those are the rational
people
all right
so if I may uh if you'd all like to dunk
on me
I I accept my shame
and I'm here for you I had be I was of
the opinion
that all of the science supports my
lucky guess on vaccinations the lucky
guess was
that I'd wait as long as possible to get
vaccinated in the first place to see if
anything was fishy
then if I had to make the decision and
then I did because I had to fly that I
would
but then I would also wait as long as
possible for the boosters to see if the
boosters were sketchy
and sure enough waiting to get the
booster was exactly the right decision
because we learned that the Omicron is
going to just fly through the booster
and you'd probably be just as happy with
Omicron as with the vaccination frankly
so
did I smartly
make all the right decisions not really
because I don't know the risk of the
vaccination itself
nobody does and I don't know the
long-term risk to me personally
of covet so I was guessing I said that
from the start I was just guessing
but
those of you who are not guessing
and not making the mistake I made which
is after guessing to look at the math
and see if you can determine anything
because math
instead using the mind reading technique
for knowledge
I think you guys got it right this time
so on paper it would look like my
guesses and my process for getting to
where I am on paper if you believe the
experts was perfect
compared to all the other choices but by
luck
remember I'm telling you that if you
think I'm telling you I use my
smartitude to make the right decision
nothing like that happened I was
guessing just like you were but based on
current information by the experts all
of this is subject to change of course
could be changed tomorrow but at the
moment
I hit my complete luck the exact right
place to be according to current data
two vaccinations of moderna
followed by no boosters
followed by almost certainly getting
Omicron fairly soon
now I'm not saying that that is the
right decision are you hearing me
clearly how would I know because I don't
know what future risks are I don't know
if I die from a clock tomorrow morning
right so I can't know I made the right
decision that's not that's not knowable
but nobody else can either
so
but am I comfortable with my decision
of course I am I mean I'm comfortable
in Only The Limited sense that it
coincidentally agreed with science at
this moment it doesn't mean that the
science is right I mean that could
change
but yeah at the moment I got lucky so
tomorrow if it turns out that the only
people who survived got the boosters
then I'd say oh I guess I got it wrong
but at the moment everything is on my
side
I believe it'll change but at the moment
um
let's see what'd you say
I saw an interesting comment here I want
to get back
uh is he purposely destroying his
reputation
you're asking about me am I purposely
destroying my reputation that's actually
a good question how many think that
how many of you are wondering if I'm
personally destroying my reputation like
intentionally am I intentionally
destroying my reputation
uh yeah I'm agreeing with you if you
said I got lucky
all right well I guess it depends who
you're looking at so what reputation do
you think I want
I don't want the reputation of agreeing
with a team
so so to me the greatest insult
would be always agreeing with a side
to me that would be shameful
I
I don't think I would ever say my
opinions in public
but the only reputation I want
is that I didn't agree with teams didn't
agree with all the left and agree with
all the right that's that's all I want
I I don't really need right or wrong
because nobody will ever agree on that
but I do need to not be Associated only
with one side that's all I ask
so reputationally that's all I ask
uh on the cold survey he did oh I I
think it ended up I did a survey of if
people normally got colds just regular
colds
would they be more likely to get covered
now of course it was Twitter polls so
there's no science here but
interestingly it ended up being kind of
similar
the people who often got colds
got a got covered
as likely as people who didn't get colds
so covid does not seem to if you were to
believe a Twitter poll which you
shouldn't but if it were correct it
would indicate that your prior immunity
wasn't that important but wouldn't you
like to see a real an actual scientific
study you know you can't believe the
Twitter poll of course but a scientific
study would be really interesting I'd
love to know how much prior exposure
makes a difference
7 45 today I don't have a hard stop but
thank you Paul for I like I like that
you do that every weekday but today I I
don't have to drive
Christina's driving today
Boris is dropping mandates as he is
facing leadership challenge because he
has parties at 10 down he needs to lift
his popularity with voters uh good
comment that Boris Johnson is responding
to the public
who did I tell you runs the country
now I wasn't talking about you know
Boris Johnson's situation but if Boris
Johnson is getting ahead of the parade
it's because the parade started
it's not it's not because it's probably
not because of some other reasons I
don't think it's because of science
yeah uh so yes that's what we want in
this country we want we want our leaders
to go Boris Johnson's way and say oh
shoot I better get in front of this
thing because it's the Train's already
moving right
yeah February 1 is approaching it almost
it almost seems too far away now because
when you see the UK
make this decision today their science
can't be that different
the February one is way too long now now
that somebody made the first move there
should be a first mover
kind of effect
Scott fears death
in all capitals let me tell you
something how many of you fear death
I'm kind of curious about this how many
of you feared death
all right they're saying some yeses and
no's I I had a realization recently
that I've never felt a fear of death
like ever
I've definitely feared injury
I have a I have a substantial fear
of injury
but I've never I've never once honestly
my life isn't that good
that I that I needed an unlimited amount
of it
you know and especially now
I'm at a really uh unique place in my
life where I've done what I needed
like if I stop now
like if I just died tomorrow
uh on my last thought would be all right
I got it done
I did what I needed to do you know I
left I left things a little better
so I am so ready to be dead
I mean I hate to say it as starkly as
that but quite honestly
I'm ready I mean I had a good run I'm
completely ready so
I can promise you
that of all of my fears
death might be I don't even know if it's
on the list
because my concept of death is that
that's when you don't have any pain in
any problems
and I'm not even sure I don't look
forward to it in a way you know because
life is life is you know good
but it's not great
if I may say so you know life being
alive has advantages
you know and I'm sure that I would be
happy that I had them but when I'm dead
none of it's going to matter
to me I mean it will matter to who's
left behind but won't matter to me so I
don't even really understand the concept
of being afraid of death like I don't
have I don't have any hook
that my mind can connect to to say oh
that makes sense to be afraid of death
my life has never been so good that I
preferred it over death
I'll be honest with you that for most of
my childhood I I plan to end my life
um you know when I turned 18.
so literally so most of my childhood was
waiting to kill myself because I didn't
think my quality of life was sufficient
to make it worth the effort I would say
that my entire twenties
were well below the level
of being worth being alive
you know if I had to look at it in
retrospect
I would say the first
30 the first half of my life was below
below the level of being worth it
uh you know there are Great Moments
there right there are great times within
that time but I'd say the first half
definitely not worth it then I'd say
maybe the next 20 years
while there were like tremendous
successes and monetary advantage and you
know great relationships and bad
relationships and everything else I
would say there are definitely some high
points but I'd say the next 20 years
break even
uh you know I I don't if you ask me
would you want to do it over again or
would you just rather be dead I'd say I
don't know it's coin flip and I I give
me dead I don't know what it wasn't
really worth it
but if you fast forward to the moment
um at the moment yeah they're they're
really high highs and they're really low
lows
at the moment
let's see if I were to assess whether
it's worth being alive to me personally
like right now
hmm
yeah I don't know I don't know
close call
close call so anybody who thinks that uh
anybody who thinks that
uh like I'm worried about death you
really couldn't be further from the
truth
if you said I were I was worried about
injury you'd be right on
Scott is begging for help no I'm giving
you a cold assessment of life
I'll bet it's not that different from
yours actually let's test that how about
less about me and more about you
more about you
how many of you right now think that
being alive is a better deal than not
being alive right now
your current life
is it better to be alive
I'm saying uh
lots of yeses but uh some 50 50s I'm
seeing some no's
uh
now I do think that the way life works
is if you are alive you talk yourself
into a big good idea
um
how would I know yeah how would you know
oh if you ever had children it makes you
want to be alive but yeah no I what do
you say wanting to be alive there are
reasons for the benefit of other people
I would say I mostly stay alive for the
benefit of other people I would say at
this point I'm not really in it for my
own pleasure because that's sort of
fleeting
I'm not I'm not that much of a pleasure
Seeker yeah if I were I would have
retired a long time ago if I were a
pleasure Seeker I wouldn't be doing this
I mean I do enjoy this but I'm just
saying that I would just go sit on the
beach somewhere and not work
because I have the option
yeah I would say that my uh my reason
for staying around being alive is
whatever I can do for other people and
pretty much that's the whole that's the
whole deal right now I'm a little bit
curious
Because curia by the way one of the best
motivators
I found you want a new here's a little
uh reframe for you
I find that Curiosity
can solve a lot of problems
meaning just focusing on your curiosity
instead of focusing on your problem
so here's the reframe this is one of the
best ones I've ever used I don't know if
it'll work for others maybe maybe
there's something personalized about
this but now and then I'll be saying to
myself
I just don't I did ever have those days
where you're just going to wake up and
today's like yesterday
and you think to yourself this isn't
even worth it
you just wake up and you're like am I
just gonna put on my socks and
you know have my breakfast and go to
work and come back and is it just going
to be like yesterday
and also if you have a big problem
you're like oh God this big problem I
don't know what's going to happen with
it could go buy a bag and here's the
reframe
turn it into curiosity
instead of
I don't know pain and unwee and all
those other bad feelings because if you
watch it like a movie or a book you say
to yourself I wonder how this is going
to turn out
now I you would be surprised that this
works right when you first hear it wait
a minute I'm not just gonna change my
frame to curiosity about how it works
but it does work for me
so I'm not sure it would work for others
it might be just something about my how
I'm wired but it reliably works I just
say you know I'll just watch this like a
movie and see how it turns out
and just and here's the thing curiosity
is really baked into you as a an
essential element of Who You Are
would you agree with that that without
curiosity
humans would just fall apart
civilization would fall apart so
curiosity isn't just a thought
it's baked into who you are it's one of
your most basic things so the point is
to get away from your intellectual
the intellectual part of you which is
saying how will this turn out it's
making me stressed could go this way it
could go that way I want it to go this
way but I've got an obstacle I'm trying
this but it won't work so that's the
intellectual way to frame it
are you are you naturally intellectual
a little bit
but not the way you're naturally curious
you see what I mean your curiosity is
really baked in that's like a that's a
basic biological function but your
higher intellectual thoughts of how
things will work out
that's that's a little bit more of a
modern
I don't know emerging property or
something I'm using all the wrong
sciency words but the idea is that
curiosity is just stronger and more
basic than your intellectual thoughts
about what might go wrong
so just move your move your focus
not entirely because you can never leave
the intellectual but move your focus to
oh I just wonder how this is going to
turn out
I'm just super curious if this is going
to be a disaster tomorrow
it works
I swear it works
all right
so
um
I do think that we are beyond the The
Mask vaccination questions would you
agree
are we beyond them the question of
whether you should or should not do
anything mandated
I were beyond that so I'm not going to
talk you into anything
that would be stupid at this point and
also immoral you know I said from the
beginning that trying to persuade you to
get a vaccination would be deeply
immoral
for those on YouTube
especially can the rest of you confirm
that that from the beginning the very
first words that in my mouth were that
trying to persuade you in one one way or
the other would be deeply immoral in my
case especially
in my case especially
because I'm trained to persuade
like a like a prize fighter now that's
an old term I guess a professional boxer
you know can't get into a street fight
because that would be considered unfair
in the same way if you're making a life
and death medical decision and I'm not
your doctor you do not want me trying to
persuade you you do not want that
because I'm trained I'd be too good at
it and then I would take it in a way it
would it would reduce your agency you
know your own ability to control
yourself
and so for everyone who thinks I have
been secretly trying to support the
vaccinations I don't say things that
directly if I don't mean them
right if there's one thing you can know
about me for sure
if I say something clearly and directly
and without being prompted and I say it
over and over again it's true
right you'll never find an exception to
that if nobody asked me to say it I say
it clearly and directly and over and
over again it's true
and you can take that to the bank
you know if I'm if I'm vague about
something then you know maybe I've got
some
some hidden agenda or something but if
I'm direct and consistent
you can back on that that that's really
really what I think
um
Biden said something about facts and
Truth recently
uh why are the trolls hard to persuade
because they're not there to be
persuaded do you know how many of my
trolls actually have troll in their bio
a lot
I would say something like I don't know
30 of all my critics actually have in
their bio
Twitter troll
look for yourself yeah they're not there
to be convinced
all right
Good Times
all right that's all I got for now
um and I will uh
back off from some of this vaccination
and mass talk for now I'm going to hit
really really hard the the dropping the
mask mandate by uh February 1. how many
how many of you are on board with that
February 1 as our public deadline to our
government
as to when the public is done with the
mandates
yeah so
if you're on board tweet it and I've I
added the following twist that I think
helps I've asked small businesses well
businesses I've asked businesses to put
a hashtag Feb one sign on their window
or door
because if I see that sign I'm going to
go right in
so it's free marketing
it just put up the sign you don't need
an explanation it doesn't have to you
don't have to be a rebel or anything
else just hashtag Feb one put a little
sign on your door
I will buy your even if I don't
want it
I will walk directly into your store
take out my wallet and buy some of your
just because you have the hashtag on now
that's free marketing
how many of you would join me you don't
have to buy things you don't want but
how many of you would join me in in
showing a strong preference
for somebody who had a hashtag Feb one
sign in their building
yeah look at the comments yeah strong
preference we don't love boycotting I
I'm big on not boycotting like there's
some exceptions when they're beyond the
line but I'm really big
on marketing
right marketing works so why not get
some free marketing we're offering it to
you if you just put this put a hashtag
in your window get some extra business
your neighbor won't get that's it
so I don't know how big this can get but
it needs to get big enough to make your
Governors and your president say to
themselves oh shoot the Parade's already
moving we better get in front of it
and there's no fight to be had here
I don't want to fight with the
government I want to assist it and
that's very very important the framing
here should be assisting our government
because they legitimately are the wrong
tool for getting us out of a pandemic
because they have too much risk aversion
we don't have the same risk aversion
we're the public so the public needs to
guide them help them
push them but it's not a fight it's not
a fight we're not on the other side from
the government don't don't get that
wrong you are here to help
you're here to help
push your government in the right
direction they need it they want to be
pushed there's nothing that would make
Biden happier than 75 percent of the
public saying let's get rid of mandates
because that's that's good for him too
he wants he wants that done before
the midterms right
so everybody wants this to happen
this this is activating the fake because
the The public's active activity is
creating the fake because it's a real
one I guess but but it operates as the
the reason
that uh the Biden and the governors can
say okay
now now that the uh now that Boris
Johnson has made that move
don't you think every Governor is
talking about it
I don't know how you can see that uh
that the science is different on the
other side of the Atlantic and not at
least ask yourself is it time over here
because situation is the same so I feel
as though if you get one more entity
to go maskless it could be one big state
you know Blue State that'd be impressive
um or one other country maybe another
European country to follow the lead
one more and two points to draw a line
and then it's over
so that's how close we are to being done
with this at least the basketball we're
that close one more entity boom Domino
time
let's go Spain Germany come on Germany
France
France
France
um
you know France
you've been kind of an inspiration to us
on this whole Freedom thing for hundreds
of years
and we don't want you to get behind on
the whole Freedom thing
so if you wouldn't mind
setting a little example
because we like it when you do that over
here
if France can find Freedom
you would do a big favor to us in the
United States
now I'm not going to say this is you
know a Statue of Liberty size or uh you
know uh
or Lafayette we are here sized it's not
that big
but
remember France
you in America we have a like a
long-standing agreement don't we
sort of an Unwritten thing
that if you get in trouble we help you
if you get in trouble
you help us
we're in trouble over here France
if you go first
that would really help us really help us
we'd appreciate it a lot and I know
there's a lot of activity over there a
lot of people in the streets it doesn't
look like you're close to pushing your
government
but I'll bet you can do it I'll bet you
could get there and I think Boris
Johnson just made your job a little bit
easier so France be next
counting on you I think you can do it
be true to your history
be true to what made you great in the
first place all right and that
is all I have to say today
looks like my phone is blowing up and
I'll talk to you all tomorrow
