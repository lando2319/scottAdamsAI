good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
which by the way is not a very high bar
today I've seen human
civilization we've never been
worse so really if you competing with
the rest of civilization it's your time
not much competition lately but if you'd
like to take it up to levels that nobody
can even understand it's so incredible
all you need is a cup ofer glass a
tanker chelse Stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and we begin now the simultaneous sip
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to you in the whole world
go
oh yeah that's so
good so so
good well let's talk about all the news
we'll start with silly stuff as I like
to and then we'll get into the dark dark
news of which there is
plenty apparently the new South Park
viciously mocks Disney for their
wokeness now have you ever heard a te
user for a TV show of any
kind that was better than this
one is there anything that makes you
want to watch South Park more than
knowing that they're going to mock
Disney for Disney's wokeness and ruining
all the movies and turning them to
 I am so there I don't know if it's
out already but it might be out
today oh something you've already seen
it people say it's
great yeah honest to God
I can't imagine a more provocative or
inviting you know commercial for a show
definitely going to watch
that in other news the uh Pharma
industry is gearing up because we got
all these new powerful drugs to protect
us uh from
obesity that's right our food supply in
America is so
compromised that instead of trying to
fix it so that we can eat food that
doesn't kill us big Pharma is going to
invent
drugs that counteract the effects of our
food that's a real thing you you could
argue that that's always been the case
because um diabetes drugs or at least in
part fixing somebody's bad diet from the
past and you know
Etc I know there's a gen genetic
component of that
so um I don't think there could be a
signal of our civil civilization
incompetence that would be more glaring
than keep eating this poison food but
it's okay because we'll get you some
poison drugs to take care of your
problems from the poison food but what
about the side effects from the drug
that's okay we'll make another drug that
deal with the side effect from the first
drug we're so
 so
 uh well apparently I think uh on
October 30th the White House is
reportedly going to reveal a what's
called a sweeping AI executive order now
Brian relli who I often quote for his
expertise in
AI he he posted this says I can say with
certainty that some new AI companies
will relocate to a country that does not
have some of the proposed
restrictions we will lose with this
approach oh no are we really going to
make America the place you can't build
AI is that really going to
happen what what exactly are these
restrictions are the restrictions going
to be stuff like you can't scrape data
from the internet you can't train it it
might be something like you can't train
it using the internet then what do you
do don't you just relocate to
Bermuda then do what you were doing
anyway I I feel like it's St well first
of all AI could solve its own
problem am I right you could just ask
the AI hey AI there's some sweeping new
reforms what do I do now and the AI
would say move to morania and set up a
corporation and you'd be like can you do
the paperwork for me done sign here and
all of a sudden you're a mortanian
company
so so there's
that all right um according to I saw
that Jonathan turle post on X uh nearly
70% of Voters say they believe that uh
current President Biden has acted either
unethically or criminally with regard to
the you know Biden crime faom Le selling
uh selling access and stuff
70%
so you realize that we're heading as
fast as we can toward a brick wall here
right let me explain the brick
wall my guess is that by this coming
summer if Trump is not actually
you know taken off the board which I
worry about he should have a commanding
lead that would be
insurmountable for winning the 2024
election that is not going to be a
comfortable place to
be because I don't know what is the
emergency you know break
glass uh situation for the Democrats but
I don't think that they can let
him be president and be a at the same
time I I think that they've already
decided that of all the options they're
not going to have a president Trump I'm
talking about the Deep State and the bad
guys so I really worry that something
dramatic will happen around the summer
of
2024
because at the rate it's going he's your
next
president so now here's a caution I
always give
you when people make straight line
predictions like that you know the way
things are going is the way it'll still
be going next year that's never going to
work nobody's ever nobody's ever made a
successful prediction based on things
staying the same for a long time right
it just doesn't happen so when people
were asking me the last presidential
election you know what do you think
what's the slaughter meter and I was
like well it depends if something
happens between now and the election and
do you know what happened the pandemic
so you really can't predict
anything um but that's a way it would go
if nothing changed all right so that
main shooter has been found dead I'm
told that there is a press conference
who should be happening right now and uh
I'll ask anybody who uh is watching that
also if you if you have my uh
text if you know how to message me
already um yes I will ask right now send
updates on car so if anything happens um
I'll probably get a message and I'll
tell you about it
so I I'm going to I'm going to ask you
to believe something that I can't prove
well actually I could I could give you a
witness if you want a witness but I
swear to God I said this
privately privately I said that the
shooter would be found
dead in a suspicious like a place that
didn't make much sense near a
dumpster that was my actual prediction
that you would found dead near a
dumpster but wait I also
predicted that you wouldn't find his
boat
they found him reportedly in or near a
dumpster and they can't find his
boat do you remember me saying saying it
to yeah the people in the man cave heard
it
now um so the press conference is late
we'll find out so remember I told you
that reality is what predicts best
because we live in a world where our
brains are not really designed to
understand truth or reality but
sometimes you can have a a let's say a
model of how things are that does a good
job of predicting and that's as close as
you can get to reality did the thing I
predicted happen or not so I had been
somewhat whimsically saying there's
something wrong with the
story
and I was suggesting there's an
alternative explanation for everything
we see now I want to be really care
careful here I don't think the
alternative explanation is true you know
if I had to bet on it I'd bet against it
but I I took an alternative an
alternative interpretation from the one
that was in the news and I said if the
alternative interpretation is correct
here's what you could expect you'll find
his dead body near a dumpster and his
boat will be
missing
now the the hypothesis and this is trust
me I'm not trying to sell this to you as
true I'm not saying it's true I'm just
saying it was an alternative theory that
did a weirdly good job of predicting and
by the way the other theory is that he's
crazy he's crazy had a fight with his
girlfriend that's the whole story right
if you're going to go with the simple
version crazy guy does crazy stuff crazy
would explain everything that is
unexplained
it wouldn't leave much out but there are
a few things that are hard to
explain um let me give you a few of them
number one um his his video from the
cameras did not match the photo that
we're looking at different shape of face
and everything but that could easily be
explained by how could that easily be
explained one would be he'd lost weight
since the photo that would explain it
he' grown a better beard his hair had
grown out and the the angle of the
camera made his nose look different
there would be nothing unusual about
that would there that'd be completely
normal so it could be that it's just you
know the video is a little distorted
it's a different angle but you know his
photo is looking up at his nose the the
video was looking down at him changes
what your nose looks like makes
sense but
the first day I saw the the supposed
photo of them and compared to the video
I said to myself you know what if this
is real and he's a real person we'll see
a whole bunch of other photos because
everybody has other photos and then some
of those other photos would probably
look a little bit more like the video
and then I would say oh all right
but if you follow just for fun the
alternate
hypothesis that there's something going
on here and it's not really him which is
not my view I'm just saying alternate
hypothesis then what would you expect to
find about his other
photos well you'd have a weird situation
wouldn't you if all of his other photos
also did not look like the video well
then you'd have some real questions
wouldn't you so you remember all the
other photos you've seen since
Wednesday you know we've known his name
for a long time they're probably
co-workers and no there is a new one
there there is a new photo there's an
unshaved version against a some kind of
blank
background
now have you seen that
photo and have you noticed that it looks
exactly like what you expect from AI
photos it looks like
AI why is there only one person in the
world who only has one photograph
he has one photograph and one that looks
AI generated I don't know if it is but
where was that one other photo taken
what was it for might have been like an
employee ID or something because there's
a blank
background but it looks suspiciously
like AI to me now I'm not saying it is
right as I go I'm going to keep
reminding you this is not a real Theory
it's just showing you how alternate
theories can match the same facts which
is I hope the interesting part all right
so I'm going to going to build for you a
conspiracy
theory but not because I believe it's
true I'm just going to show you how well
it
predicted if he were if he were
crazy would you expect that his boat
would be wherever he usually leaves
it I would because his boat has nothing
to do with the crime right why would it
be anywhere except the last place he put
it but it seems to be
missing
next he was wearing the same
clothes that uh he was seing on the
video now you could say well that makes
sense he's crazy he's on the Run Same
Cloth but if you're on the
Run was there no point you said to
yourself I should bring a second jacket
at least a different jacket because the
jack back it was kind of you know easy
to identify or what whatever his hoodie
or whatever it was on now do you also
notice that the clothes he was wearing
were extra
baggy when is the last time you saw
anybody wearing you anybody 40 years old
wearing extra baggy clothes like that
now maybe it's cuz he lost weight it
could be just because he lost weight so
that would explain
it but if you want the conspiracy theory
explanation what would be the kind of
clothes that would be easy to put on a
corpse if you were going to say someday
I'm going to have to put these I'm going
to have to take these clothes off of my
body and put them on a corpse what kind
of clothes would you wear you would wear
the baggiest clothes you could wear
because that would be the easiest thing
to put on a corpse what did the news say
in the first
reports he was found wearing the same
same
clothes W do you think that that was an
important thing to say he was found
wearing the same
clothes have you ever heard anybody say
that about anybody else he was found
dead wearing the same
clothes
interesting and what about the uh what
about the
uh the note so we're told that there was
a suicide note suicide note now there's
a suicide note that would be confirming
that it's definitely that guy and it was
definitely mental illness and he
definitely intended to die everything's
answered where was the first story you
heard about the suicide note was it NBC
or
ABC which one NBC or ABC and then things
got a little
murky
right now do you know what NBC and ABC
are famous for
among the media Outlets that do news
what are they famous for yeah they're
kind of famous for being intelligence
agency Outlets you know places that the
uh our own intelligence people use to
plant their version of reality now that
doesn't mean that's what happened I'm
just saying I'm just describing it
now um and of course they found the gun
and the guy was known to have mental
problems and known to
uh known to the Sude he broke up with
his
girlfriend which I also predicted I
predicted that if it was actually him he
broke up with his girlfriend and maybe
he met her at that recycling plant where
near where they found his body because
that would be sort of a a message to his
ex-girlfriend that it was something
about her you know he would go to some
place that they worked or met each other
or something like that so if it's really
just just him and there's nothing
mysterious about it uh I would expect
that the place he died had some
relationship to his relationship with
his ex-girlfriend if that part of the
story is true
anyway so
um what else do we have so he's the only
person who has only one photo except for
the one that looks like AI but we don't
know if it
is um why did I why did I predict he
would f be found dead near a dumpster do
you know
why which would be very unusual wouldn't
it why did I say dead near a
dumpster CU that's how I would have done
it if if I were going to set up a fake
murder I would make sure that you found
the
person fairly soon I'd want you to find
them in a day or two but I wouldn't want
you to find them in an
hour what would be be a good place to
leave somebody that you're guaranteed
somebody will see them the next day but
there's a very little low chance they'll
see them in an hour near a dumpster
because dumpsters are places that people
go to every day but not
often right maybe once a
day so that would be a perfect place to
put a corpse that you wanted people to
find and you wanted them to find it in a
fairly specific um time or
order so I said well if it's not what it
looks like you're going to find his dead
body near a dumpster now he put He did
put some effort into escaping and he had
a
boat don't you think he could have done
a little bit more
escaping if you wanted
to um they located the what they located
the body in a box trailer a container at
the recycling
company uh the area they had searched
the area twice but they had not looked
in that
container who kills themselves inside a
container is that is that common do you
know a lot of murder a lot of people who
murder themselves and they they climb
inside a
container all right I'm seeing if
there's more on
this inside an unlocked
trailer at a recycling center where he
once
worked an unlocked trailer what would a
trailer be used for at a recycling
center to carry recycled
stuff was it an
office or or was it a trailer like
a like a mobile home trailer a trailer
office let me ask
let why wouldn't they have looked in
there the first
time let's find out what's going
on office
trailer it was a container box
trailer container box so it wasn't an
office it was a back of a
truck why would you do
that um oh oh I know
why you would do that because you knew
they were using infrared to look for you
right so he was hiding from the
infrared is that a thing does anybody
know if that would work right if you
were an animal and you were inside a
container that was metal sides the
infrared wouldn't find you so you might
have been hiding from from the infrared
which means he was watching the news
coverage which said they were going to
use infrared to find his SE signature
from
above infrared sees through metal oh
somebody well I'm not sure he knew that
did he know that no it does not some
people are
saying okay
so it wasn't a dumpster it was a
container truck next to a garbage
facility recycling but
garbage
now key key to my prediction that it was
going to be next to a
dumpster was that it would be a place
you wouldn't
expect you know more like a good place
to kill somebody than a good place to
kill yourself you know what I mean if
you watch the movie does anybody go
there there to kill themselves but it's
exactly where you go to kill somebody
else or to put a body there I suppose
now I also heard a uh report very
unverified that there were he was shot
twice I assume they would tell us if
that were the case right nobody shoots
themselves in the head
twice where is a good place to kill
yourself almost anywhere the forest the
for Forest would be the best place might
as well enjoy your last
minutes oh the forest is
nice all
right all right
so
um yeah there's something sketchy about
this I would wait to see if we see a
picture of the
note I'd want to see a picture of it I
want to know they match the
handwriting which they probably will but
if it's what it looks like it's some
kind of you know op some intelligence op
this would be the point where the
authorities would start just agreeing
with whoever told them to say whatever
they say so you could be hearing you
know if under the
theory under the theory that there's
something going on here that's not
obvious everybody would now be on board
with the same Theory so everybody would
have the same story because by now you
know law enforcement would have to get
on board and probably just agree with
stuff so here's what I further
predict if the situation is as clean as
it could be crazy guy gets a gun two
days before he killed people killed a
bunch of people it's probably exactly
that so if you were going to
predict based on that theory what would
you predict next well I would predict
that all the all the facts would come
into play and they would all support the
same narrative you know you'd find that
the uh handwriting matches on the Note
the note very clearly shows his
intentions he bought the gun that you
know the day before the shooting or the
day before he was uh diagnosed as having
some mental problems I think and uh he
just didn't change his clothes because
he was on the run and he's crazy he only
had one good photo but maybe May there
are lots of good photos we just didn't
have time to find
them but here's here's what you would
find if it's
fake if it's fake you're going to find
some kind of
Mega um Trump supporting
messages now some I saw some reports
that didn't sound real that he' said
some stuff on social media but it's
impossible that he said things on social
media if they only have one photo of
them I mean is he is the one person who
has never put his picture on social
media
so look for what is his social media
profile because I've heard nothing about
it have you heard anything about his
social
media is he the only 40-year-old who has
no social
media that would be very
rare yeah there there's one uh 4chan
thing that looks fake to me so I'm not
even going to mention that so there's
some fake
manifestos but if it's an
OP it's about
Trump remember remember I was saying you
know we're waiting for the next op
there's going to be an OP what would be
the better op than a magga
extremist killing
people that would be the best op of all
wouldn't it Mega extremist with a
high-powered gun
what what is more on the nose than magga
extremist with high-powered gun that he
easily purchased even in the context of
mental
health right oh even crazy people can
get high-powered guns but the important
thing is he's got to be a magga
supporter like not just Republican he's
got to be magga he's going to be Pro
Trump so do you expect that to
happen
so here's my
prediction if it's a straightforward
story we'll hear some perfectly
reasonable reason why there are no good
photos of him except the one that looks
suspicious there might be a perfectly
good reason like uh his friends say he
never likes social
media all by that his his friend says he
doesn't use social media totally totally
I'm done yeah okay that's not that crazy
there are some people who don't
but if there's no indication that he did
anything but make a few anti-trump posts
or or prot Trump po
posts it's going to look pretty
suspicious all right let me see we have
two pictures of
him all right we've got
his looks like there's only two pictures
yeah they don't look like the same
guy all right oh here we
go note was found at his home it was not
fully a suicide
note but it had his passcodes and where
to find items once he was
gone well that's a suicide note isn't
it and now if it were an
OP it would be more
suicidy right so if somebody were like
making him write the note they probably
would have said and say you plan to end
it all today after you shoot people or
I'll kill you right
now um but it has his passcodes and
where to find items once he was
gone H so we have a suicide note that
lacks motive except we heard heard
voices and
stuff
H so so so we have a
non-standard situation with his
photos and in a non-standard situation
where he was found and a non-standard
suicide
note
huh well that the suicide note is kind
of ambiguous in terms of what theory it
supports anyway so one theory is that he
was the perfect py because he was a gun
Guy and because he had mental problems
and also a gun so if you knew somebody
like that he'd be the perfect person to
be your uh py but I'm not saying that's
what happened it's probably exactly what
it looks like crazy guy with gun but
we'll see all right I saw that George
Bush threw out the first pitch at is it
the World Series is the World Series
happening now I'm so not caring about
baseball all right so George Bush threw
down of course you know bounced once or
twice before it reached the home plate
uh cuz he's a certain age is George in
his 80s now he
77 you know at 77 he looks you know he
looks spry I thought he was actually
going to throw a strike you CU George
Bush was in good shape
but that's because Biden can't do it
right that's why
right because Biden wouldn't be able to
throw it without falling over or if he
threw it it would just be you know like
pushing it
you know I I feel like Biden has become
uh Mr Burns from The
Simpsons do you know that comic that
character Mr
Burns he he's always represented as
being so so weak that he can't he can
barely lift
anything well Taylor Swift is a
billionaire they say I don't know how
anybody would really know but uh I heard
I heard a story about a clever business
thing
did which is she made a movie of her
tour so it turned it into a film but
instead of releasing it through a studio
which is the normal way everything's
done she asked the following question
what's the studio
adding what are they
doing wait why am I giving them most of
my
money it's because they know the phone
number of the uh movie
theaters that's it they they're the the
ones who go to the movie theaters and
say hey do you want to run this
movie that's what they do and then then
they publicize it so it's publicity and
distribution but they don't do the
distribution they simply call the people
who do and say hey I got another
one so Taylor Swift said um why do I
need
publicity is is there somebody somebody
who hasn't heard of me
or if I just tweet to my bazillion fans
that I have a movie you don't think I
can fill all the
theaters so she was like well I don't
need publicity I can do that myself and
then she said I already made the movie I
hired my own photog you know
videographers movie's already done I
don't need the studio to make it I don't
need them to promote
it but what about that phone call that
they make to the studios and then she
thought what if I call the what if I
call call the actual uh movie theater
chain and say you want to buy this
directly from me are they going to say
no to a Taylor
Swift video that would probably be their
most profitable thing they'll do of
course I said yes so but as the the
person I heard I first heard this from I
don't know who it was on the news uh the
real the real story here is that she
found a model that any celebrity could
use if Tom Cruz decides to make a new
movie are you not going to hear about it
because there was no Studio
involved no you'll hear about it and if
the movie theater said to Tom Cruz hey
Tom will you know if he called the
theater directly do you think the
theater would say no we must get this
from a studio no they would they would
take it on so it could be the studios
are just you know on the way out except
for small movies that need the
promotional
muscle so that's sort of a big Taylor
Swift thing she does make good business
moves
um all right so I got to tell you an
experience I had yesterday I went on a
spaces that's the audio feature on the
xplatform listening to people who were
very Pro
Palestinian not pro Hamas
Palestinian and so I listened to their
whole conversation and how they framed
everything from the October 7th to what
Israel is doing in Gaza now and what I
learned was at least among this group
you know it wasn't everybody in the
world but it was people on the xplatform
who were Pro
Palestinian to them it seemed like the
Hamas element wasn't
important
let me say that again nobody there
seemed to think that the Hamas attack on
Israel was especially important to
anything that was
happening I mean I I didn't know what it
was like being in Another Universe
here's their interpretation I I don't
endorse this but you should hear it
their interpretation is that the Hamas
attack is another small scene in a much
larger movie that is Israel trying to
depopulate Palestinian held lands in
their
opinion so that the Hamas thing was sort
of just an obvious thing that would
happen within that text they say that is
Israel versus the Palestinians and that
it's always been a trick they would say
that Israel ever wanted to live in peace
so their version is that Israel is
trying to do everything it can to
squeeze the Palestinians into just
leaving you know so it would be like
they're leaving on their own but we made
it so hard to live there through a
variety of our tricks that you know
we're just we're just colonizers
basically now I'm not endorsing that
view but if you don't know it
exists you're not going to understand
anything you see so apparently there was
a huge Pro Palestinian um protest in uh
Grand Central and they filled the entire
Grand Central with protesters now I'm
guessing most of them are just Democrats
like I don't I don't think they're
actual Palestinians I think they're just
Democrats who um agree and so I saw this
you know huge huge group of Democrats
now here's the good news totally
peaceful and I'm going to give them
credit for that you know given given how
high the uh emotions are that was a lot
of people to put in one SM Bas and
peaceful so I'm going to give him that I
I'll give you that check box good job on
the peaceful part but my take on it was
um the last time I saw that many people
in one
place who didn't understand how cause
and effect works I think it was the
Democrat National Convention of
2020 somebody says
BLM I think BLM was more of a you know a
money thing all
right so just know
that
um is anybody having a uh
problem with supporting either
side here's our
dilemma if you were to support Israel
which I do you will be called a person
who supports genocide by people who
don't like Israel or at least don't like
what they're
doing so simply simply supporting Israel
as I do puts me in the category that I
will be blamed by other citizens and a
lot of them of supporting genocide much
like
1939 um Germany now I say to myself how
in the world could those Germans have
you know the Holocaust to be happening
if they were somewhat even a little bit
aware of it at all all right so if you
support Israel obviously you'll be uh
called a supporter of a genocide a Nazi
by all the people who are opposed to it
and there are a lot of them I mean in
the world and in the country there are a
lot of them now suppose you go the other
way and you say no no no I'm I'm
anti-israel you say and I support those
Palestinians how can you really support
the Palestinians without
supporting
genocide because there are enough of the
Palestinians who are Hamas in their
views that if you were simply say hey
let them alone and let them live in
peace you basically would be supporting
them eventually doing another Mass
killing and if they got powerful enough
their ambition is to essentially
depopulate Jews from
Israel so you have two choices to be a
supporter of a
genocide it doesn't matter which side
you take now you could maybe convince
yourself you're on the good side which I
do every
day but keep in mind that you know some
large percentage of the world population
will think you support genocide and will
go to their graves thinking that they
will always think it
whichever side you you you
take now so what's the
solution well I saw some videos where uh
children Palestinian children and then
also Jewish children
were uh interviewed in the first case
and the little Palestinians said stuff
like they teach us in school that Jews
are bad peoplee I am ready to stab a Jew
and step on him quote we have to start
to war and show the Jews we are stronger
quote they teach us that Jews are
terrorists quote I'm going to run them
over and stab them qu I'm ready to be a
suicide bomber these were maybe 9year
olds N9 or 10 year
olds and you say to yourself my God
they're brainwashing him like crazy well
it took about a minute for somebody to
say um here's a video inside of Israel
in which uh Israeli kids in a look like
a Jewish religion um class were being
taught things that weren't um I don't
know if they were as violent as this but
they were as racist it was similarly
racist it was just the reverse of it
without with a little less violence I
think now how do you fix
that so so there's one rule that
everybody agrees with you don't kill
children right can can we all agree with
that you can't kill children
but if you don't you support
genocide let's be very clear about that
if you oppose killing children in the
Middle
East you support genocide because
they're they're weaponized the the
children are they have the weaponized
virus in their mind that they're going
to grow up and try to kill Jews so if
you're okay with them just growing
up causeing fact it's a pretty much you
know one two three
genocide so how can you be opposed to
killing
children and also opposed to
genocide you don't have the choice you
either got to be Pro killing children or
jailing them until they're
irrelevant or you are in favor of
genocide because either the you either
genocide the children which nobody's in
favor of
or you allow them to grow up and
genocide you which no one is in favor of
so you tell
me how how do I how do I finish my life
on this planet without supporting
genocide give me any give me any path I
can
take what's my path I I could say um I'm
uninvolved and I disavow everybody I
could say that but then I would be what
tacitly approving of genocide you know
so you're approving it by your actions
but you're also improve you're also
supporting it by your inactions and you
don't have a second choice you're in the
same boat as as I am you can take a side
but I'll tell you you're supporting
genocide whichever side you take because
they've created a
situation you know um location is
Destiny and design is Destiny they've
created a location
and a civilization design that
guarantees the complete genocide of one
of them if not both how else could it Go
you've designed it that way you you just
plopped people in the middle of this sea
of
hate how do you solve that so unless you
gain control of the education systems of
all of your neighboring countries and
how's that going to happen you're going
to end up with the same thing so you're
just recreating the same problem
generation after Generation Now what
will the Palestinians think after this
year will they think oh it was a big
mistake it didn't work out I guess we
definitely don't have to go do bad
things to Israel no they're going to be
like a thousand times more dedicated to
it every single child who survives there
is going to be a you know a terrorist
when you're done so short of
genocide you tell me the
solution you want to be
really really uh scared I did a poll on
X to ask people if they were in favor of
genocide that's where we are and it was
a serious question do you know what the
results
were about 25% said yes it depends well
it depends meaning there is a situation
in which it makes sense
and the situation is
self-defense so if you had to have a
genocide to save your
family about a quarter of the people
said yeah but there are actually more
people who just if you had the people
who just said directly yes there were a
lot of people in favor of genocide right
today your neighbors yeah yeah your
neighbors are a lot of your neighbors be
actually in favor of
genocide now here's a question I asked
just to know how dicey this is so
yesterday I asked people to put in the
comments of a of a post to tell me what
number of Civilian deaths in
Gaza their their mind at least mentally
they would say oh that has moved from
self-defense into
genocide because you should be able to
say that number if you're going to have
an opinion of whether it is or is not a
genocide so we would agree that if
Israel killed every man woman and child
in Gaza that would be genocide right
everybody would agree with that and we
also agree that if they killed zero
civilians miraculously if somehow that
were possible and killed every one of
the Hamas Fighters totally justified and
we would say wow good job right so it
could be self-defense if zero civilian
die it could be a genocide if 100% of
everybody
died somewhere in between there's a
crossover if you don't know what that
crossover is you should shut the
up about this topic in my opinion if you
can't put a number on it shut the
up because you're a
coward you're a coward if you can't put
a number on it so I'm going to do it
20,000 in my opinion and by the way this
is my opinion of how other people will
think not my opinion of my personal
opinion it's my opinion of how others
will see it given the severity of the
Hamas attack everybody expects way too
many civilian casualties but we also
know it's War we also know terrible
choices so there's some number that is a
horrific number that much of the world
will say you know what you know it's not
Israel's fault they had to do what they
had to do there's some
number I'm going to say
20,000 and I have no idea where it lend
up I don't know if it'll end up north
out of South I'm pretty sure that um we
won't know the real number because there
probably will be a Hamas you know lie
there might be an official number who
knows if you could believe the official
number either so I'm looking at the
comments they're they're pro pro
genocide comments right here in the real
world there are pro I mean you see them
everywhere so ask yourself if you were
in Nazi Germany in
1939 would you have gone along with the
Holocaust and
Hiller I have the answer for you and the
answer is yes yes you would
have unfortunately that's who we are as
a as a species we very easily go to
genocide as well I had no choice
probably probably hler thought he had no
choice or argued he did something like
that so we're pushed into a position
where we all have to deal with the fact
that we're going to support genocide on
one side or the
other and you hope your own side doesn't
Define it that way that's the best you
can do you know you can hang around with
people who didn't Define it that way
then you don't feel so bad but
somebody's going to Define whatever ever
you support it is genocide and there's
no way about no way around it so you say
to yourself well just be not involved
and not say anything not good enough not
good enough you tacitly support it if
you don't say
anything so we're all supporters of
genocide according to the
rules um so that's
suboptimal so here's a little more about
the uh attack yesterday on
Gaza
um by the way there was one other person
who gave an estimate he said
50,000 now not commenting on his
estimate I'll only comment that there
was only one person brave enough to put
a number on it do you know why nobody
else wanted to put a number on
it why do you think everybody avoided
the question like I've never seen I've
never seen anybody avoid a question as
much as that one you know
why CU on some level we we know we're
all
complicit we're all complicit whichever
way this goes we're all kind of
complicit I wish we
weren't but the the do nothing
scenario kind of makes you
complicit now on here here's the only uh
mental defense that I can give you you
don't have a choice right Israel is
going to do what Israel does your
opinion doesn't make any difference so
you can have an opinion on it but it
won't change the
outcome so I'm going to tell you that
there is some number that will work out
worse for
Israel than if they stay below the
number I think and this is just a cycle
oh let me test this on you I'll just
test my number now remember this isn't
your own opinion give me the opinion of
what the world will consider way past
the line I say
20,000 is the point where where the
world can't handle
it I'm seeing numbers like 10K 5,000
35,000 I think a
100,000 would be genocide for sure what
do you say civilians if it's 100,000
civilians I don't think it's going to
reach that level the only way it could
reach that level is if Hamas started
killing their own people and it was mass
starvation and they didn't let them out
but that's possible
yeah so you think about 20,000 now
here's the problem Hamas is going to say
20,000 by you know
tomorrow and Israel will will say there
was never anywhere near that number
whether there is or not right so we'll
never know there there it's an
unknowable number in the end but if
there's an official numbers coming out
in that 20,000
range that's where that's where it
wasn't worth the uh probably wasn't
worth the fight because you end up worse
off than
before now it will be worth the fight in
terms of how uh the Israelis feel about
it because normally I would say you
don't want to have a war over your
feelings wouldn't you agree the the
worst reason to have a war is about your
feelings you know because you feel
afraid or something but I would argue
against that I would argue that you
could not be a resident of Israel today
without knowing that your army had
absolutely eliminated homas no matter
what it took no matter what it took you
wouldn't even be able to live there so I
would say that self-defense is very much
in play here and I don't I don't
criticize
Israel for doing what it needs to do to
heal the brains of its citizens it's
like an entire country with severe brain
damage and don't expect them to act
completely rational because they're
fixing they're fixing also a brain
problem and that might require uh a
severity of of action that you wouldn't
normally approve of because there might
be no other way to make their brains say
all right that should that should make
us safer a
while so I think Israel had to do what
they had to do all right so they did a
big push and a lot of bombing and they
had some boots on the ground but it
wasn't they say the big push here's what
they were trying to do they were
apparently this was being reported by
Fox News today they were trying to uh
put pressure on Hamas to maybe get the
hostage negotiations working a little
better now do you know what my do you
remember my military suggestion so my
military suggestion was exactly this so
I'm no military expert but you're also
managing you know hearts and minds and
World opinion and what I thought is that
Israel has to be have the maximum amount
of force short of a full-on ground
Invasion and they need to just ride the
situation as long as possible today
tomorrow next day now they do have an
issue that they have so many um people
in uniform that the rest of the country
isn't going to work right the people in
uniform at least you know half of them
or more need to get back to their day
jobs cuz it's a pretty big uh takeway
from the
economy and they're not going to be you
know they're not going to be as uh High
morale in 3 months as they are in day
one you know they're they're gungho to
get in there but I think so anyway what
we have is a rate problem not a yes no
problem um if you've talked to anybody
from Israel
they will talk yes
no there will be a conversation will go
like this all right I think maybe you
should go slow but of course you have to
eliminate Hamas no matter
what well why would we go slow we have
to get rid of Hamas I know but you can
make it worse if there are too many
civilian casualties so go slow but
definitely whatever you do don't don't
leave any possibility that Hamas can
survive it's a hard convers ation
because they just want Hamas
dead wouldn't you isn't that exactly
what you would want if You' watched your
children be slaughtered are you going to
say no no don't hurt their
children well I've never had my children
slaughtered in front of me but if I did
I wouldn't be caring about the children
of somebody else at the
moment I wish I wish I were such a big
person that I could care about that but
I'm
not so
so at the moment it appears to me that
Israel is doing exactly what I would
have
done I'm not sure that's a good thing
but what I would have done is uh probe
bomb probe bomb negotiate probe bomb
shrink the battlefield you know you just
bomb the perimeter until it gets smaller
and smaller and just keep negotiating I
would negotiate until the last tamas
killer was was dead
just keep saying you're negotiating and
never stop saying it so you and you have
to also keep saying this isn't the
ground Invasion well was that the ground
Invasion no no no that wasn't the ground
Invasion the big one's
coming and basically it is a ground
Invasion you're just doing it in chunks
so you're still doing the ground
Invasion but you're doing it in the
smartest you know
lowest uh cost of human lives on the
Israel side and you you just squeeze
them squeeze them squeeze them in theory
the hungrier they get the longer they go
without electricity the longer they go
that the internet the more likely that
they're going to give up a hostage or
two so I think everybody requires them
to go about the way they're going but
they also have the advantage that
there's a kind of a news black hole so
the news isn't going to know exactly how
hard they went right so Israel could say
that wasn't the ground Invasion even if
it was totally the ground Invasion and
then maybe they clear an area and pull
back maybe they invade again and pull
back so it could be that I've heard the
experts say this would be way more way
worse than mosul you know way worse than
your normal street fighting so maybe
they don't do that maybe they don't do
it in a normal way I wouldn't I I would
just keep blowing up structures and
shrinking God
cuz in the end gaza's the buildings
aren't going to be worth a damn do you
think do you think there's any building
in Gaza that's worth rebuilding but at
this point probably everything is going
to be damaged Beyond repair at least in
the northern part where they're
focusing
so
um never disturb the enemy when they're
making
mistakes you're recommending what
they're doing right exactly I am
recommending what they're doing but I
also recommended it before they did it
so I'm just just commenting that uh it
looks like they're doing it the smartest
way would you
agree it looks like it's the smartest
way they could do
it but you remember your news is going
to be all massaged so whatever you hear
from this point on the credibility has
to go way down because anything you hear
coming out of the war zone will become
from the participants
your ego pat pat I'm sorry your ego is
so
destroyed Pat Fraser she just yelled in
all caps your ego I don't know if you
noticed but this is a show in which I
make predictions and then I tell you how
they
did can you handle that can can your
fragile ego handle that sometimes they
be wrong and sometimes they'll be right
but in the Pro process of doing it we'll
all have this education about what
things predict well and what don't for
example when I taught you to ignore
Anonymous sources and then a then a news
report came out that said an anonymous
source says Mark Meadows wore a wire to
talk to
Trump everybody who learned how to
predict already knew that anonymous
source especially from certain Outlets
always means not true not sometimes it
always means not true so that's
something that people who follow this uh
live stream have learned and many of
them told me as soon as that story broke
they looked for the source source was
Anonymous and then they knew it wasn't
true and then they waited a day and sure
enough it wasn't
true
so so maybe you should work on your
ego
all
right
um yeah let's say uh let's see if
there's an
update on this
guy so not much of an update
um let me just
ask
oh let let me say say this as often as I
need
to I'm not operating under a free speech
umbrella right now so things that I say
um especially about uh the Middle East
just assume that I'm censoring
myself so that I can still be a public
figure stay in a jail and stuff like
that right
so you you should you should adjust in
your
mind that I'm uh in this topic
specifically I'm not attempting to be
unbiased do you hear that I'm making no
attempt to be
unbiased on this topic I'm completely
biased so I'm
pro-israel it's not free I mean whatever
stand you take it's not free but they
are our allies I do have you know lots
of friends in that world and I support
my friends and if I were if this had
happened inica America I would want to
kill all of them and it's not it's not
up to me so I I do support self-defense
without
restrictions and that's what we're
seeing I support
self-defense without
restrictions in all cases now that
doesn't mean it will be a good idea to
have no no control on your self-defense
I'm not saying that I'm saying I'm not
going to judge you if you're extreme in
self-defense I might not like
it I might not like it might not even be
what I would do but I'm not going to
judge
it cuz you get you get to decide the the
victims get to decide what self-defense
looks like period you know if I hear
that somebody was like physically
abusing a spouse and the spouse you know
tied up her partner and tortured him in
a chair and then then blew his head off
which would seem out of proportion to
you know maybe what the abuse was I
don't give a that was up to the
abused person to handle it now they
might go to
jail because it was too far but I'm not
going to judge them if you take out your
bully you're always going to be okay
with me no matter how you did
it if there's a bully in well I don't
want to go that far
um
what there are
quote uh this is on the uh the mass
shooter
guy they don't want to say anything
about these
self-inflicted shots
plural detectives cannot disclose at
this
time all right now which which
hypothesis does this support does this
support he was just a crazy guy who took
his life remember he's a gun expert and
the only thing he had to do is shoot
himself in the head it's all he had to
do two
shots which which Theory does that
support it supports the theory that
there's something up that it's an
OP right have you ever heard of anybody
committing suicide with two
shots the Press asked if the police had
video of the
shooting and they said they were going
through the videos is under
investigation oh video the
shooting that's interesting why have we
only seen
Stills is that
if there were video cameras can you
think of one other time that it was a
major story and they didn't show you the
video is that because the victim privacy
cuz I wouldn't I wouldn't want to see my
family member being murdered on
TV interesting have uh has anybody said
yet uh if he's a magga supporter because
that would be the next part of my
hypothesis
not that he is one that it would be
reported that
way not
yet so if we don't know if he's a magga
supporter all right does he have social
media and is he
registered
Republican
um was the gun
semi-automatic
oh all right here here's a interesting
idea that if he committed suicide with a
semi-automatic if he pulled the trigger
once could there be two
shots
no it it would have to be fully
automatic or a bump
stock I'm getting yeses and NOS there
about a thousand you know gun experts on
this on this live stream there are
probably more more gun users on this
live stream than any place in the
world so if it was fully automatic yes
but he probably didn't have a fully
automatic
weapon okay so there's no comment yet on
whether he had social
media uh or that he was registered to
one political party or another does that
sound does that sound like the
truth how in the world do you not know
his political
standing or whether or not he had social
media and how he got around to the
trailer uh uh but it was walking
distance it does suggest there was
another vehicle
involved so I thought the place they
found the body was walking distance from
his
car oh it was walking dist I mean if if
you were running from the
authorities 7 mil isn't a big distance
to cover on foot right I don't know how
many miles it was but it I think it was
just like a few miles so walking
distance yeah I think walking
distance all right so the man who has
suspiciously no social media
suspiciously no political views and
suspiciously one picture that looks real
from his driver's license but the only
other picture of him looks like
AI in
was wearing super baggy clothes that
don't look like him there's no video of
it but we got a
still do you think it's because the
video show his face
better I doubt it it's 8 Miles Away
somebody
said why would somebody shoot him twice
because the first shot was necessary to
control them
maybe
yeah his car was left by the boats but
walking distance and let's see no boat
is found
right where would the boat
be all right keep in
mind keep in mind that allegedly he left
a note describing his access
codes no no boat mentioned the boat
wasn't
mentioned
H how was that not
mentioned I mean seriously how do you
not mention his boat he parked his car
near a boat
dock all right here's what makes more
sense again this is just speculative
entertainment right I'm not saying this
is true what makes more sense is that he
he the real killer killed
car drove him to this
place um actually probably killed him
there and then uh did his dirty work and
then parked his car walking distance and
got on his boat and went
away if they never find the boat I'm
going to have real
questions
um yeah he's going to park nearo do he's
is going to drive all the way to a
dock where his boat
isn't that that was his plan to drive to
the dock where his boat is
not all right at the very least would
you agree that this is not going to look
solved that there will be more questions
than there are answered you you could
feel this developing couldn't you like
that it wouldn't be uh open and shut
like most of the mass shootings are
mostly the mass shootings are there's no
question who did it and very quickly
there's no question
why all right space aliens could be
a shape
shifter Bo was sank offshore and then he
swam to
another that wouldn't be a bad way to go
if he had a dinghy with him you dragged
it
along sinks his
boat uh near where his second car is and
then takes the second
car a 15t boat is easy to sink well if
you have a gun it's pretty easy don't
you just take a few shots through the
bottom of the boat and
wait you just anchor it put a couple of
bullets in the bottom and sail away on
your
dinghy some boats don't
sink
oh interesting some people are saying it
wouldn't s completely it would maybe
flip over or something okay good to know
if you blew the bottom out of the boat
like a giant hole it still wouldn't
sink they make them so floaty that
they'll they'll stay in the water even
without full of water foam filled
cavities oh okay so I guess they're very
floaty but I would imagine uh I would
imagine there are different kinds of
boats they can't all be
floaty something tells me the fishing
boats are not
floaty I feel like the recreational ones
you know may have that safety feature
built in but I feel like a fishing boat
they're like give me the minimum that'll
get me a
fish a 15t boat does not have a dinghy
but it could have no I'm talking about
somebody in the trying to cover up a
murder all you'd have to do is uh not a
dinghy but you know a row booat canoe
you me just drag along you just have a
canoe on your boat
itself it was a 70s fishing boat they
say I don't know I think his' 70s
fishing boat would
sink what do you think I don't know
anything about
boats uh I see a note that says he broke
up with his girlfriend because he had a
he had a small dingy
could
be all right um the owner of the
recycling company called police for them
to
check
what what the owner of the recycling
company called police for them to check
the box
trailers that's a pretty specific
suggestion hey have you checked the Box
trailers behind my of all the places in
the town he actually suspected the guy
was in one of his box
trailers interesting maybe somebody
heard something I don't know uh the
police are still trying to get into his
phone well that'll be interesting CU you
know what his phone would tell
them
wait question all right I have a
question for the techie hackers here do
they need to get into his phone in order
to know uh what path he took or can they
get that through the
cloud would they be able to trace where
he went based on his cell
signals the cell the cell tower how's it
right no cell
towers somebody
says provider can provide yeah I I
always thought that the service
provider could tell you where somebody's
been they could get it from the S
company all right
so so by now they should know if he's
the right
guy but on the other hand if the real
killer took the corpse with him or took
the guy's phone with him then the real
killer should have would have created a
track record that was actually his
instead of the owner of the phone so now
remember under the weird speculative
theory that it's some kind of major
op the next thing you could predict
would be that he's a big Mega supporter
anybody want to take a
bet if it's an OP there's a reason for
it and if it's an OP it's somebody who
was really good at this so it have to be
somebody who's a professional like
really a professional
better professional than you used to and
it would have to have a
purpose and the only purpose that
presents itself is to make it clear that
magga people are
dangerous and that Trump cannot be
allowed in because he approves of
weapons like this even for crazy people
even if he
doesn't
all right uh that's all we know for now
so I'm going to go do something else
we'll keep an eye on this story I hope
today's uh live stream was not too
alarming is there any topic we missed
while we're talking about
this the shelter in place was lifted
yeah there's some question about the
timing of the shelter in place but that
sounds more like a maybe a
miscommunication or
something uh show us the latest Dilbert
you want to see the latest Dilbert that
you don't get to see I'll do that for
you so subscribers get to see Dilbert
reborn every day either on the xplatform
or on the locals
platform um but the question was
today now before I show you this I
should tell you that Elon Musk does
subscribe
so he's one of the people on the
xplatform who gets to see the comic now
that's important because today's comic
is about Elon Musk so it's just the boss
is talking to Dilbert they both have
their phones out the boss says wide-eyed
the boss says Elon Musk just messaged me
they ask if I want to be the first human
to go to Mars and the boss still
excitedly reading says he says there's a
5% chance of survival and something
about not wanting to hurt him monkey
blah blah blah then he says to Dilbert
what do you think and Dilbert is still
looking at his phone says I think you
should do
it I think you should do
it all right I always think how weird is
it to be Elon
Musk like like most of you when you're
watching the news it's about other
people but when Elon Musk looks at the
news like every other story is about him
and now and now he you know wants to
have like a comic just to have some fun
and the comics about
him it's like every every time you open
something it's about him how weird would
that be I mean it happens to me enough
that I talk about it like I I have also
the experience of I'll just click on an
interesting news story because I think
the topic is interesting and then some
part of the story is about me like well
the hell am I in this story get me out
of this story
uh I I love there was a story what was
it
saying there was something I was just
joking
about oh I joked I've been joking you
know every day that we didn't have a
speaker at the house I joked that
everything was fine and you maybe we
don't need one and then somebody wrote a
big article talking about how right-wing
influencers I'm not even right-wing now
right-wing influencers are so crazy that
they think think we'd be better off
without a speaker of the
house now none of you were stupid enough
to think I meant that
seriously right did anybody think I
really thought we should never have a
speaker of the house so that Congress
would just sit there being paid and
never do
anything that's actually something
somebody wrote a serious article in
which they supposed I meant that
literally
and and you know I clicked on the
article because it was interesting and
I'm like and rightwing influencer what
Scott Adams says you know we're better
off without
what so that's how I read the news it's
like God damn it it's about me again and
they made all this up now have I
ever told
you that the news about public
figures is always
fake if you think it's usually true but
sometimes I get it wrong you're so lost
no it's never true it's never true in
context individual things are true I did
those tweets but the interpretation is
