well let's see if i've printed out my
notes properly
oh yes i have what a day what a day
well i'm hidden by youtube more than
normal today you say
hmm is it my imagination or if you
notice
that all the people that you talked
with on twitter let's say two years ago
has decreased by about 90
there's something weird happening on
twitter lately
i don't know what it is is it just that
the weather got better
people are outdoors because this weekend
twitter was just
quiet politically is it because biden is
so
boring is that why i don't know
but let's enjoy the simultaneous sip and
all you need is a couple of margarita
glasses thank you chelsea's steiner
candy drink a flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
somebody says in the comments i'm out
well that didn't take you long
thanks for staying for all the good
content
well let's talk about all the things
um
apparently there's a poll that says 30
percent of the public
uh thinks biden didn't win
so cnn's harriet and thinks it's a crazy
number
and that uh it's just insane
that 30 percent of the country thinks
that uh
biden didn't win and cnn is uh quite
puzzled as to why it is
that so much of the public doesn't
believe what they saw on the news
did do you see any problem here
so the news once you start seeing this
pattern
you can't unsee it the news creates the
problem
and then they report on it the problem
that they totally caused
and they reported on it like they didn't
cause it and then they assign blame to
whoever they want to assign blame to
it's obvious to me that if the
news were a credible entity
people would believe what they were told
and if the news said this election is
perfectly fine
and the news were a credible source of
information
maybe a lot of people would believe but
you can't
you can't make up the news for years in
a row
just make up the news just make up stuff
find people hoax bleach oaks
over feeding the fish oaks russia
collusion hoax
and then cnn is like what is causing
people to distrust
the official news i wonder what causes
that
it's always the news the news is the
cause of the problem
they're not the people reporting on it
they're the cause
and when you see it you cannot see it
um interestingly the dilbert nft that's
a digital collectible
that's connected to the blockchain so
you know what you know you can get an
original sold for thousand three hundred
dollars yesterday
the naughty version did clean version
sold for five thousand
but the uh the naughty version is
immediately relisted
by whoever bought it for 21 million
dollars
so if you have 21 million dollars
you could own a piece of digital art
feels a little overpriced but you never
know
you never know i was told today that the
buyer
who would like to remain anonymous uh is
a
fan of my books that teach you how to
have how to put an anchor down so so
people expect the price to be high
so so he's got it there at 21 million
if he lowers it someday to a million is
it gonna look cheap
if this works i tell you if this works
it'll be the funniest thing that ever
happened
and i don't think it'll work but you
know so here's my tip on
anchoring it's always a good technique
to you know put out a big number when
you're negotiating
because once people have heard the big
number they're biased toward it just
because it's the first number they heard
but if you make your first number so
high
that it doesn't seem real i'm not sure
the anchoring works
but it might i i can't rule it out
it actually might so it's entirely
possible that listing this for 21
million
will someday cause somebody to spend a
million dollars on it
i mean it's not impossible it's just
unlikely
so here's a thing which i i didn't quite
expect
but maybe i should have in where i live
uh and i guess everywhere it's legal to
not wear a mask when you're outdoors in
fact it's not even recommended
if you're outdoors by yourself you're
going on a run you're riding your bike
you're walking the dog
no mask required as the best medical
advice
what do you think they're doing in my
town
wearing masks if you see somebody
walking a dog
by themselves just one person and a dog
with no other human you know outside of
a car
that you can even see like literally
there's no other human beings
within your visual plane in any distance
just one person walking a dog
in my town that person will wear a mask
today
today yesterday i uh
rode my my e-bike into town just to
see that the town had been closed off
for outdoor dining
so the main street in my town is closed
all the restaurants move their chairs
out to the center of the streets
and and it's just a restaurant town now
which is kind of cool it's actually an
upgrade
i like a lot eating outdoors is just
better in california
and uh so
so i'm looking around and i'm not
wearing my mask
because i'm on a bicycle but the number
of people who were
also on bicycles and jogging by
themselves
wearing masks is crazy and
i'm trying to figure out what's going on
and i have
two hypotheses both of them might be
true one is
that people are just still frightened
uh well maybe more than one hypothesis
one is
that people are signaling their
political affiliation
i i guarantee you that the people i see
walking with no mask
are republicans or conservatives
and i guarantee you that the people
walking all by themselves
with just a dog or just by themselves i
guarantee they're democrats
now i'm not going to the next level
where i'm saying oh
democrats are dumb they don't believe
the science
i'm not saying that i feel as if we've
reached a point
where people need to signal their
allegiance because they don't want to be
misidentified
imagine if you were let's say you lived
in my neighborhood which is
overwhelmingly
you know blue democrat you live in my
neighborhood and you walked outside
without a mask
and you're just walking your dog how
many people would think you're a
republican
think about it in my town if you just
took a walk
completely legal recommended with no
mask
everybody who drove by would think their
neighbor was a republican
right i feel as if people won't take the
mask off
yet because they don't want to be id'd
by their neighbors as republicans
because they're not right the people who
are republicans just take their mask off
i think
at least that's what it looks like um
and then the other thing is i think
people are addicted to
having masks on you know uh
except for the itchiness for some reason
my mask itches like crazy that's my
biggest problem
but i thought i've actually come to
appreciate wearing the mask in public
has anybody had this experience yet if i
get my own choice i'm not going to wear
masks
of course but that is not to say that
they are completely without benefit
on top of whatever they might or may or
may not do medically
there is something comforting about
wearing a mask in public
has anybody felt it that you're in a
crowd
and you you just get to hide a little
bit better i've often thought that one
of the main reasons
that men grow beards is it lets them
hide one of the reasons that women wear
makeup
is it hides their natural appearance
makes you look better
so if you could take away the fact that
it's extremely uncomfortable
i kind of like it socially weirdly
you're not enough that i'd want to keep
it
but i think i feel like a lot of people
are just preferring it
they actually developed a preference for
it all right
i've been telling you that we have we're
right on the cusp of entering the golden
age
the pandemic has to get a little bit
more under control before that's real
but one of the ways you could tell
you're in the golden age
is if your biggest problems aren't real
right if you've got big problems that
are real
well that's not the golden age but if
your biggest problems like number one
and number two
or not even especially real you're in
pretty good shape
so what's the case today what would
let's say
democrats say are the biggest risks
or the biggest problems in the country
well they'd say climate change
and there's a big chunk of the country
that doesn't even know if it's a problem
or not
how would you like your biggest problem
to be one that people
aren't even sure they could even tell
it's a problem
you just look at it i don't know i feel
about the same as i did yesterday
even even with climate change
and now of course um
just for clarity because whenever you
talk about this you have to you have to
tell people your own bias
my bias at the moment is that
climate change is a real thing which we
need to worry about
but that economically and
technologically we'll
we'll take care of it yeah it's a i'd
call it a challenge
that is well within the ability of
humans to work out and probably the
economic
destruction is over overstated so i'm
not terribly worried about climate
change even if
everything that is said about it is real
so if nothing that's said about it is
real i'm not worried
but also if everything that's said by
the experts about climate change is real
i'm also not worried because by their
own estimates they've shown that the
economic impact
is kind of trivial you won't even notice
now the way it's reported is
that there's a giant disaster and we can
predict it in the future
but the actual thing they did predict is
an amount of economic damage that you
wouldn't even notice
50 years from now it'd be so small so
that's
so that's our big problem and i'm not
even sure i have to worry about it
um the other one is that uh our big
problem is that white supremacist
terrorism in this country is that real
is there real white supremacist
terrorism probably i mean
everybody gets to define their own way
but let's say yes
how big is it how big is that problem
it feels like it's really really small
doesn't it like you could you could have
a
number of individual tragedies which i
wouldn't take away from the
the the horrificness of them
but if you added them all up at the end
of the year
it's still going to be our smallest
problem as horrible as it is
like uh mentally as horrible as the
the idea of it is if you add it all
together it's
kind of nothing um how about uh
war are we gonna go to war with iran
anytime soon
doesn't look like it north korea nope
russia nope china crazy
nope we don't even have a war
we're apparently we're going to leave
afghanistan and give it back to the
terrorists or whatever
but i'm not sure we care
do we do we care if afghanistan goes
back to the hell hole it was from the
hell hole it is
it's just a different kind of hellhole
and i'm not sure it matters
um then somebody's saying what about all
the
shootings and murders and the uprise and
crime
in the inner cities well let me ask you
this
is it a problem if you wanted it to
happen because the cities
seem to have made a choice the people
who have stated in the cities have made
a choice
that they're living in a world that's
closer to the way they want it to be
fewer police fewer police activities
maybe fewer police you know accidental
killings
but the price is a lot more murder
that's sort of what people wanted
if you say you want to defund the police
and you're a democrat
you're kind of getting what you want so
for me to say that's a big
problem that you're getting what you
wanted
i don't know how you define that as a
problem getting what you wanted
um you know of course it's a problem if
you're the one who gets killed
here's a question for you you know this
arizona audit is happening
and there have been lots of criticisms
that the people auditing it
are not experienced and it's going to be
sloppy and
haphazard and all other criticisms but
if it's true that it's a sloppy scrappy
uh inexperienced amateurish operation
what is one thing that would have
happened by now
if they had found irregularities
in the in the early stage and they would
have right
if they're going to find enough
irregularities in the whole audit and we
don't know that to be true
but if that's going to happen don't you
think that already
you would know that it's heading in that
direction
as in we've already found enough that if
this ratio holds for the rest of them
you got big problems right
do you think that this haphazard
according to the critics i don't know
how haphazard it is
there's an immaturist job do you think
all the people involved with that
you don't think that they know if
they've found something yet
of course they know of course the people
working on it know if they found
anything
and they know if they found enough that
if
if this ratio held it would look bad at
the end
how come you haven't heard anything
every day that goes by when you don't
hear that the
arizona audit found problems
the odds that there are problems shrinks
i would say on day one you could say to
yourself before anybody's looked at
anything
in the audit you say to yourself okay
what are the odds
that they're going to find something and
let's say just
you didn't know so you just said ah 50
50.
let's say that was your starting point i
don't know but i'm going to say
the world we live in there's a 50 chance
that's day one every day that they
continue auditing toward the end
and you don't hear about any big
problems that they've already found
now i get that they would try to save it
all for the end
i get that it would be their intention
to not leak anything until the end but
there's no way that happens in the real
world right
if the organizers had already found
things
knowing that the criticism is coming in
what would the organizers say
in public if they knew that they had the
goods
now they might not want to tell you what
the outcome is but the organizers would
say
something like this we've found some
things that are surprising
and we think you'll be shocked when you
see the outcome
right they wouldn't have to give you the
final answer
but they would definitely be hinting
that they're finding stuff
this dog is really loudly not barking
which if you had to make a bet right now
you should bet against
them finding anything that would reverse
the election result
somebody says there are mda agreements
would anybody like to explain to whoever
said their
nda agreements non-disclosure arguments
would anybody like to
explain how the real world works and
mdas don't have any
real power and certainly people will
still tell their spouse they're still
going to tell their friends
friends are going to talk even the
leader would want to tell the story if
they're seeing something early
so now i think that the odds of arizona
doing anything coming up with anything
credible that reverses the outcome
probably started around 50 chance
in people's minds anyway if not reality
and
it's probably down to closer to 10
now not impossible but i would say the
odds that arizona will be this big
shocking thing that changes our mind
about the world
yeah 10 that's my guess but maybe
and by the way somebody says will you
eat your hat
well keep in mind that my prediction
about elections in general
not about this election in particular
but about any system which can be
corrupted
is that there's a hundred percent chance
that it will be if there's a big payoff
for doing it and there is
with the only thing you don't know is if
it's happened yet
there's no question that it does happen
sometime over the
over the life cycle of this opportunity
for mischief
it'll happen definitely you just don't
know if it's happened
yet that's the only thing that's in
question
so no i don't i don't have an assumption
about whether arizona will turn up
any any kind of irregularities but i
think
maybe it's like 10 chance at this point
um ian
martizus i hope i i always
ian i don't know if i ever pronounce
your name correctly but let's say that's
close
ian martizus did a study uh in which he
checked the the neutralizing antibodies
for people who had the following
conditions they either got
one of the major vaccines
pfizer moderna johnson johnson or
or instead they had actually been
infected
and now they have antibodies from that
and what did you think
it came out now of course any study like
this would have to be
repeated and you know peer reviewed to
get
you know and ideally you want to
randomized and controlled and everything
so we're not we're not kidding ourselves
that this kind of a trial would be a
final answer to anything
but it's real provocative you know if if
this were
if this were duplicated and these
results did hold
it would find that and again this is the
big f
it would find that the two shot vaccines
the moderna and pfizer give you like
really high
protection and it stays a long time it's
like the best you can do
way below that is natural immunity
way below it let me say that again
natural immunity doesn't come close
to the immunity you get from the
two-shot regiment
but natural immunity does come kind of
close
to the one-shot johnson johnson now
the problem of course is that it might
be that every one of these
conditions lowers your risk of dying to
effectively zero
right i haven't heard of people getting
the coronavirus for a second time
and then dying after the second
infection
do we have even one example of that
because i think even the johnson johnson
reduces the risk of dying to
effectively zero right am i right on
that
do me a fact check on that so if you're
talking about dying they're probably all
just about
equally good in terms of they reduce
your
risk of dying to something closer to
zero
yeah i know there's the cytokines
uh storm and all that but it seems to me
that if you've recovered from one
infection your odds of dying from a
second one
unless something happened in the
meantime to give you another comorbidity
it feels like it's vanishingly small
because first of all you've proven that
you can recover from this exact
virus so why would you not recover the
second time
unless something had happened all right
so i think this is
not only really really useful
information
but ian is an incredible
data visualizer guy in addition to his
other talents in his talent stack
so you're going to see one of the best
graphs you've ever seen and i hate to
get excited about a graph
you know that is the wonkiest thing you
could ever do but when you see
a data visualization that's this good
you know just the way it's presented
visually it's freaking
thrilling it really is to see something
done so well so just look at the graph
if nothing else
to see how well you can explain
something visually if you if you really
know how to do this stuff
the difference between the people who
are the best in the world at it
and ian would be one of those and people
who are just kind of good at it it's
it's like michael jordan versus a you
know high school basketball player
they both play basketball but not really
you know what i mean so i guess joe
biden
is saying that he's not yet committed to
k-12 schools reopening full-time because
the coronavirus
remains unpredictable say his staff
but as mark hemingway just pointed out
on twitter we have lots of data from
private schools
so there have been enough private
schools open the whole time
that we should know exactly what the
risk is by now
and the risk doesn't look very high so
the assumption is that maybe teachers
unions are influencing biden
and just just think about how bad that
is
that teachers unions are influencing
biden
and this point is going to come back
come back
on another topic when i get to it but
just think about that
the biden is keeping people out of
schools
probably the data doesn't support it but
it's because of the teachers unions
who as you know are the source of all
well most of systemic racism in this
country
um there's another
you know i've been predicting this
forever and i know you think it's the
the worst prediction i've ever made and
i know you're gonna say
well okay you got lucky in a few things
but there's no way you're right about
this one
but i swear to god i think i'm right
about this
i think black americans are going to
turn republican
and the reason is just it's obvious
look at for example the trust of
vaccines
do you know that the black americans are
almost the same
as republicans when it comes to whether
or not they're going to get the
vaccination
very similar thinking about religion
very similar right very religious
republicans
um and although you don't see enough of
this in the news
pro law and order you know the black
population and the republican population
fairly pro-law order and
i haven't seen data on this but probably
pro second amendment
there's just a lot they have in common
you know and they
they just have to figure it out because
certainly um
let me ask you this if you could imagine
a random group
of black americans sorted into democrats
and republicans
so one group is just black american
republicans and the other is black
american democrats
which ones are making more money
which ones have found ways to overcome
what is inevitably racism it always
exists
but which ones have just completely
overcome it you know in terms of
a practical sense it's still always
there but
overcome it yeah the republicans every
time it's because the republican
way of approaching things doesn't just
work
but it works for the people around you
which is the big deal right
it doesn't just work for the person
doing it stay in school
stay off drugs you know have a religion
it's helpful in a lot of ways
i'm not religious but it helps in a lot
of ways
there's like a little republican formula
that if you're black
and you follow that formula your odds of
success
are really close to 100 percent and i
don't think that would be true for
anybody else
any other group so i i think the logic
of it
if the if the media were not
brainwashing people so effectively
i think this would just happen on its
own because there's a commonality there
that
is pretty strong all right
um the best coolest news today
and finally something i can sink my
teeth into and get a little interested
in
joel reported on this in
breitbart
and i had missed it but it's kind of a
big deal so when
tim scott said in his response to the
state of the union
he said that america is not a racist
country
well you can imagine how that went over
right because
on social media and all the pundits said
what are you talking about
of course it's a racist country we got
we got
racists here you know we're not talking
about every person being racist of
course nobody said that
but there are lots of racists lots of
racism
and there's lots of systemic racism and
it's all over
place and how could tim scott say we're
not a racist country when all the
evidence says yes
but here's the fun part
how many times have i told you how
clever it was that black lives matter
came up with that slogan black lives
matter
because if you try to expand it
to all lives matter you became branded a
racist
and so it became this really powerful
linguistic little package
that that punched you know much higher
than its
weight class so persuasion-wise the
phrase black lives matter
a plus genius did did what it was
supposed to do
maybe better than even the people who
came up with it thought it would do
but when tim scott said america is not
racist
he created and i don't know how much was
intentional
but he created the same kind of trap
because what happened next kamala harris
and joe biden will be asked the question
is america a racist country
do you see the beauty of this yet what
can they say
so you put the pres let's just take
biden as my example you put the
president of the united states
in this awkward little box where he has
to either
insult his own country for being racist
which you can't say in front of china
can you
can joe biden say united states is a
racist country
while china is listening he can't
he can believe it he can say it
privately
but if you're the president of the
united states you can't brand your own
country racist
when china is putting uyghurs in in you
know these training facilities right
because our our statements about other
countries only carry weight if we're not
likable
the moment he admitted oh yeah we're a
racist country
and he says hey china stop putting
uyghurs in
these camps what does china say
china obviously is going to say
no one wonders
why my front door would be
rigging here if you don't mind i'm gonna
look at my security camera for a second
looks like somebody's delivering
something
don't know what okay um
sorry about that it's too far away i
can't do that now
so so joe biden had to say
in response to is america racist country
he had to give an answer and here's the
answer he gave on the
nbc today show he said quote no i don't
think american people
are racist what
i thought there was a big problem with
white supremacy
but he says the american people he
doesn't believe they're racist
but he says but i think after 400 years
african americans have been left in a
position
where they're so far behind the eight
ball in terms of education health in
terms of opportunity
i don't think america is racist now he's
changed a little bit
so he started he started with the
american people are not racist
and then he went further and said i
don't think america as a country is
racist
but he said but i think the overhang
from all the jim crow and before that
slavery had a cost and we have to deal
with it
well that kind of just destroys the
entire democrat
philosophy doesn't it did did joe biden
not
just become a republican because
isn't the republican opinion
that we're not a racist country as
tim scott said but that yes everybody
understands that uh black americans have
not
uh you know have not made the same
progress as other people
and and they would be good if they did
it's it's starting to look really
republican
isn't it and i'm thinking to myself
is this going to become like the new
thing you know you always wonder what's
going to be the thing that the news
latches onto
but making joe biden answer this
question over and over again about
are we really racist it's going to be
hard for him to explain
why he ran for office because he
believed the fine people hoax
if you believed the fine people hoax
that the president had called
you know the the racist fine people um
then maybe you do think it's a racist
country and there's a much bigger
problem here
but he's got some explaining to do i
think he he just through the entire
democratic
idea that everything is victimhood and
we've got to fix it
under the bus but i also wonder what
obligation does the country have
to fix a problem where there's a group
of people who are
starting from behind
what is the philosophical
what is the backing for helping people
because they started from behind now i
guess in this theory
that the starting from behind was caused
by
uh you know the white people who are the
slavers
but again you have the comparison
problem don't you
because the even the slavers
it's not like they took wealth away from
the slaves because the slaves didn't
have any wealth
you know even before they were slaves
and
it's not like they denied them the
education that they were getting before
so the proper comparison would be
the descendants of black people in this
country and how are they doing
on average economically compared to the
descendants of the people who were left
behind
in africa and you know how are they
doing economically
that's the comparison so if the people
who are left behind in africa
are doing far worse and i actually i
don't know how that would come out
but if they are then you could say that
the
the descendants of slaveries came out
ahead
they just didn't come out nearly as they
had as other people
but is that a cause for
uh for fixing it because you could argue
that no matter how bad the actions were
and of course
you know slavery is sort of the ultimate
sin right
no matter how bad that is let's call it
the ultimate sin
it's just sort of a truth that even bad
things
can produce some good outcomes even
horrible things
can accidentally produce some good
outcomes and one of those good outcomes
is i'm guessing
that the average black american is way
better off
than if their ancestors had never been
in america in the first place under any
situation
i'm guessing but if we don't know the
answer that it's hard to figure out
how to fix it all right you heard on
project veritas when they had the
undercover
video that uh the climate was going to
be the next topic
that cnn was going to start pushing
because they need something big and
scary so
they're talking so again of course just
like project veritas
told us was coming cnn's got a story
today about the glaciers are melting
faster than predicted
so on one hand you've got cnn pushing
climate
fear at the same time
we've learned that climate change and
the fear of it
is causing a lot of mental health
problems especially for young people
like a lot of them like seriously
a lot of really bad mental health
problems
and it's because young people don't know
that the media is illegitimate
if you're my age you know that them
saying that there's a
bad thing coming means there might be
but probably not because the news is
just not legitimate
and if you're young imagine how scary it
would be being told that
uh you know the you're going to burn up
in the planet will be
uninhabitable sometime in your middle
ages now when i was a kid
we believed that the odds of a nuclear
war
with the soviet union was closer to
probable
than improbable so i grew up
sort of with ptsd that a nuclear weapon
was going to detonate any moment and i
would be
killed or or maimed by it and
i don't know if that had a toll on me
but i feel like it did
i feel like worrying about blowing up in
a nuclear blast
probably affected my childhood somehow
don't you think and i would definitely
believe
that climate change panic is causing a
lot of mental illness
so remember i told you the cnn creates
the problem
and then reports on it here's another
one
the more of these you see the more
obvious it becomes because it's
invisible
until until you see examples
cnn scared the crap out of the public
and and people in their business scared
the crap out of the public
probably scared them beyond what is
reasonable
now they may have had good intentions to
you know to get something going
but the effect of it is that the news
business
caused this massive mental illness and
then they turned it into a story
about how climate change is causing the
mental illness
but is that what happened no
climate change didn't cause anybody's
mental illness
the news is reporting on it and the way
they frame it
caused the mental illness not the
warming
because you walk outside and it's kind
of the same as yesterday
there's literally nobody who is actually
mentally affected
by actual climate change none
because we don't feel it right even
today's
scary story about the glaciers melting
fastener
says they've added a quarter inch to the
sea level
did you could you tell the difference no
right so this is a fake story
in the sense that i'm not saying that
climate change is fake i'm saying that
the fear of it is caused by the media
and then the media blames it on climate
change
it was never climate change it was the
media they're the ones who
caused the mental health problem that's
it that's the whole story
now climate change itself might be bad
but that's separate there's a
story here about uh a new way to weed
uh to weed your crops with lasers
how much do you love that how much do
you love that now there's a big truck
that drives over your crops and it uses
some kind of
plant recognition to know the difference
between a plant and a weed
and as it's driving off over the weeds
and plants
it fires lasers into the weeds
only the weeds
how cool is that because apparently it
removes the need for
a lot of chemicals and pesticides and
stuff
that's pretty cool isn't it
now you may you you may have
known this technology was coming because
you can go to your local grocer
not grocery store your local pharmacy
and you can buy a little device that
does exactly the same thing for the hair
on your body
have you seen those so it's a little
device
let's say you've got a little back air
you're a guy you want to get rid of some
back hair
you just run this over your back and it
senses the difference between a hair
and and just back it actually shoots a
little laser
into the hair now i have used this
product
and it's like a little uh feels like a
little
maybe snap of a rubber band or something
uh
yeah so you can remove your hair with
one of these cheap devices
so putting the same technology into um
into farming just made sense if you knew
about that other device
you would have seen that coming there's
news today that i think is fake news
about an iranian prison swap
in which allegedly the u.s and iran
would swap some prisoners
and then allegedly and i think this is
the fake part
there would be some you know large
amount of money that we would give to
iran as part of this deal
now uh the administration is denying it
but not denying that they're having
conversations about prisoners
which apparently is not that big a deal
colin says counterpoint here in alaska
we get far less snow in our ski resorts
as a result
of an increase of temperature of a
couple degrees
well i'm just saying
that you probably don't have a mental
health problem
because your ski slope doesn't have
enough snow
i mean unless you work there i suppose
but
i'm not saying that climate change isn't
happening i'm just saying that
for most of us we wake up we go through
our day and it's not really affecting us
and i don't think you can know for sure
that climate change is changing what's
happening at your ski slope
but maybe i don't rule it down either
all right
so i don't think this iranian prison
swap story is real
in terms of the money part and the
reason is i don't believe
biden would be so dumb as to
do the same thing that caused
conservatives
to talk about the pallets of cash
forever
you know everybody knows the story obama
giving iran
ballots of cash to make the nuclear deal
and then and then things didn't go well
so i'm going to call fake news on that i
don't think there'll be a
dollar amount considered here's some
more fake news in my opinions
but this is sort of marginal fake news
you've all heard the story that warren
buffett
who's worth over 100 billion dollars
has lived in the same house in omaha
since 1958
and if you google it you'll find all
kinds of stories confirming it
and uh when i when i mentioned some
skepticism about it
um people who live in omaha said oh yeah
he's
yeah he's cited in omaha on a regular
basis
going to just local eateries and so yes
warren buffett does in fact live in the
same little house he bought in 1958
well does he does he
let me add this skepticism
number one you always see the picture of
the house and it looks kind of modest
you know it's a it's a sizable house
but it looks modest for a billionaire
but then you see it from
the air it turns out that modest part
is just what you can see from the street
turns out
it's not nearly as modest as it used to
be
because they're they're extra
construction that you can't see
so it's bigger than it looks and we
don't know what was added
so it's certainly not the same house he
bought in 1958
so let's let's remove the idea that it's
the same house
it might be the same land and it might
look
the same from the street but there's a
lot of extra stuff going on back there
that we don't have any details about but
beyond that
do you think he lives in that house in
omaha really
here's what i think and i'm just going
to guess if he really lived in that
house
we probably would have heard something
like this
he spends at least 200 nights a year in
his house but he travels a lot too
or something along those lines
and
so i think he probably travels and stays
at luxury
places as he travels but when he does
his omaha
thing where he does his annual meeting
he probably does stay at the house it
probably is his
official residence he probably does
visit there often
but i don't think he lives there
my if i had to guess do you think he
spends
more more time sleeping not
in that house than he spends in the
house what do you think
i'm going to guess that while he
probably does use it as a home base
that where he actually spends his time
probably in more of a luxurious
setting that's you know temporary or
rented
or his private plane or whatever
all right yeah i see a lot of you
disagreeing because you want to believe
that he really just has a modest little
house but i'm going to say
without knowing any of the facts i think
that he does not
sleep there most of the time but if i'm
wrong about that
i'd be amazed but i could be wrong
um there's a weird thing happening in
fashion and
celebrity news which is
and i'm trying to figure out how to say
this without getting canceled
because i'm going to talk about like
it's interesting i'm trying not to
insult anybody right
so the the concept which i'm going to
talk about
is not intended as anybody's insult
but it wasn't that long ago when the
celebrity news
would show impossibly beautiful people
usually female
and we the normal unwashed masses would
look at them and we'd say
my god like how can anybody be that
fit and beautiful and it looks like you
can't even
the the dimensions that looks like a
barbie
you know is it is it just some kind of
is it all plastic surgery like how is it
even
possible but uh
i don't know if it's culture or the
pandemic that changed it
but that reporting has changed to
the same literally in some cases the
same people
who were photographed by the paparazzis
like looking beautiful
and here's somebody caught in a bikini
and don't they look incredible
it's kind of turned into frumpy people
dressed casually who definitely have a
few extra pounds
but are still celebrities and here's the
the funny part
the text that talks about the
celebrities
hasn't changed but the celebrities
definitely changed
they don't look the same as they did a
year ago and so
so it used to be to be like an
impossibly attractive looking person
and then the text would be blah blah
blah is showing off their fit and toned
body
you know making everybody jealous at the
beach or something like that
right so the text of the picture totally
matched
now that now the picture will be
somebody who's 40 pounds overweight
and the text will say so and so is
showing off their toned abs
and i'm thinking no
again i'm not i'm not fat shaming that's
not the point of this
the point is that now the text is
completely out of touch with the picture
they just don't match anymore and
they've started to do lots of
uh sexy pictures of senior
citizens have you seen that so sharon
stone
who was in her 60s whatever has been
appearing in all these semi-sexy
pictures of
here's sharon stone in her 60s showing
off her bikini
body and or not bikini but
you know showing off her legs and stuff
so the celebrity
photography business has just took a
really weird turn
and then the ultimate was you do you all
know
billy eilish so billy eilish a woman who
a very successful singer and
most famous for dressing the least
like a beautiful person that you
possibly could
like she she went as far as you could in
the looking like she wasn't trying you
know to
just wearing you know frumpy stuff and
whatever and apparently she got talked
into
or decided to or whatever to show a more
revealing look of herself on the cover
of british vogue
and i don't want to be unkind
but she didn't quite pull it off if you
know what i mean
uh and then again i'm not trying to be
unkind and that that's not the point
the point is not about the person so
this is nothing about the person
you know if she wants to get more
healthy and
whatever i'm all for it has nothing to
do with the person
but the way the media is treating this
is just weird
they're just showing people not
attractive and talking
about them as if they're just the way
they used to look
it's when you see it it's crazy
the the the the british publication
daily mail
is the one that's the most hilarious
it's the whole the whole right side is
all these pictures of celebrities
and most of them are like somebody
looking great
somebody showed off their body and you
click on me like
they look kind of normal to me they
don't look like
superhuman like they used to
so that's different and
um i think that is all i wanted to say
ta-da so
are any of you feeling anxious or
depressed about
climate change go how many of you
feel that you lose sleep or that you're
super worried about the future because
of climate change
and i'll bet you almost nobody
because i knowing my audience most of
you lean
conservative even though i don't and
i'm sort of all over the map but yeah
conservatives just aren't worried now
don't you think that's an advantage of
not being susceptible to fake news
i think that's an advantage being
conservative
makes you more mentally fit so now we
have
two points uh
three really i would say we have at
least
three data points that show that being a
liberal gives you brain damage
so the first one was the show that we
learned that looking at only one kind of
the news
either only cnn or only fox news
if you only looked at one you would get
brain damage because you'd start to
believe that one narrative
was true and it would distort your
ability to
sort out reality so since we know that
conservatives are always exposed to the
news on the left
but then they also watch their own
conservative news
they don't have this problem presumably
because they're seeing the whole picture
they're just preferring some news
the other people are only seeing
selected news so they're actually
technically brain damaged according to
science
now we see this climate change is
causing massive mental illness
that as you can see in the comments
doesn't affect conservatives
because they're just not that worried so
now you have two
fairly well confirmed i would say
credible
statements that being liberal causes
brain damage then i would add to that
the fear of the police for example the
the fear of being killed by the police
let's say if you're african-american how
afraid should you be
of actually being killed by the police
well if you looked at the news you'd be
plenty scared
and you probably your own experience
would be negative as well
but if you looked at it statistically
statistically what are your odds what
are the what are the odds of being
killed by the police
if you're not resisting arrest or you're
unarmed that's pretty small
but i'm pretty sure that there are a lot
of people who literally have some
form of ptsd because they're afraid of
the police
afraid of getting killed by the police
so i think we have at least
three fairly obvious situations
in which the predicted outcome is that
people on the left would have something
like literally brain damage
again not an insult just a description
of you know these forces cause these
things to happen
and they're those forces are not
operating on
republicans but the forces are
definitely operating
on other people suppose you're a woman
and you believe that women got paid 72
cents on a dollar
which is what democrats largely believe
how would you feel about going to work
how would you feel about living in the
world where you believe you paid you get
paid 72 cents in a dollar for the same
work
probably pretty bad i would think that
would have an effect on your mental
health
but conservatives know that the
statistic isn't real
so they don't worry about it because
it's it's fake
conservatives weren't worried about the
um so much
about the charlottesville fine people
thing because they didn't think it was
real
we weren't worried about um russiagate
and russia collusion didn't think it was
real
it wasn't so i've got a feeling that
conservatives are where all the good
mental health is happening
and that is my show for the day and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
