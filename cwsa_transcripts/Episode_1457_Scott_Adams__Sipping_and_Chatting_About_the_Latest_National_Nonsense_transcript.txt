hello everybody
a little bit behind here
god damn it my technology is bad sorry
didn't mean to swear but
jesus
tell you my new ipad situation
it's a disaster so far
and i'll be with you in a moment all
right
everybody good
all right
um here we are
and i'm pretty sure that the technology
is working i'll tell you what problem i
have i bought two identical ipads
so that they're brand new and they have
the latest operating system and
everything be good
except
one of the new ones doesn't work for
youtube
or twitter
the the apps just crash they're all
they're all brand new updated brand new
ipad latest operating system and they
can't do youtube
they can't do twitter
but it's identical cousin does both of
them fine
i also can't reboot it it looks like
they changed how you uh reboot the new
ones
if anybody knows how to reboot a ipad it
doesn't doesn't involve holding down the
power i found this on the web shut up
 thing if you're not going to
work don't talk to me christ just go
over there and shut up
all right
how would you like to enjoy a little
thing i call the simultaneous hip
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass a tanker chelsea stein that can't
eat a jug of glass a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine here of the day the thing
that makes everything better is called
the simultaneous sip and watch it go now
go
so i'm a little bit late this morning
because
i was compiling
an amazing tweet
and i was just done
and i'll read it to you and then i'll
hit send
i said as far as i know no city state or
country on the planet
has beaten coveted
with ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
lots of places have limited access to
vaccines
whereas ivermectin and hydroxycolic
green are widely available
so how does your worldview explain that
so i'm not saying it works or it doesn't
work you get banned from social media if
you take
any kind of a positive take on those
things
so here's the question
your world view says that they those two
things let's see many of you
not all of you but for many of you your
world view
is that those things work
why have they not worked anywhere on
earth
do you ever think about that
it doesn't work anywhere on earth
not one place has made that work
but according to the studies
those things work great right
so you think that the people who didn't
have access to vaccines would be
sucking that stuff up and would have
cured their problems
like crazy or
or
is it possible
somebody in the comments says mcafee
died and now we have a new virus
coincidence
maybe
so
just check your world view
um
if you are a subscriber to locals
and many of them are watching me right
now what you learned in the last few
days
where you learned my
framework and
technique for creativity
which you couldn't learn any other way
you'd have to be on the locals platform
and you also saw my
explanation of my live streaming setup
that i've taken
years to perfect and if my ipad worked
it would be in good shape
so that's why you missed just this week
and there'll be a lot more
um here's a little uh interesting thing
apparently the favorability of nuclear
power has reached a all-time high
how do you like that
favorability of nuclear power at an
all-time high and
that
that uptick in popularity happened in
the last four or five years
and especially in the last couple
it looks like the biggest change
happened after trump left office
because i think there was just an
automatic resistance
to nuclear power if it had a republican
connection but as soon as you get biden
in in office
i think the democrats just said well if
we're serious about climate change i
guess we better be serious about nuclear
power because it's the only way to
probably the only way to get there
although there have been some good
advances in
batteries and stuff but we haven't quite
seen them actualized but here's my
question
i've told you before
that
i have this weird track record that when
i'm
trying to persuade on any national
topic
if you looked at the graph of people's
opinions you would find the point that i
entered and you see a sharp change in
the curve
that happened for example when i started
persuading years ago on
the right to die you know the uh the
ability to have a doctor-assisted death
and
if you look at the gallup poll
you see that that trend was like uh and
then i wrote a viral
piece in favor of that right and you can
see that just at the time i did that
viral piece which went just about
everywhere i mean it really
it actually made a big impact and you
can see that the curve just went room
and changed now
is that because
i was persuaded
there's no reason to believe that
because curves change right things
change
but
there's this weird coincidence that
whenever i enter a fight
persuasion-wise
the curve just changes in my direction
pretty much every time i can't think of
an exception but i think it's probably
easier to explain it in terms of
me joining causes that i know i'll win
or that they were going to go in that
direction anyway
so i'm going to say it's less about
cause and effect
and more about knowing what things need
to happen and just sort of
joining the parade that's already moving
i think that's a better explanation of
what we're seeing
all right but if you'd like to believe
that i caused those things to happen
that's great too it's just
there's no evidence for that
uh bannon on his war room had a he
continues to be the most interesting
content on the internet
am i wrong
you know whether it's
true stuff or fake stuff or
i never know what's true and what's not
but bannon's war room is he just has the
most interesting stuff i just never know
if it's true right true in terms of
whether the
guests are credible or not but here's
another one
um he had a
gentleman on who i guess has some
experience in military intelligence
and apparently this fellow can look at
uh demographics
and registration
so demographic trends and registration
trends in the country
and he can determine if your vote
looks like it was fraudulent or not
so if there are more votes for a
candidate
than either the democratic change in the
four years since the last vote or
the number of registered voters
uh is out of whack there's just too many
votes for this situation
then he says that's a sign
that maybe not always but maybe might
indicate fraud now you say to yourself
how likely is that model to work
do you think that that really can
capture all that because remember the
trump election is different than any
other election because he was a
different character i'm not sure people
acted the same and then you had the
pandemic you know throws all the rules
out
but
apparently he predicted correctly all 50
states in 2016
including florida
all 50.
that's right his model
got all 50 states right he claims it
seems like that would be something you
could check
but if you really got all 50 stays right
and he's using the same model
then the only thing that could be
different is the pandemic
because it was trump both times right
you know so he would think that he'd
have a handle on it but i think the
pandemic did change enough because the
way people voted changed so i'm not sure
the model works
so i'm going to say that
i think that the pandemic and then the
legal changes to voting and all the
mail-in and stuff
i don't know that any model still works
from 2016 to 2020.
but it's out there so that's some
information
so i did a unscientific poll and i asked
what's a bigger problem for you at the
moment is the bigger problem for you
personally
the virus
or the policies about the virus
what happened of course
as you might imagine something like
89 said that the government's policies
are the problems
89
it's not even close
now of course this is a deeply
unscientific poll
but do you think you would get a
different result anywhere else
you know if i
i mean obviously my audience leans
conservative even even though i'm not
but
i feel like it would be a vast majority
of people would say that the government
restrictions are the problem for them
personally
you know we've all been
sort of hypnotized into thinking
that what you do with the pandemic is
more about the collective
it's not so much about your your
personal what's good for you but if 90
of the country-ish
uh or anything over 75 i suppose
thinks that the bigger problem is the
government than the virus
i think that has to inform your
policy making right
but i'm not sure it is
so
rasmussen did a poll they said did joe
biden win fairly in 2020 what do you
think people said well 36 percent of the
country still says
no
36 percent of the country
thinks we didn't have a fair election
that's a lot
how do you have a democracy
that stays intact when 36 of the people
think that something happened
but
here's the good news or is it depends on
your point of view
apparently that number is lower than it
was just a few months ago or june
actually it was uh 41
in june but it's trended down a little
bit now that makes sense right the
longer you go we're there on to proof of
some massive fraud
the less likely you're going to find it
i would say
now
that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
i'm just saying that if the audits were
going to produce something that would
change all our minds i know we'd know by
now even though they haven't released it
officially we'd kind of know by now
so i'm not expecting that to happen but
how do you live in a world where so many
people think they don't even live in a
system that's fair maybe that's always
been the case
uh yeah maybe it's always been the case
that
somebody's pointing out you have to
subtract out the 25 who are wrong about
everything
no matter what the poll is
25
ish we'll just be wrong about everything
and i'm not even sure we should poll
dumb people anymore
there should be some
minimum level of paying attention and
intelligence before you're even included
in a poll because do we need to know
what dumb people think i guess we do
because they make a lot of decisions
all right uh
jack passabek got things
interesting on twitter today
with this tweet he said literally every
movie is better than the last jedi
it's one of those provocative kind of
tweets he's good at doing i get a lot of
comments
but i'd like to add to that
black widow
if you've tried to watch the movie black
widow that just came out on streaming oh
my god it's terrible
it's just it's just
it just makes you feel bad
i'm watching this thing and i think wait
a minute
i thought i was signing up for something
in the
entertainment realm
as opposed to something that's going to
cause me ptsd
one of them makes you happy it's called
entertainment the other one gives you
mental illness
opposite of entertainment
black widow
if you've got any mental illness it's
going to exacerbate that because
it's terrible it just makes you feel
depressed and dark and
now here's the bigger point
when was the last time you saw a good
movie
it's like they don't exist part of the
problem is our uh
our attention spans have shrunk and was
it uh who was it mark wahlberg no it was
a
good will hunting
what's the name of the
blonder guy matt damon yeah matt damon
was just saying publicly that he doesn't
think his children will watch movies
he doesn't think his children
will watch movies like the industry will
just disappear
is he right
yeah i think he might be
i don't think it'll disappear it'll be
like radio you know when television came
in it'll transform in some way so i
think it'll be around
but the the idea of sitting there for
three hours watching uh something that
gives you ptsd just to make you a little
happier at the end
i just don't know that anybody wants
that anymore
the the whole idea of anybody watching
anything at the same time doesn't make
sense
have you ever done this i think i've
mentioned this before so when i built my
house
20 let's say uh
2008 or so i was doing the planning
and back then
it was just a given that if you if you
were building a you know high-end house
you would put a theater in there
because that would be all your movie
nights you know you'd have your friends
over and
you'd have a couple of martinis and
you'd sit down you'd watch this great
movie and it'd be sort of something to
build a
build an evening around
when was the last time you tried to get
anybody to watch the same movie at the
same time
it's really impossible now because
people have either already seen it as
soon as it came out you know they
streamed it or whatever
or they don't want to watch it
or they'll talk during it because they
said yes but they're not really
interested in it
just that the whole idea of putting
people in a room and watching a movie it
just isn't a thing anymore we're all
watching our own content on our phones
and we're much happier about it so i
think movies are going away now here's
the interesting part
you were probably waiting for me to get
to the interesting part is there an
interesting part about this
yes
you might be aware that the cia
has used the movie industry for years
to brainwash the public
to make you more patriotic for example
or to have whatever
whatever traits the government thought
you should have you know maybe more
family oriented and
blotted blah blah
but what happens if movies go away
because movies were the dominant way in
which and tv shows and i think the
argument is going to apply to both of
these domains
but tv shows and movies were how
the government created a culture
they told you what to act like
and then they showed you in movies and
then you just grew up thinking well i
guess i act like that
because we you know we just imitate
things
what happens when
the programming interface for society
disappears
what good would your computer be if
there was no interface
the computer would still exist
but there wouldn't be any way to program
it
that's happening
the the interface for programming the
public into one
coherent culture
is dissolving
so what happens who ends up programming
citizens
school
right
school so in other words the teachers
unions become
the programmers of society they get the
young people
but what about the older people well
social media right in the comments
social media is the new programming
entity
but
here's the question
is the cia
manipulating social media
for the same purpose and in the same way
that they manipulated we know this now
this is a matter of fact it's not
speculation we know that they have
historically manipulated movies
and probably tv shows i think that's
confirmed
do you think that they're consciously
trying to program the public
through social media
now certainly they're they're involved
in specific questions you know maybe the
vaccines and
maybe something about a war or something
but do you think just generally they're
programming you to to know what kind of
a life to lead
because it doesn't look to me like
the cia is what's programming you
let me ask you this if the cia wanted to
program you to be a good citizen and
make the country coherent and like feel
like it had one dominant culture
would you see what you see on social
media now
no right it's the opposite of that
social media is ripping apart
the structure of america by by
emphasizing our differences that's what
it does best
so
although you can imagine that the cia
would move its influence and
brainwashing from movies and tv that are
collapsing
into social media that's the dominant
media
but it doesn't look like it's happening
to me
because it would look completely
different in other words social media
would be telling you to get a family and
you know be a be a nuclear family and
pay your taxes and
you know be be open-minded about stuff i
guess
but
uh somebody says ai is screwing us yeah
it could be that the social media
platforms are driven by ai
the movies were driven by human beings
behind the scenes
so i believe that we're being programmed
randomly
for the first time
meaning that there's not one dominant
program or interface that's programming
us as a culture
we're just taking inputs from everywhere
well what does that do
does that destroy the country
i feel like it might
like i don't feel like it's it's cause
and effect and it's obvious that that
would destroy the country
but it might
right
like i don't think you can rule it out
because if if the way we think
as a country you know our dominant
beliefs
if those get out of whack the whole
country falls apart there's nobody who
would doubt that right
that if if what you think about the
world
your world view if it gets all out of
whack the country falls apart
some would say that the best asset the
united states has ever had
is its narrative the narrative meaning
that the story of the united states
and if you if you're not citizen of the
united states you probably recognize
that too that i think the united states
becomes sort of a
you know at least one model that people
look at to say
you know do we want to be like that or
not
so we have a weird situation in which we
are
being randomly programmed for the first
time
what happens will there be a dominant
force that rises to program people
because the network tv seems to be doing
that but it's
separating the left from the right
which is all bad news
so i feel as if probably
some solution will
uh evolve
just because we need it
but i don't know what that will be
it's hard to say i don't know that it
will be influencers on the internet who
are especially good could be it could be
that people who are seen as independent
there are a few of them
might get a bigger audience and more
more influence
yeah i see in the comments that the usa
soccer team needs to be programmed or
brainwashed i guess with the american
story
and i think you're right you're right
that's a perfect example watching our
olympic athletes essentially ruin a
tradition
by turning it into something else
so you say i should reset my network
settings on my ipad well i would if i
could figure out even how to well i want
to reboot it first can anybody tell me
how to reboot an ipad a modern one
because it used to be you just hold the
power button but that seems to have
changed
all right
um here's some more stuff happening um i
saw a tweet from balaji sreenivasan who
you should follow by the way
follow balaji sreenivasan just trust me
when i give you recommendations of who
to follow on twitter
it's based on this
that if you follow me
you're almost certainly going to like
who i recommend because they're feeding
into my world view in a strong way and
one of them is bellagi so his first name
is spelled b-a-l-a
and just search for bellagio srinivasan
you'll find them anyway he tweeted today
that
and by the way his tweets would be on a
whole variety
of topics
but if you just want to see what one of
the smartest people on the planet
thinks about stuff
it's worth doing right because trust me
he's one of the smartest people like on
the whole freaking planet and he knows
more about more things
than just about anybody you know like
more domains than you you've ever seen
so just follow up he talks about today
in a tweet that china has made a drone
has made drone armies 10 times cheaper
and it's a trend to watch uh there's a
company avex i guess must be a chinese
company where their top-end drones run
for one to two million dollars a piece
now i'm not talking about you know the
little handheld drones that hobbyists
have i'm talking about the big flying
ones that look like an airplane and they
have missiles
for one to two million dollars
in other words i could afford one
right you know i'm rich enough i mean i
probably won't buy one
but i could buy a
a missile armed
chinese drone i can literally personally
afford it
what the hell is going to happen when
the rest of you can afford it
it's not going to be good
i think the cost of a uh a deadly drone
is going to be sub a thousand dollars
pretty sure sub a thousand dollars now
i'm not talking about the big
military-looking drones that are size of
an airplane i'm talking about the small
ones
and i wrote about this
a long time ago 20 years ago
as soon as you can get uh could i rent
it from you
that would be a good business i'll buy
one drone and just rent it down for a
hundred thousand a pop
it'll get a lot of customers you want to
kill your rival
borrow my drone
100 000 and you can take out anybody
anywhere
all right so
um yeah we're going to see uh
the swarms of small
drones that explode
when they reach a destination there's no
way that's not going to happen
let me give you some of my arguments
that my critics are making about me i
know you don't i do
let me be honest with you a little bit
the news is freaking boring isn't it
now i know that a lot of you have been
blaming me
for being less interested
less interesting lately
i cop to that
i'm totally less interesting but it's
because i most of my show is based on
the news and the news just without trump
i mean i suppose obama would be more
interesting
but biden just
there's nothing to talk about
so
i apologize
i expect that things will heat up
especially as we get into the uh
you know the the midterm elections and
stuff so there'll be fun things ahead
but
my subscribers on locals have started
bailing out because anytime i mention
vaccines and stuff you're like ah stop
talking about it but it's kind of the
only news
it's the only thing happening and so i'm
going to mention a little bit
but i'll try to keep it
tight
and here's some some topics you haven't
seen before all right
uh one of my critics or a lot of my
critics say
one of my problems is that i never
question the motives of government
that i assume too often that people have
good motivations
and that they're not trying to put one
over on you
does that sound accurate
those of you who watch me the most would
you say it is an accurate
uh criticism
that i'm too trusting of authority
i'm seeing people say it's accurate
but most people say it's no
now let me give you some background who
was the first public figure to tell you
that the cdc who and the surgeon general
were lying to you about masks and the
real reason was to keep you from
hoarding them who is the first public
figure and
that i'm aware of in the world to say
that it was me
it was me the very first thing i said
about the pandemic is all of your
authorities are lying to you
and
what do we know now completely right
we're completely right all of our
authorities were lying to it to us and
forth exactly the reason i told you
that i suspected they had another motive
and sure enough
all right who was one of there were a
few of us but who was one of the first
people who told you that our authorities
were up by not closing uh travel
to china sooner
who told you that they were making their
decisions for apparently political
reasons instead of medical reasons
me
right a week before trump said it
i said it very loudly screaming into the
live stream
that i didn't trust our
our authorities because they're making
decisions for apparently the wrong
reasons
some
some kind of
political considerations
all right so
uh and i don't think that there's been
any time when i've ever trusted either
the science
or the government
so anybody who thinks that's a valid
criticism of the most famous
skeptic of management
literally 30 years of experience
telling you that management is lying to
you that's what the dilbert comic is
is telling you that you can't trust
authority it's it's my brand
and my critics who say well you're a
little too trusting of authority scott
deep insight there
about uh
i've been promoting vaccinations
how many times do i have to tell you i
don't care if you get vaccinated
it's a personal decision your your risk
profile is not the same as mine that's
the other thing people say scott you
never mentioned that people have
different risk profiles no i mentioned
it every day
all right
um
how about
oh one one is that
i fail to recognize
the the things we learned by the sweden
model
and so somehow i alone
and the one person who doesn't
understand this sweden has taught us
something
let me teach you something
none of the countries tell us anything
none of them there's no country you can
look at and say oh look at their
experience
so now we know what to do what works and
what doesn't that doesn't exist
not sweden
not anywhere
we really don't know why any country is
doing anything we see them going up and
down independent of
policy
we don't know why anything is happening
so sweden is just one of the countries
that we don't understand why anything's
happening
that's it and that's your criticism your
criticism is that you don't understand
that one country is experienced doesn't
mean anything we can't tell anything
from it we think we can it's just an
illusion
and then this one somebody said on
youtube yesterday
scott spends nearly half of every
podcast directing attention to vaccines
well i mean that's everybody in the news
he doesn't try to persuade against
lockdowns or masked mandates is that
true
would you say that i don't try to
persuade against lockdowns the new ones
and i don't try to persuade
against uh mask mandates the mandate
part
is that true
well it may be that uh it's true in
terms of what i talk about the most but
that has more to do with what's more
interesting it's not what i'm trying to
it's not my world view it's just what's
more interesting at the moment so let me
say it directly
lockdowns look like a bad idea to me
is that clear enough
lockdowns now
and especially anything
stopping kids from going to school
it looks like a bad idea to me
is there any ambiguity in that
to me it looks like a really bad idea
and the reason is that when you get to
the point where everybody can have a
vaccine if they want it
it's just freedom
it's just a freedom question let me put
it in context
our uh we lose 480 000 people a year to
cigarette smoking that's how many people
die in the united states in one year
from cigarettes
four hundred and eighty thousand has
anybody ever complained about
cigarette smokers
hurting the capacity of emergency rooms
no because it's just built in
we just assume there'll be x number of
deaths per year
so you build a capacity that handles it
maybe
and it's looking like this is the case
we're in a permanent pandemic
meaning that people who don't want to
get vaccinated and even people who do
it's just going to be here forever or
the variant will or the next one will
get out of the lab we're just sort of in
a permanent pandemic
world so wouldn't it make more sense to
expand our hospital resources
so that we can handle the next pandemic
if not this one
better maybe we have some way to quickly
expand and contract so i think hospitals
are going to have to evolve until it's
just routine
i mean it might be routine surge like
they they know how to surge quickly for
capacity that might be the only routine
part but it's fine
that would work
right so
my opinion
is
open everything uh try to adjust the
hospitals as well as you can
you got freedom you got people dying but
it was their choices those are choices
so if you think i'm in favor of
lockdowns you're very wrong
i was in favor of lockdowns for two
weeks
the first time we tried it it was just
an experiment and i thought that the the
cost benefit
of at least finding out if it made a
difference was you know pretty favorable
but then we found that it didn't make
didn't make a difference so now we have
new information
uh and as far as mask mandates
again same problem
i don't think vaccinated people should
have masks
and because i'm vaccinated i don't care
if you wear a mask whether you're
vaccinated or not
so
could i be more clear that mask mandates
i not only do i resist but i actively
recommend you resist them
that that
my plan
is to go into places that require masks
assuming that that gets implemented
where i live hasn't happened yet looks
like it's close
but my plan is to not wear a mask
in any place that says you need a mask
and then i'm going to have them ask me
to leave
or ask me to put on a mask
and then i'm going to be polite
and i'm going to do as asked either
leave or put on a mask and i'm not going
to make a hard time for the employee
because it's not the employee's fault
i'm just going to make it a little bit
more friction
to do ordinary business that's all just
a little friction and if other people do
the same then i think the masked mandate
just falls apart
and it wouldn't take many of us maybe
ten percent of us would be able to take
because the employees would be spending
all their time
managing mask updates and mandates and
they don't want to do that they don't
have any authority they're going to get
in fights and they're not going to sell
as much i mean nothing good about it
so
is there anybody else who's telling you
to resist and actually violate the
guidelines
i'm telling you to violate the
guidelines directly in public
so
could that be more clear
does anybody have any questions i'm
telling you to violate the guidelines
i i can't be more clear than
that all right
apparently there's more pessimism on
solving kovid used to be wasn't long ago
in june
i guess 89
of people said the pandemic was you know
going in the right direction we were
getting out of it but now only 45 say
that
and i think that's the right thing
meaning that it makes sense that the
public doesn't think this is going to
end because at the moment
it doesn't look like it's ever going to
end does it it looks like we're in a
permademic
permanent pandemic
because if it's not this one it's the
next variant if it's not the next
variant it's the next virus
because this isn't the last
thing that's getting out of a lab right
does anybody think well i'm glad we
fixed that problem of viruses getting
out of labs
no no it's going to happen again we'll
have another probably lots of them
so
unfortunately we have to learn how to
live with that so it makes sense that
people are less optimistic but here's a
question i have
and this is a serious question
given that we know here are the things
we know that the vaccinations apparently
lose effectiveness a lot faster than we
thought
that's new information
and we know that it seems that the
most lasting protection would be actual
infection
but you don't want to get an actual
infection because you might get long
coveted it might kill you right i mean
it might kill you or you might get long
covered or both
so you don't want an infection under
normal circumstances but
what if you know you're gonna get an
infection
and i feel like that's where we're at
but nobody's saying it directly from the
government
i feel as if
we're all going to get covered i don't
see any way around it given the current
state of information because we don't
have a vaccine that would stop it
and we don't have a way to really run a
world without us getting together enough
and traveling enough that we'll all get
it
just all of us and so if you're all
gonna get it
here's my question
shouldn't we have a strategy that
recognizes the obvious that we're all
going to get it
or something has to be invented
to stop it
which i'm not aware of anything like
that that's coming close
rapid tests would only slow it down
they do a good job of slowing it down
but the moment you stop doing your rapid
tests you'd be right back where you were
it looks like i mean nobody can predict
that with certainty but i think the
rapid tests would get you to
just the slower
infections
now do you want slower infections or
faster infections it seems to me that my
best personal strategy which is
different from a national strategy
right what you do for yourself doesn't
have to be exactly the same as what you
might want for the country or other
people to do
my personal best thing i could do i
think and i'm going to ask for a medical
fact check on this because i'm not a
doctor so don't listen to me on medical
stuff
but given that i was recently vaccinated
given my age and comorbidities
and given the fact that i'm at the peak
of my vaccine's effectiveness right now
shouldn't i get infected intentionally
because that's the safest way to be for
me to get the virus
that i'm going to get one way or the
other
if you only have two choices get the
virus
when you're the safest or get it when
you're the least safe
why wouldn't you get it when you're the
safest
now
that's a question because obviously if
you give yourself you know access to the
virus even with the vaccine could he get
long coveted could he get some long-term
problem i don't know
maybe it's part of the risk could the
vaccination itself kill you yeah sure
i mean maybe
not likely but
could happen
so
i guess what i don't understand is that
the country doesn't have a
strategy that's coherent
if we had a plan to get rid of covet
that'd be great but we don't do we
because we don't have a vaccine that'll
do it we don't have one on the
on the way that will do it if
therapeutics won't do it
we don't have a plan for just avoiding
it
so if the only plan is that we're going
to get it
shouldn't they be telling us to load up
on therapeutics if any of them work
and to get your vaccine
vaccination and get infected as soon as
possible
yeah your government can't tell you to
do that right
i've been telling you from the beginning
that the government is great at some
stuff
but one of the things they can't do
is tell you to do something that could
kill you
unless it's you know war
if it's a war they can tell you to go to
war and some of you die
but
for lifestyle stuff
the government just has to avoid killing
people that's that's it
they don't care about your freedom
because they're not going to be measured
on that they're going could be measured
on how many people die
so the government doesn't have the right
incentive
relative to what the people want to be
in charge i've told you this before the
the citizens are going to have to take
control of the pandemic
with the help of the government and
science and all the information we can
get but you have to have the right
people making the decision
and at the moment the right people to
make the decision are not the government
and i think that's rare it's hard to
think of other examples where the
government should not make your decision
they are after all elected
representatives
ish
that's another topic they're elected
sort of
uh
but i think we just have to acknowledge
the obvious let's acknowledge the
obvious the citizens should be in charge
of this decision
and if joe biden just took a poll
and said look
the government doesn't quite have the
right structure for this decision i'm
just going to look at the polls
if you guys
if you guys and people and all of you
these if you if you want to go back to
work and you want to take the risk
because you at least have the option of
the vaccine
i'll support that
and just let the public decide
have we ever done that before has the
government of the united states ever
said look
it really sort of depends what the
public wants that's going to be the
biggest variable so just tell me what
you want
and on this question i'm going to follow
the polls i'll follow the science also
but if the if the public knows the
science as well as i do
and knows the risks and the reward
maybe just you know let the people
decide
all right um
i think there's something called a trump
curse because kathy griffin tragically
got lung cancer and she doesn't even
smoke i guess she was addicted to pills
after the trump beheading uh
scandal and i guess she attempt
attempted suicide
[Music]
that's telling me i need to leave in a
minute um it seems to me that everybody
who's a trump critic and even people who
are the biggest supporters
have some horrible thing happen to them
like a lot
so i'm just following that and that's
tragic and i hope she she does well
um
how about this how about we put a
warning on
uh unvaccinated status the way you would
put a warning on cigarettes
if cigarettes are legal and they kill
half a million people a year
why don't we do the same with covet if
it's here to stay and just say this all
right here's an example now this is a
persuasion
example not i'm not telling you to take
the vaccination that's up to you but if
you wanted to persuade people
you could put a cigarette warning on it
that says something like
not getting vaccinated substantially
increases the risk of dying a gruesome
death gasping for air with a ventilator
stuck down your trachea
how about just put a warning on it say
look we're going to open i'm going to
open everything no masks
no lockdown
but look public
i want you to know how clearly
i'm going to tell you the risk
let's say this is the government let's
say joe biden did this i'm gonna i'm
gonna get rid of all the restrictions at
a national level
and i'm gonna put this warning label on
it if you don't get the vaccination
there's a really good chance i mean put
some odds on it there's a chance
of dying a gruesome death gasping for
air with a trait with a ventilator stuck
down your throat
isn't that fair
would anybody say that that warning is
not accurate you mean you don't say
everybody it doesn't happen to everybody
but it's a risk and it's real now you
might also say getting the vaccination
as a risk
right
but say that too
let the government inform us and we'll
make our own decisions about that
uh here's your fake news of the day clay
travis tweeted this he said joe biden's
top cove advisor just went on cnn
admitted that masks people are wearing
don't work against covet
so that was the tweet from clay travis
but that's not true
the
the video he showed
was biden's advisor covent advisor
saying that the masks don't work as well
as other masks
so not working as well as other masks is
completely different
from don't work
so that would be fake news all right
that
is all i had to say today except that
the
uh it'd be funny to see if the iq in
america changes after the pandemic
because
i think you would agree with this
statement
it's either true that the smart people
are getting vaccinated
or it's true that the smart people are
not getting vaccinated would you agree
that
one of those two things is probably true
right now you all you all think you know
which way it's going to go but let's
just for this conversation say could go
either way
wouldn't you like to know
if the average iq goes up or down the
way average lifespan did because of
pandemic because if
the smartest people
are making the right decisions
they should be
the iq should go up because they're more
smart people surviving and dumb people
are dying
but what if
it's the other way around
what if
the iq goes down
because the smart people took the
vaccination and all died
i don't think that's going to happen by
the way but but it could right
anything's possible
so what would happen if all the smart
people made the wrong decision on this
one
what are the odds
pretty good
the odds that all the smartest people
made the wrong decision
were pretty good i'm not saying they did
i'm just saying the odds are pretty good
all right that's all i got for now i
gotta run i'll talk to you later
