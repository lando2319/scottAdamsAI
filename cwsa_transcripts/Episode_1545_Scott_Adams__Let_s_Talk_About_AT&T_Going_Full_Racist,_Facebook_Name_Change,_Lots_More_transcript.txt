well well well look at all you lucky
beautiful smart people
well except for you except for you no
the rest of you are fine but you
no i'm just kidding you're all beautiful
you're sexy in your own way
and some of the smartest people on the
entire planet but not only are you smart
you are powerful
you don't know how yet but wait are you
here
it's pretty cool there's a good story
coming you don't want to miss that
and
i don't think i have to tell you that
this is the best thing that's ever
happened anywhere on this earth this
universe or or
the metaverse yes thank you zuckerberg
but the only way to make it better
the one way to make it better is with
the simultaneous sip
and all you need for that is a cup of
mushroom glass a tanker jealous a
steiner canteen jug flask vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and
just because
we're special i'm going to do the
simultaneous sip as
cornholio
yes
i'd like you all to join me
if you're doing this at home
this is a must
pull your shirt up over your head
it's time for i know i know you've been
asking for this the cornholio
simultaneous sip
get ready get ready for the corn holier
simultaneous sip go
that is some good corn holy 07
well
if that doesn't tell you how this live
stream is going to go nothing will
i think that covers it
um
let's talk about some things well uh
zuckerberg mark zuckerberg has announced
that facebook will be changing its name
to
meta
meta
because it's going to be building on a
metaverse
um i don't know if they thought this
through completely
but the memes have already started
they're calling it metamucil
i think that one's going to stick
i've got a feeling that metamucil is
going to stick
but
brian of london retweeted a tweet from
irene rabinowitz
who mentions that metta is
in the hebrew language it means she is
dead
she is dead
which is not terribly off point if
you're building the biggest nerd
environment in the world
might not be too many women there i
don't know
but
uh
so
here's what's a big deal about this
facebook change
if you think the only thing that
facebook is doing
is rebranding because you know they
don't like the whatever stain is on
their old brand
or if you think it's not a big deal
i think you're wrong
i think this is one of the biggest
bets or one of the biggest plays
in the history of civilization
and i think it's the right play
i think zuckerberg's uh ability to spot
you know a good opportunity and make a
bold move
may be better than anybody
maybe better than anybody whatever you
think about mark zuckerberg there's one
thing that you don't ever hear about him
where you don't hear it much anyway
lately
what's the one thing you don't hear
about mark zuckerberg as a criticism
he's not good at his job
nobody says that
right
he gets criticized for you know like
some of the communication stuff and
you know of course their facebook is
criticized for everything from privacy
to manipulation to censoring and all
that but that's sort of built into the
model
you can't really have a facebook without
those criticisms because it's hard to
balance that stuff
but
i don't think anyone ever says
zuckerberg is anything less than
spectacular
as as a leader
yeah i mean you have you have many
different complaints and i think they're
all relatively
credible complaints
but he's really really really good at
his job
even if you don't like him even if you
don't like facebook i'm not a big fan of
facebook but dear god he's good at his
job let's give him that okay can we give
them that and you can still be fully
critical
but i think you have to give them that
now
when zuckerberg says i'm the metaverse
is such a big deal i'm gonna change the
company's name
he really means that
think how big the uh
metaverse could get
compared to even social media when you
think of social media you say to
yourself my god
you know you've got 7.8 billion people
and maybe half of them could use social
media so you have billions of potential
customers
true
the metaverse
way bigger
so if if if this metaverse thing works
the amount of money each user will spend
it's going to go through the roof
because you're going to be buying things
like digital art to put on your wall
yes i will be producing
more nfts of dilbert art
so that they're available for the
metaverse
now i don't know if you can directly put
an nft on your wall in the metaverse but
if they miss that that would be a big
mistake
because they could make a lot of money
selling furniture for your online
room and your decorations and stuff
and i plan to be there selling some
digital art for your digital space
now
so that i would say that the potential
monetary potential of the metaverse
is probably
10 to 100 times
bigger than facebook's current market
would anybody disagree with that
so so my take is that the face facebook
is entering market that could be 10 to
100 times bigger than their current
market
who wants to disagree with that
anybody
um now if you haven't used uh
vr
you don't know what's ahead all right i
have used virtual reality with the
goggles and stuff and i used it a few
years ago
a few years ago and imagine how much
better it is in two years but just two
years ago it was so powerful
that i couldn't step off a cliff in
virtual reality
my my brain and my body simply wouldn't
let me take a step
into what the virtual goggles said was a
cliff
that i would go over even though i could
take the goggles off and see my own
floor
and then i could put them back on and
say take the step and i couldn't do it
i just couldn't do it and it wasn't i
was afraid exactly it's like my brain
and my body just wouldn't cooperate
i couldn't kill myself in vr
now the the power of it is way beyond
what you imagine it's a real world you
you will internalize the virtual reality
as if real
suddenly your looks are going to matter
a lot less
people are going to get married and have
entire lifetimes in the virtual reality
people will be married and have sex
in virtual
worlds
people will be married for years without
ever meeting their corporeal
entities
they will simply live in the virtual
world because you know a lot of people
are have physical problems they they
can't compete on the
they can't compete in the swipe left
swipe right universe
you know only the top five percent of
men or whatever it is get all the women
in the real world
but in the virtual world
everybody's gonna
look like whatever they want to look
like
i think people are going to have full
relationships in the virtual world and
essentially just
try to make money in the real world to
pay for it
but here's the weird thing
you will be able to make you will be
able to make a lot of money in the
virtual world
so you could live in the virtual world
with a
a spouse and even kids
you could take your 23andme data
and compare it to the 23 and me data of
your virtual spouse
and have the algorithm create a virtual
baby
that's based on your dna
yes really
really
you could actually have the data
to create a virtual digital baby
for your digital marriage in the in the
metaverse
all right are you starting to get an
idea of how big this is
whatever you think the size of this is
it's a hundred times bigger than that
because your imagination
can't capture its size
in the same way we can't understand what
a trillion is
you know it's a word
it's big but you can't really conceive
of a trillion of anything
you can't conceive of the metaverse
the metaverse is
functionally infinite
it's just going to be crazy it's going
to be crazy
so uh i think zuckerberg is right on
on the money on this call it's a really
big bold call and i i just think he's
brilliant to do this
uh wendy's the the fast food company
wendy's
had a good
good pr
campaign today
and they said they're going to change
their name from wendy's to meet
m-e-a-t
so it's like meta for dyslexics now i
think that was a good idea but if i were
wendy's i would have changed it to
probably face meat
because if you get some wendy's food you
can put it in your face
so i like face meat
now i jokingly said on twitter
that i wonder if
zuckerberg considered instead of calling
it meta
had he considered it calling the meta
now
five percent of you just chuckled to
yourself because you get that reference
anybody get it
how about calling it the meta
anybody anybody
yeah some of you are laughing it comes
from the movie the social network
and there was a scene there where remind
me the
real world person who was associated
with i think justin timberlake played
the character sean parker
sean parker in the movie which is based
loosely on real life not not terribly
closely
but
allegedly he's the one who told
zuckerberg
that his original name was the facebook
and apparently parker said yeah it's
better just facebook
anyway
that's a big deal
here's a uh oh and let me give you the
biggest deal
there's something really big ahead with
this meta first
that you don't see coming
until you see it and when you see it
it's going to change everything
and it goes like this
once you live in the metaverse in the
virtual world
where where most of your life you know
your social your social life and maybe
even your business life
once those are
ported into the
virtual world the simulated world
what are you going to believe about the
world you just left behind
you're going to wonder if that was
simulated too
but you won't be really worried about it
until within the simulation
you create another metaverse
so if the metaverse creates a sub
metaverse so that the people in the
metaverse can get on their computers in
the better verse and put on their
goggles in the metaverse and go into a
sub metaverse
everything you know about reality will
change
because you're going to realize the true
nature of reality is that we were always
in a simulation
always
and one way to now is when your
simulation creates a new simulation the
sub simulation that's the point
when you know you you know the nature of
reality
so that's ahead
i give that less than 10 years
all right um
jeff
pilkington uh had an interesting tweet
today
do you know what the
screenplay for rust was about
this is of course the movie that
had the alec baldwin tragic accidental
shooting
apparently the screenplay for the movie
that had the accidental shooting
was meant to tell the story of an
accidental shooting
and its consequences
there was an accidental shooting on a
movie about an accidental shooting
simulation
i don't even know how to explain a lot
of this stuff it does seem like a pretty
big coincidence
here's another one
now this is just weird
um by strange coincidence you know my
wife christina
is flying uh aerobatic airplanes
so there's an airport nearby she can get
she can get an aerobatic
rent one for an hour and go up and do
loop-de-loops and stuff which she does
fairly often and she's preparing for a
competition
one of the planes at the hangar that she
goes to is tom cruise's old plane
so tom cruise is a pilot
and he's flown uh
a pits it's a type of an airplane that
they use for aerobatics
and his old airplane just ended up at
this hangar because airplanes get bought
and sold quite a bit so christina
sometimes flies tom cruise's old
airplane
and she also is
just finished up her studying for ifr
which is the ability to fly in
non-visible conditions such as through
clouds
so she hasn't she hasn't got her ifr yet
she has to actually get the the check
ride it's called but she's completed the
study for it she just has to do one
detail to get it so as i'm thinking
about christina
and tom cruise's airplane and getting
her ifr i turn on this movie called
oblivion didn't know anything about it
there's tom cruise flying a futuristic
plane
into a cloud of dust where he doesn't
have visibility so effectively he's
trying to fly ifr without
without the right instruments
now one of the odds
that all of that would be happening
like tom cruise airplanes ifr all at the
same time
it's just weird this is weird
coincidence sure but it's weird
um there's a new poll out of virginia
corey deangelis tweeted this
that terry mcauliffe running for
governor is polling at 45 this is a fox
news bowl
and his competition glenn young kid is a
53.
until a few days ago this was a dead
heat
and now youngkin is up by
is up 53 to 45.
now of course poland can be all over the
place and this
this looks like you know a fox news poll
that goes in the direction fox news
wants it you have to ask yourself some
questions there
but
this is immediately after biden
campaigned for him
did
did biden's campaigning for terry
mcauliffe hurt his chances
i mean i think you did but maybe
but here's what i think i think this is
another example of
uh i i keep having to remind you that
the public runs the country
the government doesn't run this country
the public does the public does and
always will with our current system
but you don't see it
because the public isn't that energized
over topics that
you know or could kind of go either way
you know if the public is sort of 50 50
on something
then we do delegate it to the government
it's just a way to solve a you know
stalemate and even if things are close
you know not thai but close we still
like to delegate that to the government
because it's just easier you know it's
something we can all agree on it's like
oh i hate that decision but at least the
system worked and you know majority got
its way at least that's good
so but but i want to remind you that
these numbers probably changed because
the public
has an opinion about school
that
is different from maybe one of these
candidates and i think the public is
essentially taking control of the issue
that's what it looks like
it looks like the public has decided to
take
the decision about how schools are run
in terms of how your kids are taught i
think the public just decided to take
back the power
you know
corey d'angelos was also quoting
uh tweeting some stuff
about some uh
some some school districts you know
getting out of the national uh
organizations etc uh you're seeing
you're seeing a pretty big uh trend
uh for taking power away from the
government and you can see a lot more of
that
uh erasmus poll says 57
of the respondents said the economy is
worse since biden started
57 percent say it's worse since biden
started that's not re-election numbers
now no matter who you blame but 38 blame
biden 22 said it was the dems in
congress and 31 who said it was the
republicans in congress
but those are some bad bad numbers
now i wonder if if trump had been in
charge
would things be different
i don't know
it's hard to say isn't it
but i think we'll find out what happens
when republicans are in charge of
congress that's going to happen pretty
soon i think
are you ready for a cool story that
involves you
you all ready
here is something that
you did
that's really cool
and you should be very proud of this and
i'm not kidding
literally you
did something really cool
and i want to
congratulate you and thank you and
here's the story
many of you remember i was talking about
a tweet storm from ryan peterson he's
the ceo of flexport
he did a tweet thread
about some logical solutions to the
supply chain problem
how many do you remember that i talked
about that some of it had to do with
getting rid of regulations so you could
stack the empty storage containers
i think there was something else about
you know where you could put the empties
et cetera
now
uh
ryan has 70 about 76 000 followers and
probably he gained a number this week
because that was a big viral
viral tweet but i think i was the first
big account to retweet it
now fact check me on this but there's a
story in the la times today
that is crediting um three people for
sort of boosting his signal
and i'll tell you what happened when the
signal got boosted this is the fun part
i'm holding off on the fun part okay
it's coming
so according to uh a story in los
angeles times day it's behind the pay
wall but i i signed up just to see it
the following morning
after the
tweets read
peterson tweeted this all out and his
thread became a rare viral sensation
about logistics
it's hard to have a viral tweet about
logistics
but he did it
and here's what here's what the la times
said about it they said
big thinkers from the worlds of business
politics and media shared his tweets
here are the examples they gave
coinbase chief executive brian armstrong
uh shared it with the comments
bureaucracy and red tape abounds
and then he said
charmaine yost vice president of the
heritage foundation tweeted about it
and
then they mentioned me
um dilbert cartoonist who they call a
right-wing political commentator
so the la times says brandon be a
right-wing
political commentator
what do you think
am i a right-wing political commentator
kind of yes
kind of yes in the sense that a lot of
my audience is lean's right
so if i'm a commentator and i'm
commentating to people who lean right am
i a
uh
am i a uh
far right what am i called
uh
or right wing yeah not far right but
right way i think that's fair
now uh
on social stuff i'm left to bernie but
i'm better at math so i know his plans
don't work
but i like his philosophy i just don't
think his plans are practical
anyway so here's what happened
so this thread um and i think i was the
first of the people mentioned who
tweeted it and i imagine some of them
probably saw it from my tweet
now
what do you think happened when this
tweet went viral
here's the fun part
within hours
governor newsom was getting
just pecked to death apparently
by all the people saying have you seen
this tweet what the hell are you doing
about it you know why aren't you
implementing these ideas
so within hours
hours
of
promoting this tweet
within hours the government was uh
activated
gavin newsom picked up the phone and
called ryan peterson
he called them personally and said saw
your everybody sending me your tweet
thread
you know what do i need to know what do
we need to do differently
now i don't know the details but
apparently
something happened pretty quickly
so quickly in fact
that
by the time i tweeted it i was hearing
stories already about
long beach
changing some regulations
and i think i told you at the time
they must have been contemplating those
changes already
because it couldn't happen so fast
because it happened right after the
tweeting
but now i think it might have
it might have just happened really fast
i think the government just said wait a
minute wait a minute
we didn't quite know that if we make
these small changes it could have a
sizable impact
and so it looks like governor newsom
did what you'd want a government to do
called the person who was the expert
took us seriously listened to him and
then immediately acted it looks like
now i need some fact checks on this and
some confirmation but that's what it
looks like
now how would this happen without you
right
how would how would that have happened
without you
i don't think it would have because if i
don't have a big enough platform i can't
retweet things with any effect at all
all right so because i follow uh ryan
peterson and because i've got a lot of
followers
i i don't know if the other people who
tweeted it saw first on my tweet but
there's a good chance of that and and
whether or not that happened or things
were going to happen on their own anyway
it does it does show the model doesn't
it
because this isn't the first time
that somebody's presented an idea to me
or i've had an idea
and we've used the power of the social
media to
insert it into the government's thinking
fairly immediately
and then actually getting action fairly
immediately
it's actually kind of amazing isn't it
now before you get too excited this
doesn't really solve the supply chain
problem
turns out you need some special
equipment to put
especially trained people to put the
cartons on top of each other turns out
that even if you stack them you still
have your tens of thousands short of
what you need to get things going
but it looks like a step in the right
direction
and
it looks like they're opening up storage
places you know nearby to move the
empties that was always part of the
solution
but here's the amazing part
i don't think the government
was talking to the right people
before
is that what it feels like
like who was the government talking to
that they didn't already know to do
these things because even though ryan
peterson
seems to be more informed than most
people i mean this is his business he
works in this area
the governor didn't talk to somebody who
was as equally well informed and could
have said hey let me take a look at it
i'll get back to you in 24 hours
goes down looks at it saying yeah it
looks like the problem is x and y
i don't know
but it does look like
uh one citizen with an opinion and
taking some action made a difference i
did have the feeling remember i've been
complaining for a while that it looked
like there was no leadership
on the supply chain thing
and i think we confirmed it
it looks like the public had to take
control in this case ryan
had to take control because the
government wasn't doing it and it looked
like they weren't doing anything and he
actually even offered to be in charge of
it for the country
so if baiden wanted to he won't
but he could appoint ryan peterson as
the
supply chain czar
and just empower him with emergency
powers you know of course everything
gets approved to the president probably
and just say can you just go fix this
now there may be a limit to what we can
do
but don't you want somebody who is this
effective at least being the one making
that the call
i think so
somebody says please knows ours well
maybe you wouldn't call them azar and it
would have to be a short-term assignment
um
is it okay
all right there's a new study
um
looking at the association between
vitamin d and covalent outcomes and the
new study
uh was trying to untangle whether
it's just a coincidence
that people who are most likely to die
from covet have low vitamin d or there's
a causation
and
they seem to have ruled out
the fact that uh people who are already
in bad shape have low vitamin d and
that's the problem
it seems to be
uh well maybe i'm saying that wrong but
the the point of it is that vitamin d
it's another study that suggests
doesn't prove
doesn't prove
but again strongly suggests that you
could get deaths down to near zero
if you had enough vitamin d in everybody
now it's hypothetical because you can't
get enough vitamin d in everybody but if
you could
and then i saw another study that showed
there was a specific kind of pill
that might be what a new way to get
enough vitamin d into somebody quickly
so it's not the kind of vitamin d you
buy over the counter
those are relatively weak compared to
what you need but apparently there's a
new pill that could you know boost your
vitamin d more effectively so i don't
have details on that i don't know if it
works exactly or if it's just hype
uh and i'm not totally convinced that
vitamin d is the answer but there's more
indication of it but are you ready for
the most mind-blowing thing you've heard
all day
are you ready
this will be the most mind-blowing thing
you've heard all day
i promise you
i promise you this will blow your mind
i'm going to give you a number of facts
and then watch them all come together
are you ready
no your mind i'm only going to blow your
mind
did all of you see the kamala harris
meme that's going around
there's a a doctored video of kabul
harris
appare she looks like she's apparently
at a cnn town hall
except let's just say that the topic of
the town hall has been altered
i won't mention it on this live stream
but
it's pretty funny
and i was actually asked if it was real
so and i i knew when i saw somebody's
gonna think this was real
and sure enough
i i was asked if it was real
uh which is the hilarious part
knowing that some people thought is real
go look at it it's in my my twitter
feeds this morning just knowing that
some people think is real that's the
joke
the joke is not really the meme it's
knowing that people think it's real
that's the joke all right all right
here's here's the mind-blowing part
here are some things that are associated
with inflammation
all right
so people who have more inflammation
than the average
would fall into these categories
uh
african-american let's say black because
we're talking about the whole world uh
black people have apparently more
inflammation
did you know that
if you're black you either respond to
inflammation more or where you have more
inflammation i think it ends up being
about the same
so being black is actually a risk factor
for inflammation in general
i didn't know that here's another one
being old
almost guarantees you have more
inflammation
being old
right
so being black or being old gives you
inflammation here's another one obesity
did you know that obesity is strongly
correlated with inflammation
it is
is anybody getting ahead of me yet
you see where you see where it's going
right
diabetic
did you know that diabetes
is associated with inflammation
it is it is
how about smoking smoking cigarettes did
you know that smoking cigarettes
is associated with
inflammation
it is
um how about a lack of vitamin d
it's associated with inflammation
it is
now
get ahead of me a little bit what do all
these things have in common
being black being old obese diabetic
smoker and lacking vitamin d what do all
those things have in common besides
inflammation
those are the comorbidities
all of the covid comorbidities
are inflammation related
and vitamin d
is an anti-inflammatory
and we know that if you take vitamin d
and anti-inflammatory it's other things
it's not just an anti-inflammatory but
it's also that
do you know what else is considered an
anti-inflammatory besides vitamin d
aspirin
recent studies indicate again not proven
i suppose that aspirin might be good uh
help against uh covet
is also an anti-inflammatory
um how about fluvoxamine we just heard
that there is a antidepressant
that's a good against
covet
coincidentally
it's also an anti-inflammatory
in addition to being
an antidepressant
how about uh have you heard of a drug
called ivermectin
i've remembered anybody ever hear that
in addition to its antibacterial
properties
do you know what else it is
it's an anti it's a anti-inflammatory
it's an anti-inflammatory
um
and do you know what
prednisone is people get prednisone when
they have covenants it works really well
do you know what prednisone is
aside from other things
it's an it's an anti-inflammatory
anti-inflammatory
so all the things that are
co-morbidities are associated with
inflammation
and and most of the things except for
the vaccinations i suppose
most of the things that we find that
work
against covid to protect you
are also anti-inflammatories
is that a coincidence is any of this a
coincidence
are you ready for the mind-blowing part
you ready hold on
i'm going to tell you one other
anti-inflammatory
apparently it's pretty powerful there's
one other thing that you don't need a
prescription for but we don't do a lot
of it in this country
it's something you'd see more in another
country
possibly a country that's not having as
much trouble with covet as we are and
inexplicably so
it's called green tea
have you heard of it
very popular in china
if you drink a lot of green tea
apparently it's really good for your
inflammation
reduces it
yeah
so
i'm not claiming this as a fact i'm just
saying
that coincidentally and i'm going to say
coincidentally
the country that's blamed for maybe
releasing the coronavirus
accidentally or we don't know
but probably accidentally
is also the one country
that by lifestyle choice already had low
inflammation
because of the green tea
and i'm pretty sure and japan also
didn't have much trouble
in fact the asian companies countries
didn't have much trouble
somebody says mine not blown oh andrew
i'm not done with you
i'm not done with you your mind will be
blown
it's coming up
are you ready
here's the next twist and by the way i'm
not suggesting
that china had a master plan to infect
everybody except china because they
drink green tea it could be a
coincidence
but if i were just designing a weapon
that would affect other people and not
affect my countrymen i would have i
would invent one
that was deactivated by green tea
because by the time anybody found out
they'd already be dead
all right here's my next
mind-blowing
um change
in the beginning of a pandemic
what is your best strategy
you don't know anything
because it's the beginning of the
pandemic it's the fog of war you don't
know what you're doing how do you what
do you do you do everything you do
everything because you don't know how
how bad this is going to get
and you don't know what works
so you just do everything
masks yes
social distancing yes
close down businesses yes stop travel
yes
just do everything
but that's like the first week or two
right
as information comes in
you learn oh wait a minute we didn't
have to wash everything we didn't need
to wear gloves
so you start with everything because
you're just guessing
and then you as you get data you back
off and now nobody's really
has anybody checked your temperature
recently going into a building
because i think that just stopped right
we realized that wasn't helping
and we stopped washing our food because
it didn't make any difference you know
your packages don't have it etc
so as as a pandemic progresses
and you get smarter
you manage it differently so that's the
only thing i'm trying to say is that you
don't manage things the beginning of the
pandemic the way you would manage it in
the middle of the pandemic
and here's the next part
you don't manage it the same at the end
of the pandemic either and we're kind of
doing that
that's our problem
what if
what if we treated this as an
inflammation crisis
and not a virus crisis per se
because it's the inflammation that's
killing people and not just from covet
right the inflammation is killing people
a whole bunch of different ways
we have this gigantic inflammation
crisis
that we have mistakenly imagined is a
covet crisis
it's all it's also a coveted crisis but
here's what i'm suggesting
if if the government told you all right
we did a pretty good job getting the
virus down to a manageable level it's
probably not going to ever get lower
but let's work really hard on
lowering our inflammation what happened
when
when we did the lockdown
the lockdown made everybody fat and
increased their inflammation
the lockdown apparently caused cigarette
smoking to go way up
like 25 percent i heard
inflammation
probably everything that people were
doing was causing more inflammation
stress
inflammation
right so imagine if your government said
look
uh we're toward the end of the
pandemic and we're going to change the
frame the way we frame the problem
is no longer just trying to get the
virus we'll do that too you know
vaccinations won't stop for example but
everybody go lose weight
stop drinking
stop smoking
and just get rid of your inflammation
make sure you got vitamin d
imagine just imagine a leader coming out
and say it's inflammation people and
it's your lifestyle
and if you change your lifestyle you'll
be you'll be far safer
from yeah cortisol from stress exactly
so our government should be telling us
to meditate exercise eat right quit
drinking
and quit smoking
am i right
if your government was telling you those
things and really be serious about it i
mean not a mandate of course but really
serious about it
i would feel completely different
and i would also think that that would
be a reason a government could reopen
everything and make the masks go away
say look we we now have a different
strategy for the end of the pandemic and
it's managing inflammation which is
really a lifestyle question
let's stop the mass let's stop the man
the mandates let's stop the
social distancing and limits on
businesses let's go back to normal
with the businesses but let's not go
back to normal with how you live your
life
because you're
you're causing too much inflammation
and then just start informing people
where the inflammation is coming from
i like governments as a source of
information when they do it right like
the apr for lending that's that's a
government invention and that's done
right it's really useful
the uh nutrition guidelines may be not
so useful so the government is wonderful
when they give you the right information
and it's useful they're terrible when
they give you the wrong information but
i think that they could give the right
information they could just say here
here's the list of things that cause
inflammation and therefore make you
weak when you get the coronavirus don't
do these things
please don't do these things you can
it's legal nobody's going to stop you
but please don't hit the gym
does anyone still trust the government
well i would trust them if they say the
same thing i say
i would trust the government if they say
you should exercise more
and you know meditate and
do some things that are just common
sense good for you
all right
at t has decided to go full racist
um you may know my story as background
uh which or retelling basically i worked
for pacific bell which was sort of a
sister company to att or a cousin
company maybe
and
um i was i lost
two careers at the phone company because
they told me i was white and male i
already knew that but they told me that
they couldn't promote me
because they needed more diversity
now that hasn't changed oh i'll tell you
another story this is something that
happened when i was working for pacific
bell
they they brought a document to each of
the employees that you had to sign
and you had to sign the document that
said you understood that diversity um
made the company stronger
i think they used other words but the
the essence of it was that diversity was
an advantage and you have to sign it
to say you you agree you understand that
and i was handed to you and i said
i understand what you're saying
but is there some study that proves that
diversity is an advantage
now in my opinion diversity is
unavoidable
why are we even having the conversation
if you live in a super diverse place you
kind of have to have diverse employees
or you know there's going to be trouble
so diversity is a requirement i think of
living in a in a diverse civilization
but
but where's the study
but where's the study that says it is an
advantage certainly it's a requirement
in my opinion
but an advantage
who did the controlled study where he
had no diversity and then you compared
it to the group with diversity
i don't think it's been done
so i said
i'm not opposed to the concept
but i'm not going to sign something that
clearly i don't think is
proven in any way so i refused to sign
it
i'm the only one
i think i was the only one in the
company
i think a company of i don't know
however many
tens of thousands employees
i'll bet you i was the only one who
didn't sign it
there was no there was no pushback
because i just gave my reasons i just
said
i'm open to the concept
but do you have any evidence for this
claim
why am i signing on to something that
doesn't have evidence
if you're telling me it's common sense
then i say
i don't know i can see your argument
that part is common sense
but i don't think that common sense is
how we make decisions
is it
i mean not when data is available if you
have data
i will use the data in case my common
sense has some bias in it
so i refused to sign it and there was no
pushback
i don't know if you know this about me
but you don't want to give me attention
i think that was my magic power when i
worked for the phone company because i
also got them to change the smoking in
the office policy
by going home and telling them that i
declared the office an unsafe workplace
because that was company policy you were
allowed to declare your own workplace
and unsafe
unsafe you know physically unsafe so i
just declared it unsafe i said there's
all this tobacco smoke in here
it could hurt me
and the company just caved and said okay
they changed the whole policy of the
building and pretty soon everything was
non-smoking
now i think my superpower is that people
know i'm not they know i'm not going to
go away
and i cause a lot of trouble
so i think if it's a smallish problem
they're going to just let us elect
what is red herring persuasion i've been
asked 500 times
uh
but thank you for continuing to ask that
question
i don't know what is it
uh is there a reason you're asking
or is that somebody's other show or
something i don't i don't understand the
question so you can ask it 500 more
times and i'll ignore it
all right
here's uh here's what att is doing today
now i worked for a pack bell that was so
not a t exactly but it came from 18t
originally
um so this is the report about ett the
att has created a racial
re-education program that promotes the
idea that american racism is uniquely
white trait
uh and they boost uh they're boosting
reparations defunding the police and
trans activism
now i don't care about the trans
activism um
because i'm pro-trans
you know
which is different than saying you agree
with everything right but i'm pro-trans
so i don't think that's really the the
the topic so let's forget about that for
now
uh it's it's a this is a separate topic
i'm not saying it's not important it's
just a separate topic
and on
some of their internal documents to
re-educate their employees
includes a resource called white america
if you want to know who's responsible
for racism look in the mirror
the article claims that the united
states is a racist society and lays down
his thesis plainly quote white people
you are the problem
regardless of how much you say you
detest racism you are the sole reason
has flourished for centuries
that's true by the way
does anybody disagree with that
that white people are the source of
historical racism i mean nothing's an
absolute right but as a general true
statement
yeah
yeah historically
that's absolutely true
the author darlene glanton writes the
american racism as a uniquely white
trait
and that black people cannot be racist
white women she claims have been telling
lies on black men since they were first
brought to america in chains well that's
true
that is true
and along with their white male
counterpoints quote enjoy the
opportunities and privileges that white
supremacy affords them
there's gonna be some cursing coming up
i can't help it
i'm sorry
all right i waited until the end so
those of you don't like the cursing can
can bail out
but
i would like to point out that there is
a company that a white person doesn't
have a good employment opportunity with
it's called att
if you're white
especially if you're male
and you go to work for a t
you're a idiot
can i say that more clearly
if you're white
especially male
mostly male 1
and you work for att and you apply for a
job there you're a idiot because
they're going to discriminate the
out of you
they don't want you at that company they
need diversity
and actually i support that i do think
the company
needs diversity because in a diverse
civilization you just have to i mean i'm
not even going to give reasons for it i
think it's that obvious
diverse civilization
you're a giant company you've got to be
diverse
that's not optional
but the way they're going about it
is purely racist
it's not even a little bit not racist
it's not even arguable
it is 100 percent anti-white racism and
if you're a white male you should sell
your stock
you should
convince other people to sell their
stock and never buy their company
and att is about to discover that their
products are something called
a commodity
now for those of you not steeped in
economic terminology
do you know what a commodity means
a commodity means there's nothing to
stop you from discontinuing their
service and buying one just like it
somewhere else for the same price
it's a commodity
and they just went full racist
on the plurality of the of the
population
i'll tell you if you're an att
stockholder i don't give financial
advice
but i'd be panicked right now
i'd be panicked right now
i'm going to make it my personal mission
to put att out of business
now i'm very much against boycotts
for political reasons
political boycotts are just terrible
like you know let's say the ceo
has an opinion
i don't want to put that company out of
business
let's say the company
leans democrat or republican or
something i don't want to put that
company out of business that's political
this isn't political
this is just racist
if there's an american company that has
declared publicly that they plan to be
racist and then they're acting on it
 that company
they have to be put out of business
so it's not really a question of
let's see what trouble i got coming in
oh good
um
so the att question is not really a
question of uh
a difference of opinion or politics
they have to be put out of business
they have to be shut down
unless they change their policy but this
is pure racism and i'm going to make it
a personal mission to make sure that
anybody who does business with anybody
who's white
who does business with att as an idiot
you're just idiot you're just
burying yourself
there is a limit
and this is it
there's a limit
and you just reach today t you deserve
to go out of business for this
this is a big enough mistake
the whole business needs to be shut down
for it that's how bad it is
if you think it's less than that
you're missing the big story here
they're saying in public that you don't
have a career if you're white
and uh especially male
you okay with that
let me ask my uh black viewers
of which i assume they're i assume i've
got a few here
i always hear from you on twitter if
you're black
tell me in the comments if you're okay
with att's view because remember if it's
okay for
if it's okay that they could do that to
somebody else
do you want to live in that world
is that okay for you i mean i realized
it would be good for you
but are you okay with it
at t on cnn
do they still
um
yeah i hear that
uh somehow i'd forgotten that the att
owns cnn
all right well i don't think that's uh
relevant to this but uh
att
um
let's see how much
how much pressure we can put on them
uh they need to go out of business
they don't need to be punished they need
to actually just go out of business and
stop existing because you got to take
down one major company
because there's going to be more of this
and it's intolerable
it's 100 intolerable
and if taking out a major
company
is what it takes let's do it let's drive
the stock to zero and put them out of
business it's commodities
do you know anybody is there anybody
here who's still using att products and
doesn't plan to change
anybody here who uses att now and
doesn't plan to change because of this
yeah i
i think a lot of you
are on the same page here it looks like
it's going to be trouble for a t
now if my name doesn't become associated
with this story i'll be really surprised
because i am after all the dilbert guy
and i am after all a victim of the same
behavior when i worked in the corporate
world
and i just declared war i'm going to
take down a major corporation
and and i mean it i want to put them out
of business i'm not looking
i'm not looking to just hurt them or
damage them or change their reputation
now if they change the policy i'm all
good
you know i don't mind if somebody makes
a mistake and then corrects it
you know i'm the guy who always says
mistakes are natural
you know it's how they handle their
mistake that i'm going to judge people
by so i'm going to judge them by how
they handle it but if they don't handle
it right they have to be put out of
business
all right
how can you help make sure you that
everybody you know knows what atd is
doing i don't think anybody should be
okay with it
don't let this distract you from taking
down china
don't worry
china's got big trouble coming
i promise you that all right that's
about all i have for today
um
i think we've solved the uh pandemic
uh maybe racism too
and i think that's a pretty good day
so let's say we made an impact on the uh
supply chain we're gonna
uh maybe get rid of racism when we
take at t down
and uh the pandemic largely largely uh
under control now so i always call that
a good day's work
everybody everybody
good days work when you say
now i always talk about the combination
of the audience and what i do as as
you're the filter for the audience
as a really a new model of something
whatever this is that's happening here
it's important
i don't know how important
what is definitely important and as the
size of my platform increases
uh so too should be the the effect of
this now i would point out that there
are less people with gigantic platforms
and bigger audiences but one of the
things they all have in common
the people with bigger platforms and
audiences
is that they're not trying to do what
i'm doing
which is try to figure out what makes
sense
and promote it i don't have a i don't
have a team
i hate long goodbyes so ended already
good point
uh that's all for today and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
