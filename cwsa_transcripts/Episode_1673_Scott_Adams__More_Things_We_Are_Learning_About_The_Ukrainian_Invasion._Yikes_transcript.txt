good morning everybody
welcome to the highlight of civilization
called
coffee with scott adams
now we might be talking about the
ukraine war because
i guess the pandemic's over so it's time
to talk about that but first let's take
it up a notch shall we
yes and all you need is a copper mug or
a glass attacker chelsea time can't and
jog a flask a vessel any kind
fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day i think makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah yeah
that's so good
so so good
i had a suggestion
uh the other day that
i should do a
um
an interview slash competition with
snoop dogg
to see who could pass out uh during
during an interview first
if you know what i mean i think that
would be hilarious do you think snoop
would take my invitation if i had a
split screen
and i said here's the deal
we're just going to do what we do if you
know what i mean if you know what i mean
wink wink
while the interview is going on
and we're going to see if my questions
get dumber than his answers
so we'll we'll see who can who can hang
in there longer i think i could take him
and by the way
me interviewing new snoop dogg
that should be pay for a pay-per-view
because because i think it would be the
best interview he ever gave
something tells me
well once again
the
science is pointing
toward my opinion
there's yet another study
which we don't we don't trust any
studies
but
they're fun to talk about
uh published in the esteemed journal
nature which is a pretty good one i
understand
and it says uh uh basically any amount
of alcohol damages your brain
that's the base the basic thing is that
any amount of alcohol
damages your brain
and they can detect it now apparently
now
i'm not so sure that they have cause and
effect right
because one of the things they do is
they say
okay we looked at these people who had
you know one beer a day
and their brains were were smaller
than or they looked like what
their brains appeared two years older
than those who drank only half a beer
so if you had two beers your brain
looked
two years older than if you had half a
beer
but something tells me
there are probably a lot of things going
on with the people who drink more
alcohol
compared to the people who don't
am i right
because at the very least
some other people might be reading books
while you're drinking
if that were the only difference
one day a week you drink and maybe one
day a week somebody else reads a book
i don't know i think you'd see a
difference in the brains after a while
wouldn't you it doesn't mean that the
it doesn't necessarily mean that the
alcohol is shrinking your brain
could mean that the reading increases it
or keeps it younger
so i would imagine there are lots of
correlations that they didn't pick up in
this study
just guessing but it agrees with me so i
tell you about it
well he let's talk about all the fake
news
we'll start with trump-related fake news
i call it fake news that trump called
putin a genius although it actually
happened
it's fake news
but it literally happened
and the fake part is the context they
put it in
so here's trump explaining in his own
words the next day after he got some
criticism for calling putin smart
i guess he was talking to a fundraiser
at mar-a-lago when he said
they say trump said putin's smart
i mean he's taking over a country for
two dollars worth of sanctions
trump told the crowd in the fundraiser
i'd say that's pretty smart
he's taking over a country really a vast
vast location a great piece of land with
lots of people and is just walking right
in
now obviously it's going to be harder to
walk you right in and the sanctions are
going to be more than two dollars so
this is a little
in a sense you know he was using dated
information when he made his opinion
but
i don't disagree with his opinion do you
who who would disagree with the opinion
under the assumption
that putin could just walk in and take
over the country now that turns out not
to be true
it's going to be way harder than putin
might have imagined
but if your assumption was that it was
an easy easy takeover
which a lot of people thought in the
beginning thought it would take two days
if you have that assumption then it
would be
smart but evil
to do this
wouldn't you say
it's not nobody asked trump if he was if
putin is evil
right ask him the question
mr trump you said you think putin is
smart
do you think he's also evil
if he if trump says no he's fine
not only is he smart
but he's completely moral and ethical
too well then i think you'd have some
good complaints about trump
but
if trump says yeah he's making smart
moves
based on the information he has but he's
also evil
then that's not too far from what people
thought
a week ago
today i think i'll bet trump would
revise his opinion today
i'll bet host of today trump would say
you know this doesn't look so smart
anymore because he's not going to get
he's not going to get ukraine on the
cheap
so i'd like to hear an update on trump's
opinion based on new information
here's another for the trump was right
all along file do you remember the
saudi arabia and the
prince
crown prince allegedly
um
order the assassination of
khashoggi and the world said trump
why are you not coming harder on saudi
arabia why are you not pushing harder on
saudi arabia do you remember what i said
at the time
when trump was not pushing hard on saudi
arabia
i said
that's the right play
because basically now saudi or saudi
arabia owns you owes you a favor
that's how it works
you do somebody a favor that was a
pretty big one
basically trump not going hard in saudi
arabia for the khashoggi thing that was
a favor
it felt like it to me at the time it
felt like it was a personal favor
and i think trump collected
not only did he collect by getting the
abraham accords through
one of the you know greatest diplomatic
accomplishment accomplishments of all
time
but
now saudi arabia
is uh
let's see
um
how do i lose that story they're talking
about maybe being an ally with israel
someday so the crown prince is actually
saying you know
maybe maybe someday we should be
thinking more about israel as an ally
i think i think trump played this
exactly right
now the murder of khashoggi may have
been a horrible brutal thing that nobody
can individually be in favor of of
course
but if you were playing the the real
politic thing where you know it's a
dirty world
i think trump played the dirty world
just right
am i wrong
don't don't you think that trump played
the dirty world you know where nothing's
perfect and there are killers in the
world and it's just not a clean world
i think he played it right because he
ended up with saudi arabia
largely
where we want them to be
in terms of allies in terms of how they
would treat israel in the future
especially
i don't know i i would say that this is
one of trump's greatest moves and will
never be recognized as such
he'll probably be criticized
for not
you know not being harder on saudi
arabia at the same time
to me it looks clear that was the right
move in retrospect
all right
do you remember the tragic story of the
stanford stock soccer star a young woman
katie meyer
who died
and initially there was no information
on how she died
didn't everybody think that was a
vaccination death
because on social media
there was this you know this indication
sort of a hint
oh and then suddenly there were all
these stories about
all the athletes dying from vaccinations
which is all debunked by the way
there is no excess athletes dying from
vaccinations that's completely debunked
but it turns out we get an update and
she died of suicide
so
um
you know it's it's twice as tragic
if it's suicide i guess
and you think about this this is
somebody who had everything
she was healthy
she was at stanford
she was a soccer star
we we've got a problem in this world
with uh
mental health that's
as big as you think that problem is is
probably bigger than you think
like i think mental health is a giant
problem
you probably think it's a giant problem
too but however big you think it is
i think it's maybe five times that like
i don't think we're even close
to appreciating the mental health
problem that's
that's a bigger pandemic than the
pandemic
all right here's some
uk updates that i found interesting the
second biggest oil company i think cnn
was reporting this
luck oil
has called for an end of the war no no
they're not directly criticizing putin
that would be dangerous but it
apparently is noteworthy that they're
calling for an end to the violence
without you know blaming anybody
because apparently the value of their
stock has lost 99 of its value
essentially
every public company in russia is
worthless now
literally
literally worthless
meaning nobody would buy it
now i guess i guess there's some you
know
big companies in america are going to
gamble on some of the
some of the depressed assets but that's
just a gamble that's not really an
investment
you could call it an investment if it's
part of a big portfolio i'll give you
that though
um
but really
a russian company maybe all of them have
lost 99 of their value
now do you think that the russian public
is now unaware
that putin's got them in a little
trouble
i think these sanctions are going to
work way better than all the experts
predicted
so so far the experts told us
that putin would just walk into ukraine
in two days into kiev
expert the military experts have been
100 wrong am i right
i don't believe there were any military
experts saying oh it's going to be a
long slog
i don't recall seeing that once did you
did any any notable experts say
russia is going to get bogged down there
i don't remember seeing it
somebody says yes
there might have been
it's being said now of course and now
it's being said but before the actual
invasion
how many military experts said that they
were going to get bogged down the way
they are
besides me
i mean i said it
so i think the military experts were
largely completely wrong
so far
although i suspect they're gonna be
right about
russia
flattening ukraine unfortunately
um
so i i think um
i think putin is going to be losing the
persuasion war even within russia
because once you do this much damage to
the economy and i guess i guess even the
oil and energy segment in russia that
was carved out to be free of the
sanctions
nobody even wants to touch the part
that's carved out because they figure it
won't stay carved out
which is a good play right they're
thinking it's too risky
to even deal with russia on the stuff
that's not illegal because it might be
illegal later
that would be a wise risk management
decision
um
so rt russia today
which is basically a russian propaganda
site
which full disclosure i have appeared on
uh
back in
probably
2016 or 17 maybe
now at the time i didn't know it was a
you know russian propaganda
but i was just doing everybody's
propaganda i also appeared on cnn
which i also think is propaganda
so i've appeared on msnbcrt
cnn
and as long as they showed my interview
without editing which they did because
it was live
i'll appear almost anywhere
in fact i think i would
i probably would
i think i would appear on russia state
media
if they invited me
as long as they showed my live interview
because i get to say what i get to say
i think i'd do that
so
scott adams media
is it a media or am i using them
for my own purposes because remember
it's my opinion it's not their opinion
i wouldn't be going on their show to
give them their opinion i'd be giving my
opinion
why can't i give my opinion anywhere i
want
um apparently elon musk agrees with me
because he's been asked by several
nations
to block russian propaganda on the
starlink network
and elon musk says
sorry not going to happen unless it's at
gunpoint
because he's a free speech absolutist
and i respect that opinion especially if
you're if you've got a
network that carries traffic you should
be a free speech absolutist
so i respect that even though it has its
own set of costs i guess
anyway
paul joseph watson tweets this ironic
that rt is being banned for their
propaganda
when pretty much all of the legacy media
is just running one fake story after
another about ukraine
am i right
i think mike cernovich is doing the best
job of calling out the media for running
just pure ukrainian propaganda like all
the stories of the the 13 people on the
island that was fake the the ghost of
kiev the the ace fighter pilot who's
shooting down all the russian jets never
happened
complete fabrication
so
most of what you're hearing from ukraine
is pure
and our legacy media is just reporting
it like it's true
so
where do you draw the line
between you know honest mistakes are
they
you know which part of our media is just
uh
carrying water for the cia
some of them
it certainly looks to me like the cia is
directly managing
some parts of our media right now it
looks like it
i mean i don't i don't see the mechanism
but it looks like it you know the the
output looks like it
anyway it's a good question
who decides who is uh propaganda and
what is not when all of it it looks like
propaganda
uh also speaking of cernovich he points
out and this is always a good thing to
look for
all right we're in the fog of war
so you expect and you accept
that there'll be lots of mistakes made
in the reporting correct
we we we get
that a lot of the early reporting is
just going to be totally wrong
but
we also
sort of uncritically accept
that they're just mistakes
but as
mike cerdovich points out
why do the mistakes always seem to go in
one direction
meaning that
the stories that are incorrect turn out
to have been in pro-ukraine
is it a coincidence that all of the fake
news
is pro-ukraine
that would be a pretty big coincidence
wouldn't it now it's also possible
that that my assumption is wrong that
the fake news is not all pro-ukraine
maybe i just see it that way it could be
could be a perceptual thing so you know
throw that in the mix that's a
possibility too
scott how about is because russia is
evil
says
says the ukrainian troll
perhaps maybe allegedly
all right
a russian tv station that was um
essentially
decommissioned by russia
because i guess they were being too
independent about the war they were they
were already suspended their operations
but i guess they had one final broadcast
and they pretended that the entire staff
was you know resigning on air
to protest
protest the war basically so i guess
they all got up and and resigned on live
tv in russia
that's pretty impactful now it didn't
mean anything because they'd already
been suspended
so
wasn't wasn't any work to do anyway
but i think that's pretty meaningful do
you think the message is getting through
to the russian public
i think the the impact on the economy
and stuff like this
probably is starting to get through
but i'll bet you you can't reach 50
percent of the russian public
about 50 percent of the russian public
is impervious
to any
propaganda
let's say fighting
that they're just going to believe the
russian
the russian side
and there's nothing you can do about it
and if and how much support does putin
need within russia to
keep control
i don't know the answer that
but
if 50
are going to support him no matter what
because he can control the propaganda
i don't know that's probably enough to
hang on
i think he could hang on with 50 popular
support
because keep in mind
if russia does get full control of
ukraine
the russian public or some part of it
may consider this a success
what do you think
i'm going to say that 50 percent this is
just my impression it's not based on any
science or anything my guess is that
fifty percent of the russian public at
least
this would be my low number
fifty percent will will decide that
putin succeeded and russia
was justified and that it was a good war
and a good outcome
i say at least 50 percent will believe
that because putin can control the
narrative that well
now
um let's talk about some more of the the
fake news and the narrative
so greta tuttenberg
did a little selfie today holding a
handmade sign in support of ukraine
now how much balls does it take
to be greta tunberg
and publicly take a selfie saying you're
favoring ukraine
because although she is not
single-handedly responsible
she is the biggest name
in favor of uh reducing our energy
security
i'm not making that up i don't think
that's a
i don't believe that that's a any kind
of a weird interpretation of events i
think that's just straightforward
she's the voice of climate change
climate change is the thing which
created
energy insecurity because the green
stuff can't grow fast enough
it doesn't work all the time you know if
the wind does blow
the sun isn't out
so greta at least as a
as a symbol
she is really the cause of the ukraine
war because if russia didn't have this
much control over
energy
they never would have been emboldened to
do what they're doing
so
how much balls does it take for her to
say she's in favor of ukraine she is
closer to the cause of the war than than
the solution
now again you know i'm using some
hyperbole you recognize that right
you know ukraine wasn't caused by one
thing
you know it requires you know putin's
brain and lots of other things too
so cnn is running a opinion piece by
douglas london who is uh
decades
in foreign
foreign experience in the cia
and he's talking about putin
and the start of his article is putin
the emperor with no clothes
now on principle alone i almost didn't
read this article
because i'm going to add
the emperor has no close to my empty npc
statements
that's like soylent green
hey that's like the matrix
it looks like wag the dog is happening
and then i'm gonna add the emperor has
no clothes
these are all the things that you say if
you don't have anything to add
whatsoever
there's just
nothing to add
all right but
i'm guessing that
maybe the editors had something to do
with the title because the article
itself was pretty good
and uh douglas london's take is that
putin is not crazy
not crazy
and that
the problem is he's terribly misinformed
by his inner circle who don't want to
tell them the truth
do you buy that
do you buy that
putin is perfectly sane
the only problem is all of his
information about what's practical to do
and what the situation is is skewed by
his inner circle
because they just will agree with him
like sick offense
i don't agree with that
i don't agree with that
i don't believe that
putin's sources of information are just
as sick offense
do you believe that
you know i
i don't think it's so far out of the
scott is a paid corporate shell
bill scott says scott is a paid
corporate shill
have you been paying attention to my
career at all
have you heard of dilbert
it's a it's a popular comic
it's not really that complementary to
management
and to corporate interests
just saying
anyway
um i don't think i buy that putin is
only misinformed by his own sick offense
he i think is probably his own opinions
that are misinformed meaning that he's
got the input he just processes it
differently that would be my guess but
again we're all guessing nobody knows
what putin's really thinking
i watched a little bit of putin's
address to russia i think it was
yesterday
in which he was doing a televised
address giving them an update on stuff
and
if you look at putin's face and his body
language
he's he's having a tough time
now some of it could be just warface you
know if if you're the person who's
killing thousands of people every day
imagine imagine waking up
you're putin and you know that today you
will kill thousands of people that
didn't need to die
how does that feel
you know i think i could be a war
president if if my country had been
attacked
like i could rationalize sending people
to defend the country even if they some
of them died
but how do you rationalize a war of
choice
because it was choicey i think he had a
choice
and he just decides to the thousands of
people will die
in his own country you know his own
citizens he'll send out there to die
how do you live with that
i don't know
um
but to me he looked uh like he's not in
his best mental state
he looks like a person who knows he's
losing
again we can't we can't read his mind so
everybody's just guessing about putin
but my take on him this is just you know
the
totality of my life experience
is that he had a face that looks like he
knows he's wrong
he shouldn't have been there and that
he's going to lose that's what his face
said to me again just an impression
don't put too much
in that
um
joel pollock points out
that uh you know there there are calls
for the biden administration
to get behind the idea that uh
that putin's a war criminal
um
but okay so as joel says
a reporter at the press conference uh
correctly pointed out that the biden
administration's empty threats to accuse
russia of war crimes
that they're empty threats when the when
the international criminal court does
not have jurisdiction over non-member
russia and the us
especially for war crimes committed with
non-member ukraine
so basically there's no entity that
could
you know deem him a war criminal and
make it a stick
but i don't think that's the important
part i don't think that we're talking
about
him being a war criminal
because it matters if somebody
designates them that
i think it's just persuasion
if you can make everybody talk about
whether he is or is not a war criminal
or better yet
talk about whether some international
group will designate him one
that's making you think past the sale
if what you're talking about is if
there's a legal entity to designate in a
war criminal you've kind of already
uncritically accepted that he's a war
criminal and the only question is
whether there's an entity to label him
it's persuasion
it's all persuasion
so it's good persuasion if you're if
you're on the team that wants uh putin
to look bad it's good persuasion the war
criminal thing is really sticky
i i think it's really sticky
all right nato said it won't give air
cover as you know to ukraine which is
essentially telling um putin he can have
ukraine
am i right
when nato says we definitely won't do
air cover as opposed to saying well
we're considering it
suppose they said
we don't say what we're going to do
militarily
could they have done that could nato
have said we don't we don't tell anybody
what our military plans are
but instead they said nope absolutely
we're not going to do any uh air support
is that the right thing to do
i don't know
but to me it sounds like they just told
putin he can have ukraine there's
nothing to stop him um
now a number of people said that uh
here's what the experts say now remember
the experts
the experts said that putin could
take uh ukraine in 48 hours
why do you think that the only reason
that uh putin thought he could take
ukraine in 48 hours if he did we don't
know that but if he did do you think
it's because his sycophants would not
give him the right information
or was it because every single military
expert on every side
said it would take two days
and and so cnn's running an article
that says he's getting a disinformation
or an opinion piece saying he's probably
getting his information from just the
sycophants and he doesn't know what's
going on
but suppose he did
suppose putin was watching all the
western press and he knew exactly what
cnn and all the military experts said
what would they have been saying
they would have agreed with his sick
offense
if putin had the information outside of
his
uh his little unit of agreers
he would have seen the same message that
he could take ukraine in two days
i'm not wrong about that right
so why would we think that his his uh
small band of advisors are the problem
when they're saying the same thing
everybody else was saying
presumably again we don't know for sure
people are telling me that this is also
what the experts say and confirm this
for me confirm that the experts do say
this the military experts say
that the size of the military that
putin seems to be putting into ukraine
would be nowhere near nowhere near
what it would take to hold the country
even if you if you conquered it to
occupy it
i completely disagree
do you know why
because putin can control propaganda
completely
if you can control propaganda completely
you don't need an occupation force
you just do it with persuasion
now
i'm waiting to see the first person to
say something that that i'm going to
criticize go i say
that putin can occupy ukraine
successfully
with nothing but persuasion because
he'll control the
information
now
come on i'm waiting i'm waiting for the
criticism i know it's coming
come on
come on
why isn't somebody saying why couldn't
he do it in afghanistan or why couldn't
the soviet union
where is that
why are why are you telling me why
couldn't they do it in the soviet union
and when they were in afghanistan they
didn't have the internet
and the mujahideen are not on twitter
so you can't you can't hold afghanistan
with persuasion because you don't have
the communication channel
there's no way to hold the ukraine
there's no way to hold afghanistan with
just persuasion you would have to have
an occupation force that was big enough
but ukraine
do you know what the ukrainian people
will hear
like within within a week of putin
owning all the communications and
media in ukraine which seems likely
the ukrainian people are going to hear
you probably were not aware how many
nazis were in your government before we
came in here
am i right
and they'll say it over and over again
and they'll show you videos and lots of
images and scary things that they saved
him from
you don't think that half of ukraine
which is about all it would take to hold
ukraine probably you don't think that
half of ukraine could be convinced that
maybe the ukraine was on the wrong side
yeah that's very possible
practical and doable
now remember
persuasion doesn't get everybody all the
time
it's not that kind of a weapon
but you can get half the people reliably
on any message
if the government is behind the
messaging you can get half of the people
to agree with just about anything
and that's probably enough to hold the
country
or at least reduce the net
reduce the size of an occupation force
so
here's my uh disagreement with the
experts summarized
that the size of your occupation force
is directly related to the quality of
your persuasion if your persuasion is
high your occupation force could be
small
and vice versa
so they're they're what do you call the
substitutes
they're not perfect substitutes but
they're substitutes
all right um
um
i just got a weird question by
by text
and the answer is no
to the question by text all right
um you're dismissing the rage of loss of
country family and friends yes the
ukrainian citizens
are not going to be happy with putin
and that's going to last
but what i'm saying is that
there will be enough people who
who
are persuaded to the russian point of
view
that it reduces the amount of occupation
force they need
that's all
and and if you get the right people in
charge of you know the security
apparatus
then ukraine's own security apparatus
takes care of a lot of the internal
conflict
is that an official prediction it's an
official let me say statement of
how the world works
so the statement of how the world works
is that uh the better the persuasion the
smaller the occupation force you need
so that's
i guess that's not a prediction that's a
statement
but
i will say
it's not a prediction but in my opinion
it's possible for putin to hold you
ukraine
without a gigantic occupation force so
that's all i'll say is possible that
doesn't mean you'll do it
because the crushing sanctions are
pretty crushing
so you know there's a lot of variables
in play here
all right uh why is russia focusing on
ukraine's nuclear sites
i have a question
that i need
mark schneider or somebody who's smart
about nuclear to answer for me
i've not seen anybody say the following
that russia might be concerned that
ukraine would get a hold of a dirty bomb
can you make a dirty bomb
if you had access to a nuclear power
plant and let's say you were all on the
same team
and you went there and said hey nuclear
power plant you're on the side of
ukraine
so are we
is there any way we can get some of your
dirty stuff to make a dirty bomb
somebody says you could do it from spent
fuel rods
now here's the question
why is nobody reported that
let's get let's go back to the mike
cernovich question
which is why does all the reporting
coincidentally favor ukraine
is that a coincidence
now
it could be that the only reason that uh
ukraine that russia wants to take over
the nuclear sites is they want to
prevent a false flag
what if russia had heard
that ukraine might blow one of its own
nuclear sites which would be the worst
case scenario but imagine they would
melt down their own site
to blame russia
and that would basically turn the world
against russia till the end of time
if a nuclear site goes down in ukraine
and russia gets blamed
that's a different situation isn't it
now would somebody in ukraine do
something that evil
well i don't know if your whole country
is being threatened and you're on a kill
list you put me on a kill list let me
let me say this clearly
if you put my name on a kill list
i might take out a nuclear facility to
get myself off it
now i'd hope that the people who maybe
did this false flag this is all
speculative there's no evidence of any
of this but i would hope that anybody
who did take down the nuclear site you
know got people out of there
so so nobody died directly from it
but yeah yeah if i were in a government
that was on a kill list and i had maybe
48 hours to live
and i thought maybe i had to do
something drastic
i i would consider taking on a nuclear
site in my own country
because remember the nuclear sites
aren't going to help them
because the russia is going to turn off
the lights until russia has control
so they don't need any nuclear sites
they're not working
but if they can use it to change the
course of the war or get nato involved
or something
i can imagine i can imagine that russia
has some valid reasons for wanting to
control those sites
that are not
bad now did you see the story that
the russians had put explosives around
one of the sites so they would blow the
nuclear site if
i don't know if something went wrong
do you believe that story
do you believe that the russian army has
orders
to blow a nuclear site in ukraine under
any conditions
that sounds like really fake news to me
i don't see any argument
that the russian
army or the russian government or putin
could possibly
have any benefit from blowing up a
nuclear site in ukraine just not
possible
right
so i think that's a fake news story that
russia was putting bombs around the
nuclear site
now again like all of these things if i
say something with a great confidence
those of you who know me well enough
you should know if i say something like
that and it sounds like
confident
that a hundred percent of everything you
say about this ukrainian situation is
iffy
can we agree on that
i think the only thing we know is that
there's some kind of a war going on
after that it's all just it's just
 after that
so if i look confident just know that
that's just a mannerism it's not what's
happening in my head about anything
all right
um
now they're saying that zelinski has
survived three
assassination attempts there are these
assassination squads you know they're
chetans
uh but they they've all been thwarted
because the
plucky and highly capable uh
ukrainian security uh got tipped off
possibly by somebody in russia because
even russia doesn't like this they say
and so the the death squads were
thwarted and
eliminated how much of that story do you
believe
i believe none of it
i believe none of it
there's probably not a single thing
about this story that's true
except the general thing that russia
might want is zelinski dead
um so don't believe any of that
it might be true
but i would say the credibility of the
source is just zero
it's just zero
am i right
do you all agree with the following
statement that's possibly true possibly
true
but the source that told you it's true
zero credibility zero
in fact every lie that we've heard it
came from the source
all right
let's talk about something else
so remember i was uh
i guess we were all asking the question
why isn't ukraine if it still has
military assets and some
some assets in the sky
and drones
why are they not wiping out that stalled
russian
column
that was 40 miles long and they're not
going anywhere
and
i had speculated with my total lack of
military
experience
that the smartest thing the ukrainians
could do
is just pick off the supply trucks
you know pick off the gas and and food
supplies
and that's it
and just let the convoy be trapped
because they can't do anything they're
just gonna
starve to death and so we saw a report
and again remember 100 of the news and
of ukraine is sketchy
i'll just tell you what the report is
but don't automatically assume that i
think it's true i'm just telling you
what it is
that apparently the uh the report is
that the ukrainians have
uh special forces
that have been trained by america
the
the belief there that their special
forces are quite good and the special
forces have been targeting
primarily the rear of the column
to get the supply trucks and
successfully
so they're sending out the the best of
their special forces and just picking
off the supply trucks
and they're doing it successfully now
that's the report but it's in the
context of only propaganda right so we
don't really know if that's even
happening if if we're being honest we
don't know if anything like that's
really happening but that's the report
now
those of you who would like to make fun
of my lack of military expertise
i would point out that that's what i
would have done and i said that publicly
before we saw a report that that's what
they're actually doing
can can you back me on that
the i want to make sure that i really
did say that in public do you remember
hearing it
okay so i'm getting some confirmation
that people did hear that yeah all right
so remember
every every time that you're saying but
scott the military experts blah blah
just remember that i beat the military
experts
about how effective russia would be in
48 hours
i was i was better than the military
experts and on the supply truck column
my theory of how to address it is
exactly what's reported they're doing
now i also have
a
i guess a speculation or prediction
that the turkish-made drones
that are flying over ukraine and
attacking russia
someday we're going to find out that
ukrainians were not piloting those
which military expert is telling you
that
i mean they can't really they can't tell
you that
but there's no way in hell
that we sent a bunch of gazillion dollar
uh you know expensive drones over there
and we told the ukrainians hey
you know take an hour to learn how to
use this thing
because there's no way the ukrainians
had enough trained drone operators
there's no way and even if they did
wouldn't you want the best drone
operators on this job
i mean i i think they did they probably
just shuffled some paperwork and said
all right you were working for nato
yesterday but on paper you're working
for ukraine now we fire you and then the
guy the same chair just kept running
running the drones that's what i think
i don't i don't think that
um
the ukraine military
built a drone operating center
that is successfully operating from
ukrainian territory
well let me ask it this way
do you believe
that the drones are being operated from
the ground
and that the ground source is in you in
ukraine today
do you believe that
do you believe that the ground operation
for the drones is in ukraine
somebody says yes
that would be the worst place to put it
you don't think the russians could find
that thing
i i can't believe
that there would still be a central
ground operation place for the the
drones if russia is in ukraine and has
probably some reasonably good
intelligence
can they up can they find where the
signal is coming from
they can can't they
don't you think
somebody says no way somebody says no
way that they could find where the the
source of the signal is
is there somebody who is smart enough to
know
if remember elon musk just warned
that the starlink terminals could be
located
by somebody who's you know got the right
equipment and that they could be bombed
if you can if you can find a starling
terminal now i get that the startling
terminal is not designed to be
military-grade security i get that
but something tells me if a signal is
going into space from a place
you can't find the source of the signal
especially when you've turned off the
electricity to pretty much all of
ukraine
couldn't you just turn off all of the
electricity in your crane
and then you'd find basically one signal
that's still working
and that would be the drone operators
because they'd have a you know
their own source of energy probably
somebody says satellites
well yeah i mean the satellites are
involved
but there's still a ground source
human who's running it right
somebody in the comments says i could do
it in five minutes with equipment i
already own
so there's somebody saying they could
detect
the ground-based operators of the drones
with just equipment he owns
assuming he's an engineer
all right
so
there is a thought that the russian
influence campaign on the internet has
dried up
because their source of funding is
unavailable because of the sanctions
do you believe that
do you believe that the russian
influence just sort of stopped because
their money source for paying the trolls
dried up
well i saw a
senior editor at pc world mark hackman
he showed two screenshots of
showing facebook posts you know the top
posts from a week ago and then now
and the implication is that a week ago
the russian influence campaign was in
full swing
but now because of the sanctions maybe
not
and if you look at the the list of what
the top
the top sources were
it changed
i would say i wouldn't put any real
faith in that analysis whatsoever
because i i think that what trends
changes for lots of reasons
so i would i would say low credibility
on that
but
it made me wonder
where all of my trolls went
because i feel like a week ago i had a
whole bunch of
no picture in the profile trolls
that were
pro-russia-ish
and
i don't see any of them today
now it could be the nature of my tweets
right so
remember i'm
this is not a scientific study this is
me being biased and trying to recognize
a pattern that may not be there today
um
yeah don't no feed the trolls
so
is it really russian trolls yes that's a
good question
but
i just know that they seem to have
disappeared
so here's the question to you if any of
you feel that the russian troll bots
have been bothering you did they
disappear from you
somebody says it's the weekend oh yeah
maybe
maybe maybe
maybe they don't work on weekends
you know what's funny is that that's
actually a pretty good hypothesis
but you know it wasn't the weekend that
stopped i think it stopped a few days
ago
maybe it's cia bots i don't know maybe
all right
that
is my fascinating uh
take um i'll just note that
are all of you following ian bremmer
about the ukraine situation
uh i'm finding him the best source of
you know quick updates on things
as well as framing it in in productive
ways
and uh he he's got an article he's uh i
think he wrote or referred to
on g0
i guess he wrote it that uh
um he's thinking that the it'll be a
pyrrhic victory in other words that uh
putin might succeed in conquering
ukraine but it will be the end of russia
or the end of putin in terms of their
current level of prestige and influence
and even economics
how many of you would agree with his
prediction which is agrees with my
prediction at this point as well how
many of you agree that uh putin will get
control of ukraine
but he will be really sorry that he did
let me see your yeses and nose it's too
early yeah anybody who says too early i
automatically agree with that
he will get half that's a reasonable
yeah he'll get half as a reasonable
thing i don't think he'll stop at half
but
because the other half isn't hard is it
the other half is you just surround it
you just surround it and take your time
don't you
um
i think he's doing the he's doing the
hard half first isn't he even though
they're more russian so that makes more
sense but it's harder to conquer part i
believe
um
yeah now i was looking at uh
a comment by andres beckhouse who was
noting that both ukraine and russia are
aging populations
and if you put together two aging
populations and
uh
you know maybe maybe things are not
looking good for russia in the long in
the long term
but
i do agree with trump's real estate
instinct
can we agree on one thing
that trump probably understands real
estate
does everybody agree on that
he understands real estate and his take
on ukraine was almost a real estate take
wasn't it
if you could get ukraine
for two dollars worth of sanctions
you've got some good real estate
it's almost the way it's almost exactly
how trump is describing it as good real
estate you get good real estate that's
worth a lot for a little bit of
sanctions now he was wrong about the
little bit of sanctions
i think the sanctions have way more bite
than initially reported
scott's still coping
i can't tell if that's a joke
elaine morris says scott is still coping
i think i'm going to add coping
to
soil and green the matrix the emperor
has no clothes
and you're coping
i think that you're coping is probably a
sign of cognitive dissonance if you're
using that word because if you're trying
to explain how somebody else is saying
something that doesn't make sense to you
if it doesn't make sense to you
it could be the problems on your side
and one way to know that the problem is
probably on your side is if you think
the other person is just coping which
doesn't really mean anything
this is real news
and star wars references of course
isn't coping a stage
yeah sign of grief i suppose
um
russia paralympic athletes thrown out of
competition in china
why
all right
so
this ladies and gentlemen
was the greatest live stream of all time
possibly we'll be able to top it
tomorrow but i don't know pretty high
bar
um let me ask you something in the
comments
i worry that everybody talking about
ukraine is just gonna end up saying the
same stuff as everybody else
am i saying anything different than
everybody else is saying
this is a real question are you getting
any value added out of this at all
because i can't tell
um
yeah you know i i think i'm going to get
the same pushback pretty soon
as i did with kovid which is you know
the topic you just
you can't mind the same topic forever
but at the moment uh is unfortunately
interesting
unfortunately interesting
what's this
uh hedging scott is always hedging his
predictions he said russia will win and
spends the rest of show praising ukraine
military and sanctions
really
all right is this an npc comment
the npc's can only handle the binary
something's either a yes or no as soon
as you get past that people can't handle
it so here's what i think i'm doing
i'm predicting that russia will control
ukraine
and i'm predicting that the ukrainian
military will do will do a surprisingly
good job
of defending
but ultimately will be overwhelmed
because putin has the advantage now that
as soon as he turns off the media he can
do anything he wants there won't be any
pictures
right as soon as there's no pictures and
no reporting on the ground
putin can just level everything
and he's almost there
so there's no inconsistency between
saying putin will control the country
ukraine
and also saying that it's going to be
really really hard and might take russia
down in the long run those are all
consistent it's the same same prediction
what about china helping russia
china i think is brutally
self-interested
which will work to our advantage
you know we keep saying oh
russia is going to be saved by china
do you know what is the last thing that
putin wants
to be saved by china
literally
the last thing he wants do you know why
china doesn't help you for free
am i right
china is only going to help if it's good
for china period
and i think china's going to expect some
you know a little something in return
so by the time china is directly helping
russia which i don't think is going to
happen in the real over direct way
um by the time they do that china is
putting themselves out there
pretty far
and they don't do that
the only way they would put themselves
out which is would be a complete
difference in how they've handled
their non-involvement up till now
not just non-involvement in ukraine
but china likes to stay uninvolved in
all of this stuff it's like really
really central to their their main
philosophies don't get involved in other
people's wars
pretty good idea
so if they did
get involved even on the financial part
to like save russia
i think they would be taking a big favor
in return and i don't know what that
would be but it's not something putin's
want to get going to want to give them
so
yeah i i don't think
that's how they win russia doesn't win
by getting controlled by china
um
i just saw the best comment i've seen so
far
on locals somebody said they just ate a
pound of bacon
good for you
it was actually the best best comment of
the day
uh mass formation and zelensky yes yes
zelensky has hypnotized the western
world
and uh i have to say
that i would like to you know thank some
of the independent voices on twitter for
literally waking me up on him
because i i fell for it pretty hard in
the first days
i kind of fell for the zielinski
you know plucky hero story
uh but then as cernovich is doing the
best job of
you know keeping us sane about that
uh he points out that it can't be that
all the stories go in one direction
you know and it's just obviously
propaganda at this point so i see two
corrupt
two corrupt governments fighting each
other
i'm not entirely
i'm not even i don't even care which
corrupt government wins frankly
i only care about the people
is that fair
is that a moral and ethical
place to be
that you have two corrupt governments
i don't really care which corrupt
government wins
but i do care about what happens to the
citizens so you know that pushes you in
one direction over the other
um
now let me ask you this if you wanted to
design
and escape
let's say an escape hatch for putin
so that he could back down and still
save something what would it look like
let me suggest a trump-like way to
approach this
somewhere behind the scenes assuming we
can get to putin indirectly i'm sure we
can
it would be really interesting if the
united states was offering a complete
amnesty program
with
catches
a complete amnesty program and it would
look like this
we'll take all of the sanctions off of
russia
if they turn away from china
what just happened when i said that
what happened to your brain
do you see it now this entire thing
could be to put putin in the position to
uh
to join our side instead of china
because that's the big ask
because remember china is not
sanctioning putin so china loses that
leverage they don't have anything to
take away they have only ways to help
them which may not even be good for
china
so
if if putin gets to the point of
complete desperation
which seems likely at this point
not guaranteed
but it seems likely
that putin will reach a point of near
desperation what will be his options
you know go into exile and never happen
use a nuclear weapon
that's not going to help him
because there would be a decapitation
strike immediately
don't you think
if if putin used a nuclear weapon
we would go directly for the
decapitation strike probably with
nuclear
right
i mean that's just a given
so he can't really use the nuclear
thing without dying for sure you can't
really go into exile that's not going to
happen right so his options are just
going to shrink and shrink he could try
to ride it down but then the oligarch's
going to be after him because they're
losing all their boats
apparently i don't know how many stories
have there been so far of oligarchs
losing their yachts
to or am i hearing the same story twice
um
i'm seeing somebody say it's the most
bizarre thing i've said in the week
now if we push putin to the point where
his only choices are to preside over the
the destruction of russia
or
to turn from china and be
you know more of an ally to the united
states which would require a whole host
of changes i mean it would be a big
realignment
but he could do it
because as i've told you a million times
putin doesn't really have any reason to
be our enemy and we don't have a reason
to be theirs except we've decided that
we are
we've sort of just decided we're enemies
that's not a reason to be an enemy
in in terms of what's good for
russia in the long term and the united
states in the long term
it is to be allies
who would disagree with that
that because you know china is the
the emerging long-term
threat i guess you could say it that way
i say
i think that the arc of history
is bending unambiguously toward a
russian and american alliance and europe
russia europe
america will be allied
how many of you think that's true
i'm seeing mostly yeses which is weird
i you know what what are the odds that
we would be so
so at odds with russia
and then i could ask the public here in
america
do you think that in the long run we'll
be allies with russia
and i got nearly i don't know 95 or 100
percent of people said yes no not not
100 i'm seeing some no's now
i know i think it's inevitable i think
all of the forces are pushing us in that
direction
all right
um
somebody says in the comments we could
we should because we're white guys
america isn't a bunch of white guys
anymore
it's 20 22.
america is
finally the melting pot that it was
always trying to be but now we're
actually a melting pot in terms of
numbers
i know you don't like the melting pot
analogy but i still like it
um
russia's uh
definitely not a bunch of white guys
somebody says
um
predict will the ukraine special forces
uh succeed in starving the russian
column
uh starving is uh
too big of a word
meaning that i don't believe that the
russian soldiers will actually die of
starvation
i do believe that they have made the
column at least temporarily useless
i think they took him out of the fight
so i do think they'll take them out of
the fight
and continue to take them out of the
fight
until russia has like total control and
you know even over the special forces i
guess
should we stock up on food who's we in
the west i don't think so
um
or besiege yeah
all right that is all for now
and uh
he does whatever a dug until who's that
all right stock up on toilet paper i
don't think we need to
complete nonsense people say
all right all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you tomorrow youtube
