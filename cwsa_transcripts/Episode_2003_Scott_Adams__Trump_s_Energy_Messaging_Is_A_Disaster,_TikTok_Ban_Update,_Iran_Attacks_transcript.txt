football
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization once again
the best thing you've ever done for
yourself showing up here now I can't
guarantee that this will be the best
thing that happened to you today
but there's about an 80 chance 80 chance
and if you'd like to take it up to 85
chance all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker Chelsea Stan at canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip go
oh yeah
that's good stuff well over on locals
we're gonna go private
but you can watch us on YouTube all you
want except for the good stuff after the
show that's only for the subscribers
well have I ever told you this way to
predict the future
best way to predict the future is the
best story usually wins if you ever
heard me say that the best story
so for example if there's an aging
athlete who comes back for one last
chance to win the Super Bowl that he's
never won before
if that's like the best story
it'll probably happen
right so
the Australian Open tennis tournament
just concluded what was the best story
well the best story if you recall if you
don't watch Tennis I'll tell you one of
the top layers in the world I don't know
if he's number one but he has been
number one off and on uh Novak Djokovic
he was not allowed to play in the in the
Australian Open last year because he was
unvaccinated
this year he was allowed to play
what was the best story
oh did you regain number one by winning
the tournament
that's the best story the best story
would be Novak Djokovic winning the
Australian Open
yesterday Novak Djokovic won the
Australian Open
now that's not the weird part
you know what the weird part is
his first name
no vax
novax
I mean it's you know Novak but really
his name is novax
and he didn't get vaccinated anyone in
Australian Open
you tell me that's not the best story
right
could could you not have predicted that
I did I did actually predict that in
advance but privately so I should have
said it out loud but every time you see
one of these where the best story is
really obvious you're like well that
would be the best story
then it happens and I think that there's
actually a mechanism for it
you know it could be the simulation is
causing our intentions to make it happen
but I feel as if everybody collectively
knows the best story
including the competitors
and I think it actually suppresses the
competitors
you know there's a like a psychological
mechanism where they too want the best
story to happen
because the best story is just as a hold
on your mind because you used to sing
the best story you know in fiction
so that's just a theory Wall Street
Journal is reporting that restaurants
are retooling to be more takeout
oriented some of them will be purely
taken
so you're going to have a purely Take
Out restaurant
more of them coming I mean it's not it's
not like that was just invented but
there'll be more of them coming now
here's what I always thought was the
best part about the pandemic if if you
can even say that the best part about
the pandemic is uh do you remember uh
Naval ravacon said early in the pandemic
he predicted that what the pandemic
would change
was mostly the rate of change
that the things that were going to
happen in the long run were still going
to happen just that would happen more
quickly because we would be scrambling
to re-engineer everything and one of the
things I think was badly in need of
re-engineering is food
have you ever thought about the
inefficiency of the food process
from the moment let's say a seed is
planted in a farmer's field
do you know how many people touch your
food before it gets to your mouth
it's like all kinds of steps to get it
to you know some distribution plays and
then it gets to the food distribution
place I guess the grocery store then it
gets on the Shelf you put it into your
cart you take it out of the cart you put
it on your uh on the you know the
cashier thing you pay for it you put it
back in the cart you take it out of the
cart you put it in your car you take it
out of your car you put it on your
counter you take it out of your bag and
put it in the refrigerator you take it
out of the refrigerator you take it out
of the package take it out of the
package put it in the oven take it out
of the oven put it on a plate take it
from the plate and put it in your mouth
the whole thing is a complete mess
nobody would design the system from
scratch you know just sort of evolved
that way with a free market
so
I for a long time I've been telling you
that the best
food distribution
system would look like the following
something very close to your home
like you could walk there in five
minutes
would be like a central cafeteria like a
college campus
and the central cafeteria would have a
wide variety of food that they just made
fresh so everything's fresh
just got made lots of variety and
because it because it's a captive
audience a little bit you know there's
you know they have that Monopoly if you
will it was pretty cheap
so it was cheap best food you could get
and the easiest food you could get they
solved every problem
solved every problem the only thing it
didn't solve
was we didn't have apps about you know
when I was in college if I had an app
where all I had to do was you know say
what I want to pick up and I just walk
over and pick it up I wouldn't have to
pay for a delivery so the whole doordash
I think doordash
might have a limited future
because I think people are going to
still be doing
takeout but I think they're going to get
it within five minutes of their house
so I think they're that you'll have all
these local sort of General cafeterias
here would be the mistake
I think the mistake would be
to have a a local takeout only that's
one ethnicity
like it's just Chinese takeout now
people will use that but the but
wouldn't you rather everybody in your
family can order from the cafeteria and
you just go pick it up
you don't want the well I don't like
Chinese food or I had it yesterday
if you're gonna if you're gonna order
once for a family you kind of want the
cafeteria
uh
so I think this is where it's going it's
going to be all use your app walk five
minutes and pick it up
that's what it's going to be with some
delivery option
uh but it's already happening looks like
all right here's some fake news from the
Democrats
fake news do you remember when the
Democrats were saying that the Georgia
voting laws and there have been some
recent changes we're going to
disenfranchise the Black American voters
do you remember that
oh it was practically a
second Holocaust
slavery all over again how could they
they were going to make it impossible
for black people to figure out how to
vote
so there was a recent survey
new poll asked black voters if they had
a poor experience cast in their ballot
and the number of black voters who said
they had a poor experience voting in
Georgia was uh
zero zero
have you ever seen a poll
where one of the main answers was Zero
zero now we're rounded to zero so it was
you know a little bit more than zero but
it rounded to zero
yeah I often tell you that on any poll
at least 25 percent of the respondents
are going to get the wrong answer
but this one was so clean
so obvious
so clear
so unambiguous
that a hundred percent of black
Americans who you would might imagine
you know being human like everybody else
you might imagine that they would feel a
little biased because we all do in our
own situations right we all have bias
don't you think that you could get more
than zero of them to at least imagine
they had a problem hard time
how do you even not imagine that maybe
it was harder than usual I mean the
level of certainty
that these Patriots
exhibited and I'm going to call them
patriots why
why do I call them patriots because
there wasn't anybody who was willing to
lie for political purposes
they found apparently a large body of
black voters of which basically none of
them were willing to lie for political
gain
have you ever seen better news than that
yeah now somebody says that you know
makes you suspicious of the poll doesn't
it yeah that does make you a little
suspicious of the poll
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna completely
change my take on this
you've completely changed my mind
there's no way that's true
there's no way that's credible all right
you win you win you got me
my first reaction was it was amazing
second reaction you have changed my
Minds I'm looking at your comments
you've totally changed my mind there
isn't any way that's true
there isn't any way that's true
right
and here I was all inspired that we'd
found a pocket of the best patriotic
Americans who just weren't willing to
lie for a political gain but there's no
there's no group of Americans like that
right well I guess it's double fake news
it's probably double fake news and it
really wasn't that hard to vote but
there's no way this survey is real I
can't believe it all right enough of
that
so Wall Street Journal has some good
reporting here on what's stopping The
Tick-Tock ban from happening as you know
Tick Tock is evil and
uh can control America because it's the
user interface that China can use to
change our opinions in America literally
that's not it not any kind of
exaggeration and
so as you know the Holly Holly has a uh
some legislation and spending but here's
a problem that I'd never heard of until
today
and how how in the world did I never
hear this until today
can you tell me if you heard this news
before today that the reason that
Trump tried and failed to get Tick Tock
banned was there something called the
Berman Amendment
it goes back to the Cold War
and the Berman Amendment says that you
don't want to censor International
Information
and the reason the reason was I think we
didn't want our information to be
censored by other people but also we
didn't want to be the sensors of other
countries
so it was the Berman Amendment
now apparently the Trump Administration
was not able to figure out a way around
it and so Tick Tock argued it and won
and won in court they said it's not
legal because the bourbon Amendment says
you can't do this so the Trump
Administration backed off
do you know how hard this was to solve
here's what the Holly Amendment did to
get past that oh so terrible problem
totally unsolvable problem right what
are you going to do what are you going
to do with this unsolvable problem of
the Berman Amendment well let me tell
you how clever
Holly is Josh Hawley now you never would
have figured this out
because we're you know just normal
people
but Josh Hawley apparently a genius
figured out how to get around the Berman
Act
his legislation says this will be a
narrow exception to the Berman Act
well who would have ever thought of that
who would have ever thought well why
don't we just include in the legislation
that this is an exception
how about that
now apparently nobody
I want to ask you for an exception to do
some swearing
because this really calls for it but I'm
not going to do it not going to do it
I'm not going to swear I will simply
state in the calmest possible way
that the Trump Administration
must have been deeply incompetent on
this issue
because it looks like the solution is as
simple as saying well how about we make
an exception to the Berman act and
here's why
that was not really hard to figure out
so
I can't give Trump a pass on that
can I
how in the world could I give him a pass
on that now maybe
maybe the Josh Hawley legislation won't
pass
and then you know then maybe the
argument is well you know it's not going
to pass if you put that in there but why
wouldn't it
the argument for not making that
exception is that other countries might
try to censor our information
stop laughing come on let me say it
again so you can have a good laugh with
the argument for not censoring
information coming into our country
from China
from China
is that other countries might try to you
know use as an excuse to ban some of our
information
yeah
that's actually what they're arguing
about
in the real world
actual adults are having that
conversation
let me tell you the conversation that's
not happening in China
oh we better not do anything with tick
tock
because we don't want to violate that
Berman act I mean it's not our it's not
our act or Amendment it's not our
Amendment but you know we don't want to
start something the last thing we'd want
to do in China is Ban some American
information
because you know then they might ban our
information
I mean really
are we seeing are we missing something
about the story
or or are politicians actually this
incapable
the the level of incompetence that this
exhibits
is almost hard to believe
like you could have a really low opinion
of Congress and still look at this and
say okay that's a new that's a new level
of incompetence I haven't seen that
before you know you've done it again
you've found done yourself
yeah we don't want China and Russia and
North Korea yeah we wouldn't want them
filtering the information we send to
their residents
God forbid that that should start
tomorrow
all right
so that's happening or not happening but
the good news is we'll all get to see
who is voting for China and who's voting
for the United States and Josh Hawley
here's another bit of uh
um fodder for you
the bourbon act unless I'm mistaken is
about information from other countries
information
Tick Tock is information
all you have to do is call it
entertainment
you're done
just say the Berman act talks about
information but this is specifically
about entertainment
so we would never block information but
we might Block Entertainment
that also has some information in it
so it's just words nothing you can't
change there's a company I saw an ad for
a company called pay Analytics
so they've got a new product I want you
to see if you can find
oh I don't know
yeah any potential problems with this
product
see if see if your Suspicious Mind comes
up with anything that would be maybe
bad about this product taking off in
Corporate America here's what they do
they measure and monitor pay gaps by any
demographic variable
pay Equity decisions made easy for HR
and compensation as well as consultants
as well as consultants
so you can sustain Fair pay and gain
ongoing data-driven support you could
book a demo today
that's right
you could take a company away from its
mission of making money and serving as
stockholders and you could make them
spend all of their time
trying to be fair across all demographic
variables
all of them all of the demographics
because if you if you find out that
short people are paid less you're going
to have to fix it
so it's so in theory
I'd like to know if they put in height
and weight and attractiveness
because you know those are correlated
right
you know that better looking people are
higher paid
is that fair
how about short people they're paid less
than to all people I think the pay
analytics needs to do more Analytics
I don't know if they've done enough
because if they only stopped with let's
say you know gender preference and
ethnicity and religion if they stopped
with that I say you've only gone half
the way
there are so many other demographics
that must be accounted for
so let's get that going
all right one of the biggest questions
I've been asked lately is am I serious
about my apologizing for being wrong
about everything in the pandemic
or as some people have suggested am I
just being sarcastic and just being a
jerk
right
all right what do you think
sarcastic or serious
go in the comments
what do you say
oh damn you damn you for getting the
right answers over there on locals the
locals people are all over me
they're always there
both how could I be serious and not
serious at the same time
is that possible
but how could how could I believe that I
was wrong about everything
if I really believe that I'm right about
everything they can't both be true right
it can't be true that I'm right about
everything and wrong about everything
would you agree
well let me let me change the question
how many would agree with the statement
it can't be simultaneously true agree
not it can't be true that I was wrong
about almost everything but also right
about everything
they can't both be true right we all
agree on that
all right that's where we differ
in my world they both can be true
forever
and there's no preferred truth
they're both true
completely true
unambiguously true and forever
and is not just a mental a mental thing
it might in my best understanding of My
reality
we are actually a simulation and it's
only because of the math of it you know
I won't go through the argument again
but it's like a trillion to one that
were simulated and not original
if we're simulated it seems clear that
in order to save processing power
our simulation allows us to live in our
own movie
I call it a movie because we're looking
at the same objective facts often not
always but often and yet we form our own
movie and then we live in it the only
thing the simulation requires that we
can still reproduce that's it if you
reproduce you make more of yourself so
there's more of you to do the same stuff
next year but if you don't reproduce you
know it's game over so the only thing
that matters is if we can reproduce and
as far as I know
the people who believe that vaccinations
were the worst experience we've ever had
and those who think it was no big deal
can still have babies
you know unless they've been sterilized
by accidental science
but as far as we know they can both have
we can still have babies with each other
so
what I'm doing my my own uh let's say
cognition of what I'm doing is that I'm
not
I'm not dishonest
when I when I say to the locals people
well obviously I got everything right
you watched every bit of it
and they say yeah that that meets my
view of the world some don't some would
say the opposite and then for those who
say the opposite I say well that's true
too
in a minute
um
a little bit I gotta do some other
stories at the end I'm going to tell you
something about
um viruses
that you didn't know
and it's important
do you think I can do that even at this
stage do you think there's something I
could tell you about viruses that you
didn't know that's really important
all right well let's let's see if I can
pull that off but you know I'll do that
at the end so those of you want to avoid
that conversation
all right so let's talk about Ukraine
did you hear the story that apparently
reportedly
Israel did some bogging runs or some
maybe some drones or missiles I don't
know but they attacked a bunch of
uh drone making factories in Iran
now
what do you make of that
Israel just did a massive attack on Iran
and took out some number of drone making
factories
I am so impressed
with Israel's decision-making
their their strategic
Excellence it's just crazy how good they
are
do you know how long they've wanted to
take out Iranian drone factories
I mean I'm just guessing but don't you
think they've wanted to take that with
the Iranian Jordan factories since the
moment they knew they existed right
because these drones are going to end up
with Hamas and the drones are going to
end up in Israel already have right
so
and do you think they could have done it
on day one
day what it would have looked like they
were starting you know a traditional War
it would have been pretty aggressive
but and what would have happened
um to Europe's reaction I think Europe
would have said Israel what the hell are
you doing
these Iranians are negotiating with us
in good faith to get some kind of a
nuclear deal and and then you're just
attacking them well that's no fair
stop that
am I right
two years ago correct me if I'm wrong
two years ago Europe would have said
Israel you know we're going to have to
give you some tough time about that
right do you think Europe is going to
give Israel a tough time about taking
out the source of Putin's drones
nope nope
this was a this was free money
this was so free money Israel just had a
total free punch and they took it
my God
are you impressed
you know when you watch the uh the
ukrainians and the NATO and the U.S you
have you have lots of
you know maybe this was good maybe bad
it's easy to criticize both sides
but what is there to criticize about
this
exactly Lexington lend never let a
crisis go to waste I actually I almost
tweeted that and deleted it I had a half
written and I decided not to say it but
yes
Israel said uh they're in the middle of
a big crisis we can just take out these
factories and everybody's just gonna say
okay
and I think that's what's happening
I think it was just a free punch and
they took it
Iran said no damage yeah I saw the uh I
saw the videos of the no damage it was a
pretty big Fireball for no damage
but on the other hand they could come
back and get them on YouTube somebody's
comparing me to Bill Crystal
yeah
yeah that's a that's a good comparison
Bill Crystal and me
we're like that
same opinions on everything
say simulation they could have their own
you can have your own uh reality about
that
all right
um
so
I don't know if you heard this story or
how old it is somebody can tell me how
old this story is how old is the story
about Conor McGregor being hit by a car
while he was riding his bicycle he's
okay he wasn't injured
how old is that story
was that just this week I only saw the
video this week but I had a feeling I'm
two weeks ago oh it was fairly new so
here's what happened to Conor McGregor
if you don't know uh one of the top or
at least the most famous MMA fighters
so the last guy you would ever want to
get in a fight with
would be Conor McGregor
am I right like you would never want to
make this guy angry
well here's what happened he was now
riding his bike presumably working out
and there was some kind of blind spot
because of the Sun the car came around
the corner and just took about it just
just took out the bike and destroyed it
now here's the best part of the story
how many of you could have survived
being hit by a car at full speed on a
bicycle
how many of you could survive that
so because
apparently saw the you know saw the
impending uh thing before he would you
could you know he had time to act and I
think he jumped off the bike
probably you know did some acrobatic
roles across the car
and landed properly
now not at his feet but he said he knew
how to land
that man could take a hit
oh my God was that the most interesting
story but it gets better
it gets better the guy who hit him of
course didn't know who he had
how would you like to be the guy who
just realized he just took out somebody
you don't know who it is and you're like
oh my God my God the first thing you
find out is that
you the first thing you find out is that
he's perfectly okay
so your first impression is oh
thank goodness
he's perfectly healthy
the second thing you find out is it's
Conor McGregor
do you think he was worried
so it gets better
because Connor takes out his phone so
you're seeing some of the aftermath
including his conversation with the guy
who hit him
just perfect just perfect
the guy who hit him looked so frightened
I've never seen anybody look more
frightened he was just like this and
then he offers him a ride offers Conor
McGregor right he says uh I could put
your bike in the back and give you a
ride and Connor's like yeah I need a
ride yeah that'd be great
so then Conor McGregor is doing a selfie
you know the video selfie in the card
he's describing what happens and then he
he turns the camera to show the guy
who's driving him he goes on the other
you know luckily he landed well and you
know he's given me a ride he shows the
guy the guy's like
because I have to think
he probably all the time thought he was
like five seconds from being killed
but what he doesn't understand
is if you're Conor McGregor
and somebody takes out your bicycle on
the highway
and you acrobatically survive
that was a good day
that wasn't a bad day
it was a good day
he got a great story out of it
yeah I think he scratched his ass or
something that was the worst of it
got a great story out of it did did
exactly what you would want to Hope two
people would do in that situation right
the guy who made who hit him didn't seem
like it was his fault because it was a
blind spot there and even Conor said
that so the two of them completely
reached a non-angry
resolution in which they were helping
each other it was just the coolest story
just the coolest story
yeah
anyway I liked it
um
I saw Jesse Waters talking about uh
Hunter and I don't know is there
something new on this story or was he
just recapping it because this is in the
news today I'm not sure why it was new
but the FBI has recordings of Hunter
talking to the what what hunter called
the effing spy chief of China
and there was this one guy who like they
thought was a spy called Patrick ho
and this Patrick ho was
part of the money making scheme in which
Hunter and presumably Joe Biden made
money from China
going through this Patrick o and I read
the whole story and the only commentary
I have on it is
you know Joe Biden said that Hunter
Biden was the smartest person he knew
and you doubted that right you doubted
it
but uh he's the only person I've ever
heard of who ever made money from a hoe
that's all I have to say
he might be the smartest person I know
too I don't know anybody who ever made
money on a hoe unless they were a pimp
but he wasn't append
so
smartest person I know
um but it makes you wonder if we have
these recordings
and we know every part of the story
how is it Joe Biden still the president
it's it's so weird
that he's still the president and I
wonder I wonder if we're or most of us
are living in the same kind of cognitive
dissonance
that the the TDS people were you know
the Trump derangement syndrome because
the thing that surprises the Trump
haters the most
is that Trump is not in jail
right
now the reason Trump is not in jail is
the total lack of committing crimes that
are jailable
maybe has something to do with not
committing any jailable offenses right
but they can't see that to them he you
know was a traitor ran an Insurrection
did all kinds of things are we doing the
same thing with Biden
or is that how they get away with it
they make they make you think well maybe
you're not right because we're acting
like it's not right we're treating it
like it doesn't exist so maybe you're
not right maybe you've got a little
derangement syndrome there Scott
I don't even know
if if I if I'm being dead honest
I don't know
because that's the nature of
confirmation bias right the nature of
cognitive dissonance is the person who
has it
doesn't know
so what if I have it
what if the bidens didn't do anything
shady
and it just looks exactly like that in
every way
to me and people who saw the same stuff
I saw is that possible
because you trust me there's nobody who
has Trump derangement syndrome who
thinks they have trumped Arrangement
syndrome
they all think they're just looking at
the facts and reaching a decision well
that's what I think I'm doing
well why am I right and they're wrong
remember my rule about knowing who's got
cognitive dissonance
you'd look for someone who has the
trigger
and you know they exhibit the Tells I'm
not sure I see any
but then maybe I wouldn't
yeah the word salad have I exhibited any
word salad about Biden
well you wouldn't know because if you're
on the if you're on the same page it
would look like it made sense to you
yeah
anyway
we'll keep an eye on that because it
looks like nobody cares so Trump went
after DeSantis a little bit for closing
Florida when apparently other Governors
did not that was a pretty good that's a
pretty good uh offense
so obviously Trump is trying to degrade
desantis's presidential uh possibilities
but that's an interesting attack isn't
it because Trump never supported uh
lockdowns apparently
so he can look the governors that didn't
lock down and they can compare him to
DeSantis and suddenly DeSantis doesn't
look so good because because he's
reframed him he's reframed it from
comparing DeSantis to DeSantis to
comparing him to Governors who who
didn't close down
that's a pretty good political approach
right just from a persuasion perspective
pretty good it's pretty good because he
understands his base doesn't like the
lockdowns
he never supported them
or mandates and DeSantis did for a
little while not for long so we still
give to Santa's credit for you know
being one of the more right people
but then Trump also
um apparently there's a story that Nikki
Haley called Trump
and said she's considering running and
in the primaries against him
what do you think Trump said when Nikki
Haley said she's considering running
against him
what would be his smartest response
go for it because the more people in the
primaries the more likely he wins
because he's going to keep his 25
percent
so if the other people can split what's
left over yeah he's he's the nominee
again worked the first time why wouldn't
it work again
yeah so that was exactly the right
answer
so he's definitely right on his attack
for DeSantis in terms of persuasion Wise
It's a good approach and he is
definitely right strategically telling
Nikki Haley yeah go for it
good strategy
but then I saw a video in which he was
talking about uh the energy policy the
Biden energy policy and it sounded like
he was saying that there's like these
stupid energy things and good energy
things and the good energy things were
the fossil fuel types and the bad energy
things that were silly I don't think he
named him by name but it sounded like he
was going after solar and wind power
right that that was the implication
now what do you think of his messaging
his messaging is fossil fuel is good
uh alternative things can never be good
you know they're not good and will never
be good
is that is that good messaging or bad
it's an F yeah that's a fail
uh on if I'm going to grade this it's
not even a d Plus
this is just a total failure
here's here's what a good message for a
republican candidate would look like
you know there's something we can all
come together on on energy
it used to be there was a lot of
disagreement on nuclear energy
but with the generation three which has
never had any
um deaths or problems
uh or big problems and with the fact
that we now can store the spend fuel on
site
so we don't have to transport it that's
you know sort of where the industry went
and now that the newer generations of
nuclear could eat some of that waste as
their fuel could use some of the waste
as their fuel
we should definitely come together a
nuclear and do it as quickly as possible
now I think we should also go heavy on
fossil fuel
unless until we have Alternatives but I
don't see them coming happening quickly
however I also agree that the free
market should continue every other
technological innovation because there
might be something some change you know
you might have better batteries or
better solar panels or better windmills
so that'd be great
at the moment we think we need as much
fossil fuel as possible to give America
its independence economic uh economic
growth as well as being secure from our
enemies in the long run we like
technical technological innovation but
we don't want to over subsidize it
that's a problem we don't want to over
subsidize things let the free market do
what it does as much as possible
now
is there any reason that he has to not
mention nuclear the one thing we all
agree on or or we're coming close to it
that's the one I'd play on
and why can't he say that the other
stuff is fine as long as we don't over
subsidize it
it's like he's trying not to win with
that message
I mean it looks like
virtue signaling I just think it's he
doesn't need that much Nuance to make it
perfect
because here are the things that we
should all be agreeing on we should be
agreeing on immigration have a strong
border security but have some bipartisan
group
of economic economists decide who would
let in and when so you've got some
Independence about that decision but you
know be secure On the Border
everybody would agree with that
so he has all these topics from
education
um uh including uh
Public School Alternatives Etc all kinds
of stuff that he could pick off
Democrats
let me just give you a
sort of a mental
um I guess exercise
let's say you wanted to pick off some
Democrats but you didn't want to lose
your base
he could definitely pick some off on
immigration
just by being reasonable he could
definitely pick him off by being
pro-nuclear and pro-green enough that
he's not against it but also wants to
make our economy and work well I think
he can make energy work I think he can
make Ukraine something we come together
on
I think you could pull some Democrats
off of that pile
he has all these issues
even the even the CRT and transgender
stuff in schools I think he could pick
off Democrats on that at this point in
not before but at this point sure
so he has this total ability to take 10
of the Democrats
totally
and and there's a and and he can mock
the January 6th thing out of the news
if he chooses to if every time he's
asked about he goes all right let's be
serious
are you really trying to tell the story
that Republican stage an Insurrection
without guns
and then don't even answer any other
question I go but you answer me the
question I know you have lots of
questions for me but honestly I'm I'm
actually curious
do you actually think that's what a res
an Insurrection would look like do you
think I'm so bad at insurrections that I
would think that trespassing for a day
without weapons would conquer the United
States
how does that even make sense
right so
every every attack on Trump
at the moment
is completely empty
all he has to do is reframe them but so
far he's not
so far he's not he's not taking any of
the free money
that that is available now that really
wasn't available in 2016 or 2020.
because things have changed right at
this point getting getting both sides to
agree on ending the Ukraine stuff you
don't think he can pick off people on
both sides on that issue we didn't have
that issue before he could definitely
get some yeah
so the oh here Trump has a super highway
to win
he just has to stay in the middle of the
highway and not say bad framing for
topics that he doesn't need to frame
badly there's just no reason
but we'll see what he does so I'm
totally unimpressed by his energy take
to me that's just a failure
like I can't give it even like nice try
I can't even say it's good for the base
really it's not even good for the base
it's like just bad
all right
here now is something you did not know
about viruses
uh you've heard of measles
and I'm old enough to have had measles
before there were vaccinations
and here's something I learned today
in 2019 so this is an article in WebMD
from 2019. one of the things we learned
about measles
that we didn't know for a hundred years
how long have we known that measles
existed hundreds of years
something like that
here's something you didn't know
a number of studies are showing that the
measles may have wiped out your uh your
body's memory
for immunity of other things
the measles may have wiped out your
immunity for other things
and that's something that they're
learning just lately
after 50 years of science
so in other words there is long long
measles
long measles
apparently exists because it can take
out your immunity to other things and
then those other things get you now
that's something we didn't know for 50
years
so what do we know about the Coronavirus
do you think the coronavirus could take
you out like 50 years from now we could
find out oh it did some bad things that
we didn't know
what about the vaccination itself
what about that do you think in 50 years
we can find out it did something to us
50 years ago
it all seems possible doesn't it now
does it change your mind that we only
found out how dangerous measles is
in 2019
2019. and by the way the article the
people talking about it were fouchy
fauci was in the article
and Michael Mina
who you knew from the pandemic talking
about the absence of fast testing rapid
testing so two of the characters were
well known from the pandemic were part
of this story as well they were the main
people in the story
so
interesting
um
what is your belief about the mainstream
opinion of long covet not your own
opinion not your own opinion what do you
believe if you were to Google what would
be the front page of Google results not
saying it's true I'm just asking you
what would appear
would it say that long covet is pretty
much a thing definitely what is saying
maybe we're still looking into it or
would it say you know I've got a feeling
this isn't real
all right the Google search
um and again I'm not I'm not endorsing
this is being correct
if you just Googled you would see that
long covet is very real that's their
claim not mine
very real
and it's kind of a big deal now usually
it's something that would last months
now what percentage of people according
to the Google front page
not me what percentage of people do you
think experienced long covet which they
would Define as let's say weeks or
months of brain fog and fatigue
like 45 percent
45 percent
now
if you had if you lost three months of
your life to fatigue
how big of a risk would you take to
avoid that
of course the vaccination risk you know
is everything including death because
it's an unknown you don't know what
happens to you or anybody else
there's no way to there's no way to
measure the two risks
but what if kovid which was well let me
ask this question so here's here's
something I had genuine curiosity for
[Applause]
um
how did you know that Co that long covid
wouldn't be
as bad as maybe long measles is
how did you know that
so I asked people how they knew it and
a lot of people said they knew it
because the the data said that people
were getting it and recovering and they
knew people who it was just a cold and
they got over it
now that's people telling me that they
know the future because they know the
present
to me that's not even a thing
because in the present I thought measles
was just something that happened to me
then
but 50 years later I found out oh it
turns out I thought I was safe but maybe
I wasn't but people uh unlike the
measles case there were a lot of people
who looked at the covet current
information and from that they formed
certainty about the future
now I don't know how to do that
I only could look at current information
and say well I don't know about the
future
um so I asked Ivor Ivor Cummins who is a
famous
opponent to vaccinations and he said
oh I also asked
if how do you explain that the
scientists and Drug executives
presumably but we don't know
took the shots themselves
like if you think they're dangerous how
would you explain that to people who
invented them
took them
and what I found was that the majority
of people that I pulled believe they
didn't
they believed they didn't take them
which is totally possible
that is totally possible
you know there was a day when I would
have said come on
right there was a time in my life I
always said come on
if the executives and the scientists who
invented them didn't take them
we would know that there would be
whistleblowers and you know it would
just be so obvious you would know it
yes Katie Katie is also uh confusing the
uh the future in the past so there's
somebody on here who can't tell the
difference between
today and the future you're right do you
know there's a difference
you should uh you should look into that
so there are things that happen like
today that can be different than things
that happen in the future
and sometimes the Futures are unknown
sometimes you don't know I know that's
the first time you're finding that out
Katie I know so Katie is screaming in
all caps Scott in 2020 we must
immediately close the entire country
down from all international flights at
lockdown
first of all Katie
that was about China only
China only
and that was when we didn't know what it
was
and I said well at least shut down until
we find out
so with the information we have the time
that's called the present
now I know these concepts are unfamiliar
but the present is different than the
past
and also different in the future
now if I had known what you know Katie
apparently you're a time traveler and
you knew from the first moment that it
was no risk
you are my role model
I want to be like you and go on podcasts
and Shout in all capital letters that
the future and the current are the same
that I can look at my future data today
and then with the benefit of the future
data I could make decisions today
now that's something I didn't know Katie
so thank you for correcting me Oh Katie
you got very quiet
how embarrassing to be you right now
all right
so but there is
uh and as people said to me and I expect
that they would say this
that there is actually an entirely
reasonable uh argument a totally
reasonable argument why all of the
scientists and all of the executives or
some portion of them might have skipped
the shots
and lied to you
that is possible in 2022 and 2021 I
would say we've actually reached the
point of ridiculousness where that was
actually possible now if I had to put
odds on it I would say not very high
but it's actually possible now here's
another possibility
the scientists and executives
were so let's say enamored by how much
money they were going to make because
even the scientists were going to get
rich just on stock options anybody who
owned company stocks got rich
so everybody was going to make a killing
and the only thing they had to do
was tell you that it was safe
that's all they had to do and they would
all get rich
and then they had they had immunity
right they had negotiated immunity so
once they negotiated immunity they'd
lost all incentives to tell you the
truth
they had no incentive to tell you the
truth because they had immunity and if
they lied this is hypothetical but if
they lied they would get rich
and they would have no risk
so do you think that people who have a
choice of getting rich if they say one
thing are they objective anymore of
course not of course not so it's
entirely possible and it fits within my
understanding of psychology that
everyone at the big Pharma was in
cognitive distance and convinced
themselves they were working for the
good
but we're doing the opposite I'm not
saying that's the case I'm saying that
would be fully within the normal scope
of human behavior
totally accepted now
if you told me that that situation would
remain that way forever
well then I get skeptical
the longer you wait the more somebody's
gonna you know leave the ranks you're
going to get a whistleblower
so here's a question I ask
um
where's the whistleblowers
the ones who say we knew it was bad for
you but we did it anyway
where are they
how much would you have to make to be a
whistleblower in this situation
because I think if you're a scientist or
you work there you probably made five
million dollars
don't you think
don't you think that like a top
scientist probably made Five Ten twenty
million dollars just on stock options
just for going to work
I think you know because they probably
had a top scientist probably had a
million or two in stock options which
you know ballooned immediately up to 10
million or something
so
but suppose you offered 20 million
dollars
for any whistleblower who could tell you
that they they knew it was dangerous and
did it anyway without telling you the
danger
do you think anybody would answer for 20
million dollars
remember follow the money
well if you say no then you're releasing
a little bit on the follow of the money
because the top Executives would lose
money if they became whistleblowers
right the top executive has probably
made a billion a piece
or 100 million or something so they
would lose money 20 million would be a
bad deal for them
um but if you're let's say just an
employee a staff person let's say you
made a million dollars in stock options
pretty darn good for a year of work
but you take 20.
I think you'd take 20 million
I don't know if it's taxable our
whistleblower whistleblower compensation
is that taxable
is there any special carve out for
whistleblowers for taxes because I don't
know if you get the 20 or you get the
10.
so maybe you only get half of it right
that's why I made it 20 million
so
if you believe that they were bad people
doing bad things the questions you'd
have to ask is why did they all take it
or how did they all hide the fact they
didn't
or how could there not be at least one
whistleblower
just one whistleblower who likes 20
million dollars and likes attention just
one
then maybe there will be one maybe we
just wait a little while and they'll
feel safer to come out right it's
possible
so here's where I went wrong
all right
I believe I was biased by uh
people who take drugs the illegal kind
if you have any experience in the
illegal drug world
what's the number one rule of whether or
not you put a drug in your mouth number
one rule what is it
it's an illegal drug
what's the number one rule before you
put it in your mouth or you smoke it
did you watch somebody else do it
that's the number one rule did you watch
somebody reach into the same bag and
take out the same you know pill or
powder or whatever it's going to be
and watch them put it in their mouth
and then the next day they're still
alive
right
if you took like if you took mushrooms
from a bag that you don't know anybody's
ever tried
well you're really taking the chance
there
right so the number one rule in fact it
was the rule I mentioned to my stepson
before he violated the rule and died
because I'm pretty sure that he took
some things and simply handed him right
and there was at least one other person
who died from the same batch the same
day so the batch was that the batch was
bad
nobody nobody tested from that batch
right so it's the number one thing so
when I look at the the vaccinations
slash shots
the number one question I said is well
are they take him
right is he are the executives taking
him
what about the scientists who invented
it are they taking what about Dr Malone
Dr Malone the you know co-inventor of
the MRNA did he take it he did he did
he says he did we can't prove anything
right but I imagine you wouldn't lie
about that
um now here's my second question
if you took the executives and the top
scientists of the big Pharma and you
brought him before Congress would it be
legal
to ask them the question did you get the
vaccination
it might be illegal to ask because it's
their personal medical stuff right they
could just say I don't talk about my
personal medical situation
so even Congress can't find out if they
took the shot right
am I right
or does
let me think now the government has a
record of our vaccination status though
right
don't they
do a fact check I mean the whole point
of having the vaccination cards is that
everybody who got a vaccination
was entered so if the executives and the
scientists who invented it
if they have a card and they're on a
record you still don't know if they got
a saline because half of you believe
they got sailing right
but don't you think do you think that
that there would be no whistleblower if
the executives and the scientists were
taking Saline
you don't think you get a whistleblower
for that
see I could imagine no whistleblower on
the basic question of whether they knew
it was dangerous
I could imagine no whistleblower on that
even if there was something there
but I can't imagine I can't imagine my
head my head cannot hold and hold into
it that you wouldn't have a
whistleblower by now if if a number of
them like a large number got a saline
shot
do you believe they could keep that
secret up till now
I don't know
it certainly
I I think it's possible
yeah I I think the uh the things we've
seen from the Russia collusion to
you know the the laptop to I mean think
about the fact there are 51 people who
signed that Hunter laptop thing
51 people
not a single one of them has come
forward and said you know that wasn't
real we were just trying to influence
things
no whistleblowers there
that's 51 people no whistleblowers
Tuskegee there were no whistleblowers
for a long time right
so there are lots of situations where
there are no whistleblowers
yeah it could happen
but here's where I'm telling you my bias
my bias is
that I presumed
it's most likely that they took it
and then I said well if the people who
know the most about it took it
that's an argument but then I I have to
admit it never occurred to me
that they could have taken saline shots
and gotten away with it
but we do live in a world where they
could have I don't think it happened
like it my my assessment of the odds the
odds that the executives and scientists
took saline I'd put it
10 percent
I put that at 10 percent
and 10 is high yeah I'm I'm stretching
to get to 10 because that would be one
hell of a I mean that would be the crime
of the whole
wouldn't that be the crime of the
century
or the biggest crime since you know
Genghis Khan or biggest crimes in Stalin
or Mao or something
but maybe
yeah yeah like
uh as somebody who's saying over here
I'm gullible now remember
um I I believe we're a simulation
and I believe that your movie in which I
got everything wrong and I trusted
um I trusted big entities
is completely true
but at the same time the other movie is
completely true that I didn't trust any
entities and I didn't trust the virus
so they're just both true at the same
time and there's nothing wrong with it
they can just both be true
they took it at a time we thought covert
was a bio weapon
but did they get boosters because we
would also have a record of their
boosters
I think what you'd find is that the
um the people attached to it got boosted
if they were old and had comorbidities
and maybe not if they're young
that's what I think you would find
all right
um
so the number of people who believe only
19 percent of the people I surveyed
believe that the executives at the
scientists actually took it themselves
61 percent believed that it was a saline
shot or they didn't take it
61 percent of you
believe the executives and the
scientists who made it didn't take it
isn't there some way to find out
like I get that if it was a super clever
saline solution thing maybe you couldn't
but I feel like there's some way to find
out
I just don't know what it is yeah Google
it
Google it won't work
yeah all right
all right
um but anyway all it would take to make
me happy would be a GoFundMe of 20
million dollars
for a whistleblower who could say
something we don't already know
you'd have to specify what they
specifically what their claim would have
to be to pay them but if they could
prove it
with documents especially
that would be amazing
DJ bear wants you to know
this is fake and he's going to say it
20 times so far
just keep saying it
yeah he just wants to type it over and
over again
we're um DJ bear we're gonna
make you invisible here
you are now hidden but I encourage you
to keep typing
um
all right
could sign something that we would know
yeah
all right
I also wonder how many doctors have died
from the shot
no you
'd love to know how many medical doctors
because there must be enough of them how
many medical doctors are in the United
States it's well over a hundred thousand
right
million I don't know 100 000.
does anybody have any idea
but don't you figure that the medical
professionals are probably 98 vaccinated
wouldn't you say
uh maybe 90 percent
but do you think uh there are any
vaccinated people
I know now
here's something I said that nobody
called me on and you should have
I said something really sketchy earlier
you should have called me on it when I
said that Google says that at the moment
45 percent of people are saying they
have long covered symptoms
you were supposed to say
aren't they all vaccinated
and then I'd say oh yeah that's true you
can't tell if it's long covered or long
long Jab
now I think because of the timing of and
such people can tell it's from the covet
not the shock
but I was expecting you to say that
I was expecting
all right
yeah very suspect all right that's all
for now YouTube I'll talk to you
tomorrow thanks for joining have a good
