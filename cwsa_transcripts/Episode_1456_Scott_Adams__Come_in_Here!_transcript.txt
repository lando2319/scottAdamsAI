been working with the local
subscribers here trying to work it out
and somehow magically
it's all working out so if you can hear
me
then something worked fine
thanks for showing up now
you missed the first part of the
presentation where i
send this over to my email does it seem
like i'm not prepared today
had massive technical problems
oh me all right
bear with me one moment oh me
i swear to god
uh have you learned that um
just trying to use a an application
is is like cr you have to be a hacker to
get into your own account
now i've got like multiple sign-ons and
they've got to text me
and they've got to change my password
and fix my settings and update my
software
every time i want to use an
application
my god this stuff is so broken
like just just to use any application
i've got to like
search my records for the last sign in
i've got to get a new password
something's out of date
i can't just turn on an
application and just
 use it jesus
all right sorry didn't mean to take the
lord's name in vain
so here's what we're gonna do since i'm
locked out of some other account
that i use every day
for no reason that just happened
overnight
i'm going to be looking sideways to get
my notes
do i seem like i'm in a cranky mood this
morning
does it feel like maybe i could explode
any minute
oh charlotte says to please explain my
jesus
sign to those who don't understand so
over my shoulder if you're listening on
audio there's a little sign
that says jesus king is the audio is
fine
now it only says that because i've got
yellow sticky notes over parts of the
words
on the original sign and let's just say
the king part
was the last part of a word that started
with f
so i got rid of the fuc part
and i didn't like taking the name
the lord's name in vain here on on the
live stream so
the is the is is used to say christ
but i got rid of the ch and the t
so i just turned it from a uh a very
vulgar sign into a very polite one jesus
king is
uh sorry i didn't think i was going to
get youtube working today all right
let's actually talk about some content
i'm very happy that the olympics is on
and i a couple of highlights today
so i'm not going to talk much about the
olympics but there are some really good
highlights
some good news number one the american
women's soccer team lost i don't know
about you but i was
i was sort of rooting for them to lose
do i not understand how the olympics
works
i'm not supposed to be rooting for my
own country to lose right
but i kind of did i kind of rooted for
them to lose because the
the kneeling you know the whole point of
representing your country
if you're not going to do that if you're
not going to represent your country
and you're going to you know kneel for
the national anthem or something
i'm all for that you're you're welcome
to have your protest and i have no
problem with that whatsoever however
however i also have the right to root
against you
so i was kind of happy that the women's
soccer team lost
because uh they don't represent me in a
way that i would want to be represented
now number two the other best story is
that uh new zealand weightlifter laurel
hubbard
she made history because she'll be the
first openly
transgender female author to compete at
the olympics
in weightlifting so laurel
hubbard transgender athlete
is is in the olympics and i find this a
highlight of the olympics
personally now i know some of you may be
purists and saying to yourself hey this
is ruining the sport
it's unfair to to uh i don't know
biologically naturally born women is
that offensive or
i've lost track so if that's offensive
wasn't meant to be but i love this story
because first of all what's the point of
the olympics
well nothing really i mean the olympics
had a
a purpose in olden days but they don't
really have any purpose now it's to
sell advertisement or tv spots or
something i don't know it doesn't really
have any purpose
in my in my view the olympics don't but
they are entertainment now be honest
what do you find more entertaining
the skiing and shooting competition
the jumping up and down and weird ways
competition
the leaping over uh
things competition the running fast
competition
which one of those is entertaining
maybe not any of them but can you tell
me you're not
entertained by a transgender athlete
coming into the weightlifting and
winning everything
come on you could have lots of feelings
about that
and that's a separate topic but it's
definitely entertaining
so let's so let's have that
so there's new information on the wuhan
uh virus leak
hypothesis
who lost oh she lost already
the transgender athlete already lost
well that ruins everything
i think i might want to see some blood
tests of whoever beat the transgender
athlete
might want to see a little blood test
there just saying um
so anyway the wuhan lake has some more
uh information
that um makes it look more like it was a
leak
so first of all they had a leadership
change at the lab in 2019
oh yeah there's something missing isn't
there
oh my god do you realize i i leapt into
this without the simultaneous sip
yeah it's pretty pretty bad at me
but never too late never too late
and if you'd like to enjoy this to the
maximum ability that you can muster all
you need is a copper mug of glass up
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better
including the youtube app it's called
the simultaneous sip and watch it happen
now go
well for those of you on youtube over on
the locals platform i'm watching a
commenter who has put a
picture of a cat eating a banana
and if you think that's not entertaining
well you're so wrong
cat eating a banana entertaining every
time
all right the wuhan lab so here's some
things we found down about the wuhan lab
apparently one is that there was a
management change in 2019
which suggests maybe there were some
problems they had to change management
number two there was a uh proposal out
to
fix the ventilation uh two years after
the ventilation had been put in new
what so there might have been some
problem with the ventilation that they
were aware of at just about the wrong
time if you know what i mean
apparently there was a increase in
google searches on kovid 19.
how did it even have a name kovan 19 had
a name before added name
and people were google searching it
before you ever heard of it i don't
understand
that part of the story so and there was
a bunch of activity around the lab at
about that time and
no intermediate species have been found
that would suggest that it
came from a natural species and then
also
a couple more experts have told you
that it could easily have been
bio-engineered
and you wouldn't see a trace of it do
you remember that
for like a year the common knowledge was
that you could not bioengineer this
virus without leaving
signs that it was done by humans do you
remember that
that was common knowledge now i've told
you before that sometimes i hear things
before you do and i can't give you
examples because then i'd have to
tell you how i found down about them and
stuff so
trust me that sometimes i hear the news
a year before you do
like literally a year before you hear it
something like um a few weeks into the
pandemic
at the very beginning of the pandemic i
had a long phone call with one of the
you know one of the smartest people who
knows about this kind of stuff
and that smartest person showed me
a a satellite picture of the wuhan lab
and said it came out of there in all
likelihood
nothing proven but it was too
coincidental it was sort of across the
street from the well
the the wet market so long before the
news was reporting anything
i was looking at a picture of the wuhan
lab on a google map
and and being told by somebody who was
really smart
this is where it came from at the same
time
i asked the question could you make this
virus look like
it was natural if it had been
bio-engineered and the person
that i talked to said oh yeah definitely
you could definitely make it look
natural
so that's what i knew like months and
months
before it was in the news you know so
so and you know i'm not unique in that
way so there were plenty of people who
knew what was going on
but here's the weird part why did it
take a year
i think it felt like a year maybe it was
just months
for experts to say that it could have
been engineered and you wouldn't know
the difference
why did that take so long i mean i knew
it i knew it
probably a year before it was public
knowledge
and scott once again being a narcissist
so one of the weird things about
narcissism
is that uh narcissists think other
people are narcissists
i don't know if you knew that but that's
one of the one of the traits is that if
you are a narcissist
you project and so you see other people
as narcissists and whatever problems you
have you just see them in other people
and i've come to believe that a lot of
my critics
are just narcissists and the problem is
that they're pretty sure they're right
can never be wrong and if i say
something that disagrees with anything
that they believe
there's got to be a problem with me and
the way you can tell that it's
narcissists
as opposed to just critics let me let me
give you
let me give you a contrast so today
if you saw any of my twitter tweets you
saw people saying things about me
such as scott scott must be
either bought off compromised bought
into the narrative or afraid
and those are the only explanations for
why my opinion
might be different from let's say my
critics have been the only reasons
there could be no other reasons but that
i've been bribed
uh or i've got you know some kind of
problem going on
or i can't admit i'm wrong or something
something like that
now here's let me contrast
uh a conversation i had with an
economist
who is not a narcissist and it went like
this
uh scott in your analysis of the risks
of
you know the vaccines blah blah you
forgot one
very important variable and i asked for
a clarification
and the economist gave me the variable
and then i said
a good point i should bring that up
the point was that in the short term
your risk of the vaccine
vaccination is you know
there's one risk for the vaccination but
since you didn't have to get the
vaccination
because your odds of actually getting
the virus in the short term
or almost nothing so that short term
long term way that i was framing things
was missing a big variable now when an
economist
who is not a narcissist gives me
a criticism i say well what
what facts are you looking at what
argument are you looking at
it's presented to me and then i say oh
good point
and then just like i did now i tell you
that my argument was flawed
and that i corrected it that's how
that's how two
people who are not having any kind of
mental difficulty
have a conversation oh you forgot this
variable what is this variable
oh good point i'd now change my opinion
to incorporate that variable
now what does it look like when a
narcissist comes after me
does it look like oh scott you forgot a
variable have you considered this
in your argument never never
it's always it's always some assumption
about me
personally being broken in one of a
variety of ways
is that what's going on now i'm clearly
as broken as anybody else
in my own ways right we're all
everybody's up
if you think there's somebody
if you think that there's some hold on
jojo
it's not name calling if you're talking
about me
when i say somebody's a narcissist
that's a description of behaviors
that's not name calling so and it's a
hypothesis which i'm giving you
support for so pretty different than i'm
calling but maybe you were talking about
some of the commenters there
um so when you see the people coming
after me with nothing but
attacks on my character or saying i've
been bought off or something like that
they are probably not actual critics
in the classic sense where they have
something to complain about
they seem to be just narcissists and
they're projecting
upon me that's what it looks like and
and you you can tell because you can
look for
cases where i've changed my mind because
there was data i just gave you one
and and did i have any problem
just observe me did i have any problem
telling you that i
i was wrong and have now corrected it
i have no problem with that because
remember the nature of this
live stream is about um sort of mental
i'd say the biggest theme that goes
through all of it is mental
illusions which we're all trying to you
know get past
so if i have a mental illusion and a
total like brain
fart i'd like to show it to you
you know my my motivation is to show you
i was wrong
not to show you i'm right all the time
but
if i am right it is very useful
as a tool that you hear me explain them
right so that you can judge
oh this kind of track record and then
the next thing i say
you'll say well let's let's put that in
the context of how many times he's been
right or wrong
that is useful to you so if it sounds
like narcissism to tell you how often
i've been right
just put it put it in a different
category it's just useful
you need to know what i think is my
track record and you could disagree with
it sure
but you need to know what i think or
else you can't put my opinions in
context
all right speaking of china they've got
problems with the wuhan leak they've got
massive flooding they've got
pollution through the roof they've got
they've got prison camps they've they
may be
harvesting organs from political
dissidents
they're stealing our intellectual
property they're
you know dominating the south china sea
they're doing just about everything bad
you could do
i mean the list is so long that it's
hard to go through them all
china is no longer safe
for business and as that
that understanding starts to permeate
the rest of the world
china's got some big big problems coming
some of them are just baked into the
fact that it's a big country and
lots of big things could happen from you
know floods and climate and everything
else
but i've got a feeling that china might
have
like a really big problem coming
and you'll know it when you see it it's
going to come in a variety of ways
from a variety of sources and
it's going to look like a lot of
coincidences
but here's the question i ask you since
we do seem to know
that china has this concept of i don't
know what do they call it total warfare
or something
where they're really trying to degrade
their opponents in every way they can
they're trying to do it with psychology
with the law with
technology with hacking just every way
you can
short of shooting an actual missile
and what do you assume
about their adversaries do you assume
unrestricted warfare that's the phrase
they use yes um
what do you assume about the adversaries
we all know it right all of the
adversaries to china know
that that's their stated philosophy
the unrestricted warfare and we see them
using it
so there's no doubt that they believe it
there's no doubt they're doing it every
day
what do you think we're doing what do
you think
great britain is doing about it what do
you think europe's doing about it
what do you think japan is doing about
it about south korea
how about the united states
now one one theory is that we're doing
nothing
because maybe we just don't do that
that's possible
but what do you think what's more likely
because here's the one complaint i don't
have about biden
he's not a
would anybody disagree with that i'm
open to a counter
argument on that but as much as i like
you know trump for a lot of stuff
i think different presidents are good
for different stuff so it's good that we
alternate them so you get the good stuff
of each
personality but i don't think biden's a
i've got a feeling that biden is kicking
the out of china under the hood
and we just don't know it and he
wouldn't tell us because that's the kind
of president he is
don't know that there's no way to know
that for sure
um and i wish we could see some signs of
it but i don't think it works that way
so my guess is that the
the counter attacks to balance out
whatever whatever the hell chinese is
doing
um are probably just ramping up
so i would imagine that we're just
getting busy with that stuff now one of
the biggest risks as you might know is
that china with this belton road
initiative and it's basically trying to
get
influence over all the smaller countries
especially if they have
rare earth minerals so one of the
biggest ways that
china could conquer the world and
dominate it is by controlling all the
rarest of the minerals that are needed
for all pretty much all technology
that's also if you didn't know it and i
think this is true
i'll take a fact check on this too but i
think it's true that the reason that
space exploration is such a big freaking
deal
is that if the united states can't get
on an asteroid
to get some you know rare mineral
minerals off the asteroids
i don't know if we'll have access so
space might be the only place we can get
the materials we need to be an advanced
civilization
now the other thing that uh you have to
factor in with china
and china also makes too many of our
medicines the other thing you have to
factor in is that
the chinese billionaires
probably have as much influence over
there as a billionaire does
anywhere else which is a lot
again i would take a fact check on that
i'm imagining the richest people in
china are like the richest people
anywhere else they have lots of
influence
so if the richest people in china are
let's say
many of them our own minds and rare
earth everything
this and that um
every morning there's a bird that walks
across my security camera
during the live stream just one one time
this little black bird
he just walks across the security camera
once
um anyway so so here's the point
china is trying to control these rare
rare earth materials
and pharmaceuticals but if we ever got
into a deep
problem with china uh if it became
military
uh that's the least of our problems
right if we if we ended up in a in a
full-out
military conflict with china we're not
going to be worrying about
pharmaceutical
access because the whole damn planet
will be destroyed
but if it's not a full military conflict
do you think the billionaires that
control the pharmaceuticals
in china or control the mining interests
are going to let the government
shut them down now of course the
government is more powerful than a
billionaire even in china
but still there's some big big
influences in china
that would be pushing back and imagine
if you will
um you know there's sort of a
mutually assured destruction when it
comes to china and pharmaceuticals or
rare earth minerals what would happen
the day
that china said we're not going to give
you america
any rare earth minerals or any
pharmaceuticals we're just cutting you
off
what would happen the same day it would
be the end of china
their economy would go into a free fall
and never recover
right now somebody says war it wouldn't
be war it would be economic war
and it would be permanent it would be
permanent there would be no recovery
if china ever said we have we have a
monopoly on your anything
your pharmaceuticals or your rare earth
minerals and we're going to stop you
from having them
that would be the end of the chinese
economy because the chinese economy
depends on the rest of the world it
doesn't operate
independently and the rest of the world
would just say
okay that's too far that's too far
you can't be trusted with anything not
our rare earth minerals not our
pharmaceuticals
frickin nothing so that would be the end
of china
so i'm less worried about them cutting
off things
than maybe other people are because it
would be literally suicide
you know china would be destroying
itself
um china is surrounded by enemies i'm
saying in the
in the comments so that it would be
suicide for china to start a war
well yeah i mean any superpower that
gets in a war with another superpower
why i mean you the only reason you do
that is if you just
given up on living and
i suppose anything's possible
all right uh so china i see coming for a
big reckoning
and i don't think china necessarily
knows how big it will be
and as i've told you before there are
always
forces you can see and forces you can't
see
and forces you can't see are leaning
pretty hard on china right now
and you're going to see the effect of
that probably within a year
so alexander vinman you all know him
from the famous
trump impeachment trials he was the
officer who's now retired
he's got a book but he said something in
an interview
that i want to share with you because it
looks like it's written by a
professional persuader
so here's his actual statement he said
about the trump administration he said
quote
we could have had a collapse of
government and could have been
an entirely different country so
according to vinman we were very close
to a collapse of government and
could have had we could have been in an
entirely different country
does that sound like something that
vinman came up with
on his own maybe
you know he might have some training and
some kind of persuasion or something
like that
but let me tell you why this is a good
persuasion
this sentence we could have been in an
entirely different country
what's that mean we could have been in
an entirely different country
this is childini level
persuasion i don't know if the publisher
helped him with it
i don't know if a democrat persuader
helped with it
oh
okay uh
i'll get to that in a moment just some
breaking news just came across my phone
here
um so vinman is
cleverly leaving it to your imagination
of what's the worst thing you can
imagine
that this country could have turned into
which is this other thing
that's good persuasion if you tell
something somebody something specific
they're likely to say oh i don't know
that specific thing
i don't think that was going to happen
so if vinman had said
for example if he had said uh it would
be a dictatorship in a year
even people who didn't like trump would
have said well i don't know about that
i don't think it would have been a
dictatorship but if you leave it open
and you say could have been an entirely
different country
then everybody who has a fear
can fill in that entirely different
country with whatever they're afraid of
that's why this is first-rate technology
i'm sorry persuasion
it doesn't look like vinman would be the
kind of
person who would be trained to come up
with that good of a sentence
it looks like he had help but that's
speculation
all right cnn
just became hilarious now if you didn't
see this news
apparently trump has amassed a hundred
million dollars in political funds
from fundraising mostly on his claims
about the
election not being uh not being
fair now he's got 100 million dollars i
think the next
biggest amount that any uh politician
had is tim scott
who's got like 8 million like not even
close
so if even if it's just money
that is the only way trump influences
things and of course it'll be more than
that
but he has so much money to influence
things that he can affect races
he can he can affect congress all kinds
of stuff
so cnn just went full panic on trump
partly because it's good for their
business model but check
out um check out the fox news
website front page and see what stories
they're covering
and then go to cnn and look at just all
the headlines and see what they're
covering today
it's not even the same planet now it's
common that they cover the news
differently
that's the most common thing but they
usually at least are talking about the
same stories
cnn isn't even on the same stories
because they've decided that the return
of trump
is like the the only story so let me
give you an idea of some of the things
these are just the headlines just from
today
on the cnn website and fox doesn't have
any of this yet
right so just from today uh
trump's 100 million dollar threat to
democracy
no he hasn't he hasn't raised 100
million dollars for his
political preferences it's a 100 million
dollar threat
to democracy democracy itself is going
to be attacked
with trump's 100 million dollars right
so that's a cnn headline
uh here's the funniest one and i didn't
click the article to read it
so i don't know what the article said
but i do know what the article said
and i'm going to read you the headline
and you also didn't read the article
but you know what the article says okay
here's the headline
she survived attack by jonestown cult
members
hear what she says about trump
that's an actual headline on cnn
she survived the jonestown cult members
hear what she says about trump
now if this is not cnn becoming a parody
of itself i don't know what is
but here's another one the disgraced
ex-president
is raising enormous sums on the power of
a lie
that is fundamentally altering politics
the disgraced ex-president disgraced
ex-president can't you say that about
everybody
couldn't you say the disgraced current
president
you just throw in that disgraced part
and people will accept it uncritically
i'm going to throw it and start throwing
in disgrace every time i talk about a
politician
so the disgraced
nancy pelosi was talking to the
disgraced
joe manchin i don't know just throw in
anybody joe manchin is not
not disgraced but we'll just throw in
disgrace
make you think that's the fact all right
here's another one uh from cnn headlines
video shows texas family
pleading with officer on top of black
teen
is it my imagination or did we have an
absence of police officers
on the backs of black teens for several
months during the
first part of the biden administration
but now
as soon as trump is back in the news
there's a cop on a black kid's back
just right when you right when you'd
expect it
the moment the moment
that trump is is a fear
well there's a cop on a black person's
back
happened right on time um which by the
way
just to be clear you know
any of this stuff is a tragedy so i'm
not making fun of the event itself
i'm just making fun of cnn for
discovering
certain kinds of stories just when they
need to be discovered
um here's another one democrats
increased pressure to act on eviction
moratorium
and one congresswoman slept on the
capitol steps
now the democrats increase pressure to
act on eviction moratorium
that sounds kind of dry doesn't it you
know
where are words like disgraced and
threat to democracy
well let me ask you this if trump had
been
president and let's say republicans
controlled congress
and we were in the same place we are now
with the
uh the moratorium on uh rents
sort of running out do you think that
the news would treat
trump this this dryly i think they say
trump is trying to put people on the
streets and favor landlords
this would be completely different news
if trump had been
president but but as long as the
democrats are in charge it's just
it's just something they're working on a
little headline some are working on
and then there was some mocking of the
arizona audit of course because they got
to hit that pretty hard all right
so here's some uh breaking news
from uh yasi gestetner um
so i guess this was a.g rosen said that
back when he was the acting eg if i got
this right i'm reading it for the first
time
said that the dog will look into
allegations in pennsylvania
but this is what he had said to trump
back in that phone call that was
reported
but the dog can't overturn the results
even if there are issues to this
trump said i don't expect you to do that
over to the results
just say that the election was corrupt
so a little clarification there so trump
was not trying to
overturn the results he was just trying
to get them to say that it was corrupt
um and i don't think they said that so
i feel like this is a story of
everything working the way it was
supposed to work
isn't that weird what would you what
would you hope
to happen if let's say the trump
truly believed that the election was
stolen i think that's fair
don't you think he actually believes it
right like i don't think he's just
making it up
i think he literally believes it and he
might be right we don't know
we don't there's no evidence to prove
he's right but there's no evidence to
prove he's wrong
either so i'd say that's an unknown
and suppose you had
a a president who believed really
believed
that the election was corrupt what would
he do about it
what would be the most reasonable thing
to do about it well if he really
believed it
he would certainly talk about it in
public but he would also
talk to his ag and maybe get the
attorney general to
to help out on what he thought was the
right thing
now again we're not going to talk about
whether it's the right thing
but he thought it was i think that's
fair to say and then the attorney
general
just didn't do it the attorney general
said no that's
apparently said no i'm not going to do
that and then he didn't do it
and it was fine isn't that exactly the
way the system is supposed to work
the president who legitimately believes
there's a big problem
tries to get as many people to get on
his side that's supposed to work that
way
right you get people on your side to
help you make your case
this person said no in my professional
capacity
this would be the wrong thing to do and
that he doesn't do it
everything about this is something
working the way you'd want it to work
am i wrong you might not like how things
went
but didn't the system work just the way
you want it to
people legitimately going after a
problem
maybe they're wrong about it being a
problem but legitimately they thought it
was a problem
and went after it in all the right ways
you know that obviously the protests and
the capital were out of control
that violence is condemned by everyone
but certainly it makes sense to try to
get people involved and get opinions and
then
then the professional whose job it was
to be objective
said he's not going to do that that's
just what you want
it's sort of like a story about nothing
happening i don't know
so anyway uh cnn's doing the whole uh
uh trump is the monster under the bed
routine
rasmussen says that 75 of liberals
say you should be required to wear a
mask
in public even if you already had covet
so 75 liberals say you should wear a
mask
even if you've already had covet
now the latest information is that if
you've already had it you can't get it
and you can't spread it
75 percent of liberals think you should
wear a mask in the context of you can't
get it and you can't spread it
according to science
now now when i say you can't get it and
can't spread it there's always an
exception but
exceptions are too small to matter in
this case
how do you explain that do you think
that
if all you did is reverse which
presidents were saying what
that that would just reverse is is that
based on
any kind of science that's the least
scientific thing i've ever seen in my
life
but worse 29 of conservatives agree
almost almost a third of conservatives
also think you should wear a mask if
you've already recovered from
coronavirus
what's going on here seriously what's
going on
i don't understand it is it because they
don't
know the facts
is it is it pure brainwashing
is there no rational thought about this
whatsoever
and what news what news entity is
telling them
to do this is i don't even think cnn is
telling anybody to wear a mask if
they've been vaccinated
are they is there some does fouchy even
say that
i mean fouchy wants everybody masked but
nobody believes him right
are they believing fouchy
i don't even understand this i don't
know how you can get this number
so it's sort of mind-bending so the
arizona state senate
has requested uh some kind of technical
review sort of an audit
of the dominion systems uh
was dominion software or hardware too
somebody tell me in the comments is the
dominion are they hardware and software
or just one or the other
probably both i'm seeing both thanks
thank you for that so they're both
hardware and software and they've
declined of course
um and there's they're saying that the
people doing the audit are not qualified
and therefore why release all their
information
and you know what this feels like
i don't want to make too much of the
analogy this is just something that
feels like something else it doesn't
mean you should draw a conclusion
but it feels exactly like trump's taxes
doesn't it
because the reason that you know that
the obvious thing that you
you wonder if trump doesn't want to
release his taxes
you say to yourself well that means
there's a problem in there right
if you don't want to release your taxes
that be that's because you know there's
a problem in there something illegal
right
no no that's what very inexperienced
people think
the reason you don't uh release your
taxes
is that people will imagine there are
problems in it
if they can't see them they can't make
stuff up based on you know
anything they just have to really just
purely speculate
but as soon as the actual taxes are
available
people are going to look at them and
they will report to you that there's a
crime in there
even if there isn't so there's a hundred
percent chance
that bad people will say there is a
crime and it's right there in the taxes
and you could look for yourself if you
had the taxes and you know what to look
for
so the odds of fake news coming out of
trump's tax returns is 100
it's 100 you are
guaranteed that there will be some
i don't know how many but there will be
some fake news
based on trump's taxes and it will be
well in line number 17 he clearly
did whatever and then if you ever looked
at it it wouldn't be that or it's not a
context or some damn thing
so anybody who argued that trump
should release his taxes if there's
nothing illegal in there
don't know anything about the world
that's not how the world works
people are going to find the problem
even if it's not there
it doesn't have to be there for them to
find it
you have have you been alive for the
last five years
it doesn't need to be there he just has
to release them
and then they'll say it's there and half
of the country
will believe whoever tells them that
they looked at it and they said well
there's a problem there
now dominion has the same freaking
problem
does dominion have a problem that
they're hiding
what do you think are they hiding a
problem
can't tell you know your your suspicious
nature is oh huh
if somebody doesn't want to be
transparent
they're hiding a problem but imagine if
they let all that stuff out
do you think that there would be a
let's say a cyber expert who would look
at their code
and find a vulnerability yes
yes a hundred percent chance even a
vulnerability they've never they're not
even aware of
if if any large complicated system
released their all their ip to anybody
who wanted to look at it
all of it would be imperfect people
would find bugs
all over the place every time windows
releases a new release somebody finds a
major security bug
you don't think microsoft looked at it
carefully before they released it
they did they had a lot of people look
at it
and then they released it and almost
every time
there's some major bug or you know
vulnerability
so so you've got this weird situation
where dominion in order to
have the business that they have they
have to convince the public
that they're a credible organization
with no major problems
their problem is they can't convince us
they're credible if they don't release
their code because there's no
transparency
but they also can't convince us they're
credible
if they do release their code they have
two ways to lose
and no way to win just like trump
if he doesn't release his tax returns
you assume the worst
if he does release his tax returns fake
news will tell you the worst
even if it's not there just like
dominion
you're going to find all kinds of
problems there even if there aren't any
it doesn't matter if there's a problem
there oh we'll find one
and it will be probably along the lines
of
well there's this vulnerability we don't
have any way of knowing it was exploited
but it's there so
was it a fair election we can't know
we can't know because you can't tell
and i've said this before if you if you
have a system that's unauditable
for any reason you didn't really have an
election
let me say that again if your election
is
unauditable for any reason and ours are
because there's there's no audit of the
hardware and software component
if you haven't done that you haven't
really done the audit you can you can
look at
corners of things you know you can you
can count a lot of things
check ballots whatever but if you
haven't checked the electronic systems i
don't know that you wanted it and
therefore it's not even a real election
in my
my opinion it's just something happened
and a president
took office was it an election we don't
know
if we if we could audit it we would know
but we can't
we can't audit it um
uh in the comments on you suggested long
ago we should give up the right of
privacy
to allow the audit yeah that would help
i mean um
i don't know if you have to give up the
right yeah you'd have to give up the
right of privacy or would you
because all you really need is for
everybody to be able to check their own
vote
does that give you does that give up the
right of privacy
because i could imagine that you would
have maybe a code that only you knew
that's matched with the code in the
database
so you could check your code against the
database to see if you voted
you'd still be anonymous or would that
be too much of a vulnerability
somebody says you can do this in
colorado so apparently it's doable
yeah and it's not like everybody has to
do it you just have to have enough
people do it
to to catch any fraud
all right let's see what else we got
going on here
uh aoc is threatening to kill the
infrastructure bill
now i made a prediction that uh the
infrastructure bill
is just going to be sort of the forever
never done bill
now i don't know how long forever goes
but
every time every time you see a headline
that says it looks like we've got a
breakthrough
on the infrastructure bill looks like we
got some bipartisan movement now
no every time you see anything about
infrastructure
about ready to get signed a little
recording in the back of your head
should say
probably not so uh
so aoc is threatening to kill the bill
with her
with her pack of people who agree with
her uh based on the fact that it's
not liberal enough in the sense that it
doesn't have enough
uh goodies in there uh
dominion yeah dominion means sovereignty
over
which is unfortunate name for a voting
company
um electric helicopters
oh there's somebody's somebody's really
electric helicopters
um i can't wait for my electric
helicopter
all right so that's all i got for today
not much happening there
and just go look at your comments for a
moment see if there's anything i missed
prediction on the governor's race you
know i need to check in on the polls i
haven't seen any polls of
california's governor race uh the the
recall race
i don't i don't know if larry elder is
within striking distance or not but i'll
check into that
uh yeah i i decided to go whole day
without talking about bill maher
uh larry elders has 16 percent yeah
but that's but but once it gets down to
i'm not sure how the election the recall
works but once we once you feel it's
really between two people
that's when it gets interesting
it's not vulnerable somebody's saying
take it from an aeronautical engineer
electric helicopters air taxis are not
going to happen soon
well stephen um i'm going to disagree
with you there
about electric airplanes and electric
taxis because the the only gaining
factor
is the battery capacity and weight
right and battery capacity and weight
are are reaching some critical
crossover points so i think we're really
close to the crossover
where the battery technology is good
enough but has never been
it has never been good enough up to this
point
um yeah so the weight of the batteries
is going to be a big deal
uh somebody says airlines are actually
ordering electric land
planes for delivery years out i'll bet
that's true
the lightest electric car is over a ton
somebody says uh
what's the breaking news it wasn't
breaking it was just
an update on the uh what trump said
to the attorney general
back in the day
um
one flight around the tesla tower and is
fully charged
yeah i don't think so um
what's the smallest a nuclear reactor
can get well they're small enough to be
on
naval ships and small enough to be in
um satellites right aren't satellites
nuclear powered some of them
alyssa is asking me if i'm cue
no i'm not
all right
a lot of different topics coming by here
in the comments
but i think we're done for today and i
will talk to you
tomorrow assuming youtube works
