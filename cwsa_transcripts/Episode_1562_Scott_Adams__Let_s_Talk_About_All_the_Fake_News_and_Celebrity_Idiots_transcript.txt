good morning everybody
what an amazing day
amazing for a monday even yeah i don't
want to go all garfield the cat on you
but uh
some people think mondays are terrible
no no not here
here the mondays are great every time
and
if you'd like to take it up another
notch
yeah you do yeah you do
all you need is what a copper mug or
glass
i'll take your chance to sign a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
yeah
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it make your antibodies come alive
go
yeah did you feel that i think you did
well we got all kinds of fun news today
the good kind
well it depends on your point of view
whether it's good or just interesting
uh this is not good but it's interesting
according to the bbc
there were heavy rains and flooding in
southern egypt
no problem a little bit of flooding a
little heavy rains but when you get
heavy rains in this part of southern
egypt apparently
it drives all the scorpions out of their
hiding holes
and so 500 people were hospitalized with
scorpion bites and a few people died
now when i heard that uh
southern egypt is having problems with
scorpion swarms
i said to myself
well how do i get some of those
because i live in california and if
there's a disaster that can happen we
want it so we got our energy shortage we
got our water shortage we got our
massive forest fires we've got the
homeless the people dying on the streets
we've got the covid
and
a few other things we got your
earthquakes but what we don't have is
scorpion swarms
and i feel like we need to catch up a
little bit so playing catch up to
southern egypt
we gotta get us some hidden scorpions to
come out during the rain
all we have are mudslides and i don't
think that's good enough
well today uh the written house
jury will be deciding on the case
apparently the charges have been uh
reduced
or at least a
a request has been made to consider
additional charges of a lesser kind
now here's a story that jonathan turley
was behind i saw this on fox news
channel
apparently
um
did you know that the judge can't figure
out what the gun ownership law is in
wisconsin
that's right the judge
who is trained for years to read legal
documents and to know what they mean
said directly that he can't understand
what the law even says
on gun ownership
because it's written so poorly you're
not even entirely sure what's legal and
what's not
and apparently kyle rittenhouse
gave the prosecutor a little lesson on
wisconsin's gun laws
i i didn't see it but there was an
exchange
in which uh
kyle knew that he could not own a
handgun
because he was too young
but you can own a hunting rifle at his
age and that's the one he had in his
possession or you can at least you know
have it on your procession
and
kyle actually explained to the
prosecutor as if the prosecutor didn't
already know it and i think maybe he
didn't that it would have been illegal
to have a handgun but perfectly legal
for him to have
a long
uh rifle
and apparently the prosecutor was
finding that out
at the trial
from the defendant
are you kidding me
now as turley points out and i think
this is a
this is just a given if the judge in his
best
effort can't understand the gun law
can he send it to the jury
no
no
not in any world
can the judge instruct the jury to
consider that law
because the judge doesn't understand the
law
that's real
have you ever heard of this
now i'm sure
people who are you know legal scholars
and lawyers have heard of something like
this but i haven't
have you ever heard
the judge not understanding a law
because the law is so poorly written
that oh he threw it down already
has that already happened
oh i'm saying in the comments that he
threw it down already
well that that's what i was going to
predict right it was an easy prediction
that he would throw that out
or will be thrown out
okay so i guess we're i'm not clear what
has or has not happened
will be thrown out i guess is the
is the answer hasn't been yet okay
so
um
the
national guard
put 500 troops into kenosha
just in case there's some writing after
the verdict
now
here's a way to reframe this same
statement
and see if this doesn't
disgust you
why is it that we need 500 national
guard
why do we need 500 national guards well
in case of trouble
but why is there a possibility of
trouble
is there a possibility of trouble
because of what kyle did
not really
because what he did was self-defense
is there a possibility of trouble
because the fake news industry
has convinced people that justice will
not be served because he's white
yes they have
try to
now now let me connect the dots here
there are 500 national guard people
deployed
because of the fake news
is that statement incorrect or perfectly
correct
we have 500 national guard deployed
strictly because of the fake news
not because of anything kyle did because
at this point we know he didn't do
anything and presumably the
the jury will
either decide that or decide some lesser
charge that will make people mad anyway
have we ever seen this before
is this the first time we can say with
complete clarity that the national guard
were called out
to uh protect against the fake news
we called out
the national guard to protect
against the fake news
that's happening right now
and do you know who's gonna say that on
the news nobody
because it's the news and they
can tell you anything is news and you'll
believe it the news is the reason there
are 500 people to protect us from each
other
the news did this to us nobody else kyle
didn't do this the people who attacked
kyle didn't do this
nobody did this
except the fake news
and we need 500 national guard to keep
us from tearing each other apart because
of the fake news
who else is going to tell you this today
probably nobody
i'm probably the only person who will
tell you this
and when you hear it you say to yourself
oh that's true isn't it
it's not about anything that the actors
did it's just the news that's the only
reason that we will be we'll be at each
other and if somebody dies today
or tonight
it's because of the news it's not
because of kyle
all right
remember i told you that
i used to rewrite my lawyers
the shorter documents i didn't do this
with the longer
you know big
big stakes kind of stuff but on shorter
documents i would just rewrite the
legalese into english and my lawyer
would look at and say uh okay that
basically says the same thing
um
and here's this law about guns in
wisconsin they're so complicated because
of the legalese presumably
that uh you can't even understand it
well
in other news
epstein's uh partner uh
whose first name is either pronounced
geelane
or g-h-i-s
i prefer to pronounce it jizz so jizz
lane
maxwell
she's going
she's going to trial and
i wonder if this is going to change
everything
don't you wonder that
because whatever comes out of this trial
is going to be
surprising
but maybe surprising in an unsurprising
way you know what i mean
this could change everything in the
world
couldn't it
because depending on what name she
decides to drop
countries could fall
is that too much
i think well not countries but
governments i think governments might
fall
because of this trial
i mean i don't know for sure
but it looks like governments might fall
um it could be that big
so we'll see but anyway i um
if anybody had a more perfect name for
their crime
i would call her jizz lane maxwell she
maximized the jizz lane
for epstein and boy did she do that
well i'm introducing a new segment today
i call dumb celebrities
dumb celebrities you ready
dumb celebrity number one deborah
messing
she tweeted two charts
one showing that unemployment
unemployment claims are way down
compared to the trump administration and
the stock market is up
and she says
in her tweet
and she tweets at the senate gop house
gop and the gop leaders because she
wants the gop to know this then she puts
it in all caps
now if a celebrity uses all caps
well you really have to pay attention to
that
so in all claps she says
just to be clear
just to be clear people just to be clear
all caps
this means potus is doing a fantastic
job all caps fantastic job
right
i mean
these two charts
show that biden's doing a fantastic job
right right it's obvious isn't it right
right hey everybody it's obvious
no
and then she goes
i'll wait
i'll wait because it's so obvious
according to her graphs the biden's
doing a fantastic job
hashtag biden hashtag biden delivers
so i responded to this and say it and
said
uh
no it just means there was a pandemic
that's it it just means there was a
pandemic
and if uh trump had been president you
know through the pandemic until now
the stock market would have been up
and uh the unemployment claims would be
down compared to where they were
so here's a celebrity who honestly can't
tell the difference
between coming out of a pandemic and
doing a good job
she couldn't tell the difference
and she thinks it's so obvious that she
can do it in caps and be sarcastic about
it and
sort of dunk on you
because you don't understand
how good a job biden's doing
even though the numbers don't show
anything like that
all right
dumb celebrities number two ben and
jerry's now they don't own ben jerry's
anymore they sold it but they're still
in the news
and
they're usually in the news because
they're telling us how to be better
people
am i right
that's sort of ben and jerry's thing how
to be better people
on this world better
better caretakers of the planet just
better people
ben and jerry's became millionaires by
selling ice cream to fat people
and they're here to tell us how to be
better people
well one way to be a better person i'm
just going to put that out here
if you're looking for ways to be a
better person don't sell ice cream to
fat people
no don't do that
because that's not good for them
it's the number one health problem
so it turns out that the left
and even the
the deep left
is starting to have some doubts about
the
honesty of their own media
they're starting to catch on
that's right people on the left are
starting to suspect
just getting a little hint
that maybe not all of the news they're
hearing on social media as well as the
news
maybe it's not all
100 accurate
case in point
a member of the young turks
anna
uh
in a
gasboro
um
yeah i think it's you know
yeah anna kasparian
um
she basically did a did a piece in which
she said uh her understanding of the
written house trial
had changed completely because
apparently the
media had bamboozled her
so if even the young turks is realizing
that the news is lying to them
i feel like that's some deep penetration
of the idea that the news is not real
the right knows this clearly the left
still is figuring it out
but they're starting to figure it out
well do you follow how many of you read
axios
it's a news a newer news source axios
i'm going to give them a little shout
out today i do read them um it's one of
the
one of the ones i try to hit every day
but
and one of the reasons i do it is i'm
trying to figure out where cnn and fox
news are getting it wrong
because axios tends to be a little bit
more balanced
i don't know maybe sometimes they're not
so i but um i will note that they
apparently were not part of the fake
reporting on the steele dossier
how about that
that's worth a shadow now i did a fact
check on this this is a claim from axios
right so one of axios's writers
josh crushauer
he's talking about her reckoning is
hitting news organizations for the years
old coverage of the steele dossier
but uh i don't remember if josh said it
or somebody else said it in the article
that axios itself had not
had not taken the bait and the steele
dossier is that true
can anybody confirm that that they did
not take the bait on that they may have
covered it as a story that's been
covered but i don't know that they
treated it as real at any point
anyway
um
there you know they're talking about how
the news organizations need to deal with
it apparently some of them are just
going back and changing the original
reporting and adding some clarifiers
you know instead of saying well we were
wrong we lied to you
not only did we lie to you we got
pulitzer prizes for lying to you in one
case
and uh so the the fake news industry is
just trying to hide their
their awfulness
all right rasmussen had a poll in which
they asked do you trust political news
you're getting
what do you think people said
what percentage do you think of
registered voters
or i think they usually do likely voters
um
what percentage do you think
trust the political news
25
okay
[Laughter]
okay you're way ahead of me
yeah it turns out it's 33
trust trust the political news
but remember i always tell you that
something something in the neighborhood
of 25 percent of the public gets every
question wrong
and i don't know if it's the same one i
don't know if it's the same 25 every
time maybe it depends on the topic
but sure enough
33 of the country actually trusts the
political news
now this isn't even a left right thing
is it
i i don't think this has to do with the
left or the right how could you possibly
trust the political news
how could you be alive for the last five
years and say yeah i think the political
news is usually pretty accurate
how could you possibly think that
um
all right
i guess biden is preparing to
have a zoom meeting with
china's uh president xi
xi jinping
how do you think that's going to go
i can't think of anything that would be
more of a waste of time
than biden and president xi talking over
zoom
and speaking a different language
how would that how is that ever going to
work
now i get that you know it's a pandemic
and everything so we do things
differently but don't we all agree that
an in-person meeting feels completely
different than a zoom
that's still true right or have we
evolved to the point where and a zoom
meeting is just as good
i don't think we have
i feel that
there's something about us as human
beings that makes
personal contact
more substantial
so i think that maybe having zoom
meetings would be good at lower levels
of government
but i don't know
i don't even know if this is good
i mean i suppose we have to have
continual contact and
let them know what we're thinking but
there's no way that this is going to
make anything better because i don't
think zoom does that
or whatever whatever they're using won't
be zoomed
i guess the trump hotel
trump international in washington d.c
is getting sold
i ch i stayed at the trump international
in washington dc when i visited
president trump
and it was one of the worst hotels i've
ever stayed in
i got to tell you
my room was maybe the worst room i've
been in in years
why
first of all my room didn't have a
window
at
below
below personal level
so there was like a raised couple of
windows
that you couldn't see through but
they're up high
and
we got a notice
we got to notice while i was staying
there that we should keep those drapes
closed
because the window washers were working
so the only light from the outside into
this room was these little high up
windows that i had to keep the drapes
closed
so i basically sat in a darkened
darkened unimpressive room
until it was time for my meeting
yeah it's the old post office building i
guess
so
the lobby and br area are are attractive
that's true
yes the down the downstairs is quite
attractive also when i was there i
didn't see many other people
it did seem like it was a little bit
empty when i was there i didn't see
people in the hallways etc
um so i would say that the trumps are
smart to get rid of that hotel
that would be not exactly the jewel in
the crown of their holdings
so good for them getting rid of that
remember i told you that uh i i know the
new news before you do
i'll just give you a teaser
tomorrow you're going to see a poll
uh on politics so i'll just tell you
that the topic is politics
and the
the result
has been described as
and i quote
stunning
stunning
so you're going to see a poll result
tomorrow
that
has been described by somebody who's
seen it as
stunning
and i have enough information about it
that it's going to be stunning
but so basically
wait for that all right
have i told you before that one way to
uh
persuade
especially persuading people who are
hard to persuade
uh is
no it's a professional poll it's not
it's not one of my twitter polls it's a
professional poll
have i told you that one way to
persuade is to enter somebody's frame
if their frame is absurd
so if somebody's making a world view
claim that's absurd
arguing against it hey that's not real
or you're looking at it wrong hardly
ever works
but sometimes you can enter their frame
and show them how absurd it is from the
inside and you have to hear examples of
this
so here's an example uh bernie sanders
as you know was having this little
exchange with elon musk about taxes and
what your fair share is
and
what bernie would like you to know
is that rich people should pay their
quote fair share
now that's the absurd
frame that bernie has because there's no
such thing as fair
it literally is just an opinion doesn't
mean anything there's no standard for
fair
so
instead of arguing against fair
which would be impossible
you do the opposite you embrace it
and you say you know bernie i think we
should have fair taxation
so let's figure out since fairness is a
somewhat subjective you'd agree with
that wouldn't you bernie
hey bernie
would you agree that fairness is not an
objective standard
rather it's subjective would you agree
with that
i think you get them to say yes
yes you know it when you see it
wouldn't you say it's sort of like art
fairness is something you know when you
see it
you don't need to be too technical about
it you just know it when you see it are
we agreed
bernie
bernie can you agree with me that
ordinary people will will recognize
fairness
and they will certainly recognize
unfairness when they see it can we agree
on that
because we both think fairness
is how the tax system should be done
absolutely it should be fair
so how would we figure out what is
fair how would you go about that
well i have a suggestion that i think
bernie would love
you do a poll
now i did a little uh
you know sample poll of this on twitter
so this is the non-scientific version of
a poll
and i said to the public what is the
closest to the quote fair share
of all taxes combined
that the top 1 percent should pay now if
people read it carefully they'd see all
taxes combined
i'm going to read this
49.99 comment and then go back to it he
paid a lot of money for this on on
youtube
scott scott for a man who insists on
attempting to persuade his audience that
all pertinent knowledge is unknowable
why do you nonetheless persist in its
to what level of futility are we
engaging with here
so i'm telling you that all information
is hard to trust
so what's the point of talking about it
is that your point i'm not sure i quite
understand the point but you paid almost
fifty dollars for it so
i thought i'd give it some attention now
i'm going to say the thing the same
thing that viva fry says on his show all
the time
i don't encourage you
to do the super chats
i don't encourage you to do that i
appreciate it i mean
nobody says no to money
but i don't i don't encourage it because
i'm not sure you get your money's worth
out of that
anyway
so i did a little poll on twitter and
said to people in your opinion what
would be the fair share of all taxes now
all taxes combined it was my question
and that would include federal estate
um in you know in every every form of
taxation now how much do the top one
percent pay
let's say me i'll use me for example
what do you think i pay in terms of
taxes if you looked at all my taxes so
i've got california state taxes that are
sky high i've got federal
then i've got property tax i've got
sales tax
auto tax everything else
what do you think i pay
yeah it's probably 60
probably 60 tax rate
something like that it might be a lot
higher but i think it's around 60
now of
of the money i earn
it takes 60 away
of the 40 that i that i earn how much of
that do i spend
on my own consumption
what do you think
how much of the money i earn
is my own consumption
very little
because i don't need that much and i
have a high income
so
is that fair is it fair that the
government takes 60 and then what's left
uh other people who are not working take
90
and i'm left with about 10
is it fair that i get to keep 10 of my
money
working
every day for 30 years
do i get to keep 10
is that is that does that seem okay to
you
that i work every day
every day
for 35 years do i get to keep 10
that would seem
does that is that okay 10
all right so here's how you deal with
bernie you say bernie let's settle this
let's ask the country to tell us what
the top one percent would pay i asked
the same question by on twitter
and one percent of the people
oh no i'm sorry
29 answered that the top one percent
should pay one percent
that if you're the top one percent
you should pay one percent of
of the tax bill
the real number is 40 of just the
federal tax
so so that that's the current taxes
forty percent the top one percent are
paying forty percent of all the tax bill
for the whole country
but if you ask people what is fair
only eighteen percent said that forty
percent would be fair and keep in mind i
said combined taxes
so the people who say 40 is fair are
really
saying 40 is fair but the rich are
actually playing closer to 60.
so even that is 50 lower than the
current tax rates
for some of us
19 said it should be 30 percent 34
percent said it should be 20
and 29 percent
should be 1
so in other words
over 60 percent
thought it should be way way less than
it currently is
to be fair
so let's ask bernie
to figure out what is fair by asking the
public
a nice random sample not a not a rigged
pole like minus
but a random sample and then we'll say
okay if that's fair
let's go with that because you know
what's going to happen
is that if you ask the public what's
fair they will come up with a number
that's not even close
to what the rich people actually pay it
won't even be close now i've done this
this kind of uh you know unscientific
poll before so i know
that people don't have any idea
how much taxes rich people pay you have
no idea
and by the way
you know
almost all rich people are supporting
lots of other people
me included
do you know how many rich peop how many
uh people are supported by every rich
person every one rich person
it's a lot
it's a lot
anyway
uh dave portnoy you know his uh his
situation over at barstool
um the
media entity barstool
and uh he was the subject of a hit piece
recently by business insider about his
sex life
but
because
i guess they picked the wrong guy
if you're the media and you're going to
go after somebody
don't go after somebody who is this good
in public and has this big a
media platform
i i mean
you know it's sort of like
by analogy it's sort of like
taking a run at the king
if you can't put him down
and they didn't
they tried to put portnoy down if you
don't put him down
he's going to get stronger
and i think that's what's happening
so now a second entity looks like they
allegedly maybe taken a run at a second
hit piece that looks like it was
assigned about the same time
so at about the same time as the
business insider hit piece on his love
life
there was a separate one on his quote
alleged
toxic workplace
one of the odds that this one media
figure dave portnoy would be the subject
of two
hip pieces
on the two most critical parts of his
life you know his personal life and then
his business separately and they would
be assigned at the same time
none of this is an accident
right this is the democrats
picking off um
important voices on who maybe trump
supporters or at least even leading that
direction
now i told you that they've already made
a run at me
and there will be more
before the election of 2024 watch how
many hit pieces either happen without my
involvement about me
and how many they try i'll tell you when
they try because i'll be turning them
down
because they like they like to get you
on the record so that they can misquote
you
that's why they do it by the way the
reason they would want to spend time
with the subject of the hippies
is to get the subject to say things that
they can misquote
and if you think that i'm kidding about
that not at all
at all that is the game the game is the
misquote
that's everything they're looking for is
a misquote now when i say misquote i
mean that includes out of context it
doesn't mean actually changing the words
they said they don't always do that but
they can change the context to make it
into something it isn't
project veritas
you know that the government has
targeted them because we don't have a
government that is legitimate anymore at
least the fbi is not legitimate in my
opinion and our intel agencies are not
legitimate so we have a pretty
illegitimate government at this point
but even the as uh as a hermit dylan
attorney
points out she's the attorney for uh
project veritas i believe
uh points out that even the aclu
who you expect to be you know far far
far left
even they say okay this is too far
that the radon project veritas
uh that even the aclu is condemning the
fbi raid on them that
do you know how far
do you know how far you have to go
before the aclu will back somebody on
the right
you have to really be bad
before the aclu will say damn it
we're going to have to take the side of
the right
this time it's going to be too obvious
if we don't
bad
um
did you notice the cnn has gone uh
guns hot on kamala harris
so if you look at the top left of cnn's
website that's where they put the news
they want you to notice the most all
websites put the important stuff in the
top left if they know what they're doing
the the entire top left is about how
kamala harris is incompetent
on cnn
not one story
multiple stories
on cnn
about the vice president's incompetence
especially your staff
more more focused on the staff but of
course that accrues to her as well
the cat is on the roof
it turns out that somebody's trying to
get rid of kamala harris and trying
pretty hard because she's been a
disaster there isn't any way she could
win a general election against really
anybody at this point
and
uh cnn is
to their credit
i think
they're going after hard now here's what
i think
i think cnn has orders from the
democratic party what do you think
i don't believe that cnn independently
said
let's take it let's take down harris
there's no way
that that's not a coordinated move with
somebody in the democratic party
so they're looking for the replacement
it's very clear
and they've got a problem because biden
probably can't last for another term
even if
you know it's unlikely you win
but she's certainly not going to be the
one and now they have to figure out who
is the one
and to figure out how to do that there's
some
there's some conversation that she would
be put on the supreme court just to open
her job for somebody else
i don't believe that one i don't see her
on the supreme court i don't think she's
got the weight for that that kind of
thing
all right there's a uh i saw a tweet by
dr joseph mercola he would be in the
category of those doctors i call the
rogue doctors
the doctors who are taking the
contrarian view on
pandemic related stuff so you may have
heard seen him on twitter dr joseph
mercola and he talks he tweets about a
story about a
school in
where is it somewhere in america there's
a school that had to close
because they didn't have enough teachers
including substitute teachers they
didn't have enough to keep the school
open
because of all the teachers who
complained and took sick days after
getting the booster shot
and so dr mercola says
you think they close schools due to
soreness at the injection site
do you think do you think that's why
everybody's calling in sick because
there's a little bit of soreness in the
arm
it's interesting i'm reading your
comment but i'm not going to talk about
that now
um
so what do you think is there any other
explanation for why this school would
have to close because so many teachers
were complaining of side effects from
the vaccination is there any other
explanation
for why a school would have to close
because so many teachers had to call in
sick after getting vaccinated any other
reason
or is the reason that the vaccinations
are and you shouldn't get them
is that the only reason
well i could come up with three
number one statistical clustering
meaning that on any given day
somewhere in the united states a lot of
teachers are sick at the same time in
one place
guaranteed
statistics are not smooth over all of
the places in the world
statistics are randomly you know usually
or could be randomly distributed but
even with random distribution
you're guaranteed if you have enough
let's say schools in this case if you
have lots and lots of schools
every day
one of those schools will have too many
teachers called insect
every day
so one explanation is
that nothing happened
you just a lot of people call in sick
every day some of them maybe had some
side effects from the vaccine not
impossible
but others may have just said i was not
feeling good today
here's another possible explanation
teachers are lying to get days off
do you think the teachers didn't know
that they could claim they had side
effects from the uh booster and get a
day off
of course they do
they knew that all they had to do was
say you know
i feel a little tired and shaky today
day off
and we live in a world in which
employees give themselves a vacation
days by claiming fake
illness
it's just routine
the entire country is filled with people
taking time off and claiming they're
sick
maybe it's just that because it's easy
to claim this and nobody's going to
question it
the other third possibility which would
explain what we see is a local mass
hysteria
when i say local
i mean
since only the town itself was aware of
this situation
it could be that one teacher had a real
problem and then the others thought i'm
feeling a little shaky and tired too
maybe i'd better take a day off
or it could be some combination of the
three things i mentioned or it could be
exactly
what dr joseph mercola suggests
he could be exactly right
that the vaccinations have more side
effects than are being reported
i'm just saying that when
when somebody asks you what else could
it be
make sure you know
the other possibilities because there
are other things it could be
and i don't know if they're they're even
less likely
they're certainly all possible
so that's your
lesson right there
um i continue to uh
i continue to come up with ways to um
identify npcs
now npcs would be non-player characters
and it it assumes that we live in a
simulation that's built like a like a
game
and this is not a base reality
now if that's true
and i think it's a trillion to one odds
that it is true
but if it's true
how do you find the characters that are
not actually player characters but
they're just sort of background scenery
i have four potential tells i'm not
convinced any of these are good or
i'm not convinced that npcs exist but
just for fun
this is just for fun right don't take
any of it too seriously
number one an npc is somebody who
wouldn't change their opinion even as
the data changes
because you imagine the npcs have less
programming
right they just don't have as many
options they just don't have the range
of action that a real person would have
so an npc would not change its opinion
even if the data
changes right
because they wouldn't have that
flexibility but a real player character
might
might change their mind if the data
changes all right
number two uh they have absolute
opinions as opposed to statistical
opinions it doesn't matter if they're on
the left or the right
but if they say for example
the election
was stolen 100
or if they say the election wasn't
stolen
100
that's an npc
it doesn't matter which side you're on
because we don't know
i mean the actual real person
uh way to look at is i don't know i mean
i i suspect it was stolen or probably
stolen or
probably not
now those are opinions that could be you
know right or wrong
but they're not npc opinions
they're just somebody who doesn't know
which is exactly the right
place to be
number three they don't have any stories
to tell
have you noticed that some people always
have stories
you could give me almost any topic and
i'll tell you a story in my life
that has some relationship to it now i'm
a writer so maybe it's easier for me
but
there are people who can't tell you a
story about anything
and
the suggestion here is that they've been
programmed without much history
so they don't have any
stories because they're npcs
and then the fourth one i'll just throw
this out to be uh
argumentative
they believe analogies are the same
things as as arguments
because if you're going to program your
npcs
you just say okay just follow patterns
just whatever the pattern is just do
that if you see a pattern
just trust it
so the npcs would see analogies as
meaning something whereas people who are
real people would see analogies as just
analogies
it's a different situation that might
tell you something about yours but it's
not an argument it's just a whole
different situation
also they're really bad at analogies
maybe
npcs in a video game also repeat
useful things to help you
complete your quest
so maybe they repeat themselves maybe
they only say a certain number of things
now the other oh i guess i should have
added a fifth
a fifth would be movie references as
opposed to
a useful
conversation so if somebody's saying to
you oh that's like the matrix or that's
uh
soylent green
there's a few other movies that people
always mention
wow bitcoin creator satoshi nakamoto
could be unmasked
at a florida trial
that's not that's got to be fake news
i'm saying i'm seeing something that
looks like fake news how in the world
could the creator of bitcoin be unmasked
that would that would uh
that's just not possible right
am i right
do i do i understand bitcoin well enough
to say
that you could never uncover
who it is in a court case unless you
actually had that person in court and
even then i'm not sure if it'd work
right
um
oh okay we do have a uh
erica is saying that the ridden house
gun charges have been dismissed
the gun charges have been dismissed
thank you what did i tell you the other
day
i told you that the our court system in
the united states is the jewel
of the republic
here here this might be a good example
i'm hoping that this goes the way
i would expect it to
uh wait a minute now i'm seeing somebody
else saying the opposite now the court
finds kyle ridden house lawfully carried
i'm sorry yes lawfully that's the same
um
they're going hard on the provocation
angle yeah
all right
so
um good for the court system if it comes
to the right conclusion and it looks
like it is i have some faith in this
judge
having watched the judge's operation
i feel like things are going to go the
right direction here
steve bannon turned himself in this
morning
[Music]
jail the prosecutor
i feel like i feel like that's warranted
it might be a bad precedent to put a
prosecutor in jail but there has to be
some limit
to bad behavior
and i don't know how you decide
objectively what that limit is but
my subjective opinion is that he crossed
it
um
the judge kind of looks like me
no he doesn't
you're just saying all bald white guys
with glasses look alike
well we do it's kind of true
what does it mean if it doesn't go in
the right direction well the jury can do
anything you know the jury can find
whatever they want so there's still some
risk
oh yeah so i i forgot about this story
so it turns out that pete butterjudge is
not in charge of the infrastructure
spending
did you know that
p buttage edge is not they apparently
some new guy has been appointed to be
the infrastructure czar
because buddha judge couldn't handle
that or it wasn't didn't make sense in
his portfolio
which is it
that's really not much of a uh
confidence and buddha judge is it
i wonder
i wonder if somebody's trying to keep
buddha judge from becoming president on
the democrat side
doesn't this feel like if anybody wanted
buddha judge to be president they would
give him the portfolio
right
am i wrong
if they wanted buddha judge to have a
high enough profile from his you know
boring job that he's in so that he could
run for president they would give him
the portfolio and make sure that you
knew he was the one making the decisions
i think the democrats just kneecapped
buddha judge
am i wrong
am i reading too much into that it could
be that buddha judge just had too much
you know on his plate for the normal job
and he couldn't handle it but it looks
like the democrats just took out kamal
harris
and took out buddha judge who are they
who are they making space for
they're making space for somebody aren't
they because biden's i don't there's no
chance biden is going to run again so if
they take down biden harris and bootage
who's left
now it's not going to be tulsi because
she's a little bit too too middle for
the
the left i think
not hillary not it's not going to be
michelle obama
not cory booker not john kerry
uh
aoc now
too soon max max seed water is now
isn't this interesting there has to be
some oh newsome
i would love to see uh newsome's poll
numbers
he might act
you know newsom is somebody to worry
about if you're a republican to worry
about because he has some serious game
he's really really good at the politics
stuff in my opinion now i'm not happy
with
you know what he's done to california
but he's definitely good at it
that's for sure
um
he will turn off independence maybe
mcauliffe i doubt it
yeah isn't this interesting that we
can't think of one person on the
democrat side
who would make a suitable present
now do the same experiment
except with the republicans
and say to yourself okay
if it's not trump
do they have any strong candidates
yeah
all kinds of them
so i mean you start with desantis you'd
be the obvious one
tom cotton
strong rand paul strong
um
yeah i mean
and i would bet you could come up tim
scott strong
yeah it would be pretty easy to come up
with
a number of republicans that you think
could be in the fight
well i can't think of a democrat that
would even
be able to land a punch
gretchen whitmer
i don't know
um
pompeo yeah even pompeo
would be at least a serious candidate
for president you wouldn't be my first
choice
all right i think we've reached the
point where i've done such a good job
oh joe manchin
that's interesting but i don't think the
democrats would support manchin
so i don't think he can get there
so am i wrong that uh there's a gigantic
lane for somebody to create the middle
party
so the problem with andrew yang and the
problem with anybody who does a third
party is it looks like a third party
am i right
third parties look like where people who
are just sick of their party
and have given up on being productive
you know go for their protest vote and
as long as you frame it that way it's
going to stay that way and i think yang
has somewhat accidentally
framed his you know third party appeal
very narrowly
i'm not even entirely sure what you'd
call his proposition but imagine you
said i'm going to form the middle party
and i'm going to go after the
the moderate democrats and the moderate
republicans and i'm going to acknowledge
that they don't agree even though
they're they're both closer to the
middle i'm going to acknowledge that
they don't agree
but i'm going to have them fight it down
in public
we'll have a series of debates with the
moderates versus the moderates and
and we'll publicize it and i'll uh i'll
help you you know sort out what's true
and then we'll try to come up with
compromises
and we'll just ignore the far left and
the far right as both equally
not useful
now imagine if instead of
demonizing the right the far right
or demonizing the left the far left
suppose you said everybody in the middle
is cool
and that you're the middle party and you
invite them all in democrats cool
as long as you're toward the middle
republicans cool independence you're all
in
you're all cool the people on the far
left and the far right i will simply
dismiss this way
they're not useful
they're not useful to you
they're not useful to the country
they're not even useful to themselves
as soon as you get into the details you
lost
you know what they believe and the
wokeness and all that as soon as you
start arguing that you're on their own
home territory
instead
just say the middle party is exclusively
going to engage with people who are
trying to be useful
and those who are clearly not trying to
be useful
will just ignore
no no prejudice they're all americans
and they need to be taken care of they
have a vote just like everybody else so
they get full respect
but you don't need to satisfy them
because they're not part of the useful
middle
well actually how about this
uh change the name of the party to the
useful middle
not just even middle
the useful middle two words
how would you not want to be in that
category
would you not want to be in the useful
middle
um
i mean that's where i'd want to be i'd
want to be in the useful middle because
it frames the everything else as being
not useful
even if you believe they're they're
things it's just not useful
now high energy party too generic
uh defined far right
far right i would say the racists
so i would say that the far right the
farthest right
and the farthest left are both just
racists
what do you think of that framing
that the farthest right you know the
extreme and the farthest left are just
racists
and why would you engage racists on
either party
as soon as you get into the like the the
policy differences
how useful is that not very
somebody says wrong
tyrannical
um the useful party i think you need the
useful middle
somehow that middle
adds something i think
the shrink government party yeah good
luck with that
um
all right
i think i've done enough so youtube i'm
gonna say goodbye right now and i'll
talk to you
tomorrow i hope you enjoyed hope you
enjoyed the show
