camera I've got
my solo here we go there we
go just took me a while I knew I could
get
[Music]
[Music]
it good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scot I'm pretty sure
there's never been a better time in your
whole life today not only our regular
show but toward the end I'm going to do
a interview with author Carmen Simon and
you're going to want to see that to
learn more about how to be more
effective communicator and Persuader
with a new book called made you look
available now for for order all right if
you'd like to take this experience up to
a level that nobody can even understand
all you need is a cuper marker glass a
Tiner chal a a canteen suar flask of
Asen and fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dope of
being the end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now
go oh that's so
good gets better every time I
think well I'm going to start a movement
and I hope you all join me
I think this is very important I
realized recently I just learned that
the name New York Yankees is racist and
I'm going to start a movement to make
them change their names to something
less
offensive now if you don't know the
background Yankees is uh actually a
Dutch
slur so apparently the Dutch were the
original um settlers in New York City
and and the Dutch often have names that
sound like keys or
Yan and so it was a Dutch slur to call
them the
yanes or the New York Yankees or the dam
Yankees if you want to be super racist
and so as someone who has a nonzero
amount of Dutch blood in me I insist
that the New York Yankees change their
name to something far less
less
offensive I would say and they could
keep the the general concept it's just
you can't be
Yankees I was thinking
Yankers what do you think the New York
Yankers no all right that's just that's
just brainstorming that's just my first
idea don't don't get too committed to
that you might know that Jack dorsy
after he left uh what was Twitter was
working on a uh what could have been a
competitor to Twitter called Blue Sky
some kind of open I think it's some kind
of Open Source kind of thing but he's uh
he's left the uh Board of that company
and he's endorsing
xplatform and it calls the xplatform a
freedom technology I don't know if
that's endorsing it but kind of
endorsing it yeah
in other news apple and the electric car
truck company Riven R is that how you
say Riven or
Riven is it ryen like
driving I'm driving my ryen or is it
Riven so that you're driving your Riven
which
is I hate to hear that come out of my
mouth I'm driving my
Riven no but if I'm driving my
ryen well that's a good time we don't
know why apple and Ryan are talking but
as some people have noted you could
probably buy Ryan for $10 billion and uh
and Apple's doing a buyback of their own
stock for 110 billion so they've got 10
million laying around if they want to
buy themselves a fully made car
company you know I don't know if you've
spent any time up close with the
Riven but uh you know there's one in my
driveway almost every day
and uh belongs to hway and uh it's sort
of a cool looking vehicle it's got a
good look to it I can I can kind of
imagine that Apple you know being the
design company that likes good design
they might like it it does have a look
I'll say that design-wise it looks
pretty good I don't know anything about
the dependability or how much the
drivers like it or any of
that honestly at this point I don't know
how anybody can compete with Tesla
because Tesla has such a advanced um
bite on the
self-driving how many of you are having
the problem I'm having right now which
is I'm sort
of sort of in the market for a new
vehicle but I'm thinking when will be my
last um combustion engine because I
think that once I go electric which I
assume I'll go someday I don't think
ever go back so I'm actually thinking in
terms of should I get my last gas engine
and just sort of enjoy it for its you
know nostalgic feel you know get like a
Bronco or something or should I just go
to the Tesla Y and get the
self-driving so so I think the uh it's
kind of a tough choice because whichever
way you do you're going to regret it
right if I don't get the gas engine I'll
think ah I wish I had you know another
year with a gas engine and if I don't
get the electric I'm going to wish I had
the self-driving car but I'll tell you
what I wouldn't wouldn't buy right now
there's no scenario in which I would buy
a
Riven because if you're could to have an
electric you're going to want the Tesla
Network for charging I don't know if the
Riven is compatible with that yet or if
it will be or what
and secondly you got to have the
self-driving part the self-driving part
is going to be 50% of the value of the
damn car and if there's only one company
that can do it capably I think they're
going to own everything I mean if you
think about the fact I was just watching
a video of a Tesla's self-driving car
and it not only drove the entire way to
the destination but it it picked down a
parking space and parked in it it picked
out its own parking space and then just
park perfectly in it so I mean how are
you going to compete with
that yeah I mean Tesla's probably right
at the edge where they can make a case
to lower your uh Insurance costs by
50% do you think do you think that the
$100 you spend per month on the
self-driving software will pay for
itself and lower uh Insurance costs I
think it will eventually not yet
but yeah I think it'll be uh like free
money because it'll just lower your
insurance costs
eventually or maybe they'll just track
the percentage of time you're using
self-driving compared to regular driving
and give you some kind of discount you
know the more you do self-driving the
more of a discount you get at the end of
the month something like
that well Bill akman investor Bill akman
had an idea for retirement you said give
$7,000 per baby and then you just wait
um yeah it would have nearly
48,000 save for retirement when they
turn
25 but what's the difference when you
turn 25 here's what I worry about that
the inflation will eat up that $7,000 to
there's basically nothing
left I'm not sure that idea works
anymore I don't know if the math works
you know once you had the inflation rate
which is likely to go up I think it's
going to chew it into nothing I don't
even know if money will be worth
something when a kid born today retires
I what are the odds of that what are the
odds that a child born
today will ever spend something like
money like a a as a retired person not
as an adult but as an as a retired
person in 65 years you think somebody's
going to be using money I don't think so
I think money will not even be a thing
by the time they retire money not
sure well Boeing called off its planned
launch of the Starliner so they got this
rocket ship that was going to go today
but they called it off two hours before
liftoff I think the problem was that
they didn't have all the whistleblowers
on it
yet I'll just let that sink in a little
bit they had to delay it because they
couldn't get all of the whistleblowers
on
it okay yeah I'm just trying to start my
own uh conspiracy theories that's all
just trying to start
them well here's uh speaking of hoaxes
um Kathy hoko governor of New York is
getting some criticism because she said
the following thing she said uh she was
talking about getting more educational
opportunity to poor neighborhoods and
and especially she was calling out the
black neighborhoods in New York and she
said that young black kids in Bronx
don't know what the word computer even
means
they don't know what a computer
is wait
what the governor of New York thinks
that black kids don't know what a
computer
is what now of course uh the people on
the right pick that up as you racist how
racist could you be now is that
racist no it's not racist it's hyperbole
if Trump had said exactly these words
what would I say about it if Trump had
said exactly what she said I would say
he doesn't mean it
literally he doesn't literally mean they
don't know what the computer the word
computer means she simply saying they
don't have access to good technology
which is completely
true am I wrong to say that if Trump had
said this we would have supported him
and said he's just exaggerating you know
what he means
he means they need more computers yeah
so I'm going to give her a break on this
I think that's fake news it was you know
not the best choice of words but it's
pretty obvious she's using hyperbole she
doesn't actually believe that black
people don't know what computers are
even children she doesn't really believe
that I mean I'm not a mind reader but
I'm pretty sure she doesn't believe that
it would be
ridiculous um so here's my take on the
The Meta overall
strategy for uh the Democrats and see if
you can find this trend I I'll talk
about it as we go but it looks like they
try to hide their bad behavior in
complexity have you noticed that which
is something I don't see the Republicans
do as
much so let me I'll give you some
examples
um the election claims
so I'm going to tell you later about
some election claims you know claims
that there was some irregularity when
you read the election claims have you
noticed that's really
confusing because you got several States
you you got Arizona and something about
Pennsylvania and there's something about
Wisconsin but there's something about
Georgia so first of all you're confused
about what state and then there's a
whole bunch of
claims that are like oh the paper was
wrong the this custody the ballots there
was a locked door and is so detailed and
confusing there's somebody on Rumble
who's just yelling fart a 100 times in
the
comments I don't think I have a way to
block that so so enjoy yourself go nuts
I assume you're
drinking so that's the election claims
election claims are too complicated for
the U public to understand so you can't
get activated to do something about
something or vote differently when
you're overwhelmed with complexity a
confusopoly if you will now what about
the laware on
Trump if the only case were the Stormy
Daniels case we would probably get
engaged and we'd understand it and we
would understand that it's complete
bogus BS I'll talk about that more but
because there are 91 counts and there
are four of them and we're not all
lawyers and we're confused about which
story goes to which it's really hard to
know did Trump do something or not do
something uh I'm going to cover up the
comments from um everybody but
locals I've got a troll there that I
can't oh let me see if I can get rid of
let's see if this is fixable in my end
yeah no I don't have
so yeah so there's just one troll out
here was trying to ruin the experience
for everybody hey
troll we we've all seen it now 50 times
could you do something
else something
potentially unhealthy for yourself go
eat some
snacks yeah do something that's bad for
your health that's what we recommend all
right back to my point the Democrats
complex strategy how about the uh the
funding of the protests do you notice
that the prot protests are complicated
and then when you try to find out who's
funding them it's complicated because
there's groups but then there's a
group that funds the group and then
there's somebody behind that so they
make it as complicated as possible so
you can't quite
tell um yeah I got to cover that up
it's going make me too angry so I won't
be able to see the comments from anybody
except locals because there's somebody
in rubble who's just pissing me
off all right the uh but you can see
each other I just I'm just not going to
watch them so I'm only watching the uh
locals people their
comments all right
um what about the uh censorship octopus
that Mike Benz always talks about you
know the Big
Blob they like H literally hundreds of
these entities censoring people around
the world on behalf of the United States
it's too hard to understand we just
don't know how that all works it's a big
old octopus so you can't do much about
it what about Ukraine the whole Biden
Ukraine CIA weapons Labs Putin NATO it's
too
complicated it's too complicated you you
just can't figure it out so I think that
that's the uh the general reason that
Democrats are holding on to power is
that people can't understand what's
going on and I'll let me give you some
detail on each of those stories as we go
um meanwhile Matt Gates was trying to
get into prison to talk to Peter Navaro
who is as you know a political prisoner
of the uh of the nazil likee regime in
power
and and I think that's fair I I think
it's I think it's fair to kill the Biden
Administration a nazil likee regime if
they're if they have political prisoners
if if they're put trying to put people
in jail for their politics and they're
overtly racially
discriminating
overtly against white people I would say
that that would be uh that's pretty nail
likee in its own
way anyway so Matt Gates a member of
Congress was told by the director of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons that he
couldn't talk to Peter Navaro and the
reason was quote Peter Navaro is too
notorious to be interviewed by a member
of Congress too
notorious to be interviewed by a member
of Congress does any of that sound
legitimate to you no he's a political
prisoner and they don't want him talking
so you've got censorship on top of
 on on top of political prisoners
in our absolute criminal Nazi regime
that's in
power chrisy gome is uh having some
more some more fun she's trying to
explain why her book said that she met
Kim
Jong-un but uh when asked she will not
confirm it rather she's backing up to um
is even Jesse Waters asked her you
didn't you didn't have a conversation
with him at the DMZ did you talking
about Kim J
and gnome said uh I don't have
conversations about my conversations
with world leaders so her claim is well
I'm not going to say I didn't talk to
Kim Jong-un because I talked to a lot of
leaders and you know maybe maybe I did
talk to him maybe I didn't I'm not
saying but I took it out of the book I
took it out of the book because I don't
talk about the people I talk to who are
world leaders
let's just say that Megan Kelly is not
buying that
story maybe a lot of you are not buying
that
story
uh it's possible it's actually possible
that it's true I wouldn't say it's super
believable but is it possible that she
ever had a I don't know anything's
possible this seems
unlikely I think her political uh Future
Has uh been destroyed by that
book I hope she sells a lot of books
because it definitely ended her chances
of being
VP uh meanwhile Karin
jeanpierre uh got behind the podium
spokesperson for Biden and said that
violent crime is at a nearly 50-year
low violent crime is at a 50-year
low
really does that even sound like it's
possible
I don't even know like nothing is real
anymore literally everything is just
made up that I don't think the news even
tries anymore they're not they're not
even trying it's just what did this one
claim what did the other one claim
there's just no there's just no
attention to any kind of
reality meanwhile MSNBC has two new
polls that were just released showing
that President Biden is ahead of trump
uh by as much as Five
Points so do you believe that at the
same time there are polls that say that
that Trump is well ahead like well ahead
like 12 points that they're
coincidentally right on
time you got two new two new polls
that two new
polls all
right let me make sure participant
all right it looks like we've got
Carmen's in the waiting
room so that looks like that's working
so we should be able to have our
interview at uh 15 minutes before the
hour with author Carmen Simon who's got
a new book that you will be very
interested in all right uh so you got
these
polls does anybody think that these
polls are real or was it just necessary
for Biden to have some polls that look
good so they just told their Toadies go
give us some polls to make us look
good cuz it doesn't look real to me but
I also don't necessarily think the other
polls are real are is is polling even
real I mean I just don't even know at
this point how how can they be polling
the same thing and be off by 17
points can can it be true that the Trump
is up 12 but also down
five 17 point difference I mean I don't
think you can believe anything at this
point it's almost as if they're trying
to make polls look not
real it's almost like it's an attempt to
make you not believe any polls wh why
would they do
that why would somebody want you to not
believe the polls before an election
like
this it's probably exactly what you
think it is if they can make you not
trust any of the polls by giving you
wildly different poll results then when
Biden wins unexpectedly they'll say well
haven't we been telling you that the
polls are not
reliable they have they have to debunk
the polls before they steal the election
now I'm not saying that I know that
that's going to happen I'm saying that
we all expect it to happen and it would
look exactly like
this so the fun part about this election
season
is that we've learned all of their
patterns we know how they work so this
is exactly on time and exactly on
message oh guess what suddenly the polls
are super super undependable for the
first time in
history yeah it looks like the whole too
big to a rig you Trump says he needs to
have a victory that's too big to rig it
looks like they're going to make sure
that there's nothing too big to rig by
making sure that you don't know what it
was supposed to be if you don't know
what it was supposed to be you won't
know if it's not supposed to be the
answer that they give you at the end
so I would say this is highly
suspicious
highly well what else is suspicious
rasas uh reports on X is my main source
of uh let's say allegations about the
past election 2020 here here a few
things that Rasmus and reports likes to
remind us of on a regular
basis now these are claims I can't I
can't verify the truth of these they're
just claims in Arizona this is talking
about the 2020 election there was only
one official ballot paper so there's
only one paper that is approved to be
used in Maricopa County yet 10 types
were discovered by volunteers there were
10 types of paper only one is legal
how in the world do the people who print
the ballots not be aware of what the one
approved paper
is how is that and how can you tell it's
the wrong paper by looking at it how in
the world can the volunteers just hold
it in their hand and know it's the wrong
paper and know it's 10 one of 10
different so nothing about this makes
sense to me I don't know how you can
tell it's the wrong paper I mean is
could you tell 10 different flavors of
paper I mean the where the volunteer is
going yeah this is a brand new kind of
paper right here this one you know the
the first eight that I categorized as
totally different in
paper uh but we're not
done yeah yeah this one tastes a little
different I think this is a different
kind of paper so my first question would
be can volunteers really tell
counterfeit
ballots have have you met the public
have you met the public so if these so
my my other assumption is the only way
you could tell that the ballots were
non-conforming is if they're way off
they they must be so different somebody
says
watermarks I don't think it was
watermarks because they would have said
it was a watermark problem but they're
saying it's paper so the paper must have
been so off that you could tell by
holding it in your hand that's that's
pretty far
off that's well that would be the
allegation anyway and that uh the 10
types were discovered and amounted to
over 200,000 non-conforming votes that
shouldn't have been counted which is way
more than the margin of
victory for Biden meanwhile in Georgia
here just a few
things just a few things that we know
about the Georgia election 2020 we know
that a forensic audit was blocked we
know that 100 dropboxes lack
surveillance videos 20,000 ballet images
vanished 13 election routers vanished 10
Dominion tabulators vanished 140,000
ballots are still locked up and you
can't look at them and 148,000 mail
ballot signatures are
unverified that seems
suboptimal it seems suboptimal yeah
um all right fart boy is still there so
we'll just leave you leave you
blocked um
meanwhile there's uh the new Trump gag
order and uh Trump said this judge has
given me a gag order and said you'll go
to jail if you violate it and frankly
you know what our constitution is much
more important than jail it's not even
close so Trump is basically saying yeah
I'm I'm going to call you Bluff take me
to
jail now I I say this a lot but Trump
reads the room better than any
politician has ever read the room like
he can he can feel the Zeitgeist and
then just serve it and he is correctly
feeling that what his supporters want is
for him to push this as hard as he can
push
it it is what we want now that's
different from saying it's a good idea I
think I would stop short of saying it's
a good idea to go to jail but it's
definitely a good idea to push it if
you're trying to make your base happy
about it the thing we like about him is
he doesn't give
up it's sort of the thing that he's
accused of the most you know hey let
this election go you know you
lost but it's hard not to like somebody
who will never give
up that that's just an inherently
attractive quality in a human really you
just never give up and not only does he
never give up but he's on the verge of
winning the election at least if you
believe some set of polls so that's
always impressive when somebody pushes
that hard fights every fight pushes
every door open doesn't give up it's
just an equality it's just a a good
quality we like it we're drawn to it as
a leadership
quality meanwhile
um the the
uh I like I like that uh prosecutor
Matthew coangelo is just routinely
called corrupt corrupt
prosecutor I guess that would be an
opinion until it's proven um so they
bring in this uh
Trump employee who was the one who did
the accounting for the business records
the one who actually decided what
category things were and you know did
the actual work and said it was his job
to decide how things were categorized
and Trump never touched it and had
nothing to do with it the entire case
depends on Trump being aware and
consciously deciding to make a change
that the courts may decide was
illegal now the one most credible person
the person who knows the most the person
who personally made the changes says
Trump had nothing to do with it no
connection at all that's the entire
case so the case is over
but it just keeps
going like nobody told the prosecution
they should just go home if if the
person who decides what category it goes
in the expense says I did it myself
nobody else was involved and there's no
other witness there's literally just one
person who did the job and says I did it
alone that's the whole case is
completely gone do you know why you
don't understand why that case
it's like there's something about the
statute of limitations and there's
something about it's not illegal unless
there's a second thing that was the
crime and the first thing was trying to
cover up the crime but it's so
complicated because the crime that
you're covering up doesn't even have to
be something you've been convicted of it
could be an alleged crime that they
believes a crime and then the other
thing was to cover it up but only if the
only reason you were doing it was to
cover it up for political purposes and
if there was any other reason you were
doing it it was fine and it's all
complicated I don't understand
it so that's how they get away with it
if this situation were
simplified the public wouldn't put up
with this even Democrats wouldn't put up
with this if they could see it in its
simplest form the simplest form is we're
making up some
charges we're making up charges that's
the simplest form they're just making up
some and seeing if it'll stick and
it didn't it's not even close they're
they're not even in the zip code of a
conviction do you think Democrats know
that only the ones really watching the
rest just know that Trump has 91
indictments that's all they
know apparently stormmy is going to be
uh testifying today uh will she testify
that Trump gave her a gag
order yes no all right that's your dad
joke for the
dirty dad jokes all day
long um let's
see and then Byron York is talking about
this a rigged trial as many of us
believe it is
um let's see this so I guess Trump's
team wanted to bring in uh an ex head of
the Fe the Federal Election Commission
to say that what Trump did was totally
legal and uh apparently is's not being
allowed to
testify why would that be so so this so
the witness doesn't have direct evidence
about anything in the Trump case which
might be how the judge gets away with
this but he does have direct evidence as
being the head person who decides what
the law is in the federal election or he
was he would be the number one person to
say under these
situations this expense is totally
allowed
because whatever
so the guy who would say this isn't the
the person who would be the expert to
say whether something was or was not
illegal is not allowed to testify the
one person who would know more than
anybody else except maybe the K had of
that
job that it's illegal or not and they're
not going to let that person in now
that's a rigged trial that is a very
rigged trial now I had trouble
explaining it to you because I kind of
quickly looked at the story before came
on today but imagine if you
will did I lose
Carmen oh I
did all right well not sure if that'll
work or
not oh no I do have you I think I still
have her all right
um so the Harvard protesters were uh
awakened today
by um some patriots as they're called
blasting the national anthem so all the
people in their little tents got
awakened early in the morning I hope
they're morning people because they got
awakened really early in the morning to
go to their job of
protesting but uh here's the thing you
know we keep talking about who's buying
all these tents and why are all these
people get in the same matching tents
like who's behind it all and I have an
answer for you you think it's George
Soros who's funding it I know some of
you said that maybe
I think it might be the parents of these
protesters I think they all live at home
and their parents said hey have you have
you seen the news no what's in the news
I was playing games I didn't see oh
Terrible Things terrible things really
terrible man if I were younger I'd be
out there protesting I'd be on that
campus what are you talking about oh I
tell you in my day if this were me I'd
get myself a tent and I would go live on
the right in the middle of the campus
until they until Israel gives you
everything that they want or the college
does and the kids would say wow yeah
that's a good idea that I hate hearing
all this news about what Israel is doing
I think I'll get a tent I can't afford a
tent and then the parents say look I
care about this issue too I don't have
time to protest you have plenty of time
because you just live at home and don't
work but how about
just a spitball in here how about if I
were to buy you a
tent and then you could move out and you
could move into the quad in your tent
and move out of the house so I think
it's mostly parents who are trying to
get their kids out of the house by
telling them they should go protest they
buy them the tent no I'm making this all
up I think it's actually coming from
Soros and rockafeller and pritsker and
few other Rich Democrats the and by the
way we do have I think
confirmation that the the college
protests are the summer hoax you know
we're all waiting for the big summer
hoax who's going to hit the streets and
who Soros is going to fund to be a
pretend protest this is it and how much
do you love the fact that we all called
it ahead of
time literally for two years ahead of
time we're we all of us we're saying all
right what will the summer before the
election hoax be you know what what will
be in the streets that's completely
artificial well here it is it and you
can identify it by who funds it you can
identify it by the fact that the
news really ignored who was funding it
for a long
time uh but they're on it
now but if you're if you're a casual
news Watcher what do you know about the
funding of the
protests nothing nothing if you're not
really deep in the weeds of the news you
don't know that the Democrat the main
Democrat funders are funding this thing
for why well it might be so that they
can get enough action going that they
can cancel the election or do something
drastic but uh it's certainly the summer
hoax and it's another complex web of
things we don't
understand uh apparently Alvin Bragg's
lead prosecutor that Matthew Colangelo
Colangelo that I mentioned before he was
paid $122,000 by the Democrat National
Committee to be a political
consultant does that sound suspicious
because it sounds a lot like the
Democrats are paying him to go after
Trump that's what it looks like doesn't
mean it's true could be coincidentally
he's such a good political consultant
that for the first time ever they
decided to give him a bunch of money or
it's exactly what it looks like the
prose uors are funded and elected by
Soros and then the Democrats get to tell
them what to do and sometimes pay them
to do it so yes the justice system is
completely broken why does the average
person uh not complain because it's
complicated they don't really understand
it and they don't know anything about
this case and they don't know the DNC
may have paid somebody for some
political Consulting and they don't know
how it all fits together they don't see
the big picture it's all complicated
I saw a
uh um Elon mus said in a recent get
together public event he said that uh
you know America could end America could
end without free
speech um but here's what I think I like
Free Speech but I don't think America is
going to end if you don't have it
because I don't think we've ever had it
not really and I don't think the
country's ever been a Democratic
Republic since I've been live as far as
I can tell I'll probably tell you this
every day our government is just a
criminal Enterprise like all other
Democratic countries eventually become
the trouble with democracy is that as
long as people have freedom the rich
people will use their freedom to take
full control of the government which is
what
happened it's exactly what happened so
if you have a democracy SL Republic you
can pretty much you know Just Wind the
tape forward until the rich people have
all the control and here we are exactly
where you'd expect based on the design
of the system now if the design of the
system was such that rich people
couldn't donate and maybe just couldn't
do anything and you would watch them
very carefully to make sure they weren't
doing clever donations in indirect ways
maybe you can make a democracy work but
in the current design you guarantee that
the rich people take control
right away and probably always always
have been in control so the wars will be
driven by the people make money from
Wars and the you know climate change
will be driven by people who can sell
you solar panels and it's exactly what
it looks like a gigantic criminal
Enterprise but let me tell you where
they went too far it's one thing to be
called a tax cattle you know basically
we livestock that pay taxes to other
people so they can use our
money but uh where I think they went too
far is poisoning our food supply and
making us pay for it now that alone
would be enough reason to vote for RFK
Jr because he's very much on the
poisoned um food supply and he's not
letting go and I really really
appreciate his patriotism and service to
the country win or
lose it's awesome right so I think
they've gone too far with our criminal
Enterprise and like the mafia they need
to take care of their public a little
bit better right it's one thing to be
part of a criminal Enterprise but you
got to take care of the criminals right
we're we're all in this together it
doesn't work if you kill us all so
please don't kill us with your poison
food and poison
Pharma I don't think America is going to
end because I think we've always been a
criminal Enterprise in my lifetime and
it worked out fine so the the Dark Truth
is that a criminal government is
actually very effective Putin for
example total criminal government very
very
stable um Romney is admitting that the
reason Tik Tock is going to get banned
or there's so much effort to do it is
strictly well he didn't say strictly but
mostly because Tik Tock was so Pro
Palestinian
anti-israel now we knew that right
didn't we all
know that it was because of
Israel all right I was just checking the
comments to see if the troll is gone but
he's very dedicated so we'll cover him
back so I can see still see all the
locals comments but only from
locals
um all right so I guess it was exactly
what it looked
like all right I'll do a couple quick
stories and then we're going to do an
interview if I can connect with Carmen
Simon We we'll test the rumble Studio
technology here to add a guest anyway
maxen Waters says that there's a a bunch
of right-wing organizations are trading
up in the hill
somewhere now I got really worried about
those right-wing organizations that are
training up in the hills in case Trump
loses I guess they're going to do their
armed Revolution and I think that
they're probably white
supremacists and I I've decided to form
a posi to go hunt for the white
supremacists or as she calls them
right-wing organizations that are hiding
in the
mountains um and you can identify them
by their khaki pants so when you go
hunting for the the white supremacists
that are up in the mountains forming
their secret armies once you see a whole
bunch of guys and khakis and baseball
hats that's them that is
them and um I assume that most of them
were once in the US military but
probably left as soon as they found out
that the military was looking for all
the white supremacist because that's why
the military couldn't find any as soon
as they started looking all the white
supremacists quit the military
immediately to be not detected and they
went up into the mountains where only
Maxine Waters knows they live but I
believe everything she says so I'm
forming a posy to go get those damn guys
and we're going to have to stop this
ourselves who's with me
nobody all right maybe I'll do something
else RFK JR says that Bill Gates uses
philanthropy as a front to amass vast
personal
profits now you might know that I've
challenged many of you publicly many
times to explain to me how he's making
money from any of this well RFK Jr just
answered my question here's the question
quote talking about Gates he gets tax
deductions for giving money to the who
okay that's not making money that's just
giving your money away all right he
gains control of the
who
arguably but I thought the who was
controlled by China so I don't know is
it Bill Gates or is it China the who
finances the health ministries in
virtually every country in Africa so he
can say Gates can say as a condition of
getting that money this is the this is
what the who does
uh and you have to show that uh you have
to show that your people are vaccinated
and then the vaccines are something that
Gates owns a part of so he makes money
so let's see pulling all this together
because it's complicated isn't it all
the bad stuff hides in the
complication so there's a World Health
Organization that makes sure that uh
that funds certain countries for their
health care and if they don't vaccinate
they can't get the money
so Bill Gates gets control of the World
Health organ this is RFK Jr's take on it
and then he gets a tax break for that
but he still pays money I mean he still
ends up at a pocket money even though he
makes a tax break but that he can
influence them to buy his vaccines and
then he makes all his money
back well that's one way to look at
it but it's a little bit of a mind
reading problem isn't it so the mind
reading problem is you have to read his
intention if his intention is he's
trying to save these countries and give
them health care that they wouldn't have
otherwise then he's doing a real good
job of it now that would depend on the
vaccines being a good
idea and I'm pretty sure he thinks it's
a good idea um whether it is or not so I
don't think you can read his mind to
know that that's what's going on there
all right I'm going to bring on my guest
let's see if this technology
Works um let's see we'll be testing to
see if I can do that promote to
moderator
no um
participants let's
see you got your microphone
off
huh all right let's try something
else going into Duo mode
so the question will be whether I can
find the user interface to bring her up
to I can promote to moderator that's not
a choice hey there you
are all right turn on your microphone
your microphone's off
hello all right I can't hear you because
your microphone's off okay try again how
about now and how about this I've got
you muted let me unmute
you no that's not working I can't hear
you I can't hear you your
microphone how about now so apparently
you don't know what I'm saying and I'm
saying I can't hear you and I you I
appear to have on on my system it says
your microphone's off it says your
microphone's off
um you have no idea what I'm saying
right now do you I do oh you do yes all
right I can't hear you
Carmen because my computer is telling me
that your microphone is off it's on mute
okay can you see a microphone icon
toward the bottom of your screen or
something I I do but it so shows that
it's not muted can't all right so it's
not working hold on uh we're going to
try another minute here to get this
working I don't know if she's got a bad
microphone
or this is the first time we tried by
the way this is a beta test so the the
reason that this is not all worked out
in advance is that this is the working
it
out this is the trying to make it work
right here so you're all part of the
experiment we're using the rumble Studio
how about now all right no there's
nothing still nothing nothing so because
I tried so I'm using the the technology
of mine
okay I have one too so she has a
microphone but there's a button you
don't see a button to turn it
on so scroll scroll your page down to
see if there's a another choice that
comes up it might be at the bottom of
the
page oh let me try this hold on how
about this one oh there we go
yeah all right is that good so I can
hear you now but is are people going to
get a double I wonder if I need
headphones for this is there an
echo I'm not hearing an
echo um and how about the users on
locals do you hear Do you hear an
echo you hear
both yeah so it sounds like uh we are
being heard well look at that well let's
try to do this then all right no Echo
and we have audio all right how about
that all right so that was my user
interface problem I I think I was
blaming you for not finding the right
button uh on my uh my system it showed
mute but it actually was my computer I
had to uh turn up my sound so I think
everybody was hearing everybody was
hearing you except me right this this is
about the Neuroscience of attention and
now um it looks like we have quite a bit
of attention part part of your Technique
is putting a an error in it
all right let's talk about this you have
a new book I do it's called made you
look made you look just out now and you
can buy it and I'm going to give I'm
going to give the people a quick idea in
my own words that are all wrong before
you correct me okay okay so one of the
things you do if you can see in this
book see this person hooked up to all
these sensors and looking at a screen on
the computer that's what Carmen does
puts his little sensors on their body
and their head EEG ECG GSR facial coding
eye tracking and you have them look at
um mostly slides like business
presentation slides or is it other
things as
well it could be a presentation it could
be a website it could be a video
anything that in somebody's view should
capture attention which is what the
essence of the book is and the reason
you even need attention in the first
place is because quite often people
remember better if they pay attention
I'm saying quite often because it is
possible to remember something without
consciously paying attention to it but
we're all here in the business of
communication and usually you like to
get credit for things that you made
people look at so attention influences
memory and in turn memory influences
decision- making and the world moves
around and all the great things that
you've just talked about happen because
people remember and decide and attention
is at the root Foundation that so the
the thing that surprised me as I was I
was looking through your book is how
many categories of attention there are
in other words you can you know there's
a give us a few ideas like attention
isn't just simply looking at stuff right
give give us a little sense of how
complicated that is to determine
attention it is true there are um a
variety of ways in which the brain pays
attention we pay attention with our
brain and um in fact as I'm looking at
the comments I'd love to know what
typically attracts your attention
speaking to our audience and what would
you like more attention to and as you're
reflecting on those uh on those
questions just know that typically when
you pay attention to something uh you
pay attention in space and quite often
that attention can be very focused like
for instance when you have dinner with
somebody at a restaurant and uh you try
to be polite and you're only focusing in
on that one person I'm even seeing this
habit now where people are putting their
phones with the face down just to
indicate that now everything is in focus
and that focus is very sharp so that's
selective attention but at some point
from an evolutionary perspective we know
that it would not serve us well if we
were so laser focused we have to widen
our focus and we have to distribute our
attention so that you can see there are
some creepy crawlies hiding in the
bushes and your survival may be in
danger in of sorts so it is possible to
divide the tension but in that process
then you're missing some of the uh the
sharpness from the selective attention
but you have addition additional
advantages so those are attention in
space it's also possible to pay
attention across time and that's
sustained attention this is what people
associate with attention span and there
is a myth that um I'm sure that you've
heard debunked before there is no such
thing as a short attention span as a
scientist it bothers us greatly when
people say well are you noticing that
these days the attention span is getting
shorter and the answer is no it is it is
not getting shorter the brain hasn't
changed much no it hasn't changed much
in the past 35,000 years we're capable
of paying attention in fact to test this
we can ask our audience members here
what um what's the longest amount of
times you have bench watched on a TV
show and I guarantee that if they're
genuine with us their answers are not
going to be in the seconds their answers
are not going to be in the minutes their
answers are going to be in the hours
so is is the whole thing that as long as
we're interested we have infinite
attention we can we can stay definitely
focused and uh as long as the stimulus
is interesting and or important because
sometimes you have to pay attention
because something is critical not
because it's the most interesting thing
you've ever seen all right all right
let's uh let's give the audience some
like takeaways so they can get like some
of the the functional useful like how's
it going to make your life better so
based on your uh your data and now you
have a pretty big database of human
beings looking at visual things and
having certain physical biological
reactions yes all right so so in
theory you could give us some ideas of
like what things you found out work
better than other things for attention
is it can you can you break it down into
some tips yeah definitely let's um let's
consider some tips and in the book we go
beyond the um multitude of attention
types and we look at the intersection of
two ways in which we pay attention by
asking the questions where is the brain
looking and you can look externally or
you can look internally and who's doing
the looking because sometimes you decide
to look on your own but sometimes
somebody makes you look as per the uh
the title of the book so let's consider
some techniques on when you force
somebody to look let's just say that you
want your children to pay attention to
you you want your
customers to pay attention to you you
want your boss to pay attention to you
so you're forcing the looking and you
want them to look
externally and of course you can
manipulate physical properties of a
stimulus like for instance if you make
something louder of course you'll pay
attention if something was silent before
that or if you make something brighter
or bigger if something was not so bright
or not so big before so as long as
there's a contrast here's a hard number
that I like to use the brain will pay
attention to physical property of a
stimulus if there's enough contrast
between two items and that contrast has
to be in the 30 to 40% range in other
words for instance um a company that may
not be differentiated enough is because
the product that it offers compared to
the competition is not that much
different the brain cannot perceive the
contrast so as you're reflecting on your
own message ask this question sometimes
not the easy it's not easy to answer am
I different by at least 30% from
somebody else so contrast could be a
good technique in terms of forcing
somebody to look externally you don't
always have to look make them look
externally you can also make them think
I really like communication that guides
you internally and you reflect for a for
a moment so for instance I was seeing
this um this ad for um an Alzheimer's
organization and they were showing the
person that critically needs care but
the focus was not on that person it was
on the person that gives the care
because sometimes we forget that those
people are being taken care by somebody
else and he just gives you that small
moment of of of thinking and the joy of
getting it so as you reflect on your own
communication are you giving others the
joy of getting it the joy of getting it
so so you can get attention by tweaking
their
emotions or by tweaking their uh their
contrast which is more of an
intellectual thing so so there's ways to
get at them intellectually by contrast
but also biologically by what excites
them and yes and uh also you can think
of it in terms of being a bit more
provocative I mean even hearing the
conversation that you had with the
audience uh before you and I started
talking there are a lot of provocative
things that are being said like for
instance if you were to insist on the
phrase um poison Pharma that's not a
combination of words that you typically
hear mixed together and unfortunately
what happens especially if you operate
in the business space people are often
way too cautious and they Bab other
people's brains and they don't want to
um challenge the status quo they don't
want to impose any tension and just like
with that contrast in some perceptive
power like for instance something is
bigger by 30% than something else you
can have a contrast in Emotion in other
words not all emotions are going to get
attention and be memorable you really
have to have a much stronger stimulus
and I'm noticing these days as I've been
doing a lot of these Neuroscience
studies you showed the the cap earlier
that it does take a stronger and more
intense stimulus for the brain to focus
and stay with you for a while now have
you picked up any uh changes in what it
takes to get somebody's attention and
now you said that we have good attention
spans if we're interested enough but
does the average person look at let's
say a PowerPoint slide
deck uh do they have the same brain that
we did 10 years
ago I'm noticing that the threshold for
stimulation has changed
so even though the brain itself is still
the same organ the way that we build our
habits is to now crave more and more
stimulation so we will stay with you for
a while if you give us something like
even our attempt to fix the microphone
for instance is just creates this POS of
stimulation so people very quickly can
reach for their phone we're only a click
away from being turned off and if you're
not the source of strong stimulation
then the brain is very Adept and has a
lot of choic these days so so so here's
the funny thing uh for those of you who
are watching the audience when you saw
me you know struggling to get the
technology working and it looked like it
wasn't going to work and maybe I'd have
to bail out and everything what what I
was thinking during that period was not
oh no everything's going wrong what I
was thinking is there's no way you're
going to turn this
off I was I was think you you're you're
going to have to wait at least to see if
I can make this work because you know
you wanted to see me fail like you know
in public because I I always say that
danger is the thing that keeps people
interested so you have to have some like
there somebody's going to go off the
rails you know somebody's going to say
something that gets them canceled or
something so when you were do you and I
were trying to make this work the whole
time I was thinking oh this is kind of
perfect like like I I wasn't having a
care in the world because it was either
going to work or not work but one way or
the other was going to get a lot of
attention and so I was just sort of
conscious of that that it was working
even though it was a disaster like the
disaster worked just the way I wanted it
to work and turning what you're just
said to a practical guideline for
everyone consider this a method of
priming so one of the reasons why people
don't pay attention is because they're
not ready to pay attention and we
observe this in business all the time
let's just say that you have a sales
presentation that has 20 slides and what
something very critical for your product
appears on let's say slide 18 by slide
18 you may have done something that
would have diverted your audience's
attention away so right before that
slide you need a primer you need
something something that says to the
brain now something important or
interesting or ideally both is about to
happen and let me ask what do you want
to Prime right before the the thing
you're priming for or can you prime like
like 10 minutes before I love that I
love that question and the answer
depends on what we were just talking
about in terms of the intensity of the
stimulus
because if I use that phrase that you're
using in terms of poison Pharma that is
a loaded phrase that will last a while
in terms of of intensity if it's
something that's a weaker stimulus like
for instance you may just use a
gratuitous photo of somebody naked that
may just last there for a few fractions
of a second and then it's just it's just
gone so if you have something intense
you can rely on that primer and what do
I mean by priming is inviting the brain
to react to something based on what it
just experienced and you can have a
perceptual primer you can have a
semantic one like we were doing with the
phrases that were you're using that
affective one or the emotional one
switch give us some examples because the
audience needs examples well so for
instance let's just um think of a a
semantic one as one that uh that gives
you the joy of of getting it so I was
just looking at um an ad not U not too
long ago and you just mentioned the the
phrase dad joke this this ad was created
by durix you know the uh the condom
company and it only had words on it I
love ads that only have words because
they really have to make you think and
um the word said I don't need a condom
and the conclusion was our favorite dad
joke and this comes from from the from
the dur company I don't need a I don't
need a condom favorite dad joke okay it
took me a while to get it all right got
it but it does so it takes just a moment
and then you think about it our favorite
dad joke and gives you that small aha
moment and by the way with the uh with
the EEG signal we can calculate the
Eureka Effect so we know where to look
in the brain and what brain waves to
analyze in order to see if the brain has
just experienced that aha moment yes but
but uh bring bring it back to the
priming on the durx example I I get that
that's memorable but is that priming
what's the priming part that would be
the priming if it let's just say I was
in a business presentation and I wanted
to get the brain ready so because that
was just such an in congruous moment so
something that maybe people did not
expect now I'm ready for what happens
next I'm willing to sacrifice one
stimulus in favor for what happens
immediately after and that's an example
of a semantic one because you have to
think about the meaning and also an
affective one because it's a bit more
intense than your typical business
stimulus so is priming in this sense
it's more than just giving you let's say
a foreshadowing of the specific content
but rather it's just going to is it just
rebooting your brain so you're open to
any anything exactly so you're in a
ready State the reason we pay such
little attention quite often in business
context and we forget most of the things
that we're exposed to forget our lives
almost as quickly as we live them is
because we are not in a state that is
ready to receive it would it be fair to
say that people sort of get an inertia
of thinking in other words they're
thinking and their logical drive this
train right down the tracks and you gota
you gotta derail the train before you
can get to the think that anything
besides the train going down the tracks
is going to happen exactly yes so in
terms of practical guidelines if you
think about this notion of habituation
which is what you just said if you're
showing people let's just say that
you're in a business context and slide
one will have some text and charts and
slide two will have more text and charts
and slid three will have more text and
charts after a while your brain starts
learning learning to predict what
happens next what's the likelihood that
the next slide is also going to have and
charts okay but if you jolt the brain
out of its habituation with one of these
primers we're talking about so whether
it's something perceptual or whether
it's so now you don't have a chart in
text you just have an intense photo for
example and then you go back to your
typical stimulus the brain has to be
jolted somewhat in order to remind it
that you cannot predict the next moment
nice so
unpredictability so in I'm trying to uh
relate this to my hypnosis background so
there there's something about making
people uh uncertain and confused which
makes them uh ready for any certainty
that you as a leader or a hypnotist give
them so you want you want them to make
them think they don't know what's going
to happen or they're not in control and
then you give them the answer because
everybody wants
certainty so so if they think they have
certainty they don't need any but if you
scramble them they're going to be
looking for certainty and then you you
give it to him just in time is it is it
similar to that that's the Hypno take
definitely Sim similar and I like how
you're associating with this and of
course the moment that you give the
brain a modum of uncertainty you can
guarantee some attention because we
cannot afford to not know what happens
next if you think about the brain the
most important thing is what happens
next and the reason we enjoy that which
is familiar and that which is
predictable is because we can better say
this is what will happen next the moment
that you introduce that element of
surprise and surprise by the way is
always biologically B bad for the brain
because what is surprise but a failure
to predict then of course we're
attentive because the difference between
what the brain expected and what happens
in real life is how the brain learns I
think this is a very important practical
guideline for all of us to reflect on
because as you think about the content
that you create or the way that you want
to grab other people's attention often
wonder how do I create those moments
where people think something is going to
happen and in fact something else does
surprise yes and Surpise is different
from novelty by the way because
sometimes people treat those elements
interchangeably but novelty is something
that you haven't seen or experienced
before surprise is something that you
have experienced before but did not
expect like for have an eggshell and
suddenly it opens and a baby elephant
comes out of it you have seen the
eggshell you have seen the baby elephant
but perhaps not combined together
now another thing I saw in the book that
interests me in particular because it's
based on something I used to do when I
gave presentations in my corporate days
before I give a presentation on the
boringest subject in the world which was
like the budget like just impossible to
keep people awake during that I I would
hand out Tic Tacs you know the the
little lozen thing the Tic Tac and
everybody will take a Tic Tac so that's
the first thing I learned you say pass
these around everybody takes one like
nobody says no to a Tic Tac that's the
weird thing but but it also gets them
physically
moving and and to keep somebody awake if
they're chewing they'll stay awake
people don't fall asleep while their
their mouth is moving and and so I found
that you could actually keep people a
little bit more awake by making them
move while you were talking to them and
the movement is just eating on the Tic
Tac so there you said your yours was a
deeper complex thing but you had said
something about getting people moving as
part of the
process I like that reminder one of the
hottest Trends in Neuroscience right now
is this notion of embodied cognition
because as scientists we recognizing
more and more that the way we come to
know things and perceive things and talk
about politics or talk about the
boardroom and the bedroom is not by
simply looking around us and building
some mental representations that are
abstract what we know and what we
perceive and what we remember and what
we decide on comes at the intersection
of the brain and body interacting with
the environment therefore embodied
cognition so whether you give people the
Tic Tac to chew or what would would
recommending business is inviting people
to like physically take notes I'm hoping
that this conversation is useful to you
and maybe you have jotted a few things
down the more you physically write not
electronically write the stronger the
attention and the memory for those
segments if you have customers invite
them to an experience Center if um your
products afford you to do that but yes
getting the brain and body in motion
will definitely contribute to your
attention and memorability Factor now
here here's a practical tip based on
that when I would study back in my you
know school days I I would try to take
the same information in as many ways as
possible so I'd read it but I'd also
rewrite it sometimes I'd draw a picture
because that the the process of turning
the idea into a picture really
solidifies it because you remember the
picture and then you'll work backwards
to what it was but I would also
sometimes sing it or hum it that be like
you know 2 + 2 equals 3 and i' be
drawing it and stuff so I would try to
get as many physical
bodily connections to the the stuff and
it really made a difference I think so
it's it's a smart technique I wish more
people use it for themselves um if
you're here in a session like this
because you want to coach others perhaps
even your children teach them how to
keep the body in motion we are at a
strange point in our society because
we're used to having so many things come
to us like the food comes to you you no
longer have to do that your friends come
to you you can meet them online but the
moment that you put the body in motion
the brain is putting motion as well and
the opposite is true as well you keep
your body still then your cognition
slows down
also that makes sense so um you know the
the uh the amount of information in this
book is kind of uh it's amazing so I'm
going have to spend a lot more time
looking at it but there were the in the
end there's like a whole
checklist of things that you could have
done in your presentation to have made
it better and I I won't read them all
but you you've done something that as
far as I know has never been done which
is you've captured the biological
markers for attention and it seems to me
that there's some AI companies that's
going to give you a billion dollars for
that because nobody else has it right if
if you could teach your AI to make you a
powerpoint slide or a video and then one
of the databases they had access to was
how does this affect people biologically
where where do I put the image how often
do I mix it up when do I surprise them
when do I give them novelty that's all
that's all something an AI could do if
it had the data couldn't it if they had
the data and um you're absolutely right
it's we're sitting in a good position to
have some biological markers for
attention for working memory for
motivation to keep watching because it's
one thing to watch something and pay
attention for two minutes it's another
we know it's possible but it's another
to pay attention for 30 minutes for
hours on end so you have to be motivated
enough and have the um biological
endurance to do that we're looking at
how much the brain enjoys the experience
and how alert and awake it is and we do
that by going Beyond self- reports
because you could ask your audience What
attracted your attention what kept you
going what did you like what did you not
like and people will tell you but quite
often those self-reports are unreliable
so as AI models get trained are they
getting trained on survey data that
quite often relies or on memory that is
is avable so it's good to use these
kinds of signals and also debunk some
myths like for instance it surprised me
that complexity is actually more of an
attention grabber than Simplicity
is well that that's a double-edged
sword I don't know if you heard my
earlier presentation but you can also
hide all your in
complexity so so it's a place to it's a
place to diversify somebody's attention
until they can't find the needle in the
hay stack but but I could also see how
complexity would attract you because you
want to you want to unravel it it's like
oh what does this mean I'm going to
spend a little time unraveling this I
can see work both ways so true and and I
really like your Viewpoint and I think
especially from a scientific perspective
it's good to define the terms because
there's complexity there's complication
and there's chaos and often I think in
the latter two you could probably hide a
few more things but complexity as long
as you present to the brain some items
that are not only large in volume but
also diverse and
interconnected and you add some meaning
to this complexity that keeps the brain
going and you manage that complexity
well then the brain synchronizes a lot
better with a complex stimulus then with
a simple and quite often simplistic
one so if we turn this into a practical
guideline I would say complexify in a
manageable way versus simplify your
communication got it so uh give us give
us let's say what what would you
say if you were going to give somebody
say the best like operational
tip like what what's the one thing out
of everything you learn from from the
studies the sensors you put on people
and your data if you're going to make a
PowerPoint or a video or something
what's the one thing you're going to
make sure you absolutely do well here's
something that you can reflect on as um
we reach the end of the conversation and
um it will uh it'll make you think it
will not necessarily be easy to uh
implement but it'll be very helpful I
found through all this research that one
concept that comes up again and again is
this notion of fractals are you familiar
with fractals if you insist on some
elements that maintain their properties
at any level of magnification like if
you look at a tree the shape of the tree
is represented in any kind of tree
branch it has the same shape as the
bigger tree and if you look at a smaller
Branch yet it still maintains the same
properties as let called it the father
tree or if you go to the grocery store
look at a head of broccoli you will see
that the broccoli itself has some
properties and then as you zoom in every
s single little head of broccoli has
some uh some same Properties or
cauliflower so it's cauliflower all the
way down and as you reflect on your
communication and the way that you want
to attract attention and remain
memorable pick a theme something that
repeats at any level of magn
magnification and the moment that you
have that set of properties and you keep
going again and again and again
repetition by the way is a sort of
priming then as long as you make it that
it's cauliflower all the way down it
doesn't matter if you're speaking to
your audiences for two minutes for two
weeks for two years if you come back to
the same theme and you make friends with
fractals you will be able to uh to keep
people's attention for a long time I
think politicians do this very well so
so fractals is a a tough word to wrap my
head around but let me let me ask you if
I if I did it right so today when I did
my live stream before we talked um I
said I had a theme that is that the
Democrats were hiding things in
complexity and then I gave five
different stories where there were some
complexity and maybe some bad stuff was
hidden in there is that a fractal that
is definitely a fractal because if you
were to then expand on those themes we
could be here for another five minutes
we could be here for another five hours
and it would be the same set of
properties the same set of swirly
equations so for instance so yes pick
your theme and some supporting points
and as long as you're very consistent
with those and you believe in them and
they have great impact on society too
that's always very very helpful then you
can keep the brain going for a while
because you're giving it The Best of
Both Worlds you're giving it some
familiarity because it's the same
repetition at any level of magnification
but with each elaboration you can add
some of those elements of surprises you
can complexify and you can keep the
grain the brain motivated to stay with
you for a while I'll tell you my biggest
pet peeve is when somebody wants to
explain something to me and they're
waiting to give me the answer at the end
and my brain can't handle that so it' be
like you know Jose my my my uh Builder
handyman here he'll say uh can you have
a minute you'll say you know over by the
eses there's this this this board that
covers the thing and then there's the
corner and I'm like where's this going
where is it going and and the answer is
you know there's there's a
leak and I can fix the leak so what I
want to hear is I can fix the leak and
then after I hear that every detail he
gives after that is now Salient I was
like oh okay so I'm understanding
because the boards come together that's
why there's the leak but if you start
with okay the boards come together I'm
like I I have no structure I have
nothing to pin it to so is that close to
what you're talking about I really like
what you're saying in terms of
elaboration because that's what builds
up the the complexity and especially in
business in our personal relationships
as well you have to earn the right for
that
elaboration and in your relationship
with with the with the plumber that may
be a little bit different because if
your plumber had been Elon Musk and he
started with the details at first and
something that maybe initially didn't
make sense because your relationship is
probably different he has earned the
right to elaborate first and then give
you the no I'd be like Elon no get to
the point get to the
point but I think what's important for
people to recognize is that sometimes we
are let's say in a business context and
they may have heard the guideline well
tell us story because a story is just so
attention grabbing and memorable and
that's not the case you have to earn the
the right for those details you have to
learn the right for the for the story
sometimes you do have to start with a
conclusion depending on your on your
Rapport so if you start with a
conclusion you you you need to back it
up but it should also be should it be
like a surprising
conclusion in other words should have
some novelty as well such as uh I'm
going to show you over the next 40
minutes that everything you knew was
wrong would that that be a good one
yes so you can uh you can start with
something that um challenges the status
quo challenges a personal Norm
challenges uh the way that uh that
you're thinking in some way not that
many business people know how to do this
by the way they want to start by not dis
discarding accuracy they want to be
precise and and correct you're talking
about those budget meetings you don't
want to disregard accuracy in a in a in
a budget meeting but why not you know in
the book by the way you'll learn about
this this notion of exaggeration and um
disgard discarding accuracy whenever
whenever you can in a way that's Mindful
and playful so as you think about your
hooks for instance sure some unusual
stats could do the trick but um what
about an unusual photo or something that
you did not you see you did not predict
like we were talking
earlier so um I I'll just tell the
viewers that several years ago you
helped me build a presentation a slide
deck that went with my public speeches I
was giving corporate speeches and I had
an experience with that that was so
uniform I I'd give my talk and usually
it was a group of people who were there
because they wanted to hear me so you
know there were a friendly crowd
everything would go great and then
afterwards maybe I'd sign some books or
say hi to people and people would come
up to me and I swear to God every group
said the same thing who made your slide
deck like who who did that because
because it was so so different than
anything that I'd ever done or even seen
really so I I can confirm that the the
science that you were putting into it
even a few years ago before you even did
this book was already completely
lighting brains on fire like like people
were just like like what did I just see
and they would talk about it and they
would come they would act that that
that's the ultimate test getting
somebody to act but and they all acted
the same way where where did you do this
how did you do that and you know I would
tell them that you help me Etc so uh I
recommend this
book made you
look Carman Simon PhD and uh thank you
so much for joining us Carmen um and
making us smarter and uh anybody who
reads this book is going to do a lot
better in your presentations and getting
people's attention and basically your
life in general so even if you're not in
this kind of business you might be
interested for the uh the academic
intellectual why does something work and
something doesn't it's really it's
really a fascinating drive inside the
brain it feels like taking a trip inside
a brain that's what it feels like thank
you so much for for all the kind words
and thank you for all the attention that
we got here in the uh in the chat box
and um keep in mind that if you do
attract attention you can stay on
people's minds and when you do you will
live longer all right great thanks for
joining and I'll talk to you later and
everybody thanks for joining and I'll
see you tomorrow same time same place
bye for now
