good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time today I'm going to attempt to get
through the entire show with no cursing
whatsoever I know maybe I didn't do so
well yesterday if you know what I mean
but today no cursing
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to that level of
godliness there's nothing else you could
call it all you need for that is a
coverer mug glass a tanker chel s a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee enjoy me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here
the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
siping happens now go
well ladies and
gentlemen if you were a subscriber to
the Dilbert reborn comic on the
xplatform or you were a member of the
locals Community Scott adam. locals you
would know that Tina the tech writer is
being replaced by AI but in the ultimate
insult the ultimate employee
insult Tina will be asked to train her
AI replacement
yeah it's probably one of the number one
suggestions I get from people when they
when I ask for Dilbert ideas you know
hey is anything bothering you at your
workplace the the one I get more than
any other one well actually the one I
get the
most is people uh leaving smelly things
in microwaves but I can't write comics
about smells it just kind of doesn't
work
and and they talk about Ste in food from
the refrigerator because those are like
the simplest dumbest comic ideas but the
other one is people being fired or
replaced and being asked to train their
replacement now imagine if you had to
train AI as your replacement is that
better or is that worse I don't know
we'll explore that in the dber comic
well I got to tell you about something
that happened to me in the simulation
yesterday for about
I don't know several years
now probably at least once a day I've
said to myself you know what I should
sit down and I should dedicate a whole
bunch of my time to writing up what the
uh the drinking bleach hoax was how it
was executed and really do a good job on
it so yesterday um I fell asleep working
during the afternoon which is not
uncommon I woke up next to my laptop as
I often do in my man cave
and uh I really don't sleep enough I
think that's probably the bottom line
there and I felt all inspired suddenly
and I said darn it I'm going to write
this up and so I I I put three hours of
the most inspired best writing of my
life and I wrote up the whole bleach
drinking hoax and if I'm being honest
about my own work it's just some of the
best work I've ever done my
life and after years of thinking about
it every day and thinking I've got to do
this for the world and it could change
it could change the really the course of
history and when I was done I looked at
it and I said
damn this thing is going to be super
viral like everybody's going to read
this it's going to uncover the entire
technique of creating hoaxes tell people
how they fell for it show them very
clearly that it was a hoax and it was
going to be one of the three 10 pole
hoaxes and when I was done and I hit uh
publish there was a technical bug that
ate it and it's gone
forever
so sometimes the simulation has its own
plan
apparently do you get a preview no it's
gone forever it's literally gone just a
technical problem and
I don't know if I can do it
again so here will be the interesting
part I tend to think that things like
this have some kind of a weird purpose
to them because I can't think of the
last time I lost a
document do you remember the last time
you lost a document after you'd finished
it it's almost something that doesn't
happen in the modern you know
technological World very rare but it's
definitely gone and I thought to myself
there must be some reason I'm not
allowed to do
this now I you know obviously I don't
see any specific mechanism to to make
that happen but it's really a weird
coincidence that the most important
thing I've written in years by far you
know the the most consequential thing
that would actually had put a big you
know dent in the whole
world
disappeared I just don't know how to
explain that it's just such a weird
coincidence so here's what here's what
we'll watch
for does it mean that I was meant to
rewrite
it
better what do you
think is The Universe telling me it
wasn't good enough and I have to do it
better because it's that important or is
The Universe telling me don't do
it or is it nothing but a coincidence I
don't know I don't think the human brain
knows how to sort out this stuff but
I'll let you know if I write
it
anyway I do I did have an earlier draft
of it so I might be able to put it back
together uh Thomas Massie tells us that
the house Sergeant at Arms wants to find
him $500 maybe a day per day for having
a post on X that shows a video of the
house and all the and a number of the
members waving Ukrainian Flags during
the vote about the Ukrainian
funding now do you think that the uh
house Sergeant at Arms has the authority
to find him because of something he
posted on
X well apparently that there's some kind
of rule that says you can't have a video
of you know the proceedings
inside and if it was his own video and
he took it and then he posted it that
probably would be a violation
on the other hand it does seem like
absolutely legitimate
news and I would be very happy to see it
so of course I reposted it to make sure
that more people saw it and I'd like to
make an offer to Thomas Massie that uh
if it turns out that he's going to pay
$500 a day I will I will pay for one of
those days so I'll pledge $500 if it
gets
fined I I'll pay $500 to you know either
to his camp campaign or something so I
I'll try to make sure that he's uh the
blow is softened right and if anybody
else wants to commit to paying for a day
um you can pay for your free speech
because Free Speech costs uh let's see
free speech costs $500 a day for free
speech
yeah well California my state has so
much solar power it turns out that uh
during the
day um there's more solar power than
there is demand for it now we still have
overall there's an energy problem
because it's not balanced but so many
people in California took the government
government rebates and everything and
put solar on their house that when we
get that afternoon baking sun we're
actually creating more energy than we're
using that's kind of amazing isn't it I
mean it's bad and good at the same time
so 25% of our electricity is now from
solar you know this is one of those
things that kind of it's too slow and
then it happens fast you know there are
a lot of things like that it's like God
it's slow it's slow it's
slow um and then it's fast so maybe
we'll have a lot of solar here really
fast did you hear Biden's latest Gaff if
it's a gaff at
all he was saying in his speech about
Trump but he talked about himself
accidentally he said how many times does
he have to prove weak can't be
trusted how many times does Trump have
to have to prove that Biden's
Administration can't be trusted well I
don't know how many times will it take
he still has half of the country on his
side so apparently it's not
enough well I don't know if we should
make anything of that other than Biden's
brain is toast and everybody knows
it Constantine kissen who you know from
trigonometry um very fun and smart
commentator on world events has
introduced a new word into our
vocabulary the retardo
sphere the retarda sphere all right I'm
just going to read you what he said
because it's kind of funny the way he
puts
it so Constantine kissen says the onx
the leftwing sphere was created
by sensible people on the left being
silent when they should have said
something the right-wing spere
is being formed in exactly the same way
and he says stop sending me DMS about
how much you agree with me about the
woke right strap on a pair and say
something so that that's a little bit
different than the point he's going to
make next unless you want to be on the
side that thinks evolution is quote just
a theory I.E doesn't understand what a
theory is in science sees America as the
bad guy in every war and wants to stop
women voting so that that would be his
description of the right-wing retardo
spere would be people who think
evolution is just a theory uh meaning in
in their uh view of it is not real and
sees America as a bad guy in every war
and wants to stop women from
voting and then Constantine says I am I
am not right-wing but the last thing I
want is for the left and right to go
full at the same time and then he
says truth is King in all caps
well may I uh take a moment to defend
the retardo
spere would you like that are there any
members of the sphere here who
who would uh is there anybody here who
would identify with not fully accepting
Evolution seeing America as the bad guy
in at least the recent Wars and thinks
that women should stop
voting is anybody in that category here
any one of
those all right A lot of people are
saying yes all right here's my take on
it and I think Constantine is is pretty
far off on his frame for
this uh I like his General
thinking you know his General thinking
is I don't want to be associated with
crazy
people that's good or irrational people
so I like the basic thrust of it but
here's what I think he might be missing
because as he says he's not rightwing so
there's some things that if you spend
more time in that sphere you get a
little Nuance on these things so I'm
going to give a little Nuance that may
may not be obvious to the Casual
traveler okay number one the part about
Evolution being just a theory yes it is
embarrassing when somebody says they
don't believe in evolution because it's
quote just a theory if I can educate you
on one thing it's that people who
understand science will think you're a
 if you say something's not proven
because it's just a theory because in
the scientific realm Theory means it is
proven hypothesis means it's not proven
Theory means there's so much evidence
for it you might as well just call it a
fact but because science doesn't like to
commit itself knowing that sometimes
even a fact or something they thought
was absolutely true can sometimes be
overturned
so they do keep it a little bit weak
just because you never know what a fact
is for
sure um but it is not true that theory
means they're not quite sure about it
they're very very sure about it and
that's what the word theory means in
their domain so get that part right just
know that in common language Theory
means unproven but in scientific
language it means very very much proven
does everybody know that
now again it doesn't mean they're right
I'm just telling you what the words mean
in their domains you know we'll talk
about who's right separately okay so get
that right because you will sound like a
bad debater if you get that that word
usage wrong that's a real red flag for
somebody who's who's going to mock you
for not understanding science however it
is a very common um it's a common
misunderstanding and I think I I don't
think that anybody disbelieves the
theory of evolution because the word
theory is used would you agree with that
there's nobody who disbelieves it simply
because they use the word theory so for
Constantine to point that out as
something he wants to
mock I don't really think that's
something anybody actually believes I
think they disbelieve Evolution for a
reason that I'll talk about could be a
right reason could be a bad reason I'm
not saying it's a good or bad reason but
I'm saying it has nothing to do with the
word so if you think that anybody has
this belief because they didn't know how
to use this word correctly in the domain
of science that's a complete
misdirection it's just really they're
using the word wrong has nothing to do
with their actual opinion of the the
topic it's just the word so I would say
that that's not a fair statement but I
think the larger point if I could read
between the lines I'm not a mind reader
but I think what he means is more the
general idea that Revolution is proven
according to
science and that if you say you're not
buying it you're being sort of
anti-science in a way that so
that seems to be Constantine's point but
I would like to offer the
following
counterpoints number one when tuer
Carlson who really got this whole
conversation going when tuer Carlson
says doesn't believe in evolution
Because he believes that God made us do
you think that Tucker regards that as a
scientific fact that God made
us I think what maybe Constantine is
missing is that this is what i' call a
lifestyle
belief a lifestyle belief it's not in
the domain of what's true or false it's
a choice based on
faith the the reason there's a word
faith is because it's very distinct from
I looked at the facts and Science guided
me so to me when I see Tucker say that
uh he has a belief that God made it to
me that's a lifestyle choice to have
that
worldview I don't think that's the same
as not thinking evolution is real to me
those are different concepts so I think
you have to understand that some people
make a choice to accept an entire let's
say philosophy because following the
philosophy has worldly benefits meaning
it helps you today and maybe helps you
go to heaven if you think that's part of
the
plan so when I look at Christians let's
say the the Tucker types who believe
that God created the earth I say to
myself well I don't know if you've got
the mechanism right but I'm not so I'm
not so I don't lack so much humility
that I think I know the answer so I
think there's a little lack of humility
when you say I know the answer of how we
all got here and you got it wrong so
that bothers me a little
bit but I think you have to understand
that religious faith is not trying to
compete with science it's more like if I
buy this entire package I can see that
it works While I'm Alive it might even
work after I'm dead if I go to heaven so
it's really just a a choice about what
works and I don't think you should fact
check
it I'm not going to fact check the
Muslims right I mean I used to think
that was something I could do it's like
huh I'm not so sure that Muhammad went
to heaven on a flying
horse don't bother it's not a scientific
discussion it is a lifestyle choice to
accept a worldview which has a certain
set of advantages right here on
Earth so um I feel that that has to be
said then there's a question uh is
America the bad guy in every war well I
think the word every is you know a
little bit hyperbole but I do believe
the that America is the bad guy in
recent Wars is
that is there anything wrong with that
opinion it does seem to me that our
recent Wars are driven by
energy and the military industrial
complex and stuff like that you know the
Atlantic Council whatever I don't think
we have any kind of a democracy where
we're going to save the save the world
for Freedom we don't care about anybody
else's
Freedom we could give a oh I almost did
it I'm not going to curse we don't care
about the freedom in other countries we
will work with their dictator just fine
yeah do you think we have a problem with
the uh the kingship of uh the royal
family in Jordan no no the royal family
in Jordan are awesome
and we seem to like him and get along
just fine no we don't need them to be a
democracy as long as are on our team
well that's fine so no I do think that
America is the bad guy but I'll give a
little bit of nuance on that as
well I'm not sure being the bad guy is
the worst thing it could
be it could be that being a good guy is
the worst thing you can do CU being a
good guy makes you weak and probably get
destroyed by somebody who's more of a
bad guy I I feel like in the real world
when you get outside of the you know the
philos
philosophical that the the baddest
player tends to be in charge and you're
probably better off being on the same
team roughly speaking as the baddest
player in the game so I think America is
usually the baddest of the bad but being
on the team of the bad guys when they're
winning it might be your best bet for
survival so I think you can be on the
bad team and also say it's good for
you so I think I think that's fair to
say but no America is not always the
good guy and everything we say about why
we do what we do is all
Bs would you agree the reasons we give
like oh we're going to save your
democracy oh we got to make sure those
dominoes don't fall all the Communists
are going to come and get you none of
that's real that's completely made up
it's always about money and energy and
Military and you know and all that but
as I say again keeping our economy
Strong by raping other countries seems
to be a good business model and it does
keep us safer so it's a complicated
world and how about this one uh uh the
and the sphere uh wants to stop
women from
voting how serious do you think that is
now I see that a lot it's like a a
common thing but has a lot to do with
the Democrats you know being largely a
party of women and a lot of the Bas
crazy things are seem to be driven by
women but I don't think anybody's
serious about
that I mean not when I say not anybody
there are a few people who act like
they're serious about it I don't think
so yeah I I don't think they're super
serious about it so I think Constantine
may you know as he says he's not
rightwing
so he may see these things as a little
more serious than they are little more
serious but more to the
point if when you say truth is King in
all capitals there's sort of a
suggestion there that you know what the
truth is and the other people got it
wrong how's that sit with
you let let me let's talk about
evolutionary biology that uh science got
right now if got it
right wouldn't that be really unique in
science to be right we know that 50% of
the studies can't be
reproduced um I'm pretty sure that
climate change is completely BS if you
look at the
models I'm pretty sure that the field of
psychology is probably more BS than
that I'm pretty sure the string theory
is not going to pan
out I don't think physicists can really
explain any of the things that they're
talking about but the math works you
know and sometimes the experiment will
will prove they were right but I don't
think they know what's going on I don't
I don't think they can explain the
double slit experiment without using
words that just sound
crazy so you know uh chemistry is
probably pretty solid because you can
you know run the experiment and see if
it works and Engineering is solid so
we're real good at well not we but
people some people were're not
are good at making rockets that can
maybe go tomorrow someday but that's
engineering right
science is as close to completely broken
as anything has ever been so it feels
almost an outof dat opinion to say that
truth is King and believe the science we
just came out of a pandemic believing
the science sounds like the dumb view at
this point and so I'd like to suggest
that the people are saying that they
know which science is correct because
science is good and they've got all
these facts I'd like to suggest that I'm
not sure that's the smartest take in
2024 in 2024 I think everything that
can't be proven in an experiment on a
table like
chemistry is probably
BS it's there's a far greater chance is
not true now I got dragged into this
Evolution thing because I said the
following I said that uh
the survival of the fitness or I'm sorry
survival what do they call it natural
selection I said in a post that natural
selection was no longer believed by most
uh
scientists now of course the people who
believe that they knew scientists jumped
all over me and said what are you
talking about natural selection is
believed by almost all
scientists to which I said I probably
should have said uh survival the fittest
because if you're not aware of this one
of the most famous evolutionary
biologist types Stephen J
Gould um he was famous for having shown
that survival of the fittest in its most
narrow sense wasn't a good explanation
of what was happening in other words it
wasn't just that you competed better so
you survived but there were a whole
bunch of things that could cause you to
survive that were not directly related
to how fit you were as a
competitor sometimes it was just
luck sometimes you just happened to be
where there weren't any competitors so
you weren't like especially fit to
compete you just didn't need to compete
now other people say Scott Scott Scott
you using compete to
narrowly if if there's a limit to
resources you're at the very least
competing for the limited resources and
if the resources are not limited at the
moment if your population keeps growing
eventually you hit a limit and then you
will be competing for
resources but there are these other
these other elements like luck that
could be part of it as
well now here's what I
say and see if this blows your brain
up what does natural selection mean if
it means all of those things that are
part of the natural
process so what's it
mean it doesn't mean anything
so the me the mechanism to describe
evolution is that hey it looks like
things
changed these things are part of nature
so it's natural
selection so nature selected what the
outcome was how could that not be the
case what would be the alternative to
Nature causing it to be the way it
is and to me that's such a broad
explanation that it doesn't mean
anything uh all it is is an observation
that here we
are do do you get
that natural natural selection doesn't
mean anything because it means
everything if it applies to everything
in nature had to happen just the way it
did to get us to just where we
are it's not really talking about
anything
and and so here I note that the change
was from you know this narrow definition
of fitness to some wider definition of
you know VAR number of variables
involved in my opinion that's a complete
change in going from a specific
mechanism to just saying I don't know
just look
nature now I know what you're going to
say when what the scientists will say
Scott Scott
Scott I feel so bad for you when you
talk about science because you don't
know what's going on and you just don't
understand all the sciencey things
but I do have a long track record of
calling BS on fields in which I don't
know anything about them and my track
record is really good like really really
good at calling
BS this to me looks kind of like BS now
I'm not doubting that things change over
time unless we're as simulation but I do
think that if you talk about uh people
being dumb for in uh Evolution you kind
of have to mention that the simulation
is about a billion times more likely
than Evolution and if the simulation is
true then evolution is just another
illusion within the simulation so it's
not true it's just an illusion and
probably that the history gets created
on demand as opposed to the other way
around anyway so Constantine who's uh
one of the uh more
valuable I think public figures and
thinkers um everybody has a blind spot
and I think if you're not in an in group
you almost always have a blind spot for
you know the Nuance of the
reasoning so there I'm discovered I'm a
defending the sphere
um all right so the Gateway pundit
giving us more details on this judge
Cannon and the unredacted documents from
Jack Smith in his investigation into the
moral Lago um
boxes so apparently according to the
Gateway pundit some of the things that
were redacted but now we can
see uh is that uh revealed that Biden's
White House had Direct ties to the maral
Lago raid the Biden regime was also
directly tied to Jack Smith's
investigation despite claims to the
contrary from meric Garland the uh uh
Mir Garland
and and uh the redactions also covered
up that uh the National Archives had had
several conversations with the Biden
white
house so the whole question was Trump
keeps saying that Biden is you know the
Biden Administration is orchestrating
all the lawfare and everybody oh no what
are you talking about I've seen no
evidence of that whatsoever yes you've
seen no evidence of it because it was
redacted and now we've seen it
apparently there's lots of evidence that
the uh that the Biden White House is
directly connected to all these lawfare
situations so it's exactly what it looks
like it's a lawfare it's completely
illegal immoral
illegitimate and probably there's
nothing will happen about it because the
people in charge are the bad guys and if
the bad guys are also the ones in charge
nothing's going to happen nothing's
going to happen about that probably one
of the biggest uh Crimes of the century
is the lawfare against Trump uh and the
January 6 committee probably the biggest
uh Rico conspiracy that I've ever seen
will be not I don't think it'll be
punished at all not at
all all
right
um all right here's a persuasion
expert Jonah berer and he was on some
Show recently uh teaching people this
following persuasion
trick and he he used the example of a
five-year-olds you were trying to give
five-year-olds to help clean up clean up
the house or clean up their space or
something and the technique um using a
Stanford University study well this it
was a Stanford University study about
5-year-olds if you say to them uh can
you help help
clean you'll get a lower um cooperation
than if you word it this way instead of
can you help clean you say can you be a
helper and clean up if you say can you
be a helper you're giving somebody the
option of accepting an identity when
people accept an identity then they act
on the identity it's automatic if you if
you ask them to do something they
compare it to their identity and if it's
not in their identity they don't do
it so this is a technique which I've
also talked about but I call it the uh
the Jesus
persuasion Jesus persuasion is telling
you that you could be a better
person so it's encouraging you to adopt
an
identity as a more moral and virtuous
person than you were before you heard
the you know before you heard your lord
talk to you so it's very appealing to
say to somebody hey how would you like
to upgrade your identity from you know
peasant who has nothing going for you to
believer who has a higher moral standard
and is going to happen and you think I
wouldn't mind being one of those and
then once you become one all of the all
the activities that go with it just come
automatically all right now do you
understand why I uh register as a
different party from what I usually
Advocate does that make sense now does
do you understand why I'm not a joiner I
don't join groups because as soon as you
join a group and identify in a real way
you know I I register as a Democrat but
I don't mean it so it's not my
identity so I try to avoid having an
identity because the moment you have an
identity it causes all actions to
conform and that's what team play does
so if you say to somebody you're a
Democrat they're going to start acting
like one even if they were not inclined
to before identity creates
activity so you gota you got to change
somebody's identity if you want them to
change their behavior almost nothing
else works because people don't act
against their identity like if you think
you're an honest person you don't rob a
bank right it it it's pretty much a
direct a direct effect if you think
you're an academic you're probably more
likely to go to school right what
whatever you think you are you're likely
to do that thing so this is a really
really good
persuasion uh
technique now let's apply
it let's say you're a Republican and you
want Republicans to vote do you say make
sure you
vote no no no cuz make sure you
vote is telling you what to do it's not
no identity now compare that to
this be one of the people who saves
America help us save America
vote oh now you get a little identity do
you want to be a savior do you want to
do you want to be like the Boston Tea
Party do you want to be a patriot you
know P Patriots a word that not
everybody's comfortable with but it's an
identity now the identity that I uh have
most accepted in the past is
Patriot because I think wow you know I I
just want to be on the side of the
people who are on the side of the
country but lately when given that half
of the country canceled me I I was asked
recently um somebody was giving me a
hard time um on some point and they said
but oh because I said something about
Israel and they said but you wouldn't
say you're uh that you don't support
America just because America does some
bad things with you to which I said huh
America canel
me half of it so no I don't support
America America canceled me the current
system which I call America ganged up on
me identified me discriminated against
me and has been discriminating against
me in employment for over 30 years I've
lost four different careers for being a
white guy so why would I support that I
do not support America that's my current
brand new opinion and I think I was you
know largely hypnotized that I ever did
here's what I
support you I support you citizens who
did not cancel me
period because you're actually good
people and I like good people and I like
most of the things that you like and I
identify with you I'm definitely one of
you and I'm completely on your team but
America was lost decades ago so to say
that I support America would say that
I'm in some kind of a
brainwashed you know gooner situation in
which I'm like Oh waave my flag nope
unfortunately I've been far too
blackpilled to say I support the
brainwashing collection of things which
our masters have given to us I support
the citizens and there are a number of
things I support like freedom of speech
for example and second amendment for
example so I definitely support those
things and there's a whole bunch of
stuff in the Constitution that I think
is terrific so I'm I'm Pro
Constitution but do I support the
government no the government is my enemy
and I mean that literally the government
is my enemy I mean the government has
decided I'm their enemy and has
weaponized its own resources against me
personally personally yeah I've
experienced it in a personal way so no
I'm not going to be on the side of my
enemy because my enemy is literally
trying to destroy me my government is
trying to put me out of business and
they tried really hard they just
couldn't try harder than they did
without you know an overreach
so they did it the clever way they can
through their you know
minions so now don't ask me to salute
the flag or even stand for it I I don't
I don't believe I would even stand for
this the Pledge of Allegiance at this
point because I think it's absurd I I
think the country is so far from any
image of America that was the kind that
you hold in your mind as the good one
the one you wanted to support we're so
far from that I mean the Biden
Administration is just a criminal
Enterprise the CIA has been running the
show since probably the 50s or 60s we're
nothing like a Democratic Republic
nothing like that and we are being
robbed every day so that richer people
can sell weapons to people basically so
no I don't support any of
that all right fake protest season is
coming as you all know we all expect the
big summer of fake
protests and what we don't know yet is
if the prop palis inan protesters who
some would call
pramas um we don't know if that's going
to be the summer protest or if there
might be some new one but I suspect it
will but there is a
wrinkle don't you expect that the summer
protests are always going to be sort of
pro-democrat anti-republican
that's the ones you expect right because
you think oh George Soros is funding
people he's sort of closer to the
Democrats so it's going to be sort of a
Democrat friendly protesting summer Riot
group like BML or you know in its own
way
antifa so does that apply to these
groups well I looked a little bit did
some Googling and apparently some of the
organizers of these recent protests are
funded by the Soros
organization so apparently Soros is
funding things now you'd normally think
this would work out well for Democrats
relative to Republicans but it turns out
that the protester surrounded Senate
leader Chuck Schumer's home in
Brooklyn and he's
Jewish imagine being Senator
Schumer a Jewish American and you look
out the window and a whole bunch of
people with Hamas colors and Palestinian
flags and stuff are demonstrating
against you and and uh it's not too far
not too long after October
7th how do you think how do you think
Chuck Schumer feels about that now let
me tell you I'm not politically I don't
often well a few times I have I don't
often agree with Chuck Schumer so
politically I'm not in his side
but I don't want to see anybody in my
country surrounded suspiciously because
they're
Jewish I don't think it's just because
he's the speaker of the house that feel
it feels like they're getting a twofer
there and I'm not really comfortable
with that so I wonder will the Democrats
and Soros and the people who generally
are favorable to that point of view are
they going to say we went too far and we
unleashed a force that's going to eat Us
Alive because this force is going to eat
alive the
Democrats somehow for some reason
Republicans are getting pass I guess
because ranana
power at least in the
presidency so Trump is getting a hell of
a free pass I don't know how long that's
going to last I think it has everything
to do with him being out of
power so let's uh let's keep an eye on
this uh they're asking Schumer to stop
arming
Israel and uh earlier in the day Schumer
asked thanked speaker Mike Johnson for
passing the Ukraine Israel funding Bill
all right so here's my question Mike
Johnson is not Jewish as far as I
know um Schumer is they were both
involved in passing the legislation but
the Jewish guy is
surrounded is that a
coincidence it does feel like they're
going for the
twofer doesn't it so it's a it's hard to
be comfortable with that as just free
speech I mean I guess it is Free Speech
but it's hard to feel that it's you know
purely a policy thing and not something
much much
worse
anyway so we'll keep an eye on that I
don't know if that'll become the summer
riots um but I suspect it will I just
think it might backfire it might be the
summer riots that they wish they hadn't
instigated and I remind you that there's
no such thing as spontaneous organic
protests that's really not a thing the
only way these protests happen is if
organizations that are already
founded and they've got some members and
they get funding from somebody like
Soros or some other source and then
they've got money to do something and
they've got
members and then they got something to
do but it's not like there's people just
were sitting around watching the news
and then they thought oh I think I'll go
out and protest in the streets and get
arrested now it's mostly organized
stuff um persitz had a uh opinion piece
in I think it was the Wall Street
Journal and uh he was talking about
Biden's recent Gaff where he sort of
both-sided the Israel Palestinian Hamas
situation and in so doing he he became
sort of an example of the fine people
hoax himself in other words it looked
like he was creating some kind of a
moral equivalency between Israel and the
terrorists who attacked Israel now you
could argue whether that's a correct
take or not but here's what I'd like to
say uh dtz did debunk the fine people
hoax um but he did it in such a poor way
that I have to criticize him I don't
know if I've ever criticized dtz before
in terms of his opinions because I often
call him out as one of the best you know
uh intellectuals in public and willing
to say the difficult things even if it
doesn't agree with his team so generally
I see him as you know at the highest
level of intellectual
credibility and so so I very much
appreciate that he here's what he said
I'll give you his quote so you're not
you're not listening to me say he said
quote you had some very U oh he's
talking about Trump's quote on
Charlottesville so he's quoting Trump
you had some very bad people in that
group but you also had some people that
were very fine people on both sides Mr
Trump said now this is according to dtz
he later explained meaning Trump that he
meant both sides of the debate over
whether to remove a Confederate monument
and that the anti-semitic chanters were
very bad people he had in mind he should
have been clearer from the start that's
where he lost me he should have been
clearer from the start no alen dtz
you're letting your team get a your team
of the Democrats you're letting them get
away with this too
easily this was not a case of a hoax was
created by Trump not being clear at the
very same time that he said the fine
people thing he said a few things and
then within I think 60 seconds he said
and I'm not talking about the
neo-nazis they should be condemned
totally now that is the clearest
statement anybody ever made about
anything and for El dtz to say he should
have been clearer from the start is G a
total pass to the bad guys on his team
on his team the bad guys who turned it
into propaganda he should have said this
was never a thing he was very clear that
he wasn't talking about him and the bad
guys his team turned it into a hoax that
changed the nature of America and has
almost destroyed it now that's a fair
assessment
anyway um and then he went on to say
Biden had this week his own moment of
unclarity well I think it is fair to say
that Biden was
unclear which also is not a full
condemnation of what he said because I I
think that there's a little bit of
piling on because of the piling on at
Charlesville but uh I think Biden was
unclear but Trump was not unclear and I
don't think you should draw an
equivalent between them alen dtz who I
have much respect for intellectually I
think you just got this completely
wrong uh there's uh saw a post and some
data from was it n Wess I think the
account and Wess um that the number of
here's a demographic breakdown of men
and women uh Democrat versus
Republican so uh the Democrats in
married men they have 39 % are married
are married men so less than half are
married men married women 42% so less
than half or fewer than half which is
correct fewer than half or less than
half is there any pedantic
people is it less than half or fewer
than
half or both it might be one of those
cases where both works because sometimes
only one is the proper way but we don't
often call that out anyway so whichever
it is then unmarried men 45% again less
than half so the only demographic that
Democrats have the majority in of the
married and unmarried men and women
stuff is
68% of the single women are Democrats
68% of single women are Democrats now
without being unkind and referring to
Scientific data single women and liberal
single women in particular are known to
be especially batshit crazy meaning
literally they seek the therapy the most
they're literally the most
miserable
uh um
depressed mentally ill group and I don't
know how much longer we can go without
calling it out for what it is because
we're pretending we have a political
difference it's not a political
difference when one of you has a mental
illness and I think I've called it down
enough that you can see it when you see
the the women the Democrat women on TV
not all of them there are plenty of them
that don't fall into this category but
don't you notice that they look mentally
ill can't you tell just by looking at
them and again I'm not saying all
Democrats or anything like that but
there's a ton of women who are Democrats
who when they talk you look at their
eyes and their expression and all you
see is mental illness and to continue
ignoring the
obvious that we have a mental illness
problem that is pretending to be a
political
philosophy um I think is not helping us
at all so we should call it out for what
it is you know uh Constantine calls it
uh um what do you call it the uh
 sphere but I think that's
giving it too much credit if you call it
the sphere you're you're sort
of acting like you were born that way
but I think that TDS has literally made
people
crazy which means it's not necessarily
their own fault so I have some sympathy
for the mentally ill Democrats because I
do think that they were propagandized so
hard by their own team that Trump is
Hiller that the idea that there's you
know something like an equal number of
Americans who want Hitler according to
their view of the world that's got to be
the most distressing depressing saddest
alarming thing I could ever imagine put
yourself in their
position you're you're a single woman
and you've been told and you believed it
that an actual Hitler was coming into
office to take away your democracy and I
don't know turn you into baby makers or
something yeah that would be of course
that would make you mentally ill why
wouldn't it so I'm not sure there's
anybody to blame except the the
propaganda people on the Democrat side
have destroyed the mental health of
their own team the Republicans were able
to withstand the propaganda do you know
why can you tell me why the
propaganda that the Democrats completely
mentally Disturbed their own people why
did it have little to no effect on
Republicans tell me you know the answer
why did it have little or no effect on
Republicans no not because Republicans
have more men although they do it's not
that critical thinking
no they get both sides
no news better news no they knew was
fake no guns no BS detector no media
okay
I must be the worst teacher in the
history of teachers I literally just
gave you an entire lesson on why this is
happening Republicans have an
identity so their identity is completely
uh protective against Democrat
propaganda Democrat propaganda doesn't
work with somebody who identifies as not
a Democrat if you if you identify as
Republican their propaganda just bounces
off you you don't need better news and
better sources you don't need to see
both sides you don't need better
critical thinking but I think it's
humorous that you gave yourself all
those paths on the back all right I if
you could take a moment just take a
moment to think about the the comments
you were watching the comments at the
same time you were all patting yourself
on the back for your advantages well
it's probably because we have better
critical
thinking yeah
it's that's probably because we see the
news on both sides maybe it's because
we're not mentally ill maybe it's
because men are smarter than women and
women are emotional and they're more men
and Republicans did you see how you just
you just immediately ran to compliment
yourselves and do you know what you
complimented yourselves
on fill in the blanks what did you
compliment yourself
on your
identity yeah
you basically gave me answers that went
to your identity so your identity is you
see both sides you're logical you're not
you're not driven by emotional Spirits
you know you see things as they real
that's your identity that's not
thinking that's not reasoning that's not
facts and data that was your
identity this might be the best lesson
I've ever given because I didn't realize
that you would all fall into this trap I
didn't plan it this way but but is
anybody having a moment you're seeing
this right you're seeing it in real time
that the persuasion the persuasion rule
that identity is everything and do
something differently never works for
anybody you you just watched you you
solidify around your identity with no
regard to the facts with no regard to
the facts but you just complemented
yourself at how awesome you are in your
identity now uh if that sounded like a
criticism it shouldn't be you should
take it as a like a mind openening
moment because as I've told you before
um even though identify you know often
as far left of some of your opinions I
prefer you as
humans so my audience are the people I
would want to be around if I were ever
in
trouble I would want you guys to show up
first
you know what I mean you know if my car
is on
fire and I'm trapped in it I want all of
you to be the first ones on the scene
you get that right because you're the
ones who would pull me out at Great
personal risk that's who I want on my
team I don't need to agree with you on
your religious beliefs nope I just need
to know that if I'm in a burning car
you're the car that's going to stop
and for that same reason I will stop for
you so that's important so I'm very
bonded in terms of you know that that
Dynamic but I I try not to give myself
an identity beyond the fact that there's
some
character there's some character things
and some policy things that we're
totally in agreement
on all right um the anti-trump legal
commentators according to the Daily
Caller there's a group of the worst
people in the world according to me who
have a weekly Zoom meeting to talk about
how they can you know present the case
against Trump in the most persuasive way
so here's the here are the people who
are meeting on Zoom weekly to you know
make sure they're all on the same page
about going after Trump so you've got uh
let's see Norman Eisen he's a CNN legal
analyst you've got Bill Crystal MSNBC
legal analyst Andrew Weissman lawyer
Jeffrey
tubin Jeffrey tubin on the zoom
call it's a zoom call Jeffrey tubin on
it you're probably
wondering are you just going to let that
go Scott that there's a zoom
call with a bunch of lawyers who are
anti-trump and one of them's Jeffrey
tubin
am I just going to let that
go also has Lawrence tribe former Nixon
White House counsel uh um although he's
you know super Democrat at the moment um
John Dean he's a Lincoln project
co-founder George
Conway we all know George Conway and
Harry
Litman and then for some reason
Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer
Rubin is in these
meetings
so it seems to me that another way to
report this story would be that there's
a group of people who meet weekly on
Zoom to masturbate over Trump's legal
issues I think it's being led by tubin
and uh if they're not jerk buddies I
don't know who is so I'm going to refer
to them anytime I see any of these
lawyers as the jerk buddies they're just
getting on zoom and gooning over oh I
think he's going down now oh
oh tell me more about what Jack Smith
said oh redact me baby redact
it that's how I see it redact me
hard um is that
true somebody just said they're all
Jewish is that
true George
Conway John Dean
no I don't think I don't think they're
all
Jewish but the fact that there were a
lot of lawyers who are also Jewish is
not not the biggest surprise in the
world no I don't think they're all
Jewish
um so the Tik
Tock so they're calling it a ban but
it's not uh so the Tik Tock Bill
apparently get is going to make it to
the president's desk and he's going to
sign it now I think this is a total fake
I don't think Tik tok's going to
disappear one of two things is going to
happen they've got a year to fight it in
court and they'll either win in court
and it will stay just the way it is
or um it will be divested to an American
company purely for the purpose of our
own CIA having a back door to it so that
instead of China having all our private
information and being able to control us
and brainwash us our own country will be
able to have all of our personal
information and usage and who we're
connected to and also uh
brainwashes I'm not entirely sure that's
an
upgrade now I I of course have been one
of the most uh um vocal proponents of
banning Tik Tok but only if you're
really going to ban it if all you're
doing is putting the CIA in charge of it
it's just you're just changing the
warden
you didn't let anybody out of
jail I want I want people to get out of
jail I'm not looking
for a different
reward that that's buying me nothing so
I think that the the public has been
duped into thinking something has
happened and and your Congress is
finally acting and you know there's
things and processes and I don't think
anything is happening it's either going
to go right back to the way it was
because of some you know court case or
it's going to be worse because our CIA
will be in charge of
it I don't
know doesn't look good to me
um and the thing that the thing that
makes me most suspicious is that it went
from having no support to suddenly
everybody loved
it and it got you know put into a bill
that you couldn't resist or at least
Congress couldn't resist
that to me that just looks like our
intelligence people decided it was time
to make a play and they just made a play
to own the
thing and remember where Constantine
said hey I don't think you can say
America is the bad guy in every
war I think the I think America just
stole one of China's biggest
companies or at least the American
Business part of it I don't know you
know I don't think China should have
been in control obviously but I don't
think we're the good
guys all right um according to the
Gateway pundit the headlines are sort of
missing this story that stormmy Daniels
owes Trump 300,000 plus interest for her
false claims she made against him so
storby Daniels is actually paying Trump
for false claims made against them the
courts have ruled at the same time
Trump's in court for
uh what an accounting thing that nobody
can even understand why it's
illegal literally the experts are I
don't even know why this is illegal I I
don't even understand
it so of course
that's
anyway
um Elon Musk was commenting on a graph
that I think uh was going around that
showed that U around 205
is I wonder what was happening about
then the words racism and racist and
race were used in
newspapers uh up 361 to
700% starting around 2014 is
actually
so as Elon mus says this graph
illustrates the woke mind virus taking
over Legacy
Media uh same happened with online media
and the education system than is spread
to other
countries and here's what I say I don't
think there's any
force that will make wokeness go away
and I I think our uh our impression that
it's being beaten back is because if you
read a lot of right leaning Republican
kind of news sources they're always you
know trumpeting the anecdotal story of
this University or this Texas place got
rid of uh Dei and stuff like that
but I think it's growing faster than
it's being reduced that's my sense of it
we just see the stories where it's being
reduced we don't see all the times that
somebody added their di you know added
the DI
staff so I don't think it's correcting
itself at
all um but there is a force that could
correct it and it might be forming up it
hasn't kicked off yet so there was a
court case recently I think it was the
Supreme Court that said that
uh white people could sue for
discrimination in employment now we
haven't seen a big wave of that but
given that uh Steven Miller has that
America First fund which seems to be
designed exactly for this sort of thing
which is to push individual cases that
have a you know larger political
Dimension to them and what I'd love to
see is the funding for that backing a
bunch of uh anti-white discrimination
cases
because if it becomes impossible to be
in business and discriminate against
white people because it's just too
expensive the trial lawyers and the
insurance companies just eat you up that
could change things I don't think
anything changes until it's
expensive so here where I might disagree
with Elon Musk that uh that people will
just sort of see the I'm not sure what
mechanism he thinks would reverse it so
I won't I won't read his mind but the
only mechanism that reverses anything is
money nothing else really makes a
difference it's just money and even when
it looks like is not money it's money
right because if somebody's let's say
defending the
reputation right that's kind of money
really so as soon as it gets too
expensive to discriminate against white
people which has never been the case
it's always been easy and it would be
easier to discriminate against white
people than it would be to explain why
you don't have enough
diversity so as soon as it becomes more
expensive to screw white people there'll
be less of it but we're not there
yet all right um I I said again
provocatively and I'm going to tell you
this story only because the persuasion
element of it because you you've heard
it before uh as you know the
ADL came after me and the head of the
ADL accused me of being a Holocaust
denier in public now I don't have to
defend myself from that because you
should be wise enough to know that's not
a
thing I'm obviously not a holocaust Den
now they said that in public about me
now the ADL is going after a number of
other people in similarly specious ways
and what I've said is that I don't
support Israel uh because the ADL is my
enemy and then I also say because I know
how people respond that I say yes I know
they don't report to Israel yes I know
the ADL does not report to
Israel but that's not my
problem now how many of you think that
what I say doesn't make sense in the
comments does it not make sense when I
say I don't support Israel because the
ADL who is not who is not funded by
Israel that came after me soes that
makes
sense now remember I said that um Israel
doesn't own the ADL they don't control
them but that's not my
problem yeah no my problem is that uh a
substantial entity that has offices in
Israel and they say that their uh
mission is this is from the adl's own
words the ADL Works to support a secure
Jewish and Democratic state of Israel
living in peace and
security and for decades they've worked
to secure Israel and Democratic State
promote a strong and constructive us
Israel relationship so to me that's the
ADL working for
Israel now if you say but Israel doesn't
control them then I say let me introduce
you to the real world may I if Israel
kicked their ass out of Israel and said
you're embarrassing us so badly that you
can't have an office Israel you're just
making us look like
idiots do you think the ADL could
survive that if Israel said hey just for
the record we want to say this once the
ADL does not represent us they see
they're a disreputable organization and
we disavow them do you think the ADL
could survive that well the management
couldn't the ADL probably could but the
management couldn't they'd have to
change management so when I say I don't
support the nation of Israel because the
ADL went after me does that sound
crazy it's not my
problem that they don't directly pay the
ADL it's true but that's not my problem
here's the thing if somebody on your
team who is so on your team that they've
got an office in your country and their
entire mission one of the the Topline
mission statements is to make sure that
that other country is doing
fine they're working for the same team
and if somebody on your team is trying
to destroy me which they are the ADL
tried very hard then no I do not back
Israel and don't ask me to all right so
I don't care if Israel fixes it but just
don't ask me to help now you might say
to yourself um Scott how much were you
backing Israel before which is a good
question do you think that there's
anything I do or have done that has any
impact on Israel in any meaningful way
in the
comments give me your give me your
opinion do you think that it means
anything or is it just you know talking
on Twitter or
X well here's what I
think it would depend if you thought I
had some uh influence on the region or
if you thought I was authoring the
simulation it might matter um but at the
moment I think that the ADL is
destroying the reputation of Israel and
uh that's not my fault all right as long
as the ADL and Israel are joined at the
hip um I don't support the nation of
Israel now I'm not I'm not supporting
their destruction and I'm not supporting
the the enemies of
Israel and I'm not you know I wasn't
donating before but I definitely don't
think the United States should give them
any
money now one of the arguments I heard
is that uh David boxing hor makes this
argument that if uh we didn't fund
Israel with the requirement that they
buy our weapons then Israel would create
its own weapons manufacturing because of
course they would need weapons and then
we wouldn't have as much influence over
them because they would be independently
making their own weapons instead of
relying on
us to which I say there's a pretty big
advantage on relying on us for weapons
the biggest one is it it's not easy to
bomb our one
Factory if Israel had some weapons
making
factories there would probably be two or
three that if you took them man of
operation they would be completely out
of weapons but the United States
probably is harder to get to meaning
that if the weapons are here and we ship
them to Israel it's probably a safer
weapons you know situation so it's a
complicated situation but I don't I
don't favor uh any American money going
to Israel as long as they have a better
debt situation than we do as long as the
ADL is after me so I think Israel has to
live with the bad reputation of the ADL
at a time when they're getting a lot of
um a lot of pressure from the outside
world I do think Israel is giving up
their Holocaust chip um it will never be
the same after this and that doesn't
mean it's the wrong choice from their
perspective so let me give you the
the uh my real opinion of the whole
Hamas Gaza Israel
situation I think anybody who's picking
the moral Winning
Side is probably in some kind of a
losing
conversation because we first of all we
don't have any influence at least I
don't I I have no influence over that so
my take is it's like gravity my my take
on the region is that whoever's in
charge is going to be the warden and
whoever is not in charge is going to be
in jail if you were to reverse the
situation the Israelis would feel like
they're in jail even if it's not true
and it would look like the wardens were
the Palestinians currently it looks like
Israel has the most power and whether
it's an accurate statement of what's
happening or not the the Palestinians
feel like they're in jail and the
Israelis are the warden if that's not
going to change and it's not then what
you're then what you're watching is is
just a a power Dynamic playing
out so to have an opinion on it feels to
me like I'm holding a rock in my hand
and I let go of the
rock should I have an opinion about
whether the rock will fall to Earth I
could have an opinion but it would be
absurd the only thing that makes sense
is just to watch it just observe it
because you know it's going to go and
now it's gravity and has nothing to do
with your opinion so when I watch things
in the Middle East I think oh I think I
should add my opinion to this for what
it's just gravity whoever is the
strongest entity is going
to it's going to feel like the weaker
entity is being abused even if it's not
true and the reason is that the systems
are incompatible and they can never be
compatible there is no way that those
those groups the Islamic population and
the Jewish population are going to find
a way to live together in peace with two
two countries next to each other to
imagine that could happen seems so
disconnected from
reality that these are people who by
their their Central belief system can't
possibly get along in the way that you
imagine people of the same belief system
could I I think we make the mistake of
thinking Well it can't be that different
from a red and the blue State and yet we
find ways to live together next to each
other no it's not like that at all it's
not even slightly like that the American
system we can disagree with each other
but we know we're under the same
system right the
constitution in theory is the umbrella
under which we're all arguing so we're
all trying to be the better versions of
adhering to the Constitution you maybe
sometimes you want to tweak it but
you're still talking talking about how
can we be the better version of a
constitutional you know
citizenship nothing like that's
happening over in the Middle East in the
Middle East there are two incompatible
systems that can never be
compatible and there's only going to be
a winner and a loser and at the moment
Israel has the upper
hand to have an opinion on that would be
like having an opinion on gravity it's
just what it is it's it's just what it
is now the opinion I can have is not to
associate my own brand or reputation
with it because again I don't have
anything to do with it so if I if I
embraced it then I'm giving something
away for free for
nothing I I would be giving away my
reputational value what little it has
for nothing it wouldn't make them more
successful or less but it would make me
a victim of whatever you know abuse I
got for having an opinion on it so I
don't support Israel but I don't support
their
enemies I love the Jewish people you
know my personal relationships have
always been amazing with Jewish
citizens as well as Israeli citizens um
probably one of my favor favorite
demographic groups I say that just
because some of you are anti-semitic and
it'll make you mad but yeah but
historically
um everything from dating to my best
friends I I've been very heavily
weighted toward the Jewish population
because I like smart
people is that
okay I like smart people and uh they're
real lot of educated Jewish people and
it's fun to talk to smart
people all right
