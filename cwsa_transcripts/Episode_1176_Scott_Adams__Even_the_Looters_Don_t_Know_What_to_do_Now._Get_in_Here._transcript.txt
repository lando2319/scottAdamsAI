hey everybody
come on in come on in
i know you're tense i know you're not
delighted
in some cases but come on in anyway
because we got some interesting stuff
developing
oh very interesting very interesting
and before we get going uh just to
prepare ourselves what do we need
yes we need a copper mug or a glass of
tanker gels or stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and you
need it you need it bad
and you need it now go
huh i can feel some ballots being
disqualified
with one step that's all it took
all right so i couldn't stop thinking
about last night
last night i was thinking about last
night what would it be like
to be joe biden or trump
but more importantly what would it be
like to be joe biden
and you figure he's probably exhausted
right and he's got to go to
he's got to go to sleep at some point he
probably didn't stay up all night
how would you like to be joe biden and
know that when you go to sleep
last night in all likelihood
when you wake up you're either the most
important person
in the world the president of the united
states
or did
did youtube just stop
somebody's saying youtube isn't working
but i see the comments going by so it
looks like it's working
uh yeah i've got 2 000 people on youtube
so youtube's working
so imagine joe biden he doesn't know if
he's retired
or the president of the united states
what would that do to your head because
you and i
have usually just two choices in life
you know you you apply for a job
and if you don't get it you're unhappy
but it's not
that big a difference between being
unemployed and having that specific job
versus being the president of the united
states
or retired
so at the moment and things are changing
quickly but at the moment it looks like
joe biden has
a stranglehold on the vote at least what
we'll call
phase one of the election
do you think it's going to be all over
when they're done counting the votes
no no this is 2020. in 2020
things don't don't happen the way
they happen in other years so let's just
run down
all the stuff so i've declared that this
is the first
schrodinger's cat election meaning that
there is a winner we just don't know who
it is
now maybe someday we'll be able to you
know look inside the
proverbial box and we'll know if the cat
is alive or the cat is dead
but we can't do it yet there's not quite
enough transparency there's
some small chance i guess that trump
could pull
arizona out and then who knows if he
holds pennsylvania
anything could happen but at the moment
the odds are looking like biden is going
to have an electoral
tiny tiny advantage when the votes are
counted
we'll see now
what did we learn last night number one
how were the professional pollsters
well i would say rasmussen was pretty
close
rasmussen once again you know proves
that they're
they're one of the more accurate ones
but all the pollsters who said that
biden had this gigantic
you know a double-digit advantage
were they lying or were they wrong
or my hypothesis
that there were it was the world's
greatest dad joke
now it would be a better dad joke if
trump had won but i think we can
conclude
that there was something wrong with
those polls and unless you assumed that
they were all colluding and lying or
incompetent i suppose
the only other possibility that i can
think of that's
likely is that trump supporters were
lying like crazy to pollsters
so are we ready to admit that that was
real
or is it too soon if you had the
now that we know the polls were wildly
inaccurate
we didn't know that for sure but now
that we know that for sure
what's the explanation incompetence
collusion meaning they were trying to
influence the vote by
faking it or or showing biden was ahead
so he gets more fundraising or something
so some kind of mischief
incompetence or trump supporter is lying
which
which one do you think is the most
likely explanation
like most things we'll probably never
agree i'm
feeling pretty good about my that
prediction
the other prediction i made is that we
would at some point
not permanently but at some point i
predicted we would have two presidents
now we're not there we're not there i
would not call this situation
that prediction but
we're not done when the votes are
counted you know that right there will
be legal challenges and things
discovered
and let me ask you this just for context
let's say the irs took a dart
and they just threw it at a bunch of
names of
companies and the dart randomly hits the
name of one company and the irs says all
right we're going to audit you
top to bottom we're going to look at
everything you've done
what are the odds that randomly throwing
a dart
the irs would find a company that had
tax violations do you know the answer
that question
because the answer is pretty close to a
hundred percent
now it doesn't mean these companies are
all crooks
but taxes are complicated things happen
judgments are made and if you have a big
rich
target rich environment with complexity
yeah i'm saying in the
in the comments you're saying 100 yeah
anybody with experience
knows that's the case big company
a hundred percent a chance 100 chance
the irs could find
something something they didn't like
now what are the odds that the trump
administration
will look at the outcome of this
election
and they'll look at all the reports that
people are saying of
there was this irregularity in this
irregularity
what are the odds that the trump
campaign will not be able to find
something that's
real you know not just something they
made up
but something that has some substance
that they can complain about
to maybe potentially possibly
overthrow the results of the election
what are the chances
that such an opportunity exists
100 so if you're saying to yourself
are we done once the votes are counted i
doubt it
the same way you know if the irs audits
you they're going to find something
and i'm sure the trump administration
can find something
to make an argument about and of course
they do have
the supreme court on their side but we
don't know if any of it goes to the
supreme court
might it end up at the house of
representatives
as our constitution seems to prefer
that anything could happen here's
another one
what happens if joe biden
is deemed mentally incompetent
before the electoral college
what are they the the electoral college
voters vote
what happens then if they can't cast
their vote for the person who won the
most
votes as far as i know if they can't do
that
because let's say hypothetically he's
just not capable at that point
or maybe there's some legal problem by
that point you can imagine
two scenarios in which something happens
by the way there's no no evidence that
i'm aware of
of biden himself being involved in any
crimes i'm just saying anything could
happen
in a big complicated world you can
accuse anybody of anything
and
yeah what happens then does does kamala
get the electoral college votes
um how does that work does uh
does the house get involved so if you
think that we're done
or near done because you think you know
what the what the end of vote will be
i don't know it's 2020. anything could
happen
let me ask you this what are the odds
that china tried to interfere with the
election
right now that's separate from the odds
that we would catch them
but just what are the odds that they
tried
what do you think what are the odds that
they tried
a hundred percent i don't know
uh i don't know how to put odds on that
but aren't we trying to interfere in
other elections
fairly routinely don't countries
somewhat routinely interfere with other
elections
so suppose china was just routinely
interfering
perhaps like they have in the past
perhaps like russia is doing
you know perhaps as other countries are
doing
who knows and suppose we find something
what then because it would be so obvious
that china
prefers biden what happens if we find
even a little bit of china influence
on the election what then
there's a lot of wild cards here aren't
there if you're
a biden supporter even if you get the
win
i don't know if you can be completely
completely comfortable because who knows
what's going to happen
so um president trump
decided to declare that in his opinion
frankly he did win the election
that's when he was ahead in the vote
count and wanted
wanted future votes i guess not to be
counted or something
but biden had said a little bit more
reserved he said
he he believed he was going to win now
those are different
saying you believe you're going to win
is just always fair
that's always fair for a politician to
say right
so nobody gets in trouble for saying i
believe i will win
but if you say i did win and they're
still counting votes
that's a that's kind of a stretch but
did it give
trump a strategic advantage in claiming
that he had won
maybe maybe it would you know get his
base on his side if he wants to fight it
on some technicality
so it might give him some advantage
um what kind of irregularities are we
seeing
so uh this is the point in the process
where you shouldn't believe anything you
see yeah the the
fake news that you're going to see in
the next few days will be
probably record setting and so one of
the things we're seeing is that there
was something that happened in michigan
where a whole bunch of votes were added
to to biden
sort of suddenly toward the end now
i don't know the details of that and i
would not assume that it means something
untoward happened or that anything
happened
because we're so early in the the fog of
war that i don't even know if it's true
that a bunch of votes got added for
biden at the end
who knows even the basic facts are true
at this point
but that's you know one question there's
another question about
arizona voters who were trump supporters
getting
sharpies to use on their ballots and
that would invalidate them somehow
i don't know if there's anything to that
who knows does a sharpie invalidate your
ballot
i don't know um of course there there
will be
multiple reports of fake ballots and
ballot harvesting ballot harvesting is
legal depending on the state
so there's going to be all kinds of
stuff to look into but
let me ask you this let's say it came
down to michigan
let's say the the vote came down to
whoever won
michigan would be president and let's
say michigan
came down to detroit
it could right or the detroit county or
something
suppose it came down to really just one
metropolitan area
do you think the trump administration
could
find real evidence that that one
metropolitan area no matter what it is
had some bad balance and irregularities
probably right because again
everything big and complicated has a
little bit of corruption
or a little bit of mistake or a little
bit of incompetence
so if you just said randomly throw your
dart
at the map of the united states hit a
city
and then really do a deep dive on that
city
are you gonna find any problems probably
right it's it's a big world there's lots
of opportunities for that stuff
um so
59 of my followers on an uh
unscientific twitter poll say they think
the election
has been unfair 59
now it's unscientific and most of my
followers are trump supporters
so you'd expect that they would be trump
sporting in their
answering of the poll but that's a lot
of people
even unscientific so
what would happen if trump's supporters
think that the election was not fair
if it goes through the right process
they will accept it in other words if
i i don't know if the house is involved
or somebody checks the votes and
checks for the irregularities or the
supreme court makes the decision
if there's something that looks like a
constitutional process
i think trump supporters are going to
grudgingly accept the result
even while doubting that it was
legitimate as long as the process
looks like it was followed um so i don't
think there's gonna be civil war in that
specific sense
now the weirdest thing about where we
are right now
is that even the looters don't know what
to do
you know i tweeted that uh it's it's a
joke but not really a joke
because what are all the protesters and
the
the people who have assembled in the
streets what do they do if biden wins
do you know i don't really know
i don't know do they go home if biden
wins
because that's one possibility they'll
just go home
but if biden wins don't you still have a
problem with
black lives matter and police brutality
according to them
there shouldn't be any difference right
because the issues that blm and antifa
had
don't really change if you change the
president
i don't think so so are we going to
watch
antifa become the
the ally of republicans
because you know the enemy of my enemy
situation antifa is going to turn on
biden
right because antifa is not democrats
they're they're antifa they don't have a
party per se
so they should turn on biden pretty
quickly you
expect the squad to turn on biden
they've already done that
so they're going to start demanding
stuff now here's my question to you
let's say the senate holds republican it
looks like it will barely right
maybe by one one vote
or something like that maybe it's just
pence who's the tiebreaker
or one vote plus pence something like
that
is that enough to stop
biden or let's say stop the squad from
going full socialist
would a would a republican senate be
enough
to stop that stuff from happening if you
only have a you know one vote advantage
i don't know if that's enough
but it might be it could be that the the
thing that would surprise me the least
and indeed i've predicted this in the
past
is that a a regular democrat
president would have to govern like
trump did policy-wise so
my my assumption is that uh trump proved
enough things to work in other words he
tried
different things and they worked such
that whoever is president next
kind of has to do that because it worked
for example
do you think that do you think that a
president biden
would just stop all work on border
security
probably not right because
it's not really good for biden if things
get out of control
at the border that means that democrats
lose the next election
so even democrats can't really open the
border
because they would never get you know
they'd never get elected again
so what about say north korea is biden
going to get
tough with kim jong-un probably not
he'll probably take something close to a
trump approach
which is well we won't threaten you if
you don't threaten us
something like that do you think that a
biden
biden would just stop negotiating a
trade deal with
uh with china so
he says in all caps trump tweeted
it must be a good one so let's let's go
look at that
let's see what trump is tweeting if it's
so good
that you just had to tell me
all right
so he says three minutes ago trump says
how come every time they count mail-in
ballot dumps
they are so devastating in their
percentage and power of destruction
that's sort of a generic thing to say
16 minutes ago he said last night i was
leading often
solidly in many key states in almost all
instances
democrat run and controlled then
one by one they started to magically
disappear
as surprise ballot dumps were counted
very strange and the quote pollsters got
it completely and historically wrong
so it looks like he's setting it up for
the uh
the mail-in ballots to be the
the fraudulent thing that cost in the
election
um what do you think do you think that's
real
is your opinion if if you were not just
being a team player
if you were not just you know backing
your candidate if you stepped away
and said to yourself okay if i'm being
objective
i'm a space alien i'm just looking at
this situation
do you think that the election was
stolen by
mail-in ballots
what do you think now i do believe that
fraud is somewhat
universal meaning that probably you know
every state
every county had a little bit of
irregularity
and there probably is like that every
time but do you think the
mail-in ballots really were like
legitimately they had a bunch of them
waiting
and they just waited to see what their
vote was and then they said all right
we don't need all of them but let's use
half of the one the fake ones we had and
dump them out there
do you think that happened
because it would only have to happen and
like i said maybe you only needed to do
it in detroit
or you know one or two places so you
wouldn't have to do it everywhere all
over
you would just need a few places that's
it
so looking at your comments i'm seeing
some yeses
some some no's
etc now i think the real
the real issue is going to come down to
how many of them
can be rejected because there's some
signature problem or something
else and
i don't know how you ever solve that
so it looks like trump supporters
believe that there was a major fraud
involved
it looks like the president is very
persuasive
or he's or who he's following i don't
know if he's leading or following in
this case
but he does seem to match his base
that the majority think that something
illegal or fraudulent happened
i don't know how to handicap that
somebody says do you still think trump
will win
well my most recent
prediction is at least for a time we
would have two presidents
and that cnn would say we have a
president biden
and fox news would say they're not
saying that now
but that they will at some point say uh
we have a president trump
uh re-election and that would happen
if if trump managed to
wage a let's say a legal attack against
the result
it had some teeth so if
trump comes up with some kind of a
fraudulent accusation or accusation of
fraud
and there's actually some evidence
you never know but if the if the vote
goes the way it's just being counted
straight up
it looks like you biden would win at at
the moment it looks like that
then i'm just saying what the news is
telling you
um so here's a question if you thought
that
let's say you had a theory that israel
secretly controls all the big decisions
in this country
did you believe that did you think that
israel was really
running the show because israel wanted
trump to win
so if israel was behind any mischief
either they didn't do anything
or they did something that wasn't as big
as the mischief from the other side
so can you rule out that israel has
that much power over the political
process of this country
i feel like if this if this holds
would be a pretty good example of how
they didn't get what they wanted
what would biden do with all these peace
deals that are happening in the middle
east would he reverse them and go
pro iran probably not
it's sort of too late for that isn't it
so the one thing you should wonder about
is if biden could do
any of the things that he says he wants
or would he be forced by circumstance
to simply do something very close to
what trump was doing
but you know put a new name on it and
try to pretend it's different
somebody says does israel really want
trump to win
i think yeah i think you could say that
with some confidence
yes uh arizona has two percent left to
count so that that wouldn't get it done
so that we have to assume that that goes
to biden
so let's let's say let's say biden
gets inaugurated and he becomes the
president
what will we say was the reason some of
you will say fraud
and you'll say that forever
i think you also have to look at the
social media companies
because at this point i don't know
if humans can overcome the algorithms
you know i call the algorithms
artificial intelligence
and i had said that whether trump wins
or loses
that he'll be the last human president
meaning that a.i if a.i
and the algorithms are what caused biden
to win and of course they did
of course they did right because the
stories that get promoted are the ones
that
influence so the algorithms
probably picked the president so so one
filter you could look at this
is that the the human activity was
somewhat irrelevant
because a.i caused us to do what we did
so it was really
in charge that's one way to look at it
the other way
is that the democrats just did a good
job
on everything they did a good job
getting in
more you know more people who would vote
their way into the country
did a better job of campaigning
controlled the media better
that's another way to look at it
somebody
some people say the ai is made by humans
scott
there is where you are completely uh
misled so yes it is true that the ai
is designed by humans but do you believe
that any humans
know what the ai will do
nope they don't now they do have the
power
to force the ai or the algorithm to do a
certain thing they have the power
but do you think that's how they
designed it do you think they designed
it so they know exactly what it's going
to do
i don't i think he has so many variables
that nobody who is human knows exactly
what the algorithm is going to do
they know what they programmed but they
don't know what it's going to do
and under that condition would you say
that the human is in charge
if they don't know what their creation
is going to do
suppose you built a frankenstein monster
you're in charge of the monster right so
then do you control the monster after it
leaves your laboratory and starts
destroying the town
could you say hey dr frankenstein
stop your monster i mean you're the
human you made it
so you're in control right it doesn't
work that way
once the frankenstein leaves the
laboratory which is what
the algorithms are they're frankenstein
outside the laboratory
the the coder or dr frankenstein can't
control it anymore
so when you say humans make the ai
true but a human makes doc
dr frankenstein's human and he made the
frankenstein monster
but he doesn't control it after it
leaves the laboratory
um
all right um
can't there be overfitting
somebody says the media stole the
election i would say that's
true if you were to look at biden voters
and ask them you know what do they think
is true
they would just say hoax after hoax
after hoax so
biden is elected on a hoax basically and
i would say that
you know people ask me what scott why
did you try so hard to
debunk the fine people hoax and the
answer was that it's the ten
pole hoax all the other hoaxes
depend on you thinking that one really
happened because if you think well that
one's proven
if you think it happened it didn't but
if you think you did then you start
thinking well the other unproven ones
probably true because this one was
proven
so that kind of makes me think the other
ones are true
and i think biden with the help of the
media sold it as true enough
that i'm sure it changed the result i
mean there was a reason that he led with
it all the time
in his campaign i would imagine that
they do
research on that stuff right don't you
think that
biden's campaign stump speech
was a whole bunch of poll tested points
so they they knew that the
charlottesville thing
had an impact i don't think he would
have led with it consistently
if they hadn't tested it to know that it
made a difference
so probably the fine people hoax made
him president
i mean that's an irrational thing to say
because in these situations that are
complicated and there are so many
variables if you change
any of them you get a different result
so you could say
it was foreign interference
because that was one percent of the
difference you could say it was the fine
people oaks
because that was one percent of the
difference and you know it was only
a one percent kind of vote so you could
always say that there was something that
was the difference
but really everything had to be the way
it is or you wouldn't get this result
all right somebody says biden's not
elected yet
yeah i suppose in the category of
anything could happen
um yeah the fine people hoax is still a
lie that's true
you know so here's here's the real
question will biden getting elected
will it um will it cause
less violence in the streets what do you
think
do you think that the riots will just
stop and i'm wondering if this isn't the
very best
situation for um
republicans and they don't realize it
because
the rioters really needed
a solid trump victory in order to be
activated
but what if they just think well i don't
know what's happening yet
uh i feel like looting but
the trigger wasn't there so
do i take the day off i don't know what
to do
and quite literally i don't think they
know what to do
so somebody says that biden president
means more violence
in the streets well do you think that
democratic mayors could get tougher with
the
protesters if they had a democratic
president
maybe maybe it's a nixon goes to
china's situation and suddenly all the
democratic mayors could get tough
because hey they're not trying to show
that trump is
orange man bad we shall see
so i'm seeing some people say the riots
will stop immediately
if they do you really gotta wonder about
stuff
yeah i don't i don't see any energy
whatsoever
for republicans to take over now what do
you think about
uh trump leaving office
if let's say he goes through his legal
challenges and they don't work
or he he uses the system as well as he
can but he can't get a different result
do you think there's any chance that
trump would try to stay in office
if he had exhausted his appeals i don't
think so
i think the odds of that are zero
not even you know one percent i think
it's zero
uh but what if it's inauguration day
and there's still an open question of
massive fraud
what then what then indeed
well i think that the uh with the help
of the media
the media can simply sell a biden
victory
no matter how much fraud was involved
and the public will
enough of the public will accept it so
that looks like the direction we're
going now
because it's 2020 you cannot rule out
another surprise and the other surprise
would be
some easy to prove
fraud so
what do you think of the odds that the
trump administration will be able to
point to something
specific you know not just a general hey
i don't like these mail-in ballots but
something like that has a video
or a witness or or something you could
just look at
and you know it's fraud what are the
odds of something like that
will emerge in the next i don't know 48
hours or a week or whatever
pretty high right pretty high
because when you need a when you need a
fraud
you can always find one i feel i feel
like it doesn't
doesn't take much work to find a fraud
in any of these situations
yeah according to the constitution
somebody's saying pelosi is
third in line so even pelosi could get
into the
the work here all right um
let's see and pelosi actually lost
democrats in the house so if you're
looking at how bad the polling was
look at how bad
well i mean they got everything wrong
right so the polls thought that the
house would pick up democrats it didn't
it thought that the senate would flip it
didn't
and certainly thought that the
presidential election
would be you know an overwhelming biden
victory
but it wasn't so the polls were
quite quite off and everything that
mattered
so in a little side story uh
oregon became the first state to
decriminalize hard drugs
that it's like a little side story that
is sort of big
so they decriminalized heroin cocaine
and meth
wow um and by a pretty solid vote
people really wanted that and i guess
they're replacing that
with some kind of humane cost-effective
health approach
i am very much in favor of this it would
have been a mistake
for the entire country to do this all at
the same time
but remember what i tell you about
anything that you can test
locally or small you should if you think
if you think it might work give it a
test but test is small
so you don't ruin the whole country so
now oregon
is going to give us some data that will
be really useful
and i would say that addiction is maybe
the biggest problem in the country right
now
so if they can get any any kind of
progress on that that would be a big
deal
by the way if if trump did lose and does
lose
it's going to be because of healthcare
and coronavirus don't you think
i mean those will kind of be the reasons
um here is a
oh so here's a phrase that you might
hear
this is from ross garber on twitter
who's got some credentials and he says
unless the vote is close enough
there's no chance for the lawyers to
kick a legal field goal
unless it's close enough all right so
far too many uncounted ballots in too
many key places
keep an eye on what he calls the margin
of litigation
all right so i think maybe he said
something wrong in his tweet but what i
take as
his meaning is that if the distance
if the final count between biden
and trump is small it might be a small
enough distance
that a successful litigation of
something specific
say one state or one metropolitan area
might be enough to overturn it but
if the biden gap is bigger
then even if you have a successful
litigation of some sort
you might not change anything enough to
close that gap
so you might hear this phrase the margin
of litigation
is he close enough that a legal
challenge could make a difference
um don't you think you would find
some pleasure if you're a trump
supporter and it turns out biden
is is the winner would you find some
pleasure
in watching the squad tear him apart
because because he's going to get i mean
he'll just
it'll be ripped down to the bone i think
by the progressives
so watching that will sort of be fun
um and it looks like
if biden is president all of the russia
collusion
coup people will go free we'll stay free
i guess
so it looks like crime pays so far
so far i would say we have strong
evidence that crime pays
and that the coup attempt with the
russia collusion hoax
looks like nobody's going to get
punished for that looks like that was
just a free slap
and and it will actually uh be part of
what causes biden to win
so i would say that that just sort of
worked it just didn't work the year that
they wanted to work
but it had a spillover effect into this
election for sure
somebody says trump tweets are being
filtered by
twitter again well anything where he
claims
victory is going to get filtered
uh will will trump's crimes pay well i
don't know of any trump crimes
all right um
the the hardest part about this will be
all of the
gloating democrats so i might have to
take a uh
social media holiday just just until
they get less excited
somebody's telling me to look at trump's
newest tweets i don't know if those are
the ones i
just looked at but let's see um
oh there's one that's being
filtered oh
so matt walsh has tweeted something that
uh twitter is
trying very hard for me not to see so
i'm at my second level of warning here
and so matt walsh says this is reason
enough to go to court
no honest person can look at this and
say it's normal and unconcerning and the
way he's talking about
is this uh idea that michigan
went up 128 000 votes for biden with
no extra votes for trump at the same
time
so i believe that's the claim that the
key state
of michigan had an unexpected surge in
votes
and conservatives are pointing it out
and trump is saying what is this all
about in caps
now remember i told you that the odds of
finding
something irregular is kind of a hundred
percent
now suppose suppose this is fraud
now i think the greater odds are always
that it's not
right if you're going to bet on it
they'll probably bet that it's not
but you certainly have to ask the
question
why does it look like that i think if
you dig down you'll find out that
there's more
more to it and maybe it's not what it
looks like but it could be
it could be i'm not saying it's not
fraud
it certainly has all of the telltale
signs of fraud
if you were going to do fraud it would
look sort of like this
so the question has to be asked and
answered but that doesn't mean
it's what you think it is um
and then what else has he got here let's
see yeah and then
then the president retweeted someone
else talking about this 128
000 votes in michigan you know
one way this could go quite easily
what if he challenges just that and it's
enough
so so already
already you can see the wisdom of
ross garber's comment about the margin
of litigation
so somebody tell me because i don't know
if
trump challenged just that 128 000
votes that looked sort of suspicious
because 100
of them went to biden if he challenged
just that
and he succeeded would it change the
result
is he within the margin of litigation
as ross garber says i don't know
i don't know if this could be more
interesting or more frustrating
if if you tried how in the world did
this simple process that has worked for
hundreds of years
become this complicated
um and
could you ever be convinced that it
wasn't fraud
if it turns out that the basic facts
being alleged are true
let's say it's true that 128
000 votes appeared suddenly and a
hundred percent of them were biden
and that's the story if that was the
final story
and we never got any deeper explanation
would you accept this election as valid
i don't know to me it would depend a
little bit about whether that one
change would would change the result if
it would
well if it would you got some real
questions there
somebody says please don't have a
defeatist attitude about this
well it's not defeatist uh
i would say that the odds of a
of a challenge that's got some meat to
it is pretty good
i don't know if that wins the day but
there's a pretty good chance the
president has a
as a case and if he could find a way to
get that case to the supreme court
does he have an advantage because of his
conservative judges
maybe
so somebody says kudos on uh and
keeping going today well let me ask you
people how do you feel
how do you feel today now of course you
feel uncertainty and
stomach aches and all that but
is your life ruined will your food taste
differently today
will you will your job change for most
of you
you're not going to be able to tell the
difference frankly for some
of us it will be a life-changing event
if biden gets in and gets his tax plan
for example
people like me have to make some real
decisions about
literally leaving the country because
the tax rate that
biden has proposed
is confiscatory if i think that's a word
right confiscatory meaning that
i made my money under a certain set of
rules in other words capitalism and the
government said here are your rules
if you follow these rules and make some
money you get to keep it
that's what i thought were the rules if
i follow all of your
constitutional rules and your laws and i
make a bunch of money
and i live in the united states i get to
keep it
i thought that was the deal now if i had
been told from the beginning
you know you can make as much money as
you want but you're going to have to
give
65 of it to the government and by the
way that's
low the 65 of it is just your regular
taxes
if you're in a high tax zone i would
also
be paying property tax i'd also be
paying sales tax
so my effective tax rate if you take all
of my taxes
under biden might be 75
i might get to keep 25 percent of every
dollar i earn
that's enough to make you look at
another country
but it isn't that easy to just move to
another country and avoid taxes you got
to
give up your citizenship and it's not
easy
so it's no it's no easy deal just to
move somewhere else
it's it's not something you can do plus
you want to live in the country with the
biggest military
you know you don't want to live in the
little island that can be conquered by
just about anybody who wants to
i don't want to live on a little island
that can be destroyed by a hurricane
either
so it's hard to move out of the united
states it's a little bit of a network
effect if you know what i mean
somebody says they won't let you go
um oh somebody says the market is up
is it let's see so
markets like certainty so
amazon is way up well that's interesting
um bitcoin has been having a run
so that's staying solid the
the broader market is up solidly
apple's way up israel's up
the i've got a fund of stocks in israel
and that's way up
um interesting
what the hell okay
um
i'm just looking at a comment uh did you
notice they changed the way
we voted at the last minute
just looking at your comments
somebody says it's stupid to leave stay
and fight
yeah i don't think taxes will
go the direction of the biden tax plan
i think that if there's a republican
senate
and the democrats want to stay in power
for a while that they probably can't do
that
the wan is tanking again interesting
what what is the betting market has gone
biden right
the betting market has gone completely
biden so
somebody asked me about simulation
theory so let me
let me put this in a frame you've heard
before
if this is a simulation and
as i've said there's a tendency for life
to follow the path of the best movie
what would be the best movie
think about it if this were a movie and
everything that had happened
up to this point is what happened in the
movie what would be the movie ending
do you know what it would be the movie
ending
would be finding out that those michigan
votes were fraudulent
and that and this is the third act
because the point of the third act is
that you're supposed to feel
as if it's over like you're actually
supposed to think okay
seriously no joking aside
it's done now it's a little bit how you
might have felt the day the
access hollywood tape came out right
before the
2016 election when i heard that
my feeling was the first time i heard it
i came out of it
but the first time i heard that i said
that's it
there isn't any way anybody in the world
can recover from this excess hollywood
tape
now it took me a few days to realize
that wasn't the case and came back to
predicting trump would win but that was
the third act
in my opinion that was the point where
even the biggest believer
the biggest optimist capitulates
and says all right all right there's
just no hope
there's no hope left and then
the hero pulls out a victory
in a way that was completely unexpected
and the obvious way that would happen
would be to find out that there was some
fraud that changed the election
and find out in time to reverse the
outcome
so this will be a good test of the
simulation slash movie hypothesis
this the the movie simulation theory
suggests that trump will reverse uh
reverse some of the votes
now if i said to you there's a there's a
presidential candidate and he's going to
challenge the votes
and he's going to have them reversed and
it will be enough of them
that it changes the election what would
you say in general
in general you'd say i don't think so i
don't know if any president who's ever
done that
but it's trump
trump consistently does things you
didn't think were possible
i don't have to do the list you've seen
the list but you know he's
he's finding peace in the middle east he
consistently does the thing you think i
don't think anybody could do oh he just
did it
so if you say to me the only way he
could win
is to do this highly unlikely play
of getting a bunch of votes tossed out
very
unlikely that anybody could succeed at
that
but it's 2020. and it's trump
he could i'm not i'm not going to
predict it
i'm going to say that if the movie
filter holds
this was the third act and i have to say
that there was nothing that happened
before this
that felt completely third acne
the other things that have happened
before this seemed big but they didn't
quite seem like a crushing final blow
today's vote count feels like a
crushing final blow doesn't it so that's
either real
or it's the third act we'll find out
somebody says trump should pardon hunter
i don't know what good that is
uh somebody says they prefer the low
budget movie where nevada turns red in a
few hours somehow
yeah maybe um so the slaughter meter
at least in terms of the vote i would
say is pretty close to zero
so in terms of winning it on the first
count
i would say the odds of trump winning it
just because the votes came in his way
is pretty close to zero at this point
the odds of
prevailing in the long run
still exist meaning that uh when he digs
into this
michigan vote count there might be
something there
i'd bet against it there might be
something there
so we'll find out all right um
this is what we know so far
it's so 2020 uh
that it that it it couldn't be more
2020.
so we'll find out what's what and we'll
find out uh
if there's any room for this to change
and i will talk to you
soon
