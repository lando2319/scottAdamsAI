[Music]
do do
oh hello earthquake
good morning and welcome to the
highlight of human civilization
where
the light comes on just in time there we
go that's that's called oh good because
sound is good
thank you for the uh sound check there
and wouldn't you like to know
what happened at the debates last night
and what people are thinking and what
what the reframers are thinking and all
that yes it's here it's here if you'd
like to take your experience up a level
all you need is a couple of mugro glass
so take your Chelsea style the canteen
geography a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous zip
it happens now go
oh I have a request please don't talk
forever about my book oh all right let's
start with the book
book is number well a moment ago it was
number 11 on all of Amazon do you know
how many Kindle books there are
guess how many Kindle books there are on
Amazon
48 million that's just Kindle
my book in all its forms was number 11
on all of Amazon when I woke up this
morning
Still Still somewhere around there
and number one on movers and shakers so
I appreciate the request not to talk
about my book I wasn't going to do that
but
I guess I just don't like to be bullied
on my own live stream so if there's
anything else you don't want me to talk
about I'll do that right away so let's
make that rule
um so yes and by the way I've never seen
so many people buy multiple copies of a
book
it's crazy
it's really crazy people are buying two
10 copies
uh I've never seen anything like it
so it's doing better than I even
expected it's doing great so we'll see
changing the world
India reached the South Pole of the Moon
for apparently a discount price didn't
cost them too much to do it no country
has ever successfully landed on the
South Pole of the Moon and now you ask
me Scott
why is the South Pole of the moon
important well there's some indication
there's some ice there and if there's
ice there's water and if there's water
you could build a base and if you can
build a base you could control the
entire Earth with your Superior
space-based
base I guess you know
it's probably almost essential to
survival
that the United States controls the Moon
because whoever controls the moon seems
like in the in the long long run you
know in your 100 Year span how in the
world could you be somebody who had a
moon base
I don't know I guess you'd kill all the
supplies supply places on Earth but
anyway it seems dangerous to let anybody
else have a uh base on the moon
but if it had to be anybody India would
be just about my Top Choice
so I love the fact that India is an ally
of the United States
I I feel like if you had to pick an ally
you know if you pick you know Israel is
a great Ally right
but they're a little bit expensive
cause a little trouble right you know
maybe no fault of their own you might
argue but you know not all of our allies
are equally beneficial but I don't know
how we could go into the next hundred
years
without India being on our side
it feels like that's just necessary so
I'm glad they are
uh we'll get to the debates of course
I'm just letting people stream in here
so we've got more people
uh Dr Jordan Peterson
has an update you know the is it the
College of Toronto or the something like
that but uh he's he's being required for
his profession to keep his credentials
in Canada
he has to be retrained so he doesn't say
mean things about trans people or about
probably about you know and just think
about this the people who decided that
he needed to to be re-educated
were appointed by Trudeau
and Jordan Peterson is one of the most
prominent critics of Trudeau
so the people that Trudeau
elected are now getting the revenge on
them
Canada is just up
I mean I used to respect Canada but
honestly I I don't
you know I love Canadian people of
course Canadian people are just the
coolest
yeah I'll give you that
all right I'll give you that the people
of Canada
pretty cool country no doubt about it
but your government my God I mean ours
is terrible too at the moment but I used
to think well no matter how bad thing
how many of you have ever had this
thought
no matter how bad things are in the
United States
you could always go to Canada
like that was my backup School
right it's not really the backup school
anymore is it
because it looks like weaponization of
the government to me to me it looks like
free speeches go on weaponized
government
uh you know Mass surveillance cutting
off your bank account if you're a pro
that is not a country I want to move to
so good good work destroying a brand
that took you hundreds of years to
create
yeah name one country that a better
brand than Canada
can you even think of anything that
anybody criticized Canada for 10 years
ago 10 years ago nobody had a single bad
word to say about Canada
it was just like a smaller America but
cooler you know cooler physically but
also the people seem to be more chill
and now it just looks like some horrible
thing happened there with the government
all right well uh let's watch this Dr
Jordan Peterson thing because I think we
need to be unified to the degree it
helps because he wants to give them as
much attention as he can uh
this is one of his tweets from Dr
Peterson so they want to re-educate him
effectively train him and he says trade
me you bastards and Watch What Happens
now suppose legally he's required to go
to training
could we get a video of that
could you could you possibly give me a
more entertaining scenario
than Jordan Peterson being retrained
against his will
ah no I would watch that show all day
long if you could make a special out of
this number one
I mean please right please and you know
my my suggestion in these situations is
Embrace and amplify
I just heard from somebody who took some
corporate training and used the
technique of embracing and amplifying in
other words agreeing with it too much to
the point where it all falls apart it
apparently he was not welcome
he became unwelcome in the glass because
he was agreeing too much
to the point where everybody was like
this is crazy yeah it is yeah that was
the point it's crazy
all right
um
Lionsgate apparently is bringing back
Mass they're uh movie studio
but at first I thought oh here's the one
we need to boycott because you got to
take out the first company
the the first big company
that you know brings back masks I think
they have to be bankrupted it doesn't
matter who it is could be your most
beloved company if you want your freedom
you have to destroy the first company
that caves
so you have to have to put the pressure
on but it turns out Lionsgate was
requiring masks in a few floors of one
office
because there was a little outbreak
there
it's not it's not the one I want to do
right if if they had said the whole
company everybody required I'd be like
okay you know it's go time
but I feel like I need a little more
than
two floors of one building temporarily
like I don't like it but you know
they're afraid it's them it's not me
I just want a big company to get say
Mass masks are required then we we take
them out
is everybody on board
that we have to boycott the first big
company that requires masks of its
customers or its employees remember
you're you're protecting their employees
as well well indirectly it may not may
be bad for the employees if they go out
of business more likely it would just
drive their stock down to a place where
they can't keep their jobs meeting the
executives not the employees
so we got to hit him hard waiting for so
let me know the moment the moment the
first one caves let's just Bud Light the
 out
all right nine of Trump's lawyers have
been arrested in Georgia
I could end the entire live stream on
that
because in a way that describes
everything bad that's happening in the
world let me just say it again
nine of Trump's lawyers were arrested
for doing what I believe is their job of
lawyering now if you think that their
advice was bad
well maybe it was I'm no lawyer so how
would I judge it but you can't jail
somebody's lawyers for bad advice
yeah they're really going to have to
come up with the goods but I don't think
that they care if they're guilty the
people who you know indicted I don't
think they care I think this is about
sending a chilling message that if
you're a lawyer and you work with Trump
you'll never work again
I think that's all that's happening so I
think that they're just you know
chipping away at all things as support
Trump and they're willing to take down
nine lawyers and the rule of law and
every every standard that we have in
America about Justice and freedom and
everything else they're willing to
actually sacrifice every standard of
American Excellence to get Trump
nothing's more important than our court
system and this isn't this is
it's monstrous it's monstrous
absolutely monstrous on the plus side
Jenna Ellis takes a great mug shot
did you see all the mugshots Rudy
Giuliani and a bunch of people and you
know that for some reason they do the
mug shots like this
that it's like they lean forward and
scowl
and then Jenna Ellison gives the you
know like an Instagram smile it's just a
big big smile and I thought well that
was the smartest play
because she knows that picture is going
to be everywhere and she manages to take
a picture that wasn't just pretty good
it's actually like a good picture
you know it looks like one of the
pictures you would pick from your own
camera roll if you wanted to send it to
somebody that you liked
I see that if I take such a good picture
it's neither here nor there but it was a
good picture
all right here's how to tell uh who the
bad guys are Ted Liu Democrat
uh wants to remind you in a tweet that
uh you know that Trump is not above the
law and neither of these either of these
lawyers like Rudy Giuliani
and darn it he's got those top secret
documents and stuff
and I say
have you noticed that we haven't heard a
thing about the contents of those secret
documents
do you believe at this point oh NPC D
Bruce we found an NPC what would the
NPCs say
let's see if you can guess it don't look
on locals don't look on YouTube what
would an NPC say if I say that Jenna
else took a good photograph on a mugshot
go
what would they say
no you know it
that's right they would say that I love
her that I have a crush on her that's
what the NPCs say so if you want to make
sure you're not an NPC
don't say that
yeah well you must want to marry her
yeah that's what the NPC say
all right so Ted Lou reminds us that
these people the lawyers and Trump are
not above the law I tell you again that
when somebody says somebody's not above
the law they are the bad guys
almost always
do you know what I I never hear on the
right maybe I'm wrong about this I'll
take a fact check on this
when there's a real crime people never
say
nobody's above the law
true or false when there's a real crime
people don't say that they because they
say well it's a real crime we have a
justice system what is there to talk
about real crime
justice system
aren't we done yes we're done
because you only say nobody's above the
law when you're trying to put them below
the law it's the only time
because otherwise have you ever heard
the phrase uh as a Shakespeare thou doth
protest too much
like you're you're fighting too hard to
make a point that nobody was asking
about
who was talking about him being above
the law
where did that come into the
conversation if you have to say it it's
a very clear admission that you're
trying to somebody
so Ted Liu you
you just revealed yourself as being an
illegitimate player on the most
important playing field in the world
totally uncool by the way I like Ted
Ted's kind of cool
Ted lose one of these happy Warriors you
know he just backs his team and stuff
but the the whole uh
the whole uh not above the law that's
too far that is too far let me tell you
what I never want to hear from any of my
uh elected officials do not ever tell me
this that somebody's not above the law
because then I just know you're going
after them it's just obvious do you know
what I've never heard
about
um Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and their
there are various allegations
I've never heard any anybody say Well
they're not above the law have you
no
do you know why because their crimes are
or well let's say they're activities I
don't know what's a crime because I'm
not a lawyer but their activities are
entirely transparent we we see it all
now
so why would you even have that
conversation about somebody being Above
the Law what do what do conservatives
say instead of above the law
what are the two-tier justice system
two-tier justice system is that fair
it's absolutely fair I don't know that
the two tiers
are only Democrat and Republican because
there's another two tiers which is rich
people and poor people so there's sort
of four tiers
or is that three depends out depends how
you do the Venn diagram
so yeah two-tier justice system to my
ears now I may I may be biased on this
right I might be biased but to my ears
two-tier Justice is an objective
an objective uh description of two
situations that are similar but treated
differently and we can all see it that
feels like an actual criticism
but not above the law no that's
brainwashing manipulation right
there
all right
um
my tweet I did the other day in which I
was mocking CNN for their interview of
Vivek is approaching 10 million views
why was that my best was that my best
tweet
it was all right it was all right
let me tell you what I'm seeing
Vivek
is an energy monster
that's going to be a little bit of a
theme for the for what I'll talk about
with the debates the vague
is an energy monster
10 million views for me mocking CNN
treating him who gets ten one who gets
10 million uh views
like I don't I mean I've got a million a
million followers but a normal tweet of
mine would be you know 10 20 000. I get
10 million now I know the vague
retweeted it Etc but you can feel the
energy right what do you think would be
the biggest tweet or the biggest traffic
if I tweeted any of the other candidates
who are on the stage so just once in the
stage what do you think I could have not
10 million
well if I'd done a really good DeSantis
a really good DeSantis tweet what do you
think the traffic would have been
a million half a million I don't even
think it would be that
yeah you can feel the energy all right
but that's the theme going into it
I looked at the Wall Street Journal to
see how they covered the debates and
they've got a feature article on vivek's
performance
that's right Wall Street Journal
featured vivek's performance and didn't
really do a lot about the other people
I uh I always watch CNN after a debate
because I watch it for entertainment
but usually it's a you know it's like a
trump debate is what I'm used to lately
and then CNN will be all TDS and it's
hilarious to watch because they'd just
be flipping out and crazy and just
batshit nuts
so I turned on CNN after this debate
expecting you know something like TDS
complete breakdown Republicans of the
devil Etc and I'm going to be fair
they did a really good job
it was it was the damnedest thing I I
had to check that I was on the right
Network
but here's why first of all Trump was
not in it so that's the big thing right
so if you take Trump out
and then you're dealing with a bunch of
people that nobody on the CNN panel
thinks is going to be in the final
election I don't think they think any of
them are serious
so they were free to Simply talk about
how they performed
and then when I watched really
experienced smart people on CNN you know
John King as one example uh doing a just
an analysis of you know performance and
technique
quite good it was quite good so I'll
give them I'll give them a little uh
pattern Pat in the back there however
they do have one guy named David Axelrod
who's you know not only on CNN but he's
a notable advisor you know Insider for
the Democrats
he was full narrative
and it really stuck out as inappropriate
like the the other people were simply
talking about the people about they
performed very good that's a good job
and if that's the new CNN I'd watch it
honestly if they can do more of that I'd
watch it but I think it was a special
case and then Axelrod is just pushing
the Democrat narrative I mean completely
disconnected from what you just watched
you know just trying to connect it
somehow but you know just pushing
narrative and it was just gross
you know watching him just
pushing the narrative basically so I
don't think he should be on the air at
all I think he I think he's
I think he heard CNN's credibility
and I'm not saying that about the other
people who have had their biases but at
least they did a whole show where they
were just given their opinions and not
being you know just an advertisement for
a party
by the way the Republicans do the same
thing so I'm not picking on just
Democrats here
all right
um
here's something that they CNN quoted on
their web page about Vivek
uh by the way uh CNN the thought of a
won the in my opinion it looked like CNN
thought ramaswami was the one of the two
winners I'll get to that in a minute but
here's a quote they have on the webpage
from the fake ramaswamy they who said
the biggest myth in American democracy
is that we actually elect our leaders
Rama Swami says in the in a video posted
to social media so this wasn't about
wasn't about the debate but they were
just characterizing him we don't go
through the uh we don't we go through
the motions the real people who run the
show are part of an
acronymist acronymist meaning acronyms
three-letter alphabet soup in the
federal government you know the FBI is
and cdcs and fdas and all those guys now
the fact that they they're highlighting
like you know extended quotes
who else had an extended quote on CNN
dad do you remember the extended quotes
of the other kitten no he's the only one
who's saying anything interesting
all right more on that
um so CNN seemed to characterize it as
Vivek uh was the obvious standout
you know he was very much the obvious
standout if you woke up the next morning
what did you think about
just think about it when if you watch
the debate and then you woke up the next
morning
which not Trump but which candidate were
you thinking about a little bit of
patents but not maybe not in a positive
way you basically remembered Vivek
do you remember seeing the you know the
sweeping shots of the whole stage and
then you know then there would be lots
of close-ups
is it my imagination or did Vivek make
all of them look like they're ready for
retirement
simply by being young and energetic and
clearly smarter than everybody on the
stage he made them all look like a
retirement home
and and some of them are not that old
you know Tim Scott's not old but he made
them look like last last generation's
idea
just by being there and being young and
being energetic and uh and different
you know he just he just he just lapped
him now to her credit
uh Nikki Haley got a lot of kudos for
standing out maybe maybe he helped her
position
I think women especially liked her when
she talked about abortion
um but my take on her was all I was
hearing was screechy Karen except the
abortion part which she did masterfully
I'm not by the way you're not going to
hear my opinion on abortion I'm going to
talk about a little bit more in terms of
the politics but I don't give my opinion
on abortion
I'll let let women figure it out and
I'll back the majority
I just don't think I add to the opinion
part of it I'll just talk about it from
a political level
so she was great in terms of how she
communicated so that's different than me
agreeing with anything she said right
um but my take on it was she was uh she
was like nails on a chalkboard to my
male ears now this is purely sexist
purely sexist I'm confessing that men
and women you know have some built-in
feelings about gender and stuff like
that but there are some things that men
just can't hear
and her kind of carony voice
which I don't think by the way is
necessarily an indication of her real
personality
but her presentation
was completely
did anybody feel that her presentation
felt like you came home from A Hard
Day's Work
and your your spouse who may have also
had a hard day's work has got to
complain to you for a while yeah so I
think she may have killed it with women
meaning good she she may have actually
had a home run with women because when
women were talking about her they were
they were quite complementary
and even on CNN even on CNN pointed down
she had a good night
but I didn't see it and if you don't
make men happy that you're not going
anywhere all right
CNN's focus group picked Vivek
so seeing that is a focus group and by a
pretty good majority they picked him
so
uh
the other thing that I I guess I wasn't
aware of it but there must have been
some polling that put Vivek at number
two behind DeSantis
so and I feel like I've never seen a
legitimate number two poll I've only
seen him at three
that was anybody confused by that like
it didn't didn't look real
I thought he was three or four or
something but you know he's obviously
been you know soaring up so whatever
they use put him next to DeSantis
labeled him number two now if you had
never heard of a vague which is a lot of
people if you'd never heard of him and
you turn it on and you see he's standing
next to Vivek and he's number two in the
polling
didn't you just go what
and you're like oh I guess I got to pay
attention to this then you wake up the
next day once again he's trending on
Twitter his Clips are dominating CNN
liked him probably the conservatives
were saying good things about him but
also DeSantis and
he just killed it
um
here's some other good Vivek things
we'll talk about the others in a minute
and we'll talk about Trump of course
but I would say uh when I when I look at
a debate I'm kind of only half listening
to the policy stuff
do you have the same feeling
the policy stuff I don't even know if
they mean it at this point because a lot
of things you say but then the real
world makes it impossible you know so
I'm looking for
um charisma
I'm looking for energy I'm looking for
intelligence a quick wittedness for
example I'm looking for balls
man balls and girl bowls uh or let's say
a woman balls
try to make it as Fair as possible I'm
looking for also assertiveness but
within you know within an acceptable
domain
so under that theory things that might
look like mistakes can actually be
advantages because in the energy part if
you're bringing the right energy you get
an advantage so I'll give you an example
of that so if a vague in before he
answered one of his questions he said he
was the only one who could address it
because everyone else on the stage was
bought and paid for
now if you saw that moment you know that
all the other candidates went into a
simultaneous mumble
Victory number one
Vivek was the person talking and he
turned all of his cup competitors into
white noise
that they speaking clearly his
competitors
it was brilliant now the thing he said
they're all bought and paid for I don't
think that's exactly true
do you
yeah do you think I don't know Isa
is you know maybe they are maybe they
all have some billionaire that's back
him but most mostly you feel it's true
right
so whether it's exactly technical true
is actually an advantage because my
first my first impression of it was whoa
that's a little too far
in terms of following the facts
but when I saw the reaction I completely
changed my mind because here's what he
did he owned the entire room by doing
that he made everybody respond to him
which made him the center of attention
so by being the one who made everybody
so angry that they had to respond to
Vivek he became their boss they became
his children and they were all fighting
for can I say something about Vivek how
about me please let me say something
about vivek's comments
 owned them
he just owned
now
uh I'm gonna say that I really loved one
of my favorite moments of the whole
thing was when DeSantis
rejected the Fox News question and took
over did you see that moment
so the question from Martha McCallum was
raise your hand if you believe in
human-caused global warming number one
that is a messed up question
that question is you do not answer that
question because it's not yes no
it's there might be but you know is that
the worst thing or what do we do about
it or what are our options so to
simplify it down to yes no was as bad as
do you still beat your wife that
was bad work so Fox News you should be
ashamed of that question honestly I mean
that was no better than you do you beat
your wife that was just disgusting just
to see the to see these people who are
working hard I mean everybody on a stage
I mean as far as I can tell are working
hard you know taking a lot of you know
stuff on themselves and to get that
treatment
that was completely inappropriate now
what did uh what did they do when that
question was asked
well thankfully DeSantis being
apparently a good leader I'm going to
give him a lot of credit here he stopped
it writing his tracks he said we're not
school children can we just talk about
this
and then he started talking about it and
did a good job talking about it but that
was so Alpha
that to me it was it was the move of the
it was the move of the debate
because he needed to shut down the
question and nobody on the stage did it
now I don't know if they would have
but he was very quick and he just shut
that down
that's good stuff
good stuff let me say some more good
things about DeSantis and we'll get back
to Vivek
well let me finish up with them they
basically owned all the energy got all
the attention left and right was
impressed he'll be everything that we're
talking about so as an energy monster oh
my God you just nailed it he had the
most revolutionary ideas everybody's
talking about uh you know all the
Departments he wants to get rid of the
things he's asking for are bigger than
you imagine is practical perfect
who else does that Trump let's build a
whole wall well that feels bigger than
what you could actually do but you know
maybe something in that direction
Vivek wants to get rid of all these
departments but really you know
distribute their functions is what he's
really saying but that sounds bigger
than real but yet directionally it's
it's what is based totally is interested
in and frankly if you're a Democrat and
you're hearing he wants to cut the fat
out of government are you complaining
is that where you're going to draw draw
the line oh I don't want anybody cutting
the fat out of my government because the
government is so lean and perfect nobody
it's a really good major major issue and
it defines them
so he's got that going for him
um but I'm going to give you the reframe
that will get him elected president
unless Trump is
you ready now
I I know I may have mentioned I have a
best-selling book almost it's best
selling in this categories about
reframing how to take an ordinary
situation and change it so that the
world and you act differently
I'm going to give a reframe to Vivek
that will guarantee that he beats
everybody
um well except DeSantis I'm going to say
this guarantees he's in the top two not
counting Trump
who would Steve Jobs hire
of of the people who were on the stage
who would Steve Jobs hire
Steve Jobs said not recently but on a
video that's going around he said that
his main hiring decision Steve Jobs
primary decision-making thing
is he gets the best person he could
whose best days are ahead of them
and we're done
there were two candidates whose best
days might be ahead of them DeSantis
and Vivek
Vivek really stands out as the one that
Steve Jobs would have obviously hired
right there's no doubt about it he would
have obviously hired Vivek because he
just has more horsepower in the the
brain area and he's you know much
earlier in his development even than
DeSantis so clearly his best days are
out of him or could be in this domain
now DeSantis is a youngish politician he
may have maxed out as governor
but maybe not so his his best days could
be ahead of him but if I had if I had to
hire one of them for my actual company
it would be Vivek 100 out of 100 times
and I'm pretty sure every one of you
would do the same thing you know if you
were if you'd listen to Steve Jobs
now here's another reframe
the presidency should not be your
retirement job
you see what I'm doing right now on this
live stream this is actually my
retirement job
it's the one I do because I enjoy it
it's not hard for me you know when I'm
when I'm preparing for this and even
when I'm doing it like now I just enjoy
it I actually enjoy the preparation I
enjoy the doing of it and it you know
pays less than what I was doing before I
mean didn't have an option for that but
that's a different story and so this is
I actually think of this this is
actually the way I think of it in my own
mind that this is my retirement job
so even though I still do the comic I do
it the way I want to now not not
beholden to the sensors and that's my
retirement job if you told me you could
retire and draw draw the comic exactly
the way you want to every time nobody's
going to tell you to change it that's my
retirement job
yeah that's not the hard one that's the
easy one so you don't want if you looked
at the stage you looked at you know one
young person
you know who wants to go make a
difference and then a bunch of other
people who look like
they're just looking for something to do
next that isn't that hard now the
presidency is hard but hard in such a
good way that everybody wants a job
all right
um we talk about some others now let's
do DeSantis next
um
found him boring and uninteresting to
the point where at some point about
halfway through the debate I forgot that
he was there
I forgot
and then he started talking like oh yeah
you're still here
there's something forgettable about him
his personality does not work for this
kind of venue in other words he's not
the guy who's going to bring the
artificial enthusiasm and sell it to you
he's not the guy whose energy is
external he seems like he has like
strong internal energy
you know maybe more of an introvert
actually he might be an introvert who's
just over performing but you know maybe
he just likes his alone time and stuff
uh you can tell the Vivek you know likes
he likes he likes the the external world
like he's he's of the external world
here's my question to you
if if Trump becomes uh next candidate or
next president
is that going to be pleasant for
republicans
basically you get turned into Hitler you
get turned into a fascist
and they go nuts
fifty percent of the world will have TDS
so here's the real question
is that a reason not to vote for Trump
will should you say they shouldn't feel
that way and if they do I don't care
or do you say that's actually part of
the decision
that one of the big variables is that he
makes other people crazy
so here's the thing if DeSantis were
president instead
would the left go as crazy
they were definitely accuse him of being
Hitler for his policies but would they
accuse him of a big Hitler because of
his personality
and I think probably no
probably no I mean he comes off as a
sort of a you know a corporate guy you
know only in this presentation not not
his philosophies but he comes off as
sort of a
generic just executive
does that scare people on the left
you know because his policies would be
things they don't want well it does but
does anything scare you the way Trump
does
you know Trump's the you know times 10
scare you're a normal Republican scare
gets you a George Bush
I would say DeSantis is scary like
either of the bushes
before they were elected
right sort of a generic Republican scary
but a generic scary Republican can get
elected
so I have a real question in my mind if
you ask me could DeSantis uh execute
right is he good at just getting the
thing done whatever the thing is he's
trying to do and the answer is maybe one
of the best we've seen
I mean it's hard to tell from the
outside because you're only seeing what
people want you to say but it looks to
me
like he's really effective now does that
mean he's more effective than a if a
fake would be I don't know I don't think
any of us could know that
but I would say for sure that nobody's
really experienced that being a
president
so if you say that Vivek is not
experienced I would first of all go to
the Steve Jobs quote you hire the people
whose best days are ahead of them and uh
I would also say that nobody's
experienced when they first become
president if you want experience this
you know Trump or Biden and they come
with a lot of baggage
experience gives you a lot of baggage
and you got to deal with that so ask
yourself how much of that experience you
want to deal with
it's not all good
all right
um
to me here's another way to look at it
I will take the smartest person in the
room with the clearest positive message
and is age 38 without even knowing
anything else about the candidate if you
didn't know there was a Vivek and they
said all right all right here's a
proposition I'm going to bring you
somebody who's smarter than all the
people in the room
he has the clearest positive view of the
world
clear positive View and he's age 38.
where she is
I'll take that every time
I will take that every time do I need
his experience do you know how long it
would take of a vague to learn a new
thing
come on are you paying attention
let me just ask the question again
because it's almost funny
do you understand how long it takes
of Vivek I'll use him as like a generic
of a vague do you know how long it takes
him to learn a new complicated thing
like regular people that's why he's
doing so well he's doing so well that he
could because he can walk into any
complicated situation from economics to
law to Medicine
and science he's actually you know quite
proficient in in the most complicated
domains do you think he can't figure out
the presidency
the presidency is being done by well
kind of by Joe Biden
I've got a feeling that the presidency
would be one of the easiest things he
ever figured out
all right
um he did wake one I think it was sort
of a mistake he when he started he goes
you know I know what you're thinking who
is this skinny guy so it was sort of
reminiscent of something Obama said when
he was introduced to the world and it's
something that uh who is that Admiral
Stockwell
do you remember
he started out the Stockdale Stockdale
uh he started out his debate by saying
all right who am I and why am I here
and everybody's just laughed because he
defined himself as not belonging there
was like one of the greatest mistakes in
debate history so Vivek came kind of
close with his you know who you know I
know what you're thinking who's the
skinny guy
I think the way I would have gone is if
this is the first time you've seen me
you're probably wondering why I'm
already polling number two
right
compare mine who's the skinny guy blah
blah blah the joke didn't land
better
if you've never heard of me and you've
never seen me before you're probably
wondering why I'm already polling number
two by the end of the debate I hope
that's obvious
boom
cluster bomb
all right let's talk about some of the
others ASA Hutchinson who I call the
poor man's Mike Pence you do not want to
look like a bad version of the guy who
is a vice president
never works never works
um
I talked about a few of them how about
this bergam guy
bergam did one of the worst things I've
ever seen
he introduced himself to the country by
saying he was the only one there from a
town of 300 people
that's that's my first impression of him
and the only thing I remember
and the only thing I remember is oh he
didn't have anything to sell himself
he came empty he was unprepared
he had one leg because he hurt his leg
before the the thing he that was nothing
uh Christy
um he's he's sort of a sideshow
character
like I don't take him seriously because
I don't think he's serious about running
I I don't know why he's running I assume
there's some billionaire behind him who
has some objective that may not be
winning an election I just don't know
what's going on
but Christy came with his uh prepared uh
oh I'm gonna get the vague and here was
his here was his I gotcha making it look
like it was you know off the cuff but
very much not off the cuff he talks
about Vivek he goes I've had enough of a
guy who sounds like chat GPT
now let's do a survey of Republican
voters who were watching the debate on
Fox News
Republican voters watching the debate
on Fox News
average age
do I have to finish
how many of the how much how many people
in the audience know what chat GPT is
every one of you do like a hundred
percent of you do but as soon as you
leave the people who are you know
following the top two percent of all the
news
how many people even know who pregosian
is we'll talk about him in a minute how
many people
right the general population is Nothing
Like Us
meaning people who are kind of addicted
to following this stuff
that was a terrible mistake do you know
what it sounded like to me
to my ears and this is not what he said
this is not what Christie said but to my
ears
I heard him making fun of him working at
a 7-Eleven
or doing tech support
that's what I heard now he didn't say
that
or anything like it but if you don't
know what chat GPT is do you think it's
something about tech support
do you I bet you do
and it looks like he was just mocking
you for his ethnicity
that's what it looked like now that
that's not what happened that did not
happen in the real world it did not
happen but the way it felt
it was just so awkward that that was
just a fail
and then uh but Vivek ended up with the
both the best comeback which did look
spontaneous I don't know if it was he
may be prepared with this already but he
sold it like it was spontaneous and that
was that uh you know Christy was saying
that Trump is running for vengeance and
uh what'd he say
Vengeance and grievance
says your point would be a lot stronger
if you were not running for president
solely for vengeance and grievance
against one person
oh we're done here
oh hello Hello Goodbye Chris Christie
that's the end of that
you just talk about now Crystal's still
hanging around because he's not a real I
don't think he's a real candidate he's a
stunts a candidate or a special feature
candidate or I mean he's not going to be
president
um let's see
how many of you remember that Tim Scott
was at the debate
this morning I decided to see to make my
notes to talk about it I thought I'd
make my notes based on what I remembered
because what you remember is actually
the important part the parts you didn't
remember don't have a persuasive element
to them because you literally don't
remember them I could not remember that
Tim Scott was on the stage
literally I didn't I thought I'd done
all my notes oh this guy this guy this
this woman and then I looked on a
picture and go oh shoot
Tim Scott was there too
he disappears on stage
when you put him on the stage with all
the other people he just disappeared and
which is weird because I always thought
he was pretty solid
he's solid in the sense he says you know
good solid Republican sounding things
he's got a good backstory he's
successful individually seems like a
good guy doesn't have any I don't know
of any scandals per se
so I'm going to use a good solid vice
president looking guy but he didn't help
himself he looked like he just
disappeared
too polite
all right let's talk about Trump uh on
Tucker he the number of views on
Tucker's show on X is probably going to
hit 200 million
let me just say that again
in case you weren't following along
a typical Prime Time show
on Fox News gets how many viewers now
this was more than a prime time show but
how many Fox News viewers do you get
typical night
3 million yeah 3 million would be a
runaway hit
3 million
he's already at 192 million
three
192.
now the debate itself was probably I'm
sure more than three does anybody have a
number on Fox News viewership
I'm
23 million
that can't be right
my in my bed
but whatever that number is is nowhere
near 200 million
I think we agree 200 million is more is
way more than the number of Voters right
that's way more than the number of
people who vote
so I don't know maybe the viewer numbers
are people who dipped in and dipped out
do you get counted twice if you watch
half and then you come back for the
other half
oh I think you do right no no it just
looks at your IP if you come from a
different IP is it twice
it would be twice if you came from a
different computer yeah so I don't think
that number is as real as the viewership
numbers so it's probably not an apple
and an orange but it's a gigantic number
and as other observers said
um Tucker approved the model
Elon Musk proved the model
uh
yeah people really really want to watch
this kind of content
on X so gigantic victory for musk
gigantic victory for Tucker
um good for them and I'm sure Fox News
had a good night actually so it was
probably a good night for them
but anyway Trump talked to Tucker uh
here are my observations number one
visually uh Trump I don't know if it was
the lighting or Trump has decided to go
with a white hair look does anybody know
the answer to that was that just
lighting
or did he actually
improve his his color coordination in
the head area because you look great
I I thought I thought he looked better
than well really anytime I think he
looked at better than 2016. frankly
so that's that's pretty good you know if
you could pull that off
um he did look like he was completely in
his right senses he uh
you know I thought he was he was
interesting but
correct me if I'm wrong the debate was
so missing Trump that you could almost
taste it
when you were watching it it felt like
you were watching the the band that
showed up instead of the one you were
hoping for
that the that the total wattage of the
event even with Vivek was so obviously
below what it would have been if Trump
had been there now he made exactly the
right decision to not be there because
he would have been you know average with
them and he could have made a mistake
accidentally or been quoted in a context
so the best thing he could do is lay low
and he did but well if you could call
that laying low he was just in a
different venue so here are some of the
highlights
number two number one uh Tucker asked
him if he thinks Epstein killed himself
and and Trump actually gave this long
indirect answer where he said he didn't
know
but that
um he thinks he you know might have
committed suicide but he he thought that
Tucker and others might think
differently so he was actually giving
you know full balance to both views
which is actually a perfect president
answer
because if there's somebody on the other
side and it's an issue of no importance
to the country whatsoever I mean not
really uh he's Daddy's dead doesn't
matter who did it
um then the best answer is don't cause
any trouble
now the fact that he pulled that off
without showing you know what he really
thought
was actually a good performance and I'm
going to call it a performance because
do you think that he doesn't know
you think that Trump doesn't know what
happened
now doesn't mean he was a witness but
you don't think he knows
I think all the presidents know
I think they know
all right I don't know what the answer
is but I think they know
um you have to listen to
uh well you have to listen to uh Trump's
clip of him talking about Joe Biden's
physicality
all right so I can't I can't reproduce
it because it's classic Trump and he
just starts pecking at Biden and I'll
just give you some of the parts and it
won't be funny when I tell you it'll
just give you a flavor but he talks
about uh how Joe Biden can't walk
through the grass on the way to the
helicopter because the grass is Too Tall
because two inches can't do it
out he is so visual you imagine Biden
not being able to walk to the
helicopters that's the first image he
puts in your head then he goes to the
beach
he goes he's in the beach he can't walk
through the sand I mean sand is hard to
walk through but but he can't even do it
the the beach chair he couldn't pick up
a beach chair do you know how how heavy
a beach chair is they're made to be
super light super light he couldn't even
pick it up uh he doesn't look good why
why did they let him why do they why is
he let people take pictures of him at
the beach it's not a good look
and he said his his legs look like
toothpicks and he just keeps going on so
here's what happened
I happened to be playing it as I was you
know brushing my teeth getting ready for
bed
about halfway through
I was laugh crying to the point of an
asthma attack
I was doubled over tears were shooting
out of my eyes I was holding my stomach
and I thought I was going to die
now
who made you feel that way in the debate
nobody
nobody
the the level of emotional
connection that Trump creates
you know through the television from
miles away even recorded you know
recorded
is it's unprecedented and nobody will
ever come close I don't believe anybody
will ever come close to the pure wattage
of his personality because he he made
the debate look like it was just missing
him
and then when he talks he draws these
movies in your head that you feel like
you watched a comedy movie with with a
funny narrator and I was just crying it
was so funny now it was so funny because
it was so mean
right you're not supposed to be so mean
when you're running for a president so
the fact that and by the way this is a
humor trick one of the basic tricks of
humor is to you take somebody who's not
supposed to act a certain way and then
you have them act that way
for example I if I created a doctor
character for the comic stripe I would
have the doctor not be like regular
doctor he would actually want to kill
people and hate people
or uh bunny rabbit would be like a
vicious killer right and so anytime
something is the opposite of what it's
supposed to be it's just naturally funny
so when Trump who is supposed to be you
know the politically correct leader who
brings us all together he starts mocking
the physical abilities of his competitor
and how he's already gone mentally Etc
is not supposed to happen
so is that it's the difference between
what you you should be seeing and what
you're actually experiencing is what
causes the laugh reflex because your
brain can't put them together it's like
I know it's Trump but still you're not
supposed to be doing this then you just
start laughing now I'm completely aware
that the way he strikes me is very
different than how he strikes Democrats
of course and and also a lot of
Republicans and I'm convinced that the
main reason there's a difference is
some people know that he's joking
and others don't in other words some
people such as me and most of you I
think you know that when he's doing that
when he's doing the Biden stuff and
other stuff as well that he's playing a
part he's creating a character he's
putting on a show
and he's drawing all the energy to him
making you laugh because if you can
laugh with somebody you're gonna like
them am I right if you laugh with
somebody
it's hard to not like them
it's just impossible so he makes people
laugh and then it's you just want to see
more of it your dopamine gets spiked and
you say you know what the only way I'm
going to get more of this dopamine like
the Laugh that I had last night I would
have paid for
if you said all right to get that laugh
uh it's a hundred dollars yep a hundred
dollars I would pay a hundred dollars to
feel how I felt last night for 15
minutes a hundred dollars
it was that good
now who gives you that
everybody else is just a oh I like his
policy where I like what she said about
abortion
you don't feel anything
nothing
all right
um I thought Pence was just Pence and uh
by the way Pence is a real good
um performer
so pens had a solid debate he was the
number one in time but that had to do
with people who were mentioning him so
we got a little more time but he was
smart enough he was so good that the at
the beginning of the debate I think
there was some reference to the Trump
Administration and he immediately tried
to interrupt and say well I've been
mentioned
because the rules are if you get
mentioned you get you get some response
time so he actually tried to get time
based on the fact that the question or
somebody said something about the
administration and that was that was
really that was a stretch but the fact
that he he took a he took a play at it
just showed how good he is because that
that was a pretty good play didn't work
didn't work but it was a good play I
like I liked his
quick judgment and his experience on
that that was that was well well
executed didn't work
um so I think he's a good debater got
the most time who got the number two
time
the fake
and he got it by earning it
right because the other people wanted to
talk about him they were talking about
Vivek more than they were talking about
DeSantis that's one of the things people
are chatting about today if you could be
number two on the stage and have more
people attack you than the person who's
effectively number one
watch out
and that's that's pretty predictive of
his rise
all right uh here are two fake newses
one in each Direction meaning a
conservative one and then a a Democrat
one
now you are not going to agree with me
on either of these can we can we
stipulate that
you're going to go whoa Scott you lost
me on that one because that's true for
sure
Maybe
but in my opinion
there are two things that look fake
number one when CNN talks about Vivek
wanting to abolish the FBI they do not
include the most important fact
that he doesn't want to get rid of their
function
he wants to distribute the people who do
real work to places where their work is
more directed in a specific
type of crime
and then get rid of the administrative
stuff now how do you turn a great idea
or potentially great idea into the worst
sounding thing in the world you just say
he wants to abolish the FBI
and then you talk a little bit about the
history of the FBI and how awesome it's
been that's what CNN did
they just talked about how awesome the
FBI is and it's been there forever and
if you leave out that he wants to keep
the functions
you're just lying would you agree would
you agree it's a lie
just a complete lie if you don't say he
wants to keep the functions now
here's my one criticism of Vivek
he needs to say that in every sentence I
want to I want to get rid of the FBI but
keep the functions and get rid of the
fat you know distribute it if he said
that every time everybody would just
agree
I mean you would just get people saying
Oh okay that's that's reasonable now I
don't think that's necessary he does say
that with the Department of Education
when he talks about the Department of
Education he says ban it and take the
money from that and give it to the
states and then I say oh oh okay that's
not just Banning something because you
don't like it
that's making sure that the problem is
more directly you know closer to the
people they can spend it et cetera
so that's the first one so that that's a
fake news that the left is doing on
Vivek here's one you're not going to
like Jen saki said no one supports
abortion up until birth
because I think maybe all of the people
on the stage or most of them believe
yeah here it comes hold on though hold
on I I might surprise you on this
might surprise you the number one thing
I remind you of is I I don't have an
opinion on trying to sell you on
abortion I don't have one I also don't
know
what's going on with this claim so so
that's the the big point is that I'm not
sure what's true so don't assume I know
it's true
and don't assume you're seeing my
opinion I'm just going to talk about the
as a news bit
so gem saki said no one sports abortion
until birth I saw a bunch of other
tweeters say the same thing whereas the
Republicans are quite unified I think
and believing it's absolutely a thing
uh let me get a feed I'm sure I know how
this is going to turn out but would you
say this statement is true
no one supports abortion until birth
meaning Democrats
do you believe that's true
that no one supports abortion up until
birth
it just feels like a lie doesn't it
so it feels like a lie to me
but what's true
so I thought well I seem to be badly
under-informed on this topic
specifically because I'm just going to
follow the lead of women
if women want a certain set of laws
that's the most credible outcome to me
so I'm not going to bother with my
opinion on this stuff
but here's so I so here's what I did I
went to Google and I said I'm going to
Google and find out if this is true or
false that there is such a thing as
abortion until birth and that it really
exists and that gen sake is just lying
about it as are the other Democrats
because that's what you believe right
you believe it's totally a thing in a
number of states maybe not everywhere
but you believe it's totally a thing in
a number of states and that gen saki is
lying correct
most of you believe that if you're
leading right
so I I Googled it
I Googled it on your behalf
to find out if she's lying
you know what I found out
nothing
nothing
the internet has scrubbed information on
this question
all it is is people talking about it but
there's no fact check
that's right there's no fact check I
couldn't find it see if you can find it
so as of right now I don't know
I do not know what is true and you can't
find it on the internet and that's not a
coincidence
do you think the internet would get rid
of that like by accident you know
there's no fact check on it if you do a
fact Jack on that shouldn't like the
fact check be toward the top and it'd be
obvious now it was all these sources
that are completely
biased and wouldn't have any value at
all
that was my experience if somebody can
find a source
that is both credible and clear
could you tweet it at me because I
actually just don't know it's true I
don't have any idea what's true I'll
tell you my hypothesis
my hypothesis is that it's technically
true in some states
but that there is more to the story
and the more of the story could be for
example if you had an extreme situation
let's say the baby would be born alive
but without a functioning brain
or born alive and would certainly die in
five minutes no matter what but
the mother's life is at Danger
under the most rare extreme situation
would you want the mother to say you
know actually I'm going to save myself
it's my choice
or where do you want the mother not to
have the choice and that the state says
no this baby under any condition every
condition still gets to be born alive
now my guess is
that is that probably what's happening
is something like there's some extreme
situation
now it might also be that they're
playing with the definition of a normal
birth
for example could it be that it's legal
to have the baby just before it's born
if you're having uh some kind of a wrong
early birth and the baby is not viable
or as viable or something so could there
be some extreme situations that they
don't mention where yeah technically
technically it would be legal under the
extreme
which would be totally unacceptable to
the pro-life people would you agree it
wouldn't matter if it's extreme to the
pro-lifes would the pro-life say that
the that the the law should allow the
mother to die
so that the baby can live even if it's
not viable
how many would you agree with that how
many would agree that the mother should
sacrifice herself and that the state
should make her die
so that a non-viable baby can be born
non-viable beating you know it's got
such major problems it's not going to
have a like a regular life
yeah yeah see we don't we don't agree on
even basic stuff
which is part of the reason I try to
stay keep my opinion out of it
um but I'm trying to highlight the fact
that if you can never agree on this
stuff
the best you can do is make sure that
the people who have the most skin in the
game women have a little more dominance
say in the outcome than the people who
have less skin in the game that's the
best you can do that if you want
credibility make sure the skin and the
game people are the people making the
decisions speaking of which I always use
this example
if women wanted to you know vote on a
law about male circumcision
I would not want them to get involved at
all
I'd say I got a skin in the game
how about how about I decide that for
the future man
you know how about men figure this out
and you just keep at it that's what I'd
say
now if only men gave birth
and women could not give birth do you
think I would listen to a woman's
opinion
about what I should do legally or
personally absolutely not in fact I'd be
offended I'd be offended if a woman even
offered her opinion so why wouldn't it
be the same the other way
all right if you were the ones having
babies do you want to hear an opinion
from somebody who doesn't have babies or
never had or can't
yeah it's not a perfect opinion I just
prefer not to muddy the waters with my
less than useful opinion on that
because I'm not going to have any babies
all right
um let's talk about pregosian
everybody here that pagosian
well he's allegedly he allegedly was on
his plane with the other founders of
Wagner
and that it apparently got shot down by
the Russian military
now
there are several possibilities one
possibility is that the plan was for
pagosian to live his retirement in
Belarus he just hadn't gotten there yet
but there was a mechanical problem on
the plane and well talk about bad luck
it went through a whole War without
getting injured and just flying in a in
a plane took him down bad luck oh that's
one possibility let's say that's the
least likely possibility next likely
possibility he was on the plane
and the whole plan was to kill him so it
didn't look as much like he was just
murdered
maybe maybe
the other possibility is he's been dead
for a long time
but they don't want to say that because
the Wagner people and other people might
get mad so they have to create a fake a
fake progression
put hit put his name on the passenger
list apparently they found his cell
phone but not his body that was today's
news who knows it was real but it would
be pretty easy to put his phone on there
put his name on it shoot it down and say
oh yeah he was fine we were best friends
until some tragic thing happened with
the mechanical part of his plane
Maybe
the other possibility is that pagosian
is not dead
and that from the start he has been
interrogated and uh you know there may
be future information he's willing to
give up and he's still an asset for
figuring out who the other coup plotters
were or for leverage on somebody but if
you're going to keep him forever as a
prisoner
that's not cool if a lot of people still
support him
so you're going to have to pretend he's
dead to keep him as a prisoner so you
can interrogate him forever
which of those possibilities do you
think is most likely as of today
do you think he was on the plane
the one thing that we can be sure of
may I summarize his condition without
knowing any of the other particulars so
without knowing where he was or what's
happened to him I'd like to summarize
pagosian's condition
he's not doing well
that's it yeah he's not doing well
that we can say for sure
so the whole Belarus situation now nope
nope nope nope now may I ask this
question
who had the first and best take on
pagosian in the entire world I'll just
sit down and read your comments
it was you
it was me
so
I don't know why there weren't more
people at least in in the public there
were a lot a lot of individuals I see a
lot of you were on the same page so
individually a lot of citizens knew
exactly what was happening from the
start
but uh I feel like the I feel like the
public news was just acting stupid or
something
didn't they all know exactly that from
the very beginning
he he was either already dead or was
never going to be seen again there was
never any chance he was going to go to
Belarus if you ever believed the Belarus
story even after his plane went there
you already watched Russia fake one
pagosian plane trip
you think they wouldn't do it again
now
allegedly Putin likes to kill his
critics allegedly
all right so I have one viewer who wants
me to say allegedly
but if it's true that he's been
poisoning his critics do you see a
pattern
if it's true he poisoned his critics
then it would suggest that there's a
certain way he likes to kill people and
it would have the following
characteristics number one they would
know he's murdering them for a long time
before they died
right because the poison they they it
takes a while
so you know you're dying and you know
exactly who did it
and the entire world knows exactly who
did it but you can't really do anything
about it so it's almost as if he wants
not only the victim to know it I'm
killing you now it's going to take a
while but I'm murdering you it's me hey
it's me I'm killing you
and he wants everybody who is another
critic to know that they could get
poisoned in the same way
right so he sending your message
with this weirdly obvious play that you
know this polonium that only the Russia
seems to have but he wants everybody to
know while still saying what I don't
know what you talk about there's no
evidence connecting it to me
now look at the plane situation
progressions playing
did you notice that from the videos
there was some problem with it looks
like maybe a missile or something but it
fell from a very long distance for a
long time presumably while everybody was
still alive on the inside
so all the way down they had to know
that Putin was killing them
he was doing it in a very public way
and everybody would know he did it and
he would still have some out to say well
I don't know must have been some
mechanical problem
right so
Putin if he's the murderer that
our people say yes he has a way of doing
it that's exactly this
make sure the people getting killed know
they're being murdered so they can
really let it sink in before they
actually die
make sure there's deniability but such
weak deniability that everybody knows he
did it
do you remember when people said that
Putin is weak because the Wagner revolt
that's what they said they said he's
weak
what do you think today
does he feel weak today
no he feels like somebody who just wiped
out the entire Wagner leadership
and made the story about progression so
you don't think so much about the
leadership that he took out
I think it was a strong play
I think it makes him look strong
and you know there's there's a lot of
chatter I don't know if you're hearing
it that Ukraine is is ready to fold
do you believe that's true
remember everything out of that area is
 and bias and lies and
propaganda there's no way to know but
the the idea is that the ukrainians are
like running out of soldiers
but we've also heard that about the
Russians
that they're running out of soldiers but
it doesn't appear that the Russians are
running out of soldiers it doesn't
appear that there's any major internal
strife it doesn't appear that their
economy is going to crash soon I mean
they have some problems with getting
high-tech stuff in the long run but
they'll probably figure out some work
around for that
and they still have cash
so at the moment
it looks like Russia can grind on
Ukraine as long as it wants and it wants
to do it until they're done
so what's going to happen
I still think that a republican could
end the war in a day but we'll see
all right
ladies and gentlemen is there any topic
that I've forgotten I think we've gone
long enough I think it's the best show
you've ever seen if you get a chance to
pick up my incredible Change the World
book reframe your brain people are
buying many copies of it and uh it's
doing great my my conversation with
