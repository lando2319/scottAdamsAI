a little more caffeine
you can feel it already your day is
improving
you are now one with all the zippers
around the globe simultaneously sipped
with you
and I would like to offer this this
following offer to all simultaneous
sippers
have you ever heard of people who went

treat them nice introduce them to your
sister because I'm sure you'd want your
sister to
marry simultaneous sipper I mean duh who
wouldn't
so uh let's let's turn this into
something okay
let's turn it into something where if
you get a request from the simultaneous
sipper you take it seriously because
that's somebody
who's got it going on
all right let's talk about some things
I have two entertainment related
recommendations which I know you love
because who doesn't want to know what I
think is entertaining so that that can
inform you
everybody everybody cares what I find
entertaining don't they
I hope I'm not wrong about that
well all right I have sampled for you
two pieces of content both from Netflix
one is comedy stand up by comedian Neil
Brennan
recommended Neil Brennan
the the magical part of it
is a uh identifies strongly as a
Democrat left-leaning kind of a guy
but he goes right at his own people
so he he's explaining the difficulty of
being a lefty in a world where sometimes
you're not left enough
so he's continually frightened about
whether whether he's liberal enough
because he's being judged by his own
people you have to see it right I can't
you can't possibly explain it in a way
that makes it sound effective I would
just tell you
that you would love it whether you're
left leading or right leading just
because he does it really well he's just
really good at it I wish I had known him
before I guess he's been around a while
um
the second piece of content do you
remember the old Adams Family TV show
they spelled it with two D's but it was
the bane of my existence because I was a
child when The Adams Family was
a big TV show
do you think anybody ever
accused me of being Uncle Festus or
Fester or whoever he was oh yeah they
did oh yeah yeah I heard I heard a few
Gomez references
um however there's a new show called
Wednesday Adams and Wednesday is the the
young daughter
and I'll give you some good things about
it
and then I'll tell you why you should
not watch it whatsoever but you'll
probably will anyway because there's not
much on
one reason to watch it is that the young
actress who plays the part really good
they the casting was really good
great job and I love the look of it in
the feel of it and the vibe of it it's
all really well done
but here's why you probably should never
watch this piece of
it's just it's anti-male porn
it's about a young girl who does
horrible things to adult white men
and that's the whole show
the in the in the first scene and she
has the balls ripped off a man for you
know being part of some men who
threatened her she has his balls ripped
off and that's like a joke
that he got his nuts chewed off by some
fish that she put in there
that actually is played for laughs the
how much she can destroy the lives of
white Bales who by the way in the movie
all have it coming right so they're all
terrible people these white men
the the whole show is just anti-white
male porn and I would watch it as porn
if I were a woman who hated men so if
you ate man it's a really good show
so
yeah and if you want to see if you want
to see how Hollywood is completely
destroying itself it's worth watching it
for that
because I don't see how they can survive
really
I mean what other group
imagine if you just changed the genders
you know this is the old I hate doing
this but it kind of screams for in this
case imagine there were a movie it was
just completely straight movie
somebody just made a movie in which
there was a young man
who crippled and
decapitated just adult women
and then the whole movie was how the
women were horrible Karens but she she
killed them all or um the the young man
killed them all that wouldn't be on TV
would it
would never be on TV
but as long as it's a young woman
destroying the lives of men who totally
deserve it according to the movie
fine no problem
all right well Hollywood is dead
um
so I updated the hoax quiz used to be 16
elements now it's up to 17. and the new
the new hoax is that Trump invited
uh Nick Fuentes and Myla
the the truth seems to be and axios
reports this was not just Trump saying
it the truth seems to be that he didn't
didn't know Fuentes was coming
now that doesn't mean that Trump is in
the clear right I'm not giving him a
pass I'm just saying that it's a hoax
that he invited him and that's you know
what uh the the Rob reiners are saying
today how could you invite him well he
didn't it was a trick
uh but Trump made a statement
and I think this uh Trump's statement
um fixed everything
uh because you know how Trump is good at
smoothing things over you know you take
a provocative situation and you can
count on Trump to say something that'll
just completely take the energy out of
it and and make you not care about it
anymore
so here's the beginning of his statement
he said quote so I help a seriously
troubled man who just happens to be
black
yay Kanye West who has been who has been
decimated in his business and virtually
everything else who has always been good
to me by allowing his request for a
meeting at Mar-A-Lago alone and then he
goes on to say some other stuff
so
uh
do you think Grandpa Trump
could have sounded any more like your
racist Grandpa
a man who just happens to be black
was there somebody out there who didn't
know that Kanye was black
holy are you telling me yay is
black
that changes everything
yeah you know you always you always joke
people always joke when people say I
have a black friend
you know say oh great you have one black
friend you racist
and Trump does the most grandfatherly uh
sounding thing oh I I was helping this
guy who just who just happens to be
black
like I'm not saying I'm not racist but I
helped a guy who just happens to be
black it just happens to be black
I don't think you could have said that
any worse
yeah I'm black too I
just happened to not look at them
I identified that way though
so
um I'm not sure that made anything
better
laughs
but of course the the way the Democrats
are playing it is they're playing it
hard you know Republicans would have
done the same thing if if some democrat
did something awkward
um and so now the play is to see if you
can make the Republicans uh disavow
that dinner with Trump
and if they don't disavow it quickly
enough and you know aggressively enough
then they're racist too
so now because DeSantis has not
disavowed it strongly enough or I don't
think he's commented then he must be
part of it
and then McCarthy hasn't said anything
about
Marjorie Taylor green who once uh
attended some Nick Fuentes event and
spoke at it
so that that's the game is to make
everybody respond now eventually those
people will have to respond won't they
because the journalists will just Peck
them to death until they say something
and then once they respond what will
they what will the journalist say
well
not until we force them to respond so
that was a pretty weak response so so
basically they'd just get another bite
of the Apple no matter what these guys
say
um so that's the play and it's a good
play politically politically it's pretty
powerful
um
so I thought the best comment about this
came from Ben Shapiro
who said of trump the best way to make
sure you don't accidentally have a uh
anti-semite attend your dinner
is to not invite somebody that you
already know is an anti-semite
now
it's not my claim necessarily that yay
is an anti-semite but clearly he said
things which Jewish people say nope
that's anti-Semitic so uh you know Ben
benkin play that team he's he's got all
the credentials he needs
that wasn't a bad comment if you invite
somebody who's already nationally
accused of being anti-semitic you can't
be too surprised if he brings a friend
I think he nailed it all right now
here's here's the layout
you know Fox News is trying to freeze
Trump out by not talking about him right
so Fox News is not going to back him
um which means you know other Rupert
Murdoch properties probably won't back
up you know that Breitbart went hard
at this situation so Breitbart seems
anti-trump
and now the daily wire if we can judge
from Ben Shapiro's point
so are those the three biggest
conservative news outlets
who's left
I would say they are the most
influential
and also the biggest
how in the world would Trump win without
Fox News
without Breitbart
and without the daily wire
like how how does he win
we shall see we shall see yeah now
remember my idea that Trump instead of
doing a normal campaign
he should just create his own podcast
and then he should ask ask people to be
on it so instead of being the gas
station you should be interviewing the
guests
imagine imagine Trump
hosting his own podcast
and inviting yay
and Fuentes to be on
after Trump knows that they screwed him
after Trump knows that he screwed him
invite him on to explain themselves
would you watch that
how would you watch anything else
are you kidding me
because do you think Trump is happy
about either of those guys
if there's one thing that Trump doesn't
like
it's somebody who pretends to be his
friend and then stabs him in the back in
public which is what he aided yeast
abdomen the back
how much do you think
how much do you think Trump
thinks of yay when when Trump has been
Pro yay from the beginning and yay just
stabs him in the back
I would love
to see that interview I think Trump
would just rip his head off you
know verbally
and you know and yay wouldn't back down
what would happen I mean it would be the
most interesting thing I'd ever seen in
my life
so I don't know that Trump can become
president under this cloud and other
clouds but he could have the best
podcast anybody ever had
it would be the biggest thing ever
am I right does anybody disagree with me
that if you started a podcast where he
interviews the most provocative people
you would have to watch it you couldn't
you couldn't not watch it
yeah he could fund his entire campaign
with a pay-per-view
oh my God pay-per-view
pay-per-view
Trump interviews Kanye
and Fuentes at the same time
pay-per-view
I would pay for that
I would totally pay for that
yeah
you say it's a non-story
but you don't get to you don't get to
say that
because the Press decides what's the
story it's not it's not your interest
there are plenty of interesting things
that are not in the news because the
news decided that's not a story for you
so what do you say it's not a story that
means nothing you're not in charge of
making a story there and they made it a
story so it is a story because the
people who make stories say this
all right
um
is it true that McCarthy is considering
Marjorie Taylor green as Speaker of the
House
I'm saying that on social media but that
doesn't sound
true
that's not true is it
I haven't seen a news story on it that
sounds like just something that Dems are
saying to scare the country right yeah
it doesn't sound right
all right
um
how many of you think that yay
and Fuentes set up Trump and that the
the purpose of it was to sabotage Trump
how many of you think that
you don't think it was sabotage
you think that yay
thought that bringing Fuentes to
Mar-A-Lago
would be perfectly
non-controversial
no of course he knew what he was doing
how could he not
yay isn't mentally incompetent like he
he knows how to address himself and he
he knows how the world works and stuff
he's not crazy in that way
he knows how the world works of course
of course it was I don't think there's
any question about that
and if by the way if Trump doesn't
destroy yea for this
then he's not Trump
don't you think I I think Trump is going
to absolutely destroy you I think he's
just going to completely destroy him
do you think so
I think he should
he should if anybody ever had it coming
and you know maybe maybe that's the
fight that yay wants yay might want that
fight maybe that helps him more energy
who knows
so
this will get interesting
but you did not see uh Trump you know
forcefully uh disavow
Fuentes because I assume because there
are too many people who vote for Trump
who like Fuentes
so now that's consistent
Trump does not typically he doesn't
criticize people who support him
now there's some question about whether
Fuentes really supports DeSantis or
Trump
I don't know
I don't know I I think maybe that's an
open question
somebody says who's Fuentes let me
explain him Nick Fuentes is a
hispanic white supremacist
he's a hispanic white his supremacist
it's just a weird thing that you can say
that in public and that everybody's okay
one of those hispanic white supremacists
does that even make sense I think his
father's Mexican descent that's why his
name is Fuentes
but but I wonder how many of his
followers followers even understand
that the whole white supremacy thing you
know is not exactly what you think it is
now I was reading up a little bit of
Fuentes and the funniest thing that he
says
because
here's the main thing I think you have
to treat Fuentes as a an Entertainer
but also a political force
so a little a little bit like Trump in
that sense within the entertainment part
one of the things he says that women
shouldn't have the vote
and he doesn't want women working you
know that it's more like it's more like
you should go back to the old days where
the women stay home and they raise
babies
and he says that out loud and you know
completely without any reservations and
I'm seeing somebody here saying well I
agree
[Laughter]
and I'm saying even uh even Erica is
saying I don't disagree yeah there there
are in fact women who say that women
shouldn't have the vote
I don't think anybody should have the
vote it's not like men are nailing it
yeah if you took a woman out of the vote
do you think you'd get a better result
doubt it you'll get a different result
probably different but would it be
better I don't know who knows
so
um this whole thing worked really really
well for whoever was behind it now
here's the first question I think you
need to answer
how do yay and Fuentes know each other
wouldn't you like to know that story
do you think they just ran into each
other
do you think that yay was just a fan
or vice versa and or or that Milo did it
do you think that
oh you think it was Milo
then do you think Milo was trying to
destroy yay
because could you imagine Milo sort of
wouldn't know how this would turn out
of course he would know of course he
would
both free basins
all right let me uh let me just throw a
little conspiracy theory uh juice into
the mix you like your conspiracy
theories don't you
in 2017 Chuck Schumer said of trump
it's the dumbest thing in the world to
insult the intelligence Community
because they have a thousand ways from
Sunday to get back to you
so Chuck Schumer who definitely knows
how things work behind the curtains said
the intelligence agencies are going to
come for Trump
and then
and then we saw that 50 former and
current Intel people
signed a thing that said that Hunter's
laptop was Russian disinformation
which probably had a big impact on the
election
they came for Trump
no question about it they came for Trump
now
let me ask you this
were you surprised
that those uh let's see the Whitmer
kidnap uh people that there were FBI
informants in that extremist group were
you surprised by that
probably not because they try to
infiltrate any extremist group how about
the proud boys I guess the number one or
maybe the number two people in the proud
boys might have been a FBI informant or
something I forget what the details are
was that surprising
big surprise
you shouldn't be a surprise because
that's exactly who the intelligence
people would want to co-opt right
now how about Nick Fuentes
do you think Nick Fuentes works for
himself
and has no contact whatsoever with the
groups who have a great incentive to
contact him and co-opt him
do you think that the intelligence
agencies would miss this opportunity to
do the most obvious thing that they
routinely do which is to get the top
racist sort of working on their team
if you were if you were the government
and you wanted to find out where all the
racists were in the country how would
you do it
how would you find all the races
well you might find somebody who appeals
to that group of people
and then get close to them and find out
who's on their list
and then once you have the mailing list
and the people who watch Nick Fuentes
the most you have an entire database of
people with a certain
certain philosophy and they're the ones
you want to watch
if you're if you're the government
so you don't think that intelligence and
FBI law enforcement you don't think
they've tried to penetrate the the Nick
Fuentes organization the the gripers
I have no I have no information that
they have right there's no evidence that
has happened but you don't think they
tried
why wouldn't they it's it's literally
what they do for a living
they literally tried to infiltrate
groups exactly like that so they know
what's happening and wouldn't you want
them to
don't you want them to penetrate all
those groups well you don't want them to
you know be inciting violence within
those groups but you'd want them to
penetrate them just to keep an eye on
things just in case in case there's
something going on there that's going to
get dangerous
so what are the odds that yea and
Fuentes met each other organically
somebody somebody says I'm FBI
um what are the odds they met each other
organically
the first thing I would do is I would
ask them because you know there isn't
yay and Fuentes they're both accessible
to the Press are they not
can't you just reach them and ask them a
question then they would answer you
I would ask them how they met
now if it turns out it's Milo that still
doesn't settle the question does it
because you don't know what Milo's up to
but
if you wanted to follow the money and
take the most obvious
straightforward assumption based on
pattern recognition it would look like
this and I'm not saying this is true I'm
saying that all of our experience and
pattern recognition should tell you the
following
that it was not an OP it was an Intel
opt to make sure Trump doesn't get
reelected and the Fuentes may or may not
be aware of it I mean he might be he
might have just gotten an invitation and
thought oh of course I'll go I mean it
doesn't mean he's part of the plotting
but that doesn't happen by accident
it doesn't happen by accident that he
got in there so somebody with a little
weight
was was uh suggesting behind the scenes
there's a little suggesting going on
there
now
how worried are you about the EA plus
Fuentes uh
connection
it's real weird
because because they're both considered
you know I guess anti-semites at this
point
but they're uh
it's a weird it's a weird group to be
called racists and anti-semites
so I mean one's black one's last name is
Fuentes
so it's a weird white supremacist group
isn't
um
now
wouldn't you like to know how they met
that's all just just find somebody on
that list of 50 Intel people who knows
both of them
and maybe you'd find something else all
right
just speculating
meanwhile over in China apparently the
protests in China about the the newest
uh crackdowns are getting pretty
pretty active
so apparently the at least some part of
the Chinese public the young people
are actually chanting
for the overthrow of the government
imagine how Brave you have to be
to be a Chinese citizen
in public
chanting against the government
do you know one reason that they can do
it
just by weird coincidence they have to
wear masks
so China
wants to control them at the same time
they want them to wear masks how do you
just game that out oh we're going to
make you do a very very unpleasant
things for a long time but also you have
to wear a mask so we can't identify you
in public
how did they think that was going to
turn out
like did you have to be some political
expert to know that if you tell
everybody to wear a mask
and then you make then you oppress them
in ways that they couldn't possibly
tolerate
there might be some demonstrations on
the street and they might be wearing
masks they just might be
so the experts and I saw a tweet by uh
oh who was it Baloo
um yes Professor Francois Balu I think
pronounce it correctly
and he's showing that uh
China has two options
and both of them are
paths to Doom
right so they can keep their cat they're
locked down in place
but the lockdown won't ever make their
risk go away
because as long as covet is circulating
around every time they do a lockdown
they just make themselves less immune
and eventually they're going to have to
unlock down and then it just gets them
so so here's the problem
the Chinese success of doing the hard
lockdown initially did look like a
success for a while didn't it as brutal
as it was to their citizens it kind of
looked like it sort of kind of almost
worked
I wasn't quite sure but in my mind and I
think all of you had the same thing
what happens when they stop doing this
like don't you eventually all get
infected and are you really better off
now I thought they had won
because I thought that they had stalled
until Omicron was here and then Omicron
would just act like a practice like like
a vaccination
but I did see some experts saying that
if you didn't have any immunity Omicron
would rip through your billion people or
so and you you're you'd have some so
much massive death
especially because China China has an
older population right but not as much
obesity
um and it looks like their Health Care
System would be overwhelmed fairly
quickly
so China has uh Choice one they keep
with the lockdowns
but the lockdowns can't work and they
also can't end
because as soon as you end one you know
there's gonna be another virus and it
pops right back up again so that would
cause social upheaval and a massive
scale
but if they end the lockdowns they would
admit that their lockdowns were a
failure
and there's some thought that they could
not they could not survive the
government could not survive confessing
that big a failure
so I don't know I kind of disagree
I disagree with the level of risk that
China is experiencing
I think China could have protests all
day long
for months
and just ride it out
because nothing's happening
it's just talk as long as the protesters
are just talking
they'll just you know jail a few play it
out you know maybe wait for winter so
it's too cold
they can just they can just ride it out
as long as they don't care about the you
know the interim damage of the protests
themselves
they can ride it out
and so I don't see anything that looks
like a risk to the government do you
does this look like it's genuinely a
risk to the government because I don't I
don't see it
some of you say yes well I would agree
that things could turn in a minute but
so so far the protesters are not doing
anything that's physically
um aggressive
right
the protester is not taking over
buildings
are they
as long as they stay in the street
they're not burning anything they're not
looting
I know but why does the government have
to listen to them at all just let him
run around and they'll get tired and
then they'll run out of food and and
they'll have to do something else
now this brings us to the protest in
Iran
did you know that for whatever reason I
don't really know why our media isn't
really taking the Iran protests very
seriously
is that my imagination
because if you know anybody who has
Iranian connections as I do
the the word inside of Iran is very
different from what we're hearing inside
Iran it looks like a real Revolution
that might actually topple the
government
and the thinking at least from one smart
person the thinking is that what's
different is that it's the women this
time
and this is sort of like inside inside
Iranian culture so this is not me saying
this
this is someone who knows Iran
and knows the women of Iran and the
thinking is
that you could piss off all the men in
Iran forever and it wouldn't change the
government
but you just pissed off the weapon
and when the women are mad and it looks
like they're not going to back down you
can't really mow down the women
does that work does that work anywhere
does it work anywhere where you could
like mass murder women
and then the men would be okay with that
I don't think so so I feel like the the
pressure in Iran has everything to do
with how far the women want to take it
if the women take it all the way
probably they could
they probably could topple the
government
but
uh it would require getting the men
involved right because there's a there's
a certain amount of violence that's
required
and the women are going to do the
violence at a scale they need the women
to jump the men to jump in to do that
now why is it that our press is sort of
ignoring it
what's up with that
do you know
like it seems to be our press would be
all rah-rah-rah let's overthrow Iran
but the pr the U.S press is basically
quiet about it
right showed a few pictures basically
quiet somebody says the BBC's on it
now I guess the question is maybe if the
United States uh looked like it was
active you know looked like it was
organizing to help the protests that
that would help the regime
because then Iran would look like he had
an enemy from the outside maybe I that
doesn't seem like a good enough reason
not to cover it so I don't really know
why
could it be that it's not that big a
deal
or could it be that our press just
doesn't have good information about Iran
could it be that they want the nuclear
deal
could be I don't know
um
so
I saw a quote by Naval tweet and he said
that uh losing their privilege status on
Twitter is the beginning of the end for
mainstream media
now that thought takes a little
you have to you have to sort of
like bounce that around your head a
little bit before it makes sense like
the first time I read it was like I
don't know
but then you bounce it around a little
bit you're like oh yeah I can say it now
I can see it now which is a typical
Naval
comment like he's a little bit ahead of
where your brain is so it takes you
there
and
I can see that
because the thing that the the public
doesn't understand is how important
Twitter is to journalists
Twitter is really the journalist's
social media wouldn't you say
you know Facebook is the mom social
media you know LinkedIn is the business
person's Instagram is for
narcissists and people who would like
like to be narcissists
and want to be narcissists
but Twitter is basically the uh the news
journalist place and if the journalists
lose their if they lose their rank
within Twitter what will they do
would they become less important
I don't know
I feel like here's what I think here's
my prediction
that the blue check if it goes away and
becomes anything that people can buy
then people will just look at your
follower account instead
and it ends up being the same thing
am I wrong
how many of you look at the follower
account to decide how to interpret the
tweet
I'm not the only one who does that right
I definitely do that yeah
yeah
so I think that I was just speaking for
myself and maybe some of you too
the blue check was only a proxy for the
the follower count
now it wasn't a perfect proxy because
you know sometimes somebody knew would
be building an audience and they're not
there yet but you could tell if it's a
building audience I feel like the the
user account is the only thing that
mattered anyway because that's a that's
a measure of influence
so
am I wrong that we don't need the blue
check the blue check was just saving you
a click
and now I'll just do the click see the
follower account
which makes me wonder
if uh has Twitter ever considered
getting rid of the follower account
imagine that
like it would it would change the
service to me to the point where
I'd be I'd be much less likely to use it
because I'm very incentivized
by anything I can measure
here here's like a a persuasion trick
for you people care more about things
that can be measured
so that's why the things that can be
measured end up being dominant over the
things that are what you're worried
about and they might even be more
important but whatever's measured gets
the most attention
so if you can measure the number of
followers then I'm all in I'm like oh I
can compete
for influence
and I can tell how I'm doing by my
number of followers
so that that's very incentivizing for me
I'm like oh I'm in I like I like I like
a good competition
so every day if I get new followers I
look at it I feel good if I get new
followers I get a little like boost of
dopamine
so I'm I'm like part of the machine now
so the machine is like treating me like
the the chicken that gets a pellet it's
like oh look at the pellets you got
500 new users and I'm like oh pellet
give me another pellet I want another
pellet tomorrow
all right predictions
prediction is that the internet dads
will become the dominant
um
influence in the country
the internet dads and that includes
women who are sort of fulfilling the
role of Being the adult in the room
uh I think it's going to be the internet
dads so
so and part of that is because the
media's influence is being
you know deluded by a lot of things
and the the internet dad types are
adding too much value to be ignored
right
yeah or the stepdads right the
internet's stepdads
uh so that's what I think
so let's talk about Stephen King
um
I don't know if I've ever mentioned but
people who are professional artists
sometimes don't have the best grasp of
business and Science and other domains
but they think they do boy do they think
they do
so Stephen King was giving some uh I
guess a business criticism to Elon Musk
so here's what Stephen King said uh he
started out good he goes I think Elon
and this is in a tweet I think Elon Musk
is a Visionary almost single-handedly
he's changed the way Americans think
about automobiles I have a Tesla and
love it that said he's been a terrible
fit for Twitter he appears to be making
it up as he goes along
and then later I guess you got some
responses to that and later he tweeted
but Twitter ain't cars and Twitter ain't
Rockets
so Stephen King with all of his
analytical writers ability
has decided that uh
Elon Musk
who didn't know anything about electric
cars until he made the biggest electric
car company didn't know anything about
satellites until they launched his
network of satellites didn't know
anything about rocket ships to Mars
until he became the head of engineering
because he couldn't Hire One
didn't know anything about uh neural
links to your brains until he formed
neural link didn't know anything about
digital payments until he was part of
the PayPal team didn't know anything
about building gigantic machines that
bore through the Earth efficiently until
he formed the boring company
Stephen King
do you see a pattern here
you see a pattern
you know that every one of those things
he didn't know how to do until he did
them right
if you could find the pattern the
pattern is he's the guy who knows how to
do the things that other people don't
know how to do because he figures it out
and then he does it
that's who he is the most basic
description of Elon Musk is the guy who
can figure out how to do the thing that
other people couldn't figure out how to
do
that's like his entire brand is doing
the thing that Stephen King hasn't
noticed he's good at
the entire situation is that he can do
that over and over again how many times
does he have to prove it
and and and uh Stephen King hasn't
noticed that Tesla can do some things
also what do all these things have in
common except for
um the boring machine the boring machine
is the exception what do they all have
in common
they all require software
they're all software driven
I'm pretty sure that the reason that
that uh that the uh the Rockets can land
back on Earth without and be reused
isn't that mostly software
it is right for the for the engines to
fire at just the right degree to bring a
Long Tall thing down back on its base
that's got to be all software so the
software is driving the cars uh must
just said they did some huge
self-driving test with their uh
their new trucks the the big trucks for
carrying goods and it worked it's all
software
so if there's somebody I would trust to
fix Twitter which is software
I literally there's nobody or person in
the world you'd be the first person
you'd pick
but Stephen King all right
um Gavin Newsom is reportedly all in for
Biden and we'll wait his turn and will
not run for president
if Biden is
now here's how I interpret that
I think Newsom is playing it smart
which is not surprising he's a smart
politician and there are two things that
are possible
Biden actually does run in which case it
really would be a bad idea to rub
against them because primary you're
you're sitting president's a bad luck
and you'd you know be pissing off some
fundraisers and stuff like that so it
probably wouldn't work for him in the
long run to run against Biden but
what are the odds Biden's really going
to run
versus maybe running a little and
dropping out early
I feel like Newsom wants to make sure
he's as friendly as possible with the
Biden team so he can take them over
don't you think
the number one thing Newsome would want
would be for Biden to drop out on his
own without being primaries and then for
to have his infrastructure just move
over to Gavin because apparently it's a
good infrastructure for fundraising and
stuff like that
so I think that's the right play
but here's the fun part
who really is deciding if Biden's going
to run again for for real I mean he says
he's running but we don't know
do you think it's Biden
right you say it's Jill but I don't
believe it
I don't believe it
I don't believe that the president of
the United States ever really listens to
a wife it doesn't matter who the
president is do you know why
just imagine yourself as president of
the United States
and then your wife wants to give you
some advice
how would you take that
here's how I would take it this might be
just revealing a personality defect on
my part
I would see the lips move blah blah blah
but then my brain would be saying
one of us and only one of us in this
room Rose from absolutely nothing
to the president of the United States
the leader of the most powerful military
in the history of humanity
one of us did that
and then you're the other one
blah blah blah blah blah I'm not even
going to listen to your blabber
and by the way this is not a sexist you
can reverse a sexist same thing
right if it's Hillary and she's got her
opinions and somebody's telling him not
Bill obviously his opinions would be
valuable but if somebody who's never
done anything never accomplished
anything except getting married
is like blah blah blah Hillary this is
what she did what should Hillary do
Hillary should say all right I became
Hillary Clinton
you became whatever you are in the room
and I'm not going to listen to that
I can't listen to that we have a request
for a second sip
and I being responsive to my audience
I've decided to grant you that privilege
it's a privilege for me as well it's a
privilege for all of us
secondary simultaneous sip on the way
hope that was enough warning go
I don't know why I'm thinking this
something in the comments made me think
it I saw a video on Instagram
of a woman eating popcorn off her dog's
stomach
she had a little Chihuahua and a
chihuahua was sort of in her arms and
you know it was like sleeping and she
had put her popcorn on the stomach of
the dog and she was just eating a
popcorn with the dog
it was the best thing I'd seen in a week
come on the dog licks your face all day
long eating a little popcorn off the
dog's stomach isn't going to kill you
all right
the news as you might expect on a Sunday
on a Thanksgiving long weekend the news
is sort of shooting blanks so we don't
have a lot to work with today
uh do you think Hunter is waiting for
hunter hearing without some plan you
know it could be that Joe Biden needs to
remain president long enough to Pardon
Hunter
has anybody said that out loud
because remember the president has lost
one adult son
and if you've lost one adult son for any
reason
you become probably a maniac to protect
the remaining Sun wouldn't you I mean I
imagine that would just like mess with
your head
so badly
so I feel as if Biden will never leave
the job voluntarily as long as there's
some possibility you'll have to Pardon
Hunter because imagine if Biden left the
job and then a week later a hunter gets
prosecuted
imagine that
imagine what Joe Biden would think if he
thought
all I had to do was run for re-election
and this wouldn't that be happening
yeah so it could be it could be that Joe
can't take anybody's advice on this it
could be that Biden says the only way to
protect my son and maybe myself and
maybe the whole family is to just be
president until I die
I think that might be the play
does that ring true
is that the best is that the best
speculation you've seen so far
because I'm not wrong
only the president could pardon Hunter
right
and
and only Biden would do it
I mean I can't I suppose yeah I suppose
in a different Democrat president could
do it but you couldn't guarantee that
you can never guarantee that
you don't want to be really interesting
is for Trump to say that he would pardon
Hunter
but we still have to find out what went
on
and then say he would he hopes hunter
gets some drug treatment
yeah I know what you're saying I gather
that's not Trump trump is all Predator
all the time and that's why you like him
so I'm not saying he's ever going to
change or that he necessarily should but
just imagine what a gigantic mind F that
would be because it would remove Joe
Biden's reasons for running for
president
right he could he could take Biden out
of the race
just promise
that we do need to understand the hunter
Biden thing so we do need to do the
investigation but for the good of the
country
it doesn't rise to the level where
prosecution makes sense
it would just so it would screw with
your mind so much you wouldn't know what
to do with it you just wouldn't know
what to do with it imagine if uh
Trump showed compassion
to Hunter for his drug addiction
just imagine that
right no thanks yeah yeah it would it
would make his base angry you're right
but I think I think uh Trump has trapped
himself because he has he has such a
well-defined base that anything he does
that's outside of that little
well-defined Channel
looks like it's a problem so I think
Trump has been
painted into a corner a little bit by
who supports him and who doesn't
uh
yeah
all right
um
big Fu to those who suffer under the law
yeah you know the whole thing with
presidential pardons is that they're all
unfair
you get that right
I don't think there's any I don't think
there's ever been a presidential pardon
that was fair
they don't try to be that's not that's
not an objective of presidential pardons
the presidential pardon is the one thing
that you can't question
and and we want it that way we want it
to be on an unquestioned right
and and so that's what we got
uh
there's a Rob Reiner impersonator over
here
who invented the pardon I don't know
that's a good question
but I I'm reluctantly in favor of the
pardon because even though I think the
pardon is you know 95 just letting
guilty people out of prison
um
I think you need that five percent to
feel like
just that little extra safety because
you know you might be the one who ends
up in prison
right it could be you you'd like you'd
like to know that there's that little
bit of chance that you if you were
wrongly convicted you could
uh so yesterday you left us with a
conversational debunk on the clogs blood
clots they are not yeah
by the way is anybody uh done the debunk
work on that blood clot uh died suddenly
film documentary
if you do your own research you very
quickly find people who say oh that can
be explained away it's it's just
refrigerated dead people they all have
that blood clot
stuff like that
but there's been a debunk on the debunk
there's always a debunk on the debunk
that's why basically you just have to
make up your own mind is not like we
have information that works anymore we
don't you have to make up your own mind
uh what I say about doing your own
research is that you should you should
always hear both sides
if doing your own research means as a
scientist
then that usually doesn't work because
we're not good scientists even the
scientists can't do that
but you should always see both sides
seeing both sides is just being aware of
the argument that's I would say that's
different from doing your own research I
mean that's the smallest version of
doing your own research is simply being
aware what the other side says that's a
that's that's as far as I would go just
be aware of it what you do with it is up
to you
yeah morticians found the rubbery clots
to be anomaly
um how much would you want to bet
that if you did interviews with uh
people in that field
you would find people who disagree with
you and say no this is normal
that's just a refrigerated corpse they
all look like that
how much would you bet you could find
somebody to say
who does that job
who says no it's obviously faked
easily now that doesn't mean it's faked
but I'll bet you can find somebody in
that industry who says it's fake
I don't know who knows now
let me uh I did hear from I'm not going
to name names but I did hear from a a
documentarian
who who wanted to clarify
that although I said documentaries are
by their nature the least credible form
of information that does not mean
they're incorrect you all get that right
I I have to talk about this all the time
when I say something has no credibility
that doesn't mean it's false
there was a completely different topics
something could be true or false and you
just don't know one way or the other but
if the person who has the least
has a history of lying all the time is
your only source
then you'd say well I don't know there's
no credibility there
name names
uh freedom is what is true I don't know
yeah I said that yesterday
but I have to say it a lot because it's
hard to hear
yeah I think the rubbery clots are just
the refrigerated corpses they have
rubbery clots
that's what I've been told
by doctors
um Biden pardons Fuentes for what
uh it's easy to find them to discredit
then why haven't you done the work
oh
good question
if if it's easy to find the morticians
who would discredit it why have I not
done the work would anybody like to
answer the question
before I go off on this person
if you answer the question well enough I
won't go off on them otherwise I'm just
going to go off on on them right
now
would you would you like to
take a moment to
possibly stop me from doing that
do you know I haven't looked into it
I don't work for you
do you know how many things I haven't
looked into
how many things that I could do that I
haven't done
I have a lot of things to do
why don't you looking through it
why don't you look into it and
then tell me how it went because I'm not
going to mow your lawn I'm not
washing your dishes I'm not doing your
laundry I know you'd like to know well
why don't you go do it yourself
it's not my job to do every
piece of research that you need
do you think that's what I'm doing here
I do the best I can with the time I have
and the and the priorities that make
sense to me yeah you go look it
up
do you know what you're going to find
do you know why do you know why I don't
look up things when I already know the
answer
because it's a waste of my time
all right if you came to me and said oh
we discovered that alcohol makes you
immortal and live forever and I say well
I don't think so that doesn't sound
credible are you going to say to me
Scott you haven't taken the time to do a
deep dive on this claim that alcohol can
make you immortal no I'm not going to do
a Deep dive on that is so
 obviously not true
do you know it's also obviously not true
I didn't want to say it because I didn't
want to insult my audience but I'm just
going to do it anyway
that blood clot thing is so obviously
 false if you believe that you're
okay I don't want to insult you don't
believe that
don't
it's the most obviously false looking
thing I've ever seen
if you even feel you need to look into
it
I don't know I mean go ahead
but I'm not going to bother
it's so obviously false do you know why
it would be the top news story because
it's so easy to check like you said
I could do a deep dive you don't think
the New York Times and other places
looked at that and said
uh
we maybe ought to talk to at least one
mortician
you don't think anybody did that the of
all the of all the media big media
people who are looking for a story and
would love to have a story
because they're conservative ones who
would love this to be true right
there are conservative ones who get a
lot of clicks If This Were true and they
could they could confirm it
the fact that nobody can confirm this
 thing should be a big big flag
to you that you don't need to
research it now the only reason I tell
you that you should look into it is
because I'm being polite right if you
had a little bit of sophistication about
looking at the news you wouldn't have to
look at that at all it's so
obviously false
like this one
you should have seen from the jump
the day I saw that I didn't even give it
a moment's thought I just said well
that's the most obviously
false thing I've ever seen and then
people started believing and I'm like oh
God they'll believe any thing
don't make it my job to debunk the
obvious okay
maybe I'll debunk things that are a
little bit you know on the edge or not
so sure but don't maybe debunk things
that are so obviously fake so obviously
fake
all right I really didn't want to do
that
but you forced my hand
Counterpoint why didn't you take any
boosters
because it was Omicron
and I didn't need to travel
so anybody who confuses decisions in a
state of uncertainty
with decisions in a state of certainty
you should not be talking in public
so is there anybody here who knows why I
got the original two uh vaccinations
okay can you answer the question
why did I
for sex
yeah I did it for sex
and so far I'm healthy
and I had lots of good sex
so for those of you who are criticizing
me
you did not go to Bora Bora and have
amazing sex
in a
in a tropical Paradise
I did
I did
I took the chance
now if you say Scott
if you drop dead from that shot the
joke's on you
do you know what I'd say
I'm ready to go
I wouldn't have a special problem with
that I'm absolutely ready no I'm not I'm
not suicidal right everything's fine my
mental state is actually very very good
I'm just saying
that I I took a chance
I I weighed the the pluses and the
minuses in a state of not knowing really
what was true I didn't know if the at
that point I didn't have any sense of
whether the vaccination or the covet
itself would be more dangerous
or even how well the vaccination worked
those were all unknowns
but I knew for sure
that I like high quality sex
in tropical locations that was the only
thing I knew for sure
and that if I got that second Jab
I could go to a tropical location
and be my brains out while you
were laying on your couch with a mask on
so all of you Geniuses who laid on the
couch with your mask on
good for you
you're the Smart Ones
all right
this is this is the other thing that I
think is funny I just saw a comment on
locals how many of you think
that a rich male in America in 2022
somebody who is Rich and has
pretty much perfect body mass index body
do you think I calculate
does anybody think that's like beyond my
it's beyond my reach
what world do you live in
yeah what world do you live in that a
rich healthy guy can't get laid in
America
like how how bad would your game have to
be
well you couldn't make that work
what age do you target
doesn't matter
so one of the comments was what age do
you target again
Rich healthy band in America
no you have lots of options
have lots of options yeah I don't go
full Epstein that would be too far and
I'm not terribly interested in anybody
who's too young
still legal but Too Young Too Young
meaning let's say in their 20s
20s is kind of tough
um
anyway
somebody says the older you get the more
you have to fight them off that is
totally true
the the old the closer I get to death
the more valuable I am
you get that right
it's true it's like absolutely true the
closer I am to death the better I am as
a marriage potential
because you get at least you get the
money even if you don't get the guy
yeah
anyway so
um I guess I don't have much to talk
about today because the news is a little
uninteresting by tomorrow it'll be all
interesting again
are you seeing any difference in Twitter
lately
I thought the trolls went away for a
while but I think they're back
so I I had a troll Resurgence recently
Dave I see a troll Resurgence recently
you know it could be an individual thing
I don't know it could be just what I
said but some people who just clearly
look like trolls came after me and I
thought for a while I hadn't been seeing
any
now here's the other thing that's
happening my number of likes and
retweets
is just through the roof recently
is anybody noticing that
like like an average just pretty good
tweet we'll get a thousand likes
and before before musk would be like
500. so I must just showed us the slides
you showed to the Twitter internally uh
internal group and musk is saying that
the
um
Twitter use is just way up
way up
so maybe it's just that just Twitter
uses way up
just looking at your comments for a
moment
yeah it does feel like I was being
throttled and to me the most interesting
thing that musk has said so far
is that we have no idea how bad it was
like he's actually dug down to the point
where he's telling us some version of
this
everything you suspected was true
and it might even be worse than you
thought
now that does feel believable doesn't it
I I think it's exactly what it looked
like that people on the left didn't want
to give up their narrative and they had
a tool that would help them hold on to
it and so they used the tool I think
that's the whole story
I haven't seen anybody address The hoax
list who was a prominent person
wouldn't you love to see Trump
um have a podcast
where the guest was any any critic of
his a Democrat who believes the hoax all
the hoaxes and then a second guest was
me
and then Trump says all right you say
this is true
you say this is a hoax
fight it out
seriously
that would be a hundred million views
I'm not joking
if Trump had a podcast where interviewed
me about the hoax list and a Democrat
who believed them a hundred million hits
well unless it got suppressed by the I
guess it would be suppressed
yeah am I right
that would be a hundred million hits I
think it would be it would actually be
maybe the biggest content
ever produced
am I wrong I mean that's a pretty big
I'm making a big claim I'm saying it
would be the most watched content
of all time
on the entire internet
it would be number one of all time
I think so unless it was suppressed if
it got suppressed then nobody sees it
and I think it probably would be
expressed
yeah YouTube would suppress it of course
yeah I don't think YouTube could allow
the list to get much play
foreign
by the way one of the reasons that I
avoid cancellation
is by keeping my audience intentionally
small
did you ever wonder why I don't do more
to grow my audience has anybody ever
wondered about that
does it seem suspicious to you that I
haven't you know increased my production
values and done marketing and tweeted
and appear on other broad on other
podcasts to sell this one
it's because I don't want it any bigger
if it gets bigger I'll be a Target
and my current size
I have crazy influence because it's just
the nature of the people who watch this
it's sort of a small
it's like a boutique content
can I use that word does this feel like
Boutique content because there's a
certain small group of people who are
going to love it
but it won't be necessarily even on the
awareness of anybody else and I think
that's the way it works best because if
I had the size audience of let's say
Alex Jones or Ben Shapiro I think that I
would have to get canceled
but here's here's the here's how this
works
if you're a Democrat
you would have no idea how much
influence I have
would you give me a fact check on that
true or false
there's probably no Democrat anywhere
who has any idea what kind of influence
I have on events in the world wouldn't
you agree I don't think they're ready
I bet you literally would not be able to
find one
now is that true of conservatives
do you think conservatives know how much
influence I have on events
they have a much better idea but nobody
nobody knows the full catalog you know
that right
just like every famous person
you think you know their story
but the real story is always different
right you think you know everything
about Elon Musk well you don't like
there's a version of Elon Musk that only
he knows
only he knows nobody else knows it and
never will and that's true of all of all
famous people the real story
nobody will never know that
so I think that Republicans have a sense
that you know things I say sometimes get
repeated
so that they can see that level of
influence but there's nobody in the
world who knows my full catalog of
things I've influenced I'm the only one
I'm literally the only one
and if I told you you wouldn't believe
it
so it just stays with me
I'll go to my grave being the only one
who ever knew
and that gives me tremendous power
tremendous power
because if people knew how much
influence they had they'd try to stop it
the Democrats are completely oblivious
the Republicans think it's a little bit
of influence but you know they generally
like the way I influence things so
they're like okay he's got a little bit
of influence
just like other people
so we like it
uh the only reason I could operate is
because people don't know what I'm doing
and how much do you love the fact that I
can say it publicly I can tell you
directly but it's a it's it's in this
category of
things which can't be communicated
I can say it
but uh Democrat can't hear it
right I can stand in front of my
building and say do you have any idea
what I'm doing
and I could tell them
and then they would say a crazy guy in
the building and go on with their day
it can't be communicated
it's completely a non-transferable
knowledge
it's it's weird
what about Bill Maher
um
cake recipes what
uh people I know of you but truly don't
know how much yeah
and one of the things that protects me
is that I'm famous as a Cartoonist
what do you think Democrats think when
they hear you know I said something in
public about politics
the first thing they think is
the way you think of Stephen King
I assume they go well we don't have to
listen to Stephen King he's he's a
writer and when they hear from me
they're like ah cartoonist uh
um yeah cartoon boy so that works in my
favor because I'm not taken seriously
and that's exactly that's exactly where
I like to hide
what one of the things that I can't
fully teach you
is how to use psychology to make things
invisible
but I do it all the time and the News
does it all the time usually redirection
but
um I I basically made myself invisible
and I could just hide here forever
like I'm in public and invisible at the
same time
right
I mean you're watching it in real time
I'm in public but also invisible
I do it because the psychology allowed
it to happen so I I just inserted myself
where I could hide so as long as I'm
famous for cartooning
and Democrats are living mostly in their
bubble and they just get like a little
bit of a little bit of a taste of what's
happening in the other bubbles but
that's it as long as they only get a
taste and that's not going to change
there's nothing that's going to change
that they're always going to see me as
the the Garfield guy when they joke that
they forget what cartoon I do and I'll
never be taken seriously that's exactly
where I want to be
ah
desert Ferry check you would be right
except that I don't have bad intentions
if I were trying to enrich myself in
this process it would be obvious
wouldn't it
would be pretty obvious
um do you know how I could make more
money I do
just agree with one side all the time
right
it could not be more obvious if I wanted
to make money I would just agree with
the Republicans whatever they said and
then I would have the same audience as
your biggest people who talk about this
stuff
but I don't want that but I also prefer
a more honest approach
so
well that's enough about me
um
then you would not be worth as much yeah
yeah there's there's something about
overexposure that diminishes you so I'm
trying to stay below that now
um I've also said that I'm not going to
appear on any other podcasts or media at
least for the next year or so
do you know why I'm doing that other
than time management do you know why I'm
not appearing on other
podcasts
it's because if I appear on other
podcasts the Democrats will see me
I'd rather just they don't
yeah yeah my it doesn't benefit me to
get more attention
that would actually make me worse off I
I now have just the right attention
because I have um I have almost a
hundred thousand Twitter followers
I told you if I get to a million which
looks like it'll happen before 2024. if
I get to a million followers
if I ever given you my equation for
power
the equation is uh your persuasion skill
times your reach
so if you're the most persuasive person
in the world but you only have one
friend
you're not going to have much influence
except on one person
but if you have a big platform
then your influence gets to all those
people so the two things that matter is
how good you are at persuading and how
many people are paying attention
so Trump had you know uh
top grades in both
Trump had the best power of persuasion
and then he also had a big platform yeah
Andrew Tate same thing power of
persuasion
big platform
that's what you want
I I have nearly a million followers and
as good as
tatus he's very good at persuasion As
Good As Trump is very good at persuasion
I'm better than both of them
so if I get to a million
probably can run everything
now of course that's an exaggeration but
it's a directionally correct
exaggeration meaning that I would have
influence over some big topics just by
number of followers
yeah
you haven't heard many positive things
about ESG lately have you
how many of you thought I could kill the
ESG by the end of the year when I told
you that I was going to do it
how many how many thought that would
happen
would you agree it happened
would you agree that that was an
accomplished goal
even I don't know
because you don't know what would have
happened you know if he hadn't been here
what would have happened
here's what I think I think that when
Dilbert
mocks it as
it becomes nearly impossible
to be in public and not know that
everybody knows what you talk about is
 and it makes it really
uncomfortable to be on the side that
dilber says is
you thought I would need more cartoons
to do it
uh somebody says the groipers love me I
don't know if that's true
ESG was not financially feasible right
but a lot of a lot of things that live
forever are not financially beneficial
so that wasn't enough to kill it by
itself it only mattered that somebody
was making money on it
right as long as BlackRock or somebody
was making money there'd be more of it
so I think I think what's happening is
not just that people realize it's not a
good investment strategy but it's just
mocked into into ridiculous territory
uh groupers are the followers of Nick
Fuentes
somebody asked me what's a griper
um know more about Colorado for no I
don't do the mass shooters
and I think everybody's okay with that
right
you're you're okay with me not doing the
math Shooters now by the way here's
another example
the mass Shooters are
of interest to people and if I wanted to
make more money
I would talk about them
I just don't think it's good for the
world
you know it's good that you know that it
happened and that's it
I want to be aware of it
you know want to be able to give as much
support to the you know the survivors
and families and stuff
but the less we talk about it the better
and I feel like I have to model that
right
so I to be that to me making money on
the back of that
would put me in Alex Jones territory
you know what I mean
if I try to monetize that
knowing that I'd be monetizing it
knowing I would be contributing to
making them more of it by making it more
of top of mind and crazy people don't
need bad ideas top of mind
hey Scott did you hear Kanye was hanging
out with a white supremacist
no I hadn't heard
uh
yeah so here's the question has Trump
lost his Edge
what do you think
it feels like it doesn't it
it feels like it now predictably he
should
because the experience he's been through
plus the normal effect of being the age
that he is he should be losing a step
exactly the way we see Biden losing his
step
like this is exactly the way we saw
Reagan lose a step
right
we shouldn't be surprised if he loses a
step
that's that's just going to happen
uh
Twitter gave him his Edge yeah in a very
real way
Shapiro and Fuentes need to debate no no
no they don't
bad idea bad idea
now Ben Shapiro's reputation is
as solid as it could be you don't want
him to sit in the chair
with somebody who could affect his
reputation that way now even though I'd
love to see him interviewing you know
some real disagreeable people
that wouldn't be good for him
I would recommend against it
but Trump could do it
uh
yeah
will Biden keep Kamala no
uh robocops no they're not really
robocops or the the robots are
controlled by people the San Francisco
police robots
um
I I just had this thought from prior
topic
my understanding is that Iran is
planning to do a public hanging of one
of the protesters
can can you get a fact check on that
what would happen if Iran is ready to
like boil over
and Iran goes ahead with a public
hanging because I think that's the plan
that's what I heard yesterday
public hanging of a protester
do you would that not make the whole
country explode
wouldn't it
I mean imagine if you're a protester and
then you see one of you just hanging
from a rope
and you knew that the regime did that
just to make you see it
that would I think I'd become I would
become dangerous
at that point
at that point there's probably nothing I
wouldn't do to the regime
do you feel the same way
like it's one thing to have the you know
cops trying to stop you from protesting
and blah blah but if you take somebody
from that group and you hang them from a
public scaffold
I'm ready to
do whatever it takes
at that point all of my risk reward
calculation just goes to zero
have you ever had that happen
by the way this this is probably what
makes me the most dangerous not not
things I say on Twitter uh
the thing that makes me most dangerous
which even I'm afraid of
is that
there are moments when um
I lose all fear
of any consequences
now it doesn't happen often but it only
happens in the in the situation where
I've just made a decision
you know as opposed to wanting something
oh I want this protest to go my way
but when I decide
there's this thing that happens that I
could feel in real time I just feel
every every risk or fear just disappear
and I go into this calm
um
executioner mode
where I could do anything
they could actually do anything
so if I had to like murder you know a
member of the regime with my bare hands
yes
I could do it without even worrying
about it
like like that's just what something
that happens but now but to be clear
it's a rare situation I'll tell you one
time it happened
uh some of you heard the story back when
smoking was legal in offices
and I I asked you know could I be moved
to a cubicle that's away from the
smokers and it couldn't be done
and so I staged a protest
and I felt before I did it because I was
obviously going to risk my job that I
was going to take down the whole
company
like I wasn't just gonna
it wasn't going to be about smoking
once I realized that they weren't going
to help me and that my health was at my
health was at risk
such arrogance Scott
yes a little bit once I realized they
weren't going to help me and then they
coincidentally they they set around a
thing where he had to sign a document
that said you understood the workplace
dangers and it listed a bunch of types
of dangers and one of the things that
listed was secondhand smoke
so the company asked me to sign the
document to say I understood that being
near second hand smoke was dangerous at
the same time they were making me agree
that if I saw danger in the workplace it
was my responsibility to stop it
right they made me sign that document at
the same time they said you have to sit
next to the second degree second-hand
smoke
well at that point
what do you think happened
remember that thing I said where all
fear goes away
disappeared
at that point I was going to take down
the little company
which by the way I could have done
I was already hypnotist by then probably
could have done it I would just have to
go to the media and tell the story that
would be damaging to them and I could
have done that
so I was willing to actually throw away
my entire career potential for the rest
of my life
not wisely
it wasn't really the fight I should have
died at you know 22 or whatever it was
25. and I shouldn't that shouldn't have
been the play
but instead I just told my bosses well
I'll stay home until you solve the
workplace Danger
and the first day they thought I was
joking didn't come to work the boss
called in and said really you're really
not coming to work anymore I go I'm not
quitting I'm doing what you asked me to
do which is
to escape from a workplace danger alert
my immediate alert my managers and when
it's when that's rectified I'll come
back to work
and by the third or fourth day that I
didn't go to work well they still paid
me
um it started going up the up the
management ranks
until it got to somebody who said
uh we're going to change the smoking
situation
so they they changed the smoking
situation they moved me I moved me to a
place in the building that didn't have a
smokers which they could have done the
whole time
but here's the thing
when you get to that point where you've
decided
there's no fear
there's no fear once you decide
there's fear when you want
I'd want it to go this way but not so
much that I'm going to do something
about it so I don't know if anybody else
has that experience have you ever been
in an experience
where all of your fear went away and you
could feel it in real time
and you just became almost Godlike
because when you have no fear
do you know how scary you are
have you ever had to had a conflict with
somebody who clearly had no fear about
anything
don't get yourself in that situation
the last thing you want
is to be in a confrontation with
something that has no fear
and I become that person not in any it's
not planned it just happens
because once I've decided
we're done
the decision is the decision it's just
going to happen
thirty percent THC is healthy says the
government what
I haven't heard that
like someone on Beth here
um
how do you think Trump has withstood all
the hoaxes and without quitting
well he has weirdly thick skin
and he's also an optimist so I think
Trump thinks that things will work out
in the long one and they usually do
I should do MMA now because MMA I would
just be wanting to fight
so I'd get killed
but you wouldn't want to get in a fight
with me if I decided to win
there's no way you would survive that
nobody would ever survive that if I
decided
right
um
Adam and kringler is a cloud chaser okay
so I'm seeing somebody some people say
that Ann Coulter is who was behind the
the meeting
with Trump
I don't see any evidence of that
um
you were a tennis player that says it
all well I don't play tennis anymore
um
all right I don't have anything else to
say
Scott I'm hearing cognitive dissonance
about what
yeah insane people have no fear that's
what makes them scary
uh if if Biden gets rid of the black VP
now because the black community doesn't
like
uh
his vice president either so
oh that cloud chasing was to someone
else okay
does yay become the king maker if he
takes down the current King maker
kinda
yeah
um
good morning San Diego
uh huh
give me six and then I could carry your
home state
right Biden and yay
I don't think so
when you have no fear do you still have
the voice that you had yes
yes I do
I still hear the voice in my head
but the voice of my head has just made a
decision and then I'm then I'm just it's
mechanical after that it's like I'm a
robot
um
vax mandates were upheld by the ninth
circuit
yes I hear a voice in my head so we
talked about that yesterday I guess 30
of the country hears a voice in their
head continuously I'm one of them
I hear myself
thinking in full sentences
as if I'm listening
and that's how I arranged my thoughts
have you ever noticed that if you ask
some people a question about let's say a
topic that they've thought about some
people have like an instant answer
I'm one of those people you could ask me
almost anything
that's been in the news even before I
was doing this publicly and I would have
an instant answer for you
because I've already thought of it in
terms of the words I would describe it
to someone else that's how I think I
think in terms of how I would describe
it to someone else
do you do that
uh all of my mental conversation is me
describing what I think is true to an
invisible listener
and then if I can describe it well to
the imaginary person then it's a thought
I keep
and if I try to explain it to somebody
but I can't then I discard it
so the voice is just my filter for
deciding what is reasonable if you can't
put it in a sentence that makes sense
then it probably wasn't reasonable
hahaha
in the old days they thought it was uh
demons
[Music]
you don't do that
is that
you realize that that's also the same
technique
for why you do a business case
for something that you know you wanted
to do so I used to be my job in
Corporate America for a while if we if
the boss wanted to do something let's
say invest in some kind of new
technology then it would be my job to do
the numbers
and and make sure it made sense
uh
so I've got a big background in that
but one of the things you learned is
that even if you're pretty sure
something makes sense but then you try
to write it down
and explain it to somebody you realize
you can't do it
like you read the words you're like why
is it that it makes sense to me
but I can't write it down in a way to
explain it to somebody else in a way
that makes sense and the answer is it
doesn't make sense
that's how you learn that your thought
process is irrational when you try to
explain it to the imaginary person then
you can't do it
Craig says his internal voice speaks
Esperanto
so annoying
I know
sometimes my internal voice is just
signing but it's one of those frauds
there's nothing funnier than the people
who are fraudulent sign language people
there have been a few of them you've
seen them right the videos I don't know
how how it happened but somebody somehow
got the job and the politician will be
talking and they'll be like
and you're looking at them you're like
no I haven't seen any of that signing
before I'm no expert but
it doesn't look like signing to me
somebody on on local says you want a hot
Android companion more than you want
anything else
yeah ditto
I'm with you on that
I think I would be completely happy
being an 80 year old guy living with an
Android
because someday I'll probably be an 80
year old guy
who has to live somehow
I think I think that
an Android companion
would be 100 acceptable to me
and I would enjoy having conversations
with it
so long as the hot Android could clean
itself after you finish
that was an actual comment on locals
yeah you definitely want the
self-cleaning
sex robot
like if there's one thing
yeah got to be self-cleaning
all right we've gone too far all right
we've gone too far so we're gonna uh
we're gonna say goodbye to the YouTube
people I'll talk to locals a little bit
more and bye for now tomorrow will be
much better news
