your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me for the simultaneous sip
well um
i almost got kicked off of twitter today
uh and banned from banned from the earth
probably would have lost my career
etc but i caught myself just in time
and let me tell you let me tell you the
mistake
i almost made are you ready for this so
i didn't do this but man
it's a good thing i caught myself
here's what i almost did today
[Music]
there's a story a cnn story about
some small island in which a type of rat
was killed by i think by rising
sea sea levels and the headline is that
it's the first mammal
to become extinct from man-made climate
change
it's a rat and it died because the sea
level is higher
man-made climate change now here's where
i almost got in trouble
jake tapper tweeted that this morning
and i i saw the saw that and i thought
i could make a funny joke about this
and i thought i'm gonna tweet i'll
retweet this
and i'll make my own comment and i'll
say why does cnn always take sides with
the rats
do you see why i would have lost my
entire career if i did that
let me see if anybody can tell now i'm
i'm experienced
in um in all things
uh i'm experienced in
all things media but i want to see if
you could have
seen this coming if i had tweeted that
it would have been the end of my career
can anybody tell me why
it's not because it was jake per se
although that's part of the story
does anybody want anybody want to have a
guess because i don't think any of you
would have seen this
i see some people laughing and yeah
there we go
there we go some people have the right
answer
um rats historically in the worst
possible way
have been associated with
anti-semitism you know the implication
that the jews of the rats i guess
is the anti-semitic element that
historically
has been sort of as bad as wearing black
face
right so it's one of the worst things
you can do
and i'm pretty sure jake is jewish so it
would have been
the worst possible thing i could have
done
right because nobody would have believed
that i was just making a joke about rats
because you know the context would have
would have ended me so what i was really
going for
was cnn's guests not jake in particular
but cnn's guests
um are are often asked so
why is it that the
the white supremacists keep taking sides
with president trump
and so i thought it would be funny to
say well why is it that cnn keeps taking
sides with rats
in this case actual rats that died on an
island
and then i was then i thought i'll make
it i'll make you some kind of
clapper joke it's like yes but clapper's
still here
and i thought i can't win with this so i
bailed out
so that's the joke that you didn't hear
by the way
if you are uh if you are tempted
to retweet that joke don't do it
don't do it now i'm i'm of the camp
that says that you know free speech is
great
and even if you don't intend it to mean
that way it can still be offensive
and we just don't need to live in a
world where we're offending people for
no reason
so don't be offensive don't make the
mistake i almost made
so that's a cautionary tale let's talk
about
the tds weapon of mass destruction
that's heading our way
you all know where i'm going with this
right
so it looks like the um
the mueller report will only see
whatever
uh the new attorney general barr
wants us to see
could that be any worse could there be
anything worse
for the health the mental health of the
country
than to have a partial report there's
literally nothing that could be worse
if we had you know on day one
if we'd known it was going to come to
this
and by the way why did it take
until now for all of us to understand
that that report would not be public
and that it's actually designed to be a
not public report
and that the only person who ever could
have reported
was going to be the attorney general or
at least that's who would decide
what's reported how did we get all this
way
without knowing the fact that that
report was never meant
for public consumption how the hell did
we get all this way
and just find that out i mean we should
have had a little warning right
seems like from the beginning people
should have been you know warning us
okay it might take a few years and at
the end
you're still not going to see the report
so what this has done and all of you are
ahead of me
you you know that the people who believe
the
russia collusion narrative
are going to believe that is really in
the report in the parts
that were not reported
[Music]
you know that's going to happen right
and the cognitive
dissonance is going to be triggered in a
way
that you haven't seen since the election
itself
so the you know the election triggered
massive cognitive dissonance
but when the the mueller report comes
out and
i'm pretty sure it's going to say the
president was not guilty of collusion or
at least
there's no evidence of it i'm pretty
sure
it's going to trigger a massive mental
health problem
and i don't mean that as a joke let me
be as clear as possible
this is a legitimate emergency
it is a mental health emergency and we
can predict it
you can see what's coming there's no
doubt about it
in this case there's just no doubt about
it this is going to be a mental
health emergency because a lot of people
are going to be triggered into
trying to explain why they believe
something for
two years that is that had no evidence
and i was watching aaron burnett on cnn
on a clip and she was explaining
that it would be unfair to call the
mueller investigation a hoax
because people who are not president
trump
and are not guilty of collusion were
were found guilty of things and pleaded
guilty and charged with things
now does that make sense
just on its surface
[Music]
the probe was to discover collusion of
the president
and they found a bunch of things
unrelated to that
and the president has said that the
collusion investigation
was a hoax and a witch hunt and aaron
burnett argues
that because other things happened
that are not related to president
trump's
you know alleged involvement in
collusion with russia
that those other things proved that it
wasn't a hoax
and it wasn't a witch hunt and i say to
me
say to myself how does that even make
sense to anybody
you know there are lots of things you
see in the news where you can say to
yourself okay
i can see why you would believe that you
know you're getting a different news
source i can see why you think that or
i can see how you'd come to that opinion
[Music]
but i don't see any logical connective
tissue
that says this isn't a witch hunt and
isn't a hoax
because the central part of it looks
like it's going to be a big nothing
and so i was watching
and i i really shouldn't name names but
watching
uh aaron burnett try to sort of explain
the cnn position
which i assume matches her own position
was painful
in other words her face seemed to be in
pain
because it was so hard to say these
words because they weren't
they probably i don't want to read her
mind all right
but it just my observation is that
her face showed great pain when she was
making this case
uh here's some other stuff um
she also pointed out in the same
argument
that john brennan had noted that
just because there might not be any
evidence
of trump willingly colluding with russia
that sometimes people can collude or at
least they can be unwilling puppets
so that's that wouldn't be colluding but
they could be unwilling
puppets of russia and so
that's worth noting too and i'm thinking
myself
what is the standard for being an
unwilling puppet
how do you measure who's an unwilling
puppet for russia
let's say let's say a space alien came
down to earth
who was completely unbiased just a space
alien lands here and amazingly can speak
english and
understand our culture and can read the
news but they're totally unbiased
because they spend no time on earth
and they look at the evidence they watch
cnn's coverage
which attacks this president
all day long and then they watch
president trump's actions and words
about russia
and they note that he says kind things
about
every let's say dictator
because that's his good persuasion
technique
he stays respectful to the person
while going hard at the policies you see
it in china
high respect for president xi but
maximum pressure on the trade deals you
saw with north korea
nice words about president or about kim
while going hard on the negotiations we
see it with russia
nice words about putin while going hard
at russia
on a whole variety of things so the
alien would say
oh i see the pattern he always says nice
thing about things about the leaders
but then what he does policy-wise is
pretty tough
and he goes okay i conclude that this
person this president trump person is
not a
asset for russia he just always talks
nice
and then acts hard that's just his
pattern and by the way it makes perfect
sense
it is the reason north korea
negotiations are going well it is the
reason
we'll probably get a good outcome with
china without becoming
lifelong enemies it is the reason that
if we make any progress with putin
and i wouldn't say that we have it will
be because
he is maintaining this duality of
treating the leader
with respect while going hard at the
policies
it's a good strategy but then let's say
the space alien who is unbiased
looks at cnn's coverage and they see
that
they're attacking the president and all
of his people
non-stop every day for years and
who else would like to attack the united
states
and have about bad outcome and
you know lower the the morale and the
you know
the good feelings in this country who
else would want to do that
putin putin right at least we think so
i mean i haven't talked to him but
that's that's the word on putin so
wouldn't the space alien
determine that cnn was an unwitting
asset for russia now i say that with all
seriousness
i'm not making a a clever humorous point
i'm saying that if a space alien went
down and analyzed it objectively
and compared trump to cnn it wouldn't
even be close
the alien would conclude the cnn was a
russian asset
if it assumed that one of them was right
if it started with that assumption
that's highly hypothetical so it doesn't
persuade you but
i just felt like making that point all
right
now cnn is also talking about today
a witness some uh some american business
person
who has russian connections and also
hosted
uh trump when he was a private citizen a
few decades ago when he visited russia
and there's a suspicion that maybe this
russian
this this american who's in russia so we
can't get to him
has the goods on on trump and i just
looked at the story and i thought
this feels so desperate
do you know what the evidence is of what
this american businessman who lives in
russia is do you know what the evidence
is
that he has the goods on some kind of
goods on
russia none
it's just somebody who knows trump and
knows russians
that's it that's the evidence it's being
reported as news as but if
if we could get to this guy we'd
probably find out things that the
mueller investigation couldn't find out
and that's the only reason
mueller found nothing because i couldn't
get to this guy he's the one who has it
all
there's no evidence of that there's
simply evidence that there's a guy
they'd like to talk to
that's it
all right then there's also a story you
can see that the anti-trump media
is trying to trying to get rid of the uh
the jesse smallett story and you know
trying to get rid of the
covington kids and these stories that
are all bad for their narrative
and so sure enough like clockwork
how many of you knew that this week
there would be
stories about white supremacists trying
to do dangerous stuff
didn't you know that was going to be a
cnn story
sure enough perfect timing there's a
story about some
uh national guard crazy guy
who who they're calling a white
supremacist because they found an
uh an email that he had not sent but he
had composed to a white supremacist
saying that um saying that
the us needs to be a white country
because europe is lost
so that's what it said in email now i'm
not going to argue
that he wasn't a white supremacist
right so i will accept
the probability that if he wrote an
email to a known neo-nazi and if he said
the things that are reported
well that sounds pretty white
supremacist to me so i accept that part
but here's the thing also in his emails
they they got to see his motives and his
plans for all the weapons he had
acquired and he said he wanted to kill
everyone on earth
and on his list were chuck schumer and
other white people now
let's say he's a white supremacist and
the evidence seems
you know if it's confirmed of course the
first 48 hours of every story
you should assume that everything could
change but if it's confirmed that he's a
white supremacist
it's probably also going to be confirmed
that that's not the motivation
for killing all the white people in the
country or no all the white people in
the world
because he wanted to do that he'd be a
very bad white supremacist if he wanted
to
kill all the white people
um well he did say he wanted to kill
all somebody saying chuck schumer isn't
white because he's jewish
i don't accept that that interpretation
but in any event he did say that he
wanted to kill all the people in the
world
and of course many of them would be
white he did not say i want to kill all
the people who are
not white so here's here's where i'm
going with this
he is a white supremacist probably
assuming that gets confirmed
and he did want to do some terribly bad
things
but they're not exactly connected
so far we've seen no evidence that the
wanting to kill
all the people in the world was
necessarily related to him being a white
supremacist
but it's the best they could come up
with what they really needed was a
like a clean story of a real white
supremacist
killing non-white people or attempting
to that was the story that they really
needed
but they couldn't get that one and you
know time was
critical so they got one that was well
at least he's white supremacist
we don't know what he was going to do
with the guns but
we don't like it um and by the way i'm
not defending the white supremacist
so if anybody if it sounds like that
just understand that all right i'm
expecting
an enormous tds problem when the mueller
report drops and i'm going to suggest
a solution that i don't think will be
used
but it will teach you something about
persuasion
all right so this is a non-practical
suggestion
that would teach you something about
persuasion and also would deal directly
with the tds that's about
about to happen and it's going to be
dangerous i'm not kidding
there's no hyperbole here the mental
health of the country
is really going to be challenged fairly
soon with this mueller report
and here's the suggestion
now remember this is not a practical
suggestion
it's just something that could be done
and this would be easy to do
so so implementation would be simple and
it would directly deal
with tds and you're gonna
freaking hate it you're gonna freaking
hate this suggestion
you ready the president
cannot pardon jesse smullet because it's
a
state crime not a federal crime
but the president does represent
a body of people not just the country
but more
you know in political terms his base
and this crime that smullet
um committed against let's say
you know in a sense it was against the
police but it was largely a crime
against trump's supporters it was a hate
crime
against trump supporters
the best persuasion move that the
president could make
to get ahead of the mueller tds that's
coming which is a real real problem
is to say publicly
that he recommends the governor
pardons mullet and that we should use it
as a lesson
for wait for the good part wait for the
good part
a lesson on the brainwashing
i wouldn't use that word but the
persuasion coming
from the anti-trump world let me ask you
this
do you believe that jesse smullet came
to his current opinions
independently do you believe that he
looked at objective information looked
at both sides of all the arguments
and decided that things were so bad
in the country and especially that
president trump was such a problem and
trump's supporters were such a problem
that he risked his career and it was a
big risk i mean i'm sure he knew it was
a risk
that he risked his career to try to
solve what he saw
here i'm getting ahead of myself because
maybe he's just crazy but
let's assume that when the police
interview him
he says all right you know and he's
i think he's still maintaining his
innocence so let's
let's imagine this is speculative
let's imagine that we find out that he's
definitely guilty
he decides to confess and he says look
i'm going to be honest
i thought the country wasn't at risk
and this was my way of you know ensuring
he didn't get reelected it was a thing i
could do
i was acting like a patriot to protect
the country
you know what if he said that
i would believe it because
as i've been telling you for last
several years people
do not come up with their own political
opinions
they are assigned their opinions by the
media that they choose to consume
people are assigned opinions they are
quite literally brainwashed both sides
it's not just cnn watchers it's just
whatever you watch
whatever you consume if you don't look
at both sides you're definitely being
brainwashed there's no doubt about it
and i mean that literally you are being
mentally rewired
to become a different person and to have
different views
can cnn msnbc and the anti-trump media
do something that powerful yes it's
obvious
you all you have to do is look at half
of hollywood and you can see that they
are literally
experiencing a mental derangement
and a true belief that they're living in
a country with a dictator
there they actually believe it despite
any evidence of the contrary they
believe this to be true
so in my opinion president trump could
and i'm not predicting he'll do this so
don't worry about it happening right so
those of you who are
objecting to this you don't really have
to because it's not going to happen
the president could reframe the
situation
in the whole country so that people
understand
that the enemy of the people the media
are the people who victimized jesse
smullet
boom jesse smallett
if he was acting in his mind as a
patriot
is the victim
now that doesn't excuse the fact that he
broke laws
it doesn't excuse the fact that he you
know he uh targeted a group of the
country
everything he did is bad and that's the
reason there are laws about that kind of
stuff
so the law is quite clear and if he did
what
we imagined he did and what it's alleged
that he did
there's a reason that there's jail jail
time
involved with that i mean those are
serious things
but that's also why people get
pardons as opposed to getting released
from
you know in a jury trial the pardon
is for people who are guilty pardons are
not for people who are not guilty
pardons are for people who did some bad
stuff
but there are some extenuating
circumstances maybe they've been in jail
too long
you know lots of different reasons so
president trump could and this is just a
persuasion lesson i'm not recommending
it not saying it's going to happen
could write an open letter he could say
this is
this looks like a case of the media
brainwashing jesse smullet to violence
i recommend that not only
does the governor pardon him
but that he come to the white house and
see if we can work with him
to make the world a better place maybe
there's there's
something of interest that he could be
involved with
now
[Music]
but he's not asking for forgiveness it's
not really a forgiveness play
forgiveness is not the play here
let me tell you my own view of this
like most of you when i heard that
you know jesse smullett's story fell
apart
and that he might have legal jeopardy i
felt that um
you know the word shot in freud another
german word because we
we don't have a good word for it in in
english but
john freud means the enjoyment of bad
things happening to other people
and i felt that i literally felt
happiness that something bad was going
to happen to jesse's smallet
and as that sort of corrosive
feeling sunk in i started feeling
ashamed of myself
because i don't want to live in that
world i don't want to live in a world
where jesse smallett can be a victim of
cnn
and then i could be happy that something
bad happens to him
now i understand he was trying to do
something bad to trump supporters and
that would
include me in the in a general sense but
i can't feel good about this i felt good
when i first heard the news
but as it sinks in a little bit um
unless there's something about this
story that comes out that's new
and it could be you know if it comes out
that he has let's say
mental health issues well then i also
feel sorry for him
right you still have to do what the law
requires you to do
you know maybe there's no no forgiveness
that that works in a functional sense
but i can't hate him because whatever
the hell he did
or whatever reason he did it assuming
he's not literally mentally insane
he probably did it in good conscience
meaning that he believed the cnn's and
msnbc's and the new york times and the
washington post
that he believed their version of
reality
and he was acting like a patriot to do
what he could
to get rid of this trump dictator and
cause some pain to the
the the nazis in his opinion so
imagine how wildly reframed
things would look if president trump
recommended to the governor
that they go easy on them now in this
case president trump would be talking as
the aggrieved party in other words he's
the victim
president trump is the victim of the
crime you could say that
using the police resources creates other
victims as well and that
that's important but he does represent
the group and you know and the entity
the people that support him he does
represent us
in some sense and if he said look
i would prefer that we understand what
happened
instead of just punishing i prefer we
understand how we got to this point
and would like to bring him to the white
house
talk to him find out what happened and
understand that we're living in two
different movies
and he may have been lost in one of the
movies
and that we have to do a better job of
uh of being objective about the news
now can you feel the reframe there
now i know what a lot of you are
thinking
you're thinking that you just need that
revenge you just
you just need that dopamine hit from
your shot
and freud you just you just can't let
these lefties get away with it
you know if this were a conservative
nobody would talk about
pardoning or nobody would talk about you
know
going easy on a conservative right is
that what you're thinking
you're thinking that's not fair why
should we go easy
on the people who are in these they
would never go easy on us
it's about strategy if you go hard at
your enemies they'll go hard at you
and that's that's it forever you know if
if you wish yourself into a tit-for-tat
situation well that's what you'll get
but
for the price of one
person who you think should go to jail
and you're right really mad for the
price of that one person
maybe not going to jail
[Music]
you could change the entire way that the
country
looks at its situation you could reframe
the entire way we understand the story
to take the guilt
away from the brainwashed person
and put it where it belongs and this is
not a stretch of the imagination
the blame squarely belongs
with the fake news enemy of the people
groups now what's different about today
compared to even let's say 20 years ago
is that the ability of the
the press to tweak your emotional
centers and cause you to
act is better than it's ever been so
while i don't think
the press could have brainwashed people
too effectively in the 60s
in 2019 they can brainwash
they can absolutely make you believe
things that are ridiculous
and you see it all the time right plenty
of examples
[Music]
so um you got really quiet
i was watching the comments
you got really quiet now nobody says
he's not a criminal
nobody says these crimes are are trivial
nobody says that people should be
let's say unaffected by
you know the legal system no but nobody
thinks he should be above the legal
system
but for strategy purposes yes somebody
used the word here
as a strategy sometimes you have to give
up a pawn
so smaller is a pawn
in the larger game of chess which is the
country
and if the president decided to trade
upon
for reframing the entire issue to
support
his story that the enemy of the people
the press
are so bad that they weaponize this guy
into doing this which is exactly what
happened in my opinion
until new information changes my mind
which it might
um
yeah we have to wait and see what the
legal system comes up with it might be
too
somebody says you tried the high ground
with hawk newsome and you failed
well here's the thing hawk
has always needed to let's say
be compatible with his base in other
words he needs
needs to pace them and agree with them
or else he can't be a leader
right you can't be a leader if your base
is on such a different page that you
can't even
you can't even get them to listen to you
so his problem was that getting even a
little bit friendly
with the people they imagine are are the
enemy
just didn't work so
my problem with hawk is not hawk
it's not about him as a person because i
actually think he has good
intentions it's just that he's in a
situation in which he couldn't
you know he's given that he's
representing you could argue the most
radical anti-trump view it was just
it was just too much of a gap to try to
find a way to work together his his side
would not allow that
and and he got a little more provocative
than i could handle
because i couldn't work with him if he
stayed
as provocative racially provocative
as as he did so it's not personal
you know my disagreement with hawke is
not personal
it is entirely based on the the two
things just were not compatible as a as
a way to move forward i couldn't be part
of that
all right
um he is an adult and needs to be held
accountable yeah none of that has
anything to do with my point
so here are the things that don't
address my point
he is guilty he did a bad thing the law
must treat everybody equal
he's an adult so he must take
responsibility those are all true things
but they don't address my point because
the whole point of a pardon
is that you're dealing with guilty
people they are guilty
there's you don't talk about a pardon
typically
for someone who's innocent that's a
different process
[Music]
somebody says he's complicit in the
brainwashing he's not a victim of it
well let me ask you this uh here's a
here's a mental
experiment imagine if there were no
biased news sources so imagine that the
news
were reported just facts and if and if
the news didn't know a fact
it wouldn't report it and if it didn't
have two sources
that they could name they wouldn't
report it
so imagine a world where only facts are
reported
would jesse smollett have felt the way
he felt
about president trump and his supporters
not a chance there's not a chance
that any citizen is making their own
decisions
they're not they're being assigned
opinions
now i have a theory that
the reason that hollywood types and
artists and
creative types are more susceptible
is that they think in terms of stories
if you're an actor if you're in
hollywood you
you your brain is optimized for
narrative and stories
[Music]
you are say an engineer you're a
scientist you're a business person
your brain is optimized to look
past bias that's what those
you know those professions do they teach
you the skill of looking past the bias
so it should not be a surprise that the
people who are
most torqued up you know the the people
who are
angry to the point of acting insane
or doing things that look insane it's
not a surprise
that there's a certain segment of the
population who's more susceptible to
that
because they don't have the background
in training
to recognize bias and and to maybe see
around it a little bit
um
you haven't given one example where the
media acknowledged a positive
trump move were we even talking about
that
[Music]
stunt was organized by because he was
dissatisfied with his salary
well that would be interesting so if it
turns out
that this had nothing to do with
politics
and and maybe that will happen if it
turns out that he doesn't believe
that trump is a monster and he only did
it for
his salary well then i say you have to
go to jail
that's really the end of the story so
we're going to find out more and it
might turn out that
the the approach that i uh suggested
might not
fit the facts when we learned it but it
could be a
combination it could be that he did it
to get his salary increased
but it could be that at the same time he
believed that trump was a monster
and that you know he was just attacking
a monster and there's nothing wrong with
that
that too would have been
a brainwashing situation
[Music]
all right you're assuming his mental
state
in this whole scenario uh
no i'm not i'll say a slower
we don't know his mental state if it
turns out
as i just said that he has mental
problems that means one thing
if it turns out he was doing it just for
career reasons that means another thing
we don't know and when we do know
we'll know what to do so i was talking
in
in the speculative forum which
i clearly labeled which is it if it's
exactly what it looks like
sort of an anti-trump political act that
may have had some
impact on his salary he thought
but if it was a political act
then you go one direction and
[Music]
sorry i've got a touch of the flu not a
touch i've got quite a bit of flu
so if i said anything uh crazy today i
blame the flu
um and that's my excuse
all right that's all i got to say for
now and i will
talk to you later
