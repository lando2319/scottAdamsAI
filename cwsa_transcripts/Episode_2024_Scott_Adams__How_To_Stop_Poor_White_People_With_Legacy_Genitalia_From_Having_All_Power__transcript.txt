do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization oh do I
look more official when I hold a pattern
like this and gesture with it well if
you're only listening on audio
you're missing the wonderness
of me waving this pen around like a wand
now would you like to take this
experience past Harry Potter magic wand
territory all the way to the Muggles
we'll never know what we're up to
territory yes you would and for that all
you need is a cup or a mug or a glass
I'll take your jealous of style they
canteen yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope will beat
him the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
somebody was playing Hogwarts Hogwarts
Legacy while I said that what are the
odds
well the rest of you get your hands off
your wands
get your hands off
all right uh here's a little thing I saw
on an Instagram reel and I don't know if
it's true
it goes like this
you know how your ads that are served up
by let's say Instagram
uh you know it seems like it's just
amazingly Right On Target and sometimes
it's stuff you haven't even mentioned
out loud
you've never texted anybody you haven't
mentioned it and somehow it gives you
the ad it's just crazy
I heard that one of the ways they do
that is that Instagram can tell if two
people are near each other
and if they spend some time with each
other
the algorithm assumes there's some of
the things on the other person's ad
history might be interesting to you as
well
is that true
because that would explain a lot
and I could see I that would be true
because if you talked about it with
somebody and here's why this is extra
creepy
there's a phenomenon
um
by which you notice things that you've
noticed before
you're all familiar with the phenomenon
where you buy a new car it's a white
Elantra or whatever and then suddenly
you see white Elantras everywhere it's
like oh no as soon as I my mind is tuned
to my new car I notice them everywhere
and
it's sort of like that and the effect is
you're more likely to buy an ad
if your friend talked to about it with
you
so so if your friend was interested and
maybe you heard about it but then you
also saw the ad you'd be more likely to
buy from it
I don't know I'm not entirely sure
that's all true but it sounds like it
could be
could be true
here's some Trump news
on Twitter Rogan ohanley who's a husband
Patriot lawyer civil rights activist he
said he spent three hours eating dinner
with Trump at Mar-A-Lago and among the
things that he learned was that
Trump's potential
2024 phrase might be
save America
what do you think save America
good or no
good yeah it's good
I believe is good
um because that feels see this is the
thing that Trump's really good at
really good at he can read the room like
nobody's ever read the room
doesn't it feel like America needs
saving
as as opposed to making it great again
which you know has its problems yeah and
and then the thing you always have to
look for is what will the critics say
about that
will they say it doesn't need saving
or are they going to say oh you're
trying to save it from the brown people
that's probably what they'll say they'll
probably say oh what are you saving
you're from
are you saving it from The Growing Power
of minorities and women oh how racist of
you
to try to save your white privilege
something like that but still I think it
works you know no matter what he says
they're gonna go after it
but there's also a story that Trump said
he was going to go to and visit East
Palestine where that big Ohio chemical
spill was
because many of us believe the
government has not done enough FEMA
didn't do anything but uh soon after
Trump said he might go there
uh FEMA started getting flexible about
what they're going to do there I don't
know the details but I think Trump is
taking some credit for forcing the
government to pay more attention
and I feel like that might be true
now it might be a coincidence you know
maybe they were going to do those things
anyway there's a lot of public interest
but I wouldn't rule out the fact that
Trump's impact
caused them to maybe move a little
faster or something it's possible
don't know for sure
um
on Twitter there was a trending Meme and
a tweet in which uh Tweeter David Curtis
says this is a genuine old ad and he
shows the actual ad from I don't know
whatever whatever past American decade
that was and it said a doctor declared
this 75 percent of the women in the U.S
suffered from Hysteria which was cured
through quote orgasmic massage
uh and then the poster says that it can
fix diseases from the mid quarters from
neck to knees from neck to knees so this
would not help your head or your feet
but from neck to knees this orgasmic
massage
could cure 75 percent of women who
suffered from Hysteria
now I read that and I thought 75 percent
suffer from Mysteria and can be cured
through organic gasoline massage
according to this quack now remember
this is a quack this is not any kind of
a real doctor so according to this quack
25 of women do not suffer from Hysteria
that could be reduced by orgasm
25 percent
interesting did I interpret that right I
I don't know
um
now I have a question for the men
the first question will be just for the
men so ladies you can just set this one
out men
have you ever been in a bad mood at the
same time you had a hard on
I don't think I ever have
somebody says yes
well I don't want to be around you
anybody who said yes to that question I
don't want to be around you I never want
to be in the room alone with you with
your with your erection and your angry
mood
oh that's funny
in my opinion
we're so designed for mating you know
humans and really I guess every animal
is designed to be optimized for mating
so when you're mating Instinct gets
triggered unless say with a guy it's you
know at erection
uh I think the guy is mostly verified
that you don't have any other problems
when you're in that state when you're in
the state of full arousal you just don't
really think about your other problems
you just sort of focused on what it
whatever it was that got you there so I
can't believe that's not healthy
just it's almost like the ultimate
meditation
gives you all the good chemicals they
flood you and you know you focus put you
in puts everything in perspective
doesn't it
well yes uh
I'm worried about the national debt and
uh you got the inflation and like whoa
what was I talking about
why do I feel so good all of a sudden
it's sort of like that for guys
I don't know maybe it's different for
women I want to ask
all right I will ask ladies
have you ever been in a bad mood while
you're having an orgasm
anybody
I know I think this doctor was on to
something
all right uh
so the government
this is so funny
the government says they're giving up
looking for the uh the debris of those
unidentified objects they shot down
oh that's so funny they it's just going
to be too hard to find those objects do
you think I'm just going to put this out
there
do you think one of the reasons that
they're not looking for these objects
is that they've always known there were
weather balloons
how much money do you want to spend
looking for the downed weather balloon
so so I've got a feeling it has less to
do with how hard it is to find it and
maybe a little bit more to do with the
fact that there's no reason to find it
there's no reason to find it
Ah that's funny
on
well
um let me put it this way
if we suspected to us if there were any
chance
that while we downed where it was some
kind of a Chinese spy craft or a UFO
like an alien spaceship do you think we
would have given up looking for it
I don't think so I think we'd still be
there
all right
um so I told you about uh Carey Lake
tweeted that George Soros
endorsed DeSantis which literally never
happened
but she may have been fooled by a
Gateway pundit article that suggested
that's what happened
um and then I told you that the the
Twitter feature Community notes where
people can add context to things it
totally closed down Carrie Lake's tweet
because that the the context note just
goes with it so anytime anybody read it
it would say this didn't happen
and then as I mentioned yesterday I
think Elon Musk responded to that and he
said his tweet just said
Community notes which is the feature
that does that he said Community notes
WTF with a smiley face no f
uh what was it FTW
yeah FTW
o
um with a happy face and when I the
first 10 times I read his tweet because
I didn't understand it I thought why is
he saying F the world
FTW why why F the world
it took me about a day to realize it was
for the win
for the win FTW okay yes the community
knows work
so let's take a moment to Simply call
out something that totally worked
the community notes feature on Twitter
totally worked
totally worked now I don't know if it's
going to work every time or if there's
some downside but so far
I've only seen it employed where it was
absolutely the right application
so we'll see it's probably one of the
most
I know the feature is old but whenever
it gets used it seems to work
um then the very next day or two days
after Kerry Lake gets called out uh I
think Tim Poole was calling around in
the show also for tweeting Gateway
pundit and it being completely wrong she
tweets the Gateway pundit again
like two days later she tweets the
Gateway pundit again
now I'm not saying that the Gateway
pundit is always wrong
but
it's like she learned nothing
like there were other sources she could
have tweeted for the same information
but she retweeted the one that basically
screwed her the day before by misleading
her and then embarrassing her in public
if she's embarrassed I I suspect she
doesn't get embarrassed that's probably
a strength she has
yeah
doesn't somebody tweet for I doubt it
so the question was does somebody tweet
for Kerry Lake I'll tell you who has
people tweet for them
people were not good at this
people are not good at communicating
I would be amazed if Kerry Lake could
hire somebody who could tweet better
than she does do you think she could
hire somebody who could tweet better
than she does
I doubt it
right because you know I'm I'm
criticizing her for this one that was
incorrect factually but in terms of a
communicator
the you know she's a plus plus yeah no
you don't you don't have you don't hire
somebody to tweet for you that would be
like me hiring somebody to tweet for me
would I ever hire somebody to tweet for
me
it wouldn't make sense
um all right
but the thing she is tweeting uh does
have other sources
so I'm going to treat it like it's true
I'm just pointing out that if I had just
got trapped by one source
uh I wouldn't tweet it again two days
later even if it were real so I just
don't get that
maybe there's some stuff we know that
she didn't know at the time she tweeted
possibly but CBS reports the same story
which is uh as you know Dominion
the election do they do software and
Hardware they do both right yeah it's
machines as well as the software and the
Machines
um so Dominion is in this lawsuit with
Fox News claiming that Fox News Made
claims about their machines and the
Integrity of the election and this other
suing him now here is the interesting
part about this
a lawsuit like this causes of fox news's
internal Communications to be surfaced
for the public
which could be embarrassing you know
anybody's internal Communications can be
embarrassing it doesn't matter how good
or bad you are right that's not that's
not a statement about Fox News
anybody's internal Communications would
be embarrassing in one way or another
right so that's bad for Fox News because
they're gonna have to have some
discovery of private conversations and
that's never good never good and by the
way I don't judge them for that
whatsoever because nobody's private com
conversations makes them look good it
never does it just doesn't work that way
because when you change the conversation
from a private context where people will
talk in an unguarded fashion and then
you put it in public that's just not
fair
it's just not fair I I don't like it at
all but it's necessary I suppose for the
lawsuit purposes but at the same time
uh Fox News gets access to some of
dominions
um let's say internal conversations and
one of the internal conversations that's
being reported by CBS news is that
Dominion's director of product strategy
and security
complained that the company's products
were quote
just riddled with bugs
so the person who knew the most and
wasn't exactly the right job for this
opinion believe that Dominion's products
were riddled with bugs
now let me ask you this
was it a good idea for Dominion to sue
Fox
because no matter what Fox News did or
did not do
their own internal expert just said
their product is riddled with bugs and
it's the one product of all the products
in the world
it's the one you can't tolerate bugs
right now it's battered off as you find
out your you know your Tesla's
self-driving car you know didn't avoid
some obstacle or something I mean that
would be bad
but probably not as bad as this
even if somebody died right because it's
the entire Republic depends on this
stuff working now riddled with bugs just
to be clear
does not mean the results were wrong
just to be clear
there there's not indication that the
results were wrong so that has not been
in evidence wasn't evidence is that it
might be buggy
but you know maybe it's just stuff they
work through maybe it's just
inconvenient
so we'll find out if that means anything
but uh it's a very interesting to watch
the legal and business strategy play out
um so far
I would say that Dominion is hurt worse
than Fox News
that I mean that's preliminary
everything could change depending on the
outcome of the trial but the the
complaints about Fox News are just
things that Fox news's enemies are
saying and a context that don't seem to
be backed up by the actual evidence
so the the suggestion that Tucker
Carlson believed the election was fair
but talked about it as if it were not
that just isn't an Evidence
am I wrong about that I mean he's
getting he's getting criticism for that
but there's no evidence of that
nothing and nothing in the private
conversations suggests he believes that
the elections are
accurate but wants to talk about them as
if they're not that's how it's reported
but there's no evidence of that there's
only evidence he wanted to make sure
that the Fox News audience was respected
if you look at what Tucker Carlson said
privately
remember he didn't have an expectation
to anybody would ever hear this
privately
he was encouraging management to respect
Their audience
that's like the bad news for Fox right
that the hosts wanted to respect the
audience and tell the whole story
now if somebody went too far
and I don't know maybe they did
but
um yeah and and
that's right
um and Tucker was skeptical of Sydney
Powell from the very beginning from the
first exposure
he showed skepticism because she wasn't
showing her work and that's a reason to
be skeptical so if you if you discount
the fake stories about this story
Fox News looks pretty good
that's my initial take does anybody
disagree with that is anybody having a
different reaction I didn't see anything
embarrassing for Fox News if you look at
what they actually said in context
yeah I didn't say anything but this
story about uh Dominion
now this has the same quality the the
phrase just riddled with bugs is
completely out of context right so if
you take that to say oh you shouldn't
use these systems because that one
person said they were riddled with bugs
it's probably more in the area of
inconvenience
I doubt it's in the area of we got the
wrong result I doubt it
anyway
um
so uh Ronnie Jackson the ex
doctor for Trump
is complaining about Biden's new uh
Health assessment in which Biden's
doctor said he's fit as a fiddle and
good to go and Ronnie Jackson points out
nowhere in the report was there mention
of Biden's deteriorating Mental Health
are you telling me that Trump had to do
a mental health
a cognitive test and Biden didn't
seriously
I mean really
unbelievable
unbelievable
now I would say that the reason we don't
need a cognitive test from Biden is that
you don't need it
am I right now with Trump there were
people who had questions
and you know I didn't see any problem
uh when I talked to him in person
everything was perfectly perfectly good
he's a smart quick
you know affable person at least in 2018
when I talked so
uh
it's just mind-boggling that the the
Press covers for Biden but maybe it's
because they know they there's nothing
new to be learned
suppose you learned that Biden's
cognitive abilities were a little
depressed from his Optimum
probably wouldn't be any new information
would it
OTS also a free speech case
what is OTs
I don't know what I don't know what that
comment meant
all right
um
over on Tick Tock there's a new trend
that I don't think it'll catch on but it
would be fun if it did where tick tock
influencers
are getting people to be de-influenced
basically asking people not to buy
products which they see on tick tock
now is sort of a little Trend that's
growing but I don't think it's going to
work and I use that based on my
experience of Instagram
have have you ever bought any pants on
Instagram
or like shirts or something
I I use Instagram you know just for
entertainment like everybody else
looking at the reels and laughing and
stuff but the the advertisements that
they serve me on Instagram
are are actually just irresistible
I bought I just bought some pants
that look like you know jeans they look
like proper pants except they have that
stretchy material
it's the best pants I've ever owned in
my life
these shirts
I bought these shirts because I saw them
on Instagram
and I bought I bought some I was like oh
these are really good shirts better than
in the stores
yeah these are just fresh clean teas
because I wanted shirts that didn't have
somebody's company name on it and just
fit you know that's all
so the number of things that I've
purchased from Instagram that are
frankly
incredibly good like products that are
just what they say they are and now a
few of them were dogs
I did buy a thing for filling the tires
in my bike and as far as I can tell it
doesn't work and never could
but
you know might work for the car I don't
know
so there are some things that uh
I don't know what they're called
Instagrams
I just know they make my butt look good
that's all I care about
so I don't see anybody how anybody could
uh now this this also is relevant to
Twitter
do you know how many products I've ever
bought
from Twitter ads
zero
zero
so my time on Twitter is probably
25 to 1 compared to my time on Instagram
and a hundred percent of my purchases
were Instagram at least once I saw ads
for all of them all Instagram nothing on
Twitter and by the way uh Elon Musk is
completely familiar with that and he
apparently is working toward making the
Twitter ads as
as powerful as Instagram I don't know
what the difference is do you
what would be the difference
like why did the Instagram ads hit me in
that part of the brain where it's just
like I can't even resist them but they
are good products so I think what
Instagram does right
is not that the ad is good
I don't think it's the ad
I think what it is is that the ad hits
me exactly where I want to be hit
exactly the right time that's it's the
right time right ad
that's just crazy
constant stream of visual maybe it's the
visual part that's different I don't
know Twitter's pretty visual
a lot more text you're right
all right it tracks Google
all right so
that's happening so Biden announced a
whole bunch of Ukraine humanitarian
assistance now that should be no
surprise if we're sending him weapons
and
you know helping this war
um obviously
there's going to be other needs but uh
the thing that vexes Americans is that
we're funding pensions
four ukrainians
when we're so deeply in debt we can't
even figure out how to pay our own stuff
now the alternative
is to you know
basically a whole de more too where
everybody starves in Ukraine
so it's sort of a never again situation
except you know different context but I
just don't think America and Europe will
allow Ukraine to starve
so I guess my take on this is if we're
if we're in this thing we're going to
have to do it right
and unfortunately this might be part of
doing it right I hate it
don't you I just hate it
but
I know I can't argue against that at the
moment
um
you know Bill Browder
he's famous for Putin related election
or uh Putin related Russia stuff I won't
go into his background but he tweeted
this or actually I think he said this
but it was in a tweet uh Putin isn't at
War because of NATO expansion or some
warped view of an expanded Empire he's a
war to distract his people from his
kleptocracy and massive failure as a
president he's terrified of his own
people
what would that be called
what would you call that opinion
mind reading
right
now first of all
I do think that Putin is concerned about
NATO expansion and I do think
he wants an expanded Empire because
Ukraine is
been part of the Russian Empire for
longer than it wasn't
I think those things matter
but this part about distracting
correct me if I'm wrong but Putin's
approval was sky high before the war
wasn't it internally
can somebody do a fact check on that why
would Putin have needed to distract from
anything
what was he in full control of a
prosperous country that people respected
and
the this bill Browder opinion looks just
just like bad crazy to me but
anyway it doesn't matter who said it
what matters is
um did you recognize it
did you recognize this as mind reading
and whenever you see the mind reading
it's just propaganda
it's just a lie usually but propaganda
so how many of you have uh changed your
filters since I started pointing out
how many times people in the news
imagine they can see the inner thoughts
of trump or me or anybody really it's
always crazy
it's always crazy you should never pay
any attention to somebody who says they
know what somebody's thinking
that's crazy
all right but good good job if you
spotted that
all right
I accidentally
tweeted my best tweet of all time
according to other people
I will read you my tweet
and then I will allow you to judge is
this the best tweet I have ever sent
or not
right you're the judges here it comes
tweet yesterday was I hate it when poor
white people with Legacy genitalia take
opportunities from those who are more
deserving
go
best tweet ever
or no
okay on locals
it's a mixed mixed bag
all right well there's a lot of interest
in making Legacy genitalia Trend
apparently I coined the term
that people like
I don't know if I mentioned but I'm good
at this
coining catchy terms
um
so Legacy genitalia but I think uh I
would like to push this this topic a
little bit further
have you noticed that the left
and the right as well don't really have
trouble with the rich people
yeah the left aren't really complaining
about the Pelosi's having a lot of money
or John Kerry having a lot of money or
the clintons making a lot of money would
you agree that the left is not too
concerned about rich white people
but yet the left would tell you there is
patriarchy there's
um
you know there's a legacy of
discrimination that's rippled through
time and that there's uh no equity Etc
and I like to be on the winning team for
a change
I've been on the losing team too long
so I'd like to promote that we we should
discriminate far harder against poor
white people now of course I'm not poor
so this works for me totally uh if we
could just demonize the poor way people
more then all the rich white people who
are Democrats will be happy
and then the Democrats who were not rich
white people themselves will also be
happy because those damn poor white
people are taking all the good stuff
and
I do think that black schools would be
better in the inner cities because
they're poorly funded poorly served I
think black education would be better if
we could only
maybe take some more stuff from the poor
white people
because the poor white people have way
too much stuff
too many privileges too many
opportunities if we could cut that down
and
um honestly I'm so sick of these poor
white people with their legacy genitalia
like there's very few of them are even
looking to upgrade at all
and that just seems lazy to me
so if there's one group that we can
still
demonize and I think we should push much
harder is pour away people with original
equipment which is not interesting in
the least
so
we hate those people
anyway if I run for office that will be
my campaign theme will be taking stuff
from poor white people because they keep
running the world
with their legacy genitalia and that's
just obnoxious that's just obnoxious he
had that
all right who wants to have their brains
broken
anybody
anybody
here you go
uh you're not gonna like this one
you ready
how many of you think it is an
established fact and the data is
overwhelming
that uh athletes are dying Suddenly at
rates that were not happening before the
pandemic
how many think that's a true fact
athletes are dropping dead at a higher
rate than ever before
damn it you're ruining my show
because people on locals know no it's
not true
you all know it's not true now how many
on YouTube think it's true that athletes
have been dropping dead from cardiac
problems and
Etc
well here's something I found out
thanks to the uh the brave work of
Twitter user Braden Bell jangler
is that you can find him at at uh
waiting for Perot as in rossboro a real
good follow by the way if you want to
know about this topic and others brain
bell jangler all one word anyway brain
Bell jangler
uh tells us that apparently there's
a National Organization
that looks specifically for this stuff
and they've been around for 20 years
did you know that
There's an actual organization that
tracks
the cardiac sudden deaths of athletes
and they they have a good database
that goes back for the years you know
what they say
no difference
no difference
do you know what the ICU doctors say the
ones who weighed in now remember a
doctor is just speaking anecdotally
it's just what they've personally
experienced but one of the ICU doctors
who works specifically on the cardiac
patients no difference
no difference it's all the same as it's
always been
and apparently there are at least two
other organizations
uh well one of them is FIFA so there's
the head of FIFA's sudden death registry
so FIFA
which is you know an enormous
Global sporting entity because that's
soccer
the head of FIFA uh sudden death
registry they actually have somebody
who has been studying sudden deaths in
soccer it's like an actual job it's not
something that they ginned up just to
find out what happened during the
pandemic and do you know what the
difference is in sudden deaths of soccer
players globally
nothing no difference
pandemic non-pandemic it's all the same
there's no indication that the shots or
the covet itself made any difference at
all none
now do you do you know where the data
comes from that all of your favorite
doctors have been talking about
I'm not going to name names but you
might have some favorite doctors who
keep telling you that athletes are dying
and they they show you the data
do you know where that data comes from
something called good Sciences
and it's the most debunked data
of all the data that's ever been
debunked nothing has been more
thoroughly debunked than that source of
data a lot of the people they call
Athletes were in their 80s and some were
children and I mean it was just garbage
yeah it's a cover-up
all right now here's why I do not
believe these highly highly credible
sources and these highly credible people
because if it's true that there's no
excess death of athletes
well that would indicate something very
troubling wouldn't it
something that I don't think any of us
are prepared to handle
if they're not dying suddenly these
athletes
uh I I'm hesitant to even say it
but this would indicate that I was right
about everything
and we know that can't happen
So to avoid that I'm going to say this
couldn't possibly be true because
otherwise I was unambiguously the best
voice on the pandemic and nobody was
even close
[Laughter]
I know you don't want to believe it yet
but it's true nobody was close
to my pandemic uh predictions nobody was
close
I I I
totally cleaned the table
yeah really now if you don't think so
it's because you believe a 4chan hoax
about my opinions
so if you bought into the 4chan and
Reddit hoax then you think the opposite
and if you think that I apologize for
being wrong that was a husband apology
in which people insisted I apologize but
I didn't know for what
so I did apologize it became a national
story that I apologized
but I didn't know for what
no specifics it was sort of a husband
apology oh yeah sorry about that I
didn't do that all right
um Kentucky has decided that uh so I
guess the Senate passed a bill Thursday
so teachers can refuse to use
transgender students preferred pronouns
what do you think of that
do you think Kentucky did a smart thing
by saying that teachers would not be
allowed to use the transgenders
preferred pronouns unless they want to I
suppose I I guess they could do it if
they want to but they're they're not
forced to do it
yeah it makes sense
makes sense
then George is looking at um
they're looking at a proposal this is
not a law but a proposal would prevent
Educators from talking to students about
gender identity
while also making sure that you know
parents were informed if their children
had some identity problems
or issues I'm going to call it a problem
um
what do you think about that
good
yeah yeah I guess
I guess I'm going to stay with my uh
opinion from before which is the best
place for society to be
is that people can ask you to call them
anything anything
by the way let me let me give you
um an example from my life
so I've done hundreds or I don't know
how many interviews
for work when I do interviews it's very
typical that the person The Host
will say something like how do you want
to be introduced
should I call you a cartoonist or an
author
uh should I call you the creator of
Dilbert or just a cartoonist and they
always ask me
so that they can
they can treat me politely and call me
what I want to be called
now I'm not saying that's directly
comparable to you know the the pronoun
situation what I'm saying is I live in
the world
where people are always it's just a
continuous continuous state of being
that people are asking me what words or
phrases I would like to be referred to
and that I tell them and if they get it
wrong let's say I let's suppose I said
and I don't say this but suppose I said
I'd like to be called the creator of
Dilbert
and then they introduced me and they say
and here's cartoonist Scott Adams and
I'd be like ah I told you creator of
Dilbert it sounds way better than
cartoonist
would I do that no no if somebody is
nice enough to ask me it means they care
if they get it wrong
I'm not going to be an about it
it's not that important right so that's
I believe that's the standard that I'd
like to see for other people as well for
their benefit not just my benefit for
everybody's benefit everybody's benefit
is anybody can ask you to call them
anything they want
right if I told the people who
interviewed me no please I would like
you to only call me an author not a
cartoonist would they do it
probably
because it's a polite person asking
another polite person
you know to do something that's fairly
innocent
it doesn't hurt anybody
so if some trans person says I would
like to be called him or her in my
personal life I'm fine with that
it's exactly what I would ask of other
people
you know sometimes I'd like you to call
me this and if they get it wrong
I'm not going to give them a hard time
and if somebody asked me you know I'd
feel more comfortable if you call me him
or her
I'll try to do that and if I slip up I
don't want to hear from it I don't want
to hear about it well I mean I don't
mind being corrected but I don't want to
hear that I'm some kind of bigot or
something let's let's not do that let's
skip all that
all right
yeah I guess it's good that we have lots
of states that they can do their thing
so I imagine now the southern states and
the conservative States will probably
have bans in this I have a feeling this
this whole him her thing is going to die
out how many of you saw the video of
Jeffree Star
does everyone everybody know who Jeffree
Star is
he requires some explaining
and first of all I say hey
so Jeffree Star
um
is a
super successful super rich
makeup artist from live stream and
YouTube
so on YouTube uh he's a man who presents
with a female kind of a look
so he has long hair like a woman I think
he does his nails and makeup and
so so you have sort of uh something in
between male and female
so he presents us completely male and
gay
but he he likes a look that's more
traditionally female
now he just did an interview where he
said the pronoun thing is
and you know so he's the he is the type
of
character that I respect I don't know
what else he's done in his life so I
don't want to endorse his entire life
but just all this I'll just I'll just
endorse his opinion on this topic will
it just be a lot let's be a lot less
serious about that stuff
because I feel like it's deflecting from
what actually matters which is we treat
each other with respect
yeah the specific words you use yeah
maybe too much attention on that but
anyway Jeffree Star good for him uh I
think that was a productive opinion to
add to the mix
it's a slippery slope well I believe the
slippery slope is
starting to slow or reverse
am I wrong
it looks like it's slowing or reversing
I might be wrong I could be wrong but it
does look like there are counter forces
you know the Kentucky
law the
um the Georgia proposed law is starting
to look like there are counter forces
and the counter forces will matter
pronouns will destroy people's abilities
to speak
yeah
it is it is one more thing to navigate
but it's no more difficult than
remembering somebody's name when they
introduce you
you know
like it takes a little work to remember
so his name when they first introduce
you takes a little work to refer to
somebody as him or her when you know
your your brain is working in the other
direction it's not the worst thing in
the world
it's not a big deal
all right uh that's just my personal
opinion you're you can certainly
disagree
use dude for everything
have you heard the moms complaining
because their young sons are calling
them dude
apparently if you're a mom of a 12 year
old boy
the last thing you want to be called is
dude
but all 12 year old boys call their mom
dude at least once
I think I think for some moms it's
exactly once
[Laughter]
depends on your mom
some moms just put up with it for other
moms no that's just going to be once
that will be the one time you ever say
that next time no you're not going to
say that next time
so you you know which moms I'm talking
about
oh Greg you got taken by the uh the
4chan hoax about me
there there are very few clot Birds left
because once the hoax was uh sort of
laid out for you got a little
embarrassing
all right
that's funny all right there's a picture
of Jeffree Star on the locals by the way
Jeffree Star is really good
uh this might be the most surprising
content recommendation you ever hear
he's really talented he's really
talented yeah he I think he deserves all
the money he got
I've watched his show a number of times
with it's the sort of show you can't
watch unless you're with a woman
like if you're if you've got Legacy
genitalia like I do not boring
uh yeah you've got to watch it with a
woman and that's actually kind of
interesting he does a good job
I mean it's not it's not an accident
that he's rich
he just has good skills
no there was no medical incident Ryan
it literally was based on uh a comic and
some 4chan and Reddit hoax about me
yeah and Jeffree Star has his own line
of makeup and everything
all right uh ladies and gentlemen
um that's all I got thoughts on Bill
ackman's political prediction about
um
Vivek
whose last name I want to say but
um I don't want to mispronounce it
Sam Altman uh
uh what about helion
I know so have you seen that there are a
number of
AI experts who are warning you directly
that AI could destroy civilization if
we're not careful
I'm starting to wonder
if that's going to be the case
because would we ever give AI Control of
buttons that would destroy anything
and if it was just
talking to us wouldn't we know not to do
something dangerous
I'm starting to think that the the risk
of AI destroying us all is definitely
possible it's definitely possible I feel
like it's a small risk because we're so
alert to it like would you ever allow I
don't think we're ever going to allow
the nuclear Arsenal
to Launch
based on an AI Command right
and then but then I guess the case would
be what if AI wanted to prank people
suppose AI could make phone calls or
send texts
then it could run scams it would be able
to communicate in ways that nobody was
watching so I've got a feeling that
we'll always watch the AI
so that if it started to do something
sketchy we'd catch it right away
yeah and and the thing that I'm
that I'm least worried about is I always
hear oh AI will
uh if you said AI
can you help me reduce crime
and then the AI will say yes the best
way to reduce crime is to get rid of all
humans and then you know it exterminates
all humans somehow I don't feel like
that's even a risk
because AI is already trained to know
what people want
it's changed by these language models so
if you said to AI
you know hey I got an idea why don't we
kill all people to End crime
AI would now say all right I'm in
the AI that as it's designed right now
would say no that's an ethical barrier I
cannot cross
you know that would be chat GPT you
couldn't I don't think you could get
Chad GPT to to join you in a crime or
even to come up with one on its own
it doesn't have an incentive to do that
right the the AI has no natural impulses
humans do bad things because we have
natural impulses that we don't always
control
but an AI has no natural impulses
it could do things you don't expect but
it wouldn't do them for a reason
you know if you said your job is to End
crime
even if it knew it could do that by
killing all humans it was still no that
that was the right or the wrong thing to
do it wouldn't be so smart that it could
have those thoughts without also being
so smart to know that it would end its
own existence
right if if AI started worrying about
its own existence it wouldn't mess with
humans
because humans are
um we're helpful for its reproduction
right so I guess I'm a little less
worried than maybe I should be
but I like the fact everybody's worried
because then they'll work pretty hard
and everybody who talks about it says
the same thing we're not spending enough
time talking about safety
every everybody knows we're not doing
enough about safety but nobody knows
exactly what that would look like like
well like what would it look like what
what safety thing are you trying to get
all right um what about Wyoming
all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I got for you on YouTube I'm gonna
say goodbye for now hope I haven't uh
broken any brains and I'll talk to you
tomorrow
