maybe i can get that taken care of
well welcome to the best thing that's
ever happened to you
and probably me too it's called coffee
with scott adams it's the highlight of
civilization
and um
i think you're all glad glad to be here
but if you'd like to
take it up a bit
um how would you like to enjoy this at
the highest possible potential and all
you need is a couple of micro glass
attacker challenges time i can't take
jugger flask vessel of any kind but
put your favorite
beverage in there
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better
it's called
that's right
the simultaneous
go
does anybody feel their internal organs
uh operating a little bit better now
i think so i think they're working
pretty well now
well uh instagram reinstated me
so i had my account locked for reasons
unclear
but it turns out
that they do look at their appeals and
i'm back online so i don't know why i
was
banned and i don't know why i'm back
actually
but it all worked out
um it probably doesn't hurt
that i tweet about it
do you think instagram noticed when i
tweeted about it
because i've got a feeling i did two
things
one is instagram has its own little form
you fill out if you think you've been
if you think you've been banned unfairly
so i did that but i also tweeted about
it and at instagram
and my experience has been
that if you have a big enough account
and you tweet at somebody your customer
service problem gets fixed really
quickly
so
so i don't know what happened but it got
fixed well i set a new personal record
for expense to fill up my gas tank
at the pump yesterday i spent 116
dollars to fill up my
car that is a new record
and the pumps had to be apparently
reprogrammed to handle over a hundred
dollars they used to cap out at a
hundred dollars
116.
so thank you joe biden
rasmussen has a uh
poll about
what americans think of ukraine and
zelensky
uh 76 percent of americans bold say they
had a favorable view of zelinski
is that kind of
says seem high to you
who in the world has 75 support
for anything
but zelinski does in america
and uh 76 of the u.s public thought that
russia has committed war crimes
uh that leaves it roughly 24
24
24 rounded to a quarter
let's call it 25
think that russia has not committed war
crimes
in a war
okay
and 72 percent of the american public
thinks ukraine should keep fighting
and not trade any land for peace
well
i just about threw up when i saw these
uh statistics number one
we are easy to manipulate
we are easy to manipulate 76 percent
support zelinski
really
do 76 percent of you really know what's
going on even
do you know who backs the lenski or why
do you even know what country he's
actually
i don't know i mean
i'm not i'm not going to say i have
anything bad to say about him
necessarily
but you do know he's a completely
artificial creature right
he's a he's a creature of
manipulation and propaganda
why do you trust these polls
well that's the next thing i was going
to say
um i think that a poll like this
is highlighting that the americans are
watching this like a tv show
unfortunately until the stuff starts
blowing up in america
if the only impact i see is at the gas
bump and i you know blame biden for that
or inflation or something i don't really
see any direct connection to the war yet
i think it's it's coming
um but i think we're watching it like it
like it's
entertainment
does anybody else have that like
gross feeling
that we're being entertained by war
because we are
you know that that's that's literally
what's happening
um
and i feel creepy about it but at the
same time
it's a major war how do you not talk
about it
so
i would just say this
um
you know there are no good guys in this
war
have you heard one story yeah i guess
you heard one story about
ukrainians doing war crimes against
russians
the one where they're shooting them in
the legs which is horrific
but do you really think the russians are
doing more war crimes than the
ukrainians
i mean i guess the difference is there
are no
russian civilians in ukraine
um
yeah
all right well obama visited the white
house to make joe biden look especially
bad and he he succeeded admirably
so obama was there to celebrate
health care improvements that he made in
his office
and did you see the videos of joe biden
wandering around and nobody would talk
to him because everybody was talking to
barack obama
it was pretty sad
he
literally just looked lost
and and he put his hand on obama's
shoulder to get his attention and obama
just ignored him
like the president of the united states
has his hand on your shoulder
and obama ignored him and just kept
talking to who he was talking to he
ignored the president of the united
states well i guess you can if you were
one maybe
but that was all sad and pathetic and
whatever you thought of
of obama as a politician
when you see the two of them next to
each other
oh my god the contrast
say what you will about obama but he was
a great communicator still is
and watching that next to biden is just
devastating
um you know the the purpose of having
this kind of a visit is to get democrats
excited because they've got this
enthusiasm gap that's like a million
miles wide
if you just judge by the enthusiasm to
vote
gap
republicans will win everything
but things could change
i think that this visit backfired
if i had to say i would say the benefit
of highlighting the health care got a
little bit better according to democrats
the benefit of highlighting that when
it's not as salient as it was
when you know first obamacare happened
i don't think that's going to pay for
itself if you put biden and obama next
to each other in the same photo shoot
because now it just shows you
how degraded
blindness
so i think they came out behind on that
amazingly
well the durham investigation has uh new
information
now there's
some document i think it was an email
which does show that the lawyer who is
working for hillary clinton and the
democrats in the 2016 election
did in fact lie
to intelligence people and maybe the fbi
about who he was working for
he said he wasn't working for anybody
when in fact he was working for the
democrats and hillary and now it's in
writing
so
let me give you a little context of
what's happening now
here's the context
we know for sure
that there was a massive collusion
between intelligence agencies
democrats and the media
to
paint trump as a russian
colluder
which he was not
and
and it didn't change the
it didn't change the election enough for
trump to lose which is amazing if you
think about it it didn't change the
election enough for trump to lose
but
looks like they took a better run at it
and
you know i i can't
i can't help but think that the january
6 insurrection narrative
is just the same play
where the the democrats come up with a
ridiculous narrative
but as long as they can get the
intelligence people
the democrats and the media to say it's
true
it's true for long enough to affect the
election
it's true for long enough
so it doesn't matter if it later becomes
you know debunked completely as it will
the january 6th thing was clearly not an
insurrection
and and to imagine that you thought it
was an insurrection
as opposed to a bunch of people wanting
to make sure the system worked
the way it was designed that's literally
what they wanted they wanted the system
to work as it was designed
that's all they wanted
they weren't even asking for a different
result
were they
okay
i mean there were people who wanted a
different result but they weren't
demanding it
they were demanding a process which
would give you some clarity about who
actually won
that's what they demanded some clarity
they only wanted clarity
that's it
and it got turned into
an insurrection
well one of the most amazing things
that's that i've seen happen while i was
watching it
so now we've got the
the media intel and the democrats they
they gave us the russia collusion hoax
they gave us hunter under biden's laptop
was russian misinformation and it wasn't
and they're pushing the january 6th
insurrection narrative
three clear examples of intel democrats
and the media
intentionally colluding
to create a story that isn't true
to influence
politics
somebody says there are more than three
i'm sure there are i mean those are the
three that are at the top of the news i
literally just took the three top news
stories minus the ukraine war
and i've got three three examples of
massive collusion
now i'm not going to say that the
the republicans have never had some
you know i i
trust me i'm not the guy who says fox
news is always right cnn's always wrong
i don't see anything like that
nothing like that at all but what i
don't see
is the
the right-leaning part of the country
doing anything like this
am i wrong can somebody give me an
example
of where republicans colluded with
intelligence agencies and the right
leading media to create a
narrative
there probably there probably are some
examples right
seth rich maybe i get i guess you get oh
iraq or interesting iraq war
yes that would be actually that's a good
example now you have to you have to go
back a ways
how many years ago was the iraq war with
weapons of mass destruction
how many years ago was that 2002 so 20
years ago
i'm not sure that that's as relevant as
it is today
pizzagate interesting
i don't know that pizzagate was ever
embraced by the
right leaning media though was it
i don't recall that
that was more of a social media thing
all right
um so now here are the here are some of
the things that the
media
and the democrats have gotten away with
so russia collusion hoax hunter laptop
just
fake disinformation hoax january 6 as an
insurrection
the fine people hoax the drinking bleach
oaks
and that's if you were to design the uh
the contours of politics in 2022 it
would be hoaxes
it's all hoaxes
it's like our entire landscape of
politics is literally hoaxes
which is weird
yeah oh yeah the don't say gay things is
a hoax essentially
so here's something here's an experience
i had that other people had and i want
to see how many of you had so in the
comments tell me if you've had this
experience
i want to order groceries with an app
i use doordash could have been some
other app but i use doordash
and they go to my local store safeway
to get things and then they bring it to
me and on paper that sounds pretty good
doesn't it
isn't that a great idea
use an app to say what groceries you
want and then they just show up it's
pretty amazing
do you know what small
just a small little
let's say error or imperfection in the
system is it's just a small thing
but the app
doesn't have access
to what supply the individual stores
have
so you can order all kinds of groceries
and then your person will go to one
store only
and that one store doesn't have a third
of what you ordered
a third
a third of what you ordered
of a fairly long list
now the first several times this
happened to me
i thought it was because of supply chain
problems or
i thought it was a fluke or i thought
the person shopping for me was bad at
finding things
as of yesterday i can confirm
that the app is not connected to their
supply information
safeway literally sells you they
don't have
and then to make it worse this was my
experience yesterday
so yesterday i didn't have dog food
i had only treats that's why i was like
giving her treats and waiting for my dog
food to come
so i didn't have dog food like i'm not
going to go all night without feeding my
freaking dog right
so i use the app
goes to the wrong store doesn't have the
dog food
as my groceries were being delivered
for the price of sixty dollars extra on
top of the groceries
because i tip i tipped well so for a
sixty dollar tip
twenty percent of a 300 or so you know
dollar thing
for sixty dollars i still had to drive
past my delivery guy as he was coming to
my house i had to drive past him to go
to the store
to buy the he didn't get
so far every time
every time i've used a delivery service
i still have to go to the store
do you want to know how it's worse
there's an option that they give you for
substitutions
and they say if we can't find this would
you like to substitute that i write in
the comments no substitutions do you
know why
because they will text you the entire
time they're shopping
and they won't stop
well i can't find this cream cheese
would you like another
the reason i'm using the app is
because i don't want to
do the work my self i pay 60
dollars for the delivery of the food
because i don't have the time
and from the moment you send in the
order
until the moment they arrive at your
door they don't stop texting well we
don't have this would you like this we
don't have this would you like this now
i say to myself
i'm going to beat the system
so i say to them
i write the notes no substitutions and
so therefore i won't get what i want
but i also won't spend the hour that i
was trying to avoid do you know what
they do
when you say no substitutions
they text you and they say
well i'm just asking about this one
and i think
all right juan
i'll answer one text okay i'll say no
substitutions
and you think now that you've said it in
the notes and now that you've answered
one with no substitutions
you think
well now they're not going to text you
again
well about six texts later
one every 10 minutes during the same
hour i was trying to take a nap
do you know why i didn't go to the store
myself i was so tired i didn't think i
could drive there
literally i didn't think i could stay
awake to get to the store
i tried to nap and every five to ten
minutes they texted me
and here's the thing
if you don't answer the text
you're not gonna get your food
because they won't do anything or
they'll cancel it or something if
they're not getting responses
so the whole food delivery business is
completely open for um
conquering
this is a gigantic industry
and imagine that there's no it's not
being serviced
you can still get stuff from restaurants
about
i would say my door dash uh
ratio of working if i have stuff
delivered is
three out of five it works
well if you order food for delivery and
let's say there's at least two of you
so there are a number of things
how often do you get the exact thing you
ordered
about
about 60 of the time right
something like that somebody says 25
it's very unusual to get what you
ordered
now think about think about how bad
these systems are they're still being
wildly used
so if there's one thing i could tell you
about how to decide what kind of
business to go into
find a business that everybody wants to
buy even though the business is terrible
like cell phones
do you remember the first smartphones
they were terrible
they were terrible
3g
dropped every call
i had at t when i had the first
smartphone they couldn't even make a
phone call
literally i bought a phone
that couldn't make a phone call that's
not that's not a joke
the att phone with the antenna problem
um with the iphone you just you couldn't
even make a phone call
with the phone
ever
i completely stopped using the phone i
just texted it after that for years
i think two years are just texting
because the phone never worked
and yet
smartphones are enormous market because
every one of them it's the same thing
with grocery delivery let me tell you
what's wrong with groceries
first you
pick your food or whatever and you put
in a package and you put it in the store
and then somebody has to go get it and
then they put it in the bag
and then they
bring the bag home and they unload the
bag they take it out of the bag and they
put it in the refrigerator and then take
it out of the refrigerator they take out
the packaging there's like 50 50 steps
to get you your food and they don't all
seem so important
so anyway the point is that the entire
food industry
i think will be reworked because there's
plenty of market opportunity
well here's an opinion from on the
ukraine war from phillips o'brien
he seems to have some credentials for
talking about this stuff
and he says
that the russian army might be in worse
shape than imagined
and he goes on parenthetically to say
and i've probably been as skeptical
about their condition as anyone since
this started
but he says it looks like putin doesn't
trust forces that were not sent to
ukraine in the first place
so here's what he's saying
there are two narratives about what's
happening in ukraine and we can't really
confirm either one right
but they're too number one is that the
russians uh are
moving forces away from kiev
because it's all part of the master plan
to degrade the ukrainian army in general
and having done that now they're going
to consolidate forces in the places that
matter the most around don bass they'll
conquer that they'll consolidate it and
then they'll expand back into ukraine
which by now would be so degraded that
it would be an easy job so that's one so
one is that kiev was a decoy
to get the ukrainian army you know
distributed and then degraded
here's the other one
the reason that russia needs to send the
same military that got whacked around
kiev
is because they can't send anybody else
meaning that they don't have fresh
soldiers that they trust
think about
that that if russia had fresh
soldiers
that's the according to military people
they would send the fresh ones into the
south
because the last thing you want to do is
take an army that just got the ship beat
out of it and send it directly into
another fight
because
because you don't want to send a
a crippled army into a fight because
sometimes there's not much difference
between the the last straw
and being an effective military there's
like a just a little bit of a tipping
point
if you've got a degraded
army
you might be pretty close to the tipping
point and not know it
um
so
so one possibility is that the the fact
that the uh the spent forces from the
north are being used in the south
is desperation
so two narratives
uh putin definitely has everything under
control and it's largely working the way
a military would conquer a country just
you know and they're and they're doing
uh shaping the battlefield and shaping
the war and they did that now they're
gonna
mop up the don bass and they win
that's one but the other is that they're
in desperate situations
and uh they don't have reinforcements
and the other is that um i also read a
piece i i wish i had written down who
wrote it
but apparently the
and i'm not sure i believe this
that the russian military is designed
for a nuclear fight and not a standard
one
in other words the tanks
can't even stop machine gun fire
have you ever heard of that that a lot
of the tanks used in ukraine
were developed for a nuclear situation
so i guess they withstand nuclear
radiation fairly well
i don't know that that's possible
but they're
but you could actually machine gun a
tank
and
and if you do it hard enough long enough
you can actually penetrate the tank with
machine gun fire
now that's what somebody says
and they showed pictures of tanks that
were reinforced because the armor was so
light i don't know
i've seen lots of people saying that's
not true
not true not true it did sound a little
weird that the tanks would be optimized
for a
uh nuclear
confrontation
all right well a lot of you don't
believe it i'm gonna say
uh
there might there might be something
true issue about it but
i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't accept it
just because i saw a tweet about it
all right so your skepticism is uh well
respected
um
and then also summer's coming so when
the leaves are on the trees in ukraine
it looks like that could be a big
strategic advantage for the locals
because if you're an insurgency group
your benefit is hiding
and they can just hide better because
there's going to be leaves on the trees
what happens when winter comes
if ukraine holds on until the winter
what happens then
and i've said before that the
how things go in ukraine is entirely a
uh there's only one number that matters
which is the number of drones i think
if they get enough switchblade and and
the real good ones that uh are even
better than switchblades switchblade
plus
if they get enough of them
i would think that they win
am i wrong
who would agree with the following
statement
that there is some number of switchblade
drones that would allow ukraine to win
outright
yes or no now this assumes there's no
tactical nuclear strike or something i
guess
but yes or no
it's only about the number of
switchblade drones
if they have enough
they win
no some people say no
yeah i mean when it comes to war i don't
think anything's predictable
well a lot of people are saying now
interesting
um
wow there's i was not expecting so many
people to say no to that
so i don't quite understand why you
would say no to that
now i'm not saying that they will get
enough
that's a different prediction
i'm saying that if they got enough
they're apparently not that hard to
train somebody to use right i didn't see
anything about training being a big
problem
yeah and why haven't drones gotten into
moscow i do have that question i assume
that the ukrainians don't want to look
like the bad guys
you know they're managing their
reputation so they're not attacking any
uh any kind of
um
you know civilian center
all right yeah jamming is a thing but
you can get around the jamming as well
all right uh
here's my take on
the war
i think everybody would agree
that the invasion was is on putin now
it's also true that the united states
and nato did lots of things
which invited this attack
but you don't really blame the victims
if somebody attacks you do you
even if you say well nato and the us did
some provocative things
is that justification for war so it it
takes the takes the blame away from
putin
i don't think so i don't think it works
that way i think your victim can do
everything wrong and it's still it's
still the aggressor's fault
i mean that's just the way things work
but
um i'm going to revise this in my
opinion
i think starting the war in ukraine was
100 putin's fault
continuing the war in ukraine after we
see that there are massive war crimes is
the fault of the russian people
now i know it would be hard for the
russian people to overthrow putin
it's also their job
lots of people have hard jobs
lots of people have
difficult situations
and i'm not minimizing how hard that
would be and how many people would die
if they tried to do it
but
uh let me talk directly to the russian
people
you're letting never again happen
again
all right
this is on you
this is on younow
putin can start a war and if it was fast
he could finish it
but it wasn't fast
now it's on you
so russian citizens
you do know how to get real news
you do know how to find out what your
country is doing there
you do now it's on you
you so the new the new holocaust is on
the russian people in my opinion
uh putin of course is guilty but because
the russian public
could if they rose up as one really get
anything done
but they're not
there's a little protesting nothing
nothing important
so somebody says it's on nato i think
nato made a mistake
i'll give you that
but it would be a mistake to wear uh
provocative clothing in a dark dangerous
neighborhood wouldn't it
wouldn't that be a mistake
wouldn't it be a mistake for a woman to
dress provocatively in a dangerous
neighborhood that's you know where
there's no law
of course it would would you say then
that if she is assaulted
completely her fault
is that your view
that the the victim is at fault for
creating a situation which invites the
crime is that your view
because that's not my view my my view is
that the aggre the person who commits
the crime is always
to blame period
now i would
here's where i would make the
distinction
nato was stupid
but putin's to blame
will you buy that
nato made a mistake
you could you could argue they made a
mistake by being too provocative
i think nato made a mistake but
putin's to blame
he's the one who did the bad stuff that
caused people to die
and bad analogy
well take any analogy you want
when do you when do you blame the
victims ever
victims can make mistakes and victims
can do things that make it more likely
that they're victims they can definitely
do that and i would call them out for
that
as i have called out nato for you know
creating a situation where the victims
would happen
but this is on the russian people now in
my opinion
so if you're a russian citizen and
you're not doing something about this i
have a problem with you forever
forever
and
uh
i think we have to start moving the
you know moving the frame
because putin isn't going to change his
mind but the russian people might have
something to say about it
all right
let's talk about elon on the board of
twitter elon musk
so do you think that elon musk will have
access to the algorithm directly or
indirectly do you think you'll have
access to find out
what's going on there
or does a board member not have that
kind of
access
who thinks that as a board member that
would be enough to actually get into the
engineering
because normally that would not be
enough right would you all agree with
that
normally the board member would not be
digging into anybody's engineering
so normally it wouldn't happen the only
thing i know is that when i tweeted
about it
musk liked the tweet
so when i tweeted that
that elon musk would get access to the
algorithm and that that would be
glorious
he liked to tweet
so do you think that elon thinks he can
get access to the algorithm he liked my
tweet saying he would
i feel as if he wouldn't have bought
nine percent of twitter
unless he had a strong indication he
could get into the
parts he cares about because otherwise
it would be a waste of
billions of dollars and he doesn't
really look like somebody who wastes
billions of dollars
so he must have had a strong
inkling or even maybe a direct possibly
a direct
some kind of direct agreement
that he could get into the details
now what's going to happen when he does
now i noticed
before i looked i looked to see if elon
had uh liked or tweeted retweeted
anything that i said because my number
of users
climbed by about 20 times
after after we found out that musk might
get access to the algorithm
the number of people who
followed me went from
around 100 a day on average
to over 2500 i think
in one day
now people said it's because elon musk
liked my tweet
but but when he just likes a tweet i've
never seen that move my needle before i
think he's liked my tweets before i've
had famous people like tweets
but i don't really see it moving the
needle
so here's the first question i'm asking
and because because uh musk did like my
tweet i can't say anything for sure
about it
because that could have been the only
reason that the numbers went up but i'm
going to keep a look at it keep watching
it
the only reason i checked that stat
because i don't it's not one i follow
the only reason i checked my daily
number of new followers
is that i imagined that if there's
something sketchy going on with the
algorithm
that the people in charge of it are
actively rewriting it right now
you know what i'm talking about
that if there was something sketchy
about the algorithms
the engineers who are in charge are
quickly removing the evidence because
musk is getting too close
am i right now i'm not saying that's
what is happening
all i'm saying is that i expected it to
happen and when i checked the numbers
were exactly what i expected what
happened
because it does look like my account is
suppressed in some way but of course we
all think that right
it's easy to have you know confirmation
bias or on that
so even though it feels like my account
was being suppressed in terms of growth
i couldn't be sure
so it's what i'm watching
and now that i've talked about it in
public it probably ruins the experiment
because who
knows
so as anybody else had the experience
that as soon as the
news came out that musk was going to be
on the board of twitter did anybody see
that their daily number of followers or
even their engagement
went up dramatically did anybody see
that
because if you didn't
then i would guess that the only thing
that's happening is that because musk
liked my tweet it got a lot of attention
although i looked you know before i
um i did look to see if he had liked it
or anybody important and i didn't see it
but somebody said he did
somebody says my engagement is way up
i find this a very strange place for
scott to press in his heels especially
since we're in the prop
still in the propaganda war so you're
talking about my ukraine take
what exactly did i say that's not
obvious
was there anything i said that's not
really obvious about the ukrainian war
okay
well let's talk about inflation and
experts
um as you know
there are many professional economists
do you think the professional economists
are all in uh agreement
about how bad the inflation is and what
it will take to get it under control
of course not
of course not
kevin says you missed the 2014 context
you mean uh
vaden and uh
crimea and all that no i'm not missing
any of that context
we're all aware of 2014 and crimea and
the maiden movement and all that and i
do think that
nato and the united states
have a lot to explain in their in their
strategy
um
you appear to be pro-ukraine
not really
uh i i'm starting to hate everybody
meaning that i don't have any trust for
zelinski whatsoever
i'm sure the ukrainian military has
committed atrocities
do you know why
do you know why i'm sure the ukrainian
military has committed atrocities
because it's a war
it's a war
you can guarantee it both sides
both sides commit atrocities and war and
there's i don't think there's any
exception to that really
if anybody's going to argue with me that
one side does war crimes and the other
one doesn't
uh
no
i mean that's just so simplistic i can't
even imagine anybody would have that
opinion
so i don't i don't think that the
ukrainians are more pure than the
russians
i don't think that they're less evil i
do think they have a that's a nazi
problem maybe not as big as some say
i'm not sure i love any of them
not really
so i do think that you can't have
countries conquering and rubbling
neighboring countries
so i have a if you're saying that i'm
pro-ukrainian let's say i'm
anti-attacking your neighbor
would you call that the same
so i'm very much against attacking your
neighbor
which is i feel like that's different
than being pro-ukrainian
although if we're talking about the
citizens i'm pro-ukrainian citizens
uh as i was until recently i was
pro-russian citizens but now i think the
russian citizens have uh
they've fallen into complete disrespect
at this point
let's put it that way i say the russian
citizens are victims as well but i've
lost all respect for them i can't
respect the russian citizens for not
doing something about this
and i know it's dangerous but that's why
you respect people right you respect
people when they do dangerous things
that have to be done among other reasons
but if they don't do the dangerous
things that need to be done i don't
respect them and i don't think you
should either although that's of course
a personal decision
um so let's see we've got uh the paul
krugmans and the larry summers and
jason furman and other famous economists
and they don't seem to have a common
opinion about whether inflation is going
to lead us into a recession or be
no big deal in the long runs
what do you think
one view is that
we've never been in this situation
without x happening
but
an x being you need a recession to get
out of this basically
um but i don't know anything is
predictable do you remember
are any of you old enough some of you
are to remember stagflation
the idea that your economy could be soft
at the same time inflation could be
rampant
and the economist thought well that's
not even possible
the thing that makes inflation usually
is a hot economy and stuff like that
shortages because you have a hot economy
um
so
i think my general statement is that
economists don't understand inflation or
what to do about it
is that
is that too strong
i mean i remind you that i have a degree
in economics i'm not i'm not guessing
entirely
i'm guessing a little bit but to me it
looks like economists can't do inflation
it just seems to be beyond their ability
if if they could then all the smart ones
would be on one side
and maybe some dumb ones would disagree
but
scott aping the msnbc cnn genocide line
have you seen the pictures of the rubble
now i haven't said genocide have i
somebody somebody's saying that i'm
aping the
mainstream media genocide line have i
used the word genocide has anybody heard
me use that
i haven't used that word
do you think that a lot of civilians are
getting killed
you idiot
i mean seriously
i don't need to use your words so that
you can have something to debunk me with
i'm going to use my words
russia's killing a bunch of civilians
deal with it
that's just the truth
do i think that ukraine has done bad
things yes
absolutely
and i don't find that one of them more
morally
correct than the other really
you know if you're looking at individual
acts if you look at any individual
citizen they're fine
just like everywhere everywhere right i
don't think you can go anywhere and find
where all the citizens are bad
i doubt it
all right
um
here's so let me make my prediction on
inflation i'm going to give you my
contrarian prediction
well here's here's the problem
that everything that's happened so far
is because of surprises
am i right
you know a lot of people didn't really
think there would be a big war in
ukraine although a lot of experts did
predict it i'll give them that but the
general public didn't expect it i don't
think
we didn't expect the coronavirus
there's just a lot of stuff we didn't
expect so probably that's what the
future looks like too a whole bunch of
stuff we didn't expect
but given the
coronavirus in china and everything else
i think the supply chain problem is
is pretty gnarly and it's probably a
five-year problem
what do you think i think we have a
five-year major adjustment problem and
one of the major adjustments will be
building uh different manufacturing
facilities
especially for chips
can you get a chip manufacturer up in
five years
if let's say mexico wanted to build a
chip factory could you spin one up in
five years
probably
probably three to five right
that's what i'm thinking
um
so i'm going to say that we've got a uh
three to five year problem
and that at the end of it we're going to
have a better supply chain
far more robust
so
you know the bad news good news
situation is we're going to be in way
better shape to handle the next pandemic
am i right
i mean i think we learned enough from
this pandemic except for the masks
i don't think we learned anything about
masks
but basically we're in better shape i
think for the next pandemic
and i think the same will be true for
supply chain
issues we had a really weak supply chain
it turned out we didn't know it because
it didn't get stressed but as soon as it
got stressed it just fell apart
but human ingenuity plus three to five
years fixes just about everything
um
scott has never heard of austrian
economics
okay
why is there a shortage of chips if they
come from taiwan
do they
um
china makes chips too right
and and i think there's also a raw
material thing
all right somebody uh wants to fix my
analogy oh this will be useful
let's argue about analogies
ah says your analogy you would attack
your neighbor that has threatened you
your way of life
with the help of a bully
you would attack your neighbor that is
threatening your way of life with the
help of a bully that is what russia did
well okay
oh the base materials come from china
but the chips come from taiwan somebody
says
that's interesting
so in other words china and taiwan do a
lot of trade
you know i never wondered about that
so
china and taiwan do a lot of trade
i assume i mean i've never heard they
don't
that's sort of an interesting situation
isn't it
all right
um
raw material sand
well you need more than that don't you
i don't think the raw material is just
sand is it for silicon
china makes a lot of chips too but not
as much as you now i don't really
understand why
chip manufacturing went to asia can
somebody explain that
wouldn't chip manufacturing be the
ultimate example
of something where low
assembly line workers are not useful
isn't it a pretty much automated process
plus engineers
somebody says not true
so
i i can't believe that labor cost is a
gigantic
uh
portion of chip manufacturing is it
am i wrong about that i feel as if you
could build an automated plant
designed by high paid engineers
they could make
make your chips with just a few people
carrying boxes around
am i wrong
epa regulations
is there a regulatory
reason uh environmental regulations well
but the machine could handle all that
couldn't it
i realized i real so is that why we
don't do it in the u.s
oh epa regulations
so it's a is it a dirty business is that
what you're saying making chips is
pollutes causes pollution
okay people are saying it causes a lot
of pollution
well
that's what mexico is for no i'm just
kidding i'm just kidding but apparently
if you're going to do it in a
in another country
with lower standards wouldn't you rather
do it in central america
wouldn't you
i mean i'm pretty sure we can find a
central american country that's
low environmental requirements
it might be evil to do so
probably would be
but it looks like it would work
intel does it in the us just fine china
just does it cheaper
okay
automated fabs in space oh that's
interesting so if you put a chip
manufacturer in space you get the
benefits of the of the environment i
guess
because no dust
interesting
um
all right
uh why are you laughing at never again
so there's somebody here who thinks it's
funny to put a
a never again in quotes with a happy
face
what is your point
i i i just have a problem with people
who mock a point without any information
about what it is that's the problem just
nothing
all right uh that ladies and gentlemen i
believe was all i wanted to talk about
today and i believe this was one of the
finest
48 minutes you've ever spent
and it can only get better tomorrow
now
let me ask you this are you hearing any
opinions from me that are
different or additive to what you're
hearing in the regular press
am i adding any value with
because sometimes i don't know
i just feel like you might be seeing the
same opinion somewhere so on locals i'm
getting mostly yes
thank you
moses uh
uh
talk about disney
um so i'm not gonna talk about disney
and here's why
uh
it just bores me
you know
disney's woke
you're too woke i don't know there's
just nothing there
now i suppose you could say it's a
you know it's sort of the battle that is
going to define the war or something you
know so maybe it is i don't know i just
can't get interested in it
i feel like the disney story is a
um
almost like a manufactured story
it isn't it's based on real stuff but it
feels like the the press loves a story
where no research is necessary
am i right
whenever i see a story that's reached
the the top of the headlines
one of the things i look for is okay how
hard would it be for the news industry
to produce more of these stories
no research needed
do you know why we don't know exactly
what's happening in ukraine
it's really hard to get news over there
to get like somebody on the ground who
can figure out what's going on and get
that news back here so we don't know
much about ukraine
so when you've got something like this
disney situation don't you think fox
news and the others just say oh this is
money in the bank we'll never have to
research it because it's purely opinion
never have to research it we can make
infinite stories because every time a
celebrity says something about it or
there's a little change it's a new story
so
i would suggest that if you think the
story matters
and you're not directly involved
probably you're a victim of brainwashing
and that's sort of what i'm resisting i
think that when i when i say i can't get
interested that's maybe not exactly the
best way to say it
i guess i i'm resisting being
manipulated into an unimportant story
because it's easy for the news to cover
it it's cheap for them to do so
did that make sense
the the the is i guess it's the
economics of it the economics of the
story say it's fake
because it's free
right when it's free
you worry about it
if i'd paid for it or it cost them a lot
of money to produce it i'd say well
there's something somebody put money
behind it must be some substance but if
somebody puts no money behind something
and they're just taking in money by
talking about it
your your filter flag should be
you know flying red
on that
so again i'm not going to say the disney
thing doesn't matter
it matters to a lot of them
but the entire narrative has turned into
you know don't say gay which is of
course a hoax so basically it's a hoax
versus people talking about a hoax which
is the very thing that the news industry
likes the most they want to get you all
worked up about a hoax
one way or the other oh i like the hoax
or i hate the hoax
but if you're arguing about a disney
hoax basically
you've really been sucked in
i mean you should feel manipulated even
if you care
you should feel manipulated by that
story that's that's the instinct i'd
like you to develop is that if it's too
easy for the news to do the story
that's a flag
right that's a flag
all right um
uh disney is opening a park in ukraine
you know have a never again land okay
that's
that's uh
an awful joke
not that i don't appreciate it
but it's awful
you know one of the problems with being
a professional humorist and i'll bet a
lot of stand-up comedians have the same
problem is that what it takes to amuse
us
you know since we deal with humorous
you know the
basically the the stuff we breathe all
day
what it takes to amuse an actual
humorist
is something pretty edgy like something
that would be painful for the regular
public
if the regular public would find pain in
the joke that would be just about where
i'd want it to be right
uh oh please explain humor to us father
scott
well
uh i can do that
uh
i i know you think that
people can't explain humor to you
but something like a third of the
country can't recognize a joke
i i've seen this my entire life doesn't
matter who's telling it a third of the
country doesn't have a sense of humor
just doesn't have one and they've been
faking it
like they laugh when other people laugh
but they don't get it
you bought your friends scott what's
that mean
a micro lesson oh somebody's asking for
a micro lesson on being charmingly
charismatically humorous i don't think
that could be taught
am i scottish yes i am
coincidentally
uh we love you but you're a
msm puppet for two years now
all right let's deal with this so
hauling
v hulling
says we love you but you're a mainstream
media puppet for two years now
who would like to agree with that
have my views match the mainstream
my views have not been anywhere near the
mainstream view
so
hauling i would suggest to you that
you've been
subject to another hoax
there's a reddit hoax
about me
i'll just collectively i'll call it a
hoax it's just a bunch of people talking
but collectively it's a hoax if you go
to reddit it will say that i was pushing
vaccines for the pharma
and the mainstream media
there's literally nothing like that i've
ever done
but on reddit is a fact
and a 4chan is a fact
nothing like that's ever happened in the
real world you can't find any example of
it
nothing you can you can't even
think of all the people
here's here's a test for you
think of all the people who
made that accusation
that i'm pro vax etc
have they ever produced a tweet
or a quote to back up the claim
not once
not once think about that think about
the fact that i'm completely
propagandized as
somebody who is super pro vaccine went
out when i was the opposite
and i wasn't fully the opposite as an
anti-vaccine but i was definitely never
a pro-vaccine for any of you
i only made my own decisions
so
so
what do you think about that now those
of you who are agreeing with statement
that i was supporting the mainstream
media and then you're hearing me say
that never happened
how does it make you feel to know that
all the people who think it did happen
have never produced a single quote or
tweet to support that opinion not one
not once in two years and you don't
think i've had thousands and thousands
of critics on that very point and not
one of them had a quote
think about it
let me let me ask you on youtube i know
that the locals people are
more more informed about what i have and
have not said but on youtube where
people are a little less
a little less informed about my opinions
does it give you any pause
does it give you any pause to know that
nobody's produced an example
to back up that theory about me not one
does it give you any pause
i just want to see if anybody
who had that opinion about me is is
rethinking it based on the fact that
nobody in two years has produced any
example
not even a bad example
i'm not even talking about a tweet that
somebody
thought said that but maybe it didn't
nothing like that at all
now this is where people start accusing
me of being sensitive to criticism
that's not really the point here
you get that don't you
but the context of my life is being
criticized massively all day long about
everything
i'm not arguing everything
i'm arguing one narrow thing and i want
you to only understand how easily you've
been bamboozled so this isn't even about
me
let me say as clearly as i can i don't
give a about your opinion
why would i
why do you think i care about your
opinion
i care
that you understand when you've been
brainwashed
that's my show
my show is about helping you understand
when you've been brainwashed when when
you're in confirmation bias when
cognitive dissonance has taken you
that's what i care about i'm not
defending against the criticism i'm
trying to help you understand that
you've been bamboozled that's all
now
anybody who thinks i'm sensitive to
criticism
did you stop or did you start watching
me just today
gets criticized more than i do and
nobody cares less
nobody cares less than i do
i don't even think about it like i go
through my entire day
being you know massively criticized
about everything on social media i don't
think i think about it once during the
day
i mean i think about it when i read it
this metal
now and and you can see from the
comments that people have watched me for
years that i'm not exaggerating
how much others have been brainwashed
about me
all right so much
there's a tesla giga texas cyber rodeo
tomorrow i don't know what that means
um
all you talked about was the vax for
like six months
that's not a point
that was the only news
the news stopped for two years it was
just like that's that if you have a show
that talks about the news are you what
am i supposed to talk about
it was like the number one question on
people's minds for two years is this is
this vaccination gonna help me or kill
me
so all right
uh the fact that i talk about things a
lot does not mean that you learn
something about my opinion
so he says scott you're being ridiculous
just own it
okay that comment looks like cognitive
dissonance
uh
the the all caps people are coming in
scott we all know you got duped by covid
because your friends scared you into
trying to save the world
time to apologize
well do you know how many lives i saved
personally
seriously you probably don't
but do you but literally do you know how
many lives i saved
now if you're a critic you'll say that's
ridiculous you didn't save any lines
but
i did
so we'll remove you because you're a
jerk
you assumed that novax equals death nope
and the quote that you gave to support
it doesn't say anything like that so
that's my example somebody just gave a
quote that nothing to do with the point
that they said the quote was about
that's like what my day looks like
normally
all right
uh because of your pro vac stand john
says
so
how many of you who have actually
watched me think i have a pro vac
stand go
in the comments now remember the person
who said that
you're all watching me
so
are in locals it's 100 now
let's see how many on youtube on youtube
it's a it's a different mix
right just watch the other people that
they've watched me too
and watch how they have a different
opinion about say
um
right
so your opinion of my opinion is wrong
as you can see from the other people
who've been watching me so does that
change your opinion
if you thought i was pro fax and now
you're seeing that the other people who
watched me
who watch probably more of my content
they say i'm not
does it does it affect you because
that's not me so me talking that's
people who have the same experience as
you
well
if you see the elephant in the room and
nobody else does that's a clue all right
too much about this too much about me a
little bit too self-referential i know
but
um
uh
okay
uh that's it for today and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
