just as soon as I send this message and
pull up my comments we're going to have
the best show
ever the best show of all time yeah
aren't you glad you're here imagine if
you'd missed it oh my God you'd feel so
mad at yourself
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that no human can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need is a cuper marar glass a tanker
cheler Stein a kinty Jugger flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dop being end of the day thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
oh better than
sex with somebody you don't
like all right here's all the scientific
news and then we'll do the fun politics
and how keris is destroying the
world we'll get to all that but uh there
are major report reports of zigzagging
UFOs in the Southern California
Skies so you know if you were a
UFO you would come to California
wouldn't you well there were lots of
people saw them there were six flying
sofs they were darting they were
zigzagging
now may I offer you
my very uh informed opinion if you see
some kind of light in the sky or some
kind of object and it's
zigzagging that's never an
aircraft it might be a balloon I suppose
it could be a drone but it's not some
full-size
aircraft right so credibility of this
report in terms of alien spaceships I
would say zero some said that it's in
the it's not too far away from some air
force or military testing thing so it
might be one of our military testing
things but it's probably just a balloon
in the air I reflection or a lie or
something I'll tell you what it's
not the least likely possibility is an
alien visitation from a a an alien
species that can control gravity in
physics I mean can't rule it out but it
would be said last on my list of
possible explanations for this
situation now I'm going to make this
next story tie back to the first story
but you won't see it coming right away
Second Story is Engineers have designed
Mi I guess MIT Engineers have designed
tiny tiny batteries so small that you
could put them in tiny tiny robots and
they're so minuscule that you could put
them in a like a cell of a human body
and then you could you know do things
like
uh deploy cell-sized autonomous robots
for drug delivery within your body so
imagine robots that are fully programmed
robots they're smaller than the cells of
your
body so that's
coming all right now watch me cleverly
tie it back to the earlier UFO story
what are the odds and by the way this
idea comes from Douglas Adams the writer
no relation to me what are the odds that
if aliens visited this Earth the aliens
would be approximately our
size it's pretty close to zero isn't
it well what would prevent the aliens
from being the size of these tiny robots
that are smaller than a human
cell could it be that there are vast
alien civilizations living on Earth but
the entire space that they take up is
like I don't know size of a
baseball but but you got like a million
aliens living there in their little
civilization and they're not maybe
they're not even entirely sure that
there's other people on
Earth so once you realize that the
assumed scale or the physical size of
aliens there's no reason it needs to be
your size I mean why can't the aliens be
the size of the planet so that the
planet itself is so small they wouldn't
be interested in it because you know
they couldn't do anything with it
they're too
big so there might be some Physics
reasons why things can't be too big but
apparently there's no physics reasons
why you can't make a robot that's
smaller than a cell in your body so I'm
worried about aliens that are smaller
than the cells in your body they may
already be here your body might be full
of aliens could be
all right scientists have also developed
a solar panel material that's a 100
times thinner than a human
hair and it's so thin they think you can
print it on other objects apparently
it's super efficient too they say so
super efficient um to yield over 27%
Energy Efficiency that's better than
regular uh solar cells and
uh it's only as thick as one human hair
well that tells you what I'm going to do
I'm going to uh put that on my human
hairs so I I don't have many but the few
human hairs I have left I'm going to
have it coated with this solar stuff so
I can charge my phone just by walking
outside without my hat that's my plan
that's my plan and by the way you might
need these tiny tiny solar cells because
yeah there may be an alien civilization
that's very small but living on my
scalp might need
electricity so I'm tying all the stories
together
now well there's a new book by David
stainforth and uh it's called predicting
our climate future and a big part of the
book is him explaining in smart detail
why climate models are
[Music]
 now should would you spend your
money on this book which I believe is
very smart sounding it would teach you a
lot or or save a few bucks and just ask
Scott because I told you that the
climate models are absurd I told you
that you can't predict the future
certainly of the climate there are two
things you can't do predict the
future and especially know if you have
all the variables right to even look at
predicting the climate so the the fast
version is there is no way to predict
the climate there are too many variables
it's too sensitive to any small
assumptions and it's
absurd now if you hear from me a
non-scientist saying um logically this
can't be done you're not going to
believe me but here's somebody who knows
what they're talking about has lots of
smart facts so if you want to learn why
you should not trust models that predict
the future of the
climate um this will tell
you Tucker had a uh two of the scarest
guests I've ever seen on the show um one
of them Dr Casey means who an MD was
talking about
how some combination of our food supply
and big Pharma is making all of us
metabolically sick and it's a massive
it's maybe the biggest
problem Maybe the biggest problem in the
world certainly in the United States but
just look here's some of the
stats autism rates in kids uh are 1 in
36
nationally compared to 1 in 1500 and not
so long ago in California it's worse
autism rates are one and
22 if you have a kid in California
there's a one in 22 chance that the kid
will be
autistic one in 22
what 74% of American adults are
overweight or
obese that sounds about right I if I
walk down the if I walk down the
sidewalk once you get to about age
30 yeah I'd say
75%
um 50% of children are overweight or
obese oh my God 50% of American adults
have pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes
50% 50% of adults have either diabetes
or pre-diabetes
30% of teens now have pre-diabetes 30%
of
teens now pre-diabetes means you're
you're sugar is high but you don't have
diabetes but you're you're pushing on
the border of it
uh infertility is increasing at 1% per
year per year every
year and sperm counts are are decreasing
by 1% per year since the
1970s young adult cancers is up
79% and what is causing all this it's
our toxic food system and toxic
environment now some of it may be
related to lots of pharmaceutical stuff
in your veins maybe individually every
bit of it is okay I don't know but when
you put it all in there maybe it's a
little too much for your body I don't
know same with your environment there
are lots of things that are a little bit
pollut but if you were to look at them
individually they wouldn't look so bad
but what if you have a thousand of them
that are all a little bit pollut and
they're all over all the time
so the uh the worry is that we're on
this uh fast road to not reproducing and
being so sick that we spend 100% of our
money just trying to stay alive so
that's the bad news and by the way this
should be the number one issue in the
country RFK JR says it should be I agree
with him completely the weird thing is
that all of our other problems look like
they have something like a solution
but this is the one that I don't see the
solution because we're not exactly sure
where all the problem is coming from I
mean even if you say it's food or even
if you say it's big Pharma drugs you
don't know which ones and you don't know
how to get rid of those things too
easily so I mean I don't know what to do
about
it but uh I will tell you that um I'm
going to I'm going to pile on a little
bit I want to see if any of you have had
this say same reaction and I'm talking
to mostly the men all right because men
are more
visual I think it does apply both ways
but let's just keep it simple question
for the men I've said this before but I
want to see I want to see your
opinion it used to be in let's say I 10
or 20 years ago that if I left the house
and went to any public space where there
were a lot of people around there would
definitely be a lot of attractive women
in that place not as a percentage maybe
but if you had a you know big area there
would be plenty of really attractive
women just because they were a
percentage of the
population now you can go for a long
time in a very big public place without
seeing anybody that you would want to
have sex
with has anybody noticed
that cuz I used to walk around thinking
like I couldn't even go to the mall or
the supermarket I'd be like okay I would
do her I would do her yeah I'd probably
do her okay I'd let her do me you know
and like you never turned
off I know this is appalling to
women but men are pretty much always
searching even if we're not actively
looking for any kind of sexual activity
we're always scanning you know you can't
turn off the scanning but the scanning
is completely turned off now I don't
have that EXP experience when I go
anywhere it's just people now none none
of them are triggering me
whatsoever so is that just age could be
but it does look like people look
different to me so reproduction is
probably going to take a big
hit but here's the good news all right
you ready for the good
news there's a groundbreaking study on
age
reversal and there's some kind of a telr
uh drug that they're giving to dogs that
are having
Miracle uh effects one of the examples
was a 12-year-old German Shepherd now of
course this is anecdotal and you know
it's not a it's not a scientific study
so you can't put too much credibility in
it but it's a fun story and the story is
that their 12-year-old German Shepherd
had terminal cancer just you know
nothing you could do about it but they
gave him one of these pills and cancer
went away and now he's just like a
puppy do you believe that do you believe
that there was a a dog that was
basically flatlining and they gave it
one pill and now it's like a puppy and
the cancer went away I don't
know I don't know it seems a little bit
more that I'm willing to accept as
automatically true but I'm going to put
this in my recreational belief
category I like to believe some things
because makes makes me feel good so
until it's proven not to be true I will
recreationally believe that I can give
Snickers a pill next year and she'll be
like a
puppy I think it'll take a few years
before it gets to any any approval
process but
maybe well the Harris campaign is hiring
and uh one of the requirements is you
must be up to date on your covid
boosters so imagine how hard it would be
to hire
if you had to get people who are up to-
date on their Co
boosters there're also Democrats who
support
Harris and almost certainly the Dei
filter is on as
well if you said we're going to hire
people but you have to put these three
filters on you got to you got to get
diversity you got to get a Democrat who
likes Harris and they got to be fully
boosted and
vaccinated now without saying anything
negative about any of those
groups wouldn't that constrain your
options to the point where you
guaranteed incompetence in your campaign
and the answer is yes and again it has
nothing to do with anybody's genes or
lifestyle or or even their
Democratic views on life none of it it's
just that when you put those three
constraints on a a normal thing that
normally wouldn't have constraints
hiring people you're just painting
yourself into a little corner there so
what we should
predict is massive um incompetence from
the campaign now you might not see it
because whoever is the top top advisers
I think are really good and again
independent of whether they're diverse
or not they're very good so we can if we
treat them as individuals and not part
of a group there's somebody really smart
advising her I I I will uh say that
confidently
and uh here's another funny stat that's
so funny it makes you cry uh Breitbart
News is reporting a Warner Todd Houston
at Breitbart News the nearly one in
three Chicago School
teachers keep their kids out of public
schools let me just say that
again because I don't have to add much
commentary to it one in three Public
School teachers in
Chicago don't send their own children to
public school now do you think that one
in three School teachers come from a
family where they can easily afford
private
school I I don't know who the spouse is
but I would guess if onethird of
teachers are sending their kids to
private schools that might represent
100% of teachers who can can afford
it see that's not in the
statistic statistic just says one and a
three but once you say how how expensive
is private
school and how much does a teacher make
in Chicago you kind of quickly reach the
assumption that 100% of the people who
can afford to get their kids out of
their public schools have
already done it the people who know the
most the
teachers if they can afford it they
pulled their kids right
out is there anything else you need to
know would would you like to answer some
questions about the the uh teachers
unions do you see the problem it's
always been the teachers unions because
if you can't fire a teacher you can't
have good teachers if you can't have
good teachers you don't have good
schools if you don't have good
schools and you can afford it you're
going to spend your send your kid to a
good school if you you can afford
it it's all
here there there's no questions left
unanswered by the
statistic this answers all questions and
what it says is there's nobody on the
other side of the
question think about that there are so
many things in this world where people
you know could be on both sides
reasonably even the people who know the
most the
teachers are on the same side as you are
which is huh this system looks totally
broken you better get keep your kid out
of
it
wow well as you know Comm Harris has
proposed a uh government
$25,000 for first time home buyers to
help them buy a house I saw Mark Cuban
is doing some persuading on this showing
it's a good idea and when I looked at
his analysis all I could U conclude is
that ordinary people should not be
allowed to do economic
analysis now Mark cubin is very smart
but doing an economic analysis is a
little bit different than just being
smart that it takes a little bit of
experience that even smart people
wouldn't know they're missing something
so I would say that while I conclude
that Cuban is very smart in in lots of
different ways um I don't think he's the
one you would look to to analyze this
now I'm not sure I am but I have been a
lending officer at a bank so that that's
a pretty relevant uh experience it
wasn't mortgage lending but there there
are some
overlaps and here's what I say in
California
$25,000 well let me put it this way
here's the way I posted
it where I live if I were the loan
officer let's say I'm the mortgage
lender and somebody comes in and they
say here's my here's my application for
the loan and I look at it and it doesn't
qualify and so I turn them down so they
go back and they get their $25,000 from
the government and they come back in
they go look I get now I got extra
$25,000 how often would
$25,000 change my decision as a mortgage
lender what do you think $25,000 that's
a lot of money right how often would it
change my decision to say that this
lender wasn't qualified before but now
they are qualified the answer is
never the answer is
never zero there wouldn't be a single
extra loan I gave if somebody didn't
qualify before the 25,000 there's no
 way that I'm going to think that
$25,000 is going to make that a safe
loan there is no way that $225,000 makes
a difference because if you're that
close to not being able to pay off the
loan no Banker is going to give you the
loan if you're that close to the margin
of not being able to pay back the loan
are you kidding
me 25,000 is like a you're pissing in
the ocean in California now I will I
will revise this to say that there may
be a part of the country where if you
could
get maybe a condo for
250 the $25,000 starts sounding
substantial at that point but still if
your income was only just enough to pay
the mortgage if only you had that extra
25,000 it doesn't sound safe to me
sounds like you're right on the margin
and the slightest disruption in your
employment makes you in
default that's just uh so that's some
perspective from A lender
if you're just looking at somebody who's
not a lender and they're just crunching
some numbers for you and say oh look
here's somebody who could save some
money with this $25,000 thing that's the
wrong
analysis the analysis should be from the
commercial lenders perspective because
they're the ones who decide if you get
the loan so how about this how about you
tell me if CNN or MSNBC will have a
mortgage loan broker on and then you ask
the question hey how many more loans do
you think you'll make if people get
25,000 for their first home
buy let's see what they say that at best
they'll say something generic like well
you know more money is
better I don't but if you ask them how
many extra loans they'd make it'd
probably be close to
zero all
right part of that plan apparently is to
uh exert some federal zoning control
over the local areas in other words um
there there's some part of what they
want to do with lowcost housing this is
different from the $25,000 thing so
separate but related uh they want to
make it easier to
build homes basically and one of the
things that they would do is exert some
kind of federal zoning control over the
local places I saw a video um from some
probably Republican a woman who was in
the business and she wanted you to know
that it's a terrible idea for the
federal government to tell States or
localities what to do with their zoning
because the federal government would not
know what they needed more specifically
locally does that sound like a good idea
to you do do you buy that the right
place for zoning is
locally you shouldn't
because what happens is they all do
different jobs and and and they're all
they all just they're all Rogue so if
you have different zoning requirements
in every town like we do like if if I
I'm walking distance literally walking
distance from different zoning
requirements walking distance I mean
literally if I just walk in in that
direction I'll be in the town of
Livermore in you know 20 minutes or
something and and the the rule rules are
different now you try to hire a
contractor and they have to like learn
the new rules for your town even if
they've already built 100
homes and and our town has like some of
the strictest dumbest
ones let me just give you one example
here's one example from my town when I
built my house I had to put a wastewater
treatment Vault on my property you've
never even heard of that have you how
many have you ever heard of that the
putting a
wastewater treatment Vault on my
property what did it cost about $35,000
 dollars and what it was was a
hole in the ground where all the all the
waste waterer so we'd engineer the
gutters and stuff so all the rainwater
would come off the roof and go into
little tunnels and it would all end up
in this big hole in the ground at the
end of my property and then there would
be a tree
a certain kind of tree that had to be
planted so that the roots of the tree
would be naturally filtering the
Wastewater before it got into the town's
Wastewater
facilities
$35,000 and maintenance every
year now a few years later when I had to
do maintenance on it as required by the
approvals for my house I went to look
for somebody who was like an approver
who could look at it and there was
nobody there was nobody in the world who
was in the business of approving it or
examining it and yet that was a
requirement of building my house so I
contacted the town and I said there's
nobody in the business of doing the
thing you required me to do and they
said oh don't worry about it we don't
have that requirement
anymore and I said what they said yeah
yeah we dropped that requ requirement
that's no longer in the codee and I said
I just spent $35 th000 to do
this how many other people spent $35
 thousand to do it and they said
I think it was just
you so do you think that I like Federal
Building control yes I do yes I do
because I think the feds are far far
more likely to come up with a stable set
of rules now of course they might have
to modify it for your climate and you
know your specific situation but I could
easily imagine the FED having let's say
half a dozen different models that you
could pick from for your building thing
in your state that would just be easy to
understand and wouldn't have in
it like I mean it was just monstrously
difficult to get approval from my house
of the Town monstrously difficult and if
you looked at any of the any of the
individual things they were asking for
they were all
defensible individually everything they
asked for was defensible it's just that
collectively it made it almost
impossible I was thinking the other day
about you know every now and then I
think about starting a business usually
I'm just playing around in my head but I
think what if somebody started a
business and did this hey what if I do
it and I realized that there's no
situation in which I would ever start a
business in
California just think about that I've
started a number of businesses in
California they didn't all work out like
my restaurants but I would never start a
business in
California so I I'm done economically in
my
state I I don't know how I would start
it in another state exactly what that
would look like but if it were a local
business that had to be in California I
wouldn't even do it it wouldn't matter
how good the numbers looked like if I
ran the spreadsheet and it was like wow
this is like you know making tons of
money here I wouldn't do it because it's
the wrong state to be in
business so so that's got to
matter well the all-in Pod
podcast um we're not so happy with KL
Harris's uh grocery price gouging uh
price control idea because everybody
who's smart and let me say that not as
hyperbole everybody who's smart knows
that price controls are devastating for
civilization it's like an end of
civilization plan it's so bad it's not
like other things where we go oh if you
do this there might be some trouble you
know the usual political stuff you know
everybody says if you if you elect Trump
it'll be the end of democracy but you
know nobody takes that too seriously
except idiots but when I say that price
controls could be the on food specific
land food could be the end of
civilization that's not
hyperbole if you run into of food
everything falls apart so and and price
controls would guarantee that you had
less
food now that
doesn't doesn't say there's 100% chance
is the end of civilization but in terms
of your real risks it's way up there as
one of the the biggest risks to
civilization and I can't even believe
that is being proposed I mean it's
actually mindboggling now I have not
heard a single person in favor of it yet
so the reason I like to refer to the
all-in pod people is because they're
unusually smart and
unusually uh big Talent stacks and
they've seen a lot of businesses and
they've succeeded in a lot of businesses
and they invest in a lot of businesses
so they're the ones who if you get all
four of them saying this is a bad idea
because remember they don't all agree
politically but all four of them would
say from a business perspective I think
I think all four of them are on the same
page um this is not a good idea it's a
terrible idea to have price controls on
food there's a uh video going around I
think it was from maybe 2019 of KL
Harris talking to some crowd and I don't
know the context I think the context is
lacking but she was talking how you the
government could snatch the patents from
companies now the Contex must have
been companies with really bad
behavior so I don't know why she' even
talk about snatching their patents but I
saw people forwarding it around and
talking about her being a patent
snatcher which I love to say by the way
you patent
snatcher that might be that might be my
new insult for
everybody you little patent Snatcher
I I love saying that say it at home
you'll like go ahead say it at home say
it at home to your dog if there's nobody
else there just say it out loud and see
how much you enjoy saying patent
snatcher it sounds like it's going to be
naughty but then it's
not you little patent
snatcher anyway here's my point about
that everybody was talking about how bad
it would be if she um if the government
tried to snatch your patent
and uh they buried the lead you know
what the lead is she was obviously
drunk if you see the the video I think I
forwarded it on my ex account but you
can see it easily just look at it and
ask yourself if she's drunk you'll see
it immediately why in the world is the
story that she's going to snatch your
patent when the real story should be
there she is drunk again I mean
obviously drunk it it's you don't have
to be some kind of expert
in in drug abuse to know a drunk how in
the world is that not the Topline topic
all the
time I guess no proof no
proof and the the tell is you have you
ever known a uh a woman who when she
drinks too much she has a extra high
pitch voice sometimes have you ever seen
that it's such a tell where you be
talking long and maybe you're quite
animated but then your voice will go up
to this level that it never goes up to
unless you're drunk you know somebody
like that I know you do uh just listen
to it and when she hits that high note
you'll be like ah yeah that's her her
eyes look drunk and her demeanor looks
drunk but when she hits the high note
you're going to say to yourself yeah you
don't talk like that unless you're
drinking meanwhile Brazil as you know is
trying to censor the xplatform they came
at him
again and mus has uh stated that uh the
Brazilian attempt to censor free speech
in this country on X which would also be
in their country because X is there uh
violates Brazil and us
laws now I hope that's true I hope it's
true that it violates Brazil and US law
because otherwise what the hell is X
going to do they they can't just stop
so what's going to happen let's talk
about the rest of the world Germany said
it's going to cut any new military aid
for Ukraine meaning that I guess they
got some money that's already committed
that they'll continue to give but
they're not going to approve any new
money for
Ukraine Brazil do you think it has
anything to do with the report that
Ukraine blew up their
pipeline well it probably didn't
help probably didn't help at all but
if Germany's not going to pay for
Ukraine and we
are is that because Germany has no money
left or they don't think it's important
if Germany doesn't think it's important
why do
we so certainly raises a
question um meanwhile you know that the
EU commissioner Ty Breen
had War he keeps warning X that if they
violate the European Union standards for
speech which would be anything hateful
uh or I guess disinformation too in
their view uh that they would ban X from
operating in Europe now if you're
tempted to say so what we don't care
about Europe Europe collectively is
bigger than the United States so there's
no multinational company that can really
survive losing Europe Europe it's just
too big of a market now survival is
probably too much of a statement but it
would be tough for somebody who's you
know some huge part of their business is
Europe to Just Lose It suddenly so the
stakes are really high but interestingly
the US House Judiciary Committee uh is
going to back ax and musk and they went
after uh EU and basically the the US
House Judiciary Committee and is this
comr might be Romer um they basically
wrote a Stern letter to the EU and
said get the out of
here they they use bigger words more
more official sounding but basically the
US just told them to leave us alone uh
you know in very Stern words now do I
like that yeah yep thank you United
States there there is my government or
at least you know hopefully at least the
Republicans my government defending me
against uh what I would call an attack
by
Europe to me it's an attack if you come
after our Free
Speech what do you call that if you try
to block free speech in America that's
an attack I'm not going to call it not
an
attack oh Jenny we got a drunk in the
comments Jenny's pretty drunk
Jenny I'm hoping you can sleep it
off see this is where the all caps
really helps because Jenny's been
drinking an all cap yelling at me and
even if I say you're drunk and using all
caps it won't make any difference her
next message will be an entire paragraph
in all caps I'm not going to read it
Jenny I'm just going to see your all
caps and say never
mind but you just keep drinking and
commenting because something good will
come of it if you just keep it up just
keep it
up anyway um my view on the EU is if
they want to censor X we should stop
funding
NATO because if Europe is going to
attack us and try to take our free
speech um I don't think Putin would so
let Putin take as much of Europe as he
wants if he doesn't go after us if
Europe is coming after me I'm not going
to defend them I don't want to pay for
their defense in Europe just because
Putin might absorb Europe and then come
after me I don't think Putin can absorb
Europe because it's going to be
Islamic
so there you
go um so as you know the less you see of
a comml Harris the more popular she
becomes um Politico is talking about the
uh conven coming next
week um but they're talking about how
she's slowly rolling out her proposals
and not giving much detail about what
she wants to do and that uh the other
Democrats are are kind of happy with
that because they're they think that you
know more General approach works
now I hate how much I agree with the
Harris campaign on their
strategy it really is it's bold to not
have any
details and I hate that it's right I
hate that it's right but they're totally
totally in the pocket on this meaning
that they understand that the news is
just bad for
everybody anytime you do an interview
all it does is produce negative talking
points and so even talking to the
friendly
press there's just no there's no upside
now once you see that even the de
Democrats see that the news doesn't work
for them that there's no upside that
news is just looking for something to
criticize or at least the other side is
looking for something to criticize that
instead of running on
policy who would win if the if the
conversation came down to policy who
would
win well the top three or four policies
that the country cares about Trump is
way ahead in him being the one to handle
those you know immigration economics War
I
think so the Democrats know that they
can't compete on policy so the more they
tell you about policy the worse they'll
look because it's just stuff to
criticize but if they just do General
things like hey you're a Democrat right
well I'm a
Democrat are you awesome you are awesome
yeah you are awesome I'm a Democrat too
what do you think of me you think I'm
awesome
too why don't you vote for me what are
my policies what's the difference you're
a Democrat I'm a Democrat you're awesome
I'm awesome don't you aome more of that
so that's what that's what the Harris
campaign is running on and again it's
actually freaking genius it's genius
because I don't think anybody else would
have seen it that you could just ignore
the press and ignore putting out policy
details the the fact that they saw this
that in a sense was always right there
to be seen but they're acting on
it now you might say to me and this
would be reasonable that they don't have
any choice because if they put her in
front of the camera it's going to be
disaster but the fact that they embraced
it fully that they have a candidate who
can't talk to the press in any reliable
way and they're just running with
it I I I can't tell you how impressed I
am at the skill and wisdom it would take
to pull this off I don't like it I'm not
you I'm not in favor of it from a
perspective of a citizen but wow it's
just really
impressive
um there's a poll uh MRC NewsBusters as
a poll it's
exclusive and says most Democrats don't
know about Harris's radicalism so not
only do they not know about what
policies she wants to do if she gets
elected They al also don't know about
her past statements about
radicalism um and uh what
percentage see when asked about 10
different aspects of Harris's public
record on issues from let's say the
green New Deal abolishing ice
eliminating Private health insurance so
these are things she said in the past
which she does not Embrace at the moment
so that that's the first thing you need
to to know it's not her current plan but
it wasn't very long ago that she said
these things and that is important
because that tells you where her mind
was very recently and people don't
change that much but
uh between 71 and 86% of the Democrats
and independents said they had not heard
of Harris's positions or when it were
unsure so they've got to the point
where something like three4 of the
Democrat voters don't really know much
about the candidate and these are really
important things to know you should know
how Marxist she's been just a few years
ago that seems pretty important so
between the news not being real oh and
here's the funny part and then they
asked these voters who didn't know
anything about Harris where they get
their
news here's the embarrassing part so now
that we've determined that you don't
know anything about the candidate
running for president
uh where do you get your news and the
top answers were ABC CBS and NBC or
cable CNN and
MSNBC so can can we conclude that
watching the news makes you
dumber it literally does watching the
news literally makes you dumber now
there's not one of those not one of
these
topics did I see on the news I'm sure
they've been on Fox news but I don't
remember seeing them there there every
one of them I learned on
X so everything I know about K Harris's
past was on X and lots of times you know
it's all things I've seen multiple
multiple times every one of them but I
didn't see it on CNN or MSNBC or ABC or
CBS or NBC so if you watch those sources
you're in trouble and even if you're on
X I still think you're going to be in a
silo so I imagine the Democrats who are
on X are also not seeing it but I see it
all the time because I'm in a different
Silo anyway here's what i' here's my
question if there was a child in your
Universe let's say your own son or
daughter and that child was young and
they hadn't learned much about history
and they wanted to know about the United
States let's say they're N9 or 10 years
old how would you explain our election
system
would you say well we've got this system
where people learn about the candidates
you know they run for office the news
reports everything about them then these
citizens use their judgment and then
they decide who they want and what
preferences what preferences they agree
with and then they vote then whoever
gets the most votes oh no it's not
whoever gets the most votes it's the
electoral college but just a detail now
would you describe it that way in the in
2024 for CU I wouldn't be able to do
that if you if a young child who had not
yet learned it in history ask me what
our system is I would say well on the
surface it's this pretend Republic thing
with voting what it really is is a
massive propaganda
operation um in which one propagandist
side he goes against the other the
propaganda determines what the voters
think and that that automatically makes
them vote a certain way so then the
10-year-old would say so so it's about
voting I'd say no no you didn't listen
to me the voting doesn't matter at all
the voting follows from the brainwashing
if you get the brainwashing right the
Voting is just automatic so the Voting
is the least important part of this
process is just the the final part the
most important is the brainwashing so
what we have is a political system in
which the people who are most successful
at brainwashing rich people the media
Etc uh they they brainwash the citizens
to make them think that their vote
counts but really it was the
brainwashing that counted the voting was
just the final way to know that the
brainwashing worked that's how I'd
explain it that's my literal honest
completely honest opinion of our system
it's just a brainwashing operation
whoever does it the best wins why did
Trump win in
2016 the brainwashing didn't work he
broke through he he was an
iconic unique character in history who
could penetrate the brainwashing just
long enough to get an office and then
the brainwashing got stronger and drove
him out of office
basically all right uh interestingly The
Washington Post is not backing kamla
Harris on her price control idea huh
let's see if I can understand this The
Washington Post owned by Jeff
Bezos who also owns Whole Foods a major
Food grocery store KL Harris wants to
put price controls on
food which would be presumably terrible
for Whole
Foods and then for the first time ever I
don't remember seeing it the Washington
Post came out strong against the
candidate
now not against the candidate but
against her economic
plan and uh it an opinion piece in the
Washington Post called it a Mis
misguided idea and a
gimmick and even over on CNN they're
saying it creates more problems than it
solves do you remember when I told you
that there would never be an economist
on CNN or
MSNBC unless they were planning to kill
the plan
no Economist has come forward none to
say that kamla's ideas are a good idea
think about that how many how many
economists are
Democrats
50,000 I don't know
20,000 how many how many professional
economists are also
Democrat it's a lot right C if C if NBC
can find one
that says K Harris has a good economic
plan just one
anyone my prediction is nope unless they
find somebody who's clearly batshit
crazy and and when you listen to them
you go okay that barely sounds like an
economist to me maybe but I don't think
so I think they're just going to have
the pundits talk about it because the
pundits are not experts so they can just
say well it sounds like a good idea to
me but I don't even think any of the
pundits say it's a good idea just people
on the
campaign so I would say that the price
controls on food idea might be the worst
idea I've ever heard in the American
politics well the uh DNC Democratic
National
Committee uh will be uh in Chicago
starting Monday for four days and uh
stores are already closing down and
boarding up their
Windows well they're not closed but
they're boarding up their window windows
and they're planning to be closed
because they expect so many protests and
violence from Democrats by the way or at
least people who are left leaning it
looks like the um the pro Palestinian
protesters are likely to show up in big
numbers now what's that going to do to
America it I I think the more the
Democrats are seen by regular
Americans as being part of this you
know
Palestinian
anti-israel push it just it looks all
bad to me so it could be that this might
be the first DNC uh convention that did
a negative bump to the
candidate so what you usually expect is
the convention gives an automatic bump
to every candidate doesn't last but an
automatic
bump maybe it'll be different this time
I'm not going to make that prediction
because it's so consistent that you get
a bump from the convention
but this one could be
different if what we watch is every day
things catching on fire in the streets
of Chicago and we say to
ourselves but aren't they
Democrats if if you if your brain says
those are Democrats destroying Chicago
during the DNC I don't know that KL
Harris is going to get a bump so this
one will be
fun um fun in a bad way I mean I
wouldn't want to be a shop owner in in
Chicago I feel sorry for them but we'll
see this this might be a surprise
meanwhile Corey leowski is back on the
Trump campaign team there is some um
some confusion about what his role would
be some said he'd be the boss of it and
he wouldd be the boss of WS and Lita who
were getting a lot of uh getting a lot
of criticism from
Republicans but apparently his formal
titter is senior adviser so that would
be not so obvious that he's in charge so
it could be that uh he's just added to
the group it doesn't mean he's
necessarily in charge of them but he's
coming in with a lot of clout so maybe
in effect he will be I don't know maybe
maybe somebody will be leaving soon but
doesn't want to say it yet so I would
say this is still Fogo War so anything
could come out of
this uh Biden is saying and an aios is
reporting that uh that Biden thinks he
might get a Gaza deal by the end of next
week
really
really this is in the news somewhat
uncritically in the news that he's
expecting there's a good chance of
getting a getting some kind of a hostage
deal and maybe a ceasefire in
Gaza you all know that's not going to
happen
right do I have to tell you that's not
going to happen you all know that's not
going to happen but why is the news
treating it like it
might what is up with that now here's
why it's not going to happen uh there's
been news that apparently and who knows
how much you can believe from a war zone
but something like more than half of the
Hamas Fighters have been
killed but if you've only killed a
little more than half that leaves a lot
of Hamas Fighters why in the world would
Israel agree to any deal about
anything until they knew they could get
all the rest of them remember their
slogan is total
Victory is that
ambiguous there's nothing ambiguous
about that Israel said we're going to
change the situation forever in Gaza
and that we're going for total
Victory if you interpret that as we're
going to stop when we're halfway done
and let them
reconstitute well you're crazy you're
crazy now here by the way just in case
you're new to me I'm not giving you my
opinion of you know right or wrong or
you know who's at fault or what should
be done I'm just observing it I'm just
I'm just looking at it and when I look
at it total Victory is not anywh near
where they are and they have the ability
to drive much closer to Total Victory if
they keep
grinding why would they
stop I mean I I I don't even see the
logic of the story much less agree with
it so I'm going to give you my
prediction no there will not be any deal
in Gaza next
week I doubt you'll see anything before
the election I mean I'd be
amazed so don't get too excited about
that uh weirdly retail sales were good
in July although you should be warned
that they're more often um revised down
than up so it could be that re retail
sales were not as great as the original
numbers they might be revised down but
they're really solid so even if they're
re revised down they're you know sort of
directionally pretty
good but here's the question I ask how
much of that is inflation
if the only thing you know is that the
dollars that people spent for stuff was
a little bit up and inflation was let's
say 1% up on
average wouldn't that account for all of
your increase in retail
sales I'm not even sure it's good good
news because you know inflation doesn't
usually show up within one month or so
much like that but maybe I mean if if it
was summer and energy went up people
used a lot of gas you know you you could
imagine a situation where uh the re well
is gas retail
sales does gasoline count as retail
sales food food would right food and
gasoline would both be retail sales I'm
not sure but I the the question you
should ask is does it get
revised is there something about the
summer that's special but they they
controlled for the summer effect so it
shouldn't be just the fact that summer
that shouldn't be you shouldn't have to
worry about that uh but how much of it
is just inflation you can't really
tell Washington the state was ranked the
most dangerous state to live in for
2024 according to a study from wallet
Hub that's where I go to get my studies
wallet
Hub who who knows how accurate that
study is uh you know I always say that
all data is is fake but uh Washington
state was ranked the most dangerous
State um and the other states uh that
didn't rank well would be
uh let's say uh Oregon Colorado
California and what they call other
Democrat controlled
states that that might be a little too
political to just say it's Democrat
controlled States but clearly there are
some democrat controlled states that are
higher in crime
now
um did I say this or did I post it I'm
having one of these moments
where I can't remember if I already said
that this morning or I planned to say it
and it was so developed in my mind that
I can't remember if I said it or just
thought about saying it you know one of
those situations so I'm going to say it
again and you could tell me if I said it
already
live I'm in a weird situation living
here in what should be a safe
neighborhood in California
because three of my neighbors in the
last 18 months or so have had uh what we
think are South American organized
burglars inside their
house inside their
house gangs I mean a gang of burglars I
don't know if they're part of a bigger
gang but I've actually went from a
situation where I thought it would be
rare if my house got robbed so 10 years
ago I was said I mean anything could
happen but that would be really rare if
you know burglar if a team of burglar
are actually inside my house like that
would be pretty rare do you know what I
think now now I think it's
guaranteed I I've actually adjusted my
thinking that I live in a house that at
some point and it won't be very long
there will be a band of burglers in my
house and I've simply accepted that as
my new new reality
I do not think of it in terms of the
odds of it happening or not happening I
think of it as a guarantee I believe
every house in my
neighborhood will have a band of
burglars in it looking through all your
stuff and taking what they want at least
once now could I be wrong well I hope
so I I sure hope I'm wrong but every one
of those burglars got away with
it are you with me
three burglars three homes nobody got
caught why would they
stop why would they stop there's no
reason they they apparently have some
kind of a business model that works
great and if they did stop they just
replace them with another bunch of
burglars
so when I look at you know Washington
state where it's the most dangerous
place to live that might be but I
actually living a reality where in my
view there's 100% chance that someday
there will be burglars standing in my
house and they will be very dangerous
people now the only thing that I'm
hoping for is I won't be in the
house
well yes or
no yes or
no I hope I'm not in the house but they
better hope I'm not in the house too so
yes or no
but I'm accepting it will be a fact
anyway Trump has vowed to slash us
energy cost in half by making America
energy independent again let's compare
this plan to Kam
Harris All right we already talked about
her plans that even the Washington Post
doesn't like what do you think of the
idea of slashing US Energy costs by
making America energy independent again
which basically is removing
barriers I think it's completely doable
when when you look at this claim and
remember Trump is the king of hyperbole
so overclaiming is ordinary for him is
that an
overclaim it doesn't feel like it it
really doesn't feel like an overa I
think he could reduce energy cost by 50%
supply and demand why why does Trump's
plan look as aggressive as it is why
does it look like it could work and
probably would work because it properly
understands the free Market it properly
understands the free market that's it
that's the whole that's the whole story
and when KLA Harris comes up with the
plan it
improperly understands human relations
and motivations and incentives and the
free market it's really just that simple
if you don't understand how a free
market works you do all the wrong stuff
if you do understand like Trump
everything he says makes
sense here here's 's a little test for
you what did Trump do in his first term
that didn't make sense on
paper I can't think of anything now like
any presidency there are things that
might not work right in the real world
good ideas don't always work there's
always some hidden problem but name
something that Trump came up with any
kind of plan that he actually
implemented in in his first term that
didn't make sense on
paper I don't think there is one but you
look at KLA Harris's plan and literally
it doesn't look good on paper if you're
reading the Washington Post being a
paper yeah so this is really
different um when Trump says he's you
know the Republicans are the party of
Common
Sense
vaccines you're saying that vaccines
didn't make sense on paper
well if they weren't mandated they might
have that might have been a better
argument yeah so the trouble with
vaccines I don't want to get into that
conversation is that we're all smart in
hindsight if you put yourself in the
situation that he was
in it looks pretty different in
hindsight we're all
Geniuses anyway um 24 attorney generals
I think they're probably all
Republicans um are moving to secure the
2024 election according to
rsbn
um and that uh they filed a motion of
the Supreme Court to stop non-citizens
from
voting is that really a
problem how many of you think that the
number of noncitizens who
vote is going to be a big enough number
to make any
difference because I think we're
conflating it with the issue of having
mailing ballots for non-citizens which
somebody else fills out they harvest
them and fill them out now that would be
big enough the the number if it's
true that the noncitizens are getting
ballots mailed to them
automatically that would create you know
hundreds of thousands of ballots that
somebody could
Harvest now that's a big problem but how
big is the problem of an illegal uh an
immigrant
who wants to vote but is not
legal I feel like that wouldn't be huge
because if if you came to this country
the last thing you want to do is break a
law that doesn't matter to you because
you know that your one vote isn't going
to change anything right let's say
you're illegal immigrant and and let's
say you think you can get away with
voting so you're thinking I think I'll
give it a shot your one vote's not going
to make any difference but it put it
might get you deported
right if if Trump doesn't say uh I'm
going to deport first any immigrant who
voted you're first in
line why doesn't he say that by the way
Trump should say that when we do our
Mass
deportations first we're going to get
the uh the dangerous criminals to the
extent we can identify them so we'll do
the dangerous people first and then our
second wave will be anybody who voted
illegally because we can't have that
disruption in our
system I think America would say all
right well maybe we like or don't like
the deportations but if you're going to
do it in that order that does make
sense so you might not like the whole
thing but the order of it would make
sense get rid of the violent ones first
and then the ones who voted now I think
you could take the
risk of them voting down to to not
important you know wouldn't wouldn't
change any swing
state but the risk of having ballots
that they could have voted and having
hundreds of thousands of them in one
swing
state that's the whole election right
there so I don't know if the attorney
generals are doing something that would
have an impact on the availability of
the ballots but that's the whole game I
think it's not whether they actually
vote
all right
uh uh the house oversight committee oh
this is uh comr I knew comr was in the
news the house oversight committee led
by comr is investigating all the ties
that wals has to communist China Daily
wire is reporting that um do you think
that's fair and legitimate and good that
the government is investigating walls
because of his many connections to China
I have a bit of a mixed feeling about
that on one hand it raises every red
flag in the
world and certainly you don't want to
elect somebody who's number two who's
who's owned by China so yes it's
important but it looks a little like
looking for a
crime are you okay with that are you
okay with your government not seeing a
crime but if they dig around enough they
might find one
are you okay with that because that's
not a standard you want to apply to
you I've got I've got a little problem
with it now it seems to me that if
there's any kind of
uh if there's any kind of an
investigation it should be done by
wouldn't it be the
FBI if the FBI thought that there was
foreign influence on an American um an
American politician isn't that their job
to look into it now if the FBI were
looking into it because it's just an
obvious thing you'd look into and they
just sort of do their behind the scenes
investigation to see if there's anything
to worry about I feel like that's more
legitimate because to me that does sound
like what their job is it's like oh
we've got a suspicion of the worst thing
that could happen you know Chinese
influence over an American potential
president and sure they should look into
it but I don't know if anybody else
should
I'm a little concerned about anybody
else looking into that unless they don't
trust the FBI I suppose I don't know I'm
not terribly comfortable with that but
uh Tim wals has uh started his Tik Tock
account and uh Tik Tok of course is
owned by China and how long will it be
before we find out that his account on
Tik Tok is seemingly
boosted in some magical way that we
can't
explain I expect that
I got a question for you lawyers who are
watching I know we got a few lawyers
watching I want to see if you agree with
General Michael Flynn who says he
believes that Trump will be sentenced to
prison next month on September
18th uh he says uh you know why why
wouldn't they or why wouldn't he the
judge he says it's just more it's just
more of the same
so certainly General Flynn has you know
seen more of the dark underbelly of the
real world than most of us ever will I
hope because he's seen the darkest parts
of the government so when he says why
wouldn't they throw him in jail it's it
basically wouldn't even be outside the
scope of things that they're doing I
mean it wouldn't be that outrageous
given all the other things they've done
in context um but
lawyers do you lawyers think that he
would actually go to jail
or do you think that there would be more
legal process and appeals and he would
be out of jail even if he's convicted so
he might be
sentenced but does anybody think he
would go to
jail uh those of you how about those of
you who are
[Music]
lawyers so we think they'd try what do
you think would happen if he actually
spent a day in real
jail what do you think would
happen it would get really unpredictable
wouldn't it but it could be exactly what
the bad guys want it could be that some
of the more notable and influential
people would go too
far go too far in trying to correct that
situation and then they could arrest not
just Trump but a whole bunch of
influential supporters and just take
down the whole movement so it seems to
me like the thing i' would worry about
the most is that the real play is to get
the citizens more Angry than they would
otherwise and to get them to misbehave
in a way that you can put the law
against them and people will say well
you have to get the law
involved yeah I here's what I would say
if you're a
Democrat and you're in favor of this
and you're one of the people who can
make it happen here's what you should
consider things would get really
unpredictable now you know that the real
trick would be to avoid saying anything
that seems to promote violence so I
definitely am not promoting any violence
and I'm not suggesting any of you do
anything in that regard but it's easy to
say that the situation would be
unpredictable and it would be is so
unpredictable that nothing would be
ruled
out now I'm not saying that you should
do anything of those things that are not
ruled out I'm saying that in the big old
world there's a lot of people and
they're not all going to be on the same
page and they're not all necessarily
going to be 100% peaceful if they're not
getting what they want I don't recommend
it because it looks like a trap to
me but the Democrats have to know
that if you get into unpredictable
territory you can't complain if
something unpredictable happened because
you know you're opening up a level of
unpredictability that would be
unprecedented and at some point
unpredictability can turn negative
really
fast so I'm not going to make any
specific suggestions about what anybody
should or should not do in that
situation because that's the
Trap I will just say that would be a
level of risk taking that the Democrats
have never taken
before and that that level of risk-
taking would not be
wise can I say
that is it fair to say that given the
uncertainty of what would happen that
that would be a level of risk-taking
like we haven't really seen before and
there's almost nothing I would rule out
as something that somebody else might
think is a good idea in that case you
know I I certainly advise against all
violence no
violence all right um that's all I got
for
today it's Saturday so let's go and
enjoy our weekend it's going to be
awesome and I think the weather is going
to be amazing I think you're going to
have an incredible time it's already
started off so well
um but here's what I think I'm going to
give you one more
prediction you know that uh pill for the
German Shepherd that cured its cancer
and made it young again I mentioned at
the start of the
show I think there's some chance that
Joe Biden's going to take that pill and
by September he might look like a
30-year-old man and want to take it
back no I'm just joking but anything's
possible maybe you'll take the dog pill
um I'm going to say bye to exen rumble
and YouTube and talk to the uh the great
people
on locals who are my subscribers thanks
for joining everybody else and locals
I'm coming to you privately in
five
