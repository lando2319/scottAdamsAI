it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best
time of the day well it's fourth of july
the fifth we're celebrating like uh
demons here at the united states
our monday off even though it's not
really the holiday
and i would like to kick this monday off
with well really the best thing that's
ever happened to you it's called the
simultaneous sip and all you need is a
couple of micro glass
a tanker just either canteen jugger
plastic vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna rock your world now
go
ah well because
it's uh it's normal
it looks like my locals broadcast
is not working i told you there's a
problem whenever you have
any one piece of extra
uh extra technology this thing
is not working
and i'll show you why
so um there's a bad bad battery on one
part of my hardware
which is making this stream
not working so we're gonna end this
[Music]
all right the locals is turned off now
that was not a problem with the
locals platform i've been experimenting
with my various
uh different types of
sound equipment and one of them has this
fatal flaw that it takes the battery
what are the odds that i would be
organized enough
to have a spare battery all the time
to always have a spare battery and to be
able to hot swap it
as soon as i'm ready so this is a
problem with
almost all of the audio solutions
that i've tested so far they they all
have some kind of a
fatal flaw anyway so let's continue with
this
jonathan turley has a interesting
comments
about hunter's laptop have you heard
about
hunter's laptop
well apparently there's more and more
information that hunter was acting as a
conduit
for deals that would involve his
father's influence when his father was
vice president
and there's yet another story about this
coming out from
an ex-fbi director uh louis free
and i guess he made some donations to
the
uh to the some biden charity
and then ask for some business deals
now if anything like this had happened
to any of the trump kids or that family
this would be of course the biggest
story in the news
but this has every element to be a
gigantic national story
but it isn't it just isn't so the media
has simply decided as
jonathan charlie is pointing out here
they've simply decided this isn't the
story
and if you think that what makes a story
is the the elements of the story you
know the variables in the story is it
important to you is it going to matter
blah blah blah
if you think that's what makes a story
nope
it is not that is not what makes the
story
um and uh
all right just looking at your comments
for a moment there's somebody here who
wants
who desperately wants to get uh
banned but keep it up keep it up you'll
get banned in a minute
all right um corey bush
who is a congresswoman tweeted yesterday
quite provocatively
she tweeted when they say that the
fourth of july is about american freedom
remember this the freedom they're
referring to is for white people
this land is stolen land and black
people still
aren't free that came from a
congresswoman
she's black she's a woman
and she's in congress but apparently
something's holding her back
because what she's not president yet
she's not the emperor of the universe
what exactly is
holding back congresswoman corey bush
she's crushing it congressman
congresswoman bush um you're in congress
you did okay you did okay
so the weird thing is that i
of course agree with the statement
how many of you who are watching this
who happen to be
white or at least non-black how many of
you think this is unreasonable
is it unreasonable that black americans
would not want to necessarily
celebrate a day of freedom when they
didn't have any freedom
yeah i i feel as though
it's a perfectly valid point
however however
it also seems that everything should
have a start
because correct me if i'm wrong but
the original founders didn't let people
like me vote either did they
did they because let's say my family
were not
landowners actually we weren't here
during the
during that period but my so my family
wasn't here yet but
i suppose they had been and had not been
landowners
they couldn't vote right and if you were
a
poor person working for a rich white
person did they treat you well
or maybe he got beaten if you were a
poor white person too
so things were definitely not great for
everybody
but i think the point is well taken that
if you're black maybe that is not your
independence day i think that's a
reasonable point
i wouldn't disagree with that at all
but it's too bad there's not a date that
would have give us more unity on stuff
like this
speaking of race which seems to be the
only thing anybody cares about now
which is a really good sign if what
you're complaining about is race
in the united states in 2021
where race is the smallest problem
that's ever been anywhere
still a problem you know i'm not
minimizing how big the problem
remains but it is probably the lowest
that specific problem has ever been
anywhere
at any time that's my guess it's
probably an exaggeration but
you know things are heading in the right
direction at least so espn has this
racial drama and what makes this story
interesting
is that it's a story about nobody doing
anything wrong
except the people who reported it
it's a story about bad behavior except
there isn't any bad behavior
the only bad behavior is the people who
reported it because it was
based on a private phone call whoever
reports a private phone call without the
permission of the people on the call
they are bad people really bad people
but let me tell you what the what this
is about
so i guess there are two uh two women
who work
work for espn and they both
would obviously like to succeed in their
jobs
i'm sure that's a fair statement and one
of them's white one of them is black and
the
uh the black one
got some kind of a job that the white
one thought was guaranteed to her inner
contract
and then in a private conversation said
that
that what's behind it might be espn's
trying to correct for an abysmal
history of diversity now this was a
private conversation that somehow got
published
uh
which uh who who made who made a mistake
here
was it bad behavior by the white
um the white what are they
correspondents or what are they hosts
what would you call them whatever they
are the people on tv on espn
was a bad behavior that the white one
would say in a private conversation that
she believes that
her employer was being influenced by the
need to have a better diversity record
there's nothing wrong with that there's
nothing wrong with that at all
this was somebody accusing their
employer of good behavior
right because isn't espn supposed to be
trying to correct
their history of bad diversity
now i'm not saying that you agree with
it not not you individually
and analysts thank you analysts we'll
call them yes
sports analysts thank you and
but what's wrong with that what's wrong
with a white core
analyst saying that her employer is
concerned about
diversity and acting upon it
in a way that is good for diversity but
bad for the people who don't get the
jobs that maybe they would have if
diversity had not been a main interest
there's no bad behavior in the story
except whoever's the
who decided to publish a private
conversation
that's the only bad behavior in the
story and yet we're so starved for
race related stories that we have to
make this one
now most of you know i have a little
sensitivity to this because i lost
two corporate careers for being white
and
male and i hasten to tell you that my
bosses told me that directly
we're not going to promote you because
you're white
and you're male and we have a really bad
track record of diversity in senior
management
so we can't make it any worse by
promoting somebody like you
again they told me directly i'm not
interpreting
something i'm not assuming anything they
told me directly
this is the normal this is normal
everything you hear about this espn
story where there's a
white analyst who believes she lost a
job because of her race
this conversation is going on everywhere
all over
this is nothing about espn really just
the most
basic conversation happening in every
big corporation right now
so there's no bad behavior here and
nobody should be treated that way and i
don't even think that it was an
insult because some would take it as an
insult to the black
analyst because the assumption is that
she only got the job because of her
ethnicity but that's not even in the
story
because in the very story the white
analyst
is complimenting her and saying that
she's qualified
so you know it's not like somebody's
saying one of them is unqualified
that's not even in the story all right
we'll make anything a racial story even
if it isn't
did you see the clip of biden
in his declining declining cognitive
abilities
trying to buy something at a store and
also talk to people at the same time
it didn't go well it didn't go well at
all
and so is it rodney jackson
trump's ex doctor
at the white house is claiming or
asserting once again that
biden needs to take a cognitive test now
here's the interesting thing apparently
there is a scheduled medical checkup
before the end of the year
so we know the white house is going to
do that on biden before the end of the
year
don't you think they need to include a
cognitive test
it would be one thing if somebody showed
no symptoms whatsoever
of cognitive decline if people were
asking for a cognitive test
in the context of nobody asked nobody
noticing anything wrong
well you could you argue uh maybe we
don't need that
right but that's not the context
the context is that literally everybody
can see there's something wrong
with biden he is clearly slowing down
under that context how do you even argue
that a cognitive test is necessary
and i've got a feeling that the only
thing keeping it from happening
is that kamal harris is too weak and
they don't want her to be the president
i feel as if they realized that she
would be a
you know a nightmare as a president
so i think the democrats are in a bad
place they can't
they can't test biden's cognitive
ability
because i don't think they're going to
get the answer they want and
they can't not do it so what are you
gonna do just keep limping along and
pretending biden's
still in charge i guess so
so i'm trying to figure out what kills
more people
fake news or vaccinations all right so
here's a
startling statistic 86 percent of
democrats
and this is from cnn brian stelter's
show
so i'm sure the facts are all correct 86
percent of democrats
uh have one shot but only 45 percent of
republicans
did you know did you know the difference
was that big
86 percent of democrats have at least
one shot and only 45 percent of
republicans
now uh brian stelter blames you know
facebook and
fox for scaring people about the shots
and points out that generally
conservatives tend to be
more afraid of change and more afraid of
things but that doesn't seem to be the
problem here
the problem seems to be that
conservatives or republicans let's say
don't trust science they don't trust
science and they don't trust the news
so when when it's proposed hey get this
shot
the conservatives say i don't trust you
and don't get it
now i was looking at some of the
comments for why
why some republicans are not getting it
the most common comment
from people who don't want the
vaccination is it has a 99.9 percent
survival rate at least for people with
good health
now the anti-vaxxers say why are you
making me take an experimental
they would say let's say a not 100
tested vaccine when i already have a
99.9
whatever survival rate why would i take
that chance
what's wrong with that analysis go
tell me what is wrong with the analysis
that there's a 99.9 survival rate
uh can you tell me what's wrong with
that analysis well somebody says it's
selfish but
that's true you could define it that way
but let's just say you're making the
decision for yourself
you're allowed to be selfish when it
comes to your own health decisions
you could be selfish that's not immoral
all right yes i'm going to say long haul
that's right
if you're ignoring the long-haul risk
you have not made a decision based on
statistics
so don't act as though you are right now
if you said well i've considered the
long-haul risk
and very few people die from it and you
know worst case
i feel bad for six months i'll still
take that chance
well then at least you've made some kind
of a reasonable decision
you might be right might be wrong but
it's reasonable
but if you've ignored the long-haul risk
you're not making a statistical decision
what are you doing you're making some
kind of emotional decision
here's what i would like to see i would
like to see an
online calculator that shows you know
the various risks for various
situations so that you could put in your
own
long-haul risk can you tell
just off the top of your head can you
tell that your risk from the
vaccination would be worse than your
risk from not getting vaccinated
how would you decide that let me tell
you about a doctor you should not listen
to
so in texas there was some medical
doctors were
testifying before the state senate and
they were opposed to mandatory covet
shots but
they were talking about the risks in
general and i want to point out
a type of doctor you don't want to pay
attention to
okay so these are some things that this
doctor said
in uh testifying uh i think it was
dr edwards but it doesn't matter who who
said it
it's a doctor who said this he said on a
personal note
i believe that god gave us an amazingly
robust
immune system and i don't think we can
improve on god
that's a doctor you don't want to go to
if the only thing you knew about this
doctor was that one sentence
don't go to that doctor really that's a
problem
because this this doctor has told you
that he started with
his belief in god and then worked
backwards to his medical opinions
i don't see any other way to interpret
this started with a
religious belief and then worked
backwards to his medical opinion
i think he's saying that directly now
he also believes his medical opinion is
compatible with with god
but if you hear somebody start with
their religion
as that's my starting place and then i'm
going to tell you why my religion is
right just
run away and i'm pro-religion by the way
i'm not a believer personally
but a very pro-religion i think has all
kinds of benefits for people
that are unambiguous
um what else did dr edwards say
uh he said that dr edward stated that he
has received quote
numerous reports within hours of
receiving covet vaccines that people
have suffered strokes heart attacks
pulmonary embolisms blood clots
and sudden death if your doctor talks
like that
you need a new doctor if you ever hear
your doctor say anything like this
run away this is a doctor who's making a
decision
number one based on his religion you
said that directly
and number two based on anecdotal
reports
in a context where incorrect anecdotal
reports are guaranteed
meaning that so many people are getting
the shot
it's guaranteed that some people have
health problems soon after getting a
shot
guaranteed it doesn't mean that they're
all getting these problems because of
the shot
it's just guaranteed statistically that
you know x number of people will
will get the shot and then have a health
problem so
if he doesn't have a study to back up
these numbers
uh what the hell you know
at the very least you should be able to
back you know back up uh use
anecdotal stuff with a study
he also pointed out that a harvard study
excuse me has previously estimated that
only about one percent of all adverse
reactions to vaccines are ever reported
to the
vares database so there's this database
that people report any adverse reactions
and only one percent of them get
reported
but don't you think they report all the
bad ones
if if only one percent of the side
effects are reported
but don't you think all of the deaths
are reported or
heart attacks and stuff so i would think
it's probably pretty close to getting
all the bad stuff
the stuff that wouldn't be reported
would be a headache right
so i'm not sure that that matters as
much as they say
so that's a big hole in this we don't
quite know how important that is
and so here's another thing this doctor
says he cited the fact that the cdc
is now reporting over 4 000 deaths in
this
vares database while for the previous 20
years combined
there were only that many deaths
so if your doctor says this run away
from the doctor not from the vaccination
listen to this this is what a doctor
said in public
that you should be essentially saying
that this should matter to you
that the total deaths so far from these
coronavirus vaccinations is more than 20
years of
all the deaths ever reported from all
the other vaccines put together
if your doctor says that your doctor is
a
why go yeah yeah
let's see yeah you're seeing some people
in the comments can tell that this is a
 talking right
what's wrong with that statement
he's compared the wrong things
you don't compare this vaccination to
all the other vaccinations
that's that's the wrong comparison
you bet this is an idiot comparison
this is an idiot comparison this is
someone who doesn't know the slightest
thing
about how to compare things here's what
he should have compared it to
should have compared it to the deaths
from the coronavirus
the vaccine for the coronavirus is an
offset to the deaths from the
coronavirus
the vaccine for the coronavirus is not
trying to compensate
for something about other vaccines these
are just
different conversations for this doctor
to put in that comparison to scare you
this is doctor these are
terrible
terrible terrible way to look at
so i would say that this doctor is
statistically
incompetent there is about however a
better argument
that the therapeutics are so good now
that you basically don't need vaccines
so one of the therapeutics of boudin
budesonoid or something
it's an existing one for asthma
apparently if you
get this within the seven days of
symptoms it reduces your hospital
hospitalization rate by 90 percent
what a common over-the-counter not over
the counter but you can get a
prescription easily
a common medicine that's available in
every hospital easily
can reduce your risk of hospitalization
ninety percent
well that's uh that's pretty impressive
so we got a bunch of therapeutics that
probably do all the work
or a lot of the work that the
vaccinations would and
you also have to worry about the fact
that the people pushing the mandatory
vaccinations
are older people do you have a any kind
of a moral or ethical problem
with the fact that the people who are
talking about making your vaccinations
mandatory
are all the older people
does that bother you a little bit it
doesn't necessarily seem like you're
yeah i'm not going to talk about
ivermectin
you know i know you want to talk about
it there's just nothing else to say
about it
some people think it works some people
don't that's the whole story right now
all right um if i if i were 30 years
younger
would i get the vaccination let me
answer that question with a question
where is my online calculator to
calculate my odds
why can't i go online and just say okay
i have these situations going on
with my health what are my personal odds
of having a complication from the
vaccine
and maybe there's a range there so we
don't know the exact
exact situation but a range and then
what is my
what is my risk of long-haul risk that i
would
definitely not want or death
from uh covent itself uh you know
comparing the the vaccine versus the
the covent so i'd like an online
calculator
where i could just go in there and it
would it would include long-haul risk
and i just put in my numbers and punch
out a number
somebody says it does exist
scott has cognitive dissonance well
you're gonna have to do better than that
give me the example and tell me what the
trigger is
why do you need a calculator for your
life that's just weird
man this is where you
um this is where you can see all the the
rational people
versus the the artists i guess
the rational people would be happy to
know their odds
the artists are sure that they already
can make a decision without knowing
the odds of stuff all right
weirdly in the trump legal situation
about the
whether the taxes were paid on fringe
benefits it looks like president trump
has pretty much admitted they did all
that stuff
at least the fringe benefit part so in
his speech he's talking about how
companies don't get dinged for this
typically and he's right
but they are getting dinged for it but
here's the thing the new york
new york state attorney general who's
bringing these charges
leticia james she campaigned on promises
to investigate trump
and his business dealings she campaigned
on taking trump down
if she became the attorney general
without evidence
that's right the person who's in charge
of prosecuting the trump
company promised to do it
before having evidence of any crime
that is almost certainly racist
she's black trump is white he's assumed
to be racist
because he's white blah blah and other
things so
this looks like a racial case
and i i wonder if the supreme court
would just throw it out
because she's tipped her hand uh that
she's in she's basically in it because
she hates this guy and it looks ex
it looks overtly racist to me it looks
like a hate crime yeah
it looks like the attorney general is
perpetrating a hate crime
that's exactly what it looks like so
i don't think this is acceptable
independent of what the trump
organization did or
did not do having this particular person
in charge of the prosecution totally
unacceptable
totally unacceptable
all right
suppose a whole bunch of people don't
give vaccinations and then they die
and we can calculate how many extra
people died because they didn't get
vaccinated
first of all do you think we'll ever be
able to do that in the united states do
you think we'll come up with an estimate
that says this many extra people died
because
we didn't get the vaccination
let me tell you again i'm not going to
be talking about ivermectin
just because there's nothing to say
about it right
some people think it works some people
don't that's the end of the story
um but
wouldn't we be able to actually
calculate how many people
died from fake news
now fake news would be anything that
misled you on the statistics too
or scared you when you shouldn't have
been scared i would call that fake news
will we be able to calculate how many
people were killed by fake news and then
here's the complicated part
would it be fox news that you would
blame
maybe because they're discouraging
people from getting vaccinations
according to
brian stelter would you say
x number of people got killed by fox
news
saying there were risks with the
vaccination
or or could you say that the real
problem is that the fake news
the cnns and the scientific community
itself
have discredited themselves so much
that the people you should trust to tell
you to get a vaccination
you can't trust you legitimately can't
trust them
whose fault would it be if say a hundred
thousand people
die who didn't need to die would it be
fox news for scaring you about
vaccinations
which i think you could fairly say
happened or would it be
cnn and the scientific community and
the doctor fouches etc who had so
destroyed their own credibility
that you couldn't trust them about
anything
i feel like it's only the above yeah as
as you're saying in the comments
so does fake news kill people
yes yes in fact we've reached a point
where the biggest threat to the country
is the fake news right because the fake
news is telling you to go to war with
iraq
the fake news is telling you what to do
or not do about climate change
the fake news is telling you what to do
or not do about
nuclear energy the fake news is telling
you what to do or not do
about iran right it's all the fake news
we have one problem fake news
everything else sort of just falls down
from that
the fact that we can't trust our
institutions or our news
all right um cnn reports that 17
states have enacted uh
28 new laws that make it harder to vote
so that's cnn's take on these voting law
changes
harder to vote that's it that's the
whole story it's just making it harder
to vote
for obviously racist political reasons
well here's another report from cnn
seat belts make it harder to drive
well it's true isn't it don't seat belts
make it harder to drive
because you've got that extra time you
have to do to put on your seatbelt and
then your passenger doesn't have the
seatbelt on and the little
noise comes on and you're yeah hey put
your seat belt on
wouldn't you say that cnn should report
the seatbelts are making it harder to
drive
i'm sure it's true that these laws make
it harder to vote but that's not the
point is it
isn't the point to make the election
secure
the intention should matter the trouble
is that you can get both
you can you can make it more secure and
also
more likely to suppress a vote at the
same time
so intentions are a little mixed up here
uh yeah
uh very good analogy thank you
all right uh so apparently u.s and iran
are not making any progress toward a
nuclear deal
are you surprised um
oh somebody says fireworks are racist
because uh
black people hear noise pollution
okay i don't know about that uh so us
iran making no progress toward a nuclear
deal
big surprise are we back to
trump's approach with iran
because biden somewhat simplistically
thought that he would just get back into
this iranian nuclear deal
but that they would also improve it so
it's not good enough even for the
democrats even the democrats don't like
the nuclear deal with iran
i didn't know that before apparently
chuck schumer was adamantly opposed to
the nuclear deal
so to his credit um and so
when you thought biden was just going to
get back into the deal
even the democrats don't want to do that
so there's no deal to get back into
so in effect the biden approach to iran
is pretty much the trump approach
because when it comes right down to it
what options did they have
if you're trying to keep iran from
getting a nuclear weapon and biden says
he is
trump said he was too you got to keep
the sanctions on
and you can't make a deal so it's going
to look exactly like trump
you know give or take killing solomony
so once again the trumpification of
politics
is happening um
how many of you think that uh we're
experiencing a heat wave
that's caused by climate change
i feel like our reporting is letting us
down a little bit
i remember it wasn't too long ago when
there would be a big hurricane season
and the experts would come out and say
it's because of climate change
but then a bunch of other experts would
come out and say now
you know it could be because of climate
change but we don't see it in the
the data yet the data does not tell us
that our storms are getting worse
is that what's happening now because i
keep seeing references to climate change
is the reason
that it's so hot but is there is there a
counterpoint anymore
is there anybody saying well i see what
you're saying about all this heat
but it's not in the data yet we don't
see it yet
or or has have the critics
as well as the proponents of climate
change as being a
coming disaster have they all agreed
that this is really climate change
there's no pushback this time yeah i
don't have an opinion on it
i just don't know that there's any data
out there but we're all acting like
we know what's going on um
yeah all right so that's just an open
question
um i would say that i think we should
adopt
a new um concept and the concept goes
like this
in the old days we thought of herd
immunity
as when x number of people have been
infected or vaccinated
and if you got to that 60 or 70 percent
of your public
either already infected and having
antibodies or vaccinated
well that was enough to stop a virus
from spreading because there wouldn't be
enough people that it could jump onto
but i feel like we have to
modify that today and really we should
look at herd
immunity differently and i think herd
immunity should be when
uh everybody who has a vaccination wants
a vaccination has one
that's it that should be a herd immunity
if everybody who wants a vaccination
has one then the other people are just
taking a normal human risk and they they
get to do that
so why can't we just say we're done when
everybody who wants one can get one
and just go back to work and people will
die
yeah we can be sure of that but they
would die in the context of knowing what
the risks were
and taking a normal human risk reward
decision and deciding to go on with
their life or not
so it feels like where everything we're
doing
is to maybe sort of a little bit protect
a small percentage of the population
who uh got vaccinated but
still could die from the virus i suppose
yeah and the children yeah and what
we're doing to the children
is um the most alarming part of it
uh all right so all i'm the only thing
i'm adding to this
is the thought that the word the words
herd immunity
we should just change it for this one
situation and say once everybody wants a
vaccination has it
we're good to go that's all you can do
but we are seeing more corporations
forcing their employees to get
vaccinated
i have mixed feelings about that on one
hand
you certainly don't want forced
vaccinations
for all the obvious reasons on the other
hand or at least
if you can avoid it you don't want it on
the other hand
um what are you gonna do
some people are gonna die if you don't
do it
uh yes now we're all getting excited
about the delta variant
i don't know if the variant scares you
if if the other one uh
if the other one if the normal one
didn't scare you i don't know how the
the delta variant is going to scare you
extra
i don't imagine it
all right um
and that is all i had to talk about
today i'll uh
look into what my issues are with my
sound and then i'll get the
uh so i i already know what i need to do
every time i test this which is i add
one variable
just one variable to making the sound
work
30 failure rate it's just guaranteed
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
