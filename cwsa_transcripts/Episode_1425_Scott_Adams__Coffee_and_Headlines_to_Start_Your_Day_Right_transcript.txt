for the best part of the day it's called
the simultaneous sip
it's part of coffee with scott adams
which i think you know
is the best part of the day every single
time
every single time you say is there even
one time when it's not the best part of
the day
well maybe if you have the birth of a
child maybe if it's your wedding day
sure but otherwise it's the best part of
your day every single time and all you
need is a copper mug or a classic tanker
chelsea stein
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous up i think
you know that it's happening right now
go
ahead well youtubers who are watching
this
tell me if i've solved that problem of
an annoying click
on my audio i think i have because i've
got a
blanket down now so it's blocking my
cables from hitting the table
so it's better on periscope you say well
it's too bad periscope doesn't exist but
i'm
simultaneously streaming this now on
the locals platform in beta not
everybody can do this yet
i'm just testing the beta version
um somebody's sending me something i
need to check out later all right
so have you heard the story about the
the woman who's a guard
in a men's prison her name is gonzalez
and um she was accused of cutting a hole
in her uniform
to as they say facilitate her intimate
account
encounters with an inmate
that's right there was an attractive
young
female guard in a male prison and she'd
figured out how to cut a hole in her
uniform
to facilitate intimate encounters
with the inmate but yes she's attractive
that's important part of the story
it's actually not that important to the
story but i think it adds a little
i think you'd agree now my reaction to
this
is very much like my reaction to when i
hear that a serial killer
has built an impressive underground
layer i say to myself well that's a
horrible crime and i feel bad for the
victims
but that's one industrious serial killer
and you have to
you have to give him some props for
working hard at his craft
and putting passion into it now this
prison
uh prison guard again i have to say
well it's a crime and we cannot condone
such activity
we must compliment her for her
creativity
now wouldn't you like to see a little
bit more detail on this story
because i would i'd like to know
what is the nature of the hole she put
in her uniform
to quote facilitate her intimate
encounters
because i'm no fashion expert
but if you had a prison guard uniform
and let's say there was a hole
let's say about this size we don't know
but
you know let's say it's a hole about the
size and let's say this hole was in her
let's say lower region of her body
is that the sort of thing nobody would
notice i'd like you to do a test
test at home take your favorite pants
and cut a hole through the pant part
and also any undergarments so you've got
a
full uh full access there for your uh
facilitating your intimate encounters
with your spouse and try wearing
wearing your pants with the hole cut out
in the
lower region try wearing that all day
and see if anybody notices because the
first question i have is
was there some kind of a velcro
fastener over the hole so that she could
just sort of quickly
open it up or was it just always open
because you got the advantage of the
airflow is better
but also quick access for your intimate
encounters
i just have lots of questions the other
question i have is
how much game did this inmate have
you know i tend to put myself in every
story because you know we're all
narcissists at some some level so i
always imagine myself in the story
in order to you know consume it
and i put myself in the story and i say
to myself
if i were not famous and rich
do i think i could attract a hot female
guard
in a jail full of men
would i be the one who got her to cut a
hole in her uniform
for facilitating my intimate encounters
because i feel i couldn't pull that off
i mean i have a pretty good opinion of
myself
but i look at all this
and i say to myself if i were literally
in jail
for a horrible crime and i'm behind bars
could i with all of this
talk a attractive female guard into
cutting a hole in her uniform
to facilitate my intimate encounters and
as much as i have a pretty high opinion
of my persuasive abilities
i don't think i could pull that off
could you
do you think any of you could pull that
off the important part of the story is
show us a picture of the inmate who the
hell
is this inmate who got this to happen
because i'm thinking this is some
impressive work by the inmate
all right all right
matt tybee has an interesting article
over on
sub stack and by the way you should
follow matt
uh tayyip b in all things because he's
an insanely good writer he's talking
about the uh
dark horse podcast you've heard the
story brett weinstein
has had some guests who have said some
things that are counter to the official
story on
coronavirus medical treatment
one of the stories about ivermectin
which is not
an improved treatment but there are some
doctors who think maybe should be
and i think at least one episode about
some risks of vaccines which again goes
counter to the
official policy shall we say
and so he's been demonetized
and so this story the story continues
about him being demonetized for this
and uh as matt tybee points out there's
an interesting
wrinkle here because s specifically
um about weinstein's demonetization
so youtube was asked if they get their
guidance
for who to demonetize just specifically
in the in the medical information part
where do they get their guidance so how
does youtube decide
whether to demonetize somebody and
apparently the answer is uh
they they do talk to authorities
government authorities
and they say they consult other
authorities
and added that when we develop our
policies we consult
outside experts and youtube creators
in the case of cover 19 misinformation
policies it would be guidance from local
and global health authorities so this is
what youtube says
so youtube says they get their guidance
from local and global health authorities
now those authorities would be
government would they not
the the authorities would be the cdc
etc and
certainly we don't want to be uh we
don't want to be censored in the united
states because there's
some other government who would like us
to be censored
wouldn't you agree that if the only
people who wanted
uh are our creators to be demonetized on
a particular topic
if the only ones who wanted that were
outside of the united states
but nobody in the united states cared we
probably wouldn't pay attention to it
right
if if the speech were okay in the united
states
youtube would probably allow it i
imagine so it's not really the
other worldly governments that matter
but rather it's our own local and
local authorities one assumes they're
the ones that matter in this case
so here's the the gray area
so if the government tried to censor a
citizen
is that okay of course not right the
constitution
says that the that the government should
not be censoring the citizens
now what if a private individual
tries to censor you is that okay and the
answer is
uh yeah yes it is
so so a private person can sense you but
the government can't
but what happens if the private company
in this case youtube
what happens if they consult with the
government
and they've agreed to take the
government's advice
now it gets a little dicey doesn't it so
if the government
is the one who advises youtube and then
youtube
simply follows their guidance and here's
the key
every time every time
if youtube follows the medical guidance
of the united states government entities
let's say the cdc in this case
and they do it every time they never
vary from that and why would they really
how could they i could you imagine that
youtube would say well the cdc said this
but we've decided we're going to go a
different direction
no i think it's safe to assume that if
youtube has this policy
at all which is to listen to the
government on these medical questions
that they're going to use their advice
they're not going to ignore it
so what do you call it when the
government's
let's say the government's viewpoint
can effectively be the thing that shuts
down a citizen
does it matter that youtube technically
has a choice
of whether they follow that follow that
guidance or not
or do they have a choice what would
happen to youtube
if they started promoting wildly bad
medical advice don't you think the
government would shut them down
i mean they would they would do
something to them maybe not shut them
down
but if youtube can't disobey the
government
it's the government that's censoring
brett weinstein isn't it
would you buy that argument that if
youtube
technically they have the right
to you know ignore the government i
guess do they
i suppose they do right freedom of
speech so they could do it
but in the real world they can't i mean
not
really they can so what happens
so what do you do i'll tell you where i
come down on this if i were the supreme
court
i would say this is government
censorship
because the government's hand on this is
so heavy that it's
effectively government censorship but
here's the other part that's hard
the government isn't always wrong all
right
the government isn't always wrong so it
could be
that in this this very specific case of
a pandemic
that the government is just trying to
save lives and maybe
it would maybe a reasonable person would
look at this and say
yeah we get all the arguments about free
speech nobody
nobody disagrees that you got to
maintain free speech and that this is
definitely infringing it
but what if it also saved millions of
lives
what do you do when free speech might
kill
millions of people in an honest opinion
because let's say you thought that free
speech
would cause people to get fewer
vaccinations and you legitimately
believe that would cost
lives what do you do do you say freedom
of speech is so important we're going to
let a million people die
would you make that decision let's see
in the comments
now i know you don't think a million
people will die so i understand that
the hypothetical is stretched too far
but i want to see in your comments how
many of you would let a million people
die
to protect freedom of speech on one
topic
so it's one temporary topic
because even speech about the pandemic
will be fine after the
pandemic's over so it's temporary it's
on one topic and it's for the benefit
of the country save a million people and
i'm looking at your comments and most of
you would let a million people die for
freedom of speech
i choose death people say you know i'm
i'm not going to criticize that opinion
um i don't know where i would come down
on this
because it's hypothetical so i don't
have to decide but
i could respect your opinion on that i
could respect that you would lose a
million people to
maintain freedom of speech as an
absolute i could see that
i'm not sure i would come down in the
same place but i could see it
i think where i would decide is whether
it was creating a permanent situation
so if we thought that making an
exception in this one specific case
was likely to cause you know more
exceptions then that'd be a problem
so i think that's where i'd come down on
it slippery slope right if you think
it's a slippery so you have to treat it
that way
now there's an interesting sub story
here on this
uh on this situation
um so claire lehman i hope i'm
pronouncing that right
founder of coilette and well known on
twitter
has a big twitter account um she and
brett weinstein are having a little uh
twitter battle back and forth and
um she points out that in her one of her
exchanges with brett
on twitter she says claire says don't
patronize me your rhetoric
is fueling vaccine hesitancy and you
know it
you need to fix what you are creating
and i'm not so sure
does he because let's say that the claim
is correct
let's say that uh brett's content
which claire calls it rhetoric all right
so writer
right away she's using a a loaded word i
would say that he's creating content
that is not in the mainstream if you
want to take all the emotion out of it
right
but if you want to put some opinion into
your statement you say it's rhetoric
his rhetoric because that just makes it
look like it's right
so your rhetoric is fueling vaccine
hesitancy
let's say that's true don't call it
rhetoric let's say content
let's say brett's content is
fueling vaccine hesitancy
is that a reason not to do it is that a
good enough reason not to do it
because i don't know that it is
i think i'm hearing uh christina
practice in the piano if you hear that
so anyway we're i'm just watching this
because i think it's kind of fascinating
the the free speech element to this all
right here's another uh
unexpected uh you know unintended
consequences of something
so as you know bill cosby was freed
because there had been a
allegedly a prior agreement must have
been an oral agreement
with a prosecutor that he wouldn't be
prosecuted for the specific crime he was
and so he got out of jail and now not
only did uh
harvey weinstein's lawyer say hey we're
next
i kind of doubt harvey weinstein is next
but
jillaine gillane or gizlane maxwell
whose name we cannot pronounce but
before i go on
let me thank the simulation and the
authors of the simulation
for making guillains maxwell maxwell's
name
have something that looks like jizz
jizzlane
and max in the name because if you were
going to name a
let's say a fictional character
who did all of the things that jizz lane
maxwell is accused of doing i would want
her name to have jizz in it and max
maximum jizz i feel like the simulation
is just giving this to us
so let's take it anyway her appellate
lawyer
is arguing that she too was subject to
an agreement not to prosecute and
apparently
there was and i think correct me if i'm
wrong i think even alan dershowitz
either negotiated this or was even
covered by it or both
there was some kind of agreement that
when uh epstein was prosecuted
whatever that deal was back in 2010 or
something
that there was some deal not to
prosecute co-conspirators
someone tells scott about wayne sexton
don't know about wayne sexton
so anyway but the point is
we don't know the details of this claim
but
i think she might actually have a claim
she might actually be have a get out of
jail card here
because if it's true that she was
covered under this agreement
she walks right so it's entirely
possible that
geez lane will get out of jail just like
cosby
so i don't know how likely that is but i
would say this is
it's not impossible which is scary as
hell
well here's a case of the slippery slope
taking care of itself or
a self-correcting problem
did you see that a transgender woman
has earned the title of miss nevada so
in the i guess it's the miss usa contest
and a filipino american cataluna
enriquez
was crowned the winner for nevada so we
have a transgender woman who's
miss nevada now and she bested 21
21 other candidates
to win so
there are two ways to look at this
one way to look at this and probably
many of you are looking at it this way
yeah miss america and miss usa are two
different competitions that i think
that's correct somebody's
telling me here so here's the thing
on one hand you could say to yourself
that the drama with
with transgender athletes is
ruining sports some people say that
right or
ruining women's sports that's what the
critics would say
and now i imagine that there will be
critics who say that the transgender
winning
miss nevada is ruining the miss usa
pageant would you say that
they had a perfectly good pageant and
now it's getting ruined
ruined i say by this transgender
competitor i've got a different opinion
i feel that what happened was that the
transgender athletes have shown us
what's wrong with sports
and what's wrong with pageants i don't
think the transgenders
are what's broken here i think the
transgender athletes and the transgender
miss usa contestants are
just people but they're in a system that
had some flaws one of the flaws is
why the hell is there a miss usa contest
in 2021
isn't everything about that just feels
wrong in
2021 really we're going to make a bunch
of women
uh walk around in bathing suits and
judge them and
and their minor talents and it's all
about how you look
there's nothing wrong with this
transgender uh
competitor the competitor is fine
it's the competition that's just
ridiculous so if the person who's fine
breaks a competition don't necessarily
blame the competitor
maybe the competition didn't make any
sense in 2021
likewise i think sports should be among
people who are similarly skilled
regardless of gender so in my opinion
it's the sports that are broken
not the athlete because everybody should
have access to sports one way or the
other
so i'm not going to make a bigger
argument there except to say there are
two ways to look at it
one is that the transgenders are ruining
everything
and the other is people are people some
are transgender
how about if you can't uh if you can't
create a system that handles people
maybe maybe the system needs some
adjustment
so i'll just put that out there because
i know it catches your hair on fire you
hate it
but i had a philosophy teacher who once
told me
this this analogy that has stuck with me
forever it was just one of these
one little moment in time i'll never
forget
and the philosophy teacher said if you
ever had a
loose tooth especially when you're a kid
you've got a tooth that's loose what do
you do with it
you keep pushing around with your tongue
right and when you push it with your
tongue it kind of hurts
but you can't stop doing it it hurts
it doesn't really do anything useful but
you can't you can't stop
you just keep hurting yourself with it
and uh i had some point about that but
i don't know what the point was but i
guess that won't change your life the
way it did mine
all right uh yes there are some pains
that we
we run toward um so let's talk about the
uh
the olympic athlete shah khari
richardson you know
i kind of love the name shaw
hyphen kerry or kari i don't know
exactly how to pronounce it
but would you have a boring name like
scott or mike
or you know bob
you go through life with just your
boring name but then here's
shaw curry who has to stop and spell her
name for everybody it's like no there's
a hyphen
no you're not done you're not done with
the hyphen the hyphen's in the middle
and then you just keep going it's like
two names but with a hyphen no
but it's real it's one name so it's very
inconvenient
but very uh exotic i like it
so she got accused of having some
marijuana in her system
and she's a sprinter and she'll maybe
banned from competing
in the olympics which is tragic now
here's the first thing i'd like to say
about this
she needs a nickname i don't think she
should be
called shaw kyrie richardson although
it's an awesome name as i said
i'd like to give her a nickname i'd call
her the weed runner
yeah the weed runner so the weed runner
is being supported by aoc who says the
criminalization and banning of cannabis
is an instrument of
racist and colonial policy the ioc
should reconsider its suspension of miss
ms richardson and any athletes penalize
for cannabis use this ruling
oh and then she throws in this there's
something about
the ioc denied some kind of swimming
caps
for natural hair meaning a
curlier kind of hair meaning essentially
the kind of hair
that black people typically have which
um
i'm assuming that the topic here is that
if your hair has a certain quality
it's harder to wear a standard bathing
cap
so the ones that are more conveniently
made
if you have a certain kind of hair
especially if you're black i assume
that's what this is about
they got banned now what do i tell you
about aoc
i tell you that she has more game yeah
exactly somebody's saying in the
comments
she has more game than other people
and this was something that republicans
should have done
first republicans always being accused
of being the racist right
oh you're republican you're a racist
this was free money sitting on the table
the country is solidly against this
you no matter what anybody thinks about
marijuana the country
does not want this competitor who you
know who struggled and
is trying to represent our country and
you worked hard and everything
had this one little mistake the country
wants her to compete
the country wants to back her
where are the politicians where the hell
are the republicans
the republicans should have seen this
let's say ron desantis where's ron
desantis it's sort of a national issue
so maybe maybe he's not weighing in on
it
but the republicans should have been
all the over this because it's an
easy one
it's so easy somebody says matt gates
spoke up there you go
so matt gates is consistently smart
enough to talk about the things that
that are free money it's just laying on
the table just pick it up
just picking up that free money just
take it
and be a little less racist looking but
no
they the republicans fail totally
and honestly if you don't try a little
bit
to look non-racist even the people who
think you're not racist
are gonna wonder what's going on all
right
right i mean i back a lot of
republican-y things even though i don't
identify as republican but if something
makes sense
such as having strong border security
i've never seen that as a political
question
that's just what works what doesn't work
et cetera
so i mean
i would love to be more supportive of
republicans
but when you let something this easy
slip away
i mean this was just a layup all
you had to do
all you had to do is say this looks a
little extreme
the ioc should look into this that's it
not a big deal just a little bit of
support for an american athlete
who happens to be black right it's just
easy money but aoc just comes in and she
just
hammers this thing she hammers it like
she owns it
free money she got it republicans left
it on the table
and and when they do that you got to ask
yourself why
are they so dumb they couldn't see the
play
or did they actually not want to be
anti-racist
even i have a question about that and
i'm not the i'm not the person who's
you know accusing republicans of being
racist every day but even i have to look
at this
and say this was so easy so
easy and you couldn't do even this
crazy all right
uh jesse waters has an interesting
attack on
kamala harris so i guess jesse has a new
book
whose name i don't remember right now
but
just look for the new jesse waters book
if you'd like to read that
he was on turkey carlson he was talking
about how
kamala harris has a quote cackle
and i thought to myself that's a pretty
good
kill shot if you wanted to guarantee
that
kamala harris was never president this
talk about her cackle
might get you there you know i i called
this out really early on and saying
that she would probably get professional
help to get rid of the cackle this was
even
before before the election now i don't
know if she got professional help
but she did not get rid of the cackle so
it didn't work if she got any
and it's a real problem because it just
makes you look like a loser frankly
it just makes you look like a total
loser when you go until
mode you just don't look like a leader
and i just
can't imagine that she could get elected
with that cackle
so um if fox news and or that
side of the world has identified the
cackle
as a an attack of a vector it's a good
one
it's totally good the more they talk
about the cackle
the more that's all you'll be able to
see and all you'll be able to think
about all you'll be able to imagine
so it's really strong it shouldn't be
important at all
if you were to rank it about how
actually important it is
it's not actually important at all but
boy does it feel like it
it just it's just really strong as a as
a
just an emotional response because a lot
of us have a real
visceral reaction to it don't you
um don't you don't you have like a
visceral reaction to it's like ugh
what is that and i don't get that from
politicians that i don't even agree
with right take take your most
disliked politician on whatever is the
other side from you
do you have a do you have that kind of
feeling for them or you just
don't like their politics it's very rare
that you'd have like a visceral
reaction to anybody all right
so that's pretty productive attack there
now speaking of
kamala harris so one of the big stories
is that there's
axios is reported from anonymous sources
that her office is dysfunctional and her
chief of staff is mean and things are a
mess
inside now how would i treat this story
if this story were about the trump
administration
right so i'm going to demonstrate
something called fairness
if you've never seen it you don't see
much of it
i'm going to treat this story exactly
the way i would have
if this had been a trump story it's
it's now am i saying that this
that the office is not dysfunctional no
i'm saying every office is dysfunctional
i'm the dilbert guy
i created the dilbert comic strip every
office
is dysfunctional it's only whether
people are talking about it or not
now now you know maybe not every
unimportant department of
every company but any sizable
department any anybody any department
that's big enough to
have lots of people in it doing
important things the pressure is high
they're all dysfunctional you get an
anonymous person to say that
your company is dysfunctional
of course you could there's always an
anonymous
disgruntled person and it's usually a
person who made suggestions
that sucked right every office has that
person who says
you should do x because i'm the smartest
person in the office
and therefore you should do x and then
everybody says no x is a dumb idea
that's that's like totally stupid
we've tried x x doesn't work we've got
data x will never work
you're a complete loser get away from us
with this we must do x
what does that person do does that
person say oh
well now that you've explained it to me
i'm actually really dumb
and my idea was worthless i apologize
for wasting your time
no no that person who thought their
suggestion was brilliant
will go to anybody who will listen
including the press
and say these people don't even listen
to a good idea
because i had a brilliant idea brilliant
idea
and it just got shot down because it's
dysfunctional there
they don't even know a good idea when
they see it because i keep coming up
with these great ideas and people keep
shooting me down all right this is
exactly what i would tell you
if this anonymous sore story had come
out about trump
it's just a way to it was just a
criticism
that works so i would give it zero
credibility even if it's true
meaning that everything's a little bit
dysfunctional so calling out this one
office probably is
overkill all right um and it's probably
a whisper campaign
because the other thing that we're
hearing i think axios reported this
was that democrat strategists believe
that a a presidential candidate harris
couldn't beat any republican
that's a pretty strong statement that if
it's true
right it's not sourced etc so so don't
put too much
belief in it but i think it might be
true
it rings true to me if you said to me
name a republican
who might get nominated so they'd have
to be at least strong enough to get
nominated
name any republican who couldn't beat
kamala harris and her cackle and the
answer is i can't think of one
i actually can't think of any republican
who couldn't be
goblin harris at this point
right somebody says mitt romney okay
maybe
but but i'm saying they'd have to be
able to get nominated
so anybody who could get nominated is
automatically you know going to be a
strong candidate
yeah i don't think there's anybody who
couldn't beat her at this point
so it could be that the democrats are
looking to take her out
right because if democrats want to
maintain power
she's not the source of that in the
future so they might need to take her
out and make room for
somebody else to you know be the biden
successor all right
let's talk about these trump indictments
so
cnn of course and all the anti-trump
news
needs to make these look as big as
possible
and i don't think they wanted an
immediate
any kind of immediate result because the
longer they can drag this out
the longer it's a topic that makes um
trump
have a have a problem running for office
if he does again
and so they're saying that
this morning cnn's reporting the
commission of other crimes
in addition to the scheme to defraud in
the first degree
i would call that an alleged an alleged
scheme because it's not a scheme
until it's sort of proven in court right
at this point it's an allegation i
wouldn't call it a scheme
at this point so i guess there's a
grand larceny in the second degree i
don't even know what that's about
some kind of grand larceny charge and
that's the second most serious
white-collar crime in
the state and various charges of
falsifying records
falsifying record seems like a bigger
deal doesn't it
the other stuff looks like it could be
just some kind of a
tax related fine i don't know if anybody
goes to jail for that but
falsifying records looks like something
you could go to jail for
um now i think the way you should see
the story is
is it big enough to keep trump out of
office
for a second term and i'm thinking it
might be
yeah this this story is big enough that
it will slime the trump family
sufficiently that it's not really going
to matter who's innocent and who's
guilty
and what the details are it just feels
like russia and collusion doesn't it
it's just sort of the new russia
collusion if you can just say it
say it enough times and treat it like
it's a headline every day
it's all you need to keep trump out of
office probably
so here's a story that is
not too terribly important to most of us
but
a sign of the times so there's a super
yacht
being built a yacht so big that it will
have
39 apartments that you could buy
and these apartments would be so
impressive
that even though it's on a boat each one
of the 39 apartments might have its own
gym
and might have a library it might have
inside and outside dining spaces etc
and the boat is the sumneo and it's
going to be built
and launched in 2024 i guess but
here's why this is important most of you
cannot spend
uh i think it's 11 million dollars for
an apartment on this boat
so most of us will not be buying any
space on the boat
including me but i've said for a long
time that the future might be floating
cities
and there would have to be cities that
could move because there might be a
weather event you know might be
hurricane season or something they just
need to
sort of float away to a safer place
and i've got a feeling that this
although it's you know just for rich
people
i feel like it's going to be a model for
the future
i feel as though uh yeah i feel as
though water world is coming
because it's it's basically free land
right
if you can put your your seafaring uh
whatever platform in the ocean
you don't have any laws right you can
just live there
and i think that our technology for
creating energy is better than storing
it so you probably can't get enough from
the sun and storing it in batteries
we're close to the point where you can
do all that desalinization
important waste processing i don't know
where we are on that whether you could
you could do that well enough if to stay
at sea i imagine you could
but i don't know um
an artificial island was taken down
recently yeah so there have been a lot
of you know
seasteading kinds of uh
kinds of plans but i feel as if it's
just the economics
and maybe a little bit of technology
that needs to advance just a little bit
before it becomes a major thing it seems
to me that living on the ocean is just
pretty much guaranteed at this point
we're going to see it
all right what time is it it looks like
um yeah so
uh what i did i'm gonna be talking to
the
people on locals after i get off of
youtube i've got a
i've got a story that i can't tell in
public
um but i'm going to tell to the locals
people
if you're wondering to yourself why do
people pay a subscription to hear my
extra content part of it is that i do
share with them things that i won't say
in regular public believe it or not
nothing i've ever said privately on the
locals community
has gotten into the general public yet
now i don't think that can last but i'm
very impressed
so i'm not going to say anything that
would you know get me canceled or
or anything but there are there are
definitely topics
that just don't work in the general
public but they work fine
within locals so i'll be sharing with
them a little story
when i get off here and i will talk to
you on youtube
yeah nsa has it i'll be talking to you
on youtube
tomorrow
