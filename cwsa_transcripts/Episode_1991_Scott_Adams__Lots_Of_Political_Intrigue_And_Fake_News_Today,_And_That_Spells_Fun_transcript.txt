good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the
finest thing that's ever happened and
today we have
Intrigue and fake news and all kinds of
good stories it's going to be a good one
and if you'd like to enjoy this with the
maximum amount of
oxytocin and
oh all those good chemicals all you need
is a copper mug or a glass of tank or
Chelsea style and a canteen Jugger flask
a festival of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
that was good dopamine I Feel the Rush
good stuff
well there was a feel-good story in
Houston
um do you mind if I start with the
feel-good stories
would you like like like a nice warm
fuzzy feeling you know get the week
going
after the holiday warm fuzzy so and
there was a local Taqueria in Houston
where a 30 year old gentleman robbed all
the patrons so he took out a gun and
pointed all the patrons and made them
hand over their wallets and stuff
did I mention this was Houston
yeah there was somebody who decided that
brandishing a gun in a public area in
Houston
would would turn out okay
um so there was a patron who was armed
did I mention it was Houston
[Laughter]
there was a patron who was armed who
shot the Intruder which apparently is
legal it's totally legal because the guy
was brandishing a gun I like saying
brandishing he was brandishing all over
oh man he was brandishing he was
brandishing like crazy and so the guy
shot him but the other part of the story
is that he shot him like nine times
including when he was down and that he
dumped his he dumped his beverage on him
before he left and then he just laughed
foreign
there's some suggestion that he actually
was guilty of a crime
because the thinking is that once he had
neutralized the attacker there was no
reason to do any additional shooting
I would like to present his defense for
him if I may
hear now the defense
for the person who shot nine times and
dumped his beverage on him number one
I'm not a doctor
I don't know if somebody can get up from
a particular kind of injury do you
so put me on the put me on the witness
stand all right after you shot him once
and he went down
and the and the danger was neutralized
why did you keep shooting to which I say
well I'm not I'm not a doctor I don't
know what kind of
uh injury somebody can take and not be
able to fight back you say yes but you
know they took the gut away from I don't
know if that's true but let's say the
gun
you know maybe fell or something then
I'd say well I don't know if he has
another one
do you know if he has another gun
I didn't know how would I know that why
would I take that chance
he's obviously a guy that points guns at
people and I just shot him if he had
another gun I'm dead
so why would I take that chance
so you're saying that my it my risk was
over when he went down and I say that's
for me to decide
that's for me to decide you don't get to
you don't get to decide my risk
if there's a guy who shoots people and
uses guns and robs people just because I
saw one of his guns was no longer in
action I don't know what else he could
do and I don't know how many times have
you heard a story about the the guy who
got shot six times and still attacks
somebody
lots of times because you know they're
on I don't know some kind of weird drug
or something but that's the thing I
would say if you tell me I'm supposed to
be an expert on Military injuries
how is that reasonable
no I have one job which is to keep
myself safe and the other patrons and I
made sure I got it done
what's wrong with making sure you're
safe
what what is the percentage of safety
that you believe is appropriate to me
how much safety should is my safety
based on your assessment of my safety or
is my assessment of my safety the one
that matters in this situation pretty
sure it's mine pretty sure it's mine
so here we do the argument nobody can
tell you what your risk is when you're
in the moment
here's the other thing I would say if
it's true it might be true I didn't even
know I shot nine times
I literally didn't even know it
because in the moment
I'm not some kind of trained policeman
I'm not in the military
I saw a threat I pulled my gun and
honestly I don't even know what happened
in the next 10 seconds because it was
just fog of War my brain was on fire
I was just like my brain was on fire I
barely remember what happened
did I fire nine times the only reason I
know is because when I pulled the
trigger the tenth time there was no no
bullets or something like that
so
I don't see how he could possibly be
convicted do you if he had a good
attorney
if he has a bad attorney I suppose
anything's possible or a bad jury yeah
the last shot was in the head
yep doesn't change the thing
I would say if you can't be sure you
can't be sure and it wasn't his problem
to solve
well uh a reparations panel in San
Francisco
was tasked with coming up with a
suggestion of what reparation should be
I think there was an earlier report they
came up with some number like 200 000
per black person or something
in California and but this group came up
with a different number
um
5 million per black person
that's a recommendation five million per
black person now the total budget of the
city of San Francisco is 14 billion a
year
uh and the recommendation is to spend 50
billion on reparations so each each San
Francisco black person
who has been black for at least 10 years
yeah you have to you have to be black
for at least 10 years
people have only been black for like say
three to five years nothing
so I've only been black for
I don't know
maybe eight years so I get nothing I get
nothing I've only been black for like
eight years
so
but this is why you know I've been
teaching you this is why you started
early
because they put that 10-year thing I'm
only about two years away from
qualifying
five million dollars free money right so
I've been planning way ahead so two
years from now if this comes up I'm
gonna say I got my 10 years in but I
guess you have to prove it with
government documents that'd be a little
harder
the committee also proposed wiping out
all debts associated with educational
personal uh credit cards payday loans
for black households
yeah so the 50-member panel was
established by the San Francisco
supervisors
so
let me give you a suggestion
for how to make bad ideas go away
you tell them to form a committee
and get real specific about what it is
they're asking
because then it's easy to ignore it
because it'll be so ridiculous
see this is the same thing that Gavin
Newsom did apparently there was at least
two panels so I think Gavin Newson had a
panel and they came back with that
quarter million dollars you know that
was Impractical too
I think that was always the play
and Newsome played a completely right
he took it seriously in the sense that
he formed a committee to make a
recommendation and then gave them
attention
that seems perfectly fair and then once
they got attention and they showed you
what their idea was it was completely
impractical
problem solved
[Laughter]
so I don't think you know the the thing
you want to watch out for is that
Newsome is it he's a strong player like
if you don't like his politics like blah
blah blah but don't overlook the fact
that he has Gabe all right he he could
be coming
all right uh let's see that was fun
uh more reports that China has more
deaths than birth this year
so there was something like in very
rough numbers 10 million deaths and 9
million some bursts
so president XI actually wants to boost
the population of China
how many of you had that on your
predictions
how many of you were predicting you know
I think China is going to really want to
increase their their population
like that that would have been hard to
predict wouldn't it
um but yeah I think Peter zann is saying
that they probably have been decreasing
the population for 14 years or so
they're probably just been lying about
their data
and uh all the experts say that it's a
demographic time bomb and there won't be
enough young people to support all the
old people
fairly soon it's a problem
so it's going to take a while to
convince everybody that population
growth isn't the problem
that Prosperity actually solves that so
you just do Prosperity right and your
biggest problem is not enough people
the United States uh do me a fact check
of this I thought I saw this but I don't
have the source right here I thought I
saw that last year the United States
population
would have decreased if not for
immigration including illegal
is that true
was the population of the United States
not going to grow or would it slightly
decrease except for immigration
give me a fact check on that
right that I think it's true
but
um here's what I think I should do
before 2024.
I'm thinking of creating a series of
maybe like you know one minute videos in
which I explained a policy position that
would work for everybody
because a lot of these things have
policy positions that nobody has staked
down
the both the Democrat and a republican
would totally agree with I think
right and here here's how I would do it
if I let's say I'm Trump and I want to I
want to avoid all the you know the
Border racism questions right if I'm
Trump
I say oh let's do this let's form a
economic board
who decides who to let in under what
circumstances that benefits the economy
of the United States the most and make
sure that board is super diverse
who says no to that
uh we really if he creates a super
diverse Board of actual economists and
the economists say you know I think we
should let in know people this year
then don't
or if they say we should let in 5
million because otherwise you know we'll
have a shrinking population and even
though it's a burden on our systems
we're still better off you know
hypothetically I'm not saying they would
say that but but whatever they say
because I think I think that the
decision should be offloaded to
economists and they should be a diverse
group of economists so you don't worry
about the racial stuff and and they
should just say we think the country is
better off with this level and then just
manage to that level
who says who says no to that
right who says no
now somebody would find some reason to
complain about something but it's way
better than what other what the
Democrats are doing which is nothing
and what what Trump will suggest which
will sound too harsh right
why why do we want to choose between
basically nothing open borders you know
I know it's not technically open borders
but you know what I
versus somebody who's going to get
everybody mad that it sounds racist
why is why are those our choices
right anybody could just choose the
smarter one instead of having the
Congress decide how many people come in
which is dumb
do what we do when we do budgets you
have the the was the OMB
sort of somewhat objectively scores your
budgets and says is this good or bad
just do that
how many people how many people argue
with the OMB lately
I mean it happens but I feel like that's
become a credible
least credible feelings system
led by now I don't Gates
no I don't know what his views are on
immigration exactly
all right well that's my suggestion
um I see more talk about the Biden
residents not having guest logs and so
Tom fitton say that if the if the Secret
Service is doing its job there has to be
visitor logs
to which I asked the question
is that true
is it true that the Secret Service as a
log of everybody who comes in because
didn't we learn that the White House did
not keep a guest log during the Trump
Administration they had one and then
they got rid of it
how could it be true that they got rid
of the White House log
will all would also be true that the
Secret Service would keep a log of
everybody who visited which sounds
reasonable
seems reasonable and
then somebody suggested that they need
background checks of everybody who
visits the president do you think so
do you think they really do background
checks of everybody who visits the
president
you do
I'm not entirely sure you might be right
I mean it's a bureaucracy so maybe they
just do it it could be it's just the
rule and they just do all the time but
so when I visited the White House
um I gave them you know my name and
information probably gave them my social
security number probably probably I
think I gave them my driver's license at
some point either before or when I
checked in I can't remember maybe both
so they could certainly do a uh
a quick uh digital check right they
could check government government
records
but nobody nobody talked to me
and nobody nobody talked to relatives or
nobody talked to my Close Associates or
anything like that so how much of a
check do they really do
and then here's the question
if they see a name on the list that it's
a public figure
do they really Jack
really like if when Kim Kardashian
was invited to the White House did they
do a background check on her
the most transparent person on the
planet Earth
but probably it was perfunctory don't
you think
same with me don't you think it was just
perfunctory I've never said that that
word out loud
I waited my whole life to say
perfunctory
I think I know what it means you know
just sort of going through the motions
yeah I don't think that anybody even
like looked at it I think they just
probably type my name into the system
something spit out and they said go
ahead
all right so
I I guess we have some interesting
questions about whether they have a list
and how much they actually check my
suspicion is unless you're a complete
unknown like a like a citizen who did
something famous
I'm sure they check all the normal
citizens
that makes sense
I don't think they check as much if
you're a public figure because I think
you just you know I mean there's not any
Real Surprises with public figures
so McCarthy kept his promise
um
to try to pass a bill to cancel the
funding of the 87 000 new IRS employees
that were trying to be hired
and it looks like that's popular 64
percent of publicans are in favor of
canceling it but even 52 percent of
Democrats and Affiliated non-affiliated
voters so a solid majority of every type
of voter
uh well 52 is not that solid but a
majority
um don't want it and McCarthy is falling
through
now I yeah I guess it still goes to the
Senate so who knows if that's going to
happen
all right who would like to hear an
inspirational story
anybody
it's even better than the Houston
shooting
all right now the people on uh the
locals platform heard this but I'm going
to add a detail that you didn't hear
and it's a fun detail it's worth it so
don't tune out because you've already
heard it
so yesterday I was planning to go to
Starbucks do some work with my car's in
the shop because I have a BMW so
it always has some kind of warning light
on or another so it's in the shop and of
course it always goes in the shop on a
three-day weekend of course
of course I don't bring it in on a
Friday but you know it got extended into
the three-day weekend
so I called an Uber Uber shows up and
it's uh
it's a Tesla
and uh I realized that I'd never opened
a Tesla car door
and uh it's got the the door handles
like flat with the door itself
and so I'm standing outside the Uber and
I'm like a I'm like a monkey with a
coconut trying to open this car up like
and you know that the driver sees that
I'm struggling and I'm
Boomer yes you can say Boomer totally
appropriate under these circumstances
now to be clear
I've been in a few Teslas I've ridden in
them before but I can't remember ever
opening the door I think maybe the door
was opened or something I don't know
but I've never opened one so anyway I I
finally figured out how to push it and
it comes out and I open the door so I'm
getting in the in the door and the the
driver jokes with me and he jokes this
way he goes you know Elon Musk he
doesn't make these cars he doesn't
design these cars for the Common People
Like Us
he goes I think he just makes these cars
for like you know Geniuses or something
so everybody has trouble with the car
door we can't figure it out
so we're laughing about you know Elon
Musk designing this car that I can't
figure out how to get into
so it's a young hispanic driver told me
he was 26 years old and I asked him
where he lived he said Stockton but he
likes to he likes to drive now Stockton
if you don't know California is a
higher crime lower income place it's
sort of not the not an ideal place to be
an Uber driver you'd want to go to a
better neighborhood but one of the
reasons he goes to my neighborhood is
that we're just it's a rich neighborhood
so we're just full of CEOs and Tech Bros
and you know just successful people of
all kinds and so he drives in that
neighborhood and he explicitly has this
strategy
he's been reading motivational books and
stuff and he had a tough childhood I
guess his mom was a drug drug addict and
um high crime and you know just the
worst situation poverty and he was he
was going to be the one who made it out
right so he figured out how to become an
Uber driver and and his strategy was his
system
his system was to drive where he would
be
exposed to successful people
and his theory was that that exposure
would have a variety of benefits which
would help him in his his you know
is raced to the top
so we're chatting away now
just hold this into your mind
here's somebody whose strategy
was to try to meet the right people who
could help him and of all the people in
the whole world
eight billion people in the world
there wasn't anybody better for him to
be in that car than me now I know I know
what you're going to say oh my God the
ego on this man no I'm just saying that
it's exactly my job
my precise exact job
is giving career and success advice to
exactly people like him
you know my book had to fail it's
probably the most influential book in
that genre at the moment
eight million people on earth
and I got in his car
right now everybody who's saying
braggart and ego I do this intentionally
to find out who are the weak people to
get rid of
because you can't even handle the
conversation
right but
there's no way to tell the story without
saying it's the truth is there's
probably nobody better on the planet
than me at this very narrow thing right
there's lots of things I'm bad at that
you're better than I am I'm not saying
I'm better than you I'm saying this very
narrow thing is what I do
like it was like somebody else uh I'm
not going to make that comparison
that'll get me in trouble
so
I tell this story on Twitter I tell this
story about the young man whose system
was to meet people and that he was lucky
enough to meet me and I I left off
cryptically and I uh this is true as I
was leaving the car uh at Starbucks I
said you don't know it yet but this is
the luckiest day of your life
Now by then I'd already told them what
my book was and who I was and you know
we talked a little bit about
the whole genre of self-help et cetera
so you do where I fit into the the
ecosystem
but the story is not over
I tweet about this and I tell the story
about how you know this young man came
from Bad circumstances and was using his
system to meet people and it worked that
he met me
Elon Musk sees my tweet
it responds to his strategy of media
being where the successful people are
and Elon Musk Tweets in reply he's right
just hold this in your head for a moment
you know this is the model of the world
that I have that some people are players
and some people are NPCs
the other person who has that model is
Elon Musk
where it just seems as though we're in a
simulation and people like Elon Musk can
sort of author the simulation for
ridiculous outcomes
I believe it as well and I believe I
have also routinely changed reality in
ways that just defy all logic so if
we're not a simulation I don't have a
better explanation of what's going on
this young Uber driver
had a very clear intention
to move the universe
he wanted to nudge the universe through
his own success
I got in his car Against All Odds All
Odds
he makes a joke about uh Elon Musk not
wanting to deal with us
Elon Musk
tweets a confirmation
of this kid's 26 years old I call him a
kid of this kid's
system and validates it he validates his
system
now
I don't have a way to contact him
because you know Uber is a first name
kind of thing he might contact me
someday you know just to follow up if he
reads my book or something and I'll let
him know that you know I'll connect the
dots and let another story but what
happens when Elon Musk who has an 125
million followers Etc
what happens when he validates a success
strategy
that you know being around successful
people helps you succeed
is present
this kid actually moves the universe
from his Uber car
without knowing it
someday
that kid's a player he's a player right
you know the only thing I know for sure
is he's not an NPC because he moved the
universe
a little bit just a nudge but he did
that
is that the coolest story you've heard
today
it's early right
yeah it's cool
all right well I don't know if 126
million people saw it but all right that
was your inspirational story for the day
speaking of Elon Musk um I also tweeted
about the wef and I said this I'm
skeptical of anything that can't be
explained in a sentence
what exactly do they do and why
you ever thought of that here's a good
standard for detecting
if somebody can't explain their
situation or what they're offering or
their product in one sentence
is a scam
now the first time you hear that you're
going to say that can't be true there
must be plenty of legitimate things that
are a little hard to explain
nope no they're not there are no
legitimate things that are hard to
explain nope you'll never find one
the only things that are hard to explain
are sketchy things
sketchy things are hard to explain
because you don't want to say the truth
so ask anybody who's Pro World economic
forum
what do they do and why
and then watch what happens it's going
to be word salad
well we like to bring together the
Future Leaders to coordinate and the
communication of the synergies because
then the world can be moving in a way
that's compatible with the future of
both the technology and freedom and
equality and will also have the no
racism and save the world because of
climate change and all good things and
leaders in your community and
right now I'm totally serious
we need to get them on record
saying what is this thing and why is it
why does it exist
where do I send my bunny
right
so
um so after I said I'm skeptical of
anything that can't be explained in the
sentence
um
then Eli Elon Musk was looking at the
same video and he responded because
Klaus Schwab sounds like a bond villain
you all know that right like I'm not the
first person to say that
do you know who else says that Klaus
Schwab the head of the world economic
Forum do you know who else says he
sounds like a bond villain
everybody who hears them
everybody
everybody like we all thought of it at
the same time
is is is that a is that the hand of
Specter
I think that's the Heather Specter like
everybody same time
so that's never a good look right never
good luck but you know in his defense
Klaus Schwab is a Swiss Economist slash
engineer
so a Swiss Economist slash Engineers are
not exactly Mr charisma
go so you got that working against him
but
he talked about uh the WF and the need
to quote Master the future
which Elon Musk said Master the future
doesn't sound ominous at all
yeah and then he says how is the w e f
slash Davos even a thing are they trying
to be the boss of Earth
now that's my point as well right
like
Elon Musk
is a master of the universe you know
he's one of the people who's figured it
out
he's invited to the wef and turned it
down because it sounded boring AF as he
said
he doesn't know what they do
like what like what's the point of this
what exactly are you trying to do here
now you tell me
if Elon Musk who is invited to it can't
figure out why they exist or what they
do are they just trying to be the boss
of Earth
you should worry about that right now
that that's basically another way to say
if you can't explain it in a sentence is
sketchy
now
by by any objective
um reasonable consideration are they not
trying to inject their influence between
the uh the citizens of a country and
their government
that part would be confirmed by both
people pro and con right
that that is a description they're
they're inserting themselves between the
leadership of a country and the citizens
who in the world would agree to that
who in the world would say yes to that
well the fact that it's a non-profit
means little
yeah it just seems like a crazy thing to
be in favor of
so I asked if there's any kind of a
master list on Twitter I asked of people
at least Americans who are attending so
we can know all who all the dumb people
are
doesn't that feel useful wouldn't you
have to like have a master list of who
is gullible enough to go to this thing
well it turns out there are quite a few
of American politicians both the
Republican and Democrat
so it's totally bipartisan it looks like
yeah four Republican governors
uh Kirsten Cinema somebody said Joe
manchin I didn't didn't see his name on
the list but I don't I don't know if
that's true
yeah Christopher Ray the our FBI
director is at the wef
seriously
our FBI director
is attending the organization that wants
to get between our government and the
people
what could be worse than that
like these should be fired for that
I think I think you should be fired for
that like actually fired for that
is that wrong
I think attending that is such a bad
look for the FBI such a bad look
that that's disqualifying I mean that
would be similar to just taking his dick
out and and like pissing on Congress
to me I mean maybe it's not technically
illegal
but I think you should get fired for it
you know it's probably approved by
somebody above him so that's different
but uh I don't approve of that
whatsoever
but anyways nice to have a list that uh
Code Monkey Z who's back on Twitter
do you remember code monkeyz
he's back on Twitter he had a good list
and I think everybody on the list should
be asked in public to explain what the
wef is
and why they attempted oops
sorry I Disappeared there for me so I
think everybody on the American list of
attendees uh yeah Ron Watkins is the
name behind
Code Monkey Z and
some say he was he was beyond queue
I don't know if that's confirmed or not
he is is the name they most often say
anyway
um
I saw I saw a tweet by Rob Reiner today
and I didn't know how to comment on it
because it's now indistinguishable from
parity
I looked at it and I swear I couldn't
tell if he was joking because he keeps
saying that you know Biden has been
proven as all honest unlike Trump and I
think you couldn't possibly be looking
at the news
you look at the same news I look at that
and even even musk said you said talking
about somebody else mentioned
uh
somebody tweeted uh you're saying I
should stay away from trashing Biden
because I'll see more Rob Reiner and
Keith olberman tweets the context here
was uh musk had tweeted that if you
interact with an account you don't like
the Twitter algorithm will give you more
accounts you don't like and then he
laughed because he didn't think that was
necessarily a mistake and I agree if you
enjoyed interacting with an account you
didn't like
why wouldn't it give you more of those
you enjoyed it you spent time on it so
it's a weird little Kink of the
algorithm that'll give you what you
don't want because sometimes you want
what you don't want you know it's like a
confusing little situation so it must
get called that out or uh and he was
agreeing with the sweet and he so
talking about Rob Ryder and Keith
olberman's tweets musk says is it even
possible to parody their tweets I'm just
literally wondering right now if it's
even possible
totally agree like actually literally no
joke no hyperbole I don't know if you
can do it
you know I saw a parody account today
that it took me 10 minutes to decipher
that it was a parody
like I I really couldn't tell I had to
look pretty deep in the Tweet stream I'm
like this could be just a Democrat
and then finally I saw
interacting with uh Michael Knowles and
that like gave away the parody but at
first I I actually couldn't tell it was
way over the top but still you know
Skittle
so if you haven't seen this thread it's
just required geez another
another glitch this is just a required
thread all right now I can't require you
to do anything but I would suggest that
if you don't see the I tweeted a thread
by uh kanakoa the Great
who has a sub stack as well but his
tweet threads are just outrageously good
like better than anything you're seeing
in the news I don't know how
like what his background is right don't
know anything about it but the work is
oh my God it's like better than anything
you're saying in terms of really
describing you know a situation anyway
he's reporting on
I didn't know about any of this but
apparently the the DHS uh Department of
Homeland Security the Outsource
censorship of the internet platforms to
the election Integrity partnership
which was comprised of four
organizations
okay let me stop here
Kenneth coher the great correctly uses
the word comprised
you almost never see that most people
would say it was composed for
organizations which is actually improper
he uses the correct word it was
comprised of
that's actually a tell
for somebody who's operating on at least
a higher level of writing talent and
probably that that spills over into his
reasoning ability
so for organizations the Stanford
internet Observatory the University
of
Washington's Center for an informed
public what the hell is that the
Atlantic council's digital forensic
research lab and something called
Graphica
all right do you see what's going on
they're laundering the censorship
through like organizations
so it's going to look legitimate because
they can say these organizations but
it'd also be so complicated that it's
hard to figure out what's going on
right sort of a perfect cover the
complexity
um
and they said that uh
the EIP
claimed every quote repeat spreader of
election misinformation was on the right
what
every one of the repeat spreaders of
information according to the censors
they were all on the right every one of
them huh
there are very few things that are that
completely binary
and this isn't one of them yeah
obviously there are plenty of tweets of
Hillary Clinton and Democrats and you
know Stacy Abrams
questioning elections
but all of the repeat offenders all of
them were on the right
now here's my question
is that telling you that they were uh
simply political that they knew what
they were doing they knew they were just
being political and that's all it was
because otherwise how do you explain a
hundred percent of all the bad guys
being on the one side according to them
well
I I'm going to propose that there's at
least one other possibility
there is one other possibility
that they believed it
that they believed it
because the left actually believes
everything the left says is actually
true
they actually believe it
so when they look at it they say well it
looks like 100 of the lies are on this
side
that isn't necessarily
purely political
it might actually be that they believe
it
and and by the way that wouldn't even be
unusual
that would require no leap of logic no
believing in something non-scientific it
would be the way normal people act
right you don't think you could get a
bunch of uh Republicans in a room
to say that the only people lying are
the are the Democrats of course you
could
would they be acting only politically
nope no they would actually believe it
right if you put a bunch of Republicans
in the room they would say uh a whole
bunch of conspiracy theories that they
believe are just facts
and they would say these other guys are
just doing garbage the truth is both
sides have a healthy dose of conspiracy
theories and
but if only one side is doing the fact
checking you've got a real big problem
and that's what Kenneth Cole the great
is calling out in great detail so he's
got all the receipts and he shows it in
a way that I just recommend that you
look at the details the the big picture
is that our government was definitely
involved in censorship in a big way
in an important way that probably
influenced elections probably
and uh that they use these cutouts if
you want that's probably the wrong term
but they use these organizations that
are not terribly credible to me anyway
to you know to make this happen and make
it confusing and give us some laundered
legitimacy
so 22 million tweets were labeled
misinformation
none of them on the left
so the left has got a good record
there are 22 million to zero
it's pretty good 22 million to zero
all right this next segment I call
backwards science
backwards science the people who get
cause and effect
backwards or might
so you're going to give you two
situations in which it's entirely
possible that the interpretation is
accurate
maybe the cause and effect is exactly
what they say
but you decide number one
uh there's a new study that says going
for a walk in the park or along a lake
or tree-lined spaces basically in nature
they're doing some exercises in nature
May reduce the need for medications for
anxiety asthma depression high blood
pressure uh as in or insomnia
that physical activity is thought to be
the key mediating Factor when you're out
in these green spaces so it's not just
being there it's it's being active out
there and the study found that visiting
nature three to four times a week was
associated with weight associated with
they didn't even use the word causation
they don't say it's a Cause
disassociated with
so associated with 36 percent lower odds
of using blood pressure pills 33 lower
odds of using mental health medications
and 26 percent lower odds of using
asthma medications
now
let me ask you this question
if you were to divide the world into
people who are already healthy
and people who are not healthy which one
of those do more hiking
do the unhealthy people do as much
hiking as the healthy people
because I wouldn't have to do any
science whatsoever to determine the
people who go hiking
are healthier than people who don't
and I don't need any science to tell me
that
you know why because unhealthy people
don't like
healthy people do
is this probably backward science
don't you think just healthy people go
hiking it's not the hiking people makes
you healthy now of course hiking makes
you healthier let me be clear there's no
question whatsoever it works both ways
right we know it works both ways for
sure it works both ways
but don't you think the bigger factor is
that healthy people can hike and
unhealthy people can't get off the couch
I I'm just going to put it out there
possibility
let's do another one
there is a report out of Australia and
you're not going to believe this but uh
people who are healthy
don't go to the doctors and die
nearly as often as people who are super
unhealthy
did you know that
yeah
well that's what the Australians figured
out that healthy people live longer than
unhealthy people now they didn't say it
that way they said it a little
differently what they said was that the
people who had the most vaccinations and
boosters
were the only ones dying literally the
only ones it was like a subset of a
thousand some people so it wasn't the
biggest study in the world you know so I
think you'd need confirmation but they
found that zero in the period that they
looked at this recent zero unvaccinated
people died in the hospital from covet
zero
not a single unvaccinated person
who do you think got vaccinated the most
was it the people with no comorbidities
who looked perfectly healthy and said to
themselves I'm perfectly healthy and
we're already in the age of Omicron and
if I haven't got vaccinated by now it
would be maybe unwise to do so because
omicron's not going to hurt me I just
ran a marathon
or are you more likely to vaccinated if
you're 400 pounds and you have diabetes
I don't know I think you're more likely
to get vaccinated if you're unhealthy
so to me all it proved is that unhealthy
people die and healthy people do not
the other possibility
is that the Jabs are killing people
which one is it
would you agree that they're both
possible
are they both possible
that the the only explanation is the
Jabs are killing you
or the or maybe the most explanation is
that healthy people didn't get
vaccinated
probably both
probably both do you know why I say
probably both
because we know vaccinations are
dangerous to some people
so if you've got a thousand people well
probably
maybe one of them I don't know not
probably because I think
I don't think one in a thousand are
being killed by a vaccination right it's
not one in a thousand that'd be too much
but you know you could imagine if you
looked at a thousand people you get
maybe one or two
who knows
and I can also imagine if it's uh you
know I'm reasonably healthy but I didn't
tolerate the first two shots at all like
they kicked my ass
if the shot itself kicks your ass and
you're already near death
I'm not too surprised if I kill some
people too
would would that surprise you
if the virus could kill you
and I don't know about you but I felt
just as sick with the shot as I did with
the virus
you know the shot was before Omicron but
when I got Omicron
it kicked my ass but about the same as
the shot did there wasn't that much
difference
so
if you can if you can take out an old
person with just a little bit of Omicron
which is happening
why wouldn't
the vaccination take them out
I mean if it feels just as aggressive
but in a different way
no
just put that out there so I want to be
very clear from the club Birds
I would be worried about this data
yeah this is definitely a flag you
should look at it but you know I always
see Dr McCullough he's always the one
who's on these correlation causation
claims and
he could easily turn out to be right
about everything it's well within the
realm of possibility
but he consistently treats the this kind
of study like there's only one
explanation
there's at least two
at least two there might be more which
is you know bad data bad data would be
the other explanation
well somebody's saying Scott was
Shilling pro-vax in my opinion
what does your opinion have to do with
anything
why does anybody care about your opinion
and I mean it's wrong obviously
but why do we care
as long as you say it's your opinion
don't say it's a fact
right if you say it's a fact well then I
have to bury you
but if you say it's your opinion that's
fine I mean it's an uninformed opinion
based on sketchy data probably but
opinions are fine
[Applause]
all right uh
um I saw you Twitter user Eliza
um who is Eliza blue who is a notable
um
anti-trafficking
advocate so does does important good
work uh of advocacy for groups that need
it the traffic people and and pedophiles
and stuff
uh victims of pedophilia so very
credible
person
doing good work but she asked this
question she said honest question what
happened where men are buying into these
alpha male scams now she didn't say
Andrew Tate
but I feel like she might have been at
least thinking of him a little bit
yeah so honest question what happened to
where men are buying into these alpha
male scams and
then she said what can I do as a woman
to let men know that it's not the move
at least not for me it's not attractive
energy in the slightest
and people had a lot of replies but I I
was I noted this one from Jason Andrews
who was a hypnotist uh by the way and
persuasion Rising is his account if you
like to follow hypnotists and he
responded
this is pretty Savage no I don't endorse
this opinion I'll tell you my opinion in
a moment but it was so Savage I just had
to read it he goes first of all she said
honest question blah blah and he says no
honest person could have lived through
the last 20 to 30 years and not be aware
of why men do this
men true or false You couldn't possibly
have lived to the last 23 20 to 30 years
and be confused at all about why this is
happening
uh then it goes on because he's not done
he goes but you have no standing to tell
men if that is or isn't the right move
because you are not one of them
ouch
yeah yeah I I will endorse that look at
you yes I endorse that opinion now but
to be clear
you know let me defend her as well
she didn't say what you should do she
was she was more about what her
preferences would be so she was saying
if you act like this I don't personally
like it but if you act like this other
thing I would personally like it so I
I'm going to give her a break
yeah I'm going to defend her a little
bit it was more about
there are people who have personal
preferences and maybe that's not their
personal preference so that's fair
but I'm also going to disagree with that
Jason when he says no honest person
could have lived through the last 20 to
30 years and not be aware of it
you don't think men have just as big
blind spots about women
all I see is a giant blind spot
I I don't really see dishonesty all
right but it was a funny comment so you
know it's a good Twitter exchange but
I'm going to defend her a little bit I I
feel like the the explanation is far
more likely to be that men and women
have enormous blind spots about the
other and there's almost no way to fix
it it's just too many of us who are too
confused
so I I definitely uh agree with Jason
about uh maybe men could explain this to
you it wouldn't be that complicated
but I don't think this has changed
should have turned as Savage as it did
because she was really just asking the
question and I do I do appreciate her I
appreciate the work she does and so I
don't want to sound like I'm dumping on
her but uh as a representative
of you know men versus women and you
know what blind spots they have I think
this is just a perfect Exchange
all right I would like to add one thing
to the analysis of Ukraine versus Russia
I'm sure somebody has already said this
probably lots of people but I don't
haven't seen it so I'll say it
when prog when the predictors are
telling us how Russia and Ukraine are
going to turn out
what I hear the most is you don't
understand that Russia can be patient
and they have you know more resources
and they can just just grind on Ukraine
until they get what they want or there's
nothing left so so Russia almost can't
lose
because they'll just grind away and they
don't have to worry about public opinion
and they'll just keep doing it but
Ukraine might run out of people
and maybe the West will you know get
tired of supporting them so if you were
a smart better say some people you'd bet
on the one with the most resources and
staying power
I submit that that's the wrong analysis
because I think the critical thing will
be uh collapse points
in other words both Ukraine and Russia
might be we don't know they might both
be close to collapse
meaning a system collapse a Cascade of
things that makes the whole system
collapse imagine for example
it's easier to imagine the Russian side
but on the Russian side imagine if
there's just too many qualified people
get killed to handle Logistics like
getting the food and the ammunition
let's just say that's the only thing
that goes wrong
that that the Russian army is so
degraded in talent that they have
nothing but literally drunks
to deliver the food and ammunition and
it just stops getting there
that's a system collapse
they still have plenty of food
and they still have plenty of guns and
weapons
but the systems collapsed because it was
just one weak point you only need one
weak point the whole thing collapses
right so
I think both should be looked at as
system collapse problems and a little
less no that's not mind reading
where is their mind reading in this
there's no mind reading in this this is
literally describing a system it's not
even people
no people have been discussed yet
so
um
somebody says that NATO might collapse
first yeah I can see that I can see that
the let's say the support for Ukraine
it could collapse imagine if something
happened to zlenski
game over what happens if we found out
as Lindsay I'm not not suggesting this
but what if we found out he did some
huge corrupt thing or killed some people
right
suddenly the public opinion would just
completely change
and there'd be a system collapse on the
left so you have two entities that are
both very very vulnerable
to Total system collapse if any one you
know Peg gets pulled out of the Jenga
thing
now
you can't ignore the fact
that one of them might run out of
resources to the point where the
collapses that could happen but they're
way more there are way more ways it
collapses than just who has the most
resources that they're applying to it
would you agree with that
would you agree that the system
collapsing is a little under-appreciated
because that's the thing you can't see
until it happens it's invisible until it
happens but everybody can see everybody
can see oh they used up their missiles a
lot of their military is already dead or
injured so that stuff we talk about
because you can see it
but a potential system collapse would
just be one component you wouldn't even
notice until it was going
so just keep that in mind
I think you'll see stories in the future
about
system collapse
uh center of gravity analysis Klaus witz
calls it the critical point culminating
points so that surely this is already
you know military Doctrine right
I mean it's too obvious not to be part
of the military Doctrine is it a
prediction
um
is short of a prediction
is short of a prediction because I we're
definitely Anything Could Happen
situation and I don't believe you know
data that comes out of that area so I
think either side could win at this
point what do you say
would you agree either side could win
it's unpredictable at this point
and then you also have to decide what
winning looks like
right because we disagree what winning
looks like
right I see Stephen saying Russia is
winning for certain well would you say
they're winning for certain if their
economy is forever shut down of the you
know the main economic engine of the
world would that be winning
I don't know
uh what we'll see all right ladies and
gentlemen of YouTube I'm going to say
goodbye for today
and I'll see you tomorrow I'm going to
talk to the locals people privately in
their secret little platform which
you're not invited to well actually you
are invited but you'd have to subscribe
you should also subscribe here there's a
button there hit that button
bye for now
