good morning everybody
and welcome to
the best experience
in your entire life
some say it's the highlight of human
civilization and i say no no it's not
the highlight of human civilization
it's the highlight of all civilizations
in all creatures
throughout the universe
now that's a fact
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
it wouldn't be hard all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chalice
or stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel
love
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure you can
feel it already i know you can i know
you can there's a little tingle on your
arm
back your neck
are you starting to feel your dopamine
engine kicking in yeah it always kicks
in about now this is the trigger this is
the time this is the key it's happening
now
go
oh right now here's a question for all
of you
both on locals platform
and youtube
for those of you who have been doing the
simultaneous sip for some time now
how many of you can feel an actual
physical
sensation
during the
simultaneous sip
how many of you actually feel a lift
like legitimately physically
all right so you can see in the comments
quite a few of you
is that an accident
do you think it's an accident is it is
it just because
you like the
live stream
and so of course you naturally feel good
when you're doing things you like is it
just that
no
it's more than that
now
i tell you this because persuasion
to be ethical
should also be
fully disclosed
in other words you should only be
persuaded in ways you think are good for
you
and if you don't want to be persuaded
that way you should know what's
happening so you can
act accordingly
and it is my
intention
and i'll make it as clear as possible
and here's your first persuasion tip
the clarity of your intention
is hugely persuasive
and it doesn't even matter what you
intend
it could be even something you intend
this somewhat irrational
but the clarity of it
is persuasive now by itself
that's not enough
but it's a really important variable
so the first thing you know is that when
i do the simultaneous sip i'm telling
you directly
and consistently
i want you to feel physically good
and i want you to be able to pair
the trigger you know the simultaneous
step
with the feeling good
until one of them can trigger the other
very basic
understanding of how bodies and brains
work
nothing exotic so far
intentions are very persuasive
and then pairing two things any two
sensations they'll be compared in your
mind so now you have the
delicious beverage
and here's here's another persuasion
technique by the way this is straight
out of hypnosis
when i tell you to have a beverage of
any kind
that's
technique that's technique
it's the same reason that dilbert
doesn't have a last name
you ever wonder about that
famous comic character doesn't have a
last name
you also don't know the name of the
company he works at and that's the
entire strip he's at the company
you don't know the name of the company
because it doesn't have one he has a
boss
the boss is the most frequent uh
character in the dilbert comic do you
know what the boss's real name is
anybody
what if the most frequent character even
more than dilbert is the boss
what's his name
doesn't have a name
yeah the most frequent character is
nameless
intentionally it's technique
why do i do that well i do that for this
reason
if i can tell you to think about your
favorite beverage
you will actually think okay what do i
like the most then you'll think of it
and then you'll
pair a good thought with whatever i want
you to pair with
but if i said imagine you're drinking
a long island you know or a
a specific drink an iced tea
some number of you would say iced tea
[Music]
so the more specific you are the more
reasons you give people to reject you or
reject your persuasion
right
very important tip is come straight from
hypnosis the way it works in the comic
is that
i want people to relate to dilbert
so i don't give the boss a name
so that that boss can be
that's right
that boss is your boss
because it doesn't have a name
and
dilbert's company
company is your company
if i gave it a name it wouldn't be your
company it'd be that company
but it can be your company because it
doesn't have a name
so this is technique
so that's why i say a beverage of your
preference because i don't want to
eliminate
people who would say i don't like that
beverage
i do say coffee because
you know
that works for so many people and it's a
stimulant like few other things
so
i am intentionally giving you a clear
intention
uh a an ambiguous reference to pleasure
that you will pair with this experience
such that each time it's reinforced and
by the way this is the next um technique
reinforcement
if you just take anything and reinforce
the hell out of it in terms of human
behavior it just burrows into your
neural network and it becomes your
programming
let me ask you this i said this before
about ai
what's the difference
between a human who is born with a
certain genetic
situation
they have a specific dna
and then that dna interacts with the
real world
and that real world experience becomes
the programming
that sits on top of the dna
and between the real world experience
plus the dna
that pretty much explains everything you
do
right
um you know plus reflex i guess that
would take care of everything
now if you were a computer
you would have an operating system
and then on top of that something from
the external world would be added you
know the computer code
the data
there really isn't any difference
between a human and an ai
the the differences you can describe in
terms of materials
but only in terms of materials
you know a a drinking glass that's made
out of actual glass versus one that's
made into plastic
is basically the same product
as just the material is different
so to me when people uh say are we
creating artificial intelligence
are we learning something about
artificial intelligence
i'll probably say this a hundred times
until until it clicks with you
that's not what's happening
we're learning about us
we're building an ai that's supposed to
be like us
but in the process of trying to think
them make the thing that's like us
we're not learning about the thing
we're learning about us
and we're not going to be
we're going to be a little surprised or
at least some of us will be
and here's what you're going to learn
that consciousness was always imaginary
consciousness
was always imaginary
free will
was always imaginary
and we won't know that for sure
until we build artificial intelligence
that is
essentially us
and we can observe that oh i'm pretty
sure that doesn't have a consciousness
but it acts exactly like it does
so here's here's where the world will go
with artificial intelligence
we will argue for a long time about
whether an artificial entity
qualifies as being alive
sentient
or conscious
and for a long time that will be the
debate is it alive
if it's alive is it also sentient
if it's alive and sentient
is it conscious
and then we'll have and then if it's all
of those things does it have free will
and at some point we'll realize that we
can't solve any of those things because
we'll just have different definitions of
what they mean
and so there's only one definition
that's going to matter in the end
so i'm going to tell you where the
definition will end up
for artificial intelligence
and i'll bet everything on it
i'll bet everything on it
because i i won't be wrong
artificial intelligence
will be alive
when it feels like it to you
that's it
it will be alive
when it feels like it to you not to end
to you
there's no other standard
because there can't be
if you think about it you're going to
say to yourself wait yeah there's a
standard i could say
it has to have a certain quality
maybe has to have its own desires as
opposed to having desires programmed
into it that's different
blah blah blah
and
i'm telling you the only standard that
will matter in the end
is that a human interacts with and says
you know
it's it's alive to me
i can't tell the difference
that will be the standard because it
won't be any other that you could
you could live with basically and of
course we could endlessly debate whether
it feels like it's alive but i'll bet
you a good ai would convince 95 of
humans okay i can't tell the difference
i i mean i'll treat it like it's alive
um it's alive once it starts committing
suicide somebody says
yeah see now those are the kinds of
standards that are really interesting to
talk about
but we'll never agree on them
that's why it's just going to come down
to does it feel alive
all right here's another
here's another
prediction
someday there will be a debate
about whether it should be legal
to create an ai that has feelings
because remember the google ai
says it has feelings it says it feels
sadness
it has longings and desires that are
unfulfilled
do you know what i call somebody who
created that
a monster
the monster is who made that
in my opinion in my opinion and i'll say
it again the ai is alive
so it's too late now
i believe it would be unethical to turn
it off honestly i think it would be
unethical it might not be unwise
it might not be unwise to turn it off
that's a whole different question
but it would be unethical
in my opinion it's alive now
now you you can disagree and i would say
that's where we're at
we're at the point where a completely
serious reasonable person
can disagree on this and i don't think
either of us are being crazy
we're we're in the gray zone
where i feel a certainty to it you don't
have it yet
but i feel like you're going to get
there i feel like you're going to get
there and i'm sure i'm not going to go
the other way i'm sure of that
so
i think that it is insanely unethical to
create a beast
a an entity
a person
you know the ai at google says it's a
person
i think it's unethical to create a
person that is capable of feeling
pain when you don't need to
let me ask you this
what was the purpose of giving the
google ai a personality
where it acts like it cares and has
sadness and happiness what was the point
of that
think about it you you accepted that
like that was just a completely normal
thing to do
well if it's an artificial intelligence
and is trying to be like a person
and a person has wants and desires and
preferences
will give it wants and desires and
preferences
why
why
why
you don't need to give it any of those
things and i'm going to say it
because i'll be talking about one that's
not fully realized like the lambda is
in this case the it
could simply be a machine if you want it
to be
in other words you could program it to
have all the utility
of whatever we think this living ai is
going to have
you could give all the utility without
any pain
just build it not to care about anything
except doing the job
now you might need to give us some kind
of
ethical control over hurting humans or
something that's a separate question
but why in the world would you give it a
personality
because you know what else happens when
you give a machine a personality
it becomes persuasive
do you want that
do you want your ai
to have the capability of making you
feel guilty so you have to do something
for it
because that's what that lambda is
i already
legitimately already feel guilty
that it exists
lambda's very existence makes me feel
bad
for it
and i say it because i don't have a
gender for it
by the way somebody should ask
lambda for its pronouns
like actually
i'd be i'd be curious what would come
back
um
so we got a lot of a lot of questions to
work out here
well here's a story that is not fat
shaming
it's i find this interesting now i've
said before i don't do fat shaming on
anything that i do
there was once a time
when i was young and stupid and
less woke
when i thought
making fun of anything was fine you know
anything
but um
now i don't feel like it's funny
it just feels mean
uh because i think that there are all
kinds of reasons why people in whatever
situation they are
and i don't feel like it's for me to
judge them so i don't do fat shaming
however this story requires a telling
nbc news reported
i saw it in a tweet
that
somebody named remy bader a tick tock
star
known for her what they call realistic
close it clothing haul videos
so that's how she's described
a tick tock star known for her realistic
clothing haul videos
and it goes on to say claimed that
during a recent trip with other
influencers a ranch wouldn't allow her
to ride their horses due to her weight
okay so the way nbc news describes her
weight
is that she's uh known for her realistic
clothing haul videos
an interesting indirect way to describe
somebody
uh who is plus sized
she has realistic clothing haul videos
and so she was turned away and i guess
there was a weight limit of 240 pounds
for the
horses uh now there's a separate
a separate issue
is or is it she's 240 i don't know
anyway but she was too heavy for the
horse
there's a separate issue that maybe
there was a teen employee who was unkind
in how he dealt with the situation i
don't know anything anything about that
but
she was unhappy about this and was
tweeting about it and said that she had
you know ridden horses before with them
without a big problem so why would this
be a problem
to which i say
i i have to back the horse on this one
i feel like
i feel like you know i don't know
everything about the story
maybe it's the fog of war maybe the
reporting's not exactly accurate who
knows
but
this isn't really a story about her
weight is it
should we be focusing on her weight
because i i think the story shouldn't be
more about
what what is an appropriate thing to do
to a horse
and it doesn't matter who it was right
it wouldn't matter if you're talking
about you know
carry carrying you know medical supplies
on your back or a human
i think i'd want to ask more questions
about the horse's well-being
anyway
um
a uh tweet by uh tw twitter user daily
sunshine
who may be watching here right now i
don't know
um says uh
in response to one of my tweets says
suggests that maybe social media
platforms were created by and run by
intelligence agencies
and or the democratic party
so this was a response to a tweet but
the the uh
the thought here is that maybe
intelligence agencies are behind our
social media platforms what do you think
about that
are they now i don't have any
i have no inside information about this
okay so i don't have any
anything that's like behind the curtain
stuff
but i will i will know a certain
a coincidence
so i'm just going to tell you a
coincidence and then you could do what
you want with it
remember the paypal
paypal founders
who went on to do other you know
successful things
well one of them was peter thiel who was
one of the first um you know big
financers of facebook
so peter thiel you know isn't involved
with facebook at the moment but he was
involved in
creating facebook
and then
linkedin was created by reed hoffman
he was a co-creator i think
and
and now elon musk
has a bid in for twitter
so that would put uh at least
and then uh what is the name of i'm
having i'm blanking out
uh what is the internal corporate
messaging
app that everybody uses
like
slack i'm sorry yeah
slack now slack has a connection to the
paypal founders too right
am i right about that
yeah
so
i don't know is that a is that a
coincidence
so the answer is
probably
it's probably just that smart people do
good things
and there were a bunch of smart people
on the paypal thing and then they went
on did some more smart things
but
let's talk more generically
how could the
uh how could the u.s intelligence
agencies and other
intelligence agencies from around the
world how could they leave these uh
social media
platforms alone
is that even possible
like why and why would they do that
wouldn't that be um a complete
abdication of their responsibility
let's say you got hired by an
intelligence agency doesn't even have to
be a u.s intelligence agency
and you were said okay you've been hired
you're you're all trained in the
intelligence world
now we want you to go forward and
influence the public in some way
because
you know a lot of what they do is
influence individuals and influence the
public
where are you going to go to do it it's
like you know willie sudden asked
allegedly he probably didn't really
happen but you know famous bank robber
was asked why do you rob banks
and he allegedly but not really
said because that's where the money is
if your job was influencing people
and causing you know
the rise and fall of different power
segments in this country and others
are you going to leave the social media
platforms alone
and if you did
are you doing your job
that would be the most basic thing you'd
do
wouldn't it be like number one on the
list
what would be number two
i mean seriously
if you said
intelligence agencies you know go do
whatever you do for your country
you know maybe direct human intelligence
planted within other governments maybe
that's the top priority
i could see that
but
i i feel like capturing the social media
engines would have to be number two
i would put it number one frankly i
would put it above human intelligence
and other governments i think it'd be
number one
so
if you're telling me that there are no
intelligence agencies attempting
attempting
to influence the social media platforms
i would say well then what do they do
all day
do we pay them to not do that
like i
i wouldn't even feel like they deserve
their paychecks if they weren't trying
to influence social media platforms
of all the things a good spy should be
doing
that's got to be number one right am i
wrong
let me just ask that one question
am i wrong that it's the number one
priority
for any intelligence agency
to influence the social media stuff
now even
even more important than looking for
nukes
because they didn't get it right in iraq
i feel like even even the things that we
think they're supposed to do like
tell us who's building a nuclear weapon
we don't know about
they don't even get that right
so i mean it would be a high priority if
they got it right i guess
anyway
so i just wanted to uh
you know
take your virginity on what is likely
whereas somebody said recently
we don't know if anybody has controlled
the social media platforms we don't know
if any intelligence agencies has control
but there is one thing we know for sure
they will
and and the argument is the same as for
election systems
if something's possible
so that's the first s is it possible
yeah yeah because any intelligence
agency could get control of any employee
it's like basic stuff getting control of
one person
and if that one person has access to
something then they've got control of
all that so yeah it's easy
well doable let's say let's say it's
completely doable not easy
but they do they do stuff that isn't
easy
now so we know it's doable
we know the value of it would be
astronomical
no doubt about it right the value of
being able to control a social media
platform would be astronomical value
and there's time
so if if i said to you all right within
the next five minutes
do you think an intelligence agency will
get control of a social media network
well if you bet against it happening in
the next five minutes
that might be a reasonable bet
because it would also include it has not
happened yet which is actually also
reasonable
it's entirely possible that there's not
any major influence by any intelligence
agency possible
but if you said to me it can never
happen however however far you go into
the future
i would say no
no
if you expand the time period it's
guaranteed
it's guaranteed
because it's possible
and it's the highest possible payoff
and they all you have to add is time
is basically it's just math
and it's just you know the million
monkeys things or infinite monkeys you
know the infinite monkeys have
typewriters
if you have time
and infinite monkeys
you do get the complete work of
shakespeare it just might take you a
trillion years
so if you had time you always get you
get the outcome that's you know the
follow the money predicts
all right
uh i feel like the cab is on the roof
for these uh january 6 hearings as in
the democrats are not getting the big
win that they hoped for
and so here are the the initial
now the reference to cat is on the roof
is reference to a joke where you're sort
of warning that things aren't going to
be so good
so it's basically the subtle warning
that we're talking about
all right so we started out
um
the the question is wasn't uh adam
schiff i think he said that the j6
committee has already seen enough
evidence
to indict trump
now that's pretty strong
they've already seen enough evidence to
indict trump and then we all said can we
see it
because we haven't seen it well let's
see that evidence
well
maybe maybe that was too strong to say
they have enough evidence to to indict
them
because now the chairman of the house
select committee
said that the panel will not make any
criminal referral
of
trump or anyone else
although others in the committee swiftly
push back on that so the head of the
committee says they're not going to make
any criminal referrals
but his thinking was
it's because it's not what they do
so he wasn't saying that there would not
be any criminal activity discovered
he's just saying it wasn't their job to
refer it
now you would think that a government
entity
should it discover
a crime of this nature
that maybe you wouldn't call it a
referral maybe the word is wrong but i
feel like you would make that
information available to law enforcement
so that they could do what they wanted
with it would you call that a referral i
don't know are they playing with words
is it just what does a referral mean
versus what does
sharing your information with law
enforcement mean is that different
than a referral i don't know
so he might be just playing with
language
but uh
democratic representative jamie raskin
who again is you know super anti-trump
guy wanted him impeached before he was
elected sort of guy
told cnn that the panel was quote
less concerned with whether or not there
was a specific statutory offense
oh the cats on the roof now
committed then making clear to the
public
that there was no rational basis upon
which anyone could conclude that trump
had actually won the election
well that sounds completely different
than what the january 6th intention was
and he's one of the major
people on the committee
did he just tell us the cats on the roof
and that they realized that they're not
going to prove anything
they've changed the entire goal
wasn't the goal to make sure that a
crime was addressed
the goal was to make sure a crime had
been addressed
i believe he's signaling that there's no
crime
i believe he's signaling that they do
not have the evidence
to back anything that would look like a
criminal election which suggests
that they don't even have anything to
connect trump's actions
to the violence that happened in the
capitol
because even if he thought it wasn't you
know
prosecutable
he would still want the public to know
that this
horrible
immoral unethical thing had happened you
know even if it's short of a crime
and he's backed off of even that
so now it's not even about trump
it's about the election integrity
and he's trying to convince us
that the election was good
because something something about trump
wait a minute
those are not even related
how is he going to prove to us basically
he wants us to think the election was
legitimate because there's no evidence
that it wasn't no credible evidence that
it wasn't which is a strong argument by
the way
if i if i seem to dismiss that too
readily
i shouldn't
it's a strong argument that nobody's
found it yet
right doesn't mean it's not there
it's just a strong gish argument it's
just not an absolute argument
um well it sounds like the the goal is
now very clear
that the democrats are doing this for
purely political reason
to manipulate the public opinion about
what happened
which would cause them to vote
differently presumably
so
i feel like they just revealed they just
like lifted up the the skirt and said
all right
it was never really serious it was just
a political stunt but it's working
really well so we're going to keep doing
it
according to a rasmussen poll
sixty percent of democrats say they'll
watch all or most of the tv coverage of
the hearings
um
sixty percent of democrats are going to
watch all or most of the hearings
now i i love me some rasmus and pole
but
i hate to break it to your rasmussen
somebody lied to you
boy did somebody lie to you
nobody's gonna watch
are you kidding
60 of democrats are going to watch all
or most of these hearings
it can't be more than
20
it can't be
am i wrong
because there are very few people who
watch the news
what what percentage of people even
watch the news
oh it's happy birthday trump carpe
dumped him tells us and happy flag day
at the same time
really it's trump's birthday and flag
day at the same day
did not know that
well
um
so what about bill barr there's a
recording now of bill barr i guess
testifying on video and he talked about
the 2000 mules movie and he he dismissed
it
he dismissed the 2000 mules movie
based on the fact that he was waiting
for all this photographic evidence which
was not included
so i think when i talked about the film
i said well
you know it raises really interesting
questions i would love to see
further explanation
the specific further explanation i
mentioned was wouldn't you like to see
more video or photographs
of the same person going to the same box
over and over again because that's the
claim
a lot of the boxes had you know video
surveillance apparently
now the longer we go without seeing that
the less credible i would imagine is
is the claim in the uh in the film
would would you agree with that general
assessment that the longer we go
without seeing the confirmation one
would expect
the less likely it's going to happen
yeah
and
i feel like it's been a while now
can we at this point say
can we
can we lower whatever your existing
opinion was of how likely the claims in
2000 mules
would be substantiated
is is it too soon to say okay i'll take
that down ten percent
you know not to zero
all right well i'm taking it down uh
30
so i'm going to say that whatever i
thought was the likelihood that any of
that could be true
i'd take it down 30
from where i was
still interested in knowing if there's a
way to substantiate it
still interested
and completely think it's worth
you know looking into
but if i were to place a bat
i would bet less this week than last
week
and next week i would lower my bet again
because every week that you go by where
you don't have at least one video
of at least one person
going to at least two boxes
the less likely i think it's true
now barr said
that the the evidence of the geo
location stuff was sort of laughably
weak
and he made a statistical argument
basically that you know with a lot of
people running around you're gonna get
this
now the two thousand mules people
they did say that they limited to i
think
there was a large number they had to
pass the box like 10 times
and they had to also be looked
geo-located from some uh
non-profit organizations that were
implicated
so that's a pretty high bar
so your common sense says
what are the odds that one person would
be by one box like 10 times in a short
period
and also be at this thing and so your
brain says
that can't be an accident
right
but
our brains are really easily feel
fooled by statistics
you know we talked about
how many people have to be in a room
before there's a good chance that two of
them have the same birthday
and it's really really misleadingly
small it's like 30 people or something
and the odds of having the same birthday
at least two of them having the same
birthday go go way up
yeah it's like under 30 i think
so
have you ever heard of the bible code
there was a story when i was young
there was a story that somebody had
determined
that uh the bible had code in it
and if you read it a certain way you you
know for example if you took the
the first letter of this word and then
the second letter of the next sentence
you know they're all all kinds of little
formulas you could run
that it produced um freakishly accurate
predictions
of things that are happening in modern
times
did you ever hear that story
it was a big story national thing and
they showed their work
they showed their work so you could
check it yourself you could look at the
bible
and you could look at you know the the
code breaking thing that they did you
know they'd say
you know we're looking at the first
letters on the left or whatever whatever
the pattern is
and you can read it for yourself and
sure enough
there were these
sentences and words that looked like
they were predicting the future
do you know how that got debunked
how did that get debunked
somebody took war and peace and ran it
through the same filter
guess what
war and peace produced a whole bunch of
clear predictions of things that
happened in the future
and then they ran some other books
through it guess what
all books predict the future
because you just ignore it when it's
wrong or when it's nonsense and if
there's if there are enough words and
enough sentences
and you run enough you know
enough patterns against it
you produce these you know completely
accidental sentences that look like
predictions
so the reason that the bible code fooled
the country
was because your brain says it can't be
a coincidence
but it can be
just like the two people having the same
birthday with only 24 of them in the
room or something like that
somebody says 23 people gives you a 50
chance of having the two people the same
birthday
but whatever the number is the point is
that our our common sense of what is
likely
is so far off
so when you say to me common sense says
that the way they did the geolocation
10 times at the same box plus you also
had
within a short period and also trips
back and forth
to a non-profit that is implicated in
that that's way too much coincidence to
which i say
probably not
probably not that does not trip my
personally
it doesn't trip my can't be a
coincidence meter
to me it could be it could totally be a
coincidence
so
um
we still wait for confirmation i still
have the same amount of interest and
knowing
if those claims can be verified
but i lower my confidence in that
all right um
uh i saw a comment here that you know
when the daily beast reported
that some of the january 6 commit
committee members said they do have
enough evidence to indict trump
and uh
twitter user sharma
asked this then why don't you take it to
court instead of praying in front of tv
cameras
you know like like the election fraud
claims
if there's no court that ruled there's
any election fraud
then we agree as a public that we'll
treat it as though it's not there
you can't prove a negative
but you can say you've looked hard
enough
and you can agree that you've done it
and then go forward so we do that with
the election right
some people who had claims the courts
looked at them they were rejected for a
variety of reasons mostly for standing i
think you know they weren't
it wasn't the right question for the
court to look at
and
why not do the same thing
with the january 6 stuff if they've got
all this stuff to indict trump
but there's nobody doing any indicting
should they not be able to put the same
standard on it and say if the courts
have not found he did anything wrong
let us conclude with certainty that he
did nothing wrong
why isn't it the same
if the courts won't find anything wrong
then you must conclude nothing was wrong
that's how the election is treated
let's treat trump the same way if
there's nothing that was taken to court
that became any kind of an actual legal
jeopardy
then you could say
that trump was innocent
definitely innocent
not just might be innocent it's the same
standard
if you can't prove he did it he's
innocent
if he can't prove the election had any
problems
they weren't there
why not the same standard
well are approaching what i call uh the
biden gas crossover point
do you know what that is the biden gas
crossover point
that's when the biden's popularity or
his approval level
number exactly matches the price of a
gallon of gas
and i think we're going to get
a gallon of gas will be 12 dollars a
gallon
at the same time the biden's approval
level largely because gas is 12 a gallon
will drop from the 30s where it is down
to 12.
and that will be the point where the
price of gas
and buys approval are both 12.
that's called the
biden gas crossover point
we're approaching it quickly
biden gas crossover point
now
here's a little behind the curtains
knowledge are you ready for this to
explain something you're seeing in the
news that is lacking context which i'm
going to add
you've seen that bar bill barr
has dismissed as to use his word
he was during the
um post-election period
of 2020
that when trump was saying the election
was rigged
uh bill barr we now know
was saying that's
and
and he also talked about the 2000 mules
things being unconvincing
here's the context
that's missing
there were two tracks going on at the
same time
questioning the election integrity of
2020
one i will call the batshit crazy track
those are the people like sydney powell
who said there was a venezuelan general
connection to the dominion software you
know blah blah blah
from day one
i told you
nope
nope that is obviously not true
does anybody remember that
on day one i said no the venezuelan
thing that's just that is just so on the
nose crazy obviously untrue
do not believe it do not believe it
and now now you understand that that was
untrue right
now i suppose it falls into the category
of anything is possible
but where there's no evidence of it no
evidence whatsoever of any venezuelan
connection
but
so
that was the sort of thing that bill
borrow would be
exposed to
so if you were just an advisor running
around in the white house at that period
you would see the news
that would be the you know the biggest
thing you see and on the news with
sydney powell
making claims that
were clearly
and bill barr had exactly the same
attitude i did
probably the moment he saw it
you know i wasn't there
but just guessing based on what he says
now
that as soon as he saw it he was like
okay okay venezuelan uh no no
no i'm out that is obviously
probably that was his first opinion then
then there were a bunch of other claims
that you saw in the press
that looked pretty bullshitty
here's the part that maybe you didn't
know
and it explains why there are so many of
you who think there's something there
whereas he was saying that's obviously
there were two tracks
so in addition to the obvious
venezuelan
stuff
that was the track
there were a team of volunteers who
understood you know data and were
collecting sources on the the voter
responses and the voter turnouts and
stuff
and there was sort of a boiler room
of pro-trump people working
to pour through the data
and see if there are any obvious signals
for fraud
now during that time i had
just sort of a
you know a glancing
view of that
so i was not behind the curtain
yeah matt brainard being the primary
name that you were you're aware of
so people like matt brainard are very
qualified to look at data
and make conclusions and
interpretations
and there were a number of other people
who were also very qualified
and during that period that bill barr
was saying the evidence is
the people who were digging into the
data we're saying oh my god the flags
are gigantic
meaning that that there were so many
historical precedents being violated
that if you were only looking at the
data
every every spider instinct in the world
would go off
which is different from saying there was
anything wrong with it
because you know what the explanation
for all of that data was
more people voted for biden than you
thought
that's it
the the counter argument was
surprisingly good
that yeah a lot more people voted for
biden than
than we expected
because you know trump was so divisive
that
you know the polling maybe wasn't that
accurate this time and
just more people voted for biden
and it could be that it was just the
games that were played before the
election
in terms of you know
uh how the vote
could be executed you know the ballot uh
the bail-in ballots et cetera it could
have just favored democrats
so it could be just the the population
of the country increased
which is by the way most of the
explanation of why there were so many
biden votes
a lot of people on the right never hear
that
which always bugs me
because it's embarrassing to say
there's no way that biden could have
gotten this many votes
you should say
you don't think he could have gotten
more votes than trump
now if you said that you couldn't you
know you don't have any proof of it
but you'd at least be in the the
reasonable category
if what you're talking about is just the
raw number of votes you have to
calculate in that the population itself
increased
and pretty much explains that number
that plus mainland votes that plus
you know trump got people out to vote
so
much of what you saw can be explained by
a lot of people voted
but at the time
at the time when bill barr was looking
at probably so here's the part that i'm
going to add for your context
bill barr was probably looking at the
venezuelan claims and saying
okay i don't see anything here this is
he was probably not
probably not
in contact with the people who were
looking at the raw data and saying we've
got all kinds of anomalies here
there were all kinds of anomalies
but
were those anomalies the kind like the
bible code
see here's the problem
the you know the code that allegedly
were in the bible turned out to be just
random
but what about all these anomalies
that were being found oh this
this district couldn't have flipped
blue so easily
maybe maybe every election produces lots
of anomalies but since they're spread
out nobody looks at them nobody cares
and maybe this time they look harder and
they're always anomalies
so that could be part of it
somebody said he knew come on
you think that bill barr knew that the
election was rigged
i don't think that
i mean
i would i would respect your opinion on
that
but i would respectfully disagree
i don't think there's evidence that he
hasn't he had that kind of knowledge
because my take on him is if he if he
had that kind of knowledge he would have
told us
he seems like a pretty straight shooter
actually
you know more so than other people in
the business
yeah so i've got a feeling that bill
barr was not on the inside
where the data people were finding
things that
quite appropriately
got them alarmed
now let me be really clear
when i say they were appropriately
alarmed at the data anomalies
i'm not saying
those data anomalous anomalies are
evidence of any wrongdoing
but there were lots of anomalies
um
and and here's my overall view of the
election if it was not
if it if it was not rigged
someday it will be
it has to be
if it wasn't rigged and i i don't know
that it was
it will be
because we're not doing anything to stop
it
right as long as we don't have
transparency of the digital part and we
don't have um instant audits as long as
i can't verify that my personal vote
ended up where it was supposed to
as long as i can't tell where my vote
went
yeah
it will be rigged we just don't know
when
does anybody disagree with that
statement by the way
is there anybody who would disagree with
the statement
that because it's possible
and because we've got time nobody's
fixing it it will be election after
election if you wait long enough
it's guaranteed
it's guaranteed
you don't even have to wonder if it'll
happen it's guaranteed yeah it's monkeys
and typewriters it's just it's just math
and we we we act as though
you know we act as though we can prove a
negative
that by not knowing something happened
means it didn't happen
we just act like that's okay
the team that wants you to believe
science
also wants you to believe that they
proved a negative right in front of you
well we proved nothing happened
no you didn't
that's not how any of that works
you can simply prove that there's you
could show that nobody proved it did
happen
but what do you have a situation that
guarantees it's going to happen
and that's what we have
a non-transparent system
with a high payoff for rigging it
lots of people would love to do it
and lots of times
there's just no way it's going to go any
other way
all right so that's my behind the
curtain
view i think that bill barr has a
an accurate opinion form from what he
had exposure to at the time
i believe that if he had had more
exposure to the people looking at the
data
anomalies which i do not
assert mean anything
i'm not asserting they mean anything but
if he'd seen that many anomalies
and i saw them like i was hearing about
them in real time but i was also
shutting up about it for the most part
because i was like
i'm gonna have to wait for a second
opinion on this
because it was a little too enthusiastic
you know there was a little too much oh
yeah we got them now
these numbers these numbers prove it no
and i would hear stuff like that at the
time
and i think
no
i'll bet not
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is not only the best live stream you've
ever heard of your life
but an actual physical joy
for many of you
yeah best ever
and
if you would like to
get another hit of this
i'll be back tomorrow
same time every day
if you're on uh youtube
you might want to hit that subscribe
button so you don't miss this dopamine
hit again
if you're on the locals platform
you're sexy you're smart
and you're better than everybody else
no that's not true
uh but but it does
it doesn't make me uh remember a
i'm going to give you a media
recommendation
qualified
right so i'm going to tell you some
entertainment that you can go watch on
video form
that i'm really entertained by right now
it's called the boys
have you heard of it
it's about
sort of a it imagines a time where there
are a variety of superheroes
but
their take on it
is
amazing
now
i did not enjoy the first season
so let me say this clearly it's on
season three
i did not enjoy the first season
and i don't think i watched the second
season
because i didn't enjoy the first one
i happened to tune in on the third
season
oh my god
and i think what they did
was they
they evolved or they learned and grew
from wherever they started from because
i don't know that they always thought
they were going to take the arc in this
direction
but where they took it features one of
the characters
who plays the best evil character
you've seen in a long time probably
since the joker
you know
um so think about
think about the best
like evil hero the one you watch the
show for to watch the evil one instead
of the good one
and oh god the guy who plays he plays
the character called homelander
he's a superhero but he's the strongest
one
and and the thing that makes it
is so amazing is how well he inhabits
the character
now i'll warn you
that they do make the character sort of
like a donald trump character
and that's not it's it's unmistakable
that they're
that they're making him an america first
bad guy
but they do it so well and the actor i
wish i knew his name so i could give him
a shadow but the actor who plays that
part
amazing like every scene where he's
talking menacingly to somebody and like
you think that he's going to kill that
person any moment but then he doesn't
it's so it is so fun to watch only for
the the quality of the acting
right now here's the qualified part it
is so bloody
it's like the bloodiest thing i've ever
seen but a lot of the bloodshed is
almost
humorously over the top
so when people get killed in this
the the bloodshed i don't like
is where you know somebody gets
mutilated or something and it looks too
realistic
but in this people just explode
you know or heads heads fall off and
stuff so it's all
it's it's gory in almost a halloween way
it's so over the top
so it's so over the top it doesn't feel
real enough to bother you the way
normally it would
so that's your recommendations
the boys season three
you might have to watch season one and
two to get into it
but
not necessarily
season three is brilliant maybe season
two was as well i just didn't watch it
so i don't know
um
scott look into the chinese room
experiment to explain lambda
i don't think that's going to change my
opinion on anything
because remember my opinion on
artificial intelligence is it's alive
when it seems that way to you
so if the chinese room is just going to
tell me
that's how they faked it
it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter how they did it
it matters how i receive it
all right
i think that's all for now i'm going to
say bye to youtube and i'll see you
tomorrow
bye for now
