of tanker gels or steiner can't take a
trigger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
yeah including the legal system
why not go
i feel justice breaking out all over the
place
plenty of it if you are sitting around
tonight and saying to yourself
what could i do in the middle of this
pandemic
what type of entertainment can i find
that's in my own house without even
leaving the house
and the answer is you should watch uh
the greg gutfeld show
tonight because i'm on it
not alone of course other wonderful
people on it too
you know the show check your local
listings
and you will be delighted
so that's the greg gutfeld show tonight
so i'll be on that as a guest
the big news unless you watch the fake
news
is that lawyer kevin kleinsmith
is being indicted for falsifying
evidence
that continued the the investigation
onto
carter page which we know now
was all a bunch of bs
and i ask you this if you have a
high-level lawyer
working for the fbi
and this high-level lawyer falsifies
documents to keep a guy under
surveillance
and risk his life in the larger service
of overthrowing the legal
government of the united states just
going to put this
out there shouldn't that be the death
sentence
because it's a weird thing because it's
sort of a
it feels blue-collar or white collary
you know it's like if you change
some words on a document
well that's not so bad right i mean it's
not like you
murdered somebody is it
but it kind of is it kind of is closer
to murdering somebody
because that's the whole point of
treason
treason doesn't say you murdered this
one person
it says you created a situation that is
so dangerous for the country
that the entire your republic is in
danger
so this one lawyer did a crime
which in my opinion put the entire
republic at risk
that in terms of how bad it is
potentially you know he got caught but
in terms of how bad it is potentially
it's treason level you know i
i don't think there's any chance that
the death penalty could be
you know actually used but it's trees
level
so i'll just put that out there
apparently
the msnbc and cnn they don't they don't
think this is a big story
[Laughter]
it's by far the biggest story but
the you're watching it in real time and
it's probably blowing your mind
that the press can make anything
important
seem like it's completely unimportant
and they can take something that's
completely
unimportant and blow it into something
that looks like it's the big national
story
and you stand there and you look at it
objectively and you think to yourself
are we spending all our time on the
unimportant stuff
and the answer is yeah we are we're
a little bit more on that in a bit
bill mitchell got banned from twitter i
understand
uh jack passovic was reporting on this
on twitter
and this was jack's information he said
that
bill mitchell first received a seven-day
ban for tweets talking about
mask dangers then was using a second
account to tweet during the ban and had
his main account permanently suspended
now i i blocked
uh bill mitchell a long time ago
now i i think he's a nice guy i've been
on his show a few times
and he's very nice personally so it's
not a personal thing
but i blocked him because his
his certainty on a medical thing
just is not good
right now yeah
i wouldn't i wouldn't have necessarily
banned him from twitter i don't know if
that's something i would have done
but i certainly banned him from my life
because i didn't want
you know i didn't want to interact with
someone who was not a medical
professional
who had certainty about a medical thing
it's just not good right now i'm
perfectly okay with anybody who
tweets a study that turned out not to be
valid
that would be every one of us on twitter
there's nobody on twitter
who has that one time or another
retweeted a story that turned out to be
false a study that turned out to be not
reproducible
that's just sort of every day on twitter
but
most of us don't sell it as a fact
most of us would say well here's this is
interesting
or these people say this uh once you
cross over into i'm telling you the
facts
listen to me people you're probably on
shakier ground
so i don't know the full details of this
but i'm guessing
that bill mitchell was saying something
as a medical
fact when maybe maybe we shouldn't be
speaking in terms of certainty
but we'll see i guess more information
that will come out
all right here's my favorite stupid
story of the day
now as the creator of the dilbert comic
you know my filters are turned for
corporate behavior that's a little bit
ridiculous
and i've always wondered will there be a
day
sometime in the future where there'll be
some company that's so big and so
unwieldy that has so many
moving parts so big the bureaucracy
that it would someday sue itself
right that sounds silly right would a
company ever get so big
that it wouldn't know that it was suing
itself well something like that's
happening
and i thought i would share it with you
so
the aclu is
first of all it's backing china uh
saying that tick tock
and wechat the two chinese apps
that are under review for being banned
in this country
it looks like they will be banned and
the aclu is
trying to stop that what
the aclu is trying to stop a national
security
uh decision by the commander-in-chief
what
these are not american companies and
nobody's saying that these products
can't exist
they just can't exist under the control
of our nemesis who wants to destroy our
country
now if that doesn't make you think
that the aclu is lost all credibility
i would add this little little factoid
the aclu gets a lot of its funding from
google for example so google
is one of the main you know big funders
of the aclu
google of course is maybe a little bit
friendly
which i know so what do you make of the
fact that google
is maybe a little bit friendly with
china and is funding the aclu
and the aclu is siding with china
over the united states now they wouldn't
put it that way but
that's the way it looks to me because
even if you know even if this is like a
gray area
it's still the united states call how
much risk we're willing to take
it's not up to china to decide how much
risk the united states takes
they don't get to decide and also i
don't get to decide
i don't think the aclu should
get to decide how much risk the united
states takes
for in terms of foreign adversaries
either you know where that belongs
commander in chief it's it's purely
it's purely a security issue so
that makes you wonder about them but
here's the real story i was getting to
the aclu
is also going after this small startup
called
clearviewai who does a an app
that if you have a photo of anybody
it'll find you more photos of that
person so you can figure out who they
are
so it's used by law enforcement to
identify
people and i guess the ice so the
federal government's
ice you know immigration guys are
they signed a contract with clearview to
use the app
to catch uh child traffickers
okay so here's the setup there's a
technology
which we know with complete certainty
because it's already already
being used already successful at exactly
this
so we don't have to speculate whether it
works
that's already determined that's why i
signed the contract
they're not guessing if it works they
know it works there are lots of examples
already of it working in other contexts
etc
so ice decides that this technology will
help them catch
child traffickers who would be on the
other side of that
right like who's on the other side
of using you know a standard technology
which will be widespread
far more than it is now to catch child
traffickers
well it turns out the aclu is so the
aclu
is trying to stop ice from using
a technology that we know catches
child traffickers just just wrap your
head around that
now the argument goes like this it's not
so much that they
care about this particular use they care
about the company
and that what it might be for you know
privacy
etc that's just a big
question for the country it doesn't
really have to do with this contract
and they're they're using there and
there's a punch line to this it gets
better
if you think this is crazy there's a
whole there's a whole good part coming
so make sure you hear that so
so here's the fun part um there's a i
guess an illinois law
recently passed that said it's illegal
to scrape
personal data like the somebody's
picture an identity or something
from other websites and then to use it
for some purpose
so so since illinois has this law that
gives the aclu
the ability to you know say that
clearview is a problem
now they're saying that clearview is a
problem in general and then they're
taking this ice thing
as the little fight they're going to
make which is the dumbest fight anybody
ever took
they're literally on the side of child
traffickers
and that's not even a joke they actually
literally
no kidding took the side of truck
of child traffickers i've never seen
anything like that it's
the most amazing thing you'll ever see
but anyway it gets better
here's the fun part
so uh google as you know
is one of the big funders of the aclu
and the aclu
is going after this company clearview
and the
the cause is that they're scraping this
personal information right so that's the
whole story
there's a story in the wall street
journal saying the same thing
scraping this personal information
except here's the punch line
they don't do that though the whole
basis of the story
is that clearview is scraping the photos
and
identification of people and they don't
do that that's not their business
what they do is they create an index of
stuff that's available on the internet
they just focus on faces that's it
clearview ai is a subset of
google function itself is not not a
subset of the company
but rather they do what google does
google
does not store on their own servers all
the information on the internet they
don't make a copy of it
they make an index somebody says you are
wrong
goodbye uh
so clearview makes an index of faces
and does not store any of that data
itself
rather restores the index information so
you can go find it
if you want to see it what does google
do
google does the same thing yeah google
does some caching but the
the main point is they're not storing a
copy of the whole internet
the uh so google's own business model
if you did a google image search
it would have an index to the images and
then it would show to you
that's exactly what clearview does they
just have an index
of where all the faces are and then it
just finds it for you
so google is funding the aclu
to sue clearview for the business model
that is identical to google's own
business model
and the only reason this is happening is
because apparently
the people doing the suing don't
understand how the technology works
they don't know the difference between
an index
and a copy and think about that
this whole thing it's it's like national
news and everybody's writing about it
and it's all based on the fact they
can't tell the difference
between an index which is perfectly
legal it's the way
it's the way basically google works all
search engines
are an index it's just another one
it's basically an extension of a
fingerprint database is just better
that's it you know if fingerprints were
legal
you know and they are to take
fingerprints this is just a better
version of it
using public information that's already
available and
if you did a little work you could find
it it'd just be harder without the app
so google actually found a way to sue
itself
not technically but they're basically
suing
through aclu that they fund
trying to stop a company that has the
same business model but here's the
kicker
they're a competitor so the aclu
the aclu
is managing to sue on behalf of google
if you count them as the funding source
somebody doing the same thing that
google's doing now
how is that going to go right
somebody says i blocked the wrong person
well the one i touched
said you were wrong so if i blocked the
wrong person
no i don't disagree with people for dis
i don't block people for disagreeing
with me
if you're new here the rule is this
you can disagree with me all you want
but you just have to show a reason it
could be a summary of a reason just oh i
think you didn't look at this data or
whatever
but if you just say you're wrong i block
you
because i don't need it anyway so keep
an eye on
this aclu story because it seems they've
turned bad now this is an example of a
gel man
amnesia i talk about this all the time
gail mann was the name of a physicist
who whenever he saw a story about
physics
he knew the story was wrong but then if
he saw a story about
some other topic he would say that's
probably right
knowing that every story he saw that he
knew the information about was wrong
now is it more likely that they're only
wrong about the things he knows about
no now this in this case
with the clear view ai i know
you know i know this much about
technology and i've looked into this
specific issue so i know that it's an
index so if you know just a little bit
about how things work
you can tell that all the headline
stories are just complete
because they think that they're scraping
and keeping the personal information
which isn't happening all right
i live in california which as you know
is a
third world country it wasn't always
this way
but last night i'm getting an alert on
my phone about which parts of california
are going to have to go without
electricity while the temperature
yesterday at my house was 106.
now my house is built to be very green
so
it could be 106 outside and my house
wouldn't get warmer than
probably 80 you know it would be livable
but
it's pretty rugged if you live in any
less insulated house um
that's a big deal so i live in i
actually live in a state
they can't figure out how to keep the
lights on all year
really now could you could you even
think
of any greater
indicator of incompetence than you can't
keep the lights on
in 2020 you can't keep the lights on all
year and
it's not even because there's a surprise
it's not like there was a disaster
it just got warm that's it
it got warm and my state is not
well run enough to keep the lights on
oh that's pretty bad you know it wasn't
long
ago that we didn't have enough water
so we don't have water electricity and
it looks like we're going to get rid of
police
and just fill the cities with
i don't know homeless and protesters or
whatever else
so i saw some stats that people are
leaving san francisco and new york city
in droves
but it's not everybody is it it's
basically all the people with money are
leaving
and i have to say that i've wondered for
some time
why cities can exist it just seems like
cities
should disappear now i say this as
someone who
you know through most of my career i
would have to go to new york city
you know once or twice a year for a book
publication
thing or a press tour or something like
that
and every time i go to new york city i'd
have the same feeling which is
you know there's a great energy here and
i do like you know the people are great
if you're in manhattan
uh of course i'm talking about before
any of the
protests happened it was great people
great energy
but the city's completely broken
i mean even even months ago i'd go there
and you know i'd get a like a high-end
hotel room where i pay a lot of money
and it's about the size of a shoebox
you just can't even wait to get out of
there so it
just is unlivable and then you try to
get some place
and you just can't get across town in
less than an hour it's it wasn't really
livable in my opinion
but apparently the people liked it i'm
not surprised
that san francisco and new york are
going to get emptied out
i also don't necessarily think it's the
end of the world
because the people leaving have options
they have enough money
and the people staying behind i don't
know were they shopping at those retail
stores anyway
who knows uh we're mixing
concepts here all right
so the new york post has a story about
the new york
pd the police department union endorsing
trump
now now you've got this you know super
democrat
uh city new york city and their police
department just endorsed
trump and i looked at the comments for
that article i tweeted about this
and the the people who were really
confused
they mis they got cause and effect
backwards
which was weird and they were writing
stuff like
well no wonder the police are not
trusted
if they're gonna back the president of
the united states
and i thought there's something wrong
with these people
and i kept seeing comments like that i
thought don't they have cause and effect
backwards
you know isn't it isn't it the
everything went wrong and people turned
against the police and that's why
they're backing trump i mean they didn't
back trump
first and then the city fell apart kind
of was the other way around
so i thought who could be so dumb that
they would
reverse cause and effect and i started
clicking on the profiles of the people
with those comments
writers writers artists
musicians it is so consistent
that the ones who really don't
understand anything that's going on
they're just always writers and i look
i'm looking for somebody who's
you know an economist or an engineer
none none there's nobody who
who understands how to you know compare
things properly
or to analyze things none of those
people are confused
about why the new york police department
might might want to back trump
to them that's not too surprising
but to the artists what's going on
uh bill barr was on hannity it might
have been last night
and he said this which made me happy
when asked
you're talking about racism systemic
racism and bill barr
attorney general says the racism is in
this country look no further than our
public education system that's a racist
system
he says maintained by the democratic
party and the teachers unions
keeping inner city kids in failing
schools
and i say to you how perfect is that
now i was saying before that the the
mark of the democrats
seems to be not knowing the difference
between what is
important and what is not it's very
consistent
now what is important and
if you're looking at the concept of
systemic racism what are the big
things well one thing that's not
important
is hoaxes and things that aren't true
and other things that is not important
if you were to rank all the problems of
black americans
the least important thing would be the
thing they're protesting about
the protesters are worrying about police
brutality now i'm not saying it doesn't
exist
even assuming it exists exactly as
is presented by the protesters which is
not so much the killing but maybe the
you know the more stopping and the more
more physicality that's certainly
something i would assume might be
happening i don't have data on that but
it feels like that probably does happen
and i think to myself if all of that's
true
it's still your smallest problem what's
the biggest problem
well bill barr just called it the
biggest problem
the alpha problem the base problem the
problem that makes all the other
problems
is that the school system is broken you
know if black americans were getting
good educations no matter where they
lived inner city or
other would you have as much poverty
would you have as much
crime would you have as much anything i
mean
it pretty much fixes fixes is too strong
word
it removes the friction
that um racism otherwise puts on the
system
so in other words if you're doing great
you're not as affected by racism even
though racism doesn't go away
as long as you're doing great doesn't
affect you
so if you fix education people have a
far
better chance of doing great and then
yeah there's still racism you can't make
it go away it's one of those things
that's like
air it's always going to be there but
you can make it not matter
so i think the administration might want
to hammer on this whole priority thing a
little bit more
because the the dems are getting this
wrong all the time the priority stuff
let me give you another example that
you turn on cnn and what are they
yammering about
the birther issue the birther issue
borne out of the fact that when the
president was asked about
kamala harris's uh you know legal
eligibility to be
vice president and the president said
well you know
there's an interesting theory about that
but i don't i don't really know
and that turned into cnn's biggest story
that is the smallest story in terms of
the priorities of anybody in this
country
that is the smallest story and it's not
even true
because the president is not pushing
birtherism
he's just saying i don't maybe which is
just enough to get people
yeah you know yapping about all the
wrong stuff
now it's becoming increasingly clear to
me
that one of the reasons that cnn might
want an msnbc
might want a black vice president for
biden
is so that they have reasons for
insulting president trump
doesn't it just make it easier it makes
it easier for
for them to criticize trump if they've
got at least one black person on the
ticket
right they want a black person they want
a woman
they got both so that they can claim
everything trump says is sexist
or racist it's kind of transparent
i mean it's just the ultimate situation
now compare that
to what the president's working on let's
say
for example peace in the middle east
yeah what is more important peace in the
middle east or
the thing he said he didn't know about
but turned into a story where he's
really promoting it
when all he said is he didn't know about
it uh
how about ending isis about the economy
how about decoupling from china
those are pretty big things and how
about
you know the question about the the post
office i guess everybody's treating that
that one seriously
but um look for this look for this
pattern that the
the democrats can't tell the difference
between a big problem and a small one
even when it's their own problems they
can't tell their own problems
the big ones from the small ones very
consistent
all right
there are three things that i think have
great potential
to help with the coronavirus situation
that doesn't mean for sure so
don't imagine you see any certainty in
what i say next i'm not a doctor
but there are three things that appear
to me just from reading and watching the
news
to have the most immediate short-term
potential one would be the blood
serum plasma situation where you're
taking the blood
antibodies from people who have already
recovered and sharing it with people who
need some extra protection the other is
these cheap
over-the-counter test strips that will
get
your viral load when it's at the high
point which is when you want to catch it
but won't get everything in the world
that could be caught
but they're so cheap that you could do
it every day and that would be enough to
basically just
halt the the virus and the third thing
would be hydroxychloroquine
which for whatever reason there's still
people on both sides
my current view is 30 chance that it
really works
based on just you know looking at the
various arguments back and forth
but that's still enough to give it a
give it a whirl in other words if your
doctor says it makes sense for you
if in fact i'm right and it's a 30
chance of my work that's totally a good
reason to
prescribe it but what
what do these three things have in
common the blood plasma thing the
over-the-counter test strips and the
hydroxide chloroquine
the three thing the thing they all have
in common is that they seem to be
under emphasized at least in this
country
it feels like the three most promising
things
are not really being pursued at the very
least
on the hydrox the chloroquine we should
be animals
about finding out if there's something
to it like we should be
chewing through a concrete wall to
either dismiss it as useless
or to confirm that it works now i don't
feel i see that energy happening
you know it's it's perfectly fine if the
government wants to say you know it's
not proven to the level that we'd want
in order to go hard at it
but who's making sure that that's true
you know who has studied every situation
bundled them together of the
hydroxychloroquine users versus all the
states and all the countries
that weren't using it and just see if
there's any difference
instead what we see is the you'll see
one country compared to three or four
others
completely useless because it would be
so easy to cherry pick any countries and
say look at this trend
these ones i cherry picked are doing
better than these other few eye cherry
book
out of 180 countries and the 50 states
you know all different experiences
completely useless
so if you think you've seen an argument
that is completely
persuasive that hydroxychloroquine works
i think you're wrong i think you're
wrong there's lots of indication that we
should find out if it works
i mean there's plenty of that but
there's no
strong indication in my opinion
this says it works but there's plenty of
suggestion that it might
the fact that we're not going hard at
those or explaining to the public
why we're not going as hard as we could
i mean why
why aren't we seeing some kind of blood
plasma donation thing
like every day you know why don't i walk
out
or drive my car into town and see a sign
that says
you know sign up here if you've had
coronavirus and you've recovered so
we'll get your blood
i mean i know it's happening but it
feels like it's the most
understated part of everything right
we're we've got hundreds of
vaccines being tested and and all this
other stuff but the things that we
almost could be sure would work
and then hydroxychloroquine we should
just make sure we know if it works
i feel they're a little underserved or
maybe it's just the communication of
them
so i would like one or the other either
communication that says we're doing
everything we can
or we've looked into it and we're not
going to do anything more because it
doesn't work
and here's the reason that would be fine
but it just feels they feel underserved
that's all i'm saying
is it too early to say that brain dead
biden has botched his campaign
is it too early to say it's botched
now if you've been following me for a
while you know why i'm saying botched
bosch is one of those great words and
you're seeing that the democrats are
using it to refer to the president's
coronavirus
response it's just an excellent
persuasion word
you know i didn't realize it until i
heard them use it and i thought wow
you don't really argue with botched
because it's so comprehensive it's like
wow i don't even need to give you the
details
details no it was botched it's just
it just makes the details not matter so
i thought i'd start using that about the
biden
campaign because it does seem to fit i
mean you could argue that the whole
campaign has been botched even though
he's ahead
um so yesterday
harris and biden did their little it
looks like they've got some kind of a
set
that looks like sort of a war room with
flags on the wall
and maps of the united states and it
looks
sort of like a newsroom but maybe like a
war room kind of cool thing
and my take on it is
good try but i think they missed it felt
like a mess
their little artificial set looked
um pathetic
because it didn't look high-end enough
so you'd say to yourself well it's like
they're
broadcasting from the oval office or it
looks like they're broadcasting from
some
important place it just looked like you
had a little set
designer and you you put your little you
know
douchey desks in there ah
it didn't quite work i i know what they
were going for and so what they were
going for made sense
to to give it a more i don't know
powerful
or serious look that made sense
but they didn't quite hit the mark to me
it looked looked a little
uh amateurish i guess botched i think
you could say it was botched
anyway here was the interesting thing
the if you're
looking at it from the audience's
perspective they had kamala harris in a
desk
of the left and they had biden on the
desk on the right
let me ask you this if you were the one
in charge of designing
where each of them sat would you have
put the
top of the ticket on the left or would
you have put the top of the ticket
on the right i would have put the top of
the ticket on the left
because the left is the important part
of the position in western culture
so in the west we we read from left to
right
i've told you before that if you look at
a website the important news or the news
that they want you to think is important
is in the top left
same as reading you you know our brains
are just wired at least in the west
to look at the top of the left or at
least the left
and start there and go to the right so
we're compiling a number of uh let's say
subjective looking
anecdotal situations that all suggest
the same thing you know when you see a
photograph of
uh kamala harris with a big picture and
then there's a tiny little biden behind
her
to just to indicate that he's part of it
too it's all
collectively coming together like the
public is supposed to see
kamala harris as the top of the ticket
you know they don't want to say
it out loud but you're going to see it
in photography
and positioning and in in a hundred
different ways
and then they didn't take questions if
they do take
questions i would like to suggest
something for the
any reporter who can get harris to sit
down and take questions
it goes like this you've probably all
seen the video
of uh so kamalaris was giving a talk
somewhere
couldn't have been too too long ago i
think it was before she was running for
president
but not too long ago in which she said
that
um young people i think between the ages
of 18 and 24 she was talking about
she said that they're stupid now is she
wrong
no no no she's not wrong
she's completely right because i've said
exactly the same thing
it isn't really even an insult to say
that young people are stupid
because i was young i'm talking about
myself
scott young stupid
compared to you know more experienced
scott likewise and this is meant as no
insult to
my dear beloved viewers but you were all
stupid
you were all stupid between the ages of
18 and 24.
there's no way around that right but now
you're wiser
you're experienced you're mature but you
were stupid then
i was stupid kamala harris was stupid
president trump was stupid
we were all stupid when we're that
certain age while thinking
we were smart but here's the thing if
somebody gets
harris to answer some questions here are
the questions i would like her to
answer kabul harris you once said that
people
young people are stupid does that extend
to greta tunberg
isn't that a great question would you
say that greta tunberg
is is is stupid because she's in that
age group
and one follow-up question after that is
do you think that the stupidity just
stops at 24
or would you say kamala i'm just asking
for your opinion
would you say that somebody like
aoc who's on the the younger side of the
political
professional spectrum would you say that
at the age
25 on her 25th birthday she became smart
or do you think there's a little bit of
that stupid stuff
from age 18 to 24. does it linger a
little bit
or would you say aoc is out of that
stupid zone yet
completely i'm we're just trying to
understand how the stupidity works
according to your world view
those would be hard questions to answer
wouldn't they
somebody says awkward to your wife
um see now i don't block you for that
because you gave your reasons
as long as you give your reasons you're
okay so it turns out that bahrain
joined egypt and oman and backing the
uae's deal with israel so
the president and i think jared kushner
had teased
that there might be more good news
coming in the middle east
maybe this is the beginning of it so
bahrain and um and oman
and egypt and the uae are all
leaning in israel's direction now would
we be surprised at this
no because the president
and jared kushner have set up this
situation
where if you imagine there were two
major powers
in the middle east and throwing russia
as a complicator
but if if there was the iranian sphere
of influence
and there was let's say the saudi israel
the united states
sphere of influence because they're sort
of on the same team
ish it didn't make sense to be in the
iranian sphere of influence anymore did
it
because it's a losing sphere nobody
wants to be on the losing team and it's
pretty obvious that iran
is not heading toward a good place
so i think that the president degraded
iran to the point
where it was just smart to be on the
winning team it's like you might as well
just be in the winning team why don't we
just make peace
act like you know civilized people
and the palestinians apparently did not
like what the
uae was doing and so they decided to
withdraw their diplomat and close and
closer
i don't know if they closed the embassy
but i'm thinking to myself
does the uae really care that they lost
the palestinian
embassy or ambassador i don't think they
care at all
do they so
anyway that's good um
you know there's there's this little
side story about
uh jeff zucker the head of cnn and how
he's been a kamala harris supporter for
for a long time and you have to ask
yourself
how important was it in terms of kabul
harris getting the
vp spot how important was it
that cnn was going to back her i mean
i'm sure they would have backed whoever
the
nominee picked but don't you wonder if
cnn was really the one who
was the main force behind picking kamala
harris
you know the the cnn clinton
universe yeah i don't think anything
happens the way you think it does
i feel like the real story behind all of
this is never quite the one that you
hear
all right what else we got going on here
i think those they had
those the big things just make sure i
didn't miss anything
no i did not i have been very thorough
um arms embargo who's got an arms
embargo
i just see that in the uh
middle east is a power keg you think
well that's no different than ever
right um
representative tulane didn't like it
what a surprise
somebody says brett bear is anti-trump
that is not true he is neither pro
nor anti-trump you know brett bear is
like the one guy
who you'd have to say all right he's
playing it right down the middle
he's trying to he's trying to tell the
actual news
um
what about jeff bezos uh
are you saying that he's behind some of
this i don't know
i don't know that exactly all right
well let us continue watching what
happens with the
plotters who were behind the russia
collusion hoax
see how many of them go to jail uh
the milly weaver story i'm a little
confused by that one we don't know quite
what's going on there so i'll just watch
that one a little bit
yeah i'll be on the greg gutfeld show
tonight check your
local listings and
and thank you all right that's all for
now and i will talk to you
later
