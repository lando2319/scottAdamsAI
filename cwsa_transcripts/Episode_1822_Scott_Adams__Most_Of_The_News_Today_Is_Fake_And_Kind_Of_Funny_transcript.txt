well once again let me inform you I do
not have monkey pox
but if you want to know what a bad look
bad luck looks like bad luck looks like
injuring your lip
uh during the monkey pox
I know it looks like I put my lip in the
wrong place doesn't it but no no just a
burn
all right
you seem like you're in Texas somebody
says huh
good morning everybody
how would you like to enjoy today's show
more than any show you've ever enjoyed
I know pretty good stuff coming and all
you need is a cup of under a glass of
canteen jungle or glass once
hold on canteen jug or
flask
I'm gonna get this right I'm trying to
remember my own stuff
and all you need
all you need is a copper marker a glass
of canteen Dragon flask you can't take
your Chelsea Stein a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous and it happens
now
go
I apologize for my dainty cup
this is no way to drink coffee
no coffee does not go in a dainty cup
unless you're visiting the queen
and even then you should be drinking tea
so there's no there's no right time for
a little teacup
well
um I have a question about the Democrat
strategy I feel as if
the strategy is not to remove uh Biden
from office for incompetence but rather
to make him slowly disappear
I feel like that's the the uh the
strategy for example
first first he got covered and then he
had to quarantine so that was good but
then he got out
and then they said we're going to have
to give him covet again so it gets
covered back to back
but what I'm expecting is somewhere
around the end of this next quarantine
period
I think we're going to hear that he has
something called serial covet serial
code it just keeps coming back
and he's probably got a comorbidity of
TDS
so if you had the comorbidity of TDS to
the serial repeating covid well Joe
Biden is just going to have to hide his
basement forever
now I'm not sure about this next part
but does it seem to you he's getting
thinner
as anybody knows he seems to be getting
thinner he was always he was always
quite fit but he seems to be I think
they're feeding him less
yeah I think they're slowly trying to
make him disappear like they'll feed him
a little less and he'll just get a
little smaller and one day you'll you'll
see a video of him in his basement
he'll be like 85 pounds
and you know it's not until you get down
to like 65 pounds so that you can you
know say he's actually gone but I think
that I think the cat is on the roof
they're they're slowly trying to
disappear him you know first these
public Persona and then they'll shrink
him with lack of food until he's a
little ball about this big and they'll
have you know just keep them alive with
tubes and stuff I feel like that's the
strategy I don't know I'm just guessing
well what do you think would happen in a
hypothetical matchup for president
between Biden and Trump if it were to
happen today
what do you think of erasmussen poll
showed let's see if you're smart
who do you think would win
as of today
well according to Rasmussen uh if the
election were held today 40 percent of
likely voters would vote for Biden and
46 would vote for Trump
but another 10 percent would choose some
other candidate if it were just those
two and somebody else 10 for another
campaign
so what do you think of uh Yang's new
political party
who is he going to take votes away from
yeah I think I heard somebody say
he would take votes away from
Republicans but it was the Republicans
who were going to vote for a Democrat
anyway
I don't know maybe
Yang will yank votes
uh yeah I don't it's hard to see how
it's helpful but maybe
you know if Yang can control 10 of the
vote
he's a king maker right so it's not a
bad strategy if you know you've got all
these sort of in-between confused people
what if let's just do a what-if
what if
Yang's real play is to only try to
control the sensible people
because there aren't that many of them
I'd say about 10 maybe if 10 percent of
the country
are identified with a political party
but they're willing to listen to a
better argument
it's about 10 percent
he could control the whole country like
Joe manchin so everybody who says this
Yang thing is just you know a sideshow
and no importance is not a sideshow it's
an insurrection
legally but it's an Insurrection in
Concept in the sense that if he succeeds
he will be effectively the president
just by having a third party that
actually makes sense and here's
something that I think Andrew Yang could
do
that so far nobody else was able to do
be reasonable
nobody tried that yet all right nobody
really tried being reasonable yet
there have been third party attempts but
they always seemed you know sort of uh
ideologically driven
so what would happen
if you had a third party where the only
thing they're trying to do is figure out
what makes sense
you know follow the science what if you
had all right how about this what if you
had to follow the science party
you know I guess the Democrats think
they are that but evidence suggests
maybe not so much
I don't know there's so I think if you
ignore this Yang situation you do it at
your peril because if he gets just 10 of
people on board and it's the reasonable
people who could switch sides in a in a
situation
that's that's real power
that's real power Define science yeah
good question
well how would you like a story about
how I'm so right
that's your favorite story isn't it
no your favorite story is when I'm wrong
and I admit it I know I know I know how
you are you'd rather me be wrong but I'm
sorry I'm as right as right can be
because it turns out that there's new
Harvard University study
and they tried to look into the
motivations of the uh capital rioters
now they used an interesting term here
rioters
so I don't know if that excludes people
that they thought were just protested so
it's I have a little question about what
they how they Define that but they found
out that only eight percent of the
people who they called rioters
uh believed they were there for an
Insurrection and 92 percent of them
believed they were there to save
the democracy
it saved the Republic
now is there anybody you know
who said hey I think that j6 committee
is making us think past the sale
the sale is what did the people who were
at the event believe
because they started with they wanted
Insurrection and then let's look at all
the facts no you don't start with they
want an insurrection
that you have to demonstrate that and
when the When anybody did well I guess
this is probably the first one I don't
think there's been another
correct me if I'm wrong but I don't
think there's been another study and
certainly not from Harvard University
which at least the left would be
inclined to believe
this says that basically 92 percent of
their people believed Trump
that there were some sketchiness to the
election and that they were there to fix
the sketchiness they were not there to
overthrow the government they're there
to fix it
now what does the January 6 committee
and all of the mainstream news do with
the fact that the very Foundation the
most important part of their narrative
has collapsed and it was destroyed by
their own side
if you call anything coming out of
Harvard left leaning and I think you
could make that assumption now even the
person involved in the study said uh he
was quite surprised
he was surprised
and uh the results were that quote many
believe they were defending democracy
from quote imminent existential danger
unquote unquote
right
um
how does the news handle this
the only way the mainstream news can
handle this new information is by
completely disappearing it
it will be disappeared right in front of
you
do you think there's any way that if
Harvard study if Harvard University did
a study and it came out showing that 92
percent of the attendees wanted a
literal Insurrection to to install a
dictator
suppose it had gone that way
do you think the news would cover it
I think so
yeah I think they might I think they
might cover it if the people said they
were there for an instruction but what
if the people say that they were not
there for an Insurrection they were
there to fix the Republic exactly what
it looked like
to me I mean that's exactly what it
looked like to me is there anybody who
even doubted that who's watching this
is there anybody here who didn't have
the same impression that they were there
for good intentions even if they had bad
information we don't know if they had
bad information but if they did
right
so this is fascinating the the degree to
which the fake news no longer needs to
pretend
it's sort of stubbing isn't it
are you surprised that the fake news
doesn't need to pretend anymore they're
really not trying to hide this
is not hidden at all well it's hidden in
the sense that you'd have to go to
Breitbart in this case so I found out
about the Harvard study by looking at uh
Joel Pollock's article in Breitbart
and Jonathan turley's been on this point
as well now let me ask you this
who in the country
of let's say a political public figure
what political public figure has been
telling you
and I haven't heard I haven't heard one
other person say it of political you
know let's say public figures
what other public figure told you that
they were thinking past the sale and
that the most important question is is
this what were they thinking when they
did it it was only me
right I'm not wrong am I I
I believe it was only me in the whole
 world I think it was only me
that's why you watch me
all right
um and then I've got a second question
about the eight percent who did think
they were there for an insurrection
do you think that if you really drilled
down with the eight percent that you
would find out that they really wanted
an insurrection
maybe yeah I know some of you saying the
eight percent are feds that's funny
um there might be some feds in that who
knows I doubt that's who got uh
interviewed but
for the pole
but what do you think they wanted do you
think that if you had asked them they
would said well our end goal is to
destroy the country
some might yeah they might be anarchists
do you think they would have said their
end goal is to install Trump as an
actual dictator
I doubt it
I doubt it because he wouldn't want the
job I mean
I've not seen no indication that he
would want to be the dictator I mean in
the sense that it's impractical
if it were practical maybe that's
another conversation but given this so
obviously impractical
who did they think was going to be the
dictator
or were they going to overthrow it for
some other form of democracy see if you
drill down on the insurrectionist I
think you would find out that they're
either literally crazy
or what they wanted was a little bit
closer to fixing the Republic after all
it's just they had a different view of
what that looks like
I feel like the insurrectionists were
probably closer to the regular people
than we think they just like to use more
Hyperbole and you know maybe they're in
militias and they just talk that way
right
and and the other thing that I've been
saying forever that the Democrats don't
seem to recognize is that there's a way
that Republicans talk about overthrowing
their government
that is first of all very healthy
because we're always yeah Republicans
are always on the verge of don't push us
don't push us that's a health that's a
healthy tension
but it's never that serious in my
opinion they're not really that serious
about overthrowing the government
they're just making it clear that
there's a line
don't cross that line
all right here's my next fake news story
from Newsweek
I'm not sure if this is yeah I'll call
it fake news it's in the category of
fake news so here's the title of the
story tell me what you think the story
would be about if you saw this headline
in Newsweek
fentanyl surge is started and peaked
under Trump
despite the GOP blaming Biden wow the
fentanyl surge
started under and peaked it was the
highest under Trump wow
so what do you think that story says do
you think the story says is if you're
coming in late is a burn I burned myself
on twice heated soup and a piece of
spinach that wouldn't leave my lip it
was quite painful
but no it's not monkey box or anything
else
um
sorry for that diversion so the Newsweek
story about fentanyl surge under Trump
when you dig down into the story it says
that Trump is seized more fentanyl
coming across the border than Biden did
just just let that sink in
just let it
let that sink in this is Newsweek
it's Newsweek right they they are a
discredited organization I give you that
but not everybody knows it you know if
you're 75 and you grew up reading
Newsweek and you see a Newsweek headline
do you think that Newsweek is a
discredited news organization
maybe you don't know that I mean those
of us who are a little more you know
sophisticated in our knowledge we know
that but not everybody knows that
so I think that when they see a fentanyl
surge they're going to think it's a
surge in overdose deaths don't you
but in fact the overdose death rate is
the highest under Biden so not only did
Trump do a stronger job of seizing
fentanyl at the border according to
Newsweek
but there were also more overdose deaths
under Biden both of the facts in the
story are pro-trump
and they made them look like they were
negative
and and this is right in front of you
because the title simply just doesn't
match the content and they'll do this
over and over again title doesn't match
the content title doesn't match the
content
all right here's another fake news and
of CNN so
um I love learning who the uh opinion
hit peace people are
so there's this guy Dean obadyla I might
be pronouncing wrong not intentionally
um who does opinion pieces for CNN and
he's often a trump
attack dog you know he'll just attack
Trump for anything and Republicans
and CNN and all the fake news uh had a
little trouble yesterday because their
fake news was that the GOP doesn't like
veterans and vetoed uh or didn't vote
for a bill to protect them and their
health from the so-called burn pits
danger and of course uh because Jon
Stewart
was saying that the GOP voted against
something that they had recently voted
for it looked like it was all political
and they were painting the GOP as a
bunch of political pastors who didn't
really care about veterans
what do you think the real story was
the real story of course was that the
Democrats put a whole bunch of pork like
400 billion or some gigantic number I
don't know what it was some big number
of pork in the bill and the Republicans
said I don't care how good the bill is
you can't do that yeah it was a poison
pill
so do you think that Dean Obadiah
who is there I would say he's among
their lowest level attack dogs and by
lowest level I mean I feel like
I feel like he gets the assignment that
you can't win unless you just lie like
you can't make your case unless you're
willing to stretch or lie or omit you
know leave out context is the only way
you can get it done so apparently there
are some people who do opinion pieces
for CNN who are consistently willing to
let's say
test the test the outer battery
boundaries of fake news
but uh Dean completely leaves out the
context that's the only context that
matters which is the Republicans didn't
like all the pork in the bill am I to be
a fact Jack I'm right about that right
am I correct the only thing the
Republicans didn't like was the extra
stuff that got added on
as a dirty trick basically
so if you don't mention that
you have so little respect for your
readers so little respect
it was uh and in fact Dean Obadiah
characterized the gop's action as quote
the GOP is trying to score political
points by delaying this vital piece of
legislation
is that what they're doing they're
trying to score political points by
making themselves look bad
but stopping pork
it looks like it's exactly the opposite
of that what this looks like is that
politicians put their own benefit uh
lower than the countries
now it's hard to on it's hard to imagine
anybody would do that so I'm not sure
that we could read their minds and
conclude that they were just operating
out of principle
but it looks like it
it looks like it again I can't read
their minds but if you're a Republican
would you want to turn down something
that was a veteran Health Bill a
Republican
what Republican thinks is good to vote
against a veteran
Health bill
even if there's a reason that's
technical has to do with the pork that
never looks good that never looks good
but a lot of Republicans did it
apparently or or are going to do it or
whatever
uh I did it
so are we map it are we mad at
Republicans for standing on principle
against their own self-interest
because that's kind of looks like what
happened I feel that they were not
exactly pursuing their own self-interest
good because here's what here's what
would look good for the politician
I voted for that bill
because I like veterans by the time you
got you know campaigning for re-election
you could just say that and people would
believe it I'm one of the few
Republicans who voted for helping
veterans nobody's going to look into
that pork part of the problem
okay
yeah go read the bill somebody says
so I floated the idea that every bill
should have
um
a list of ingredients so you can see
what's in the bill good and bad like the
bad might be might raise taxes on some
people
the good might you the I don't know
somebody to score that the OMB or
something but the good would be here are
the things we want to accomplish
and then here's the price
the price is this might cost more this
might cause inflation this might raise
that
just just list the ingredients the good
stuff and the bad stuff
and then somebody else uh mentioned that
there should be a requirement for a
one-page executive summary
I like it a requirement for a one-page
executive summary now you might need you
know
a paragraph or two for each part of the
bill and there might be lots of them so
you know maybe really it's more like a
paragraph for each component or
something like that but it needs to be
readable by the public and I would say
that if the public if the average voter
can't understand the bill
then it should not be voted out
in fact I'd love to see each bill be
scored for let's say clarity
scored for clarity give some independent
group to say all right we
we talked about this bill with let's say
a group of volunteers and they they
couldn't understand it so we score this
you cannot vote on this
I I think the Congress should be
prevented from voting on anything the
public doesn't understand
you're by a majority anyway
what do you think the the Congress
wouldn't be allowed to vote for anything
the public doesn't understand
yeah if you're joining if you're joining
late I'll just tell everybody this is a
burn on my lip if you think it's more
something more exciting I kind of wish
it were but it's just a burn
um a score for readability
would be something that AI could do
there you go
artificial intelligence could write a
summary of every bill
how about that how about that this is
pretty good ideas
all right um
here's a provocative idea that I don't
think that I'm quite in favor of
what I want to share with you
it comes from a doctor all right so this
is not for me this is from a doctor
uh on on Twitter he goes by doc Anarchy
he's got a sub stack you might be
interested in as well has lots of
interesting and uh provocative ideas
that are not quite the normal the normal
point of view that you see so it's worth
seeing it even if you disagree with them
I love seeing an actual medical doctor
who's thinking through things critically
so that alone
that alone is worth doing right so if
you want somebody to follow that you're
not following follow uh at Dr Anarchist
for interesting points of view not not
ones you're all going to agree with
right so it's not about agreeing they're
just interesting points of view
all right here it is his interesting
points of view nobody overdoses on
prescription opioids I don't know if
that's true completely this sounds like
a little bit of an over claim but he's a
doctor
um so let's say it might be hyperbole
but don't get too caught up on whether
that's 100 True let's say it's 95 true
it probably is it's probably closer to
95 true but but we'll we'll allow a
little hyperbole okay and then he goes
on eliminate the black market for
opioids and you'll eliminate 99 of
overdoses
now remember he's a doctor
he's a doctor
so at least anecdotally and probably
he's looked at the studies too that it's
hard to overdose on a prescription Med
because you would know what the overdose
amount would be
now don't be before before you question
him you should do your research
because the addicts themselves will tell
you that the real danger is the fake
stuff
now again I'm operating purely
anecdotally right here right
but my own stepson
told me in direct language that he
wouldn't take counterfeit pills because
they probably have fentanyl in them and
you can't know what you're getting
and then he died of a overdose so he
probably did exactly what he said he
wouldn't do the week before which is why
I questioned whether this would work but
anyway let's get to that
um
so if you eliminated the black market
for opioids you wouldn't get the fake
stuff
um if you could give legal
well-known entities to the addicts would
they take these legal well-known things
and not have overdose deaths
now some of you are going to say
um
yeah we're talking about unintentional
overdoses we're not talking about
suicide
um
so
can you compare this to the San
Francisco outdoor drug thing that looked
like a huge failure and Michael
schellenberger talks about that a lot
do you think what he's talking about is
similar to this outdoor free drug
clinics
no no he didn't say that you're
conflating two stories that's the
problem here you're conflating the
homeless problem which he's not even
talking about that's not his topic
giving free drugs to homeless people
doesn't make them be less homeless
so if you're trying to clean up San
Francisco which is you know all the
homeless people walking around and
taking over the city giving them free
drugs is not going to make them
leave the streets or go away or anything
so it doesn't do anything about homeless
but what I don't know is if it reduced
the number of uh
overdoses
I haven't heard one way or the other so
I don't know but what uh doc doc Anarchy
is talking about is really just a narrow
point
that if the only kind of opioid that was
available and let's say there was some
way to make that happen if the only kind
of available was high quality control
that that alone would eliminate 99 of
Overdose deaths what do you think
now
let me be uh
coldly analytical here
what would happen if you stopped a
hundred thousand addicts per year from
dying
all right now this is going to come back
to me so don't don't think out do not
think I'm exempting myself from the
following point I'm not I'm in this
point
if you let a hundred thousand addicts
live every year are you better off
now I obviously would like my stepson to
still be alive
but are you better off
I hate to say it but you're not better
off
I might have been better off because I
love him right so I loved him so I might
be better off because I would prefer it
but would you be better off with my
stepson back in society not even close
sorry
sorry if you want to be honest you would
not be better off with him in society he
was not adding he was just purely
subtracting sorry people loved him I
mean he was very he was popular and
lovable and stuff but he wasn't going to
help
so you have to ask yourself if even if
you could get what you wanted do you
really want it
because
that's a fair question
it's a fair question now I do think that
some kind of ethical moral consideration
suggests that keeping them alive would
be the better alternative I mean that
would be a reasonable point of view but
you can't you can't ignore the fact that
keeping alive a hundred thousand uh
Liars
has some impact because remember all
addicts are liars you know that right
if you see somebody who's lying about
everything
the first question you should ask
yourself is what drugs are they on
because often people who are lying about
everything are recovering a drug a drug
pattern
so always look for that sometimes lying
about everything means you're a
narcissist and sometimes it means you
have a drug problem and sometimes it
means you're both
um I made the point that insurance
predicts all
this is a point I've made a number of
times that every time we're arguing in
the political realm about what is or
what isn't what's true what isn't that
you can ignore all of that because
that's all political and just look what
the insurance companies do
because the insurance companies don't
have the option of being political
they just have to look at the numbers
and say well we've got a set of premiums
based on this level of death
um you know and we have to adjust it
based on you know what changes right so
the the insurance company is just coldly
looking at data and the other thing that
the insurance companies have
that you don't have is their internal
data
so an insurance company in 2022 can tell
you the following
it can tell you which zip codes had the
most vaccinations the highest
vaccination rates
and it can tell you where there was the
biggest change in death rates
now what the insurance industry is
telling you is that where there were
high levels of vaccinations the death
rate did not go up nearly as much as
where there was a low level of
vaccination
maybe there's some other factors
involved but their data is very clear
that vaccinations saved lives and so
they're going to base base their
premiums on that so if you're in a zip
code where people are dying because
they're unvaccidated maybe you pay more
for insurance
now where do you find the data
they have their own data that's the key
if you say to yourself why did the
insurance companies believe that show me
the data
they're not going to do that because
it's internal data it's their own
customers who are dying right they're
literally looking at their own customer
base and they're saying the ones in this
ZIP code are suddenly dying the ones
that this ZIP code are also suddenly
dying but at a smaller rate
now a number of people said to me Scott
Scott
what you don't realize is that insurance
companies are lying just like all
companies and what they're doing is
they're trying to be woke
by telling you that vaccinations work is
really just wokeness
so they're they're not using data to
make decisions they're not trying to
make money
they're trying to be woke because that's
more important than profits
do you know who says that sort of thing
do you know who says that an insurance
company favors wokeness over profits
what kind of person says that
yeah what what characterized somebody
who would say
that they might prefer wokeness over
Prophets
you're saying idiots but that's unkind
I'm gonna I'm gonna give the kindest
interpretation it's people with no
experience in business whatsoever
all right you don't have to say NPC
you're stupid just say this people with
no experience in business whatsoever I
don't believe there are any experienced
business people
who would say that an insurance company
is going to put itself out of business
to serve wokeness
um I don't think so
now people said to me Buzz Scott but
Scott
Disney did exactly that they made a bad
decision for walkness and hurt their
profitability so what about that
to which I say that's not what I'm
talking about that's a completely
different situation
yes companies will make public PR
statements
that that are for wokeness
but that doesn't mean they're
intentionally destroying their the
engine of their economic survival if an
insurance company starts pricing things
incorrectly
they go into business
they have to price correctly based on
their data or they can't stay in
business
that is completely different staying in
business versus saying some things in
public you think will sound good but you
hope it won't hurt you too much
Disney made a gigantic mistake
but they didn't do it intentionally
they did not intentionally destroy their
business or degrade it by doing
something that like that I don't think
they quite saw that DeSantis pushback
coming
so to imagine that it's similar that
somebody accidentally hurts their
business by saying thing they they think
wouldn't hurt but it did that's
completely different from an insurance
company saying look we'd better make
ourselves super unprofitable
or else we won't look woke enough
that's not happening
that's not happening anywhere ever
ever no insurance company behind the
scenes is going to tell you well behind
the scenes they're going to make money
they wouldn't be talking out loud to
help themselves in this case
do you think
yeah I feel it would just hurt them if
you knew what they were doing they're
just trying to make money
period all right
there is something called and I don't
know too much about it some kind of uh
the Q Park q-p-a-r-q
framework for uh having rational
discussions without all the crazy stuff
that happens
uh they saw Brett Weinstein talking
about it and I think he invited Sam
Harris to be part of it and the idea is
there's this useful framework
for debating and if you use the
framework and I think there's some
software that helps you work through it
or something I don't know all the
details but the idea is that you could
use some third-party format
to keep two people on a sane and
reasonable uh debate
what do you think of that suppose the
technology works so let's take an
assumption I don't know that that's true
but let's say that technology Works will
this change everything
because now you'd have a way to for
people in the debate getting rid of all
the crazy parts so you could actually
see the debate
no it won't do you know what's wrong
with this problem
it it solves the non-existing problem
because the reason that people uh
the people say crazy things during
debates is that they don't want to say
the real thing the real thing doesn't
help them
the reason people lie is that the truth
doesn't give them power or entertainment
people want to watch the news to or
interpret the news or get their
preferred interpretation through the
news they want to win debates because
they want Power
and we watch them because we want
entertainment
as soon as you imagine the people's main
motivation is to guess something right
you're completely lost
nobody's main motivation is to get the
right answer
the main motivation is to be right and
to get power now people think that if
they had power they would do the right
things in some way that's the right
thing too but nobody cares about the
logic of a debate
so you're solving a problem that isn't a
problem because debates are
intentionally
if anybody wanted to act wanted to
debate in a reasonable way they don't
they already know how to do it
you know do you think that Brett
Weinstein and Sam Harris don't have the
intellectual tools
to have a rational a rational uh
discussion of course they do of course
they do but would they do it
I know those those might be two of the
most famously rational people in our in
the public discussions
and I don't even think they could do it
and I have very high opinion of both of
them in terms of their intellectual
academic credentials right I just don't
know it's something people can do
I I because you know I had I had a
conversation with Sam Harris and it was
not my opinion that logic was guiding
his his uh opinion
some of you saw it too right did you
have a sense that he preferred
um logic
I I didn't I didn't get the sense that
it was even a preference
it felt like a strong preference to
avoid uh being rational about Trump
that's how it felt now again I can't
read his mind I don't know what Sam
Harris is thinking privately about
anything so it's just it's just a
reaction
you know basically a reaction on my end
it's not about him
all right
so
um I love the fact that somebody's
working on that trying to get our our
conversations uh realistic but I think
AI is going to solve this problem for us
and here's how I think AI is going to
take any story and add the context that
is missing
and it's going to rewrite it in simpler
terms and make the misleading headlines
go away
it should not be hard for AI to
dismantle fake news and and tell you
what was fake about it just like I did
basically so what I did was I I said hey
this title doesn't match or it's
misleading
compared to the content I think hey I
could do that most of the time
and I think they could summarize better
and I think they could basically solve
fake news I mean they could come close
foreign
is Google the top AI I actually don't
know that
and I believe I uh credited the wrong
person was saying that AI was conscious
so I saw a follow-up
uh
I saw a follow-up saying that I may have
accredited the top Google researcher for
saying that AI was conscious but at
least somebody who knows what they're
talking about thinks I was crediting the
wrong person because I think the actual
Google head does not say that
so some somebody who's
somebody's high up in that world did say
it
um
all right he was considered one of the
four horsemen of atheism yet
uh Cody the life maker all right just
looking at your
your comments well that's all I had to
do to talk about today I noticed Greg
Gutfeld was
um trending today
his his show has continued to be
gigantically popular
it was weird that weirdo hired a lawyer
for the AI
I don't know that story
um oh let's talk about uh Pelosi going
to Taiwan
I don't know is that really a story
I think it would be a story if Pelosi
didn't go to Taiwan if you know she had
wanted to and changed her mind or
something but
um
I feel as though
it's sort of a nothing
yeah it's absolutely a story because
we'll talk about it but what do you
think China's going to do do you think
China is going to punish the United
States in some way for an American
citizen uh who is a free citizen going
to another free country to visit you
think they're going to punish us for
that
I hope so
[Laughter]
I hope so
boy do I hope China tries to punish us
for Pelosi visiting Taiwan yeah I hope
so
because it yeah we definitely need to be
murdering their uh fentanyl dealers uh
in China so if there if there's
something they're doing to us let let's
let's uh ratchet it up on our side too
let's let's go kill their fentanyl
dealers where they stand
um did you see that there's a
um I tweeted this but I forgot to put it
in my notes
there's a
candidate for Arizona attorney general
let me find his name so I can give him a
little shout out here
uh probably didn't write it down
damn me for not writing that down
somebody somebody will give me the name
here in the comments
but there's a candidate for attorney
general in
um
in Arizona
who says we should uh at least that
Arizona should treat the or label the
cartels as terrorist organizations
so the if the federal government will
not label
uh the cartels as terrorist
organizations Arizona might do it if
they elect this attorney general and if
he gets his way
and apparently there's some
constitutional allowance I'd never heard
this before but if you heard this states
can create their own National I guess
State guard not a National Guard
have you heard the states can form their
own armies basically
apparently that's a thing yeah so the
Arizona uh potential AG guy running as a
republican
um will somebody give me his name
he deserves a shout out
just Google that for me and give me a
shout out in the comments because I
don't want to not mention his name he's
too strong Evergreen no Hamida hamide
so his last name is
h-a-m-a-d-e-e-h hamide
so he's Republican
and uh Abe hamide okay he is Republican
and he's uh tough on the cartels and
um I like him
I like him
I like him for that I don't know what
else he does oh Garfield's still
trending
let's see why
there's a July 25th Glenn Greenwald
tweet about the Gutfeld show how it's
basically mopping up the competition
now
uh
so it's fun to it's fun to watch him
succeed I hope you I hope you're
enjoying it as much as I do
um
all right
uh here's uh
huh
all right here's a uh a little
information on Fentanyl and the Dr
Anarchy comment
um I don't want to attribute this yet
but let's just say it's from another
doctor and uh doc Anarchy I've been a
reader to myself before I read it out
loud uh
um oh okay so it's hard to overdose on
uh oral opiates
so I think that's what doc Anarchy was
saying it's hard to it's sort of rare
to overdose on prescription pills
but if you mix it
if you have a second medication called
uh
benzodiazepine it becomes very easy oh
and ninety percent of prescription
opiate overdoses include that drug
benzodiazepine
oh wow
so uh that's a special case but I don't
think that um
I don't think that takes away from Doc
Anarchy's point
because you know the people who are not
uh taking this other drug at the same
time would get a lot of benefit
all right so this is good uh good
context
all right
um
all right and that
um
that
is what I had to talk about today
yeah Carrie lake is tough on the cartels
as well also running what is she running
for governor of Arizona
yes it is a great show it is a great
show
you know the the larger point is that
I'm right about everything
today
all right
how did I determine that the Democrats
put a poison bill in the pack to bill
um
look we'll Google it and you should find
that the bill includes uh things that
are off point
and that the Republicans
um cared about that
I feel like there was a story I skipped
here that I really wanted to do
let's check
um
yeah
did you affect the DeSantis ESG move I
did not I mean I don't think I did
uh
okay
uh what's my prediction for China's
response
I don't know I I think it's going to be
symbolic
um I don't think China's response will
affect you as a citizen of the United
States I feel like they might do
something like move some warships around
or you know uh
talk differently I don't know I just
don't think it's going to be anything
they have to push back
uh the famine coming I'm going to vote
against the famine
based on the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters now I know this one's special
because you can't grow food very quickly
so if the food you grew doesn't produce
that's not really a quick turnaround fix
I get that
but I'm going to vote against Mass
famine
now I don't know that I'm right so I'm
not going to put 100 on this one yeah I
usually don't but I'd say I'm going to
put a 90 odds of no famine
and the reason is that
humans are just really really good at
responding to a known problem with
enough time to respond and one way or
another I feel like we might be able to
you know get by now I don't think the
famine is for the First World countries
it's going to be for who can't afford to
pay massive prices to get the limited
food but I feel like we'll figure out
how to keep them alive long enough to
get the next crop going
that's what I feel but we'll see yeah
Africa could be tough in Africa don't I
don't want to minimize the risk but I'm
confident we'll figure it out
micro lessons on how to make a killer
tweet I can do that I feel like maybe I
have
um
all right
and Israeli a topic I didn't cover that
you just desperately need me to
ah
uh where where am I I'm at a secret
writer's Retreat location
are you able to smoke while on vacation
no comment
MTG was acquitted of what I don't even
know there was anything going on
market index is the market up or down
make the Sun bigger
um
well I could probably tell you now what
makes a killer a tweet
you want your killer tweet to be short
and something that people would want to
say to their friends so they could
remember it easily so has to be short
and clever
has to be on a something that's in the
headlines or people are really thinking
about right now
uh I burned my lip it's not it's not a
it's not a monkey pox or a weird disease
it's just a burn
all right
um
and uh
you should always be clever and
provocative and ideally say something
that's not quite true
if you say something that's provocative
and sort of almost true but not quite
you're going to get more energy because
people want to you know argue about how
true it is
yeah all right let's how about less
about me
maybe let's talk less about me uh
for a while
all right
um
talk about Trump's misspelled tweets
I think the misspelled tweets are not
intentional
but I think he leaves them intentionally
which is different
you know there's been a number of times
that I've had a typo and a tweet
and I've decided to leave it because it
was getting attention
so I think that's all that's happening
is Japan safe probably
give us the women's version of the men's
secret lesson I don't know if I could
uh I think cafi was probably just a
pocket dial
no hints
all right
um what was your inspiration for writing
God's debris if you don't know I wrote a
book called God's debris key Mountain
came out about the same time the Twin
Towers were falling I think
but uh these many years later my book
God's debris is still the thing that
people talk about the most when I'm out
in public
uh these days though they're more I
guess they're more often mention coffee
with Scott Adams but
um God's debris has really made a big
impact on people and the answer of how I
came up with it is I was in the shower
and one day all of the things I'd been
thinking about for decades I realize
we're all connected
and that if I put it in a book it would
blow your mind
because it was blowing my mind when I
thought about it so I thought well if
it's blowing my mind maybe it'll blow
somebody else's mind so I put it in a
book
and when you find out how all these
things come together
you might enjoy it
yeah blew your mind good
good it is designed to blow your mind
and
the uh the context of that is that I
used hypnosis technique in the writing
uh if you use hypnosis technique in the
writing you can get some powerful
results so that's what I did
um
that's my balcony that's not a fence
all right
2001 Space Odyssey terrible movie
2001 Space Odyssey is one of the
all-time worst movies
I would like to reenact a scene from
the movie 2001 Space Odyssey now don't
get bored
don't get bored uh
this is pretty interesting so far isn't
it uh
uh don't you like how the plot is moving
forward uh uh wow look at that ship
still uh uh is anybody gonna talk in
this movie uh
when do we stop looking at this
thing we've looked at the same
thing now for 10 minutes uh
that's my
description of 2001 literally one of the
worst movies ever made
the other worst movie was uh uh Titanic
if you if you recommend somebody uh
watch Titanic you're an
because no matter how much you like
Titanic it's way too long
and it doesn't have a good ending and
not only does it not have a good ending
it has a it has an ending that will give
you PTSD
why are you going to spend three hours
to give yourself a lifetime of PTSD
dumb don't do it Titanic terrible idea
for a movie
you know what's worse Schindler's List
oh my god
Schindler's List there's a specific
scene in there and I'm not going to
mention it that traumatized me for years
and still I was actually traumatized now
I get that we should all know how bad it
was you know you should you should know
the Holocaust was bad and and making it
emotional and bringing you into it
definitely has some some
um utility
but don't watch that for entertainment
if you want to give yourself brain
damage watch that movie I got brain
damage
that's not a joke
actual brain damage because it created
something in my mind that was unpleasant
and didn't go away if somebody put
something in your mind that stays there
it stays unpleasant and it never goes
away that's brain damage I had a brain
that didn't have that and now it does
it's brain damage that movie
gave me brain damage and that's not
hyperbole literal brain damage
and and people like given an award
why do you give an award to something
that gives you brain damage come on
I mean well I know why but
yeah Serenity is excellent
I agree
what about Stephen King
the only thing I can say about Stephen
King is that when you when you see him
tweet
you wonder how he could write a book
anybody else have that feeling
he he tweets like he's somebody who used
to know how to write a book
but something terrible has happened in
the meantime
like maybe maybe drugs
some kind of mental decline of some type
because if he's always been like this
is that smart enough to write a book
I don't know it looks like see the
problem is that even his criticisms
don't seem smart
there are lots of people I disagree with
but they don't look actually stupid
they look like just people you know
maybe they're confused or whatever but
they don't look stupid
you know if Jake Tapper says something I
don't like
he never sounds stupid
because he's not right but Stephen King
actually sounds stupid when he tweets
maybe he's just a bad Tweeter but it's
hard for me to reconcile the tweeting
with the fact that he wrote all these
popular books
um
maybe Joshua lisac could explain it to
us
because I already know the answer but
maybe maybe Joshua could explain that to
you but why is it he's writing all these
good books still and yet he seems like
he could be capable of that huh
what could possibly be the explanation
of that
um
that's one explanation
I don't know if it's the only
explanation but it's certainly one of
them
yeah all right that's enough for now no
I don't have monkey box I burned my lip
I hope that's the last time I have to
say that today
um and I'll talk to you tomorrow
