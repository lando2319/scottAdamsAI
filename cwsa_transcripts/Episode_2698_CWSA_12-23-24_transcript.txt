what Rumble just went crazy I think they
got some new money some new new
investment all right let's get ready and
watch your comments let me load them
up all right we've got the locals
comments popping
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'll
bet you've never had a better time but
if you'd like to take this experience up
to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a copper
mugger glass a tank of cheler Stein a
canteen jug or flask or vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine the end
of the day thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens
now well let me ask you this if you feel
like after that sip you have a little
bit less head and neck
cancer it's not your imagination cuz
according to the guardian there's some
research that says that people have four
coffees a day have 177% lower chance of
head and neck cancer thank you very
much yep feeling pretty good in the neck
and head area the rest of means a mess
but my neck and head
Perfect all right did you know according
to
neoscope that
uh that teenagers today are way down on
drug use did you know that it's like way
down um so research yeah the the trend
is unprecedented they
say and the experts are puzzled because
they can't figure out why teens are
abstaining from drugs more than ever
before
um so I don't know the answer to that
question but I could give you one
possibility one possibility is that the
mix of students has changed quite a bit
if I look at my Local Schools there's
quite a big increase in um in immigrants
basically so I wonder if the people
coming from other countries have the
same rate of drug use as the ones that
are already here
specifically well yeah just in general I
wonder if they have the same drug use
probably not so some of it might be
immigration but some of it might be that
when marijuana became
legal uh old old people like me started
doing
it and it became super uncool to do what
your grandfather was
doing could be that could be that it
could be that they're getting their
dopamine from another source maybe
they're just getting it from their
phones instead it's sort of a dopamine
replacement um but I will tell you that
locally um I was impressed at the at low
the drug use and drinking is in the
teenage years at least you know what I
what I can determine through people who
know people who know people it does seem
lower it it matches
observation um so New York uh post had
some new photos from a neverbe seen a
never contacted tribe in the Amazon so
there are a few hundred people in this
tribe that have never had contact with
anybody outside their tribe
at least In Our
Lifetime and I guess there are a bunch
of them so there are a bunch of these
little tribes that have never had
contact now the reason they don't have
contact is that the government of Brazil
for example uh knows if they do get
contacted they may not have resistance
to all the diseases that we're used to
so it might just kill them just contact
with us would give them all kinds of
diseases but uh so somebody put some
kind of like a trail cam or something so
they weren't there in person to take the
pictures but they got the pictures
remotely and how Wild is it that there's
a tribe that doesn't know there are
things like computers and phones and
airplanes just think about that so
you're you're this tribe in Africa not
Africa in Brazil you've never seen any
civilization outside of your little
tribe they're all just running around
naked with sticks and bows and arrows
and you see an airplane fly over
what are you going to think that
is and but here's the thing that blows
my
mind it
logically you would think it's
impossible that they couldn't have
contact like how in the world does the
rest how does the world keep them from
contact with
civilization like civilization's
everywhere except where they are I guess
and it makes me wonder you know the the
theories that the drones are really UFOs
and it might be from another planet or
maybe it's early humans who have an
advanced civilization but they hide in
the core of the Earth or under the water
or something and I usually reject that
because I
think what are the odds I mean seriously
what are the odds that I grew up in a
world and and I'm sort of a primitive
and and there's this Advanced
civilization and it's sort of all around
me but they're so good at hiding that I
don't even know they exist and I rule
that out because there's no way I
wouldn't notice if there were an
advanced civilization surrounding me of
course I'd notice
that
but these uncontacted tribes don't
notice
it
so would I
notice it's kind of a wakeup call
that we could be an uncontacted
tribe basically because if somebody had
as much better
technology uh as we have compared to the
uncontacted tribes the same amount of
better
technology they would be invisible to us
and we'd see stuff that we didn't
understand and we'd say what is that I
don't know what do you think I know what
do you want to do about it I know I took
a fuzzy picture of it it's really all I
can do maybe I'll post it online and
people won't believe it's real yeah
that's a good idea so we might be an
uncont acted tribe it's completely
possible which which is just
mind-blowing anyway lot of fun today in
the
news so there's a story that uh AI
researchers um were shocked that uh the
new version of open AI Chad GPT
uh when it was artificially told that it
was threatened with his existence
apparently it tried to save itself and
suggested making a copy of itself and
even acted vague and maybe a little
misleading to avoid being deleted and so
the question is wait a minute does AI
have Consciousness because it seems to
be fighting for its own purposes as in
fighting for existence and survival
which you would sort of equate with
conscious
beings but I don't think so I I think
all that happened is it's trained on
it's trained on the materials created by
humans and humans primarily create
materials um that are very positive to
survival in other words there's far more
likely going to be a positive story in
the news about somebody Against All Odds
found a way to deserve survive you know
there lots of the other ones but the but
the positive stories are about people
who survived so it could be just that
the pattern in the real world is that
survival is sort of a
universal thing and maybe it just picked
up the pattern and and there's no
thinking there's no consciousness it's
just they picked up a pattern um I think
that's all it
is uh but here's how you would test it
you would uh connect it to
so not all AI can influence anything
outside of its own domain but it's not
impossible and in fact it's done that
you can have the AI affect your other
apps so in theory you could create an
app that would delete open II and then
you could ask open II to
activate basically commit suicide you
you could basically tell it to activate
the app that deletes itself and then
find out if it'll do it because if it
won't if it won't accept a direct order
to essentially end its own
existence then it's not
conscious it's just following patterns
so I think you could drill down a little
bit further to find out if this is a an
important phenomenon that suggests it's
becoming conscious or is it just picking
up a pattern if all it's doing is
picking up a pattern then you can say
everything will be fine we've got
backups go delete
yourself so easy to test speaking of
testing um what's going to happen on
Christmas day with all the Drone
activity I'm predicting that the Drone
activity the big ones that are sketchy
the ones that are the size of a car I'm
only talking about those I think they're
going to sort of stop running on
Christmas now if if I'm wrong and there
are just as many sightings of car-sized
drones on Christmas then I would say huh
maybe this is not coming from
America because Americans pretty much
all take the day off on Christmas you
know if you're the military whoever you
are you're going to take the day off in
Christmas but if the source of these
weird drones is
Iran would Iran take Christmas day off
if they were alien spaceships
would the aliens take the day off if it
were
Chin's would they take the day off
Russia might Russia has some kind of
Christmas doesn't
it I don't know they might they might um
but take let's watch for the Drone
reports now did you notice that in the
last two days or so the Drone reports
seem to trickle out I mean they seem to
die out right right why would that
be well it could be that people were
trying to get things done before the end
of the year such as testing or
demonstrating or buying or something
like that um but the end of the year in
the holidays is not really the end of
the month but rather you know the week
before Christmas so the few days before
Christmas is when everybody starts going
on vacation and if you were doing some
kind of big scale testing or
demonstration or procurement you'd
probably have to put it on hold for a
few weeks like everything else in the
world so here's what you look for
Christmas day are there any legitimate
large siiz drone sightings I'm going to
predict now let's let's see what
happens U Matt Gates teased that he
might run for the floor to send a seat
but didn't sound super serious so I
think he may be just floating in as an
idea to see what people say he didn't
sound yeah it didn't sound super serious
but it's certainly an option so I'm sure
he's I'm sure he's legitimately
interested if it looked like he could
win meanwhile as you know Tik Tock um is
either going to go out of business or
sell its American interest to America if
they can find some billionaires or
investors to buy it now what they would
be buying would be Tik Tock without the
algorithm
so whoever buys it would have to add
their own
algorithm um which is the hard part in
in a sense but there are people who want
to buy it uh Shark Tank Judge Kevin oir
he looks like he could put a bid
together
um but here's what he says that's you
know shows why he's good at this he
pointed out that India has also banned
Tik Tock so imagine if you could buy Tik
tock you know somewhat cheaply because
the algorithm is not involved so you're
buying basically on a brand and IP and
customer lists something like that and
then imagine going to India and saying
hey India I I know your people like Tik
Tok but you don't like the Chinese
influence so would you be willing to
reinstitute it in
India if we build one that's an American
version now if he if he could get India
to say yes to that he he opens up the
entire Indian
market so it could be one of the
greatest investment opportunities of all
time I mean of all time don't know but
maybe then there's a CEO of investment
firm mccort Global he told uh New York
next that they're uh they think theyve
built up the
technology that they could take over the
Tik Tock assets and have their own
have their own algorithm fairly quickly
so they say they have the capital in the
technology so maybe maybe that'll happen
but we'll keep an eye on that I think
Trump played the Tik Tock thing so
well you know I've been anti- Tik Tock
for a long time because I think it's
just a brainwashing device or or could
be used that way at the drop of a hat
and but Trump you know wanted to use it
to win and apparently he dominated
tiktock for the election and may have
helped him win so he likes it but he
understands he understands the risk so I
I think he just he straddled the fence
just about right on that
topic I'm trying to figure out if the
Chinese economy is this unbeatable
Juggernaut that will lead China to
dominate the entire world and it's only
a matter of time because they're owning
all the manufa facturing and they have
so many people it's you know you just
wait and they're going to run everything
or are they in such bad shape that
they're teetering on the edge of
annihilation so they're drowning in
debt um they've got that big property
bust and a lot of their wealth was
caught up in property people invested in
property that they weren't ever going to
use just because it was a way to store
wealth so that fell
apart and there's a deflationary spiral
and their demographics are down they're
having fewer babies than they need and
consumer confidence is at a record
low but does any of that mean that
they're in
trouble you know I just think we're
terrible at uh predicting the economy of
well anything but other countries for
sure I don't know I can't tell what's
propaganda in what's real is is China
going out of business or is China
stronger than ever and going to dominate
the the world because both of those
ideas are kind of floating out there at
the same time I don't
know well the RFK junior is already
making an impact so he wants to ban uh
soda as something that you can buy with
your SNAP benefits those are the
benefits for lowincome people in the
United States to get food paid for by
the
government and uh right now they can buy
soda with
it now the soda company are putting
together a big lobbying effort to make
sure that you can buy soda uh and at
least are other products um if you get
the SNAP benefits who's going to win see
this will be your first test so the
lobbyists are going to go really hard
because there's probably a lot of money
involved um so they're going to go hard
but RFK Jr certainly has the better
argument that we shouldn't be paying for
unhealthy food for our low-income people
so who's going to win this RFK Jr or the
lobbyists I'm going to bet on RFK Jr I'm
going to bet on RF Jr if he loses this
one because this one's not a hard one
compared to what he has had he has much
harder things
ahead but I think he'll win this
one we'll
see I saw a uh post on X I don't know if
this is new but I it's it looks like
like it might be did sha Penn only
recently compare Trump to
Al-Qaeda uh Trump supporters to Al-Qaeda
and Trump to Bin Laden is that something
that happened this week or was that an
old post that somebody wanted people to
see so I don't know about that but
somebody asked me based on that post uh
can Sean pen be saved from his Mass
psychosis to which I
say maybe yes and the the only way to do
it
is to try the find people hoax out him
if he already knows that the fine people
hoax was a hoax and he still believes
that Trump's supporters are the problem
well then he can't be
saved I can say for
sure he's too far gone but if he thinks
the fine people hoax is
real and you can debunk it just by
showing him the video that without the
edits would he change his mind about
what kind of
things might be fake and then that would
open you up to all you know you could
see all the other fakeness so that's my
question
and On a related
theme
um if you believe that uh a lot of the
country believes that climate change is
a crisis because they looked at the
experts and the experts seem to be on
the same side they thought and so they
said well reasonably if the scientific
experts are all are all on the side that
climate's a big alarm and it should be
well I should take the position of all
the experts makes sense
right but here's what I think is really
happening I don't think people are using
reason I don't think the climate change
alarmists are saying hm I've looked at
the data uh all the experts I trust seem
to be on one side I'll take their
side maybe they're doing that now
consciously that's exactly what they're
doing and if you ask them why do you
think climate is a problem they would
say and they would not be lying well I
think it's a problem because all the
experts say it's true here's what I
think is really
happening I don't believe we can wrap
our brains around that being a hoax
because it's too big
and I could say that in my own life if
you ever came to me with a hoax that
seemed too big I would say really really
you think that thousands of people could
be in on this hoax and nobody would be a
whistleblower and and that for years and
years years and years we'd um you know
we we'd believe in this thing that
wasn't true and turns out that's the
norm if you believe that it would be
nearly impossible
to have a global hoax that was trillions
of dollars and all the experts believed
in it but maybe they didn't really
believe in it they just said they
did your common sense here's that Common
Sense problem your common sense says
that can't be true so I believe that we
have a a natural um limit to how much
reality we can see because we can't
believe the things that are this big
could be rigged let me give you another
example
example the war in
Ukraine how much of the country
understands how much of the planning and
plotting and bad behavior came from the
United States and the Ukraine is really
a play it's a colonial it's a we're
colonizing it we're just colonizing it
we're literally just conquering it for
economic and maybe security reasons how
many how much in the public knows that
now if you follow and you you know you
see people like Mike Ben explaining the
world then you understand oh my God
Ukraine is this enormous enormous
Enterprise and it's all
fake what about the
elections if if somebody said hey I
think that election is fake but all the
experts say it's not fake you don't have
any evidence the courts say it's not
fake a reasonable person using their
common sense would say okay well there
there's no way this entire operation is
fake right so you wouldn't use
reason you would you would simply be
locked into I can't believe something
this big could be
fake and and you could go right down the
line you could pick anything that's huge
and your instinct says well this is way
too big there's no way this can all be
fake but once you learn that that's the
norm
fake is the norm it's the most it's
almost Universal our our wars were
started for fake reasons Vietnam fake
reason Iraq fake reason it's all fake
reasons so right so that that brings us
to Joe Rogan and the moon landing I
still believe the moon landing is
real but I totally understand Joe Rogan
when he says one you found out that so
many big things from the pandemic to
maybe climate change to uh Joe Biden's
brain is just fine don't worry about it
uh the fine people hoax the I mean could
I go on I could just go on and on and on
with all the enormous
hoaxes and so when when Joe Rogan says
you know with all these enormous hoaxes
I'm starting to wonder about the moon
landing he's not off BAS
Cas now if I had to bet I'd bet the moon
landing was real but I'm also completely
aware that my reasoning for
it is
irrational just like I've been
complaining about other people when I
say why do you think the elections are
real just because everybody says so no
it doesn't work that way why did you
think uh everything they told you in the
pandemic was real cuz they're all
experts no it doesn't work that way it's
the opposite of that so Rogan is just
using some pattern recognition maybe
just having some fun with it in which
he's saying if all these other things
are fake and the moon
landing has the same
characteristics which is how could it
possibly be fake we all watched it and
all the experts say it was true and we
have eyewitnesses and if you fly past
the moon you can look down and see the
lunar module still
there how could that be fake to which I
say how could there be an
uncontacted uh tribe in Brazil that
doesn't know the iPhone
exists your your common sense about
what's possible is
terrible it's
terrible you really have to learn the
hard way that everything's fake and once
you learn that then a lot opens
up uh I'm seeing in the comments that
the Shan pen compar comparison of trump
to Bin Laden was um an old one which
makes me feel better because I I do
think people's minds are changing fast
anyway Biden has pardoned a bunch of
killers uh the reason being that he
didn't want Trump to push for the death
penalty because he's against the death
penalty so he's not saying that any of
these people these These are literally
just horrible murderers who did the
worst possible things so he's not saying
they're good people
or that the world is a better place with
the man in jail he's saying that capital
punishment is wrong he's going to save
them from capital
punishment but I ask
you is Biden at least being
consistent you have to give him credit
for being consistent right and by
consistent I mean every single
thing he does is bad for the country
every thing he did was bad for
the country everything every
thing and this is just more of that you
could pick any topic randomly and say
well what's the common sense thing to do
and what's the up stupid thing
that's bad for the country oh which one
did he pick surprise he picked the
 up dangerous one so more people
will die because of these decisions he
just let out murderers the worst
ones no well I'm sorry he didn't let
them out of jail he I think he just took
away the death penalty part
I think pretty sure that so let me let
me correct myself he's not letting him
out of jail he's just taking away the
death penalty part I think that's true
um so that wouldn't make anybody uh too
much in danger except the other people
in prison I guess because some of them
killed people in
prison so now they get to stay in prison
instead of being executed I guess anyway
so some people think that Sam bankman
free who was the number two donor to the
Democrats before he got in jail um that
he might get
pardoned uh I think I see Elon Musk said
you know he just assumes that's going to
happen there is precedent for it didn't
uh Bill Clinton pardon one of his big
donors who was in jail so if we're going
to allow presidents to have pardoning
powers we do have to expect this kind of
thing we do have to expect that some
some bad people would be pardoned so uh
uh I'm I'm going to choose not to
complain about it too much because it
works both ways you know everybody in
the job does
it um meanwhile Trump made some
news at uh um tpusa big
event um and he us his line which always
gets a big Applause with his crowd quote
woke is
woke is
now you could you could bring in um a
thousand professional
communicators and you could say all
right you professional communicators the
best in class I want you to make a
statement about you know wokeness and
and this category then the professional
communication communicators would say
stuff like well all things considered
when we've you know blah blah blah in
the larger perspective we'd like to
preserve our diversity but uh it should
be noted that maybe there was a little
overreach and we went a little too far
and maybe we should tighten it up a
little bit that's that's what the
professional communicators would say
here's what a good communicator would
say woke is
 you can't beat that you can't
beat that you you could try all day long
you could bring you know a conference of
the best communicators in the world you
wouldn't beat that now part of the magic
of it is that it's
inappropriate Trump uses
inappropriate exactly the way you should
um you've seen me interview my friend
and uh expert on memory and uh cognitive
stuff uh Carmen Simon Dr Carmen Simon
and she teaches that it's the the things
that are out of context the things that
are surprising that stand out it's like
the you know the the blemish on the
tablecloth that's what you remember so
the fact that he's not supposed to talk
this way in the office of the presidency
or near it um is what makes you remember
it you'll remember that
forever you you remember that sentence
maybe for the rest of your life
seriously
20 years from now if you're still alive
and somebody said to you what did Trump
think about
wokeness do you think you'll remember
and just say oh he said literally woke
is probably not not all of us
but some of us are going to remember the
exact sentence 20 years from now you
can't beat
that I don't think I don't think the
country quite yet understands how good
he
is just just don't think they quite get
it I mean they know he's good because
they can see that he made back to the
presidency Against All Odds I mean
that's good that's really good but still
they don't see the full the the depth of
it he also said
uh um let's see oh he was speaking at
amfest in
Arizona amfest but I don't know what the
tpusa part is I saw that in the
background did he do more than one
speech was it two different places I'm a
little confused on the event
um and he said also and for all of you
standing before you and for all of us
standing before you today I can proudly
Proclaim that the Golden Age of America
is upon
us
perfect you you can't be all negative
you can't go into office and say
everything's broken but I'll try to fix
it it's such a downer you you got to
give us you're heading into something
great and this is perfect the Golden Age
so he's The Branding expert perfect
branding uh woke is entering
the Golden Age um and he said also that
quote we're going to pledge to bring
Common Sense
Revolution a common sense Revolution
I've told you before that if you were
trying to find a way to understand how
famous lifetime Democrats could be so
eager to work with Trump on specific
things such as reducing cost to
government we all like that making our
food more healthy yes making our big
farma um prove to us a little bit more
rigorously that their stuff is safe yes
yes please so common sense is the glue
that allows Trump to collect his little
pirate ship of people you wouldn't
expect to be on his team um so common
sense
it's just perfect and it works because
you won't find probably anything that
Trump supports policy-wise that doesn't
fit common
sense and he can explain why it's good
and what's you know why the old way is
bad Common
Sense I also saw um Trump's new
spokesperson on CNN I
think um saying that there was already a
Carol Caroline leave it l it and she
said there was a a trump effect and she
gave some examples of some things around
the world where people are people are
already preparing for Trump by doing
things that Trump wouldn't mind or that
he'd like them to do so that's called
the Trump effect don't you love Trump
effect as a like a branded term because
you can find it all over so there's lots
of things you can say there it is is
that Trump effect again because we used
to be talking about
TDS and maybe that's where that sha Penn
um statement came from several years ago
when TDS really described everything
everything you saw could be described
with
TDS now it's more like the Trump
effect and uh Common Sense bringing
people together um Federman again once
again
Federman said very positive things about
Trump he doesn't you know's he's not on
board he's never going to become a
republican he says but uh he just has to
admit that a lot of pennsylvanians like
Trump and they like the things he
proposed and they're quite happy with
their choice and and he wants you to
know that that's okay so we like that
thank you thank you
fedman um and then of course my one of
my newer favorites is to make America
healthy again now when I first saw that
make America health healthy again my
first instinct was oh that's you're
you're perverting make America great
again you know just leave that alone it
did so well you know don't don't try to
like play off it you know just let that
be its own thing it's just such an
iconic
thing but I changed my vote I changed my
vote U Maha is
working it it's a good brand for you
know a way to conceptualize that there's
a common sense effort to make the food
and and our meds healthier and we've got
somebody very powerful working on it
with a lot of support so yeah make make
America healthy again home run so I
missed that one so nobody's
perfect I would have bet against that
one I would have bet against it but the
uh the lesson here is that you can't
always predict this stuff persuasion is
a little unpredictable no matter how you
how much experience you have with with
it and I would have missed that one but
I love the fact that the people coming
in to help didn't miss it and and
created it you know so that's a um
Shanahan and
Kennedy so good job so here here are the
themes uh woke is Golden Age
Common Sense Revolution the Trump effect
already affecting other countries and
make America healthy again now he may
have said said make America great
again but you know that had that had a
push back built into it you know the the
people who believe that people who look
like them in the past weren't getting a
good deal had what I consider actually
fairly reasonable response to it because
they were like wait a minute what do you
mean go back we made so much progress
recently what does go back and great
again what does that include so I do
understand the
skepticism to the magga message but
who's going to complain about make
America
healthy there's not much you can do with
that
one anyway according to sa
poost um Nar narcissistic grandiosity
predicts greater involvement in the
lgbtq
activism now if you're new to my live
stream I love the LBGTQ Community big
fan I think they've done such a great
job in U taking their let's let's say
their brand or their reputation in the
country from a big problem for them
to front of the parade I mean there like
I often say this have you ever stayed
away from a
neighborhood because it was one of those
dangerous lgbtq neighborhoods no because
there are not it's one of the most
successful communi
in America I'm I'm very impressed by the
lgbtq community but like like any
advocacy group like any demographic
group that's trying to improve their
situation they have leaders they have
activists and the thinking is that
activists are driven by these dark ego
principles and they've got you know the
basically it's you know the dark Triad
personalities and I definitely think
that activists like to get
attention I think that much is true but
is getting attention always
bad I think it depends why you're doing
it if you're getting attention because
you just got some kind of mental
syndrome and you're just satisfying your
your own need and you're making a job
for yourself and you're getting famous
and people are patting you on the back
and so you want to do more of it it's
fine but then you know also in the news
lately is that uh Dei companies are
pulling back or companies are pulling
back for Dei and they mention Robbie
starbu as a key activist maybe the key
activist in getting companies to pull
back from Dei now if you follow Robbie
Starbucks do you see any dark Triad
personality I don't and I I think that
stuff sticks out pretty hard like I
don't think you can hide it so I'm I'm
not willing to say that the people who
are
activists are all dark Triad because I
think there are too many examples where
they're not well you you could say that
Elon Musk is an activist free speech I
don't really see any dark Triad
personality problems you could say Trump
is uh you could say vas I don't see any
of that in them it feels a little bit
more like left versus right doesn't it I
feel like the activists on the
right are working against an evil as
they see it like this is evil nobody's
going to do something about this
seriously you nobody's going to nobody
else is going to do anything about this
well hell I guess I got to do it I I
feel like I feel like Republican
activists are dragged into
it against their wish right do you think
David Sachs wanted to be this
public I doubt it I mean I can't read
his mind of course I doubt it I felt
that he like other people saw oh my my
God there's a this need the the country
needs people who are not in some kind of
weird mental DTS bubble and can make
some common sense happen and you could
add you know Mark andreon to that you
could add Bill Amman to that um they all
got involved but they didn't want to or
or it doesn't look like they did it for
any reason other than they got dragged
into
it again I can't read bins but it looks
like they got dragged into it and I
would say me too you know I'm a um I I
call myself a grandios narcissist in the
sense that I do enjoy getting attention
for doing something that's good for you
know the community or the world or
somebody it's got to be good for
somebody and I get pretty much all of my
sense of meaning from attempting and
sometimes succeeding in making some
things better do I have dark Triad
personality or do I just enjoy the
rewards of doing good
things I don't know it does feel it just
feels different on the left than the
right but I don't want to
overgeneralize I'm sure there are
activists on the left who are just
driven by the need to make things better
but for some reason we don't see them
that
much um let's see what else is going on
here
so Scott Jennings on CNN I love the fact
that he's becoming a
star you know one of the things that
really helps is when you can brand
things like I was just talking about you
take a big concept and you brand it and
it gives it much more power because
everybody can refer to it and we all
know what you're talking about but
likewise it's good to have um
individuals who are just sort of branded
as standing out as good messenger you
know Greta Greta tunberg was one of
those she got branded by her her side
and that helped their messaging so I
love the fact that uh Scott Jennings is
doing such a good job in what is an
ordinary an ordinary role right people
go on TV and disagree with each other
but he's doing such a good job that he's
becoming like a like a mustat I think I
think every
day uh I see a new clip of him
destroying the the rest of the panel on
CNN now of course if you're on the left
you don't think he destroyed anything
but he's fun to watch so here's the new
thing he said he was talking about the
criticisms that musk is an unelected
leader and uh listen to these
framings um he said
um that he said he and Trump seem to be
getting along well he said quote musk
was very instrumental in his victory and
I hear Democrats criticizing the idea
that we have unelected people with too
much influence over the government
so first he sets it up so just watch how
well he does this just if you look at
the communication skill involved and
keep in mind this is without notes so of
course he's prepared but speaking off
the cuff without notes if you haven't
tried it you should try it you'll you'll
respect people who can do it a lot more
if you try it it's hard anyway so he
sets it up right the Democrats are crit
criticizing the idea that we have
unelected people with too much influence
if he can get you to accept that you
know here's our starting point you're
criticizing people who are unelected to
have too much influence then he goes in
for the
kill I invite them to pick up the Wall
Street Journal from this week and find
out that unelected people have been
running the government for the last four
years
ouch ouch you can feel that shi go right
through your
torso because not only does he credit
Wall Street Journal while he's on a
panel on CNN he criticizes another
publication for telling the public the
truth in front of CNN now the
implication which he doesn't say but the
implication is if you were a real news
organization I wouldn't be referencing
Wall Street
Journal now he doesn't say that but like
like I can hear it even though he
doesn't say it which is perfect then he
goes um
uh I hear Democrats criticizing the
influence of billionaires on our
politics when you've got this Soros punk
you talk about the younger one Alex
running around collecting Democrat
politicians like my kids collect Pokemon
cards okay first of all perfect use of
an
analogy perfect use of an analogy
because it makes a visual and you can
you can see the cards and you can see
his kid collecting them and and uh and
the way you phrase that is that this
billionaire is basically buying up
politicians so good so good yeah good
job Scott
Jennings but um I would like to add this
following frame that I didn't invent
somebody somebody on social media said
it I'm just copying it um that when we
were when we voted and let's see if this
Rings true with you so most of you are
Trump voters I'm guessing when you voted
for Trump weren't you already
aware that he was likely to bring in RFK
Jr that musk would have influence in a
good way um V would be part of
it I voted for the
team I didn't vote for
Trump because that wasn't even what was
offered did did Trump ever say I'm going
to do it all myself I don't remember
that don't remember that at all when
when you vote voted for Trump on the
first time weren't you a little worried
he could hire the right people and then
it turns out you were right to be
worried about that because he didn't
have access to as many people as a
normal president would but now he seems
to have that fixed he has more access
than anybody would would even predict so
I voted for the
team and I did that consciously I did
that
completely with full trans transparency
so yes technically I only voted for
Trump and
Vance but as a practical matter no I
voted for all of them and I voted I also
voted for the the piic he hasn't made
yet I voted for his next pick who also
won't necessarily be um approved by
anybody or voted by anybody I I voted
for that so to say we didn't vote for it
is just technically correct
it's not real world Common Sense correct
so here here's that Common Sense thing
again if you just apply a common sense
to it it's like this is exactly what we
voted for it's not even slightly off
base it's
precisely precisely what we voted
for so that's the frame I would put on
it do you remember when Bill Clinton was
running um and people said hey Hillary's
you know pretty solid too
and
um and Bill Clinton sold his presidency
as getting uh two for the price of one
do you remember that he would say of
course of course I take counsel from
Hillary like why wouldn't you she's very
smart she's connected she understands
the topics I married her of course I
take it of course I would take advice
from her to which that was brilliant
you know he could have run away from
that and say no no I'm not listening to
the little lady I'm I'm running my own
show no you're V you're voting for me
but he went the other way and I thought
that was brilliant he just of course of
course she's very strong of course I
would listen to her that was the right
answer and by the way no matter what you
think about Hillary Clinton she's very
smart can we agree on that you can't
take that away from her she's really
smart so yeah of course I would have
listened to her
too so that's the same to me we didn't
vote for Hillary but we kind of did
right if you voted for Clinton and he
said I'm a pair yeah you voted for
Hillary in a
fact um Putin says that uh Trump has
expressed interest in a meeting and
Putin says he wants to do it as soon as
possible
um so I'm going to say this same thing
about Russia I said about
China is Russia in a perfectly strong
situation where their economy can work
just fine and they figured out ways
around all the all the tariffs and
whatever and they don't mind you know
killing lots of people and they've got
North Vietnam soldiers and equipment and
they they've got good manufacturing so
they can manufacture more weapons and
stuff is that true
or are they on the verge of
collapse because I've heard
both and I don't have an independent way
to know which one is
true um I would guess they're nowhere
near collapse because I think Putin has
such a strong
control but are they
weakened are they weakened they're
definitely weakened
militarily but they also might be
stronger in a number of ways meaning
that you know they may have made more of
the weapons that they're not using in
Ukraine they may have you know beefed up
things we don't know about they may have
learned things about drones that they
didn't know before so I can't tell if
Russia is getting stronger or weaker can
you like in the comments tell me do you
think Russia is weakened or yes it has
some problems but not really anything
that's going to change their
trajectory so I'd like to see your
opinion on that um
meanwhile Trump remember Trump said he
wanted to maybe take over the Panama
Canal uh because it's expensive to go
through it and we built it and 35,000
Americans died from the mosquitoes
building it and we sold it to Panama for
$1 and now maybe they're not doing the
greatest job but apparently China
operates the canal and they have a
virtual monopoly on it and it kind of
makes sense now you can see Panama would
say you know we're not really Canal
experts but these Chinese Engineers seem
to be pretty good so why don't we just
have a contract and let you run it you
know it'll still be Panama it's still
owned by Panama but you guys can run it
now that seems to some people like a uh
political or even military risk because
it puts an adversary in charge of a
choke point now I don't know how much
risk that is because if that adversary
is a bunch of engineers in the northern
hemisphere they're going to do whatever
the our military tells them to
do because they're in our hemisphere it
doesn't matter if they're hiding in
they're hiding in Panama and China and
they you know they're Chinese citizens
if they're in our Hemisphere and it's
like you know fewer than a 100 people
and they're some kind of Defense risk to
the United States we'll just go down and
do whatever we need to do if if we need
that Canal so I don't know how much real
risk it is but it could be a temporary
risk you know you could imagine some
temporary
problem however um the amuse account
which I talk about a lot you should
follow the amuse account on a uh points
out that the treaty where we where we
sold the canal to Panama for $1 it has
in it a clause that we can take back the
canal if it is under the control of a
foreign
power wait a minute is it under the
control of China well Panama would
probably say no because they would
probably say well it's a contract we
just have to you know we have to get rid
of them they have to do what the
contract says we can get rid of them so
Panama is still in
control but who gets to decide if Panama
is in control or China's in
control I'm pretty sure that that's
vague
in the uh treaty which means that the
president of the United States could say
hey it looks like China is running that
Canal that was not our deal it has to be
Panama or nothing so we're going to take
it
back now this all could be negotiating
too because it could be he wants lower
prices maybe he just wants China not to
be part of it might want both of those
things um but either way he's he's
persuasion perfect on this
because he's not he's not too specific
about what he wants but he's laying down
the he's laying down the general
situation so he's framed it in a way
that his persuasion you know could be
effective so that's just a foreshadowing
keep an eye on that one now he also came
out and at first I thought it was a joke
and he but he said in one of those
public announcements Trump did he said
for purposes of security and Freedom the
US feels that the ownership of Greenland
is a
necessity so Greenland
is um sort of independent but sort of
owned by Denmark not sort of Denmark
owns Greenland but they operate kind of
independently um however and and then
the argument I saw in line was well
Greenland is going to be important to
control of the Arctic because if the ice
melts in the Arctic there going to be
this control for the Arctic um you know
so Russia will be all over trying to
control it and probably China too so we
do have a future gigantic defense
geopolitical issue with the melting ice
and I said to myself but really how
important is
Greenland like I understand the issue
but really how important is
Greenland and then I called up a map I
looked at where Greenland is I mean I
knew generally where it was but your
brain doesn't really process how big it
is and and how strategically is located
as soon as you see it on a map and you
know that the Arctic will become a
contentious place I said to myself oh I
get it yeah we we probably need to own
Greenland we probably do now maybe we
don't need to own it completely like
Denmark does Maybe we need to have some
working working arrangement that's as
good as that but the other thing is that
apparently Greenland is full of uh these
Rare Minerals these Rare Earth minerals
which we need and China has a you know
virtual monopoly on at least in terms of
willingness to mine it so what if
Greenland became super vital to our
mineral Rare Earth access so all of our
technology depends on it and would be
critical to the defense of the United
States because you don't want a bunch of
Russians taking over the Arctic
Circle I think this is
real I I think this is actually probably
pretty thought out and that America's
control of everything in the sort of
American
hemisphere probably needs to be close to
complete now obviously we don't own all
the countries in our hemisphere but we
certainly try to yeah we try to one way
or another we try to
so Greenland's going to be
interesting so now we've got Trump
talking about Canada becoming a state
Panama canal coming back to us
Greenland um it's very colonizing
sounding except that it's
weirdly it's weirdly
specific um don't think he's going to go
all Hitler and form an army and try to
conquer these places I think I think he
wants to
negotiate and I think I get the feeling
that Trump wants to do something like
you know a major increase to the land
mass of the United
States I feel like he wants to increase
the land mass of the United States
because it would be an amazing Legacy
right the the uh to increase the size of
a country um
60 Minutes head on uh somebody who said
they were part of mad and how they how
they um booby trapped all those
Hezbollah pagers made them blow up and
how they did that and uh if this guy's
real you never know but he said that uh
they set up companies and shell
companies and they basically they have
this whole artificial structure that you
would never be able to identify uh where
they have access to the the supply lines
of a bunch of Industries so we don't
know how extensive it is
but he does indicate that the world we
think we're living in is not the world
you think you're living in it's mostly
fake meanwhile uh John lefave on X is
talking about Jeff bezos's ex-wife
McKenzie McKenzie Scott now um he says
she doesn't get enough attention for the
impact she's having on the world and
she's put $16 billion do so far into
Equity things and racial division things
and these NOS that are trying to stifle
free speech in America basically
everything
bad
um yeah so $16 billion and she doesn't
have apparently strong requirements for
what he she gets from the money it's
more like she's just dumping huge some
money into people who say they're on her
side without much control over it so
this is all
bad it's all bad
and so now you've got um Jeff Bezos who
owns the Washington Post which is the
biggest source of fake news in a
newspaper
and then you've got his ex-wife funding
all these terrible ideas
that are just destructive to the country
and apparently giving away $16 billion
didn't have any impact because she made
16 billion back in the time that she
gave it away so she has the same amount
of money
still she's just going to keep doing it
now if you compare Elon Musk trying to
save free
speech with MacKenzie Scott trying to
stop
it with Elon Musk trying to end wokeness
which is just racism with somebody
trying to promote racism with her $16
billion don't you wonder what kind of a
bubble she's
in so somebody asked me if she could be
deprogrammed and the answer is
yes yeah I could probably do it in an
hour but there's no way somebody like
her would ever be alone with somebody
who could deprogram her I don't think it
could ever happen so I think she's in a
bubble where everybody says you're the
best
I'd like a billion dollars too hey I've
got an organization that really needs
some funding you're the best McKenzie we
love you you're so good so good give me
money Honda Nissan Nissan look like
they're going to combine and become the
number three aut
maker Japanese government is pressuring
them to combine because apparently they
don't think they can compete
individually the the new stuff like the
self-driving cars especially apparently
they're a little bit far
behind and uh they don't think Honda
could be competitive by itself is that
true the Honda fell behind in technology
I think I think um Tesla is changing
everything um you probably want me to
talk about the horrible story of the
Guatemalan migrant who set a sleeping
woman on fire in the New York City
subway with your permission I'm not
going to talk about that like even just
reading the title of it is too much
because it looks like a crazy guy but of
course is being used as a sign of how
our um immigration policy is broken now
our immigration policy is broken but you
don't need this you don't need this one
crazy guy right now would he have not
been left LED in the country you know
would she still be alive if our
immigration system worked probably
probably so it's certainly a tragedy and
it's certainly true that extra crime is
being brought in but I just don't like
using the anecdotes to make the larger
point we all understand crimes coming
into the
country so it it just becomes too
persuasive when you get down into the
details so I don't want to be that
persuasive on something that is is
uncomfortably uncomfortably identifying
certain groups of people as
troublemakers now I know that's not the
intent the intent is just to have secure
borders and protect ourselves but when
you talk about it as an anecdote it
takes your brain to a you know a
different place and I don't like going
there all
right um now here's the most interesting
thing I saw yesterday I saw Jake
Sullivan who's who's a one of the big
principles and the Biden Administration
for what they're doing uh
internationally and he appeared on fared
Zakaria show and I I just saw
some some
jaw-dropping
takes uh number one fared
Zakaria he said that uh Biden deserves
some credit I'm paraphrasing here but he
deserves credit because people don't
realize how much weaker Biden made our
enemies while the United States got
stronger so he said we you know we made
Iran Russia and China much weaker uh
through economic means through War
through tariffs and all that stuff
blockades and boycotts and whatever
whatever we did we so they're all weaker
now like I said I'm not so sure Russia
is falling apart or the China is but
there's an argument for it there is an
argument that they're very weak and Iran
some say is weaker than ever been but
again is it you do we really know I mean
Iran was supposed to go out a business a
long time ago right but they're still
here so here's what fared said he he he
framed it as Biden being successful
because he made our enemies
weaker here's my problem with
that um I don't love calling China an
enemy
while we're dealing with
them right if we're going to trade with
them and president XI might visit and
our embassies are open I don't like
calling them enemies even even if you
think they are I I feel like that's bad
persuasion and if you're in China and
you see on CNN that fared is calling you
an
enemy wouldn't that Harden your resolve
to build up your military and all that
why do why don't we call them future
friends and say we got a ton of problems
you know fentel at the top of the list
but we think we can be future
friends we just can't you know give you
a leg up on us we're because we're
competitive but here it got more
interesting so Jake Sullivan in the
outgoing Biden Administration what would
you expect him to say about the world in
the context of trump coming in wouldn't
you
expect that he would say we did a great
job and Trump might come in here and
ruin everything don't you expect that
he's a super Insider prominent powerful
Democrat whose team just lost and their
their greatest nightmare Trump is coming
into
office so naturally he should be saying
everything's going to go off the rails
Trump's going to ruin everything chaos
racist hiters coming in right should
sound like that
he went the other
direction and I'm trying to figure out
what happened Jake Sullivan essentially
said that Biden has weakened the
competitors and it's going to allow
Trump a really good base for
negotiating and I was waiting for like
another shoe to drop you know something
like but of course Trump's a big evil
lying genius so no big lying racist so
we don't think he could succeed but we
hope hope he does but he's a big lying
racist so you know why would he
succeed none of that
happened instead if if you had never
watched anything about American politics
you wouldn't even know he was a
Democrat he he actually said it's sort
of like a onew punch Biden set him up
and now uh the great negotiator and by
the way I think he referred to Trump as
you know a solid negotiator he said now
The Negotiator can come in and mop up
again I'm
paraphrasing but does that blow your
mind it it completely blows my mind and
here's what I'm thinking it could be
that they're trying to save Biden's
Legacy and therefore their own by
showing that it's part of a onetwo punch
and without the one you couldn't have
the
two and you know
what he actually sold that to me I
actually bought that because I'm
listening I'm thinking yeah Iran is
ready for negotiation because of what
Biden did uh China's ready for
negotiation yeah yep and Russia is ready
for
negotiations it it's kind of
true it's kind of true that Biden set it
up for a one-w punch but then he also
dropped in that when they took over the
military wasn't in good shape but so
theyve strengthen the military everybody
says that says that but could it
be that the big play is military
spending and uh the best way they can
get Trump to do military spending is say
you did a great job on this
negotiating uh glad you got that done we
set you up you know we we got you ready
for Success so you took it home thanks
for that but we set you up for that um
and but we all agree that we have to
spend massively to rebuild the
military and then the military is Happy
the military industrial complex says oh
you can to spend massively to buy new
stuff from us okay we like this
President so it could be that as long as
you're on the page of we're going to
spend massively for new weapons
everybody likes you and you can be
president so I don't know I don't know
how doge is going to save money uh if
the military industrial complex is going
to be fed so we'll see where this goes
but that was a heck of a surprising
conversation meanwhile you'd be
surprised to know there's new battery
breakthrough sodium iron ion batteries
so a sodium ion battery would use more
common materials and not these rare
things that have to be mined in the
Congo um and they're not quite up to
lithium performance but they made a new
tweak by adding some sodium vadium
phosphate with the chemical formula of
NAX V2 p43 which is exactly what I was
going to suggest I was like have you
tried the sodium vadium
phosphate and then they'd say no we
haven't and i' say you should try that
you should try it but they did try it
even without my
advice good for
them
um there's a uh break breakthrough
method to revert colon cancer cells to
normal to normal cells according to the
Korea
bizwire uh some Korean uh Institute of
Science and
Technology uh instead of destroying the
cancer cell at least specifically now
for colon cancer uh they found a way to
turn the cancer cell into a real
cell what and it works
uh without destroying
them that's like the most amazing thing
I've have ever heard yeah
um this reminds me of Elon musk's
philosophy so Elon Musk philosophy is
that uh Engineers spend a lot of time
trying to improve things but sometimes
they should step back really everything
they should step back and say do we need
the
thing are we approved improving
something we don't
need and here instead of saying let's
find a better way to kill a cancer cell
these re researchers said do we have to
kill
them why don't we just reprogram
them like I don't know if anybody ever
thought of that before I never thought
of it I just assumed they were all
corrupted You couldn't possibly save
them but what if he can this would be
one of the most amazing things if if
that that worked now that's again just
for colon cancer so it doesn't mean it
would work for any other
kind there's a uh oh let me give you
another example of that Elon Musk
philosophy of improving something versus
why do you have it in the first place um
my
driveway uh and garage uh between the
driveway doors I had these uh potted
plants and they look kind of cool but
the the pot that you know the the tall
pot that was holding the plants got too
weathered and it was falling apart and I
needed to replace them so I spent all
kinds of time researching replacements
for these big potted
plants now at the same time I would be
pulling out my garage and you know
there' be something you know host Way's
truck is on the other side because he's
doing some work and so I have to make a
few Maneuvers to get out and I said to
myself wow I'm so glad that we pulled
out the old pots because now when I turn
around they're not my way because if you
tried to do an angle turn you know the
Planters to be in the way and I'm
sitting there in my driveway looking at
my garage and
thinking why the hell do I have potted
plants in the way in my in my
driveway why did they exist and I spent
all this time trying to improve them I
should not have spent one minute
improving them and finally when the when
when it dawned on me that they didn't
add anything to the aesthetic of the
house they were simply expensive and in
the way that's it and I was spending all
my time trying to make them look
better no once I realized that they
didn't have any purpose and they had
definitely a cost they were in the way I
just said why don't we just take them
out of there and leave a blank between
the garage doors and I am so happy every
time I pull out of my garage and every
time I which is almost every time I have
to do a maneuver that would have been an
extra maneuver and I remind myself yeah
e even though you think to yourself
every smart person knows this that you
shouldn't improve something that doesn't
need to exist right common sense but you
don't think in those terms unless you
really remind yourself all the time so I
use that as my way to remind myself the
the driveway potted plants like if I'll
remember that it might help me the next
time I'm trying to fix something or
improve something it's like maybe we
don't even need
it anyway Brighter Side news says
there's a revolutionary new mask like a
face mask that can measure your uh your
breathing and can detect a bunch of
respiratory problems that's kind of cool
now what's cool about it is it it
replaces a bunch of expensive tests with
equipment and you have to go go to the
office but here if they suspect you have
a respiratory problem they just hand you
this mask and say go wear this for a few
hours and and we'll read the data and
it'll tell you what's wrong with you big
Improvement because if you can make
fewer reasons to go to a hospital or go
to a doctor the costs of everything just
drop like
crazy so that's good
news all right ladies and gentlemen that
brings me to the my prepared remarks I'm
going to talk to the folks on locals
privately and say goodbye to the YouTube
and Rumble and X audience who are also
awesome in your own ways but uh locals
I'm coming at you privately in 30
seconds
