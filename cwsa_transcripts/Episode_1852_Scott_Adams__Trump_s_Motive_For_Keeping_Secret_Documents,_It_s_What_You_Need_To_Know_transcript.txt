well what's going on big congratulations
to greg gutfeld
who
woke up this morning to find that he was
trending

august
he beat uh colbert
i think he was like number three of all
shows at that time or something it
knocked knocked abc out of third place
normally the cable shows
are only competing with other cable
shows
it's hard for a cable show
to compete with a network
but i think he knocked out the third
place network
usually so he's just totally dominating
that space
and that one from uh hey why aren't
conservatives funnier to well there you
go
he's owning the space
so congratulations to greg guffeld just
killing it killing it lately
um
so there's a weird set of coincidences
happening
and i would like to give
you simulation alert
simulation alert simulation alert
simulation alert
i don't know if i'll ever go back to
that it didn't come out as awesome as i
hoped
but here's the story
you have to connect a few stories to see
the beauty of it
um in the news in vacaville which is not
too far from where i live a giant
tractor and trailer filled with tomatoes
spilled
and so the highway there was just
totally coated with tomatoes
in an unrelated story
or is it
another complete truck with alfredo
sauce
in memphis
spilled and covered the highway with
alfredo sauce
so we got our tomatoes we got our
alfredo sauce we're waiting for pasta
there was a big spill of chicken and
another one of wine
and but they're all in different places
need to get a little coordination here a
little coordination get them together
but who do you think gave me the
the tip off
that something was happening here
well the person who told me that a road
was full of spilled tomatoes and another
road was filled with alfredo sauce
his actual last name which he uses on
his twitter account is
skidmore
skidmore
that's right
i learned this story from somebody named
skidmore
and when i noted how coincidental it was
that roads covered with slippery stuff
would be tweeted to me by somebody named
skidmore
mr skidmore tweeted back and said
and i assume this is true
mr skidmore said by the way my dad made
car breaks for a living true story
his name was skidmore
and he made car breaks for a
living don't know what to think about
any of this really
i i assume it's just that we're noticing
it more
but it certainly seems like there are a
whole bunch of coincidences
here's the other coincidence i keep
running into
i keep running into people who know
personally
people who are in national news
like all the time
i'll say hey did you hear about somebody
somebody and somebody will say oh yeah i
went to school with him
what
really
yeah are you noticing that yourself the
number of people who are
in national news
who you know somebody who knows them
i feel like more of that's happening or
maybe it's just me i don't know
well
in the good news
category and very good news do you like
good news
do you like news about awesome things
happening to people and problems being
solved i know you do
so here's some
now this is a follow-up to something i
mentioned before so i had a video
that made some time ago
about how to deal with anxiety
and it was so well received and i was
surprised
people said it actually cured their
anxiety
imagine having anxiety and then having
it cured
by a video but that's what people said
and a number of people said it
and so i had a request to do another
video on social anxiety
you know the specifically the anxiety of
going to a group that you're not
familiar with or not comfortable with
and so i did a follow-up video that i
posted
to
my subscription platform locals
and the locals people looked at it and
said you have to make this public
in other words they thought the value
was sufficient that even though they
paid to have it privately
a number of them said all right we we
can't keep this private so you know put
it on um tweet it out so i tweeted it
out you can see it at the top of my
twitter feed
and it's a set of reframes
to help you walk into a room full of
people and just own it
do you think you could do that
does that sound even possible
so if there's somebody here who has like
extreme social anxiety
and you think to yourself
okay i've had this all my life
there's no way you're going to say
something in 11 minutes
that will just make me think differently
and then suddenly my biggest problem in
the world will just go away
and the answer is yes that's exactly
what i did
that is exactly what i did in 11 minutes
i will completely cure some of you
not all of you
everybody is too you know individual
you can't use one set of reframes that
just works on everybody that's not a
thing
but
there will be a tremendous amount of
people
probably at least hundreds
possibly thousands depends how many
people see it
but hundreds or thousands of people who
have the biggest problem in their life
just solved in 11 minutes
and
if you don't think that's possible
just watch the video even if you don't
have that problem
if you watch the video you're going to
go away saying
i think that actually could work
and you'd be right
so watch the comments and you'll see
that some people are having
a big impact
or there's a big impact
so this is additive to my anxiety thing
that mentioned the potato that's a
separate one
so
what are we supposed to think about the
so-called ukraine offensive
so this is what this is what cnn reports
and i think we could all agree
that everything we hear out of ukraine
is suspect
right
and the thing about war that's
especially suspect
and i was reminded of this
by newt gingrich's awesome documentary
about george washington
called the first citizen is that what
it's called
i i highly recommend it so it's an it's
a gingrich production
and
one of the things i didn't know about
the george washington story
is that he had completely lost
at one point
washington's army was basically just
wiped out
it was just a bunch of barefoot bleeding
people with no food
barely any of them left
and somehow he managed to pull it out
so the so the thing about uh the thing
about war
that we don't fully appreciate
is how surprising it could be
you know who was it who imagined that we
would go to afghanistan and the taliban
would basically win
all right a lot of smart people said
well that's not going to happen even
though it happened to russia
we thought well it's not going to happen
to us
we got better weapons we're smarter we
learn from them
that happen to us
so war is thoroughly unpredictable even
when you think it's not
so i would say that we really don't know
what would happen
with a ukraine offensive but here's some
of the things
that are being reported
cnn says it's early days of this
so-called ukraine counter-offensive to
regain territory
but it says uh in its early days ukraine
for ukrainian forces have already um
captured back four villages from the
russians
what do you think of that they've
recaptured four villages
now
that's probably kind of trivial
and one assumes that the russians are
not guarding everything with the same
amount of defense so i assume that those
were the easy targets you know lightly
defended places
so probably doesn't mean much all right
so so far
it's a lot of nothing
but here here's a little part i didn't
know
the
the counter offensive is gonna i think
it's aimed at curson trying to take that
city back
which i didn't i didn't realize was a
regional capital
so the only regional capital that the
russians conquered was kirsan and
and ukraine's trying to get it back
do they have a chance i don't know
i have no idea
um but apparently the ukrainian military
is a little pluckier than people
imagined
um you know some of these towns are so
deserted that i think recapturing them
probably doesn't mean much
you know there's probably nobody there
the russians probably didn't even care
like yeah you can have that one
um
reportedly ukrainian troops have broken
through russian defenses quote in
several areas of the front lines near
the city of kirsan
and some others
uh but i would say you shouldn't believe
anything coming out of the war zone so
who knows
but let me ask you this
do you think that the ukrainian military
would have staged a counter-offensive
if they didn't think they had the assets
to reasonably have a chance of
succeeding
is there anything about the ukrainians
that look suicidal
in other words are they are they
anything like let's say the
you know the first uh iran-iraq war
where the iranians would send you know
waves of human sacrifices you know
lightly armed across the machine gun
fields
it doesn't feel like that right
ukraine looks like they're a
well-trained force
i think
nato and americans help train them so if
you have a well-trained military force
so let me ask you this question
if you have a well-trained military
force
and they stage a major operation which
the counter-offensive is
would you assume that they're doing it
with no chance of winning
in their own estimation do you think
they said themselves well we have no
chance of winning
but we have to do it anyway for some
some reason
i don't think they would do the
counter-offensive unless they thought
they had a chance
and why would we second-guess them
they're actually putting their lives on
the line
lives
they're betting their lives that they
have a chance
if you see professional a professional
well-trained military
betting their lives because they don't
have to do this right they could just
say
all right you got that territory we'll
just keep this territory we'll see if we
can stabilize this they don't have to do
this
so if i see a well-trained
probably well-equipped at least in terms
of modern equipment well-equipped
military
do it going on a counter-offensive
don't you have to assume they have a
chance
is that crazy
now i know that we all think okay they
don't really have a chance against
russia
ultimately
like ultimately putin could win anything
you wanted to win you just have to put
enough resources on
but why would they do it
can you think of any reason that ukraine
would even attempt to do it because
they'd have to have any losses
presumably
in world war one
they did suicidal charges
but do you see that happening in ukraine
yeah i'm not going to i'm not going to
say that nobody else ever did a suicide
charge gallipoli
and why did they do that at gallipoli
so so here's the thing a a suicidal
attack
can make sense
if you're trying to capture something of
utmost importance
right
if you say all right we have very little
chance of taking this hill but if we
don't take this hill we're all dead
so we're going to do a suicide attack on
this hill maybe we get lucky maybe we
get the hill and then it changes the
fate of the war
but that's not what's happening in
ukraine
the the territory that russia took and
they're trying to retake
feels optional
right
it feels optional like they don't have
to do the counter-attack so that makes
me suspect that they have a little more
chance than the media is giving them
well npr has a big article today which
is
the content of which is surprising for
npr but it's a sign of the times
and the title of npr's article is why
even environmentalists are supporting
nuclear power today
and it
and it mentions you know michael
schellenberger's efforts and some others
stuart brand i think
somebody else and it talks about how
people who had been associated with the
environmental movement
were the you know some of the most
effective people in getting nuclear
power back to a you know a respectable
place in our minds
and
i'm reminded uh because michael
schellenberg was retweeting some of
these stories and such
and
you forget
you forget where the national opinion
was on nuclear
just five years ago
is this one of the most amazing
what would it be uh persuasion
would you call it persuasion
i think this is one of the best examples
of successful persuasion
i've ever seen
what would you say
have you ever seen anything that worked
because five years is a pretty short
time
to turn around
something that was
i don't know 20 years of truth
and it got unwound in maybe five
yeah so
i would say you know if there was any
kind of uh academy award or anything for
persuasion
the
the successful nuclear persuasion to put
it back in the
in the mix for the future
is one of the greatest things that's
ever happened in america i think and
maybe the world i mean it's an it's an
amazing accomplishment but i don't know
if everybody's going to get the credit
that they deserve
but it's pretty amazing
meanwhile california is warning that
where i am
that they're going to be
turning off the electricity every now
and then because it's going to get
really hot this week i guess
so starting today
my my
my city could be asking me to turn off
my ac
now i told you that the my power company
called me and asked if they could have
control over my ac
in my house
did i tell you that
so apparently they have some technology
they can hook to my system and they can
turn off my ac
if i give them permission to do that
now that
now
let me clarify it's not nearly as bad as
you think
right
if your first thought is that's the
worst thing i ever heard is not as bad
as you think
what they promised to do
and of course you have to you'd have to
trust them right what they promised to
do
is that in a very limited situation you
know an emergency they would turn off
some people's ac for 15 minutes
just to get past the the tough part
and if they turned off some people's ac
for 15 minutes
the temperature your house might go up
two degrees
on average two degrees
and then it would come back on
and then we'll come back on and then
you'd go back down the two degrees would
you notice it
would you notice it you might
but it wouldn't be the biggest problem
in the world right that's the 15 minutes
you could go do an errand
so i don't think it's going to happen at
night it's going to happen in the middle
of the day
now
over on locals everybody's saying nope
nope so that's what i said
so after they went through the pitch
that you know this would be no big deal
and it'd be good for everybody
you know what my answer was
nope nope
you do not get more control over my
resources
you do not get more control over my life
you haven't earned it
haven't earned it
there is you could imagine
and let me see if let me test this with
you
if the last five years of your
experience had been different
could you imagine saying yes to that i
could
i could
i could easily imagine say you know
my government's done a great job
my government's done a great job and if
they need me to pitch in
i'll pitch in
but they have not earned that
they have not earned
any trust
so this is what this is how expensive
that lack of trust is
because i absolutely would have said yes
to that if i trusted my government
and i don't
with anything
it's the worst it's ever been in terms
of trust
so
you got to fix that you better fix your
trust
it's expensive
all right my biggest curiosity about the
news is
why the hell
did trump keep
top secret documents allegedly
isn't something missing in the story
what's the biggest part missing in the
story
why what was his motive
how do you have the story go this far
when nobody's even speculated a motive
so let me show you the um so here are
the
oh so we saw a picture of the documents
so now we know that there are some
documents in mar-a-lago that are labeled
with top classification cover letters
so the thing that we're pretty sure is
true i don't think it's a fake picture
but it looks like it's a bunch of things
marked
high security
right
so here are the possible reasons that
trump would do this
if he did it
so assuming that what has been reported
is true
that there was some resistance to giving
things back
and that they are confidential and that
they are
you know
or were at mar-a-lago
and it is further complicated
by the new information that some of
these were in his office
so some of the ones that were marked
with these high classifications were in
his office not just in that store room
which is worse right because the office
is lower security
so here are the possible reasons i could
think of
why trump would want to keep these top
secret documents or at least how we got
here
number one
he wanted to keep some blackmail or dirt
on the deep state for his own protection
all right
you can imagine that right you can
imagine he would want to protect himself
by having some blackmail on somebody
else
right possibility now would that be one
that we would not be told
because that would explain why we're not
told what's in there right
how about he kept them for uh the
benefit of a future biography
he wants a book written and he wants
some original documents that the
biographer can look at
to get it all right
seems like he could have just
unclassified those and taken a copy
right
because the government owns the
originals
but if he had declassified it
he could just make a copy and give it to
the biographer now that doesn't mean he
went through the process of doing that
but
one possibility he wanted it for a
biography
another possibility the democrats would
say is that he wanted it for treason
treason
he wanted to sell these documents or to
sell out the country
not likely but that's what the democrats
would say
number four he didn't know he had them
did not know he had them does that seem
even a little bit possible that he
didn't know he had them and maybe he
kept saying i gave them back and then he
didn't know he had them
we'll talk about that
number five
the documents were planted by the fbi
and were not there at all
possible
i hate to say it but it is
i think it's a very low possibility
but we don't we no longer live in a
world where you can say there's zero
chance of that it's definitely not a
zero
the fbi is known to make up evidence
recently
specifically about this president
so they made up you know if the steele
dossier got as far as it did
this could easily be completely made up
it could be
i think that's a very low chance
but it could be get ruled out
um and then the sixth one that the
documents are just mislabeled or off
over classified
i'm now going to tell you the answer
there is one answer that is glaringly
obvious
which one do you think it is
there's a glaringly obvious explanation
for this
which one is it
you want to hear the uh
yeah
okay you all got the right answer
i was going to tease this out for a
little bit longer
let me tell you what
a dilbert organization looks like
now this happens to be one of the very
few things
that i have expertise on
i i believe i can claim expertise on
a large organization inefficiency
would you give me that as the as the
you know 34 years or whatever of drawing
dilbert do you think i have a good sense
of how organizations act incompetently
i do
i'm an expert
here's what
this situation looked like to me
uh hi this is the gsa
we've got some records to say some
documents are at mar-a-lago
um who am i talking to
uh oh i'm some assistant person at
mar-a-lago
okay can you help us figure out how to
get those documents back
sure
i'll add it to my list of 45 things i'm
doing
and then after you get off the phone
it's like i got 45 things to do today
where is uh where is returning documents
that are just sitting in a box in a
warehouse it's last this last well i'll
work on the other stuff
a couple weeks go by ring
how was the progress on getting those
documents back oh oh the documents
documents yeah i'm getting on that
um and
and uh you know i'll tell you what i'll
be done by the end of today i swear i'm
sorry i waited so long yeah i got it
so then the person goes into the
warehouse looks around
finds some documents that are like easy
to find and they they say they're secure
gathers them up it's probably a whole
process of you know record keeping and
who's who's watching and who has access
so it's probably a big operation
just to gather up some documents and get
them to where they need to be okay
so the person gathers up some documents
and
gets them over to the gsa and now weeks
have gone by
why have weeks gone by for something
that should have taken one day
why
why did it take weeks
for something that your common sense
should take one day
here's why because everything takes
weeks
everything
everything
you just name anything it takes weeks
so now you got the second phone call and
now some documents have been returned
what happens in the real world
next
in the real world
every time
you can guarantee it you can go to the
bank on it you've returned all the
documents what happens next
what happens next every time
you know what happens next one more
thing
one more thing
well i'm looking at my records
and i'm pretty sure you missed some
so could you put that back on the top of
your priority to go look and really
really tear down that room and really
find those documents
and the person who's the underling to
trump
says
[Applause]
how important is this really
is it really important
and they put it at the bottom of their
to-do list
two weeks later the gsa says we're not
 around
we really are serious about these
documents and the guy says i know i know
i'm trying to help did the best i could
and i swear i'm gonna get to go look for
those other documents
and then that guy goes on vacation
because it's summer
two weeks go by
because the only person who was working
on is on vacation just like everybody
right two-week vacation
and then the gsa says all right you
we thought this would be easy we thought
we could work with you we thought we
could just get some answers but you
won't do it we're going to call in the
authorities
you tell me it didn't happen like that
right
now
i'm guessing that there's going to be
some kind of a hybrid of what i just
described
plus trump wanting to keep some
documents for whatever reason
right
probably trump is going to say some of
those documents i did want to keep
i thought i i thought i'd declassify
them maybe there's a question of whether
it was done right or done on time
and maybe a few of them he wanted to
keep
but they got confused with the ones that
he didn't want to keep and nobody knew
which ones had been connected and did
they get them all and why does my list
not match your list
by far
by far by i'd say
20 to one odds
this is just
confusion
now let me ask you this
if trump believed that he had
declassified something
did they take the cover page off
the the moment that a secret document
that's labeled secret and is in storage
at mar-a-lago or anywhere i guess in
storage the moment they declassify that
does somebody run over and rip the cover
page off
i don't think so
because again not in the real world
in the real world you just say oh all
those boxes are declassified all right
and then you just walk away or you write
it down somewhere but you're not taking
the cover page off them i doubt it i
mean maybe you should that would make
sense
here's another category
how about things that at one time were
very sensitive
but it's now obvious that they're not
that would describe a big category
wouldn't it
at one time it was very secret but now
it's not
yeah just on a date stuff like that do
you think that the president could have
said all right let's look at some of
these secret things and he just flipped
through him and said none of this
stuff's secret
this doesn't even look slightly secret
so just treat it like it's not just keep
it
maybe something like that
so
somewhere in this story
there is an individual we don't know who
yet
who was taking orders from trump at the
same time
as taking orders from the gsa
right
there's somebody in the story whose name
i don't know
who was that person at mar-a-lago
who was in between trump and the gsa
do you think that person
had an easy job
no because it probably went like this mr
trump mr trump
can i have one second with you and trump
looks over and sees as the document
person again
he's like oh
like i really want to have a one more
conversation with the document person
do you know what is more interesting
than talking to the document person
everything
absolutely everything i was going to do
today is more interesting than having
another conversation
with the document person
right so do you think he gave like
really good complete answers to the
document person
and that person oh thank you for your
time and i appreciate that you took two
hours to go down there and look through
those
boxes
you know so we'd really have a complete
answer for the gsa that didn't happen
there was some poor bastard
which is weird because it sounds male
what's the female equivalent of a
bastard
don't tell me but there's somebody who
was in the middle and it had to be that
it had to be
now on top of that there might be a
document that there's some question
that trump thinks is is not secret that
the government thinks is so so there's
probably some disagreement
of some of that
all right here's how uh maggie haberman
spends her lives in the new york times
she says among the new disclosure in the
36 page filing
were that the search yielded to three
classified documents in desks inside mr
trump's office
holy
three classified documents inside his
desk
so that's worse than being in that
locked closet
with more than 100 documents in 13 boxes
or containers with classifications
markings
in the residence including blah blah
that's interesting so the ones found in
trump's desk are described as classified
documents
right so the ones in his desk
are called classified documents the ones
that are in the box
are described in the same article in the
same paragraph by the same writer as
things that are marked confidential
interesting so the ones in his desk
are confidential
but the ones that were in the boxes are
marked confidential
you see the trick
it's right there
it's right there
it's not hidden
she's making a distinction between
things marked confidential which very
well could not be confidential
very well could not be
versus stating that the ones in the desk
are confidential
which is a higher level of certainty
than the story provides
the story doesn't say that they are
confidential
the story says they're marked
confidential and she knows that
because she said it in the same
paragraph
in the same paragraph
she said they're marked confidential as
she said they are confidential in the
desk
that ladies and gentlemen
is propaganda
that's not reporting
that's propaganda
all right
and then the investigators developed
evidence that quote
government records were likely concealed
and removed from the storage room
well if they found some in his desk
is that the entire argument for there
could be evidence that they had been
moved
right
maybe that's the entire argument if some
of them were in his desk that would
indicate that they used to be in the
storage room and somehow they got the
desk so that would indicate they'd been
moved
that might be all it is
but it's also possible that they were
just stored in two different places from
the start
and some of them ended up in his office
or something
so i've got a feeling that just the fact
that the documents were in more than one
place
maybe their entire argument
that there's evidence that they tried to
move them
and i'm not sure that those those facts
quite connect sounds like there could be
other explanations
all right
so i think it's going to come down to
some disagreement where trump says i
thought these were
not secret
and then the government is going to say
we think that they are
and then what is the court the system
going to do
when it's a when it's a difference of
opinion
where trump has an argument where maybe
it isn't even a good argument but it's
an argument because i thought they were
all non-secret
and i thought we gave them all back
i don't i don't know that
any jury is going to convict him for
that right
you don't do you think you get 12 jurors
to believe that his intention was bad
that his intention was bad i don't think
so
i don't think so you think a dc jury
would buy it
yeah maybe that's riskier dc jury that's
true
all right
um
so that's that story is so
i i hate having stories where we're
guessing at what's
what's in some document or investigation
i mean this is basically just russia
collusion version 2.0 right or 3.0 at
this point because january 6 was 2.0
so this is just a russia collusion 3.0
i would not trust anything that the fbi
says on this
um
representative eric swalwell
tweets he said a staffer of mine who's
one month into her job
receives a call from a man saying he's
coming to our office with an assault
rifle to kill me
i hesitate to share this but how else do
i tell you we're in a violent times and
the architects are trump and mccarthy
bloodshed is coming
so
now keep in mind that swalwell is a
california representative i think i
think he represents me i'm not sure
uh because i moved since since then but
i didn't move far
um
here's what i said
first of all
i i re retweeted with a comment and i
said uh
there's beyond horrible
all right so let's all agree that this
is horrible and that's not up for debate
and and i also hope the caller is
already in jail because i don't know how
he wouldn't be
right
i hope the caller is already in jail
because
you know i have zero
tolerance for even the threat of
violence in this kind of context
however
because i don't have a boss i get to say
things that you can't say
isn't that fun
i get to say in public something you
could never say here's something you can
never say in public but i can
i can so i'll do it for you
and i tweeted
you know it's beyond horrible i hope the
caller is in jail and then i said that
said
if your job performance is such that the
people you represent want to murder you
some self-reflection is an order
a little bit of self-reflection
now i get the public figures are often
threatened i get that right
and uh you know i'm completely opposed
to that hundred and
thousand percent
but i think this is a special case
now people said to me based on my tweet
would you say the same thing about
kavanaugh
do you think kavanaugh
should do some self-reflection because
somebody threatened to kill him
to which i say you don't need
self-reflection
if the answer is obvious
he ruled on abortion
people didn't like it so they wanted him
dead
there's no self-reflection required
about your job performance
because it wasn't about his job
performance they just didn't like the
outcome
there's there's a big difference between
there's something so bad with your job
performance that we want to kill you
versus we don't like that outcome but at
least the process was followed
so i think there's a big difference
between somebody who has a specific
reason
to be targeted which again i'm
completely against 100 percent
uh
versus someone whose job performance is
such
that in general people want to kill you
if people want to kill you in general
because i don't think this is based on a
specific thing
i feel like it was in general
then you should at least ask yourself is
there something i did
the the
funniest comic of all time
uh i wish i could remember who did it
god i can't remember who did it it was a
comic of uh one panel comic of a
prisoner in jail
and he was you know making markings on
the wall to count something up he says
to his bunkmate in jail he goes 19
arrests 19 convictions
maybe it's me
i've been laughing about that for 30
years
19 arrests 19 convictions maybe it's me
maybe it's me
and i feel like
swalwell's rhetoric
is the kind of rhetoric that makes the
world more dangerous
and i think that he needs to examine his
rhetoric
because even in this very
this very tweet
he said bloodshed is coming
that's not what you say if you're trying
to avoid bloodshed
is it
if you're you know it would be different
if you and i said it because we're not
elected officials if an elected official
says bloodshed is coming
that causes bloodshed doesn't it or at
least it
promotes it
and again freedom of speech blah blah so
you and i can say any crazy thing we
want freedom of speech
as can he because he has freedom of
speech as well but on top of his freedom
of speech he's got a job
that we elected him for
he also has to do the job
right he doesn't get to say oh freedom
of speech so i didn't do the job no the
job
is to manage manage the the nation
i don't think saying that bloodshed is
coming as managing the nation very well
i don't think that
uh saying things that are obviously
intended to get the
the republicans fired up
in sort of an overactive way i don't
feel like that's trying to reduce
violence
you know to reduce violence
here's what would reduce violence
just to be clear
if trump didn't violate any laws
i'd like to know that too
so we could clear him and move on with
business or something like that i'd like
to hear swallow waste swalwell say
something
that makes him understand that
republicans are not
worthy of death basically
say something just anything that
acknowledges some respect for the other
side even if you disagree just show some
respect for the other side
and he doesn't do that
that's the part he should re-examine
because he would not only be more
i think more effective so make him
make him do better do his job better
but
there's a reason
that some politicians attract more
more negative attention than others and
i think he's got to examine his
rhetoric there
now i'd say the same thing about trump
by the way
you know
presidents get a lot of death threats
but trump's rhetoric certainly invites
it
so
if you need me to be consistent
i would say yeah he's trump needs to
examine his rhetoric as well that's
something i've never been comfortable
with
so i'll say the same thing for him
all right um
rasmussen did a little poll on electric
cars and 28 of americans
believe that electric cars are practical
today for most drivers only 28 percent
think an electric car is practical now i
don't think they mean
economical
but maybe that's how they interpret it
like they're too expensive
but the biggest problem is that people
think they'll have trouble getting them
charged i think
54 percent think electric cars aren't
practical
interesting
here's what i think
i think the arc of our knowledge about
electric cars
mirrors
the argument about uh nuclear power
the public had an impression in their
mind that nuclear power was negative for
a number of reasons
and it took years of persuasion
to convince them that not only had
things changed like there was better
information there was better ways to
handle waste etc but it took a long time
to educate the people that the thing
they worried about wasn't true
electric cars are still in people's
minds about five years behind
or let me say that better
people's understanding of electric cars
is five years behind
very much like people's understanding of
nuclear power
uh was years behind
there's some who comes on here
just to
say he's bored
really all the things you had to do
today
you wanted to go somewhere where you
knew you were bored to tell people you
were bored
do you think you could reach
any more spectacular level of being
completely useless in society
is there anything you could do that
would be worth less than that
maybe piss on your own breakfast before
eating it
can you even think of something that
would be
worse use of your time
well
i'm sure you will
uh
all right
[Applause]
so is the word is the world falling
apart or getting better what do you
think
are things getting worse or better
worse
worse worse worse you think we're worse
than
the pandemic
i know it seems better than the pandemic
it's a little both
we've got quite a few
quite a few trolls here
just getting rid of some of them
got quite a few today
all right so here's my uh last
provocative statement
um
i know
can we agree that none of us want masked
mandates
is there even one person here who wants
a mask that's probably not right so
we're not arguing masks okay we agree
that we're not going to talk about masks
i just want to make one comment about
expertise
because uh
andres beckhaus
pointed me to an article because it was
in a context of people arguing about
masks
an article that seemed to indicate
a positive benefit of masks
but then when you dig into the article
you learn that the person who says that
masks probably work
is an engineer not a doctor
an engineer
now here's my
here's my claim
that percent of engineers will say masks
work
100
once they hear the argument you know not
today
but once they hear the argument 100 of
engineers will say mass quirk
but
not 100 of doctors
so there's an engineer who thinks that
the water that's on the inside of the
mask doesn't have any virus in it no i
could talk you out of that in about
30 seconds
you know if you believe that you're an
engineer and you think masks don't work
then you have to explain how the water
on the inside of the mask the moisture
how did it lose all of its virus where'd
that virus go
now here's the only thing i'll say
the rogue doctors who say masks don't
work and i say they don't work in a
macro level they don't work enough to
have a mandate for sure
but the rogue doctors
they have an a little bit of an
inconsistency
because the rogue doctors will tell you
that the amount of virus that you
initially come in contact with makes a
difference to how sick you get
right that hasn't changed has it the the
medical consensus is that the more virus
you're initially
exposed to the worse it'll be
because your body will have less time to
catch up
how does this guy keep come coming back
after i hide him is he just changing his
changing his name that quickly
there's somebody who's really really
he's really really putting in the work
this morning
good job
good job joel
because of all the things you could do
to better yourself
coming over here and changing your name
really rapidly to troll me
yeah it's interesting so it looks like
there's a whole army of them coming over
now they're all doing the same comment
is it just one guy changing his name
quickly
you can't tell
very very
he
is very energetic
these are bots who have a mission or
they have a mission
well you you've taken worthlessness to a
new level all right here's my only point
the rogue doctors have a consistency
problem they say i think they would say
that the amount of viral load matters
and they would also say that masks
don't work
the engineer would say
if it's true that the amount of viral
load matters then engineers work and
masks have to work somewhat
even if only a little bit
so the engineers are consistent
they might be wrong anything's possible
but what the engineers say is consistent
internally
if viral load matters and a little bit
of the virus gets on the mask
then that's a little bit of virus that
didn't get in the person
because it was kept in the mask
to me
yeah to me the engineer opinion is the
consistent one
the doctor one is the inconsistent one
but we all agree that we don't see any
difference in the statistics right
there's no city that
didn't wear masks and tripled their
death rate or anything like that there's
just no there's no macro evidence that
worked at all
that i'm aware of
hide user
i do it makes me curious that the trolls
make me curious is it just the
attention is that is that the only
reason that they do it
are they just broken people
is there just something wrong with it
how they were raised or something
subscriber only mode will help with
trolls
oh
so somebody's suggesting that there's a
subscriber only model
for
for youtube
is that true
so i could limit the comments to only
people who would subscribe to my channel
well that's going to happen
oh well what how did i go this far
without knowing this
all right well we're going to make that
change
so um if there are people who here who
have not subscribed if you would like to
comment on youtube in the future that
will be the only way you can do it
so we'll make that change thank you
thank you for that suggestion very
helpful
this is what i was talking about about
i introduced the concept yesterday by
twitter
and i call it collaborative iq
collaborative iq
so this is an example
my intelligence
and my knowledge could not solve that
problem but because this is a
collaborative you know
fluid situation
you solved it for me
so this is a perfect example where my
effective iq is magnified
by the cluster of people who are you
know sort of in my orbit
which is really an amazing thing
i think it's completely under
appreciated
completely
i don't know if it has something to do
with the way that the way i run this you
know it's more
it's more interactive than most things
so it could be that
patreon not youtube
uh oh use a tablet and you can't comment
on well i don't know about that
all right
uh make youtube chat paid
only yeah you're like an entourage
so we haven't heard anything from andrew
taint lately have we
boy the
he is such a good example to teach you
how well you can be disappeared
now i thought alex jones did a good job
because he you know built his own
website and he had
i'm i i think he was just a good
entrepreneur so he could build something
valuable but
if you're just famous for using the
existing social media they can just make
you completely disappear when was last
time you heard of
oh what was his name
i guess that proves the point
milo
yiannopoulos
milo yeah milo yiannopoulos just
literally just disappeared he went for
being one of the most noticeable people
on the planet to just go on
just going
so i guess he's on
he's over there on
rumble
uh oh yeah stefan
all knew you got disappeared bill
mitchell
think of all the people who were
big names during the 2016 cycle
who are gone
it's a lot of people are gone isn't it
that's a lot
um
yeah i think tucker might have been his
last
mainstream media hits
now i told you why i'm still here right
because i'm the one who said republicans
would be haunted
if you say republicans will be haunted
and you become known for that
they have to do you last
i mean i'm not republican but i know i'm
going to get lumped in with that group
am i right
they have to do you last
because if you're the one who says how
they're coming for us and they do you
first you've proven the thesis but if
they do you last they can get rid of all
the people who would say hey he said you
were going to come for him they'd
already be gone
i'm not wrong
i'm not wrong
that does protect me
the fact that i'm famous for saying
they're going to come for us does
protect me
right
you tell me is that yeah that's not
crazy
i protected myself by that prediction
and that was intentional
i was definitely thinking that when i
did it it wasn't the only reason but i
was definitely thinking
rogan said he's getting tired of the
constant attacks that might quit
well he could if he wants to
oh
so joe rogan famously
was talking about all the people who
heard during the lockdowns and when
asked what should people do about it he
said vote republican
now he did it with a big smile on his
face and a cigar
but the point is well made
if you lost your business
because of the lockdown
and you know you're blaming uh you're
blaming democrats for it
vote republican
that is in fact the answer to the thing
so i don't know if it was him saying
he's a republican or he's going to vote
republican he didn't say that
he was just saying it's the answer to
the question which i think is a fair
statement
the answer to the question is what are
you going to do about it well you do
have something to do about it there's
something very specific you can do about
it
and he's speculating that voters might
be in the mood to do something about it
now remember the the thing about
republicans
that the democrats always get wrong
is it feels to me that well maybe it
works both ways in some way but
i think republicans are a little bit
more about action than talk
and so it's a little difficult to
estimate how much action they're going
to apply because they haven't talked
enough to give you full visibility on
the action
and i think that's one of the reasons
that trump won with the
so-called uh you know secret trump
voters
there was a little more action than
there was talk
all right
mike tyson said he's going to vote
republican
where do you see the most energy
gathering right now oh
good question
so i've
often said that you can predict things
by energy
and
there's a weird amount of consistent
energy for the trump world
you really would have thought it would
have died down wouldn't you
but it didn't
so so that's kind of surprising so i
would say that the republicans have a
pent-up energy
that needs to go somewhere
ideally it will go into elections
it might
in some cases
go into some violence so there are crazy
people
but i don't think you have to worry
about their rank and file
now i guess uh
um at the same time swalwell was
complaining about somebody
threatening to bring in assault rifling
biden was giving a speech
is this a coincidence well you decide
about how it's crazy for um citizens to
want to solve rifles because
they can't really protect against the
government and their f-15s as he said
how stupid is that
you know i say this all the time
there will never be
a fight between citizens with ar-15s
and the military with their jets
that nobody thinks that's going to
happen
what's going to happen is if the if the
government says you have to do x
and the public says no we're not
there is not enough military to make us
do it
and
and and the fact is that the the elite
in such a situation would never be able
to go outdoors again
there's not enough military in the world
to protect a president
who would let's say become a dictator
let's say that some president decided to
become a dictator
immediately the citizens would act on
all of their family members
every ally who is unprotected they would
never be able to travel anywhere again
you know
it's never going to be a nuke against a
gun
it's going to be that the citizens will
make the country untravelable
for anybody who is trying to oppress
them
they will make it untravelable you won't
be able to get out of your car
that's that's a pretty good useful
pressure i would say
um
yeah could you imagine a president
ordering the military to fire on
citizens yeah
that i mean
i suppose anything could happen but
all right
um
somebody says their smart well-informed
liberal friend never heard of the
abraham accords and he challenged me to
list some trump accomplishments
now that's i think that works both ways
if he asks for republicans
to mention any abiding accomplishments
they'd say nothing
but he does have a list of legislative
accomplishments that democrats say are
good
critics would say well you didn't get
what you really wanted there's a weak
weak legislation that spends too much
money and really failures
all right
uh
i can't wait to see the strafing runs
with the f-15s yeah
scott are you still sad uh i'm not sad
i am not
um would you like to know why
so i found out what was going on with me
and it turns out
that i had intentionally
intentionally i had changed my mix of
medical marijuana dosing
and i had intentionally
done more indica but i'd also
unintentionally done more than i thought
meaning that i thought i was still doing
a mix of sativa which lifts you up
and
indica which makes you sleepy and if you
did too much of it it could make you sad
over time
and so all i did was switch my mix and
i'm instantly
instantly fixed
no problem at all
you should modulate your pot use two
weeks off two weeks on you know what
would be wrong with that
the two weeks off
i can't i can't do too much sativa
because
it puts you into an anxious
frame of mind eventually you know not on
day one but if you do too much of either
one you get too much of either one
the the only thing that makes sense is
to
to use one in a daytime and one if you
want to go to sleep and that is great
then it's great
you are addicted that is true
but do you think that matters to me let
me list some other things i'm addicted
to
exercise
you got a problem with that
i'm totally addicted to exercise my
entire life i've never been able to go
48 hours without exercising i just can't
do it
right
yeah there are a lot of things i enjoy
that i'm psychologically addicted to
i'm addicted to my dog
even though she's a pain yes
yeah and if if you don't smoke regularly
you get a completely different
experience
so the experience that i get is there's
nothing like
what anybody else would get for me it's
it's more like a change of attitude and
energy
for other people it's a whole
you know they can't function in
society's situation it's completely
different
if you do it all the time
too much of anything is probably bad
except for
money
health
all right
i'd like to uh end on a up note
anybody up for that let's end on an up
note
uh i do this often but i don't think i
can do it often enough
how many of you have
experienced an improvement in your life
because you watch
my content
an improvement in your life beyond just
having some entertainment every day
look at the other comments
now i told you when i
i've been telling you for a while
that the payoff for me is not it's not
really financial
the payoff for me is this that this is
my payoff
and it feels really good
let me tell you
you wish you were sitting where i'm
sitting right now
just just imagine this experience this
is the experience i'm having right now
thanks to you so it's a collaborative
experience i actually have goosebumps
like literally i don't know if you can
see it i have goose bumps right now
look at the comments
so
this is my payoff
my payoff is that i said i would help
you improve your lives in a variety of
ways
and now people are saying yep
yep you did it
that is amazingly satisfying amazingly
satisfying
and
let me offer to you
that if you're not doing something
that someday somebody is going to say
well will you really help me out
maybe you should consider it
because there's almost nothing that
feels this good
right outside of like physical pleasures
in terms of psychological
benefits there's almost nothing that
feels as good as i feel right now
to know that you know i was i jacked
into
civilization
i was part of something
and according to many many people i made
something
you know significantly better for them
you can't you can't beat that that's
just the best feeling in the world
and that requires
a farewell simultaneous sip but only
farewell until
later
and so
this is a thank you to all of you
because uh i'm glad glad that that could
be helpful
but you have no idea how much you helped
me
you have no idea how much you helped me
it's a lot thank you
and on that happy note
so low on youtube i'm going to talk to
the locals people for a little bit more
