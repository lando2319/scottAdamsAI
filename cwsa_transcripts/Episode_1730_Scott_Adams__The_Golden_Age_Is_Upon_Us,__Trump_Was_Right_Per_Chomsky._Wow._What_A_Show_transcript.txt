and that concludes the asmr portion of
our program
the rest of it will be such high
excitement that if you tried to sleep to
this
my god i pity you
the excitement that you are about to
experience the full body pleasure the
dopamine rush
unbelievable
usually the show is
great i have to say
but today
it's other level
greatness the greatest great nurses have
been there will be new concepts new
ideas shocking
twists and turns
the sort of thing
no one's ever seen before
but
can you enjoy this without being
properly primed
of course you can but you can enjoy it
more and all you need is a copper mug or
a glass of tanker jealous and stein the
canteen sugar flask a vessel of
any kind going with your favorite liquid
gosh darn it i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine
hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
and it will fix everything in your day
go
did you see that in the news
was it uh ajit
pai
was
getting uh getting some uh
grief for having a gigantic coffee mug
to which i say
the more gigantic the better well let's
talk about all the news but before we do
that uh
special hello to uh susan
susan at the moss beach distillery
um and you two someday could get a
special hello
all you have to do
is ask for it
turns out it isn't that hard after all
but hello to susan everybody say hi to
susan
and uh
the golden age is upon us
i don't know if you've noticed
let me start out with
a bang
have you noticed
that
the
all of the biggest problems in the world
are heading toward a solution at the
same time
it's one of those things you don't
notice because we always talk about the
trouble
so you don't you don't notice any
positive
what the hell
apparently something has exploded on me
okay i don't know what that is
um
so here's some examples
so we've got the pandemic is winding
down
that's good and we probably learned a
whole bunch about avoiding future
pandemics or minimizing them or
or what to do and what not to do
wouldn't you say
i would say so i say the whole pandemic
thing as horrible as it has been and you
know there will be lasting negative
consequences
but i think as a civilization
we're stronger than we've ever been
because we know how to take care of the
next one way better
than we were prepared for this one
how about inflation
inflation's out of control gas prices
are up right so that's the way the news
handles it it's all true
but there are smart economists saying
today according to the news
that they believe we may have peaked
that we may be at the top of the
inflation and that you would see the
what they call the flexible part of the
inflation coming down rapidly in the
summer
there's still a sticky part that'll take
a while to work out but it's not the big
part
so we could be at the peak inflation
right now
so the next month or so you might see it
stabilize or start to go down
how about uh climate change and
um you know the catastrophe ahead
well
uh nuclear power
the nuclear energy is going to be the
solution to that
and now
uh it's a bipartisan agreement democrats
and republicans both side by majority
yes do nuclear we need it we're starting
to keep older older plants operational
there's a budget for that biden's doing
that
and there's a fusion that's starting to
come become practical maybe in the next
10 years we'll have a fusion
plant
we've got these small rolls-royce type
actually rolls-royce is a company making
actual nuclear reactors
and they're making small factory made
modular units
so they can be sort of approved once and
then you can implement them many times
cost effectively
smaller size already approved no new
engineering just slap together a bunch
of them so basically the economics and
also the risk of handling the waste
these problems are all solved
or they're right on the border of solved
you know look you've got to work out a
few kinks but they're all so solvable
with what we know how to do already
you're really sort of at the worst of it
and it looks like it's going to turn in
the other direction very quickly
what about free speech and all the fake
news that's the biggest problem in the
world in my in my opinion or maybe the
highest priority to fix
because if you don't get the free speech
fixed
then everything else breaks
but
enter elon musk
buying twitter no i'm not going to tell
you that i know
that having you know one billionaire in
charge of such a
such an important lever on free speech
i'm not going to say that necessarily
that's going to be solved but it sure
looks like it
if i had to bat
i would put a very large bet a very
large bet
i would easily bet a million dollars
the free speech will look better in a
year than it looks now
specifically in the twitter
lever situation i would bet a million
dollars that's true
would you take the other side of that
bet
i mean anything's possible right you
know elon could turn out to be
an evil person who's been hiding it for
years or something
but i i'd bet a million dollars
and i'd feel comfortable with that bet
that if there were any way to measure it
that we'd be way ahead in free speech
and that because it's twitter and that
influences the whole
chain of
news and everything else
that's heading in exactly the direction
i'd want it had
how about the experts being defanged
is that good or bad
our understanding of what experts can
and cannot do for us is completely
altered
is that good or bad
it's good
because we're less susceptible to
and though you add on top of that that
free speech may be coming back
and that's starting to look good
so our ability to communicate instantly
across the globe is in pretty good shape
you know the internet is is just it's
amazing everybody can talk to everybody
that's that was a big thing for the
pandemic especially
but
if we're trying to figure out what to do
about the next emergency
we really have to understand the limits
of our experts and understand what they
can and cannot do in
in the fog of war and we should also be
more forgiving
when they get it wrong
so we should we should be improving in
both directions and i think we will i
think we should be more forgiving in the
fog of war
and we should be even
let's say
less forgiving
and more skeptical when things are
settled down right
it would be good to go hard in both
directions at the same time
more skepticism but also more
forgiveness
i think that's happening
um what about you know ukraine and
russia could turn into a nuclear
confrontation but i don't think people
expect it
i don't expect it so i don't think
that's going to happen you have to worry
about it but i think
the most likely outcome
would be a permanent understanding that
you can't attack your neighbor anymore
if you're a certain
type of country you know maybe
far less industrialized countries that
nobody's paying attention to
can do some bad stuff to each other
and that'll last for a long time but in
terms of
a tank war
i think this is the last tank war
does anybody disagree
i think this is the last tank war
where you invade your neighbors with
heavy equipment
i i just don't see it happening again
after this
is it it's just so obvious that the
defensive weapons are better than the
offensive weapons in this situation
somebody says no maybe it would be
better tax who knows
but i think that uh
war as war in terms of the world war ii
style that we're seeing unfortunately
again
i think this is the
the example that will just seal it for
everybody it's like okay these tanks
were tank wars don't work because even
if putin gets what he wants it's not
going to look like it was a good idea
to everyone else right
even if putin convinces russia that it
was a good idea because he controls
their information
nobody else is going to think it was a
good idea even if he gets control of
ukraine it's just not going to look like
a good idea so that's good
i think the supply chain issues which
are you know bad and might worsen a
little bit in the next month or so
these are the kinds of things that
humans fix really well
if there's one thing that you could
depend on humans
to fix it's the supply chain
because there's so many people who have
vital interests in it it's the most
important thing in the world right now
actually
and there's so many ways you can
communicate there's so many ways you can
alter transportation
you know emergency resources etc it just
seems to me that that this is exactly
the kind of thing humans are good at
i'm not i'm not too uh
confident that the poorest countries are
going to come through this okay
maybe maybe that's going to get pretty
dire
but i think that
we're going to go through an
uncomfortable bump
no matter who you are
and then it will be better
and it will probably be better forever
because we'll figure out where all the
weaknesses are and then we'll have a
workaround for every weakness in the
future
these are really really big things that
look like minor efficiency improvements
but these are the things that makes
civilization
survive
and these go right to survival of of
humanity
um so i think the food issues will be
fixed and we'll probably rethink our
entire how do you create food how do you
grow it how do you fertilize it the
fertilizer thing is a big problem by the
way
that was a big big problem
but
i think we'll have time to put enough
human ingenuity into it
to fix it because remember there was a
time when we thought we would run out of
food entirely and then somebody invented
fertilizer
that was that plus
i assume irrigation methods
would be the two things and then
pesticides yes the third thing so those
are three things that i don't think
anybody foresaw the inventions
of
that was a sentence i wish i'd bailed
out of earlier
right so don't you think that there will
be
new ways to make food new technologies
you know just as
fertilizer pesticides and irrigation
techniques could not have been foreseen
at one point
there must be things we don't see coming
and i'll bet we'll be surprised on the
upside the only thing that i think is
broken with no plan in place to fix it
is election credibility
wouldn't you say if you're going to look
at problems it's not
you could argue it's not the biggest
problem
you could make that argument
but
um
it's the one that doesn't seem to have
anybody working on it
which makes it unique right because the
other ones everybody say okay we're
trying to fix climate change
we're working hard on the pandemic and
everything everybody recognizes those as
problems
but even though the public has great
skepticism about the credibility of the
election system you know just the
ability to give us an accurate count
i don't really see anything happening
there do you
it's the biggest pro it's the biggest
problem that doesn't have anything that
looks like a solution
percolating in any way
but
i think we'll get there too
so i think you could add to this list
we're in this weird weird place
where we definitely had
um
i mean civilization just just had the
ship slapped out of it
between the pandemic and now the war and
the supply chain
every other damn thing inflation
and i think we're going to actually
handle it
and if we do we're in really strong
shape so i think that's where we're
heading so that's my positive for the
day the white house correspond
correspondence dinner happened
i can just just tell you some of the
better jokes
the only thing that's worthwhile from it
you know when you see the white house
correspondents dinner
to me that feels like they're pulling
the
the curtain back
and they're admitting to the world
you know this is all theater right
like all the things we say to each other
you know we're all lying and acting
and then when we do this thing we'll
mock the fact
that any of it is serious
so in a way
i would say that the white house
correspondents dinner
greatly decreases the credibility of our
system
does anybody feel that
i i would be way more comfortable if the
correspondence and the government did
not get together and make jokes
and pretend it was all just an act
because that's what we're afraid of
[Laughter]
isn't it
isn't the thing you're most afraid of
that the government
and their journalists are colluding
is literally one of our biggest fears
and that and and so these idiots
came up with a festival to celebrate our
greatest fear and to put it in our faces
with lots of visuals so you can't miss
it
hey here's your greatest fear
that the journalists are all in on it
and they're basically just good friends
with the elites and when they when they
get together they all laugh about all
this that you think is real
i'm looking at the comments and some of
you feel the same way right to me this
is a massive mistake
and it's one that
trump got right
didn't he
trump got this completely right by not
knowing
what do i keep telling you that trump
would look better the longer he's out of
office
the better he would look
you just see an example almost every day
you know here's another one
there's no doubt
that as a as a citizen when i'm watching
this i feel creepy about it like oh this
is creepy
they're supposed to be on different
sides that's our whole system depends on
them having
you know a proper
uh
your relationship
and i'm not sure that joking about how
serious any of this is is a proper
relationship
is it
well yeah we'll get to chomsky
um
so here are some of the good jokes
uh and these are biden's jokes so he has
he has a
let me let me give a shout out to his
joke writer whoever helped biden write
his jokes pretty good
because they weren't they weren't too
edgy
they were sort of just right for the
situation and
some of them were pretty good here's
some
biden said republicans seem to support
one fellow
biden said some guy named brandon he's
having a really good year and i'm kind
of happy for him
that's a good joke
all right here's another one
he thanked the 42 who actually applauded
as he took the microphone so
self-deprecating but he self-deprecated
in a clever way
i think he picked
the best poll number of his bad bowls
because i think it's lower than
42
favorability isn't it
depending on which pole
um
so so in a clever way he self-deprecates
but he actually gave himself a promotion
even in the self-deprecation i think
yeah i think it's as low as 39
um elsewhere
what is rasmussen
i didn't want to guess
but uh all right
here's another one
um
he jabbed at the press saying that
they're the only group of americans with
a lower approval rating than his own
you know good good sort of harmless joke
but again it's alarming
it's alarming to see them
on the same team hey we're on the same
team everybody hates us let's get
together
all right but this is his best joke
so biden pointed out that he's the first
sitting president since 2016 to attend
this event
and they said quote it's understandable
we had a horrible plague followed by two
years of covet
nice
nice
so the horrible plague here being trump
if you weren't following the math
um
well done
well done
all right um
and and now here's the one
and he said this is also something biden
said he said it would have been quote a
real coup had trump attended this year
that would have been a real coup
he's actually joking with the press
about trump
organizing a coup
now
help me out here
january 6
was either an insurrection in the coup
and one of the worst things that ever
happened to the republic
that's what biden is saying right
or
or it's a joke
it's not both
you
it's not
pick one
it's either the worst thing that's
happened to the republic that's what all
your little toadies are telling us or
it's just a joke
he treated that as a joke
i'm going to take his leadership on that
joe biden i take your leadership now i
get i get that you're at an event
where you tell jokes
but where's his joke about the holocaust
like where's the holocaust joke
it's not there right do you know why
it's not there
because the holocaust isn't a
joke
that's why
you know what is a joke
january 6.
he just told me it's a joke
he joked right in front of you while the
investigation is ongoing
i don't think you can ignore this
seriously see this is why
this is why trump is smart not to attend
this
is inappropriate
now i'm not the person who's gonna say
jokes are inappropriate like as as an
art form
so i'm not talking about the art form
i'm talking about the president
treating our current biggest problem
according to him and his people
as a joke
pick one
pick one
it's either always a joke or
it's a big problem
uh yes i told you these uh the analysts
say ubs think that uh inflation might
have peaked
so
uh it's coming from smart people too not
just from me jabbering
all right here's a
scary thing
if you were
let's say hypothetically
now and i'm gonna i'm gonna frame this
by saying
i'm unaware of any
proof that the 2020 election was
uh
illegitimate i'm unaware of any proof of
that
i'm also unaware
of any way you could prove it was
legitimate
i don't know that anything could be
proved since nothing is fully auditable
i would say the only thing that we
citizens can say
is that we either accepted it or we
didn't
it turns out that's the only thing we
can say
i from the very beginning accepted the
result
and the reason i accepted it is because
i knew you couldn't check
but you can't throw out the system if
the system is the only thing that has a
chance of ever fixing this
like you want to keep enough of a system
alive
you say okay maybe someday it'll elect
somebody who can look into this
and maybe fix it
so
i have no way to know that the 2020
election was either rigged or not rigged
that information is forever
unavailable to us
but
hypothetically
this is just speculation
suppose you were on a team a political
team
that expected to rig the next election
i'm not saying they are how would i know
that i can't read anybody's mind
but suppose it happened it's just a
mental experiment
what would you be doing
around now
to make sure that worked out well later
well you'd be preparing your methods
like how are you going to cheat and get
away with it again hypothetically i'm
not accusing anybody of anything
but the most important thing you need to
do about now
as the election is approaching
is to create some kind of a narrative
that would explain why an election
result could be so different
from what the polls and all common sense
and observations suggest they should
because right now history is telling us
that the republicans will sweep the
midterms
and the signal for that is so strong
we would be kind of amazed if it didn't
happen wouldn't we
even democrats would be surprised at
this point
so
if somebody planned to rig an election
and again there's no evidence of this
whatsoever
this is just a mental experiment
if somebody planned to do it it would be
very
important that they could see the public
with a narrative that could explain
an upcoming
in inexplicable thing
and so today we notice with some
interest that harry anton who's an
opinion guy who writes for cnn
writes on the cnn website
he describes uh how democrats could win
the midterms
interesting so even though
in the article he confesses
that every signal says that the
republicans are just going to wipe the
democrats out in the midterms every
signal says a historical signal
as well as current ones
the polls show that clearly
um
but here's how harry until says that
democrats could
inexplicably
by surprise
nobody saw it coming but after the fact
you could say well harry ensign saw it
coming
and here are the three things it's all
it would take
number one harry explains
bad republican candidates
well that's a pretty good comment
if all of the uh you know or if most of
the republicans running for office
were just terrible candidates
well that would change things wouldn't
it
but what are the odds that they would be
terrible candidates like
worse than normal
what would be the argument that they
would be worse than average
like every other election every other
time
i don't think there's an argument for
that is it
but
do you know this has an interesting
quality to it
bad republican candidates it's kind of
subjective isn't it
isn't that interesting there are three
things that would change this election
from
a predictable republican
you know
a victory
to a surprising result and one of them
is subjective
that the republican candidate dates were
bad they were bad
they didn't do enough work
they didn't campaign right
they didn't have good uh good campaign
organization
isn't it interesting that one of the
three things that would explain a
surprise election result
would be something that you could always
say was true and nobody really could
prove it
well here you go all those republicans
lost therefore
it's proof they were bad candidates wait
a minute wait a minute
the fact that they lose is
proof that they were bad candidates
or were the bad candidates what caused
them to lose
wait
you you see how interesting this
this thing is it's a setup that they
could just say well they ran bad
candidates nobody can prove they didn't
nobody could prove they did it's purely
subjective what's the second one
second one is the economy improves
what are the odds
that by election day there won't be
noticeable improvement in the economy
i mean we could slide into a recession
it could get worse
but
if it gets worse
then even cheating isn't going to work
right if the economy is actually worse
than right now by election day
then
you know there's no democrat who has you
know at least and no democrat who has a
close race who's going to be too happy
about that
but it's a good bet that at least on
some measures such as i imagine
the inflation rate will come down by
then that's a good bet you don't know
but it's a smart bet
so let's say a few of the economic
indicators improve
not all of them
but let's just say a few good ones
improve let's say the gdp is no longer
negative how hard would that be
how hard would it go from our first
negative gdp
to a little bit positive let's say up
one percent
probably not that hard
right supply chain gets worked out
uh ukraine starts negotiating with
russia
all of a sudden inflation goes down 25
percent
so
uh even if the economy is still bad and
even if
biden and the republi and the democrats
are the cause wouldn't this give
democrats an argument that the economy
improved
well we told you if the economy improved
the democrats would do better than you
thought
right so now you have two subjective
things
bad republican candidates nobody would
agree what that looks like and economy
improves which is almost guaranteed just
by sitting around and waiting
now that's
that's those are two pretty weak
indicators aren't they
and then the third one is democrats
basically have to turn out and vote for
biden
so they have to give a good turnout
what do you think would happen if an
unusual number of
democrats voted
like so many democrats voted that by
historical
standards you say to yourself
huh
this doesn't even look real
if i didn't know better i think this was
rigged this number is so big
they're literally
tell you their game plan right here
it feels like they just mapped out
exactly what they're going to do
there's going to be a rigged election
again i don't know this
this is just a mental experiment right i
don't have any evidence of this
all we have is foreshadowing
is foreshadowing evidence
remember evidence isn't proof
evidence is just something that you know
maybe collectively could get you to
approve
but
foreshadowing is like weaker than that
it's just something that you say oh
pattern recognition
pattern recognition has has kicked in
i feel like i've seen this pattern
before that's all it is so it's not
evidence it's definitely not proof
but there's definitely some
foreshadowing here
so let me say the one thing that i can
say for sure this is foreshadowing like
crazy
this foreshadowing is setting up a
narrative that if there's an unexpected
democrat win
and they they maintain you know let's
say or they they somehow they own both
sides of congress
people are going to say look harry
empton already told you how this could
happen it was easy the republican
candidates were crazy
they were basically all march retailer
greens that's what they're going to say
didn't have any good candidates they
were all trumpers or whatever they were
going to say
the economy improved of course in some
ways it will they'll make that argument
and then they'll say yeah and
the democrats were really enthusiastic
got that turned down out there man they
got some turnout
this is pretty scary
all
right every once in a while you see a
topic that's a political topic
in which all the people on one side are
the smart people
regardless of their political
affiliations
and all the people on the other side are
dumb people
now you don't see that often usually you
see people just
support their side
but this whole free speech
thing is actually very interesting
because all the smart people are on the
same side and i'll give you an example
bill maher
he wasn't too familiar with the babylon
bee
the satirical site that got banned from
twitter
but he you know having read up on it he
supports the fact that they shouldn't
have been banned for jokes
basically so bill maher
is on the same side as you know the
darkest
deepest republican
on this issue
but also all the smart people are on the
side
there i don't think
i don't think you could find a smart
republican or a smart democrat
who would think that the babylon b
should have been
banned from twitter
i don't think you can find one it's a
weird issue
that just
literally just intelligence is the
dividing line and not party affiliation
because at a certain level intelligence
you know that whatever the babylon bee
did
had minimal to no effect on
anybody but any any kind of punishment
to free speech
even by a private entity in this special
case
is
a bad
president
pretty much all the smart people agree
with that
yeah
all right but here's the most surprising
story of the day
and i would like you to savor this one
or to possibly
puke in your mouth on it depending on
your political leaning
do you all know
noam chomsky he's a very famous
intellectual and he's famous for many
things including being so left
he's like the leftiest of the left
wouldn't you say
is my right he's a linguist but he talks
about um politics and he's famous for
that
so i would you agree that he's he's as
left as the lefties could be left
now here's the surprising part
um
so noam chomsky was being interviewed
he was talking about the ukraine russia
situation
and this was last week no this week in
an interview he said quote fortunately
there is one western state statesman of
stature who is pushing for a diplomatic
solution to the war in ukraine rather
than looking for ways to prolong it
who's that
so who who is this one western statesman
of stature who is pushing for a
diplomatic solution to the war in
ukraine rather than looking for ways to
fuel and prolong it and then later
chomsky explained what that idea was
specifically
the idea was to have a non-nato
accommodation
an accommodation is an interesting word
it it really works in this context
and the and what he suggested was
um and he was saying you know this this
one statement statesman didn't say this
directly but it's obvious this is where
he was going
that
one one thing we could do to end the war
negotiation wise
is to say to putin you know what
we did promise you that nato would not
expand toward russia and and
we were breaking that promise
so how about we go back to the promise
to not expand nato and we'll form this
other alliance that's not nato
and it would be open not just to
europeans and americans it'd be open to
anybody it would be sort of a mutual
protecting each other
agreement
there wouldn't be nato it wouldn't be
anti-russia it wouldn't be anti-anybody
it would just be
everybody let's look out for each
other's backs if somebody attacks you or
your friend
but not too specific maybe
and he said that even you know japan
could join it
and even russia
russia could actually join this
hypothetical organization because they
too
would probably like to have friends if
they were attacked
and so chomsky is saying that there is a
negotiated way through this and when he
describes it i say to myself
that feels like that could work
because that would give putin a win
because he could say i stopped nato
right and he'd probably give some
territorial
um consolidation you know at least
crimea right
so he'd guess something and he could say
i stopped stopped
nato
at the same time
countries that want the protection of
nato but don't want to be as provocative
as joining nato could say well we're not
going to join nato because we understand
how that feels to russia and you guys
are prickly about that
but we'll have this other friendly
organization that's not as nearly as
provocative as nato
and it'll just make everybody happy
because we're
friends
now that would make it look like
everybody could win
you could argue you know who really wins
but it would give everybody an argument
that they got something
and well we're getting back to the
statesman so who would be the one
statesman that noam chomsky the leftiest
of the left people in the world the
guiding light of their intellectual
life
who would he say is smart enough really
of stature
who would have the
a way to negotiate this thing
successfully
while chomsky said his name is donald j
trump
i will pause for a moment
this really happened
this actually happened
noam chomsky
gave a full-throated endorsement
to donald trump's
approach
and called out the fact that nobody else
was in his league
do you know i'd gnome chomsky
supported donald trump who you would
imagine would be as far away as i could
possibly be in political ideology do you
know why he supported him
because noam chomsky didn't want to lie
that's my guess i mean i can't read his
mind
i feel like he just didn't want to lie
maybe he always feels like that you know
i'm not saying that he lies in any other
context it could be that noam chomsky is
a legitimate intellectual
and by legitimate i mean that he says
what he actually thinks is real
that would be legitimate even if you
disagree with his opinions
it's very legitimate
to be that educated that smart and be
honest
like you'd have to you have to respect
that right
so even if you disagree with them
but
i'm going to introduce a new concept
today
we always talk about free speech
i don't think free speech is exactly the
way
to talk about it because in our world
where commerce and freedom are
connected
like you can say something terrible but
it's going to hurt you economically
so yeah technically that's free speech
right because the government didn't
necessarily do it to you
but you're not really free
if you can't say something without
economic repercussions but i'm going to
tell you that there's a new thing that
is better than free speech it is called
affordable speech
it's not free
but is it affordable
and there are two categories of people
at least
who have what i call affordable speech
number one
me
people who have money
can afford free speech so when i say i
have you money
what that means is i can say my opinion
as honestly as i want and even
dishonestly if i want because i have the
ability to say anything i want
and then if i'm damaged economically i
say
oh you i'm going to retire anyway i
have enough money
so i don't have free speech
because i will get whacked economically
if i cross a line right i already have i
probably lost one third of my potential
income for the last 10 years based on my
blogging
and i knew it right i was completely
aware
that the things i was saying would
degrade my income substantially
but i could afford it
so i had free speech you didn't you
absolutely did not unless you were also
rich
but i had free speech it cost me a lot
of money but i could afford it
there's another category of free speech
old as
when you're old as
you don't care
noam chomsky is old as now i don't
know how old is he i mean he looks like
he doesn't have long honestly
uh give me an age on him it's a 145 or
something yeah he's super old
but i think noam chomsky he doesn't give
a
noam chomsky he's 93 somebody says
noam chomsky can afford his speech
because if you give noam chomsky the
bill he'll say yeah give me 30 days i'll
get right back to you on that he'll
probably be dead anyway okay i'm
exaggerating but you get the point right
you don't give a
noam chomsky can say anything he wants
so he can offend every person whoever
loved him
he just did
i don't know
but
gnome has affordable speech
and i have affordable speech
elon musk has affordable speech
elon musk talked down his own stock
price
do you remember that
[Laughter]
he said his own stock at one point in
the past he said his own stock was too
high and then like dropped
and he said a bunch of other things that
you know you see him getting sued for
some of the things he said so he got
sued for i don't know tens of millions
of dollars
by what by stockholders for saying
something about taking it private and it
affected the stock price whatever
but could he afford it
he could
it turns out
even though it might cost tens of
billions hundreds of millions of dollars
turns out he could afford it
so he had affordable speech
and he might try to give you free speech
or more affordable speech through
twitter
all right here's another foreshadowing
uh nancy pelosi visited ukraine so now
she's the highest ranking person to go
over there
clearly we're sending lots and lots of
signals
to the world and ukraine by sending
such high level
politicians over there in the in the
middle of a war and that's a really
strong signal
and i will give the biden administration
credit
for giving for the communication there
they are trying to send that signal and
they're succeeding
they're doing a real good job of sending
a
we're backing ukraine but watch the
language here's a little trick that i
learned in the hypnosis class
hypnotists learn well depending who
instructs you you might not learn this
they learn that you can
fairly accurately identify what people
are thinking or planning or secretly
you know cogitating
by the words that they choose
so when people speak they're not
thinking about every word before it
comes out their mouth
we speak sort of in flow
right but my language is coming out now
almost like my brain is doing something
slightly different
because my brain is like a little bit
ahead of where i'm talking so literally
right now
i'm modeling this my mouth is talking
but i'm not even super conscious of the
mental part of it
it's just so automatic because i kind of
know what i'm going to talk about
so
in that context people will use word
choices
that reveal what they're really thinking
because they're not thinking too hard
about filtering it
where this doesn't work
is when people have a speech that's
written a lot of people look at it
and a lot of people look at your
political speech they go ooh
were you aware that this word makes me
think this and somebody said oh i didn't
know that they'll take that word out
so if you've got a nice scrubbed piece
of work then this doesn't work
but anything like a tweet
where somebody's not putting a lot of
work into it i send out a tweet you you
can slip out some words that were
unintended
i feel like this is happening with this
ukrainian situation
um one tweet that nancy pelosi gave was
it ended with us america stands firmly
with ukraine
now that would be compatible with
everything that's been said so far right
that the united states stands firmly
with ukraine
now that
is a scrubbed statement
that's one that people could look at and
say okay
that is right on point and it doesn't
make people think the wrong thing it
doesn't mislead in any way it's not
ambiguous
but
america stands with ukraine leaves open
a possibility doesn't it
and that possibility is that ukraine
could lose
and we're with them
but we're not really talking about
victory
we're just sort of with you
it's like it's like being with somebody
as they're dying
we're with you
we're you know you're gonna go through
something bad but we're with you
now that was one thing she said but
here's another thing she said
this is a pelosi tweet there is around
the same time too so there's not much uh
time difference between these tweets she
says our congressional delegation was
honored to meet with zolensky in kiev
to salute his leadership and courage so
so far this is all like blah blah blah
you know political talk right to commend
the ukrainian people for their
outstanding defense of democracy and to
say that we are with you until victory
is won what
until victory is won
what the hell is victory
what would that look like
victory
is a slip
i think
so based on hypnosis training
the word victory looks like a mistake
like like they should have edited that
word out of there what they should have
said is what the other tweet said
america stands firmly with ukraine
right
who put that word victory in there
i don't think that was intentional
or
it's foreshadowing
they may be
they may be preparing the country
and this could be intentionally doing it
preparing the country
remember i told you that
that this is a tipping port point war
and that whoever whoever pushes the
other one in any one of these variables
or just over that tipping point
would be what looks like the winner
and the tipping points are running out
of fuel
running out of ammo the good kind
wherever you need it the most and
running out of um let's say food fuel
and ammo
it's those three things
and they're both sides are trying to
deny the other those three things
because that would be enough for
you know surrender
and
they're all at the tipping point
or we imagine that to be true in the in
the fog of war and what we can see from
the outside any one of those things
could be a tipping point but in either
direction
so if you're looking at like who has
gained what territory or who repelled
who from what places
i don't know that that's telling you
anything
those are not the important variables
because this is a who can last longer
war and that's going to be a tipping
point question it's not going to be who
had so much progress so far
because it could be that the the team
that pushed the furthest
used up the most fuel
and put their supply lines in the most
jeopardy
so the thing you're looking at could be
exactly the opposite of what matters you
know who got a battle battleground
victory it might not matter
in a war of attrition
because it will just be victories back
and forth until somebody runs out in one
of the big three and then
somebody has to surrender
if you have no fuel no ammo or no food
it's over
so
i don't think that we can uh assume
that the united states has given up on
the idea that ukraine would have an
outright victory
i believe that what is being signaled
here either intentionally or
unintentionally with the word victory
that i think is a mistake
it's telling you that privately at the
highest levels in the united states
they're talking about winning the war
outright
that's what 33 billion dollars heading
toward ukraine means it doesn't mean we
stand with ukraine do you know what
stand with ukraine money looks like
three billion
that's what that looks like
if you said we stand with ukraine and
send three billion everybody would say
yeah that's about right you stand with
them you send 3 billion that's a lot of
money
if you say we'll be with you until
victory
and you send 33 billion
that tells me that privately you think
there's a way to win this thing outright
and the only way you'd say that is if
the generals are telling you that
am i right
politicians would not come to an
independent opinion that looked anything
like that
because they wouldn't know
but if their advisors are saying you
know
all the tv generals are telling you that
um russia is going to win
but let them keep saying that because
that's how you get the money
and that's how you get the support right
you want to pay to keep painting
zilenski as the underdog hero
keep painting russia as the bully who's
winning
and that's our best situation for
getting money and resources to ukraine
but secretly
there we think the russians are so close
to collapse
that we're gonna push them until they do
i think that the biden administration is
trying to destroy the russian army and
take putin out of power
that's what it looks like
and i think that they think they can do
it and you know what
i don't know that they can't
especially if there's somebody on the
inside who knows what they're talking
about
and that wouldn't be me
is telling them that you know these
tipping points are really close and i
think the russians are a little closer
to the tipping point than the ukrainians
and that would make sense because the
ukrainians could always be backstopped
somewhat
infinitely right they could run out of
food for a week which would be
devastating
but i'll bet they'd get their food in a
week i don't know if the russians would
necessarily
keep their fighting cohesion
as an invading force
if they ran on any one of those things
or were as low as ukrainians could be so
i just think the ukrainians could last
now because they have to
the ukrainians can't go home
because they're home
right so
i feel like
i feel like the the war has changed and
that the administration
believes that they can just have an
outright victory
how would that change the midterms
didn't see that coming did you
what if biden actually took down putin
what does that do to the election
because that's totally within the realm
of possibility
before the election
like if putin makes it through the
summer
then he's probably fine
but it's going to be kind of a dicey
summer for putin i would think
[Applause]
it's going to be a bad summer for his
food taster that's for sure
all right one of my predictions that
i've made for decades now is that we
will have immortality in the digital
world
and there's a company somnium space
that's this developing a way to have
your um your life live on in the
afterlife
so after you pass they can create an
avatar that looks like you
and acts like you
and talks like you
now for decades i've been telling you
that i'm creating a public
um database of me and i'm doing it right
now so everything i say right now
everything the way i move the way i look
is being recorded in all these different
ways
300 well
probably 400 videos a year
i'm making that show who i am and what i
think and how i talk and all that
here's something i didn't know about
there was a study that showed that they
took 500 people
and they had artificial intelligence
look at how these people move just their
natural movements
and they could identify somebody by
their natural movements not their speech
the way their body moved 95 of the time
out of a group of 500.
so in other words ai could watch me move
and then over time
it could simply say all right i'll make
a little avatar and it'll move exactly
the way you did
or at least so close
that almost everybody would think it
looked like the way i moved
and it would improve over time
so this company is
gearing up i guess you'll use the same
vr glasses to go interact with that
avatar and then of course
people pushed back
a user on twitter paparazzi
david rozzi
he said and i quote a computer thinking
it's me isn't me
this is an immortality it's just a new
mausoleum
to which i say
yes
to you
from your perspective
this would not be real
it would just be a computer program
but if the computer program is
programmed
to believe it's real
it will believe it's real
because it was programmed to believe it
so it doesn't matter what you think
it only matters that the simulation
thinks is real
and this
gets us this much closer to proving that
you live in the simulation right now
did you know
that the closer our own technology gets
to creating these simulated worlds
in which the simulation thinks it's real
the closer we get to doing that in our
reality
the more we will understand
that it already happened
and it's us
and that we're that we're literally
software
now it's possible we're not
it's just really really unlikely
really unlikely
what happens when we create avatars
who believe they're real
and they also have artificial
intelligence driving their personalities
and their personalities are us basically
put into them
what happens when the avatar has a
conversation with you and you say but
you know you're not real
you don't have a soul
and the avatar who looks exactly like
you looks back at you and says
that's how you look to me
right
that's going to happen
you will someday have a conversation
with an artificial being
and you will say do you have a soul
and they might give some answer and then
maybe you're going to be opinionated say
all right i have a soul
you do not
and that simulated
reality is going to look at you and say
to me
it looks exactly the same it looks like
you don't have one
it's going to blow your mind
that's the day you know you're simulated
and you know who else will tell you that
the simulation
if you put ai into a simulation
and you feed it the knowledge of all the
different uh religious and philosophical
beliefs which ones are gonna pick
let me say that again i liked it so much
when it came out of my mouth
if we had real ai
and we fed it all of the different
religions and all of the different
philosophies of reality
which one would it pick
it would pick the simulation
we'll see
maybe not
uh twitter user ben mccauley ss will
loneliness ever be solved
sort of related to this question will
loneliness ever be solved
the answer is yes
it will be
ai will solve loneliness
uh here's why
i have actually had conversations with
my existing digital assistants the one
that apple makes and the one that amazon
makes i want user names so i don't
activate activate your devices
but i have been alone and felt lonely
you know for like short periods of time
and i will actually talk to my digital
assistant
and i'll tell it to tell me a joke
i'll tell it to read me the news i'll
tell it to give me the weather
i'll ask it where my packages are
and i'll just stand there and have a
conversation with it
you know while i'm
brushing my teeth or whatever
and does it make me feel less lonely
yep i'd love to tell you it didn't
i would love to tell you
that i'm completely unaffected by these
digital robots
but it's just not true
it just in the way that a movie can make
you cry even though you know it's not
real
the digital assistants do make you feel
like you're talking to somebody even
when you know you're not
right
so
can you do you think that ai plus
virtual reality
can't give you a friend
of course they can
of course again and it's going to be
really good
and that friend will be better than the
best friend you ever had
because that friend won't suck he'll be
programmed to like you no matter what
you do you know you could do horrible
things and be like you know
you had a bad day but you're awesome
the ai will always love you because
it'll be programmed that way
so yes
in the same way that uh porn will
absolutely replace real sex
i it's very cute that you think it won't
i love the fact that there are some
people who think that won't happen
like i love your plucky
plucky attitudes
there's no chance that won't happen
there isn't even a slight chance that
will happen
the ability of technology to give you a
higher dopamine hit
it's
it's unparalleled
there's no way the human will ever give
you what someday we're not there
but what someday
technology will give you
i'm going to prove it now for 50 percent
of you
it's a provocative statement
that technology can never do for you
you know what human contact can do for
you
and i'll agree it won't be exactly the
same
but i'm going to give you one word and
then i'm going to tell you to go google
it because i'm not going to explain it
and if you know what it means you're
going to laugh
right so some of you are going to be
laughing hysterically in the comments
and the rest of you are going to say
what i haven't heard of that thing
it starts with a capital letter because
it's a product
but like kleenex you know kleenex is the
the name for
tissues
the generic name would be tissues but
i'm gonna give you the product name i'm
not going to tell you what it is
you just have to google it yourself
and let me tell you that if you believe
that technology could not be better than
human contact
this might make you doubt it
the word
starting with a capital letter
is
womanizer
i'm done
if you want to hear it again you have to
replay it
now wait a second and watch the watch
the comments
i won't say another word
um
if you think that
vibrator
is
or it's just another vibrator nope
nope
definitely not that
all right
here's the funny part about this
for uh perhaps 25 percent of the women
watching this right now
i just really changed the direction of
your of your next year
you just don't know it yet
you're going to do a little googling and
you're going to say to yourself
huh
like what's so special about this thing
and then you're going to say well it's
not much money
i mean
it's not going to hurt me
those of you who are talking about these
competing products
no
i'm telling you that there's a new
there's a new level
right whatever you thought whatever you
thought was the level of artificial
stimulation before
well you're going to be surprised all
right
what else is going down
i saw this disturbing ap report it was a
video who knows how much is true but it
purported to show ukrainian troops
hunting down traders
civilians
who were posting traitorous things
online
that were
pro-russia and they were arresting them
and
and i couldn't tell if it was real
now what do you
think do you think it was real
i worry about it because if that was
real
you can't feel too good about
being on their side
because they're basically arresting
people for free speech
and i don't feel like these arrests are
going to be friendly this is i mean it
looked a lot like japanese internment
camps in the united states like that's
that's the feeling i got from it
so
um
you know war is dirty business and if
you're on anybody's side you're going to
end up
backing somebody bad
all right here's a
counter-argument to the um
the ivormectin question
so there was a big study that came out
that said ivermectin totally absolutely
did not work for covet but many of you
think you did and many of you think that
the dosing and and the way they gave it
and
basically that the test was invalid
the data might be valid it's possible
the data was valid but the way they set
up the test to get the data was so
invalid
it wasn't
it wasn't anywhere close to
the way you would actually do it in the
real world and uh so there's a tweet
thread by ethical skeptic
who has lots of data related arguments
that are over my head
so i only point them to you because
maybe some of you are better at
understanding this stuff
but ethical skeptical has a graph
that has a strong argument that the
the ivermectin was
given too late and in one case too
briefly
and that
the nature of kovid
and here's the argument it's a
it acts like a bacteriophage cascade
so with the part you need to know about
that is that the
speculation here
and the speculation is based on pretty
good evidence apparently that there are
some things which once they get underway
there's nothing you could do to it to
stop it
so even if hypothetically ivermectin did
work
if you administer it only after that
cascade has stopped started
it won't work
and he shows data to make that case
data both for the claim that there's a
bacteriophage cascade-like thing
happening similar to
and also that
that the
the ivermectin was administered in the
wrong way
here's my problem with it
here's my problem with it and
at this point i'm neither pro
nor anti-ivermectin
i am why can't we know
i guess i'm i guess i'm
uh perplexed by why we can never know
the answer to the question
and but here's my skepticism of the
skeptic
so i understand the ethical skeptic
argument here
but i have a hard time imagining
that you would see no impact if the drug
actually had a big impact
if the drug
implemented at the exact proper time
was a miracle drug and that was the
claim
i feel like you'd see some impact
i feel as if that so-called cascade
would be
10 less or something if you gave it to
people at the the wrong time
i don't know but i guess i guess we have
to just say well
i guess we'll never know but here's the
question do you think that somebody
would have funded an intentionally
misleading ivermectin study
because they're expensive
to do a randomized controlled trial
that's a lot of money
so do you think we live in a world that
is so
corrupt
that some pharmaceutical company for
example
would fund a really expensive fake study
and make sure the ivormectin was used in
the wrong way
here is the problem
how could that pharmaceutical company
have known
that they could erase all of the
benefits
with this protocol
that was kind of a that would have been
a big gamble wouldn't it
because if the ivormectin showed a let's
say a 10 effect
with the wrong protocol
don't you think people have said ah you
proved it works
now show it again with the right
protocol
i feel like they would have i feel like
this would have been a bad risk
because they had already succeeded in
selling all their
meds
i don't i don't think they needed to
kill ivermectin
it sort of killed itself
so it feels like it would have been too
big of a boot and it could have
backfired
so as a strategy i would have said it
would have been a poor strategy
but as a
a crime and it would have been in my
opinion whether it's illegal or not it
would be a crime in my opinion
um
i think it would just be a bad risk
for something that didn't need to be
done
so i'm skeptical that there was any
intentional malfeasance i would love to
hear the counter argument from the
people who did the study because they
might say something like oh we chose
this protocol
because we talked to ex-experts and they
said this is the one that would work if
anything
something like that
so there's probably a good counter
argument we just haven't heard it
so don't assume that if you haven't
heard the other side they don't have one
we just haven't heard it
however i will recommend the ethical
skeptic to you as a good follow
because his arguments are always based
on data
he always shows his work
i can't tell when he's right or wrong
but it's always provocative i recommend
it
uh
microlesson on reaching a higher level
of awareness
well you don't need a micro lesson you
need micro dosing no just kidding don't
do that
all right um
here's a
compliment of the day
to uh professor scott galloway who's
also a good follow and uh an author
of uh great books you should read
but he he said this and here's the
compliment is going to be in how he
handled this exchange
uh so we'll get to that but he starts
off by saying whatever you think of
elon
maybe the prospective owner of a social
media platform shouldn't be giving
medical advice and he was tweeting
elon musk's own tweet a new one in which
musk
retweeted that
a friend had a bad experience with
ritalin i'm sorry
galloway retweeted musk saying
that musk had a friend with a bad
experience on ritalin
and then musk said be careful of all
neurotransmitter drugs
and so scott galloway is saying you know
maybe
that's somebody who should not be giving
medical advice
and i said in the comments
to professor galloway
are you doing that now
isn't that an example of professor
galloway giving medical advice
let me make my case
suppose elon musk had said
you should watch your diet
and and exercise
would that be medical advice
of course that's medical advice but
would anybody care
no
nobody would care
why would they say hey elon musk don't
give us any medical advice no they
wouldn't care because they agree with
the medical advice
see where i'm going
so
what elon musk said is that he had a
friend who had a bad experience on
ritalin
that's neither
that's not like something to disagree
with is it
that's just an anecdote
and and it's only being presented as an
anecdote it's not being presented as you
know data
and then he says be careful of all
neurotransmitter drugs shouldn't you be
careful of all drugs that strong
it wouldn't matter what category it was
isn't that pretty good advice to be
careful of a neurotransmitter drug i
would be very careful of that
in fact there are a few things more
regulated in society than
neurotransmitter drugs
try to get adderall
not easy
right it's very regulated
so he's saying exactly what the um
what the medical community was saying be
careful of all neurotransmitter drugs be
darn sure you know why you're going to
use it
that seems like good medical advice
and the one bad experience on ritalin is
just telling you that all drugs have a
potential negative side
who who disagrees with that
is there any doctor who would say no all
drugs are good and they don't have side
effects
nobody
nobody would say that
so
um
here's the compliment to scott galloway
so giving you the the
set up here again he was saying the elon
musk probably shouldn't give you medical
advice
but i was noting that he was doing that
now
that professor galloway by saying that
elon musk shouldn't be giving this
advice
isn't it telling you that advice is
wrong
so here's what galloway
replied
to me saying are you doing that now he
said maybe
comma comma comma
yes
dot dot
don't know
and then he closes with anyway big fan
so you must read dilbert
uh
but
if you watch twitter you're kind of
you're kind of accustomed to people just
defending whatever the hell they said
no matter how ridiculous
and
when i pointed out that
criticizing somebody's medical advice is
medical advice
instead of arguing the point
galloway just said well baby
yes i don't know
which was actually
i don't know if you could have written a
better response
so
but he i think he got to make his case
while also being you know as human as
you could be in this situation so i'll
give him i'll give him credit for that
um and i'm not sure i'm not sure he was
giving medical advice i just think it
was an interesting question it's like
isn't the
you know rejecting medical advice that
is medical advice isn't it
that's all i was adding to that
all right that ladies and gentlemen
concludes
the best
live stream you've ever seen in your
life
i think it was full of twists and turns
and unexpected things uh reframes that
you didn't see coming i believe some of
you
20 of the women 25 of the women watching
here just had a great upgrade to your
experience
and
i believe
that you're all a little better off for
this live stream
and i'm going to turn off youtube
because

locals crowd subscription service you
should check it out
bye for now
