where have i been
it's like i'm late i can't be late
no that just wouldn't be right
hey everybody come on in come on in
it's time for the best part of the day
yeah i tell you that every time and
every time you're a little bit skeptical
and then by the end of the day you say
he was right again
it was the best part of my day and all
you need to enjoy it
to its fullest to its maximum potential
is a
copper mug or glass of tanker shells or
steiner canteen junk or flask vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
including your supreme court nominations
it's called the simon
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
oh yes divine
let me begin by talking about your
entertainment
options which are looking good by the
way
i've told you before that i don't like
fiction
but uh i'm going to give you some
nonfiction
and some one fiction that is totally
worth
watching you ready
star trek discovery is coming back for
his third season
come on you care a little bit now
unfortunately you have to have cbs
all access so it's a subscription
service
and i'll tell you what's unusual about
this
if you're like me in this particular way
it may have annoyed you
that there's a trend in science fiction
where they remove all the male
lead characters because traditionally it
was a male lead for science fiction
and they replaced them with women and
women of color
and you say to yourself i get what
you're trying to do
i'm all for the diversity i like the
inclusiveness of it
but it feels like when you try to put
too hard
the social filter on stuff it can it can
step on the creative part
and so when i'd watch it i think uh
you're you're just trying
too hard to be inclusive which is good
inclusivity all great but sometimes
it's a tough fit into an existing
property
and of course star trek did a version of
that the star trek discovery did
by casting the lead as a woman of color
and when i first turned it on i said to
myself oh it's going to be another one
of these shows
where no no offense to the the actors or
any of the people involved
there's there's no no insult nothing
going on here that's negative it's just
i just wanted to watch a show
right i didn't need to be preached to i
don't need
bigfest i just wanted to watch a star
trek show
and then i turn it on and i'm going to
give them credit the the actress that
they cast in the lead role
who plays the part of michael burnham so
here's the part that
that is funny without any explanation
they made the lead character in this
star trek
i think she's black she's a woman of
color
and her first name is michael spelled
exactly like a guy
and i i'd love to hear the story behind
that
was it originally written for a man and
they just said let's just keep the name
or is it a wink to what they were doing
is it a way to tell the audience okay
okay audience
you know maybe we're trying a little too
hard to make this inclusive
but we're going to wink at you and just
keep the name of the character a man's
name
and i don't know i don't know what the
real story is behind it but
here's the punch line to it all the lead
actress that they picked
is really good she's really good and
if you watch the thing you do come away
saying okay they picked the right person
the casting was actually really really
good
and the show is tremendous so
i love the show you have to be a star
trek
fan to like it but i would say it's
maybe one of the best
it's definitely movie quality production
and more on entertainment did you know
that if you have the premium version of
youtube
that you can listen to content such as
this
while you're using your other apps so i
was
informed yesterday that you have to have
the premium version or it doesn't work
i didn't know that when i first tweeted
about it but if you have premium youtube
which you should have because i would
say youtube is the
the best entertainment platform right
now of all
of all entertainment tv movies streaming
netflix
if you counted them all they don't
really add up
to anything close to what youtube is as
an entertainment platform
and that feature to be able to use your
other apps is important
so get the premium if you want to have
that feature
um here's some more entertainment and
this was really good
all right um the plot against the
president
by lee smith now you may have heard of
it
it goes through the whole story of devin
noonan and the
the russia collusion now you're going to
say to yourself the same thing that i
said to myself
i said scott you are sick of that story
because you've been hearing nothing but
russia call origin
for months and months and months and
years in fact
i was completely blown away by how much
i didn't know
about that story and the stuff you don't
know
really matters and
while i knew all the parts so in
a general way i knew this part happened
this person was involved
something generally like this happened
but when you see it all put together
in a package and and then you can see
the connections and how everything is
connected to everything else
it is abso freaking mind-blowingly
you won't even be the same after you
watch it
this is one of those pieces of content
that when you walk away you say to
yourself
all right i'm now a different person
i would say that it changed me
it literally changed me because going
into it i would have said to
myself yeah lots of people made sketchy
decisions
i think in some way you know they're bad
people we should avoid that
i had sort of general feelings about
that whole thing
but wow when you see it packaged and you
realize
what real people did people that were
elected
people who were put in important
positions
when you see it all together it will
change you
your suddenly what you thought were
conspiracy theories before
sometimes you'll hear a story and you'll
say to yourself
yeah right on the surface you know
that's not true
because people don't know that kind of
thing
that only happens in movies in the real
world
nobody's going to put together this
complicated plot to overthrow the
government
come on that's not going to
watch the watch the film it's called
plot again
the plot against the president you can
get it on vimeo i think it's on amazon
and um pay for it make sure you pay for
it
no don't pick up an illegal one and
it's mind-blowing it's absolutely
mind-blowing
cernovich is in it does a great job um
here's a poll i'd like to see i'd like
to see a poll
over time of how afraid citizens are
of coronavirus because
there must be a change and i'd like to
see if president trump's
persuasion on this is any part of that
change
but wouldn't you like to know how afraid
were you in march
how afraid were you in april may june
did anything change
was it always about the same did it go
down did it go up
because you'll learn more about it um i
would love to see that
poll because the president's persuasion
on this
i judge it to be powerful but you can't
really tell if persuasion is working
until you
until you measure it somehow so you
could be really really experienced
with persuasion and you still don't know
exactly
how well something is working you just
have to measure it because you can be
you could be fooled um
here's a uh here's a question
how many people have uh gotten
coronavirus and then also
got uh um regeneron
and maybe rem deserver one or the other
or both
how many people died anyway
after receiving regeneron or
remdezvir or both i don't know if they
ever use them both
so that's open question um because i
think they're used at different
phases so if you're using the regeneron
maybe you never need to use the rim
deserver
if you're using the rem deserver it's
probably because you didn't use the
regeneron
they're sort of different i think
they're different phases fact-check me
on that
but how many people are dying if they
get that
don't you want to know because i guess
we don't have quite enough
not well not quite enough we don't have
nearly enough regeneron
but they're making it as fast as they
can are we
close to a point where your survival
was let's say your survival rate was 99
point
something have we taken that survival
rate which was already quite good
and moved it to way better because
that's what drugs do
right they don't add nothing so wouldn't
you like to see the
the untreated coronavirus death rate
and compare that to the treated
coronavirus
death rate because i got to tell you
and and this obviously makes a
difference on your
do you have health care and you know
what's your economic situation
do you have to go to work eight hours a
day that so not everybody can do
what i say i would do but the number
will grow and what i would do is this
the first moment that i felt a symptom
that i thought was actually coronavirus
i would be
on top of my doctor threatening
that if i don't get regenerate in the
next 10 minutes i'm gonna
i'm gonna find a new doctor
and now you would probably do the same
now i
i have to admit uh this comes very close
to the category of
white privilege it's certainly a rich
person privilege
because i can go into my health care
provider and you know shake the walls
and
cause trouble and say you're going to
give me a regeneron or i'm going to go
to another doctor
but i'm not going to not have regeneron
by the end of today so
let me let me assure you that i'm going
to be on regeneron
and it's going to happen by the end of
today you can either be part of it or
not
that's the only option you're getting as
my doctor because i'm going to get this
this this this is going in my body it's
going to happen today
now this assumes that doctors will you
know also say it would help
i wouldn't i'm not my own doctor i would
need a doctor to say
you need this but do
do poor people act like that no
probably not they're not going to be
doctor shopping
and and going hard at their doctor it's
sort of a privileged
rich person thing to do i hate to say it
but we should be i hope very close
maybe weeks away from having enough
that you just have to want it and your
doctor just has to know it works
and maybe you're okay maybe you'll get
it so if
you if you don't know that number what
uh
you know how many people die if they get
regenerate and if they get
and when i say regeneron and rem
deserver
you should fill in in your head without
me having to say it
also zinc also vitamin d also
i don't know aspirin whatever the hell
it is that they're giving i'm just
thinking that those
two drugs might be the key ones as far
as we know
all right so uh
if we don't know that death rate do we
know anything
because i feel the old death rates
should be thrown away
let me say this a little bit clearly
when you look at the death rates of
coronavirus
it's always who died today thrown into
an average of all the people who died in
the past
the people who died in the past were
pre-therapy
so all those numbers of how many people
died in the past should be thrown away
now
because we're we're at least at the cusp
of having a therapy only or close to it
therapy only situations so we should
at this point we should make a national
decision that we're going to throw away
the historical data or at least measure
it two different ways
one is pre-therapies being widely
available
however you define therapies and post
therapies being available it's it has to
be more than just
it exists has to be available to use in
quantity
all right so the longer we go
we're showing that blended number of
pre-therapies existing
and post therapies and acting like
that's one big number you can shove
together
and it means something we are not doing
the right job
we're just not doing the right job and
if i were president trump that's the
first thing i'd do i'd say
whoa we have a choice about how we count
this stuff
we don't have to count it in a
misleading way
let's let's continue with our old
numbers but show them separately
you could show you could show the
blended number and then also
in addition show the separate numbers
because without that separate number
you don't know as much as you need to
know you can't manage your risk
to the wrong number all right
um i'm going to talk about the
coronavirus a little bit more in a
minute we'll get back to that
um i love when politicians score an
own goal if you don't follow soccer and
or
as my non-american's friend friends call
it
football if you don't follow the sport
you don't know what an own goal is but
it means that you accidentally
score a goal in your own goal instead of
where you're
supposed to be scoring and democrats
have done this maybe
at least twice lately
and they're always funny the first one
is
and i noticed this the other day it got
a ton of retweets
i think people were laughing that
democrats have found a way to gaslight
themselves
which is the funniest thing in the world
so first of all they invent this term
gaslighting
which they use incorrectly gaslighting
the the real term for it is not just
trying to fool somebody
they use it in a generic way i i think i
will allow
i'm about on the border of allowing that
common usage
would allow that gaslighting just means
you're trying to fool somebody
it doesn't mean that what it means is
you're trying to make them think they're
crazy
so that they think they have an actual
mental problem that's that's the
original term gaslighting
so that's not what's happening people
are trying to
fool people but they're not trying to
make them think they're actually crazy
however so i so i'll start using maybe
gas lighting
in the the popular way
even though it's incorrect and democrats
have gas
lighted themselves which i've never seen
before
they've gaslighted themselves and the
way they've done that is they've
they've frightened trump supporters into
silence so they're they've been so bad
to trump supporters that trump
supporters go into hiding
including i think when pollsters call
so the democrats have scared
trump supporters into hiding which has
the
uh ironic not erotic i guess we'll just
use words to mean anything today
ironic is another one of those words
that that passed into popular usage just
meaning
it's a funny situation when you know
it didn't used to mean that it used to
be actually ironic
but forget that i digress
my point is the democrats have scared
trump supporters into hiding but then
here's the funny part
they've scared trump supporters into
hiding but they still believe the polls
you see where i'm going to this i don't
think that could be funnier
it would be one thing to scare trump
supporters into hiding
and then not believe the polls because
you caused the poll
your own actions caused the polls not to
be reliable
because you think well maybe they're
just not admitting they they support
trump
so that's the irony is that their own
actions
will cause them if trump wins again and
i think he will
if trump wins again the level of
surprise
and shock that they're about to
experience
might even surpass 2016 because in 2016
it was a pretty big shock but if
if after four years of what they believe
is obvious to everyone in the world
that trump has you know botched
everything and destroyed everything and
he's
you know he's hitler and the plague
they've had four years to live in this
artificial world they've created for
themselves
and so now now if he gets reelected
nothing makes sense in the world their
whole world
doesn't make sense if you could watch
four years of this orange monster
and still reelect him what's going on
it's not in the democratic world this
wouldn't just be
oh i wish my party had been elected
this would be a reality destroying
event like brains would actually melt
not actually but you know figuratively
melt
you would see people probably
hospitalized
not probably almost definitely i would
say
hospitalized with mental illness there
is a gigantic
mental illness risk ahead of us i've
been really big
i don't know if it will my guess is that
there will be
protests and a little bit of violence
but we'll get past it
so get ready for that um
here so we're seeing more uh anecdotal
reports
of ballots being mailed to the wrong
people
so it was just another report of
somebody
who got three different ballots one was
for
somebody who used to live in the home
one was for the landlord who owned the
home
and one was for somebody else who was
dead or something
so there are lots and lots of examples
of people who are getting a hold of
other people's balance now that's a
problem right
if you have thousands and thousands of
people it looks like it's
you know if you were to judge by the
anecdotal evidence which is not really
evidence it's just
uh stuff you see it could be
tens of thousands if you looked
nationally
could it be a hundred thousand ballots
that
didn't need to be sent out got so sent
to the wrong people
it's a pretty big number but here's the
here's the thing i need you to fact
check
it is my understanding and it's a fairly
uh new understanding
so i didn't know this until recently
that there is some kind of technology
for
matching signatures on a ballot
to the driver's license records which
also have your signature
now what are the odds that let's say
their previous tenant's ballot
comes to you and you think to yourself
[Music]
i just doubled my vote i got my own
ballot
but i've got the previous residence
ballot too
i'm going to vote twice i'm not even
going to get caught
i'll make sure i don't put my
fingerprints on it i'll uh you know they
won't check that anyway probably
uh and i'll just i'll just see what
happens i'll just
just drop this in the mail let's just
see what happens
what would happen i think the automatic
signature comparison thing pops it out
of the system
now once it gets popped out of the
system and again this is the part that i
need you to fact check
for me fact check that if it gets
rejected
and i believe it would because the
signatures would not match
don't they contact the voter
and say there's probably a phone number
on it don't they contact the voter and
say are you a real person can you prove
you're really this person why doesn't
your signature match
now sometimes the signature doesn't
match because let's say
somebody got parkinson you know they
said their signature
is older it doesn't match the the other
way and usually the person will just say
oh yeah i just changed my signature
don't worry about it
and then it's allowed but i don't think
that the people who are just going to
fill out with somebody else's ballot
i don't think they're going to count but
that's what uh
that's what i need the fact check on i'm
seeing in the comments
uh my understanding which is that it's
some states
but not all but remember
the adams rule of uh adam's law
of slow-moving disasters if it was true
a month ago
that nobody had these that not all of
the states had the technology
to automatically check signatures is it
still true
one month later because normally you
can't get anything done in one month
if you've ever worked in any big
organization you know one month is the
time you're just
getting ramped up to do anything
but in an emergency if you knew
oh my god if we don't have this
technology
checking signatures our whole state is
going to be thrown out
could you get it in a month if it was an
emergency
i think you could i think you could get
that technology in a month
in an emergency so does that mean that
um does that mean that
all the states are safe i doubt it but
i'll bet they're moving
really as fast as uh
as fast as possible all right so i got
my ballot
uh in the mail so i'm gonna be filling
that out pretty soon
all right michigan apparently has a uh
eight point lead in the official polls
so if you look at the public polls and i
guess if you take an average i think
there or at least some recent polls have
an eight point lead
for biden in michigan key state
but the internal gop polling shows a
dead even
what does that tell you what does it
tell you
that the gop polling which
only exists to be accurate
right if you're if you're the republican
party or you're the democratic party
and you're paying for your own internal
polling meaning the public won't
see it you need that to be accurate
because you're never going to hire
anybody again who gives you
inaccurate internal polling
all right a public polling place can be
wrong
and just blow it off and say well we got
that one wrong but look at all these
other ones we got right
an internal polling company can't get
something really wrong
and expect to ever do this work again
they got to get it right
the external polling as has been
well documented apparently they're not
trying to get the right answer
apparently they are politically
manipulating
not in every case not in every case i'm
not talking about every poll company
but it's pretty obvious at this point
that they are
uh rigging the polls the the public ones
so but imagine this an eight-point
swing an eight-point
swing that is not even trying to hide it
you know if you had a let's say a
two-point difference
between your internal pollings and your
external you could say to yourself well
maybe the internal polling are just
telling their client what they want to
hear
and then if they're wrong they're only
wrong by two percent maybe that's still
good enough to get the job next year
but if you're wrong by if you've got a
difference of
eight somebody is not trying to poll
one of those two entities is not even
trying to get it right
at that at that level of difference
all right um i guess portland had
another riot last night
except you know there's nothing funny
about a riot
except except this one
i don't know that anybody got hurt so i
can laugh about it
uh so there's apparently uh
antifa
antifa has an indigenous uh
wing so these are people who were
indigenous to the united states i guess
uh native americans etc and
they are a separate wing of antifa
and they had their own day of rage i
guess this is you know
protesting columbus or something and
now the funny part is not that they have
a they have a complaint
because i'm all for anybody who has a
complaint
voicing their complaint free country and
everything and certainly the
indigenous people have plenty to
complain about
so you know if if indigenous people want
to complain
i think we ought to listen to them right
i mean they have they have some genuine
stuff to complain about there
and you know as well many other people
have genuine complaints
uh but the fact that antifa is now
splintering into factions
is just too perfect because you know you
can
you can see what's going to happen right
you know where this is going
day one antifa is like a little group
that's against
the government right day two
now they've got their different segments
they've got your
indigenous antifa it won't be long
before there's
black antifa won't won't be long before
there's
maybe asian american antifa is
don't don't you think it's completely
predictable the antifa will break down
by
by gender and lb uh lgbtq
and uh and a whole bunch of other
categories
because the left is all about categories
and if they can make a category they're
gonna make one and then they're gonna
form a little power unit around it
because there will always be somebody
who says you know if i could sell
an lgbtq forum of antifa
and i'm in the lgbtq
i might be like a leader i could become
a leader
if i make this little if i carve out a
little category that i would be the head
of
so it's sort of a you know
a natural progression the antifa will
destroy itself
which is hilarious if you just let
antifa be antifa
it will destroy itself now let me uh
make an analogy a lot of people made
isis analogies
to antifa but there's one one part of
that analogy
analogy that works really well and it
goes like this
uh as soon as isis went from being you
know a terrorist group
to holding territory i said to myself
um how's that going to work
because the whole thing that makes isis
work
is that you don't know where to find
them but the moment they hold territory
and form you know proper armies and
proper governments
they have targets and these targets are
completely vulnerable to
the united states and allies and
russians and
anybody else who wants to bomb them so i
said to myself this is a little like the
dog chasing a car
as long as the dog is chasing the car
the world is in balance
everything's working but what if the dog
catches the car
there's no model for that like it
doesn't work
the dog can't eat the car it can't bite
the car
it's the chasing that mattered likewise
with isis it was the terrorism that
mattered as soon as they tried to hold
territory it can't work
it can't work to hold territory qaeda
can't do it
isis can't do it they're just too
bombable as soon as they hold territory
well uh antifa is the same thing
the natural the natural evolution of
antifa
should be that they're going to try to
hold territory or they're going to try
to have some kind of a
more formalized organization the moment
they're organized
they're a target the moment they hold
territory
you can tear it apart like jazz you know
you can let it run a little bit but then
you can
tear it apart so the more successful
antifa
are the closer they are to extinction
does that make sense because with isis
the closer they were to like holding
territory
the closer they were to extinction
because that was the point that they
could be attacked and killed
so i think that's the that's where
antifa is going
they will become organized to the point
where they're vulnerable
and then law enforcement will exploit
the vulnerability and then
take them down
so one of my favorite stories
that could not be a more perfect story
to explain trump and the era that we're
in
is that trump is publicly claiming that
he has immunity
immunity
he has immunity to the coronavirus
because he's recovered from it
now is there anything that's more
perfectly trump than that
if there was one thing you were going to
remember from this whole era
it would be that because
um you know i think i think i'm going to
have to admit
obviously i'm a big trump supporter but
not everything he does
makes each one of us happy in each
moment
and i would say
that president trump's skill set
is highly optimized toward a number of
things
defeating isis getting you know getting
tough with china
so his his skill set is sort of perfect
for a whole bunch of tasks that are very
important to the country
let me tell you what it's not good for
it's not good at all
talking about medical stuff because when
you're talking about medical stuff
you just can't use hyperbole it's just
the wrong place for
you know over optimism and hyperbole and
it just doesn't fit so there's somebody
in the comments who
might be out of date i had said that i
wasn't going to vote for trump
after his bad handling of the disavowing
white supremacist comments
but he later disavowed them in
clean clear unambiguous language as he
has done many times in the past
i was never doubting why he was thinking
i was
i was being angry at the way he handled
it once he handled it correctly
i don't have a problem with him all
right because he just needed
he needed to do that for the benefit of
his supporters
and then he did i'm good
as a general rule if you fix your if you
fix your mistake
i'm good with you right i don't i don't
live in the past
mistake's a mistake we all make mistakes
we all sub-optimize
but if you fix it that's about as good
as you can do
as a human being you're not going to be
flawless but you can certainly fix your
mistakes
all right so trump claiming immunity and
i guess that caused twitter to
block his tweet about it and say it was
sketchy
but facebook did not block it so
facebook did not put a warning and did
not block it
and cnn is reporting that it was a false
statement
that is a false statement that he is
immune and maybe he can't get it again
now the president left a little bit of
equivocation there
because he said he doesn't know if he's
permanently
immune but he thinks he is at the moment
now is that fact
untrue no it's not
it's not untrue it is unproven
whether or not it's true we don't know
we don't know there's some disagreement
among experts
and therefore as non-experts and trump's
a non-expert in this field as well
we don't know right so
when cnn tries to sell you a story that
says we know it's not true
what is that it's a fake medical claim
it is it is a false medical claim
by by anybody to say that you don't get
immunity
because we also don't know that
what is true and and here's what here's
what i believe
to be true without the benefit of
expertise
so you should not listen to me this is
simply my
internal belief you can check it against
your own
my internal belief is that trump is
probably
right because our history with
coronavirus
is such that having it once
and confers immunity rand paul
says the same thing quite vigorously he
had it also
and he claims that he is has immunity
and he is
medically trained so he's a medically
trained person
who's saying well it's not proven
that you have immunity but everything we
know about coronavirus
strongly suggests strongly really
strongly suggests
that you do now i think there's some
issue of their
their anecdotal stories of some people
who seem to be
have been infected twice if that's true
that certainly throws it open to
question
but would that be the sort of thing that
could happen commonly
or were those people never really
cured and so really they always had it
they never got rid of it and it flared
back up
was it maybe the way they do the testing
this suggests they were still
infected but maybe they weren't the
second time
no no so there's certainly some
some uncertainty on this question but i
think that they need
twitter maybe needs to do a better job
of labeling it
there's a big difference between
something that's probably true but
unproven
and i think that's where the president's
situation falls into
meaning that based on everything we know
about coronaviruses and immunity
he's probably right but it's unproven
there's a big difference between
something that's probably right
but unproven and something that's just
false
and yeah i don't think you should treat
them the same but
i would i would admit that if the
president is wrong about this
it could could be a big problem i do
think we should know
that it's uncertain i do think you
should know that
that nothing's 100 um
all right so here's a question for you
let's say uh you and i both eat a peanut
and i eat a peanut and i just enjoy
eating my peanut you eat the peanut and
you die
because you have a peanut allergy did
the peanut
kill you or was it the peanut
allergy that killed you because
i ate the peanut so the peanut is not
deadly
because i ate it and it didn't hurt me a
bit
but it killed you so was it the peanut
that killed you
or your underlying peanut allergy that
killed you
because this sort of thing matters if
you're looking at the coronavirus and
what's the cause of death if
if you and i are both 75
but you've got terminal cancer and i
don't we both get the coronavirus
i live and you don't was it the
coronavirus that killed you
because remember i got it too if the
coronavirus didn't kill me
the only thing that's different is you
had a comorbidity and i didn't
i'd say it was the comorbidity that
killed you
right because if two people could be
shot with the same bullet
and one person it just bounces off and
the other person that kills them
is it the bullet that killed him because
apparently bullets are not deadly
unless you've got some kind of
underlying you know immunity to bullets
and this is the worst analogy anybody
ever made
you should just erase that one for your
mind immediately pretend i didn't even
say it
right the bullet one is bad the penal
one is pretty good
so uh i think the way we count this
stuff really has to be examined
i'm not the first person to say that all
right
and but i'm wondering if the regeneron
and rem deserver
turn out to be really game changers
wouldn't we say that the real risk of
death is no longer the coronavirus
but the but the lack of proper care
think about that if we're at a point and
we might be
where the only way you're going to die
from the coronavirus is if you don't get
proper care soon enough or you've got
something going on with you that's so so
bad health-wise
that it's going to take you out even if
you get proper care
so in both of those cases it feels like
the cause of death
you can make an argument would be lack
of proper care if everybody who gets the
proper care survives
except for this sliver of people who are
so sick with something else that they
were gonna
you know something would have taken him
out pretty soon
all right um so it's real
it's real uh murky area when you get
your social platforms
fact checking um
all right all right let's see what just
looking at my own notes here
uh liz peek wrote a piece on uh
foxnews.com and
um she talks about another own goal
this one from pelosi
and this own goal goes like this so
pelosi came up with this idea
of doing some legislation to formalize
the process of removing the president
for incapacity incapacitation i guess
so uh we have the uh you know the 25th
amendment
so the constitution allows that a
president can be removed if they're not
not functioning uh mentally or
physically
and she wanted to formalize that
you know so that there's a real
procedure there now
that of course sounds like something
being used against
trump and if you were watching my
periscopes
and live streams you know that when
trump was on the steroids
even i was saying um i would watch out
for that
because he's talking like a person on
steroids
he's saying things that are even a
little bit more trumpian than trump
just a little that doesn't mean i'm
right
it just means that the drug has that
side effect it's a known
common side effect it'll make you feel a
little a little peppier
and a little more confident than maybe
you should
and a little more aggressive than you
should so i was
i thought that was a legitimate question
two weeks ago
or a week ago time is the time is
completely screwed up now
so i thought that was a right question a
week ago if it's true that trump is off
of that drug
um and that would be the one i'd be
worried about then i would say that's no
longer
an issue and i think nancy pelosi
was trying to sell us on the fact that
it was a general
need it wasn't directed at president
trump it was
you know it was maybe she thought of it
because of that but it's really about
the future
and then president trump uh cleverly
he hinted that the i don't know where he
was when he did this but
according to liz peak he hinted that the
bill's real purpose
was to make it simpler for democrats to
remove joe biden later
where have you heard that before
that's right i'm not the only person who
said it but other people on social media
were saying
i think joel pollock uh tweeted and
wrote on this as well
for breitbart that uh
you better watch out for this nancy
pelosi because
we're sort of on to you it looks like
maybe the real reason
is to get rid of biden later to make it
easier
and once you have that frame
and people accept that as oh yeah that
would make it easier to get rid of biden
if necessary
and you add that to the fact that as liz
peake says
the rasmussen poll from august showed 59
percent of
likely voters believe that biden won't
finish a four-year term
so you know some pushing two-thirds of
voters uh think that he won't make it
four years
now if you think that and you see pelosi
getting ready with this
uh 25th amendment thing
then it becomes just strikingly clear
strikingly clear that kamala harris
is the one you need to be looking at as
the candidate
and she does not have the popularity of
joe biden
so it's a fairly devastating change of
frame if you could actually get
democrats to to change their focus
from well it's biden we'll do what we
can you know he'll have lots of good
advisors
you know whatever if you can change the
frame to
it's really kamala harris and by the way
i'm trying to say her name correctly
because i'm just learning how to
pronounce it correctly um
i learned that from trey gowdy on tv the
other night
he admitted he'd been saying her name
wrong for forever
he just learned how to say it correctly
um so i'll try to follow his uh
model there and so it's kamala
not kamala i believe that is correct
um and you should try to get that right
too the one thing we should do is try to
get people's names right
i i feel like that's sort of you know
basic respect
uh even if they're your opponents um
all right so that's an interesting thing
and i have to ask you this would would
president trump
have gone with that play of saying well
maybe that's really about biden
would he have come up with that if not
for social media
interesting question isn't it because
i've been saying from
for a few years now that the thing that
makes
trump special one of the things there's
a whole lot of things that make him
special
but one of the things is that he's more
tapped into social media
than other candidates in other words he
understands the medium better than other
people
he follows that he absorbs it he
you know he takes value from it in a way
that i've never seen before
and part of the value he extracts from
social media
is that it's being it's a continuous a b
testing for his ideas so if you were to
follow
you know the top i know top 50
influential trump-leaning
accounts and i'm sure that the white
house does
exactly that i i feel fairly confident
saying
that the white house and lots of people
in the white house
do follow the top 50 or so
uh conservative voices or approach off
people
and if those people put out an idea
that's good
the president's going to know about it
either directly because he saw it or
somebody
smart on his staff said oh this one's
this one got a lot of tweets
you know look at the retweets on this
one this one's this one's going to sell
and then it comes out of the president's
mouth so
when you see that model being worked
successfully
that is part of trump's brilliance
uh let's talk about court packing as
has been uh noted by many pundits
the democrats are trying this play where
they're just changing the definition of
court packing
and they're turning it into filling the
position
when it's almost uh election time
that that's court packing now as opposed
to increasing the number
of uh of seats now of course republicans
are saying
foul foul you can't use those same words
for a whole different thing
chord packing there are those are our
words we're using it for increasing the
number
not filling an open seat that's
different
does it matter i'm not sure that any of
that conversation matters to anybody
but it confuses things and maybe that's
good for the
the democrats just keep things confusing
now here's the thing
the fact that joe biden and kamala
harris
both tell you they won't give you an
answer on court packing
that's disqualifying that's it
in my opinion given that core packing
has such a high likelihood of destroying
the republic
and i'd say maybe a third 30 or so
if i had to guess i'd say court packing
has a 30
chance of destroying the united states
that's why the founders were not in
favor of it necessarily
was it the founders or at least people
like ruth bader
ginsburg people like joe biden when he
talked about it in the past
pretty much all of the smart wise
normal people from the past have said
whoa whoa if you cross that norm if you
violate that norm it's not written in
the constitution it has to be nine
but if you start messing with that
you've turned the court into a purely
political organ
that has no value for deciding things
it would just be whatever the the
the the group in power wanted so if you
had a
president and a senate that were
republican you'd have
59 republican you know
supreme court people and then the
democrats win the next year
now there's 110 supreme court people
basically
the supreme court would lose all
credibility now you could argue
that it already did and that the
difference between
you know having court packing and what
we see today which is
if you get a few extra conservatives on
there things go your way
i don't know if it's that different in
terms of
the outcome i just don't but i'll tell
you what does matter
having it close to 50 50.
our best situation is that the court
would be locked
50 50. if i were president
and here's a reason why i would never be
president because of the following
policy
if i were president i would lock up the
court
and i would make sure that i appointed
whatever is the one that was in the
minority
until they were exactly even and here's
why
if if a court that is 50 50
makes a decision you're going to say to
yourself okay
that's probably pretty valid and that's
probably just following the constitution
because they're 50 50. and if they can
get a decision out of this that isn't a
tie
somebody got convinced i would call that
credible
if you have let's say a one person
majority
and that one person might be you know
justice roberts
sometimes he he votes a way you don't
expect
still credibility because
because obviously there are situations
and there are numerous of them
in which things didn't go quite the way
you thought and that one person majority
didn't give you what you hoped it would
so being exactly even
or being off by one completely
credible court what happens when you've
got a solid
two-person or three-person majority on
the court
revolution revolution
because one way to ruin the court is to
have a solid majority for either the
left or the right which is where we're
heading
so the acb let's assume
amy coney barrett gets gets on the court
you'll have like a a two plus depending
on what you think about roberts
you know a two plus solid majority of
conservatives
is that a credible situation
nope nope it's completely um
completely acceptable constitutionally
it's completely acceptable if you're a
conservative
but is it credible to the people who
have to live under it who would prefer
it when a different way
the answer is no it isn't and so i would
argue that the amy coney
barrett nomination will destabilize the
country
now maybe not enough for a revolution
but it's a destabilizing effect the best
stability would be a lot closer to
an even number now could president trump
get away with you know in in a
hypothetical could he nominate
uh you know a left-leaning judge
and say look we want to keep this
credible we want to keep it at least
closer to uh
to even we're all going to be better off
if they only make decisions when it's
obvious that the constitution
supports it so i'm just gonna try to
keep it even
no he would be voted out in a heartbeat
he wouldn't have a chance
so the president doesn't have that
option he kind of has to do what he's
doing go aggressive
try to keep the majority as long as you
can protect the country
but it's very destabilizing and i think
the it's the worst
it's the second worst situation the
worst
situation would be court packing the
second to worst
is what's happening right now and by the
way i'm not saying that i'm
disagreeing with having conservative
judges i think the idea
of being originalists and trying to
stick to the
you know stick to the constitution just
makes sense it just makes
good good sense that having clean rules
even if they don't work perfectly if we
all agree with them and they're credible
and they're clean and they've worked for
a while
that's just a better situation all right
so that's what we're um and today though
all the the yakking will be about amy
coney barrett's
religion and catholicism is it just me
or are the rest of you completely over
that conversation
here's what i don't care about even a
little bit
her religion what in what world did i
wake up in
in which catholicism is radical
when did catholics become radical what
world did i wake up in
that were even asking this stupid
question yeah
yeah those catholics got to watch out
for those catholics
what it's the question that shouldn't
even be
we should just be bored by it you know
the big question is are you conservative
or are you liberal those are gigantic
questions because those absolutely will
guarantee which way you
vote on most things but your religion
you know as long as you're in one of the
the mainstream religions
i feel like you're probably okay now we
haven't yet
tested an islamic justice
but that's coming better get ready for
that
that's coming and that does open up a
whole new set of questions because
sharia and the you know is the islamic
is the islamic community as willing as
other
communities to you know to say the law
is the law
and our religion can stand aside
we'll see someday we'll we'll have to uh
wrestle with that um
oh i forgot to mention i think this was
also from
this come from sheryl atkinson i think
said this on twitter
that the uh the democrats are saying
they don't want to do the
nomination supreme court nomination
until after the election
does that sound fair to do the the
supreme
court nomination after the election
because that way
you guarantee that the person who's
doing the nominating
is who the the country wanted
and uh i think it was sheryl atkinson
who pointed out um
this is after the election
right now today this is after the
election
it's after the 2016 election we did wait
until
after the election that's now and
maybe it doesn't seem like you know
it's after the election because the
whole the whole russia collusion thing
made us think that the election wasn't
over for three years
it felt like maybe the election's not
exactly over
maybe the russians did something maybe
maybe it's illegitimate maybe it didn't
count
but you know now that the mueller report
is out and the ig report is out
um i think we can say that election's
over
and trump won and therefore that's it
he gets to nominate and i think that's
what's going to happen
here's uh what i think trump ought to
think about in terms
of branding i think he's doing at the
moment a really strong job
strong he's doing a good job
in making a play for black votes and i
think that's what a lot of us wanted to
see
maybe some maybe some didn't want to see
that but i wanted to see it
and from the beginning i've been saying
you know i might be crazy
but i feel like even despite all the
things said about trump
i feel as if he might get more black
votes than
any republican ever now i've been saying
that for several years
and i know that was maybe the least
credible thing i've ever said
in the beginning when i first started
saying this around you know
2017 or so i'm pretty sure
nobody thought that was going to be a
thing
and now it's common knowledge that he
looks like he's going to have
maybe a historically high black vote
still too small
but historically high which is what i
was expecting
here is the framing change that would be
fascinating to see i don't think it's
going to happen i'm not sure i would
recommend it
but it's what i would do and
so right now the conversation is uh you
know black lives matter
and i feel like trump could turn that
into black and jobs matter
now i don't think he'd want to use that
phrase because that that's just too
provocative if you borrow their
phrase it sounds like you're minimizing
the original point
of black lives matter he doesn't need to
minimize that
of course because nobody should be
minimizing that
but here's how i would have framed it
if i'm president i would say this i'll
fix your opportunities
not your feelings that's it that's the
frame
i'll fix your opportunities but i won't
fix your feelings
you're going to have to work on that
yourself and specifically what i'll do
is i'll try to give you school choice
so that you have an opportunity to get a
good education and i'll try to make sure
that you've got opportunity zones
that you've got the what is he called
the platinum plan or something like that
whatever it is
that would provide capital to
underserved
parts of doing a prison reform and then
list a few other things
and say that's my deal i realize
that you know emotions are high and the
way you feel
is the way you feel i'm not going to try
to make you feel differently
that's not my job i'm not the president
of your feelings
i will fight to the death to make sure
that your opportunity
is every bit as good as everybody else's
because that's
america right but your feelings
and what matters and your feelings those
are personal
figured out yourself but i'll be working
on your opportunities
if you want the if you want the party
that will be good for your feelings
but i don't think it's gonna you can see
from experience you can see they're not
fighting for your opportunities
you don't see anything do you what is
biden's plan for the black community
nothing he wants he wants to make you
feel good
not the president's job president could
say i really want you to feel good
but it's not my job it just isn't my job
opportunity i'm gonna i'm gonna die on
that hill i'll i'll
fight for school choice i'll fight for
you know
fair jobs i'll fight for fairness in
every possible way
but your feelings that has to be you
that's just you and and good luck with
it
uh here's another reframing that i think
would be useful we keep running into
people who say
the president killed 200 and whatever
the number is 210 000
dead by his coronavirus handling
instead of arguing that in the
traditional way
i would go with this first i would say
the only people who say that are people
who are not skilled at comparing
things think about that response
imagine you're doing a tv interview oh
by the way
uh i'm going on msnbc
so i think that's tomorrow let me check
my calendar
yes i'll be on erie melber show on
msnbc tomorrow um i've got it at my
my local time three o'clock in
california so that would be
6 p.m eastern time tomorrow tuesday
so if you want to see me on msnbc you
know you do
you know you want to see me on msnbc
now i stopped doing interviews i just i
get a lot of interview requests for
podcasts and stuff
and i'd been saying no to all of them
and i was going to say no
through the end of the election just
because i'm doing other stuff
but when i got the msnbc invitation
i thought to myself i don't think they
know exactly what they're getting here
but if they want to give it a try all
right
so back to my original point if if
somebody challenges you
let's say you're on tv supporting the
president and they cite the
210 000 dead rather than going through
the argument
of why you can't really count all of
those as
the president's death count i would i
would say
you know the only people who are saying
that are the ones who are
who don't have a talent for comparing
things
you know if you've got some extra time i
could walk you through how to do that
but the starting point is that you
should look at
how some other leader would have done in
the american situation
with states having lots of power with a
big country
with you know we've got a bigger black
population they're more vulnerable
we have more obesity unfortunately and
they're more vulnerable
so the real question if you were good at
comparing things
is how would let's say the the leader of
new zealand
how would she have done if she had been
in trump's job and that's
unknowable right
and and then uh that's a way smarter
answer and by the way that's the
that's the big the uh the big picture
technique
um i would also if you had extra time
you could bring up
switzerland i mentioned this yesterday
switzerland
uh also has you know they've got their
german speaking
their french speaking and i guess
they're flemish speaking areas
and the the outcome for those different
cultures has been wildly different
once you know that one little country
that is well managed i believe
everybody would say switzerland is a
well-managed
country that's that's sort of the
reputation they have i don't know if
it's true
but it's the reputation they have um
and you can see that the same leadership
from the
the top level got wildly different
results
in different cultural areas which
suggests
that leadership is not the primary
variable that there's something we
still don't quite understand about what
it is that people are doing
to cause this now it could be as as i
mentioned yesterday
it could be commuting and travel
differences
doesn't have to be cultural per se could
be just some correlation with certain
groups travel or commute in different
ways could be that
so anyway
i was curious about the claim that there
are more right-wing extremists
killing people in this country then
there are left-wing
extremists and i was looking at a report
today from the center on extremism
so they they study the stuff and i
wanted to see the stats
how many people in the comments before i
give you the answer
i want you to commit to this without
looking anything up
you you've been told by the government
and i believe this is
uh this is backed up by the data that
right-wing
extremism is a bigger problem than
left-wing
extremism now how many total people do
you think were killed
in 20 let's say 2019
because that's was you know a normal
year how many
people were killed by right-wing
extremists in that year
and also prior years because it's not
that different
just off the top of your head
off the top of your head um
scott quit saying flemish please
uh somebody's uh correcting me and
saying it's an italian area not a
flemish
i only know i was reading that there are
flemish speakers
in switzerland is that not true there
may also be an italian section but
is somebody telling me they're not
they're not flemish
speakers oh somebody says they're not
flemish but italian
all right well we'll look that up that's
different question so how many people do
you think were killed by right-wing
extremists
in 2019 the answer is a little over
40 and half of those were in one event
the el paso walmart that
in which 20 people died now here's the
question
how worried should you be about a
problem that kills
40 people a year on average a big year
is like a
mcvay blows up the fbi building it's you
know
over a hundred people but typically
it's just cooking along at around 41 42
per year now
let me let me uh say something that i
criticize
other people about you should worry
about a small problem
that's becoming a big problem you don't
get to say
well only 40 people died this year i
guess we can ignore it
not if next year it's going to be 50 and
the year after that it's going to be
150.
if it looks like it has that potential
then
it's not the number this year it's the
fact that it has that
potential to grow that makes it
important
so how how how concerned should you be
about a problem in the united states
that kills
40 people a year i'm saving the best
part of the story
how many people were killed by islamic
extremism in the united states in 2019
all right so 40-something people killed
by right-wing extremists
how many islamic extremists
how many deaths did they cause in 2019
you ready for this zero
none think about that
under president trump you stopped
worrying
about islamic extremist attacks in the
united states
and in 2019 there were zero
none now i don't want to jinx it because
there could be one right around the
corner you never know
but i don't think that story's been told
and the story is whatever the hell our
government is doing and especially the
the spooky parts of the government that
do the the dirty work that we you don't
want to know about
whatever they're doing it's freaking
working
all right and i don't think i don't even
know who to give credit for that
is that the cia is it the fbi is it
is it because our military pounded isis
so well
and got a hold of their all their
secrets
what exactly is that is it is it the
president
i don't know but whoever did this
this thing that took the scariest thing
in many of our lives after 9 11.
whoever turned that big scary thing into
2019 nothing
whoever did that needs a nobel peace
prize
because that's big and it just sort of
because it happened gradually and we
just sort of slid into it
and maybe because it was a president
trump it just
sort of got ignored one of our biggest
problems
maybe maybe zero now
um now you compare those numbers of 40
some dead by right-wing extremists
do i think we should work on that and
try to and try to control that
yes yes so i worry that somebody's going
to watch this and say
and there he is downplaying right-wing
extremism
i'm not downplaying it it seems like
something you'd really really want to
keep
to zero just like islamic extremism
and anything above zero right-wing
extremism is way too much
right-wing extremism so we should be
putting maximum pressure on it
but let's not keep it out of perspective
you know we're losing perspective on it
in terms of its current size but of
course you want to keep it
from getting bigger
somebody says there is no right wing
extremism well it depends what you would
call
let's say the el paso shooter the
walmart shooter
his problem were mexicans coming from
mexico and immigration he's being called
a white supremacist
i'm no expert but that seems right
wingish
the way it's defined all right
that's about all i got for you today and
i will talk to you
after after today
also called tomorrow all right
periscope is turned off and
it's just us here on youtube so
uh yesterday youtube demonetized
my live stream so
if you were here yesterday and you saw
me yesterday
what was it that i said yesterday that
would cause me to be demonetized
do you have any idea because i don't
so i complained about it on twitter and
youtube's
one of youtube's uh twitter one of
youtube's teams
that has a twitter account noticed it
somebody probably sent it to him
and they contacted me and they said can
you send us the url
of what got demonetized because i guess
the demonetizing happens by
ai so artificial intelligence
demonetized me yesterday the humans
don't know why who's in charge of the
country
think about it the humans don't know why
i was demonetized and told me
they don't know why and they they say
we'll do a human review
which is their their check against the
ai you know being too wild
but let me ask you this if i were not
the dilbert guy
would youtube be checking on that for me
do you think i would get
a full human review if i were not
famous and in the public eye
probably not probably not because they
wouldn't have noticed
my tweet they just wouldn't even be
aware of it
so if i were not famous
artificial intelligence would have
decided whether you could see my content
as much because when it's i think
youtube
denies this but i don't believe it for a
second
and that's the question of whether a
monetized content
is distributed and promoted in the
you know within youtube as much it
sounds crazy to me
that they would promote something that
doesn't have advertising in it
as much as they would promote something
that makes money for youtube
and so i i tend to believe that the ai
promotes things that are monetized
so um that's a little youtube inside
story the good news is that the youtube
team
um was right on it and they're looking
at it
i'll tell you later if they remonetized
it but
here's the scary part i don't have any
clue
what kind of content i said yesterday
that would have even tripped
an automatic ai review
i don't know anything i said that was
controversial
because i i make an attempt to
understand where that line is
and make sure i'm always below it i'm
not trying to exceed that line and get
away with something or
you know push the boundaries or anything
i'm not trying to do anything
i'm trying to play within the rules i i
tend to be the kind of person who says
you know if it's a free country and
somebody says
these are our rules if you want to be in
the system
you know we're all going to play by the
same rules i'm good with that even if
the rules don't work for me
you know because everybody's playing by
the same rules i just don't know what
the rules are
there it's a little ambiguous at the
moment
so that's enough for that and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
you
