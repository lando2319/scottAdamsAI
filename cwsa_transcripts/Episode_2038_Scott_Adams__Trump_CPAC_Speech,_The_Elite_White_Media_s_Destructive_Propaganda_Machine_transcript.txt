good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams it's a
highlight of civilization I know it
doesn't seem like that every day does it
but today is it's a highlight of
civilization and if you like your
experience here to get even better it's
hard to believe but it could actually
get a little bit better all you need is
a cover mug or a glass of tanker Chalice
of Stein a canteen Joker flask
a vessel of any kind thank you Paul
there it's better with a it's better
with a microphone isn't it everything's
better with sound
well
hey join me now for the umbrella
pleasure the dopamine here today
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
ah good save by Paul
on the local community
where we are all supportive of each
other it's a wonderful place
be they white or black male or female
lgbtq or whatever is not that
uh all working together over at the
locals subscription site but let's talk
about the news did anybody watch SNL
last night
anybody
I hear I was on it
so I finally made it to SNL
yeah it was a dream of mine
well it wasn't you know exactly the way
I imagined it but hey I was on SNL and
probably you weren't
so I got that going for me anyway
uh
uh there's somebody who's tweeting for
the the government's National Park
Service that apparently has a sense of
humor and so a number of the tweets from
the National Park Service have been
funny but here's my favorite
um
if you come across a bear never push a
slower friend down
even if you feel the Friendship has run
its course
now that's some good tweeting
that is some good tweeting
uh I think on SNL it was on the weekend
update so nobody played me as a
character
um
oh there's a tragic news today that uh
Trump advisor kellyanne Conway
and husband George Conway announced that
their uh they're going to get divorced
now who's all that coming
all right we're private now on locals
who saw that coming
oh that's right everyone
you know what my theory was
did you all have a theory about what was
going on in that marriage
well it would be hard not to have a
theory right because you'd look at it
you go how does that work where George
insults his wife's boss every day on
television like how in the world is that
going to work
yeah and I had this hypothesis I was
working on that it was uh sort of a sex
game
where where George would insult
kellyanne Conway's boss
and then she'd get home
you know what I mean
and then she would punish him
for being so bad
that's the only thing I can figure out
is that she was a Dominatrix and
nothing else quite fit but maybe maybe
it was boring and it was just a bad
marriage
I would be very disappointed to hear it
was exactly what it looked like
I want I want to know there's some like
whole back story that we'll never know
like something really interesting
but probably not
probably not
uh I asked this question on Twitter
speaking of famous people in the news
if you see a news story about any
political story they haven't heard
before
or something a famous person did
what percentage of the time is it true
and and in context so that you actually
see the accurate picture
it's close to never
now
the funny thing is that because of gel
band Amnesia it's called there's a gel
man I never know how to pronounce his
name but it's either gel band it starts
with a g or a Gill man
um I always say gel
I think that's it but Gelman Amnesia
I've talked about it before it's where
there's something you know about
personally let's say you're an expert in
a field and you see a news story about
it uh and you know that that's wrong
that news story because you're the
expert
but the very next story you read you
think is probably true
and you notice that all the ones where
you know a lot about the story without
the news itself you know the news is
wrong but all the ones where you don't
have any expertise or special Vision you
think well that's probably right
and the funny thing is especially in my
case
because as a public figure there are
thousands of Articles get written about
me over the course of my career and I
get to see how accurate they are
and so Time After Time the story about
me is inaccurate in really basic ways I
mean in this last week the news reported
that I was far right
and also another major news reported I
was a Democrat
at the same week
the major of talking about major news
entities here not not a small Outlets or
anything
so uh how accurate do you think is any
news you have about the conways you know
George and kellyanne not
you know probably there's some story
there that you've never heard and that's
the thing that explains it all
just don't know what that would be all
right I saw this fascinating tweet from
Brian
romelli on Twitter a great person to
follow amazing amazing tweets about all
kinds of stuff but anyway his last name
is spelled r-o-e-m-m-e-l-e
Brian if you search for that he'll pop
up anyway he had a tweet that there's
there was some group of early humans uh
not as in prehistoric but
um you know
well I guess
at least let's see what would be the way
to say it you know maybe around the time
of the pyramids or something like that
but not prehistoric and this group was
uh the Juarez
w-a-r-a-s now I Googled that I couldn't
find it
so I think this is true ancient oh you
say ancient that would be good ancient
peoples and they had genetically
elongated skulls
and we're direct ancestors of the Inca
Elite and they're the creators of the
Andes megalithic constructions in the
lunar andina Dynasty pre and post
deluvian
but if you saw the picture that they're
not Coneheads because the cone doesn't
go straight up it's sort of like from
the Jaw you know sort of more back
but it's like this tall it's like this
giant elongated thing and I look at that
and I think
well at first I think aliens right the
first thing I think is aliens but the
second thing I think is
what if the reason that they could build
pyramids and you know megalithic
structures but nobody knows how to do it
now you know with the tools they have
nobody knows how to do it what if they
were just smarter
what if there was what if there were
some ancient people who didn't have
technology because it hadn't been
invented but they just had huge brains
and they were just like insanely smart
that's totally possible isn't it
you wouldn't you wouldn't see their
technology I think because it weren't it
wasn't long enough that they survived
probably that they could build you know
silicon chips and stuff like that
I I'm I don't I don't think it was from
head binding
I think it was genetic but I don't know
maybe not huh maybe it wasn't yeah you
think maybe it's Atlantis or they they
mated with aliens or something
but I like to just think that there were
people with super big heads that were
just super smart and they they did all
the stuff we can't figure out today
that's my theory I'm going to stick with
it
all right I'll I'll talk about my drama
a little bit later but we'll get to that
um
I came up with a uh a word I coined a
word that I think you might find useful
both at work and on social media
have you ever been in this kind of
conversation where you somebody would
say
XYZ is true and you say no that that was
debunked a long time ago
and then what's the next thing they say
well let's see a link to that where
where is that proof show me the proof
and
here's my new word to dismiss them
as I tweeted today I'm not your Google
 everyone has access to that tool
now the important part is Google
is one word it's not Google space
because I would sound I'm not your
Google
so that would be confusing it's one word
you're a Google no I'm not your
Google
you have you have access to the tool you
can Google yourself
so try it out you might like it yeah I'm
not your Google
um there are blizzards in California
um so apparently to all you Californians
in Texas
hell froze over
am I right
okay I just have to put that one in
there
but when it when you have a snowstorm in
California
and people are not ready because
apparently it's snowing in some places
they're not used to it they've got
blizzards like you know a lot of snow
where there shouldn't be any and people
are running out of supplies they can't
get anywhere there's medical problems
it's pretty bad and I was reading uh Joe
Pollock article in Breitbart today uh
apparently Newsome's on vacation
I guess he declared some kind of a state
emergency or something that might help
and I'm not I'm not entirely sure how
much the government needs to be there in
the snowstorm
but it's notable it's notable because we
talk about you know Trump going to Ohio
and everybody you know everybody thought
that was the greatest thing
this whole business of leaders visiting
um disaster places
it feels like it's just essential
doesn't it
yeah there was a time I used to dismiss
it as just a photo op
you know I thought it was just something
for the benefit of the politician but I
don't think it's for the benefit of the
politician anymore I used to think that
was the only way only reason it happened
oh the president has to get some TV time
to look empathetic
it's good for his voting but I feel like
it's just good for the people
right like if the if the president
visits I feel like
all of the support people who help in a
disaster are gonna up their game like
you don't want the you don't want the
president to hit the ground and start
complaining about FEMA
right you don't want the everybody
coming up to the president saying we're
not getting any help
so as soon as the President says I'm
going to visit I gotta feel like
everybody just like takes it up a level
so it's probably a good thing
um can you believe that I think he's the
top tennis player in the world male
tennis player
Djokovic he can't get a vaccine waiver
request
for the United States still
he's actually banned from playing tennis
in the U.S open
like I thought I was reading news from
the past
can you believe that and then apparently
I think Congress is trying to get an
exception for him and Thomas Massey
accurately points out why would you make
an exception for one person when you
should just get rid of the whole thing
like it doesn't make sense like do a
whole legislation just for one person
when you know it all has to go away
and why would you do it for one person
like if it's a good idea why would you
make an exception
so I mean you don't want to make that
kind of exception in a pandemic yeah
just get rid of it it's it just
it really destroys credibility in the
government at this point the government
is not making itself look good
by keeping this on they might want to
make themselves look good if not us
uh I saw the score on Twitter everyone I
know from hairdresser to the butcher
says that they no longer watch the news
on TV or read the newspaper
now
because I do this and I have an audience
that follows the news
I I am so in my own bubble about what
the average person pays attention to
I like it's hard for me to even conceive
but uh I will tell you that here's a
conversation I have on a regular basis
with ordinary people
Now by ordinary I mean normal
as opposed to Freaks Like Us who are
obsessive on the news and social media
here here's a typical conversation which
I've had a number of times
so you know uh you know Jordan Peterson
right
and then I think I'm going to go on to
my story
and then I get who
Jordan Jordan Peterson so I
what who
you've never heard of Jordan Peterson
no
seriously I don't know how many times
I've had this conversation seriously
you're a living human being in the world
and you've never heard of Jordan
Peterson
and that I can do the same thing with
Andrew Tate
you think everybody knows Andrew Tate
but I've had this conversation all right
so you know Andrew Tate has cancer or
whatever he doesn't that was a rumor
um and people will be like who never
heard of them
you know people who don't know Elon Musk
yeah it's hard to really wrap your head
around what your world is like if you're
not obsessing on this stuff like we are
well why would it be that people don't
follow the news why would it be well if
you saw a tweet by the Rasmussen poll
people today mocking The Economist
and fact-checking them for uh shoddy hit
piece on me
so I feel like The Economist used to be
a respectable publication
but then you see how many facts they got
wrong because you know Rasmussen just
called it out in the article one at a
time
it's just crazy
it's just crazy and and Rasmussen only
called out the errors they made talking
about the poll
like and there's still it was like two
pages with Edison that's not even
starting
the conversation about me and the
article was about me and I didn't read
it of course but imagine how many errors
there were were
misinterpretations I guess would be
better in that
do you do you think anything in that
article and I haven't read it but
besides the the polling stuff that they
got wrong and keep in mind
they got the polling stuff wrong and
they're The Economist
that's the stuff they should get right
you know they should get that right
uh
you bet it's a good read yeah I doubt it
unless you want the truth all right so
the economist and pretty much all the
news about me well let me ask you
for those of you who know the entire
three-act story about me
you know the recent racist rant drama
but only the people who know the full
three Acts including yesterday's video
right now you know that I called it in
advance I told you it was a three act
play and then I delivered all three Acts
now if you've watched the news coverage
but you've also watched B from the
beginning how accurate was the news
about me
go
how accurate was the news about me
in this situation
I'm seeing Zero to 25 percent
yeah maybe 25 percent
nobody's got over 50 yet
so there's nobody who's aware of the
story from start to finish who thinks
that the news coverage in the major
media we're talking about your most
trusted sources
it's completely wrong
now social media is even worse
in terms of their understanding of what
happened but it's not their job to be
right the you the users on Twitter
can be they can be excused
for being fooled by the news which those
of you who know the actual story now one
of one of the things you learned by
watching my story
because I'm so transparent and you've
seen me for a while you know you know
with your own certainty what parts of
the story are wrong
because you've seen me you saw what they
said you can compare them it's pretty
easy
so
you should take that with you to every
other story about anybody who's a public
figure
they're pretty much all wrong
in in wrong in the most important ways
I'm not talking about you got a date
wrong or something like that
fundamentally most of them wrong
now there's some major stories about me
coming out maybe today or or early this
week watch how wrong those stories are
it'll be sensational
like really crazy
uh but fun to watch
so this could be one reason that people
don't watch the news is they don't think
it's real
and and I also think that the reason
that black Americans were way more
likely to say well hold on let's see
what he's saying
instead of jumping to a conclusion Black
America came out really well in this by
the way you know there's a lot of
surprises I guess
but one of them is
black Americans didn't trust the news
so they listened to what I had to say
they're like well that doesn't sound
good
but what are you saying
and then when I said it I would get
completely reasonable responses mostly
right there's always some there's always
some radicals but mostly
people were curious
I explained it
we had a good conversation
and it was pretty good and I I continued
to get invitations from black podcasters
who want to know more
um and I will happily give it to them
so here's a little pattern I noticed now
this is just pattern recognition and I'm
not going to say this is science or a
fact but I want to see if it sounds like
a pattern you've noticed
it goes like this
uh both the right and the left
will sometimes believe things that are
untrue
can we agree on that it's not limited to
one side
we do agree on that right
the both the left and the right can be
wrong about stuff okay but there's
something different about how wrong they
are and why
there's a difference in the wrongness
and see if you've noticed this pattern
that the less untruths are more likely
to be deliberate hoaxes
and the things that the right beliefs
that are not true usually or organically
they came up from other Republicans or
conservatives you know there's usually
somebody who believes something's true
and they put it on the internet 4chan or
Reddit or someplace and then other
people see and they go that's very
convincing I'll believe that too
so that's a real qualitative difference
the the left is actually concocting
hoaxes that are rather elaborate
everything from a hunter's laptop was
Russian disinformation to you know the
Russia collusion hoax to there's a lot
of complexity to keep the drinking
bleach Oaks alive and the you know fine
people hoax alive these are manufactured
hoaxes
you know now the drinking bleach and the
fine people is manufactured in the sense
that it's an obvious uh taking stuff out
of context it's just obviously if you've
seen the context it's obvious how the
hoaxes were done
so
do you see this do you see the pattern
and what it means is that the left plays
elaborate hoaxes on themselves
because although the hoax is meant for
everybody
the people on the right don't believe
them
did you ever believe Russia collusion
but was there ever a moment because most
of you lean right if you're watching
this did you ever think that the labs
that the hog that Hunter's laptop did
you ever think it wasn't real
I never thought that it never even
occurred to me that it wasn't real
of course I thought it was real
so you know I was just guessing
speculating because I didn't know but I
think that the left's lies are as much
about getting the people on the left to
you know conform and vote for them
because I just don't see many people in
the right believing them
so so here's a summary
when the people on the right buy into
some theory that isn't true
they're at least being honest
like nobody lied
nobody lied they just were trying to
figure something out maybe they got it
wrong
but on the left somebody intentionally
got a bunch of people together or they
just knew what to do and they said we're
gonna lie
that's not the same that is not the same
at all
now I know somebody if there were more
people in the left here they'd say what
about those emails at Fox News
to which I say I saw those and all I saw
was that the hosts
respected Their audience and wanted to
give them
topics that the audience wanted to hear
that's all I heard I didn't hear any
kind of
immoral or unethical anything it looked
like they were just trying to figure out
what the audience wanted to hear
which is part of the job
all right how many of you who are
watching saw what I call the Grand
reframe
which was the the third act reveal
for what started as the races rant
and I got really good response to that
really good response because what call
what I the reason I call it the grand
reframe is that it's the one that fixes
everything
at least everything with uh
um everything related to race relations
which are
you we're being driven apart by the
immediate narrative so here's the
summary of it if you didn't see it if
you want to see it with pictures and
larger explanation I recommend it
goes like this
in act one I did my racist rant which as
all observers said Scott
you had to know when you did that it was
going to cause trouble
to which I say
that's why I did it of course I had to
know I didn't know it would be this much
trouble I mean I certainly didn't plan
to get canceled worldwide in Dilbert
which had nothing to do with this I
thought my risk was more like YouTube
would cancel me
right I thought it was like it'd be oh
YouTube banned you so I'll just go over
to rumble
like I thought my worst case scenario
was well just so many videos on locals
and then Rumble instead of YouTube yeah
no biggie but what happened was that it
turned into a political thing instead of
a race thing
if it had stayed within my audience
you you all know my pattern by now I get
you all worked up on something and then
we try to work out work on it kind of a
kind of a thing I do
so if it stayed there it wouldn't have
been anything it just would have been a
provocative thing that once I explained
it you'd say oh I get I see what you're
doing but once it became gigantic the
reason it went from
uh like a minor kerfuffle
to you know national news is because
it's political
and in the end this this pattern was not
obvious at first in the end it was just
white Democrats they canceled me
do you know why I say that no black
Democrats canceled me do you know why
they don't own anything
now that's an exaggeration obviously
right they do own things but in terms of
the the major newspapers Etc mostly a
bunch of white people
so a bunch of Democrats so a bunch of
white Democrats canceled me black
Americans mostly said as I said hey
there's some there's a topic I want to
hear more about
and then
um in the so in the second act is all
the cancellations and the reaction so If
This Were A Movie it would be that the
string of cancellations and you know all
the all the curve level about that
and then if it's a movie and by the way
I call down all three acts before we you
know right at the beginning
the third Act
is where the protagonist of the movie
is in such deep trouble
that there's no way to survive that's
what the cancellations were
so the uh the grand reframe
is the plot reveal
where you find out what this was all
about
and you find out if it was worth it
so basically the hill I decided to die
on is that we have to reject the let's
say the elite media brainwashing that
our biggest variable in 2023 is racial
uh racial division
the only reason we think it's our
biggest variable is because they keep
telling us that now I don't mean that
the elites got in a room and they had a
meeting
I mean that when you follow the money
it's always predictable and the people
who are Elite the rich ones the last
thing they want is for poor people of
all colors to get together and say you
know what
we poor people have a lot in common
so maybe we should change things
and then rich people would get to keep
less of their stuff
but if the rich can keep you fighting
over race
then you think that's the problem and
you don't come from my money
so uh as a rich white guy it would be in
my best interest to keep the racial
division high
but instead I'm going to try to take it
out I'm going to try to kneecap it and
here's here's The High Ground maneuver
which I talk about all the time
persuasion wise it's in the reframe
and the reframe is this
systemic racism is real and by the way
any Republican who says that's not real
nobody will take you seriously what do
you say that
it's not a good persuasion strategy
you should say it's real
and it fits the form of specifically
education is bad for
black people more than other people by
percentage because they're in a deeper
hole
so the reframe is to get away from
arguing about race and working on
personal success strategies
because in my it's my observation
that well let me do this based on a
comic that somebody sent
um I don't know if you saw it it was a
comic about uh
there were two two kids they look like
maybe 10 years old and it was a white
one and a black one somebody who sent
this to me to make a point today but it
made opposite Point than they thought
and the point was uh you see the white
kids standing on the shoulders the black
one
to get up on some ledge and then once
the white one's up there the black guy
says all right now give me a hand and
help me up on this ledge and then the
white guy says
well that would be Reverse Racism
now the comic was supposed to show me
you know about racism in America but
that wasn't the point I got
the point I got is that whoever made
that comic had been poisoned
because the two kids the two kids in
that comic should have been working with
each other if they were both poor
so it should have been that the two of
them would know to work with each other
why why did they not work with each
other
because remember it's these were two
kids in the modern times why would these
two modern kids a black and a white not
work with each other and the reason is
they've been taught not to largely
well and secondly
they should both get together and work
on their personal uh success skills
specifically
now what would happen if the black kid
in that comic and the white kid in that
comic said hey you know it would really
be good if we learned techniques for
Success which are learnable they're very
you know easy to learn
um and then they go out and they get
they get a bunch of success things they
do well in school then they both
graduate
and they go work for a big Corporation
which one can't be promoted because of
ESG
yeah the white kid can't even get
promoted
so if the black kid and the white kid
work together
to increase their personal
success skills and they both got
corporate jobs
the ESG program which is trying to
improve diversely within corporations
would largely guarantee that the black
kid got the promotion before the white
kid
right
Lyle do you disagree
Lyle do you disagree with that that two
equally qualified candidates the point
of ESG is to promote the blackhead in
that situation that's the whole point of
it that's why ESG exists it wouldn't
exist except to do that very thing
there's no other you know there's an
environmental part but there's also the
social and governance part the diversity
part
so even that comic which was trying to
mock me was just a victim of the
narrative it was a black kid and a white
kid who absolutely should have been on
the same side
if they wanted to maximize their their
benefit and it would maximize the black
kids benefit more than the white kid in
that case
all right
um here's uh Dr Joel Brown
he's a good Tweeter
um
and he said Dr Joel Brown is black which
is important to this story
it wouldn't be important otherwise but
it's important to this story any tweets
we need to stop referring to a race of
people as a community
the Black or White Community is a false
category that arbitrarily bunches people
together as a cohesive
interdependent group based on the
relative proportion of melanin In Their
Skin it's a persuasive illusion
perfect
well what is the one thing that when I
talk to any let's say black podcaster or
just anybody on social media who's black
one of the main things that I hear back
is
uh don't think that black people are a
monolith we're all diverse we have
different you know summer conservative
blah blah blah and of course of course
does any believe anybody believe that's
not true is there any group of people
where they're all like
I've never seen one
so it is this is a good point when we
say it's a community what exactly does
that mean
I feel like you're you're averaging
things that shouldn't be averaged or
clumping things that don't need to be
clumped this is all part of the weird
media narrative isn't it we're being
forced to call them communities and they
call each other communities but it's
just the one wrong way to sort of things
if you want to fix anything
well even Joe manchin he's a
right-leaning Democrat but he's saying
ESG will ruin the economy
now he's a uh you know coal guy in a
carbon guy so he doesn't like the
environmental part but anything any kind
of uh
any kind of an outside force that puts a
a drag on a company
could be horrible for the economy and I
think it is
so we may be seeing a turn on ESG
Maybe
I did
so here's remember I told you it's hard
to know what's true when you talk about
public figures do you remember Keith
reneri was ahead of Nexium that
so-called the sex cult
and he got convicted of
um I don't know how much he got
convicted of the cult stuff but the
biggest problem was he got convicted for
some underage stuff so a teenage girl
that was the allegation
now there are seven forensic experts who
confirmed the FBI agents manipulated the
key evidence
the photographs or more than one other
now found on his laptop
so apparently there's evidence or an
allegation based on evidence that the
FBI planted evidence on his laptop
now
when you read the story initially didn't
you just assume he was guilty
he might be I don't know I don't know if
he's guilty or Innocent but I know seven
forensic experts say the FBI planted the
key evidence and that was pretty
important evidence it's not the only
evidence so I'm not going to defend him
somebody always says you apologist no
I'm not defending him I'm describing
that the news about him
I don't think you can trust any of it
yeah the whole the whole sex cult part
of it was completely misinterpreted like
you know because I talked to Nikki Klein
so I had a better idea what was
happening there than the news did
apparently so pretty much everything
about that story was misleading or just
flat out wrong or possibly
fake possibly faked I don't know what
about the Andrew Tate story
we already had cancer but then that
turned out not to be true now last night
Tucker Carlson got into this and he was
talking about how the Tate Brothers have
been held for months on no specific
charges although we've heard all kinds
of allegations and Tucker seemed to
suggest that the real story
is that he pissed off I think the Biden
Administration
and the Biden Administration might have
leaned on Romania to pick him up and now
they're looking for a crime
now I don't know if that's true
I do not know if that's true but do you
think here's a general question do you
think that what we know about the Tate
story is accurate
do you think do you think anything we
know about that story is true
almost impossible it's almost impossible
that that story is true now I'm not
saying that I'm not saying he did
nothing wrong because remember I hate
him personally
I hate Andrew Tate for just personal
reasons not based on what he says
um
but I don't believe anything about that
story except that he's probably in a
Romanian custody but pretty much the
interpretation and why and all that who
knows
who knows he could have got picked up to
be shook down and they're trying to get
his Bitcoin from him could be that the
Biden Administration did something could
be some other country could be an
individual who had a problem it could be
anything but the one the one thing you
can rule out
is the way it's reported
that's the only thing you can rule out
when it comes to famous people you can
always rule out the specific ways
reported that that's definitely not true
we don't know what is true
but that you can rule that out because
it's almost never the case how many
hoaxes have there been about Trump
now I keep an updated list of trump
related hoaxes news about Trump the odds
of it being true are very low
very low
sometimes when it's positive and
sometimes was negative it's still very
small chance it's true or in context
right uh here's something that not
everybody knows
did you know
that if you take a video clip that says
the sky is blue
that you can remove parts of it until it
looks like it said the sky is red
now your common sense says no you can't
do that by subtraction you you can't
change the whole meaning of a video just
by reducing this length you know taking
off some from the beginning of the or
the uh or the end
but here are three examples where
exactly that happened the Covington kids
hoax was a all they they didn't they
didn't alter the video they just clipped
off the part they would have told you
the context
injecting disinfectant hoax same thing
they just clipped off the context
overfeeding koi fish in Japan same thing
they cut off the context
fine people hoax same thing they cut off
as clarification and then it looked like
he
didn't want to clarify
so those are four well-documented cases
where if you said I saw the video I saw
it myself you were completely wrong
I could put comments on slow mode
I didn't know that was a thing I'll look
into that
so YouTube has a slow mode for comments
but then you'll never see your comment
yeah it's sort of a trade-off
all right well so here's my bottom line
of this in 2023 now you could be you
could be forgiven
up until the last few years we're
believing that if you saw it on video
that's all you needed to know that was
the end of the story
but in 2023 anytime on social media you
say something like I saw the video and
there's no other way to interpret it
that sounds dumb
that sounds dumb
now I'm not saying this is like a
generic case you might be right
but if you believe that you're right
because you saw the video that's dumb
20 years ago if you saw the video is
probably accurate
probably
but today if you see a video and you say
no I know what I saw it's on the video
that's it that's just dumb because there
are too many examples where the exact
problem of reversing its meaning just by
cutting off a piece of the video you
don't know the difference
you can't tell
so never ever be dumb enough to say I
know it's true because I saw the video
and there's no other way to interpret it
no other way
just as dumb
um
all right
what else is going on
um I have a theory
that this upcoming presidential election
the most effective campaign video will
be made by a
an amateur
using AI tools
what do you think of that prediction
now there'll be tons of campaign ads
you'll see them most of them will be
standard but I believe somebody will use
AI
to make the most effective campaign
add
and I would further predict that in the
future that's the only kind you're going
to see
because making real ads is pretty
expensive
but if your followers are making your
own ads
some of them might be better than
anything you could have done if there
are enough of them
so that's my prediction there'll be an
AI made or at least aided campaign video
it'll be the best one of the 2024
election
all right how many of you saw Trump as
CPAC give a big speech I note that it
got basically no coverage I think CNN
had one
opinion person talk about it
all right here's my bottom line on Trump
as you know most of you I'm indoor I'm a
single issue voter this time
and my single issue is fentanyl so I'm
liking a Vivek ramaswamy both because
he's he's smart and he's younger I think
we need a younger president but he's
really hard on
on Sentinel now Trump is also tough on
fentanyl but I liked I liked vivek's
focus on it for now anyway so the bottom
line is I'm not currently endorsing
Trump I might
I might later you know if he wins the
nomination and depends who he's running
against blah blah blah but I mean have
you heard that uh
is it uh RFK Jr might run as a Democrat
is that true
is a bit is that like a true rumor
Bobby Kennedy
uh which Kennedy is it
it's our yeah it's RFK Jr right
wouldn't that be interesting
yeah wouldn't that be interesting
because RFK Jr has a real good
reputation on the right because of his
pandemic opinions
I don't know it would be I it would be
an interesting race I think I want it to
happen
I think I want it to happen
only because
if the Republican loses you know you
want your your best choice
on the other side
he might be a really good choice
for for a Democrat you know if you had
to lose to a Democrat wouldn't you
prefer to lose them
I don't know
good because his
his other opinions seem strong enough
that they they seem to be based on
you know
um what makes sense not on politics
all right
um
Trump's trumps came out to the speech
with a video package
so you know they they do the
inspirational video thing before he
comes up best one best one you'll ever
see the video package they introduced
him just made me feel good
really well done probably nobody will
make one that good right then he comes
up to speak
did you see how well he did at that
speech
so here's some observations
number one his age is not showing
at least in that speech his age was not
showing
and he was funnier than usual because he
has more material to work with because
he was President so he does these these
uh funny little stories about
um threatening Putin that he would
eliminate Moscow and then he laughs and
he goes 10 chance he goes 10 chance
that's all it took and he just laughs at
the fact that allegedly you know you
weren't I I don't I don't think these
are necessarily literal stories I think
they're sort of
conceptually directional stories I I
don't know that the details of who said
what are are accurate but these little
stories that you can't you can't know if
they're true or not because there were
personal conversations or this is best
work
as long as you're willing to say all
right I get the idea of what you're
saying but you know the details I'll
accept are Hyperbole and you know maybe
you string some Tales together as
politicians do but just the general idea
of it is pretty strong in his case
anyway so I would say he was hilarious
he was uh he looked
he didn't look like age was a problem
you know I still worry about it as time
goes by
um
he had all the right notes for his base
and I was noting how some things that
he's been saying for a long time
went from things I thought were a bad
idea
to now because the environment's changed
they seem like good ideas let me give
you an example
I hated
that he kept saying criminals were
coming across the border
even though some criminals were clearly
coming across the border it's because
that he was saying in a way that that
made it too easy to make it a you know a
racist kind of thing now anybody who
heard him talk if you know how to
understand words and sentences you know
that he didn't mean every person coming
across the border was a criminal he was
not saying that the babies and the women
all criminals no no he was just being a
little hyperbolic about that is so you
could fill it in with your own brain but
as as unpleasant as I found that when he
first brought it up now when he talks
about it it actually makes sense
because things are so bad now the MS-13
is coming across I I think there's a is
there a verified story of Venezuelan
prisons being emptied
is that a real thing
because he talked about prisons being
emptied so I think this went from
something that sounded
um like a little too close to a racial
comment I don't think he meant it that
way but it was a little too close in
sound
um
now it's something most people would
agree with
now we know for sure
that I don't know how many but way too
many people are coming across the border
so that that's something that sounded
all wrong when he first said it but now
it sounds like what just what's
happening too many criminals coming
across
just if for no other reason than the
sheer volume
would be more criminals
here's another one that I didn't like
make America great again
it's one of the most successful you know
slogans of all time I definitely think
that but I I never liked the Again part
you know because it makes it too easy
for the other side to say what do you
mean back to slavery
but look at it from today's perspective
make America great again
the only way I can hear that is like it
was before the pandemic
right
the the word again has now changed
meaning from Oh you mean back in the 50s
when we were all yeah everybody was a
racist we don't want that
now again just looks like before the
pandemic or before Biden ruined
everything according to Republicans so
so isn't that weird the two of the
things that were his biggest weaknesses
because the situation has changed now
look right on point
I didn't see that coming
did not see that coming
all right
um he made more good points than I want
to mention I would say that if you're
wondering you know what is the strength
of a 2023 Trump compared to 2016 and
2020 Trump
if I based it only on this
he is at his highest peak of ability
this was this was pretty Sensational
actually and when do you watch it
there's a thing you can't get out of
your head
and see if you all have the same thing
in your head when Trump is talking and
he's really on point you know like he
was at CPAC
you say to yourself
nobody could do that better
like not even close
the the way he held that audience
oh my God
I you're Reagan Reagan was a superpower
Obama tanza Charisma great public
speaker in his way
but
I watched practically his whole speech
and I don't really watch political
speeches but I was riveted the whole
time I was like well well that's
interesting oh that's funny well that's
interesting oh that's funny
he kept me he kept me glued to it and
nobody nobody is in his class he's
absolutely operating alone and I'll tell
you the problem was that if you watch if
you'd never heard of trump
and you watched Vivek ramaswamy give a
talk
you know because I hadn't watched a lot
of trump the last few years so I'm
watching you know Vivek and I'm saying
oh my God he's so smart and he's saying
like all the right policies things I
want to hear and I'm thinking oh yeah I
want that
and then you hear a trump talk
it's just a whole other level
yeah now that's not to say that Trump
should be president I'm speaking just
about performance just performance
his performance is unparalleled there's
nobody close nobody's in his class as
soon as you say but but DeSantis gives a
good speech
to say this would disappear
if he stood next to Trump he would just
disappear
you would forget his name
like it I I really I guess I forgot how
good he was but then he has more
material to work from
but uh the the news the major news seems
to be completely trying to hide him
so he's getting no press whatsoever and
I wonder if he can
um if he can perform if his only presses
like this on podcasts and stuff and
maybe
maybe podcasts are the news now
now one thing that I bristled at is that
he once again hit that the 2020 election
uh he really won
and for the longest time I've been
saying that is just bad strategy just
bad strategy forget about whether you
want or not right we're not going to
settle that but it's just bad strategy
to be looking backwards like nobody
wants to hear it at this point
and then I thought of this
the entire Democrat idea for January 6
when they were trying to go after Trump
the idea of it was he always knew he was
lying and he always knew the election
was fair
one way he can make that look like ridic
look ridiculous is by continuing to say
it when it's no benefit to him
whatsoever because I think it's hurting
him more than it's helping him but at
the same time I think to myself when I
hear it I think you know what
I feel like you wouldn't be on it this
long unless you believed it
I can't read his mind right so I'm not
saying I know what he's thinking I'm
saying that my impression of it is that
the longer he keeps on this what seems
like a losing path
the more I think he must believe it
and if he believes it it wasn't an
insurrection
it was exactly what you thought it was
trying to stop one
meaning he actually thought the election
was sketchy and he actually thought that
if you just delayed it a little bit
that it would come out you know you'd be
able to check or it'd be obvious somehow
now I think he was wrong about all those
things
so far I haven't seen any evidence that
I consider credible that that there was
anything wrong with the election that
would change the uh the outcome there
could be remember I always say these
things are not fully auditable they're
not really designed to be fully
auditable so you can't know
but I don't I don't have any counter you
know any information that was fixed
either
so
um there's a thing I do with all of uh
my opinions which I don't think you've
noticed the pattern so I'll point it out
uh if something can't be solved
and there are lots of stuff like that I
default to the best system
so the goal would be to get the right
answer
you know that everybody agrees with but
sometimes you can't do that
take abortion for example you're never
going to get agreement so I default to a
system
that keeps everything running when we
don't agree
so with abortion
I say don't listen to me
the best System since it's life and
death and we'll never agree the best
system is that whatever women want by a
majority is what the law is now it might
be different by state but
um now I'm not saying that men don't
have a right to vote men you do whatever
you want I'm just saying that the system
that's most stable
is where women decide on abortion the
system that's most stable is that where
men largely are the ones who decide on
circumcision
You could argue as some have
and I think this is less true than it
was that a decision to go to war should
be a male decision
because it's the men are the men that
are going to go die but you could argue
that because they're mothers and you
know women women are in the military and
blah blah blah so it's a little less
clean but I I prefer a system
so when I looked at the election claims
I didn't know if the claims of bad
election were true or not
but I was pretty sure that we wouldn't
be able to prove them in any time soon
and in that situation I default to the
system which is I'd rather
get this election over with and just get
on with running the country
so I tend to not quibble about small
goal things although this wasn't small
it was pretty big I I don't quibble
about the goal
if getting that right means you break
the system I like I like the system to
stay strong even when it's giving you
wrong answers because you don't want to
break the whole system
you want to fix it and tweak it
all right so maybe Trump is doing that
as a strategy to show that he really
does believe the election was stolen in
which case that is to me that seems like
a complete defense for January 6.
now I don't think there were any charges
but people are still going to be
accusing them and to me it's a complete
defense
and I don't know if he I have no idea if
he believes it
I kind of think he does
I kind of think he does that would be my
guess but I can't read his mind
all right
um
I made a list of all the racist things I
support
it turns out it's a pretty long list
would you like to hear all the racist
things I support
I support historically black colleges
pretty racist
but the good kind the good kind
I have historically supported
affirmative action although I lost two
jobs because of it
which is not a speculation that's what
my boss told me in both cases your
career is over because you can't get
promoted you're a white man directly
they didn't say your career is over they
said you can't get promoted
um which was the same thing
so I agreed with affirmative action
although I think it needs to be
reconsidered in 2023 because it might be
causing more ill will than it's solving
but so I think it needs to be looked at
but affirmative action is totally racist
and I supported that
Black History Month
pretty racist I don't think we have a
month for all the other groups do we
if everybody doesn't have a month
that's racist and I support it
I like Black History Month
you know to me it's like okay
you know the the black Americans have
slavery they got some complaints yeah
let's have a month let's let's celebrate
some some successes and stuff like that
so as racist but I like it
I'm okay with it
uh I supported Obama for president I
can't remember if I actually voted I
don't think I did but I supported him uh
in in no small part because he was black
because I thought it was just good for
the country I think I was wrong
I may have been wrong but uh but because
he was black
I supported him more
that's totally racist
that's completely racist but
it's the good kind
here are some things I oppose that are
racist on their own
but when you oppose racist things you
are a racist because you can't avoid it
for example ESG is racist because it you
know its preference for
um different races
and I oppose it
if you oppose something that's racist
and it were changed it would be changed
to a different racial you know benefit
and cost which is racist yeah anytime
you do any policy good or bad
that depends on race
racist so by opposing a racist ESG that
makes me definitely a racist I oppose
CRT and Dei
for the for the same reasons
those things at least imply or sort of
nudge you toward racial preferences and
I oppose that I oppose racial
preferences in in this context
um which is racist
that is racist to oppose racist things
because reversing them would just move
the racial
balance a different way
whichever way you move it is racist it's
just sometimes you like it and sometimes
you don't
but very racist
how about lowering College admission
standards for diversity
well that's that's racist
and I oppose it
so because I oppose it and it's racist
if you were to reverse it
it would have a different racial outcome
which is racist by definition
I like strong border security
I like strong border security
which
keeps it almost entirely non-white
people
which is racist it's racist as an
outcome
but it's a good kind it's a good kind
because countries need borders it's not
my fault that the people on the other
side don't look exactly like me but if
it was a bunch of Brits I'd still want
to close the border do you think of a
Great Britain was our Southern border
we're going to let them all come in and
just do whatever they want
like we like Great Britain
but you still got to go through the
Border checkpoint like that's not
negotiable
I'm sorry that's not negotiable
um
I think that some of the people who
cross our border illegally are criminals
I've been told that's racist
I don't think they're all criminals but
I've been told if you say any of them
are criminals that that's bad
and
so there are quite a few racist things I
do I didn't realize there were so many
of them
but there you go
all right
here is a hoax well let's just call it a
reading tip I did not think it would be
necessary to give a reading tip to
adults but here it is
uh if you were to read this sentence
many elbonians drink too much
is that racist
many elbonians drink too much
now because you could say that about
every group couldn't you
right it's hard to think of any group
that doesn't drink too much I mean there
might be a few Mormons maybe that's
about it but you wouldn't say that you
just say oh if somebody said to me many
albonians drink too much I would think
they're trying to help
wouldn't you that sounds like good
intentions oh you know maybe we need to
do something about this many albonians
drink too much
uh so if you see many albums drink too
much somebody might try be trying to
inform you
so it might be odd I'd like you to know
this
but suppose you read this sentence
albonians drink too much
just that albonians drink too much
what do you think of that
what's the interpretation
racist
right all livonians drink too much
um let me so here's the reading tip
the way you should interpret albonians
drink too much if you just some
individual tweets it
um
you should interpret that as too many
albonian string too much and too many
would be subjective right it's this
because it's unhealthy you don't want if
one albonian drank too much
that'd be too much because you would
like that albonian to be healthier
so here's
the two interpretations of albonians
drink too much either
it's a shorthand for there are a lot of
them which would not be racist or
somebody is trying to trigger you
they're intentionally trying to trigger
you that's the other possibility
can you tell the difference
but the interpretation that's never
correct
well it could be
but the interpretation I wouldn't
believe
is that the person who said it really
meant that all a bonus drink too much
so the most ridiculous interpretation is
that the person who said it actually
meant albonians
that's really never the case
that's really never the case there's
nobody who thinks that all members of a
group do the same thing
nobody thinks that all black people play
basketball nobody thinks that all white
people like cheese right just to pick
two weird stereotypes literally nobody
you you could you could go to a crowd of
a thousand people and say all right
question
do you think that all Irish like
potatoes
nobody would say yes
like not literally
nobody
so if you read anything about let's say
black Americans do X
nobody believes that's all black people
nobody believes that
so if you interpret it that way that's
kind of on you
but it's possible somebody was trying to
trigger You by fooling you into thinking
that they meant all
like if somebody said you should move
away from black people
do you think that would mean
everybody should move away from all
black people
who would ever say that
like does that does that sound like a
real thing anybody would say and
actually mean it literally no
it's either somebody means in some you
know in some occasions
sometimes or some situations or
somebody's trying to trigger you
because they know you'll interpret it as
all
that's the interpretation
it either is a shorthand for you know a
lot of them or too many or a lot
or it's just a way to trigger you
but the wrong the wrong interpretation
is that the person means everybody
and on social media
they always go for the wrong
interpretation
it seems like again Europe saying always
but I don't mean always do it right even
I even said the word always
but you should interpret that as not
always
right if you interpreted be saying it
always goes that way on social media
a an adult should take the always right
out of their head and say nobody means
all you it always is hyperbole right so
it's either hyperbole or just a short
end
there might be some exceptions but it's
so rare I've never seen one
never seen one
I saw Elon Musk commenting because
somebody said
that there was something that was
distributed
evenly by ZIP codes some human
characteristic or something
but evenly by ZIP codes and I guess Elon
couldn't handle it it's like the only
thing that's distributed equally by ZIP
codes is the zip code number itself
that's it
there's nothing within zip codes that
are distributed evenly among zip codes
and I thought yeah
yeah he's right
um
[Applause]
foreign
that's funny all right ladies and
gentlemen
that's what I want to say for today if
you haven't seen my uh
my big reveal from yesterday the grand
refrain people are loving it
and it's going to change the world
and I'm going to keep plugging on it
until everybody sees this Frame and then
we'll see what happens
so if I don't get assassinated or
totally
oh if you didn't hear me uh on Sonny
Johnson's Radio Show on Sirius
uh it went really well
so I had a great chat with Sonny Johnson
and uh we had a lot more in common than
I was expecting it wasn't wasn't
expecting that we would hit it off as
well as we did but she's terrific
the new frame is that it's not about
race it's about
the elites are making us think about
race so that we don't join together or
at least the low-income people don't
join together to change things
and vote the same way
you don't want the races to vote the
same way because then the elites will
lose everything
so the better frame is that individuals
should work on their self
success strategies which are not taught
in school
and anybody who learns success
strategies
will succeed
because success is actually a formula
and all the people who succeed use some
version of that formula
all the people who fail some other
version
so I do have a
book that's been canceled but someday
you'll see it sometime this year
probably called reframe your brain
and this reframe isn't in the book
because this is political but the rest
of them are reframes that would make you
more successful
stuff like well you've heard lots of
examples but it's stuff that works for
everybody it's not you know white
specific or black specific it's just
human specific and if you want to change
your life
look for reframes if you don't think
they're powerful I'm going to ask my
audience now and those of you who don't
know watch the other answers has anybody
who's watched me reframe a topic
found a genuine life benefit from it not
just thinking but actually what they do
is different
now the locals people it's just a string
of yeses
the YouTube people haven't seen as many
because I put a lot of them behind the
paywall
but you can see the yeses coming through
also on YouTube right
now keep in mind even though this is a
friendly audience this is people who
came to see me the what they're
answering
is that at some point I said a sentence
that changed their life
all of these yeses are confirming that
at one point I said a sentence a
sentence
that changed their life
the the one you might know about is
alcohol is poison now I don't think I'm
the first person to ever said it but
I've been popularizing it for years and
the people on locals tell me all the
time that they quit drinking because of
one sentence
and the the other the other reframes I
call that a reframe the other reframes
in my book are that powerful
so you'd have uh well over a hundred
sentences that just take your mind to a
different place
and you know exactly you know what's
happening it wouldn't be like hypnosis
or something you know what's happening
and
it would fix uh
it would fix a whole bunch of different
problems from mental health to Career to
social life to everything
so by far it's the most powerful book
I've ever written
by powerful I mean nobody's going to be
the same after reading it it would be
almost impossible to finish that book
with that many reframes and that'll come
out of it a different person you know
and I'm not sure how many self-book
self-help type books could make that
claim but this one this one will it'll
change everybody
I'm positive
that's why I think it might be my
biggest book even canceled even canceled
I'm gonna I'm going to and maybe that
helps you know in a weird way but even
canceled I'm going to predict it's my
biggest book
that's what I think
yeah it's it's insane how good it is and
I don't say that about my other books by
the way I mean I've told you which ones
I like the best and stuff but I've never
said this
this is different this is not like a
book
this is like this is like a
a software upgrade to your user
interface basically
all right uh YouTube I'm going to say
bye thanks for being here have a great
Sunday
and oh um I'll be on Chris Cuomo's show
Monday that's live I'll be there for an
hour and uh I believe it's 8 P.M Eastern
Time
5 p.m 5 PM California
now if you've noticed who I'm talking to
in terms of talking live I'm trying to
pick people
only talking to people that the audience
will not believe is my best friend
because if friendly people talk to me I
what's the point right I want the I want
somebody who's not going to be afraid to
go after it
so because Chris Cuomo is associated
with
CNN where he used used to work most of
the audience will say okay there's
somebody from the left
they're they're not going to give him a
break
so we'll see how that goes
all right so that's your teaser if you
don't want to watch that
I don't know it'll be good could be good
yeah I don't like it when you do the
Frito stuff I don't dig that at all
right yeah you know
for some reason like why is it okay to
do racial stuff about Italians
like why is that okay
that's not okay yeah don't do that you
know I think you think that it's not
that that racially insensitive but maybe
you're not Italian
like I wouldn't like it
if I were Italian I wouldn't like that
at all so don't do that means Free
Speech you can do whatever the hell you
want but I don't recommend it it's not a
good look
yeah it's not cool all right uh watch
that tomorrow and I'll see you then
