hey everybody
come on in gather round it's time for
coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day every single
time
it's amazing what a record we have not
an unbroken streak yet incredible
yeah and all you need to make this an
even better time
is a copper margarita glass of thank
your tells us stein the canteen fly
joker
as i love any guy fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and i'd like to settle
a little mystery yeah there's real
coffee in there
try not to pour it out but you can see
it
oh yeah and i'm really sipping
apparently there's some controversy
about whether this is a fake sip
or a real sip oh it's real let me slurp
it to make sure you know
any questions that's real coffee
and that's my cat boo who has taken a
spa on the shelf
i guess she'll be she'll she'll be
sitting on my shoulder
all right let's talk about
all the important news wow
have you noticed that the news is
dare i say scintillating
yeah i don't i don't get to use that
word a lot but
it's it's just smoking yeah for example
uh
there's a story about the ivy league
cancelling sports
oh oh
the ivy league is cancelling sports the
most
elite gifted athletes
in the country who are not good enough
to play
professional sports obviously but gifted
enough to play in the
ivy league and they don't get to play
this year
here's what i say why the hell do
colleges do
sports i mean it doesn't make sense
anyway right
we're we're used to the fact that
schools and colleges
just include sports and it's a big part
of the whole thing
but why why
it doesn't make any sense when you home
school
do you throw a gym class in there
probably not
um i feel as though exercising and
playing pickup sports is the one thing
you don't
need to teach anybody i mean it's the
one thing people will pick up on their
own
throw a soccer ball in the street and
let them go
anyway i'm anti-school sports and the
reason is it's elitist and it uh
it basically picks winners
and makes everybody else a loser in a
category that nobody should be competing
on anyway
i mean you're the best lacrosse
player in the school oh good for you
the best lacrosse player there's a
valuable life skill you'll take with you
not all right so i don't care about
school sports i guess is the bottom line
i caused a little trouble with the
experts this morning let's talk about
the experts
let me tell you if there's one thing i
can say for sure when it comes to
science and medicine
i would not be an expert can we agree on
that i'm not an expert
could we also agree well
let me get into this the topic is i've
been questioning the
official statistics of how many people
die
from the normal seasonal flu
and the basis of it is that if so many
people die every year from the regular
flu
50 000 ish why don't we ever hear about
it
because we hear about auto accidents
everybody knows somebody who died in a
car and it's about the same number every
year
you all know somebody who died of aids
probably right
you all know somebody who died of an
overdose overdoses are
about the same number a year as the
season the flu allegedly
so why is it the some categories of
death
you all know somebody who died in that
category
but you don't know anybody who died of
the flu
why is that now i asked this question
and what did the experts say
shut up yeah basically
the experts said shut up
now they didn't use those words let me
tell you what some of the experts said
um there was a pulmonary cardiologist
who weighed in
and told me on twitter to stop spreading
false information about
seasonal flu because
did i mention i'm not an expert on
science or
medicine and so therefore
if i ask a question about an obvious
discrepancy between observation
and science if i just ask the question
can you explain the discrepancy
i have become somebody who's doubting
science
and i'm out of my field and so this
pulmonary cardiologist says stop
spreading false information
to which i say wait a minute asking a
question about how to explain a
discrepancy
is that really the same as spreading
false information
well it is if somebody is dumb enough to
look at my question
and then conclude that there therefore
are facts to prove
that the ordinary flu doesn't exist
but i didn't say that did i
i just said there's a discrepancy
something
about what we understand about the world
doesn't make sense
and i would like it to be explained and
it might
indicate that there's something
fundamental that we believe about
something that needs to be adjusted
but the expert the pulmonary
cardiologist tells me that lots of
people have died from the season of flu
and i should stop spreading false
information
which of course is a hallucination
right so the expert comes into the
argument
hallucinating because i didn't spread
that i asked a question a reasonable one
not only is it a reasonable question but
he didn't have the answer
right he didn't have the answer what's
the answer
to the question of why i don't hear
anybody dying of this thing that's
killing
tens of thousands of people a year no
answer
but he's pretty sure i'm that his
hallucination
that i've made a claim instead of a
question
and now he's addressing the claim so
should i listen to the expert
when here's a an obvious case i mean you
don't have to take my opinion
about it you could just look at it you
can see what i said
you can see that i've couched it
consistently as a question
and you can see that he's treating it as
if i said it was a fact
that's a hallucination right
you can see it for yourself so how do i
trust the experts
when i can observe them hallucinating
you don't even have to wonder you're
directly
observing a hallucination i'm not making
this up you could go look yourself
is he the only one who hallucinated this
nope here's uh
here's an or nurse who comes in and says
about my tweet
asking the question rarely have i seen
such a perfect example of somebody
making assumptions
about a subject that is out of their
area of expertise
i can only suggest you talk to someone
who is actually an expert in the field
i'm a health care professional and you
could not be more wrong
do better do better
so starts out by saying uh
that i'm making an assumption about a
subject what was that assumption
can you point to the assumption i made
there isn't one
so this is another expert who says yeah
hey
i'm in this field you're not and the
expert comes in
and then hallucinates literally
literally hallucinates
that i made an assumption i asked a
question that's the opposite of an
assumption i said i don't know how to
explain this discrepancy
can anybody explain it and that turned
into an assumption
that something was not true
so should i listen to this expert who's
hallucinating about my assumption
or the other expert who's hallucinating
that i made a claim
neither of those things happened
right and you can directly observe that
they didn't happen
here's another one rebecca diamond md
says i've cared for two pediatric
patients in my young career
and training and training who died of
influenza
two healthy children two kids
me i cared for them when they were alive
then they died scott adams please come
look parents in the eye
and tell them flu is exaggerated to push
vaccines
okay why would i look people in the eye
and tell them something i i don't claim
why would i do that so here's the expert
telling me i should look parents in the
eye
and tell them something that i'm not
claiming
i'm asking a question
so she's hallucinating again right
this is three in a row experts
who are all hallucinating and not even
being able to understand the question
clearly um
now here's my other question how do
healthy children die
of a seasonal flu
how do healthy children die of a
seasonal flu
now isn't the first thing you would
imagine is maybe they missed something
like maybe they weren't so healthy and
we just didn't know
well one paper that somebody sent me to
explain this
says that actually the the problem in
some cases
and may have been the problem with the
two kids that this
doctor saw is that if you're young
and your immune system has not yet been
challenged
so you haven't developed a healthy
immune system yet
it's something you probably will develop
but you don't have it yet
and then the virus is too much for you
you don't have
the health the the immune system
now what would be a description
of somebody who doesn't have a working
immune system healthy
i mean that is that is the water we use
we would call those babies healthy
despite not having a functioning immune
system
yet because if if everything went
according to plan
they would develop that in time so are
they healthy
it's normal right it's normal
and they are people who would certainly
be healthy
but how in the world do you say that
the flu is what killed them when they
didn't have an immune system
you need both conditions
not one both
so if two things have to happen to to
cause the death
which one's the cause
if i were making the rules i would say
the cause
is somebody lived in the real world
without an immune system
and there's a big risk when you do that
and
one of the many things that could get
you got them
now i can see the argument that you'd
say that that's actually
the the flu but the flu is just sort of
the the way our brains work is just the
recent thing that happened
so it feels like it's the flu but if
you're really looking at what killed
them it's all the things
everything that happened had to happen
just right for them to
have that tragic end so i feel as though
these are people uh both the senior
citizens who die
of it are uh i think in every case
probably compromised from some other
comorbidity
or their general immune system has as
depressed to the point where
a little bit of a typical fluke can kill
you
but would you say that the flu killed
you if you're a senior citizen
let's say you're let's say you're on the
edge of
uh death anyway you're maybe you're a
year away
so it's coming let's say your immune
system started up here
and starts to drop you know as you're
getting nearer and nearer and death
now where it starts out maybe if you got
the flu it wouldn't kill you but the flu
is still the flu
it doesn't change that much right it's
just the flu
but your ability to withstand the flu
decreases and decreases and decreases
until
you don't have an immune system that
could keep you alive
and then you get the flu and you die
would you say that it's the flu that
killed that person
we do but i wouldn't
i wouldn't say that i would say they
died of old age
they died of not having a body that can
live in the real world
because the real world has all these
bacterias and flus and stuff
now let me ask you this how many people
who die of the flu especially seniors
die in the hospital
how many do you think die in the
hospital of the flu probably a pretty
big number right wouldn't you guess
not all or or in let's say a
nursing home hospital or nursing home
probably a lot right big percentage
don't know the percentage
how many of those people get checked to
see if specifically what they died of
was the
seasonal flu none
right they don't check that if you had
some flu symptoms
and you died they're gonna they're gonna
say it was the flu
let me ask you this how many people die
from
a hospital infections and just picking
up
something else in the hospital a lot
a lot makes you wonder
if maybe there's some confusion about
why people die
anyway so um let me ask
let me add this when the experts tell me
hey where the experts listen to me i
like to add this context
number one have you checked my track
record
against the experts because
i certainly understand the concept that
people should not
be talking about you know medicine and
science if they don't have backgrounds
in it
and overruling the experts as a general
statement that's
that's pretty smart right you don't want
the ignorant people
overruling the experts in my specific
case
i'm usually dealing with their thinking
not their expertise you can see in this
case these are three experts who didn't
think well
beyond that one of my early jobs in my
career i was a
bank lender for crocker national bank
and i would approve loans that came in
from the branches
and i was supposed to be the expert who
said whether the loan was put together
right
and whether it should be approved and
for some of those years i worked in a
special
group that focused on doctors and some
other professionals
and why did we focus on doctors was it
because it was a really good market
and they had a lot of money so you want
to have a special group to focus on
loans for a
for a a good group no
it wasn't that it was because doctors
are bad
at repaying loans why are they bad at
repaying loans
because they're not good at business why
are they not good at business
i don't know i don't know
but i know that it was my job to keep
doctors from doing stupid things
literally that was my job to keep
doctors from being stupid
about something in the world you know do
you make enough money
does the risk management make sense that
you could pay back this loan
based on what you project about your
income etc
it was literally my job to keep doctors
from doing stupid stuff
and we needed a whole department to do
it because
doctors in particular did more stupid
stuff
at least financially
so that's some good background for you
and so while the doctor was telling me
that i should not be doubting
because what i was doing is questioning
and doubting so that part is true
i'm a skeptic about the estimates for
regular seasonal flu and
uh so after the experts came after me
uh andres backhouse my favorite
internet fact checker came in and
uh tweeted to one of the professionals
an article from the journal of american
medical association jama
now this is one of the most respected
medical publications right
so this is in the field of the expert
who's telling me
to stop questioning the seasonal flu
numbers
all right so that's what the expert told
me stop stop
stop being out of my field but here's
what the journal of american
medical association said quote from our
analysis we infer that either the cdc's
annual estimates
substantially overstate the actual
number of deaths
caused by influenza
or that the current number of uh
coveted deaths are substantially
overstated
so even the journal of american medical
association somebody says jama is ad
driven by pharma which i don't think
matters too much to this case but it's
it's worth noting and
so here's the expert who was unfamiliar
with his own field
you can see it yourself do you think
that the medical expert who told me to
stay out of this
is familiar that his own field is
questioning exactly like i am
whether these statistics are accurate
right so who who is the idiot here
the cardio pulmonologist or whatever he
is
or the guy who knew that the because i
already knew this
by the way i didn't know from the jama
article
but i was aware that within the medical
community this number is being
challenged
but he wasn't who's the expert
all right um
so here's my uh little mental exercise
for you
suppose there's a bubble boy a bubble
boy is somebody who has no
immune system and he has to stay in this
bubble to avoid
contact with the real world but one day
the bubble boy
decides to sneak out of his bubble he
immediately gets infected by the first
thing that gets him
his immune system can't handle it he
dies what's his cause of death
is the bubble boy's cause of death that
specific infection
that was the thing that finished him off
or was the cause of death having no
immune system and going outside how do
you code that
because it feels like the cause of death
was having no immune system
because if life just going outdoors
kills you i don't know if it was life
that killed you
i feel like you weren't designed to live
within this life
that's what it feels like but i get that
we have to maybe code it differently for
different reasons
all right there's a polish law
that says that the social media
platforms will be fined
millions of dollars if they ban anybody
for
speech that's not listen to this
also illegal under polish law
so in other words the social media
platforms are not allowed
to restrict speech more than the
government restricts it
that's a pretty good law what
how why didn't i ever think of that why
didn't you ever think of it
it feels like exactly the right way to
make a law
doesn't it because what what could be
cleaner than that
this removes this removes
really all doubt now you still have to
argue about
maybe some specific cases that you're
not sure if they
violate you know polish law as well
but i like how clean this is and i think
it would also
require it would push i think the the
platforms
to still carry this offensive speech but
make it easier for
other people to not see it because
at the same time that i think offensive
and incorrect speech should be
allowed for free speech reasons i
certainly would like
a button that i don't have to see it you
know optionally if i can push a button
say
don't show me any of the stuff that's
just obviously ebs
or obviously hate speech or something
like that
so i haven't heard the counter argument
to that
but i like it and i don't even know why
the social media platforms would
disagree what exactly would be the
argument against it
because they do have the ability to you
know wall off
anything they want i mean you could just
say i don't want to have
content from that kind of people and i
think the ai would
figure out how to keep it away from you
by keywords and whatever else
united airlines one of their 777s
lost an engine did you see those scary
scary photos
and i just wanted to add my own
experience because i saw
ian bremmer uh tweeting the other day
about how bad
united airlines service is and i told
you the other
uh not long ago when we i tried to go
for my delayed honeymoon in bora bora
that when i found out the only way to
get there at least easily was a united
flight
i just immediately added four hours to
the trip
because united airlines in my experience
and this is just anecdotal i'm not
making a claim that would
necessarily pass any statistical
check but in my experience
i have there's a technical problem with
almost
every united flight i'm on it's only a
matter of how long they're delayed and
whether they eventually just trade out
the plane
but the number of actual mechanical and
technical problems i've
personally encountered only on united
flights
is really high like the number of united
flights that
don't happen because of a mechanical
difficulty
is scary and here's one that fell apart
in the sky but they landed okay
seen a lot of complaints about the uh
the big spending package that has a
bunch of pork and stuff that the
democrats want and everybody of course
is complaining and saying
why can't we have the line item veto and
all that
and i think the reason you can't have
the line item veto
to get rid of the pork is that you
wouldn't be able to get anything done
i don't think people quite appreciate
that the pork
is a legal form of bribery
which given the other parts of our
system that are imperfect
is sort of the only way to get anything
done you have to actually bribe
members of congress by saying all right
we'll build a
bridge in your stupid state too or we'll
put a military base there if you'll just
vote for this thing once
so the problem is that the politicians
are in this position in the first place
the problem is not that they solved it
the only way that you could
by literally bribing people the problem
is that there is no solution other than
private people as soon as you put in the
line item veto
the people who needed to be bribed
wouldn't vote against it
so the line item in vino doesn't solve
anything it just makes it impossible to
run your
government the way the way it was
designed now you'd have to change
something more
fundamental to make the line of the line
item veto also work
but you can't just toss that in there
and think it solves things
i'm always reminded of this when i when
i see people complaining about
uh the cost of a i know a wrench or a
screwdriver
is you know 400 000 for the space
shuttle or something like that
and and all the people who see those
stories they say what
what a ripoff it doesn't cost four
hundred thousand dollars for
for one screw to fix the space shuttle
they're ripping us off now of course
what the news doesn't tell you
because the news is dumb is that
they're not charging you four hundred
thousand dollars for a screw
they're charging you four hundred
thousand dollars to build a factory that
can build that one screw
because they only needed one and they
don't they don't make them any other way
so i'm exaggerating but the whole point
is that the reason those individual
items cost so much
is you're absorbing some overhead for
creating a system that will make one
device that only works on the space
shuttle right
so the public is never told that there
are actually perfectly good reasons for
why there's pork
and nobody has a reason has a way to get
rid of it that i've heard
and there's a perfectly good reason that
your one bolt
for your space shuttle does cost you
know a gigantic amount of money
there's a real reason for it the news
just doesn't tell you what that reason
is
so you think it's nonsense it's nonsense
that's not exactly what's going on
i feel as though i believe i'm
maybe one month away from the
vaccination
so i'm uh 63
and i have a little bit of asthma so i
think the next
the next layer at least in my state it's
different everywhere i suppose
but in california at least within the
kaiser
hmo it looks like the next wave would
include people like me
now people like me being you have at
least one comorbidity that you can you
know that you can sell
so i think if you add my age which is
below the
the limit that they say is automatic
plus my asthma i probably get the shot
in the next wave now
here's the thing by the time you're
giving shots
to people like me don't you have
really 95 of the people who are going to
die from this thing
i mean without the vaccination that
would have died
because i don't feel like i would die
from covet even with a comorbidity like
my odds would be pretty small but but
far bigger than other
people in theory right because of the
comorbidity
but if one month from now i'm going to
be vaccinated and let's say it takes a
few more weeks to kick in
i think we're almost there because you
don't really
need the young people to be vaccinated i
mean
might be nice but you don't need it
in order to to get to the end so i feel
as if
we're we're really like one month
plus a few weeks for the vaccine to
catch in
we're close now yeah you can you can
smell the end of this thing
even though i know it's you know the
mask wearing and stuff is going to
linger
seemingly forever but the but the real
dangerous part
the part with the high mortality is the
part where you have to close all your
businesses
the part where you have to close your
schools i feel like we're close now
so i hate to quote that
you know bad movie but stay alive
stay alive just a couple more months
you can do that we're almost there
and when we're done with this thing and
we will be done with this
it does have an end we will be
the the generation that lived through it
and we'll have something in common that
that forever will bond us
and i feel like we could be quite proud
of this
despite you know the massive amounts of
deaths despite all the mistakes made
i feel like as humans
we should be proud of this and we're
almost there
so hold on stay alive uh do a little
social distancing
between now and then and i think we got
this i think we got it
all right um
michael jay who's on saturday live
using a little bit of hot water as they
like to say for making a joke about
israel
which as you might imagine is being
called anti-semitic
here is the joke he made use your
judgment
should he apologize for this joke he
said quote
israel is reporting that they vaccinated
half of their population
i'm going to guess this to the jewish
half said
jay is that anti-semitic
my ruling is no no it is not
anti-semitic
it is definitely uh a criticism of
israel the country
that's obvious but here's my problem
with it
it's not a good criticism on this topic
because this is one of the topics where
israel set the standard
basically not only did they set the
standard for
fairness because they really really made
sure
that they weren't doing what he's
alleging
israel did not do that they did it right
they made sure that the palestinians and
everybody else
got the same access right with no
difference
and then they were transparent and they
gave more shots than anybody faster
so anything you say about israel and
vaccinations
if it's not a compliment you're
uninformed all right now should michael
che
apologize for being uninformed
maybe maybe but i don't think you should
apologize for being anti-semitic it
doesn't look like that to me it looks
like a
statement about a country that
you know and if you said does he have a
point that historically
israel has treated israelis better than
they treated palestinians
that's an argument you could have and if
michael j's
comment is really about the history
of israel maybe being more harsh to
outsiders than themselves
or even more harsh to anybody but the
jewish people within israel you could
have that argument
but i think it's an inartful joke
because any comment he made about
israel being unfair in the past it
doesn't apply to this situation
you know even if you think there's a
good point about the past or some other
situation
it just doesn't apply to this and and
saying it i think is bad
for israel for for the world really so
here's my take on this
i don't think he owes anybody an apology
for being anti-semitic because it wasn't
in my opinion
right it's a judgment call in my opinion
it wasn't
but um it wouldn't be bad to issue a
clarification
and if he did i would just i would
accept it immediately under the 48-hour
rule
and i think a clarification could be you
know i'm talking about the country
and and his history didn't mean to say
something about the vaccinations
specifically they're doing a good job on
that
that would be fair right would you hate
him if he said that
i think that would be a perfectly
reasonable polite thing to say
you know he he probably went a little
too far on that joke
but it's a joke you know i don't think
people
should lose their jobs over uninformed
jokes if they did i would have lost my
job a long time ago
because i make some uninformed jokes
somebody says let the jewish people
decide
i don't know if that standard works do
you let other people decide
that you've done something bad and
therefore you must be punished in some
way i don't know it's not a good
standard
it wasn't even a funny joke somebody
says
yeah it really wasn't was it
all right i i've been seen in the in the
comments today
a number of you saying hey move on
you're talking about that topic too much
and you're not wrong have you noticed
that the news got very uninteresting
but it turns out that trump maybe i
guess he's going to give
a speech as cpac he's back
and people are calling him the
presumptive you know
leader of the republican party well i
don't know if that's the case
but i would say he might be a king maker
so i don't know if he's going to run
again
but if there is somebody running that he
favors
whoever that is is going to be a strong
candidate right off right out of the
right out of the gate so
um somebody says read other news sources
because there's more interesting news is
that why
um here's the thing i worry about
i don't believe that this country has
any leader anymore
do you because biden is the president
but he doesn't feel like a leader per se
it's something about biden and you don't
think he's going to be there that
long et cetera kamal harris would be the
president
if if he were to leave office but we
don't she doesn't have
that leaderly equality you know the
charisma the trump thing
the the bill clinton thing the obama
thing right
there there are lots of people who have
that charisma and
we don't have one on the left or the
right you know i've said
aoc someday but she's not quite seasoned
up to
up to be ready and i feel like this is a
dangerous situation
because if a um if a charismatic
character with bad intentions emerged
there's not much to stop them is there
we don't have competing leaders right
now we're
we're basically leaderless aren't we
i feel like the news and social media
is sort of like pushing things and then
the leaders are just sort of responding
to things
but there's no leader leader yeah i see
people mentioning desantis
in florida and i think he's doing a good
job as far as we can tell
but he's still more of a state leader
he doesn't have a national and and
desantis i don't know if his charisma is
big enough
that makes me question whether he could
take the next level up to
national office there's a there's a
charisma
issue if you were to look at charisma
you're looking at aoc
you're looking at matt gates right lots
of charisma
know if you don't like his policies or
whatever but he's got lots of charisma
um at least there's that so i think
we're a little bit exposed
i i would worry that some evil leader
could emerge
uh dave smith is taking over the
libertarian party
well that could be interesting
all right uh candace owens somebody
mentioned
candace would be so much fun no you're
right i think candace owens is
uh if you talk about charisma she's
she's got all the charisma but i haven't
seen her looking like she wants to run
for national office
if she did she'd be a she'd be very
interesting
yet josh uh josh hawley is
really good on tv and he's got that deep
voice and he's really
smart you know he's i think he's a
harvard guy right
but he seems a little closer to
traditional
politician with good hair and a good
voice
he doesn't feel like the special one
yeah i don't know is candace old enough
i don't know
don't know what her age is she seems too
young
both because she'll be even more
seasoned later so
somebody says tim scott he could be
interesting i don't know if he has the
charisma
again christy gnome she's got charisma
but she also doesn't have a big national
profile yet
all right um that's all i got for now
let's hope that tomorrow
will be better and more interesting news
if you haven't seen my
uh video my micro lesson that i did
that's
that's pinned to my twitter feed you
might check it out
i'm teaching you how to find happiness
and the meaning of life or at least how
to get on the path to
having those things for some of you it
will be the most important thing you've
ever seen
i don't know a percentage not most of
you but for some of you
it will actually be life-altering
so i recommend it it's worth two minutes
of your life
and that is all for now talk to you
later
all right youtubers
and just looking at your uh comments
right now
this is the best part of the day
can biden handle the state of the union
yeah sure you'll be reading it
when is the state of the union it's
pretty soon right
or is it maybe they don't do it the
first year they probably do it
after the first year
wait what'd you say about me scottish
scott adams has the charisma but he is
too selfish
you're correct i i agree with that
criticism
no but i would also be you know
destroyed like anybody else
now let me let me tell you how i would
handle the
the reputational problem because if
you're an artist and you go into
politics you've got lots of things
you've said
that people are going to dig out and
have fun with
and i think what i would say is just
assume that everything you've ever seen
about me is true
unless it was something illegal and then
assume it probably wasn't true
but anything that somebody said about
you know bad
character or decisions or bad social
life or personal things just
assume it's all true and then make your
decision
because if i couldn't offer you
a form of leadership that you would
still prefer
even if you knew i said that offensive
thing 20 years ago
i probably shouldn't be president right
if i can't give you a good enough
package
to overcome the fact that i said that
thing 20 years ago with a defendant
somebody
i shouldn't be president so now i
wouldn't worry about that i just say
believe it all
most of it won't be true the the murray
gelman
theory tells you most of it's not true
but i'm not going to spend my time
saying oh yeah okay that one was a
little bit true
and that one was out of context and you
know that one's just a complete lie
just assume it's all true and then make
your decision
i'll i would still be better than the
competition
all right um somebody says candace will
be
35 and 2024. that's convenient
somebody says i don't like that you
abandoned trump did i
did i abandon trump
i don't think that's a fair
characterization i think that from the
beginning
i've always said what i liked about him
and what i didn't like about him
what changed that never changed
there was never any time when i said
everything about him is good
and everything about the other people is
bad i've never been that person
so if if the last thing that you know
he's famous for for being in office was
the capital assault
that's not my fault that
that's in the news i didn't do that
all right um
somebody says i personally feel like
we're the people who have been
abandoned that we're the you mean the uh
the base yeah there's i would agree with
you on that
and that's all i got now i'll talk to
you later
