do do
do do do do do
do do
so I just noticed something when I went
into my little drawer I always go into
I don't know why but there was still a
mask in that drawer I don't I don't even
keep them in there I don't know why it
wasn't there but are you finding masks
like old masks
sort of in pockets and closets and
drawers everywhere and every time you
see one doesn't your doesn't your heart
just like Drop it's like oh God no
garbage
all right well welcome to the highlight
of civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and aren't you glad you're
here well you will be in a minute and
all you need to take this experience up
to levels that nobody's ever seen before
is a cup or a mug or a glass a tanker
cell assistant a canteen jerk of flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dope means the other day
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous it happens
now go
ah
well Summer's here whether you like it
or not
at least where I live it's all warm
weather from now on
for the rest of time all right let's
talk about the news
um
it's funny when you when you associate
with people who have become experts at
interpreting the news
versus before I started talking about
politics and being on Twitter I thought
the news was sort of the news
yeah silly me I thought that if it was
on the news it was probably important
and they looked into it then they told
me the facts now now what I see a story
on uh that 60 Minutes is going to do a
big piece on Ray Epps and how innocent
he is and unfairly accused of being a
Fed
do you feel the same
do you look at that story and say to
yourself well there's a useful story in
which 60 Minutes will give us the
accurate details as they have researched
it
is that is that are you not anymore huh
yeah yeah it seems like those days are
over yes
um now when we see that 60 Minutes is
covering the ray up story it looks like
nothing but a Democrat up
it's an OP it doesn't even look like the
news
like I I can't even
I can't even like force my brain to see
it as a legitimate news story
is purely narrative
um manipulation
now let me say as clearly as possible
I don't know what I don't know what's
going up with going on with raps
I do think he's innocent until proven
guilty
innocent until proof and guilty I'm
going to stick with that standard as
long as I can
so I don't assume he's guilty of
anything
I just know that the story is very
anti-democrats winning the presidency
and if Biden can't sell this January 6th
thing he doesn't have much to sell
because otherwise he's just not looking
good compared to you know Trump's
performance on a lot of stuff
so they got to do something so to me it
looks like 60 Minutes is just being a
good Democrat and trying to take the
steam out of the rayaps accusations
be they too or be they not I wouldn't
know but innocent until proven guilty
innocent until proven guilty
all right uh likewise here's another
story that I'm not seeing as just news
so NBC is covering the charges against
uh Hunter
and I guess candelanian is one of the
people in the stories one of four people
on the story
and if you don't know
The Glenn greenwalds Etc like to accuse
NBC of being part of a CIA operation
basically
and
so it's curious why are they covering
the hunter is being
considered for four different charges
and the investigation was done over a
year ago
so even NBC is reporting that people are
frustrated that charges have not been
brought because the investigation's been
over for a long time
now what's going on here
what's going on
are they are they really just covering
the news
because it is the story as far as I know
the story it looks accurately told
compared to other news entities
so why would NBC
that we suspect is not just a news
organization
why would they report this this way
because it looks like it's useful fair
and bad for Democrats why would they do
that
well one of the things you need to do is
catch up with stories after they've
passed you
so in order to remain a news entity or
for people to even think they're a news
entity
um
they uh
I have to laugh at this government in
all caps mahad is saying Scott you are
still talking about Hunter Biden's
laptop LOL
do you think Andre Biden's laptop is not
newsworthy
because NBC thinks it is
you know who else thinks is newsworthy
today
every major news organization
all of them
all right uh that was a good try there
here's here's how I interpret NBC
covering it
they have to cover it because the cat's
already so far out of the bag that if
they don't cover it at all
you won't ever listen to any
they have in the future
so basically they have to catch up to
the truth once the truth is Thoroughly
understood
because then they can lie to you more
effectively in the future because you'll
think to yourself well they covered the
news up till now
so probably this next thing they say is
the news too instead of just an
operation
um so that's what it looks like so the
the two big news stories today neither
of them look like a real news
even though they might be accurate I'm
not saying that the news is inaccurate
I'm saying that the reason they're
covering it and why they're doing it now
and the way they're doing it has
everything to do with manipulating the
voters and nothing to do with the news
that's what it looks like but that would
be speculation because I'm not a mind
reader not a mind reader just tell you
what it looks like
all right uh Wall Street editorial board
is uh taking a big old crap on Randy
weingarten's uh head so she's added the
big teachers union and
she has been opposed to collate locating
charter schools in public schools did
you know that was a thing
I just learned about this today
apparently there are a number of public
school facilities that plenty of extra
room
and charter schools are also publicly
sanctioned Schools they're not private I
don't know if they can be but a charter
school would be something the the
government is supporting as opposed to
something that's a purely private school
so the charter schools say
hey why can't we use some of that
publicly funded
excess public school building
and other people say yeah why not
perfectly good idea you know it's
already public it's already public it's
already paid for it's empty and all this
is public too so put the two public
things in the public facility
do you know who's who uh opposes that
idea
Randy Weingarten because anything that's
good for black people she seems to
oppose
I don't know if that's a coincidence but
there's a pattern that seems pretty
pretty clear that anything that's that's
good for school choice she seems to
oppose now it turns out the story that
you know got the Wall Street Journal uh
editorial board on is that there is one
exception
and the one exception is apparently
there's one charter school that the
teachers union have some control over
and they want that one to be co-located
so she can't even be consistent with her
own preference as long as it's good for
Randy Weingarten
she's for it that seems to be the Only
Rule
now
how in the world does she keep her job
I I guess she's she must do a good job
for the members according to their
opinion because she has to be voted in
right doesn't she have to be voted in
there must be some ballot stuffing going
on or something no she's probably doing
a good job
for the members
but unfortunately that seems to be at
the expense of children and especially
at the expense of black kids more so
than others I think
so in terms of if you're looking for the
source of systemic racism well it's
everywhere but the school system is the
worst and the teachers union is the
biggest cause of that
all right
um
you know there's there's a thing that
the Democrats do consistently
that every time you see it you just
shake your head you go seriously
seriously
that's your idea here's another one
there's this new rule going into effect
May 1st that home buyers with good
credit
uh will pay 40 dollars more for their
good credit
to help fund the people with bad credit
so the people with bad credit can get
houses just like people with good credit
so
I don't even have to tell you what's
wrong with that right
if you reverse
uh rewards so that you get rewarded for
bad credit and penalize for a good
credit
that would be more of what the Democrats
do everywhere which is ignore the human
incentive and motivation variable which
is the big one
right it would be you know it would be
understandable if there were some small
variables that got ignored
but not the big one
why would you ignore the biggest
variable which is how people are
motivated that's how they're going to
act they're going to act on motivation
and money works every time
so you could say to me well these are
small amounts but it's all part of the
same system of penalizing the successful
and
um
and given rewards to the people who
didn't do the right stuff
write stuff according to getting better
credit
uh what's that
all right
so would you also say that the rule is
racist
is that rule racist
who do you think are the people with the
high credit
on average it's going to be white
Americans and Asian Americans Asian
Americans right
so the white Americans and the Asian
Americans will pay more for their good
credit
and who do you think will be the
beneficiaries
largely black people and people of color
with low credit lower credit
so why is it not racist
it's not racist
here's the problem 100 of the things
that the government does
are racist do you know why because it
cannot be there there's not an option to
be non-racist everything the government
does has a disproportionate effect on
somebody
I'm not saying it's all bad it might be
exactly what you wanted but there's
there's nothing they can do that doesn't
disproportionately affect people because
you know well it's obvious right
anything you do is going to affect the
rich people or the poor people in a
different way they're more of one type
in each category so therefore there's a
racial component to literally everything
I'm going to tell you about my
fascinating conversation with a member
of black lives matter next because it
fits perfectly into this thing
all right so this was a user who just
calls himself Huey P's student
10 point PG that's his name on Twitter
and he he looks to be identifying as
black and he's got BLM in his he seems
to be a black lives matter supporter
so there's a
a little battle going on among some
various black I guess activists would do
the right just people who were active in
trying to make things better I don't
know if activist is a is a fair word
because sometimes people are just active
trying to make things better
so he would be one of these people who's
active trying to make things better in
the way that he's the way he thinks will
work
and he got into a debate with I think it
was King Randall which is actually his
name I think his first name is actually
King
uh do you follow King Randall on Twitter
you should
you should because he's he's a
contrarian in the sense that his major
theme is you work on the individuals and
the education and the parents and you
really work on the people specifically
and if you can get the people to be more
effective then they can blast through
the you know whatever racism there is
because there will always be racism
right you can work on racism but it's
still going to be there so King Randall
has more of a personal responsibility
kind of a take on it and he's apparently
he's got a school that's privately
funded that's primarily I think it's
primarily or only for black kids I don't
know but it seems to be working and he's
working with the parents of the black
kids and
I I can only tell from what he tweets so
I don't have personal information on the
ground but it looks really strong
as in it looks like exactly the right
mindset to be promoting and it looks
like he's getting some traction on that
so
so there's a debate between
some of the black factions who say you
know work on education and just make
everybody as effective as they can and
that's your best play and the others who
think is more of a systemic problem and
you should be putting your emphasis on
the system
more than you know now everybody thinks
both are important just to be clear
everybody thinks you should work on
individuals to make them successful
everybody thinks there's systemic racism
of some kind but there is a difference
in what you emphasize you know do you
emphasize one versus the other so
um Huey P student that's his Twitter
name
got into a little back and forth with me
on this stuff I'm back in King Randall
his view of making individuals as
superpowered as possible and that's your
that's your best play in the long run
even for getting rid of systemic racism
imagine if tomorrow
every black student started over
performing
every other student
just you know as a mental exercise
don't you think systemic racism would be
a lot less in a generation
it would kind of take care of itself
success and money are the two things to
solve almost everything you know did did
O.J Simpson before he got in legal
troubles did he have a big problem with
being black
no as as OJ used to say I'm not black
I'm OJ because once you're successful
then you've just seen as the successful
person you know your your race just
becomes a secondary thing
so that's you know reasonable way to
play it
is just to make yourself successful
so
um I got into this conversation with
this black lives matter
activist type of guy
and
he started he said don't you think you
should you said this in a tweet to me
don't you think eradicating racism is a
good place to start
to make everything better what do you
think of that statement
don't you think eradicating racism is a
good place to start
my answer to that was that's the dumbest
place to start
that's the dumbest place to start that's
the worst thing you can do
you know why
how do you ever get to the second step
where's the second step
if your first step is literally
impossible
how do you get rid of racism that's not
going to happen you could reduce it and
we all agree to do that I think a
hundred percent of us say Well yeah if
there's something you could do to reduce
racism of course why wouldn't you
but as a first step
that's the that's the worst advice of
all time and I've heard some bad advice
so
I said no that's actually the dumbest
place to start that is the dumbest place
to start
the first place to start is making
individuals more successful
you know making sure education is
working for everybody making sure people
have a strategy and
um
so this is uh this is what I get back
so you're saying that black people
should just accept unfair treatment and
not speak out
what's that
what's that called
so you're saying that black people
should just accept unfair treatment and
not speak out
yeah it's the so tell it means he's
already lost the argument and he's
starting to have cognitive dissonance
all right because nobody can disagree
with the statement they're working on
racism first is a bad idea
compared to working on yourself first
and also working on racism but that's
that's got to be the background you know
effort for society not for you
necessarily as an individual
so
yeah so he's already off the rails
um should not affect so what do I say
about fairness let's say your goal is
fairness and he's used the word Fair a
few times what do I say about fairness
I've said this forever
fairness was invented as a concept
concept of fairness so that children and
idiots would have something to argue
about
because smart people don't argue about
fairness
they just don't
it's only a dumb person argument because
the dumb people don't have any anything
else to say
so they're like well it's not
well what do you think it's not uh Fair
it's not fair
right because you can make fair mean
anything you want so it's sort of how
dumb people and children argue it's not
fair now in the real world there are
plenty of things that we would all agree
are not fair
and sure
try to do something about it but again
it's not where you start
right where you start is with the
individual you also try to get something
that feels fair over time
but that's not that can't be your focus
if you want to be successful all right
so what do you think he did then so then
I
um I think I said something about using
strategy instead and I said that for
example
uh a a black person who is qualified has
a big advantage in a Fortune 500 company
getting hired now what do you think the
black lives matter Advocate said
when I stated this what I believe is a
fact that a black applicant with good
credentials would have a big advantage
in a Fortune 500 company what do you
think his response was
he said I'm lying
I'm lying and it's a lie that white
people tell all the time
and then he showed some research to show
that there's plenty of racism in hiring
in Corporate America
do you see what he did that wasn't my
argument when did I argue that racism
doesn't exist
I never said that when did I say it
doesn't exist in hiring and when did I
say that there are no black people being
discriminated against never said that I
assume there's massive discrimination in
hiring I would assume that if you're a
black applicant and you go to a Korean
grocery store I'll just pick one random
example you probably have less chance of
getting hired than if you were a Korean
just guessing I mean I'm not blaming
anybody in particular I'm not blaming
the Koreans or anything like that I'm
just saying in general
a small family business is going to be a
little bit more discriminating
than what I said did I say every big and
small company prefers black people no I
said a Fortune 500 companies
specifically the ones everybody's
watching carefully are are starving
for more diversity because they have to
answer to that Master right they can't
not do it
the big companies have to try hard to
get you know black and female and lgbtq
they have to
so
that and by the way that I call this the
uh you know the black lives matter well
I've showed you this before that if you
defeat an argument that's that's just a
terrible argument they always Retreat to
the next obvious level of Defense then
the next obvious one the next obvious
one you just keep mowing the lawn until
until you get down to the last argument
and then it's just an insult right was
it what's the last argument the last
argument is a personal insult do you
think you went for the personal insult
of course he did he decided that the
real problem is that I said a racist
thing uh and he wants to talk about that
now
well what about my argument
and so I pointed out that
um
that I had four instances of losing
careers for being a white male
now you know all four right two
corporate careers where my boss has told
me in direct words we can't promote you
because you're white and male direct no
nothing beating around the bush told me
to my face directly can't promote you
you're white and you're yeah and you're
male
now
my
um debate partner here
says that that was anecdotal
it was anecdotal that I lost four
careers in a row for being a white guy
four
the the other one was my uh animated
cartoon
which I wasn't fired for being white but
it was a comic about a white guy and
they decided that Monday night was going
to be the African-American comedy night
so it didn't fit in its time slot and
once you lose your time slot you're
you're kind of screwed that's what
happened to us
so it wasn't direct but had I been
African-American I would have still had
a TV show
and likewise when I got canceled from
cartooning a hundred percent of people
agree that I've been black I could have
said anything I wanted
everybody agrees with that
you know I wouldn't have been canceled
if I'd been black so
those are four examples just with one
person
just one person
now
his response was that was anecdotal
and my response to that was
I don't I also agree that anecdotal
evidence is not persuasive
here will be the one exception
if it's a hundred percent of the
anecdotes if it's a hundred percent
and I said just talk to any white male
who works in a Fortune 500 company
anyone 100 you'll get 100 common
experience for the last 30 years nobody
will have a different opinion everybody
will have the same observation and the
same lived experience now only the white
males other people are not going to be
you know uh up on what their experience
is but I do believe in anecdotal
evidence when it's every piece of
evidence
every single piece right
you know you don't think that oxygen is
poison
because a hundred percent of humans seem
to be okay breathing oxygen nobody's
ever died from breathing oxygen
so do I need a study to find the oxygen
is good for people
not really because a hundred percent of
every human being ever needs oxygen I
don't have to study that one
all right
but so
as is often the case once I clarified
that I'm unfortunate 500 companies
didn't make any difference it just
turned into a personal insult but I'd
like to introduce a new a new form of
insulting
narrative wordplay
I call it
black words of thinking black words
thinking and there's a tendency for the
let's say the black lives matter types
with that mindset to be looking
backwards
in a black context
and that black words thinking will never
compete against Forward Thinking so if
you think you're going to compete
against the Asian Americans by looking
backwards
or blackwards it's not going to work
if you think you're going to compete
with white Americans by looking black
words and complaining
good luck
good luck you're not going to be
competitive you don't have a chance
now
did I say anything about racism not
existing no systemic racism is real
we should definitely take a look at
doing whatever we can wherever we can to
minimize it absolutely I'm 100 on board
but you should worry about your own
future
as your primary concern and there's
plenty of people who help you
plenty of people to help
you know if if you're a serious person
who wants to seriously succeed find any
other successful people and they will
all help you
there's a little trick for you there's
one you didn't know
successful people love to help
people were not yet successful
with this with this one caution
only if you look like a good bet
you know what makes you look like a good
bet
mindset and character
you get that right
you get your mindset and your character
right search out a successful person and
say I want to be like you can you teach
me how to do this the answer is going to
be yes yeah I can teach you that yeah
having a job you look awesome
yeah is the being successful is strategy
it's knowing what works and what doesn't
and then putting together the things
they work and then executing it works
basically a hundred percent of the time
right nothing's 100 but you know what I
mean basically 100 of the time
good character
learning how to succeed or showing the
mindset that you're trying to learn how
to learn how to succeed all those things
are just gold
right those things will will be good but
looking looking at your past injustices
and then talking continuously about how
they're holding you back don't want to
be around you
now my conversation with Hue ep's
student here
turns into him saying but then I I saw
in the news that you said uh you should
move away from all black people to which
I responded
you still believe the news
that's really the best response you
really do you think do you think you
heard the context of that
do you think you understand what I said
and why of course not
anybody who still says they believe the
news about a story about a public figure
you have some explaining to do not the
public figure
you have to explain why you're so
 dumb that you think the news
about public figures
has a good chance of being accurate and
in context and complete right you got
some explaining to do if you believe in
the news
that's
yeah I know it's I know who Huey P is
so
um
so then he said blah blah blah you think
white people should move away from black
people and I corrected them and I said
I said that white people and black
people should move away from you
because you have a corrosive mindset I'm
paraphrasing I didn't you didn't use
those exact words but the point was yeah
black people should move away from you
black lives matter supporter because
you're bad for them
you're taking them down the wrong path
yes absolutely white people and black
people should move away from this guy
and anybody who has this mindset be they
white or black get the hell away from
that you that you can't if you can't fix
them and it's pretty hard to do just get
some distance you don't want to be
around anybody who thinks you're the
problem
all right
um so I'm sure that my last tweet will
just make him hate me for some reason
okay the abortion pill let's talk about
that
so the Supreme Court in a mysterious
ruling uh uh let's see they
granted the requests by the blah blah
blah to intervene so that earlier judge
had stopped the abortion pill from or
tried to stop it from being available
Supreme Court took it up and they said
no you can't stop it from being you
can't stop it from being available
so that means it is available so the
Supreme Court has ruled
somewhat confusingly
that you can have access to your
abortion bill
now
let's do a little uh speculating here
because we can't read their minds are
you surprised that a conservative
majority
came up with that ruling are you
surprised
no not surprised okay now is that
because you believe that the
uh conservatives are more literal and
therefore it's not political
rather it is really just
um
yes okay
so I'm not sure I completely buy into
that but I see where you're going with
that I get your point you know the the
people who are trying to be literalists
in theory
you should trust them over someone who
doesn't say they want to be literal
or what do they call originalists right
the originalists as an interpret the
Constitution the way it was originally
meant to be interpreted
so I can see why you trust them a little
bit more I I have the same feeling by
the way right although I don't identify
as being a conservative
I would buy the argument that the people
who say let's not
let's not make up our own laws let's
just interpret the Constitution by its
original intent
that feels reasonable
you know I've always respected that
point of view
so
here's what I think
here's the weirdest part of the story
um let's see there was a justices
Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito
publicly dissented
the votes of the other justices were not
disclosed
huh does that mean that the argument
will not be disclosed as well
can somebody give me a fact check
are we going to see not written
arguments from the majority as well as
the minority
or does that come later
yes since when do you not disclose who
voted for what this is really sketchy to
me
I'm going to speculate you ready
speculation coming
I believe that the Supreme Court
has two
competing
let's say objectives
objective number one is to properly
interpret the law according to the
Constitution
we'll agree with that one right
right the other one well maybe three
credibility is related to the second
thing I'm going to say the second thing
is to keep the country from being
destroyed
now nowhere does it say that's your job
right there's nothing that says as part
of the Supreme Court make sure that your
decisions do not rip the country apart
it doesn't say that anywhere
but
they are humans
they are humans
they are citizens
there are people who presumably care
about their country do you think they're
going to ignore
the impact of their decisions on the
whole country I don't think so
and I think that you know as as I said
yesterday if the Supreme Court had said
that this abortion pill would not be
available you could just cancel the
elections
just cancel the elections just give it
to the Democrats because I think that
this would be like the the abortion Roe
versus Wade decision this one would
would just make the women say all right
we're done we're done with the
Republicans this just is too far
so
it almost feels as if the Supreme Court
was acting
maybe in the best interest of the
Integrity of the country
now I don't know that
and I don't know if anybody would ever
say that out loud you know nobody would
write it down but it feels like you know
if you had that job I put myself in that
situation all right put myself in that
situation
there's this argument and it's a
technical one about whether the FDA has
you know some responsibility over the
pills or something so it's sort of a
technical thing and the fact the reason
it got to the Supreme Court is it could
go either way
right it doesn't get to the Supreme
Court unless legitimately you can
imagine well that could go either way
like there's an argument either way
otherwise they don't even pick it up
so if there's an argument either way
and you think that one ruling would rip
the country apart and just change the
nature of civilization and the other way
would just be business as usual
because remember it was legal before and
that wasn't ripping the country apart
so they're like one thing will rip the
country apart
one will just be business as usual
and people were already sort of used to
having this pill available like Society
had adjusted to it
I don't know I yeah systems versus goals
that's that's exactly it it could be
that the the Supreme Court valued the
Integrity of the system
over the decision
now I don't think anybody would ever say
that out loud
even if in their minds they were
thinking that and maybe they didn't
think it consciously it could also be a
subconscious
instinct to protect the system
because that would be a good Instinct
you should all have that instinct
um
so I'm going to give a tentative thumbs
up
to the decision
and not because it has anything to do
with the pill
right that's a separate separate
conversation whether that should be
available
but did the Supreme Court
make what I call the the football
decision did they make a hard decision
because that was their job
and there was no there's no yard you
know there's no
guide to tell you how to handle that
specific situation in this specific case
it feels like
it feels like they decided to
keep the public calm that's what it
feels like
what do you think do you think that was
a legitimate just by the book decision
or do you think they were looking at the
bigger picture of civilization
and you know the Integrity of the system
and I don't have any problem if they if
they consider the Integrity of the
system
because the reason we have humans as
judges the reason we have humans as DA's
and humans as uh jury trials
is because you want the people to be
able to make the exceptions when it
makes sense
if they made an exception and just sort
of if this is speculative if they
decided to ignore for a while you know
the Constitutional
specifics and just say well I think we
just have to go this way it just makes
more sense
I'll be okay with that
that's why we have humans all right
here's one that's going to break your
brain so I asked this question because
um I'll tell you why in a minute
um
what let's see your opinion before I
give you the answer
uh in your opinion
what percentage of trans people end up
regretting their transition
look at the numbers I'll just read off
some of the numbers now remember none of
us none of us are in the know right
we're just sort of ignorantly looking
into unless you are actually trans if if
you're not trans
you don't know a lot about this category
right so I'm saying numbers from 90 to
25 percent
you want to know the real number
way under one percent
like way under one percent
yeah what percentage of people regret uh
just a regular surgery
just a normal surgery or percent of
regret
maybe five percent
depends on the surgery right
don't you think a lot of people say I
wish I hadn't gotten that surgery
there are a lot of surgeries where you
can't be sure it's going to work so a
lot of people just end up regretting it
but the according to now let them I know
I know I know I know what you're
thinking you're thinking my way less
than one percent number is complete
 right is that what you think it
say it say it you think that number is
complete now all I know is the
source
right all I know is the source the
source is Google
Google's where Google summarizes you
know the most asked questions when you
search
that's one of the most asked questions
and their answer authoritatively with no
no waffling is that there was I don't
know some study and it came up with way
less than one percent
now I'm going to fool you by agreeing
with that number
I bet you didn't see that coming did you
I agree with that number do you know why
everything I know about everything
suggested should be about that should be
under one percent ask me why
do you know why
because it's not like other surgeries
when you're getting a knee surgery it's
just you're just looking at costs and
benefits and you're taking the gas and
if it doesn't go well you're going to
complain forever right
but if you make a decision so
fundamental to yourself like your
identity it's not your knee
is you it's like your very existence on
this planet is being redefined it's not
a bad knee
if you re if you define your entire
existence
so much so that you know you've done
some medical procedure to achieve it
the odds are
that your brain will tell you you made
the right decision
why because that's how brains work
that's how brains work if you do
something that radical
you do not imagine you did made a
mistake later even if you did
and I'm not saying they did I don't know
one way or the other I'm just saying
that I would expect
a very very low rate of regret
and I would expect that because the
decision is so big that's what causes
cognitive dissonance a small trivial
decision that you get wrong you'll
easily say oh I that up right if
you take a wrong route to a destination
and it makes you late
you usually blame yourself
because it's like a trivial decision I'm
an idiot why'd I do that but if you make
a big decision
like a really big decision
you'll end up telling yourself it was
the right decision no no matter what now
here's the real question are some of you
saying yes but you're wrong
like really it was a bad decision but in
your mind you think is right so you're
wrong about that
no you're not
if you think you're happy you're happy
end of story
right it's not up to me to tell you
you're not happy if you think you're
happy if you think you made the right
choice that's not has nothing to do with
me I'm out I have nothing to do with
that if you think it's the right choice
that's the right choice
that made you happy
now I'd like to add one other thing to
uh
to support the trans Community because
I'm a big supporter
it goes like this
I think we all necessarily look at the
trans situation
through our own filter of our own
experience
if you have never experienced whatever
this gender dysmorphia thing is I've
never experienced it I've never had a
whiff of it I have no idea what that's
about
if you've never experienced it you have
no idea
and I'm not sure you should ever have an
opinion on it that was somebody else's
transition now we're talking adults
remember just adults kids are a
different topic
but for adults do you really think you
can understand how it feels
these are people who are
physically altering
themselves you know permanently I guess
or semi-permanently depending on what
they're doing and
that's a big big decision
you don't think that there's something
going on in their head that is so brutal
that such a I'd call it a fairly radical
decision
makes sense
like you cannot understand how they feel
you cannot and if you don't understand
how they feel
then you can't be a participant even to
judge if they made the right decision
let me give you an example have you ever
done something in your life that you
knew was the wrong decision
and you're going to do it anyway because
it's just how you felt
yeah sometimes you just feel
so strongly about something
that I don't want to hear anybody's
argument I don't care how good it is
don't tell me how good your argument is
sometimes you just need to punch
somebody yeah I know I'm going to go to
jail I'm going to do it anyway so so the
the feelings that people have are part
of the decision
if you don't know how people feel
and that's the biggest part of the
decision then don't second guess whether
they'd be happy about it
because that would be kind of crazy
so so that's my uh why did you hear this
so I heard this yesterday on CNN Jake
Tapper was interviewing
uh I think a man Montana legislation or
a legislator from Montana where there
was some anti-trans law going on and the
trans uh
the trans government person I forget
what job she has
explained that their regret level was
less than one percent and then did what
I did which was I borrowed this compared
it to surgeries in general
people have like back surgery was a good
example people who have back surgery
sometimes
afterwards they go well that was a bad
idea just made it worse
and probably more often than trans
if you believe this surgery now
now that now that I've gone hard in One
Direction
let me give a little bit of support to
some of you who are thinking this right
now
doesn't it seem like there's a lot more
transitioning recently
wouldn't you assume
that any major increase in the number of
people are transitioning would
necessarily
pick up people who are a little closer
to being on the fence
presumably I mean just the math would
suggest that you're picking up more
people who would not have maybe wouldn't
have made the change now I can't say for
sure
that that's bad or good
in other words maybe those extra people
are also happy in the end they might say
Well I'm glad I did this I don't know I
mean I was surprised at the under one
percent if you were surprised that the
under one percent
then you should at least here's all I'll
ask you I'll just ask you this
just acknowledge that if you didn't know
that the official number whether it's
true or not whether it's true or not
we'll talk about but if you didn't know
that the official number is way less
than one percent regret
does it feel weird that you were
you had a strong opinion
now again not about kids kids are a
different topic but for adults
a lot of people say no all right so
let's talk the counter argument the
counter argument goes like this
um we believe that your real problem is
psychological or mental and so we should
work as hard as we can to fix that part
and if we can if that's fixable and I
hate to use fixable because that's
insulting to trans if you say that the
trans can be fixed
I legitimately feel that's an insult
that's like saying gay people can be
fixed that genuinely feels like just an
insult to me
so be careful about how you were these
things because there's sort of some
traps here
but
I would agree with you
that there has to be at this point some
percent I don't know how big or small it
is probably small
of people who are just being caught up
in the persuasion of it and that those
people are far more likely to regret it
than the people who have genuinely
something deep inside their minds that
needs to be addressed you know in terms
of their dysmorphia or whatever
so
I would guess that the way under one
percent number will increase would you
agree with that
that the trend just just because it's
more accepted you're going to get more
people who are not as committed to the
change but still do it they're just not
as committed to it the in theory the
ones were not as committed
are gonna maybe have more regret but
what if it doubles
if it doubles it only goes to two
percent I actually weigh less than two
percent it'd be like one point
three or something you know that if it
doubled
so there's plenty of room for it to get
worse before it would change the fact
that it needs to be an option for some
people
yeah and then uh
then the more basic question is the is
the less than one percent
accurate and then somebody asked this
terrible question that this is a
horrible question right I hate myself
for asking the question but it feels
relevant
did they count the people who killed
themselves
because they would maybe
be in the category of people who
regretted it but I would say I would
think more likely more likely if they
took their lives is because there was
something
you know something in general that was
bothering them even before they
transitioned
so probably the the self-harm
is related to you know the person
overall and maybe not just the the
gender part
no way to know
but uh but I'll give you this I don't
believe the under one percent number is
accurate
do you feel more comfortable with that I
don't believe that number is accurate I
think it's more
uh because data is really hard to get
you know almost every every study we
look at is sketchy fifty percent of all
studies end up not being reproducible
so I wouldn't be surprised if it's
higher but your your estimates of 25 and
40 those seem crazy to me if it were 25
it's all you'd hear about
right I mean I do see you know some
reporters have found like a few dozen
people
who are trying to detransition
but NFL mening right
if 25 of trans regretted it
it's all you'd see it would just be all
over the news that's a lot a lot of
people would be self-harming
and I don't see it
so there's something tells me it's under
10 percent
I can easily believe it's under five
and if it's under five that looks to me
like personal choice
I did a surgery for my voice I told you
this story so when I had the option of
fixing my voice I couldn't speak for
three and a half years at least
intelligibly and I had to have a surgery
it was a new
new surgery
now I got these odds there was 75 chance
I'd be happy I got the surgery and a 25
chance maybe lower
uh that it would make it worse and it
would make it impossible to fix in the
future if ever there was a way to fix it
in the future
that was a big risk
if my voice had not returned
I would have a lot of regret about that
surgery a lot of regret right
and likewise there are people who got
the vaccination and they have regrets
right it's very common to get a medical
procedure and have a regret
so I'm a little amazed that trans would
would be so much less than people's
regret for just almost any other medical
procedure
so
all right
so I just thought I'd give the trans
Community a little support there by
making sure you heard their best
arguments
um
is that useful
is that useful to you because I feel
like I was not hearing the best argument
from the trans Community because I
didn't know about that one percent thing
and again you can doubt it but it's
certainly in the in the area of personal
choice it doesn't look like it's so big
that the law should be against it or
something
all right
um who did the study yeah we could we
can question the study
that would be fair we question all data
all right I just thought I'd add that
little bit of positivity of the world
um
I know sometimes it's hard to tell if
I'm trying to help
I actually am trying to help the BLM
people I actually I'm trying to help
Black America if it doesn't look like it
well
I got your attention it was supposed to
look like I was getting your attention
so if you give me that
that I got your attention
that's what I was trying to do
um
yeah
all right
uh increased transitioning is part of a
psyop you say
yeah I don't know about that I'll tell
you what I never believe
I don't believe anybody who says they
in politics
as soon as you're that that word they
just take yourself out of the
conversation it goes like this they want
us to do this or they want us to eat
bugs
they want us to
uh not have privacy
there is no they
there is no they
there are lots of individuals with
different
agendas but there's no they
the elitist there's no there's no the
elitists
there's no uh there's no Illuminati
there's no Elites Elites exist but they
don't exist with one one opinion you
think the elites have one opinion
I've met the elites they don't have the
same opinions
there's nobody getting in a room and
making these like decisions behind
closed doors it's not happening
yeah Bilderberg
I've told you this before but it's worth
repeating that the world economic Forum
if you see it as this Global Elites who
are forming sort of a second government
that's how people see it
I saw an article that took the opposite
approach
that literally none of the elites take
it seriously but they have to go bow to
it because it looks good
they get a nice vacation in a nice place
it's basically just to look at it's just
a performance and the and the people who
attend are not terribly serious about
any of it
and I think that that that makes far
more sense
in my Dilbert filter of the world that
people are just trying to look good
they're not they're not really in the
corporate world
signaling and looking good is the whole
game that's the whole game you don't get
promoted because you did good work you
know that right
nobody ever got promoted for doing good
work that's not even the thing no you
got promoted because your boss thought
you did good work or your boss was
related or your boss was sleeping with
you or your boss wanted to sleep with
you or or they thought you would do good
work in the future no you don't get
promoted for doing good work
however doing good work is your very
best strategy
it's still your best strategy to do good
work but it's not why you get promoted
there's lots of reasons right
it does help though
uh why are there so many high-ranking
government officials and members of the
WF I just told you
people are joining
to
um signal that there are good people who
believe in the environment and equality
and that that became the the badge that
you wear you know why do people wear
little pins on their lapel
that support a cause
it's because it's the least they can do
it's the least they could do hey if you
put on this little pin that says black
lives matter
would you do that
and then the elite says yeah it's the
least I could do literally it's the
least you could do
how about uh we'll take an all-expense
paid trip to Davos an awesome place
you'll have five-star luxury you'll be
you'll get to meet all these other
famous people
how about that
that's the least I can do yes it's
literally the least you could do attend
a meeting to so that you look good in a
luxury resort that is the least you
could do for black people there's
nothing less you could do
I can't think of anything less important
than that
right so if you think the wef is a big
important uh entity
who told you that
you know who told you that
the guy who puts the wef together and
then you saw the video of him saying
he's got all kinds of Power
because that's his marketing
he's marketing
I'm pretty sure all of those young
economic Forum leaders they were all
going to have the same opinion whether
they flew to Davos or not
going to a luxury vacation in Davos
doesn't change your opinion of anything
it just exposes you to more rich people
that's all it does and Klaus gets to
feel important and he beats a bunch of
rich people and you know he's 80
something years old and
the last thing I'd worry about is the
world economic forum
I I really think that's just for show
but
we'll see
all right anything else in the store in
the news that I'm missing
I think we've done it all
all right
um
that's all for now let me ask you one
question before I sign off on YouTube
what do you think of the phrase uh black
words thinking
insulting or gets to the point
trouble
what do you think racial is racial of
course
I mean the topic is racial
uh
no love it LOL
looking blackwards yes
yeah well as long as white people engage
in it as well okay that's a good comment
so I wouldn't say that it's black words
thinking is something that only black
people do that would be racist yeah that
would be racist so I'll try to avoid
that the the it's about mindset and that
would be common to just humans so yes I
would say black words thinking could be
a white person
who's analyzing
you know the black situation say the
same thing
yeah I would say the crtdi ESG a lot of
them have the same component of black
words thinking
but it's not limited to black people
that seemed quantacity
yeah that's right there's a word
audacity a cogate Caucasian audacity is
audacity
so I guess there's I guess there's a
little uh precedent for this kind of
word play
the woke won't like black words what's
the point
see if you could get the woke to argue
the word
you win
that would be winning get people to
argue that the word is the wrong word
that would be willing
yeah I wouldn't by the way I wouldn't
use this at work you would totally get
fired
oh just to be clear it's something that
I can say that you can't say because I I
have something closer to free speech
has anybody Marvel that the fact that I
have free speech now and I'm using it if
you haven't seen the Dilbert comic
lately Dilbert reborn it's only on the
subscription site now you wouldn't fully
appreciate it
but
I tell you yeah you're jealous it's fun
it really is an amazing feeling I didn't
think I'd ever feel it that I could
actually just say what I think is true
are you to say it
other people can't do it yeah I paid for
it it was very expensive but I think I
got my money's worth
uh thoughts on good credit punishment we
talked about that
what somebody wait a minute somebody did
you just make that
because I'm seeing a meme that says
black words does that already exist or
did you just make that up on the Fly
you have to tell me
that's a book title
oh it's a book title apparently it's a
book title well now you have to tell me
is a is it is the author black
because if the author is black I'm in
good shape
is the author black
uh he was assassinated to what
it would not have been published
otherwise well yeah
by Ron Christie
no that doesn't sound as black as it
could sound
yeah you can't tell by the name but
um
huh all right well so I'll have to watch
out for that because if it turns out
that the guy who wrote that book has any
sketchy accusations I better stay away
from it
yeah Ron
have you ever met a black guy named
Ronnie
oh yeah Ronnie Lott Ronnie lot
yeah Ronnie locked so that could be yeah
that could easily be a black man
so
uh Curious to hear Tom Sonos
oh it's on Urban Dictionary already
but and it's used the same way right in
the Urban Dictionary is it defined as
sort of looking backwards and so forward
I assume it is
oh he is black somebody says
he's a black Republican strategist
the Ron Christie is the black oh we have
confirmation so somebody looked it up
Ron Christie is a black man
and he wrote a book
called black words
we'll have to take a look at that
I do think it's it's a strong play
all right
um
all right I guess I guess lots of people
had black friends named Ronnie so
Ronnie's more common than I thought
I just love the fact that I can just
talk about this topic without worry
it's such a freeing thing
like if I could find just a few more
people to talk to you know ideally I'd
love to talk to black guys who are also
completely free and can just use free
speech that would be interesting
all right YouTube bye for now I'll talk
to you tomorrow
