huh well this one's not
working I'm guessing I got to reverse
this
view
nope
seriously this really isn't going to
work is
it this is
remarkable
hey
all right I'm not happy with Twitter so
I'm signing off all right Twitter's
off because the interface is too
stupid
but how's the sound on
YouTube YouTube you got
sound everybody
good two iPads
now if I YouTube you missed all my
bitching this
morning
because
uh of of all the Twitter problems in the
world I couldn't sign on to Twitter this
morning don't know why no idea
but if you'd like your day to go up to
levels that are much better than my day
so far all you need is a cup or mugar
glass a tanker chela a canteen juger
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee join me
now for the unparallel pleasure of the
dopamine to the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go yes we're broadcasting on
locals and on YouTube I've given up on
Rumble until they make some technical
changes and
uh apparently I can't make Twitter work
because the interface is too
stupid but I'll keep working on
that uh how about the news anybody want
to hear about some news all right my
first story is what I call Employee of
the Month employee of the month this is
apparently a real story back in
1945 a gentleman named suomo Yamaguchi
he survived the Atomic blast at
Hiroshima he actually survived the blast
he dragged himself to an open air to to
an air raid
shelter spent the night and then he
caught the morning train so he could
arrive at his job on
time his job was in uh nasaki
nasaki uh where he survived a second
Atomic
blast you just can't kill that
guy
I I don't know if he's still alive I
have a feeling he's
Immortal he might be he he might be the
unluckiest person who ever lived but he
might also be immortal he might still be
around but anyway I call that Employee
of the Month Employee of the
Month um so if there had been maybe
three Atomic blasts he could be employee
of the year but you know we don't want
to you don't want to just give away
these honors got to earn them
well if there's one thing I love Elon
Musk for it's uh inventing ill
Interstellar
travel no that's not what I love him for
he's doing that too I love him for being
the richest man in the world and not
being above making dick
jokes on social media now that's why I
love him if you could be the richest
person in the world and still like
making dick
jokes you know
unabashedly with no apology
whatsoever you can't get any better than
that that's like your ultimate
billionaire but anyway he uh he
posted uh so I guess he doesn't like
Wikipedia I'm figuring this out in
context apparently Wikipedia has some
facts that he doesn't think are accurate
about
himself have I ever mentioned that all
news about public figures is fake
including Wikipedia I don't know if it's
still there but Wikipedia used to have
some awards that I never heard of that
apparently I'm the winner of I won some
awards didn't even know about it so yeah
so Elon Musk talking about
Wikipedia he
said and you never know if this is
serious because it might actually be
serious he said I will give them a
billion dollars if they change their
name to dickipedia
[Laughter]
he's literally the only person in the
world who could say this
sentence I'll give you a billion dollars
if you change your name to dickipedia
and you and you say to yourself would he
really would he would he really would he
actually literally write a check for a
billion
dollars and and here's the funny part I
don't know
I don't
know might it would be the funniest
thing anybody ever did that might be
worth a billion dollars to him if you
had a few extra billions you never know
anyway well I would like to thank Matt
Gates again for doing the best thing
that's ever happened to Congress which
is make them ineffective so that they
can't spend any more of my money on
other
people ever since Matt Gates LED his
Insurrection to get rid of the speaker I
have not spent one extra Penny on people
I didn't want to spend money
on this is the best few weeks of my uh
American life so far thank you Matt
Gates now I know what you're thinking to
me but Scott Scott Scott what about all
the normal business that's been delayed
well that those are big
problems let me read some of the big
problems from the delay of not having
speaker
um okay there are no problems but there
could have
been huh there could have
been so just remember that there could
have been a
problem all right well it seems like
progress so let's keep going uh in my
opinion the biggest existential threat
to the
world is omn nius bills an omnius where
they take all the separate spending
packages and put them into one big
Frankenstein monster so that nobody can
say no because if say they say no their
own little pork won't get approved and
they like their pork more than they like
the country or the world so in my
opinion we have a system the current
system which would guarantee that all
bills become these omnius bills which
further guarantees that the deficit
continues to Sky rocket which further
guarantees the destruction of the
economy which guarantees the destruction
of
America which largely guarantees that
the the whole world will go to
chaos so in my opinion Matt Gates is the
only
Force preventing the worst thing in the
world the the number one danger in the
world he's you know he's got some help
but basically this is one guy trying to
protect you from the the destruction of
the world which is clear and well
defined and the path to our end is is
right in front of us hey hey would you
like to be dead fairly soon well yes I
would how would you do that oh watch
this we're going to do one omnius after
another and then keep your eye on this
number that's called the total debt when
it reaches a little bit further well
then you're all dead everything falls
apart would you like that yes I would
sign me up for that that's what we've
been doing until now sign me up for
definite no doubt about it destruction
of all
civilization sign me up and only one
 person said no to it Matt Gates
now some other people joined him but I
think basically he's the driver here
so do I want a speaker no no I do not
want a speaker under the condition that
there's even a possib possibility that
that speaker would uh push forward an
omnius Bill no omnius bill or no
speaker pick one totally on board with
that well here's a dog that continues to
not
bark I'm trying to imagine a world in
which uh Trump being the number one news
maker of all time and of course the
person who gets all the clicks going on
the left if he does
anything
and he's got all these legal charges
against him and we've been yapping about
him
forever right so it's always it's been
big big news every time there's a new
charge against Trump every time he's in
court big big
news but now that it seems like all of
the charges are sort of out there
there's a little more
transparency and we're seeing for
example uh two of his lawyers take plea
deals and the the left is just
masturbating furiously to that saying oh
plea deals that means they're going to
testify against
Trump doesn't look like
that maybe I mean it's not
impossible but it looks far more like
they were both so
overcharged that it just had to be
unwounded because it would have been by
some higher Court anyway so it looked
like they were just reducing their
embarrassment by taking the charges down
to something that could be pled out and
then it
was so here's my question
why if Trump is the likely nominee
according to the polls and he's the
biggest problem in the world according
to the left and the left controls their
own news
networks why AR they talking about him
maybe going to jail every single day
wouldn't that be the just the biggest
biggest news thing you know shouldn't
they be doing stories about what he
would look like if he if he had to wear
the
jumpsuit right right well what don't you
think that they'd be doing all kinds of
stories about specifically which jail
would he go to right because where do
presidents go to jail don't you think
that should be a
story what what would happen if he's in
jail and wins the election isn't that a
story you don't think people would click
on that of course they would so where's
the story why why is the biggest story
that's not a war you know the wars are
obviously bigger stories at the moment
but even below that there's still other
news but it's not this do you know why I
think here's why I
think I think the news knows that these
charges aren't real and they know that
they're not going to stick and if they
did
stick at the trial level they would get
overturned at the Supreme Court because
these are very
clearly not legit legate um uses of the
Department of Justice these are very
clearly political
prosecutions and you also saw that
Trump's popularity went up instead of
down he's now dominating all polls
against
everybody the less he
says he he's been unusually quiet you
know by Trump standards I tell you the
less he says put that gag order on him
we should there should be a gag order
for everything that you don't want him
talking
about so yes that that dog is really not
barking not making a big deal of that
story anymore all right um there's a
reframe in my book that all of you
should have by now reframe your brain
it's one of my favorite ones and this
will this will just show you how
powerful reframes are uh both your your
personal life your business life and
everything else and the reframe is this
your boss is not in
charge the best idea is always in charge
or the person with the best idea is
always in charge and here's what I mean
by that if your boss had a bad idea and
said well I don't have a better idea but
this is the best idea we have so we're
going to do this then you raised your
hand and said oh I've got a better idea
and then you're explain your better idea
and let's say it's just obvious it's a
better idea what's your boss going to do
is your boss going to say nope nope yeah
it is a better idea but it's not my idea
so we're going to do my idea sometimes
but usually usually if you have a
functional boss they're going to say oh
okay I didn't know about that idea but
that's a good idea we're going to do
that so who is in charge and that's
scenario who was in charge it was the
person with the idea because the idea is
more powerful than the labels you know
the
titles so never think that your boss is
in charge your boss is only in charge if
you don't have a better idea it's sort
of a default but the primary thing
everybody wants including your boss is
for you to have a better idea than the
boss has perfect oh that's a good idea
let's do your idea now this applies to
everything it's not just your job it
would apply to your you know
relationships but also applies to the
world and so here's where I'm heading if
you were a public figure and you talked
about the news and you were talking
about some big story and you happen to
have the best
idea you'd be in charge of the whole
world as long as other people also saw
it as the best idea now you wouldn't
have to implement it but you'd sort of
be in charge it was your idea so if
somebody could come up with a better
idea about what Israel should do with
their tunnels and uh with
Gaza that person actually would be
controlling the
war because at the point wouldn't you
agree that nobody has a good
idea right as I as I pointed out if
Israel did nothing and left Hamas there
that's obviously a mistake if they do
something small let not going to get it
done that's a mistake if they do
something big it's certainly going to
have uh civilian
deaths that seem unreasonable to their
enemies and then it will be used forever
as a weapon against them to organize
other forces that might come at them
harder than anything has ever come at
them so they can't do
nothing they can't do a little and they
can't do a lot every every one of those
paths leads to destruction and on top of
that they've got Biden saying don't go
in there and kill a bunch of uh
civilians so what do they do this is a
100% unsolvable
problem right if somebody came up with a
better
idea they would take it do you know why
because it would be a better idea and
they have no ideas of their own as far
as we know at least not in public so I'm
going to give them a better idea
I'll just take over so I'm going to take
over this whole Israel H you know Hamas
situation here's a better
idea you can't wait forever everybody
agrees on that you can't just sort of
surround him and just wait
forever but here's what you can do and
they might already be doing it you could
do lots of probing to find out you know
at least some of the tunnel openings you
don't have to get them all but you need
to get some some of them because they're
connected so if you get any one of them
in theory you've got a way to get to the
others now of course they'd have doors
so if you tried flooding one they could
presumably close it off if they got
there in time but here's what I'm
suggesting it turns out that all of the
known Solutions like to the public don't
work how many of you say it's obvious
just flood the
tunnels have you looked into
that you you do you know what that would
do so it turns out that a little bit of
sea water added to a little bit of
drinking water ruins a lot of drinking
water right if you put one gallon of
just sea water into your drinking Source
it would pollute basically make it
undrinkable a very large portion of
it the aquafers that are under Gaza are
their water
source if you flood the tunnels you're
also flooding the aquifer
you're removing from them the ability to
drink water
locally did you know
that that's that's not a small problem
that's basically making it unlivable
forever the other problem is that if
they do that in the area that would have
been agriculture because some of it is
agriculture it makes it unusable for
agriculture it can also collapse some
things above that's not clear depends
how deep the tunnels are and did you
know that Egypt has been flooding
Tunnels for a long time that's how Egypt
handles it they actually flood the
tunnels that are on the you know near
Egypt and exactly like I said it ruined
their drinking water and they can't grow
crops in that area that Egypt is
flooding
tunnels but it does work it does work in
a sense I mean it's it's not an ideal
situation and you wouldn't want to do it
maybe in the populated areas and you
know get the whole aquifer all right so
here's my
idea uh follow along and see if these
assumptions follow number one Israel has
known about the danger from the Hamas
Tunnels for decades would you agree so
it's not sneaking up on them all right
number two you would of course you would
agree number two Israel is a highly
Advanced uh
military uh technologically and every
other way and they probably been working
on the question of how you clear
terrorists from a tunnel for probably 20
or 30
years assumption number three because I
think you're you're with me so far
they've known about the tunnels they're
very capable of you know looking at
threats and figuring out their options
assumption number three
whatever options the Israelis have for
clearing tunnels would not be
necessarily known to the public would
you agree with that for example if they
have the most
kickass uh robot that's designed with
you can imagine an autonomous AI robot
with a gigantic uh you know
Shield that just goes down in front and
they shoot at it it just bounces off The
Shield and then it gases everybody or
something puts them to sleep let's say
now I'm not saying they have a tunnel
clearing robot I'm saying they could the
the technology does allow them to have
an
autonomous terrorist killing tunel
robot now it might kill everybody in the
you everybody there orgasm to sleep or
something but there's nothing that would
stop them from having something like
that you just wouldn't know about it
would you you just wouldn't know now
here's what I think I think Israel
should not go in
Fast and they should not wait forever
there there's a sweet spot of when to go
in and part of it is to make sure that
they've controlled
entirely uh the news coming in and out
you want to completely control the news
you want to make sure all their phones
are dead uh on the attack side and you
want to make sure that they're
hungry so you want everybody to be in a
worst situation before you're ready to
go in right but you don't want to go in
hard with a normal ground attack so
here's what I'm going to add it should
only be as many um pin prick attacks as
it takes to identify how to how to solve
the tunnels in other words their only
military action should be against the
tunnels uh with small surgical uh teams
maybe special ops or whatever and
they're just going in and they're they
probably by now completely control the
visuals right so one of the interesting
things about Gaza is they don't have a
lot of
clouds so if you've got a
satellites us plus whatever Israel has
you you have a view from above that can
go down to probably you know certainly
you could spot people they probably also
have
drones that now have you know fixed
cameras or floating cameras all over the
place so so they should be able to use
their their resources to figure out
where the teams should go in to look for
tunnels then you find a bunch of tunnels
and the next thing you do is you test
your best idea if the best idea is some
special gas that they've developed for
it test that maybe it's a special robot
uh my idea of uh tying a rope around
representative Eric swell and just
lowering him him in and just waiting
that's just one idea they might have
better ideas than that like I said
they've been working on it for decades
we just started thinking about it so it
my my take is that Israel is doing
exactly the right thing and they may be
they might actually be pretending that
Biden is preventing them from going in
they might be pretending because it
might be that they the last thing they
want to do is a regular ground
Invasion I think they're going to use
persuasion technology
pinpoint teams and take as long as it
takes right they don't really need to
hurry and if you said to me you know all
right there's one team that's running
out of everything and they're going to
try to protect protect tunnels they're
going to be in these tunnels where we
can find them and then another team has
nearly infinite resources and Technology
smartest people around and the United
States on their side and all the time in
the world to go look for the tunnels and
then destroy
them a time is definitely on Israel's
side so I would say that using an excuse
like oh Biden said don't go in to make
it look like oh we want to go in man do
we want to go in we want to go in so
badly but you know Biden you know how
Biden is he's just he we we want revenge
we want the Israeli people to really
feel like their military has their back
but darn it that Biden's telling us to
wait I think the waiting is always part
of the plan I think that Israel would
like to be a lot more
prepared specifically for the tunnels
and everything else as well so we have
heard that they might be making some um
probes Israel might be probing to see
where the defenses are and to get them
to react but if Israel keeps
probing and then they keep watching the
reaction they should be able to map out
pretty much where everybody is and who's
bad and who's good and which buildings
to make disappear so I think that
they'll be finding buildings to
disappear and checking and trying out
Innovative so here here's my best
prediction when it's done you're going
to find that they tried something in the
tunnels that was not flooding them they
might flood some but I don't think
flooding will be the primary answer but
be something that you said to yourself
oh I didn't know they could do
that what do you think do you think
you'll be surprised when you find out
well actually we might never even hear
it's possible we'll never hear how they
clear the tunnels because they might
want to keep that to themselves you
wouldn't want to tell them and then they
can build tunnels that would thwart
whatever the new technology is so you
want to keep that secret till you need
it so that's my take um if Israel had
not thought of the idea of postponing
the ground
assault until they had a full ab test of
all the tunnel
techniques now they got
it now in my opinion that's the best
idea would you agree if you heard those
options who would you side with option
number one surround it and just leave
them in there option number two classic
ground assault started pretty soon lots
of casualties or Scots idea which is
probably already their idea so I'm
acting like they hadn't thought of it
but in in my world they've already
thought of this so they're probably
doing it anyway in my world they would
be probing the tunnels and looking for a
better technique as long as it takes to
get it done with the minimum amount of
casualties all
right uh how many of you saw the new
Trump ad campaign ad about
brainwashing and about Hillary Clinton
wants to
deprogram uh the Maga people and called
you a basket of
deplorables uh and then brainwashed is
actually the the word that uh Trump is
using well um here's what I
think I think this might be the
beginning of something really
important because we've been in this
artificial argument about politics where
we think it's oh the Democrats their
policies and their and their candidates
oh and they're and they're saying oh
those Republicans are bad but do you
ever wonder if we're just in a play it's
like an
illusion and what we think is the world
is just nothing like the actual World
sort of Matrix
like well here's what's going to happen
you're about to find
out now some of you already know what's
going on but the rest of the world might
find out here's what Trump can do and he
might be on the way to doing it that
would be the most
mindboggling thing of all time instead
of arguing about what is true or false
or what policy works or doesn't which is
almost a waste of time because whatever
is going on is very tribal and has to do
with propaganda and brainwashing if he
could change the
conversation to who's more
brainwashed he
wins he's changing the playing field if
he stays in his normal playing field
where it's policy policy policy you're a
racist no you're a racist all this
traditional stuff he's
vulnerable but if he takes the argument
to you know in a literal sense Democrats
are being brainwashed
could he make that
case with a little
help well let's walk through a few
things and uh and I'll I'll let you
know um so suppose he he created this
Frame where we think we have this thing
called a republic or democratic system
but it's never been like that and it's
always been a trick and everything's
rigged could he sell it do you think you
could sell
that yeah he
could yeah he could you could let me uh
go through a few things and we'll put
this argument together but uh as I
posted this morning I think the path is
about to get
illuminated there there is a dark path
you don't know where it is but it's
about to get
illuminated and I'm going to start to
turn on the lights right now
I saw a post from Dennis Peterson a user
on the xplatform and he posted this
morning uh I had a college class I had a
college class that provided Telltale
sence of brainwashing in
commercials it recommended developing
tools to detect it they were called uh
quote crap detectors I still use it
today now um I'm guessing that the
person who posted this dentist is a
certain age you probably probably not
20 cuz I don't believe colleges teach
this anymore what do you think do you
think a a current College course would
involve spotting
brainwashing I don't think
so I'll bet
not so what if you knew that suppose
you're a 20-year-old and I say to you
did you know this colleges used to teach
you how to spot
brainwashing but they don't do it
anymore did you know it was a
skill did you know that your common
sense won't help you a bit did you know
that if you were brainwashed you
wouldn't know
it it would help if you taken this
course but it's not it's not taught
anymore evidence number one I will build
my case slowly in front of you
uh there's an article today getting a
lot of attention from Constantine uh
kissm you know him from the uh
triggernometry podcast so he writes in
the Free Press title of it is the day
the delusions
died and here's his uh intro to the
article he says a lot of people woke up
on October 7th as progressives and went
to bed that night feeling like
conservatives what changed now of course
that was when isra was attacked by
Hamas
um and yeah his part is that the
wokeness was always about power and that
we've been asleep at the
switch now when people read this article
do they say oh that's a weird you know
strange thing you're saying that I don't
understand at all and doesn't seem to
apply or do they say well yes that's a
pretty good description of what happened
this this is another
indication when he says that people went
to bed or woke up as progressives and
went to bed as conservatives that their
Progressive ideology was not based on
reality it was based on a version of
reality that that's essentially what is
being said because the point is not that
this one event horrible as it was
October 7th is not that that event
changed
everything it changed how you see see
everything that's a big difference it
didn't change everything it changed how
you see
everything and you can see all the
forces are starting to
align to reframe the
situation as a gigantic
scop not just Israel but just our whole
situation um here are some things I
would recommend to somebody who was is
wondering if they are in some kind of
a u some kind of a
bubble um going to give you a bunch of
things that if you were to consume them
it would change forever how you thought
of your
reality but first I recommend this
reframe for Trump for Trump's campaign
now this would also work for V
ramaswami maybe it just works for
Republicans but it would work for Trump
really well and this would be the slogan
I'm
suggesting um I'm running to save
Democrats from other
Democrats I'm looking to save
Democrats from other
Democrats he wouldn't even need to
explain it
right he would not need to explain what
that means everybody gets it now so
there are enough Democrats who
understand that for example the uh the
teachers union Democrats are one of the
maybe the biggest problem in the country
right now that's not
that that the kids are being brainwashed
in a very bad
way um they would also look at the
Israel situation and they would watch
their fellow Democrats who
seemingly aren as uh let's say on their
team as they thought they
were so I think that frame is very
important he's not trying to if you
think if you think Trump is on the
Republican team and he's against your
team you have a team
reflex if he says dudes I'm trying to
save you from your own team do you see
this do you see what they're doing
because at this point they do they do
see it so you could probably carve off a
few people just with that framing here
are some of the things I would suggest
to somebody to to wake them up to
reality you should watch the uh Oliver
Stone uh he's uh came out with a new I
guess you call it a documentary about
JFK's um murder assassination now he did
a movie about it a long time ago but
he's updating it because there's new new
materials involved but among the other
things that he would
learn and I only learned this when I was
just started to watch it
did you know who was the head of the
Warren Commission that was the
government's uh effort to totally
research what happened in the Kennedy
assassination with the most you know the
most Dependable people like really
credible people and then put together
the the
Warren uh commission report well it
turns out that the
chairperson was the only the only one
who didn't have another day job so you
know he was available basically so the
person who was the chair person did most
of the work he he did like 30% of all
the talking and question answering and
stuff like that definitely the most
influential person was the chairman who
is that chairman um Alan Dulles does
that name sound familiar Alan
Dulles he had been the head of the CIA
before that and he' been
fired do you know who fired
him
JFK do you know why he fired ired him
for trying to run an Empire on his own
that was independent from the
government Dulles was out there trying
to overthrow countries assassinate
people without the approval or even the
knowledge of the president of the United
States do you think that's weird and
unusual and uh historically like
crazy well here's something else to blow
your mind the the FBI was the same
situation under J Hoover Hoover
basically ran his own Empire and he did
not answer the president
exactly so JFK had an FBI that was
absolutely his enemy instead of his
employee and a CIA that was absolutely
his enemy not his
employees and one day he fired the head
of the
CIA do you know who the number one
suspect is for uh somebody who who might
have killed Kennedy or ordered it to be
done in a conspiracy theory sense who
would be the number one suspect the
number one suspect in the murder is the
person the government put in charge of
determining who did
it if you didn't know that and by the
way I didn't know it until this
week you would you don't understand
anything and sure enough Dallas came up
with a report that many people
questioned in lots of different ways
that Oliver Stone uh points out in the
movie uh there's lots of reason to
believe it wasn't that one shooter the
best reason is that we have a video of
the bullet coming from the other
direction you could actually see it with
your own eyes your own eyes you could
see the bullet hit him in the front and
put his head
back and we were gas lated as a nation
to believe it was the odd effect of a
bullet coming in the front and blowing
out the the front of the head and
causing his head to go back because he
got hit in the front or you know what I
mean you got in other words we were told
that his head would move in the opposite
direction of the
bullet well I'm no expert on people
getting shot in the head but I feel like
you always move in the direction of the
bullet I don't think it moves the other
way and and we were Gasol to think that
that most basic obvious incorrect thing
was the like key point and that there
was one magic bullet that hit the
governor and the president at the same
time ridiculous things you know you know
what would be as ridiculous as the story
we were told about Kennedy's
assassination I'll just give you an
example something as
ridiculous would be believing that some
other president said that neo-nazis were
marching were fine
people that would be hard to to believe
wouldn't
it but people did they believe that
actually happened in the real world half
of the country believes that President
Trump suggested drinking
bleach do you think you couldn't sell
somebody that a bullet makes you your
head move in the direction of the bullet
or that the bullet came you can
apparently convince the public of
absolutely
anything absolutely anything and it
started a long time ago yes so I would
say the all the evidence suggests that
the CIA working with the mafia oh did
you not know that yeah the CIA and the
mafia were almost the same
group yeah they worked together for
Mutual benefit for many years yeah
didn't know that did you well probably a
lot of you did know that um here's
something else I would tell somebody so
so these are things I would present to
somebody if I were trying to wake them
up and un-brainwash them I wouldn't
start with the specific things they
don't believe so I wouldn't start with
the hoax I would start with the
background to show that citizens of the
US have
always been brainwashed a lot so this uh
so this documentary on JFK would be a
good start secondly I was looking for uh
I was looking for uh an interview cuz I
saw it the other day Tim pool was
talking to Dr Robert Epstein about um Dr
Epstein's idea that Google specifically
uh is in charge of who gets elected and
therefore Trump doesn't have any chance
and that the polls have nothing to do
with anything and that uh Google can uh
can brainwash you without you knowing it
they do it using something called
ephemeral uh ads EP teral means
something that doesn't stick around or
get recorded right so most of what you
do on social media gets somehow recorded
in some database if you're looking to
buy a certain product somewhere that
gets recorded because that's how you get
pitched that same product on your other
device on another app right but there
are things that happen as you're using
social media that don't get recorded
they're just things that happen for
example if you do a search for as I did
um Dr Robert
Epstein you would see maybe a search
result that was the one you wanted to
click on but you might not notice that
there were things all over the page that
were other advertisements and search
results but those would be influencing
you too if only by volume because the
more you see something the more you
think it's true so if if all around it
it said some version of the truth that
they wanted you to believe you wouldn't
even spend too much time reading it but
you'd notice oh dogs can fly everywhere
on this page it says dogs can fly well I
don't believe dogs can fly but if every
time you did a Google search there was
another article about flying dogs
eventually you would say to yourself I
don't know may maybe maybe maybe there's
a flying dog right so it's actually is
that powerful and uh Dr Epstein has
found some tools and Technology he
claims now I would I would add some
skepticism because I haven't checked his
work and it's a pretty big claim he's
making his claim is that he can capture
the ephemeral ads the things that don't
get recorded and he can tell you how
they've affected you in his
opinion um it moves the vote from 6 to
25 million votes just Google and just
using this trick just that trick 6 to 25
million and to put that in context uh I
think Trump won five of 13 Battleground
States in this last election he
lost but if Google had not been
influencing people according to Dr
Epstein and and intentionally if they
had not been intentionally brainwashing
you with search results uh Trump would
have won 11 out of 13 of
the uh the Battleground
areas is that true well it's a big clay
so you should maintain a little
skepticism about it but the context I'm
giving you this is that you should um
it's how you would deprogram somebody
you would say are you aware of this are
you aware of that are you aware of that
if you can get them to be aware of the
historical stuff it's going to be way
easier to convince them that it's never
changed it's hard to say you're
hypnotized it's much easier to say
here's history and this is a history
people AR are arguing about left and
right Democrats and Republicans this
history they agree with right nobody's
nobody saying that Ellen dullis wasn't
the head of the Warren
Commission right because so the history
were pretty agreed on
um
so uh the other thing Dr Epstein said
that was uh just shocking is they looked
at uh Republicans and Democrats uh and
their different
their different experience of using
Google so apparently I think this was
the most recent presidential election if
you were a
Democrat 100% of the time because they
can kind of tell who you are you know
they know who you are they can tell if
you're a Democrat so if you're a
Democrat 100% of the time if you used
Google right before the election it
would remind you to vote 100% of the
time a little extra hey remember to vote
if you're a republican say same time 59%
of them saw
it
59% is that an accident of course not of
course it's not an accident oh and do
you think that that would influence
turnout at a national level of course
absolutely don't know how much so these
are the things that are happening right
now and by the way Dr Epstein knows
because we've seen a I guess he saw some
message between Google and Wall Street
Journal in which they talked about using
ephemeral ads to influence people uh in
a way that they wanted to influence them
so it's a known thing with a name that
Google refers
to when they're talking to the Wall
Street Journal they actually asked you
know what kind of ephemeral Adge should
they use to influence this particular
topic that's a real
thing so I saw the ad I saw Epstein's on
Tim pool show I'm not sure the date of
it but I went to uh look for it so I
went to Google and I put in uh
timpool and Epstein and
Google that should find it right it's
Tim poool show one of his major
guests talking about Google well there
were lots of lots of stories about uh
Epstein's
Island I couldn't find
it I couldn't Google it
that's
right the Tim
pool the Tim pool uh interview with the
guy who says Google is brainwashing
everybody and controlling the country I
went to Google
it couldn't find
it I only refound it by looking at my
own tweet because I'd seen it in some
natural way before that just hold that
in your
head I couldn't google it now now uh and
and it's also true that if you use Bing
or other things you'll get different
results so it is definitely Google doing
it it's definitely intentional and
there's definitely an agenda no doubt
about
it all right now now that you've heard
this about Google and that they could
actually uh guaranteed change the
control of the election guaranteed if
Epstein's
right um
what do you think about Tik Tock
now do you think Tik Tock is hypnotizing
your
children
yes yes really really obviously so do
you remember when uh it looked like you
know maybe maybe we'd get on top of it
and people like me were saying you know
cancel Tik Tok and there were uh
politicians were saying it too you know
Tom Cotton other people were saying yeah
ban ban Tik Tok and it looked like it
might
happen and then Tik Tok started running
commercials on Fox
news they
won they won they hypnotized the world
sufficiently and probably there was
money involved and Etc but they actually
hypnotized the world into thinking that
they were acceptable when they're one of
the biggest risks to the
country all it took was money and
persuasion and they had
both um next I would show somebody I was
trying to convince that they had been
brainwashed and from The hoax list they
would of course as you know they'd say
no no no these are all real things and
then I would refer them back to um let's
say project
Mockingbird you all know project
Mockingbird so that was when the CIA was
using the media quite intentionally it's
all public it's about history to uh
brainwash the citizens of the United
States then I would talk about Obama
signing the uh the
amendment that would allow the CIA to
brainwash people in the United States
again but only with this little
technical thing they have to do first
they have to create the materials to
brainwash other countries like as to
look like that's the purpose of it but
then they could repurpose it in the
United States that's a known thing
that's all
legal um I would uh oh so I talked about
the uh L D thing and how they put the
most likely guilty person in charge of
finding the real killer sort of like
having a OJ looking for the real color
exactly like that and then I saw a tweet
that tweeted at me from un Hoodwinked
saying this Ellen Dulles former head of
CIA CIA was also the head of the Warren
Commission the CIA put the wolf in
charge of the hen house the outcome
could only go one way now that's what I
told you and then he points this out the
the bioweapon facilitating CIA used the
same Playbook with fouchy and the co
origin they put fouchy in charge of
determining if the virus came from the
lab that fouchy was accused of
funding that does look a little familiar
doesn't
it all right I don't know what's true
there but that's a pattern I wouldn't
ignore
um how many of you know the gulf of
tonan event the godess that triggered uh
the Vietnam War and you know it was made
up right the United States acted like
two of its ships had been fired or no
one of its ships had been fired on twice
wasn't true it was a cause of
War now if you were a citizen and you
didn't know that had ever happened
wouldn't you be shocked
imagine not knowing that that was a real
thing that
happened um and of course on the hoax
list would be the 51 Intel people that
signed that Hunter laptop letter saying
that it was a misinformation from
disinformation from
Russia I would point that one out I
would point out the Russia collusion
hoax and I was also talk about newsguard
do you know newsguard it's an EU
organization to um make sure that online
speech is policed but of course it's
their version of what's okay so it's
just a censorship vehicle so you would
also have to teach uh people the the
Democrat censorship machine in which
they use everything from Nos and think
tanks and uh fake fact Checkers and fake
Watchdogs like the ADL that are
partially legitimate so the ADL does a
bunch of good work you know making sure
there's less discrimination against
Jewish people and other people but when
needed they're just political so they're
just Democrat hit HIIT uh basically
attack dogs so all of these fact
Checkers Watch Dogs uh think tanks these
are all fake and they're designed so
that the news people can refer to
somebody else so it doesn't look like
the news is lying directly well the fact
Checkers well the think tag says well
you know so if you don't understand that
there's a uh a structure in which the
Democrats have put people who have
cycled through the government as
Democrats they make sure that they're
really tight with the Democrat
leadership and then they're the perfect
person to lead let's say the ADL or to
lead this factchecking place or to be on
News Guard so if you don't understand
that there's a structure uh and design
to suppress Free Speech especially from
one side then you don't know what's
happening I mean you'd be really
confused if you didn't know that that
was the design of our current
system all right
um now let's look at Mitch McConnell
they trotted him out to talk about
funding uh the war in Ukraine and he
said I'll paraphrase he said that uh
we're degrading the the military of our
biggest military opponent
Russia and we're using uh a great deal
of the money that we say is for Ukraine
will actually be
um will actually be spent on states in
the United States and that we're
basically buying
uh all right is this this is just trolls
over on the yelling that the sound is
bad
right will somebody confirm the Sound
Works on
YouTube Sound is great right so those
are just trolls because they know that
that that it bothers me when they do
that right so just ignore them because
now that we know that it's just trolls
the sound is fine all right so imagine
imagine being one of those
trolls imagine being that you woke up
this morning and and the most important
thing in your life was to up
something that other people were
enjoying and that that was all you were
that was like a purpose and it's not
just one person apparently there's a
whole bunch of people there who have
decided to be really
fun I think I'll make the world the
world a worse
place yeah thank you you you don't have
to talk about this sound anymore we're
all clear on that all right so McConnell
says uh that it's good to fund Ukraine
because not only is it degrading
Russia's military
capability uh but a lot of that money is
going to uh businesses that make
military stuff in the United States so
it's basically almost giving the money
to ourselves in a
way does that sound like a solid plan or
a bunch of
brainwashing to stuff the pockets of the
military-industrial
complex cuz to me he's saying directly
that this is not
legitimate did did any of you vote to
start a war with
Russia a war
of what would I call it opportunity it's
a war of
opportunity so basically McConnell is
saying you
know we um uh these are my words but
it's as if he's saying you know we got
lucky cuz when Russia started this war
we realized we could we could jump in
and then we could really degrade them in
other words we declared war on
Russia but we're doing it in a tricky
way that also makes our friends Rich who
make
weapons I think he's telling us that
directly
now and we're so hypnotized that we're
like well all right I guess that was a
good idea pretty clever of you to
degrade Russia and also you know beef up
our internal economy
oh my
God oh my God the fact that they say it
directly now is the part that's blowing
my mind there's nothing you can't tell
the public at this point you could you
could make the public or at least half
of it believe anything just anything
that's where we're that's where we're
at all right well Free Speech
supporters uh here's some good good news
bad news I think it's going to end more
good news but um there was a lower court
that temporarily blocked the federal
government from working with private
companies like social media to censor
speech now you probably said to yourself
well that's a victory so lower a lower
court just said your government cannot
restrict your free speech by working
with the platforms yay here's the bad
news the Supreme Court just uh uh wiped
that away so it is now back to
temporarily Supreme Court temporarily
they are going they're going to they're
going to take the case so the good news
is the Supreme Court is going to take
the case but
temporarily they didn't think that the
temporary uh restrictions were
appropriate so I I don't have a good
reasoning for
that uh I don't hate it if if it's
temporary as long as they get serious
about it so I'm generally okay with any
part of the government saying we're not
going to
overreach so that's what it sounded like
to me when the Supreme Court said we're
going to wipe away this Lower Court
ruling that didn't feel like they' made
a decision that felt like okay you guys
are doing a little bit more with the
government than the government needs to
do you know just cool it for a while
while we'll take a look at it if it
needs to be reversed we'll be the ones
to reverse it very adult very adult I
don't hate it but I'm cautious you know
could go the wrong way you never know
could be a signal it's going to go the
wrong way maybe but I think not I think
they're adults I think we're going to
get the right
outcome uh Anthony blinkin says the US
is quote ready to get involved in the
Israel Hamas War if the line is crossed
we won't
hesitate the
line well what's that
line does anybody know what the line
is because it seems to me that he just
created a standard that allows him to
engage the military of the United
States on an
opinion well I think that Line's been
crossed that's my
opinion if you don't say what the line
is
what are the odds that's going to be
crossed
100%
right uh of course they're going to
they're certainly going to violate a
line that doesn't
exist because somebody's going to say it
was violated no matter what happens so
obviously Hezbollah is going to be
active already are active so how much
activity is too much uh ground
Invasion I don't know uh number of
missiles what number of
missiles would be over the line I don't
know so that's a uh that's a scary
standard well I'm seeing today a bunch
of speculation that the Hamas attack in
Israel and specifically the way some
Democrats were not supporting Israel as
much as you know Jewish Democrats would
have hoped and many of us would have
hoped as well
um so there's some speculation that
there'll be a substantial move of Jewish
American voters from Democrat
Republican I say probably
not probably
not and the reason is that um your
choice of parties and even who you voted
for
has well for a long time I don't know
what it was before but it's really a
lifestyle Choice people are making
lifestyle Cho choices it's not even
who's the best president or anything
like that and I don't think that if you
were a Jewish American and all your
friends are Democrats and you hang
around with all the Democrats that's a
lot to ask of anybody to change under
those conditions that's a lot and
realistically people don't they'll just
keep doing what they're doing now that's
also helped by the fact that Biden is
being quite aggressive with our military
so if if Biden had not immediately put a
strike force uh right off the coast then
I think you might have seen some
Democrats who are Jewish say you know
what if you're not going to help us out
we're going to go to the party that will
but he
did so um I'm not going to complain that
he's toothless we don't know how it'll
play out but at the moment he's showing
some teeth and that that's probably what
Trump would have done and well it
probably wouldn't have gotten to this
point but that's another story um so my
prediction is opposite I don't think
it's going to change as much as you
think I do think that Trump will win
more Jewish votes than his other uh
times but I think it'll be a smalest
change of a smallish group of Americans
so I don't think it'll be and also the
concentrations of Jewish Americans would
be in such blue States
that I doubt it would make any
difference at all in
electoral go well what's the difference
if uh a few people in New York City vote
for Trump all right whoever he runs
against is still going to win New York
New York wouldn't make any
difference
so that's going on um here's a uh
persuasion tip for you there is a
persuasion word that I see used all the
time that doesn't work at all it's
Marxist and
Marxism here's the least persuasive
thing you could say about somebody that
person's a
Marxist I don't even know what it
means how how many people even know what
it
means you think you do you've got a few
words it's like oh it's like sort of
like a communist or a socialist or
something something like that right
Marxist is the most empty
useless um powerless nonpersuasion word
you could ever bring to the debate now I
don't know what it's a better word I
just know that every time I hear that
word I just want to leave the room
because I'm not in a room where anything
useful is happening as soon as I hear
the word I'm out nope whoever's talking
you have nothing to say now I'm not
saying you're wrong right I'm not saying
that
you know Marxism is not really driving a
lot of stuff like BLM of course it seems
to be they say it they say it directly
right but the public the ones you want
to persuade they don't know what a
Marxist is like vaguely they think it's
communist and then vaguely they think
well what you really mean is socialist
right and then they think you mean like
health care for everybody I kind of like
that right there there's nothing about
the word that's
visual or scary unless you're a
historian and you've studied it if you
studied it it's scary as hell so the
people who are using it are using their
own knowledge of it and how scary it is
to them as if other people have that
same knowledge and fear they don't to
them it's just a word that they don't
know what it means so if you want to
make that argument and it's a it's a
strong wrong direction to want to be
arguing about it's important you're
going to have to find better
words so
maybe
uh maybe word like uh red redistribution
of
wealth because would that be part of it
would it be uh killing the people in
power is that why you're afraid of are
you afraid that that Marxism leads to no
here here's what doesn't work if you say
Marxism leads to a bad economy people
don't know how to connect those dots
that's just just noise going in your
head and out you got to make it visual
or scary to somebody who actually
understands what would be scary about
it um and that's it it should be Visual
and scary everything else doesn't
work you know logic doesn't work facts
don't work for persuasion you just got
to scare people or put a picture in
their head because their visual sense is
their dominant
sense so I hadn't thought about it too
much but you tell me you tell me I know
that many of you here are better
informed than the average so you know
what a Marxist is a lot of you give me
the give me the one sentence or even two
words that tell me why a Marxist is bad
go why a Marxist is bad in the fewest
words
uh Liars Killing Fields bolic none of
this is working Communists nothing
thieves nothing theft tyranny nothing
weapons closed system nothing racism I
don't think so
redistribution corrupt
poverty uh scum thugs anti-
individualists
dogmatic uh
totalitarian homelessness brain dead
collapse anti- capitalist all empty
you're you're all shooting
blanks it's just pure blanks there's
nothing
there yeah it's no surprise that the
people on that uh with that see the
thing when you say
starvation I don't know how to connect
the
dots that sounds like a generic thing
you say oh well if you elect a
republican we're all going to
starve
I I don't see
starvation um and and also in America
people are not too worried about
starving yeah they're worried about
poverty but usually even poor people can
get food so so starvation is not an
active word in the United States because
we haven't experienced it it would be
very active in China if you said to
somebody in China hey watch out for your
Marxism you know it leads to starvation
they would actually have a um let's say
a social memory of actual
starvation so that would actually work
in China it would be persuasive but here
we don't have that that Fe that's just
like baked into our DNA like they do in
China because they're so close to the
starvation same with Ukraine the
ukrainians have a starvation in their
DNA from the past so they might actually
be really really incentivized by hearing
we don't want to let the marxists
in so um all all of your words I saw so
far either don't
connect to Marxist in a way that an
uninformed person would understand why
does this lead to that like I don't
really understand why this form of
government leads to that explain it to
me so it's too conceptual too many steps
and the fear is like five steps away
right well if you start with your
Marxism well that'll lead to this then
that'll lead to that and that'll lead to
that and then you're hungry doesn't work
too many steps you you need something as
simple as build the wall to keep the PE
the bad people from killing
you that's persuasion all right so um I
don't have a better
idea but the the one that um the one
that comes closest is that you're
incentivizing
failure
now that's not really a persuasive
sentence because there's nothing
visual but if you hear it it would be
hard to get it out of your head that
Marxism is incentivizing failure you're
paying people to fail because everybody
understands that leads to a bad place
you don't have to connect as many dots
yeah Marxism is where you pay people to
fail or something like that I mean I
could I I could do better
yeah I could do better but that's the
direction you want to take it you you
want to do a a two-word replacement for
Marxism that tells you exactly what the
problem is and I don't know even I don't
know what that is I think it's something
about incentives right well let me ask
this would you agree that what's wrong
with Marxism
is it has the wrong set of
incentives and therefore leads to
certain do all right so incentives is a
is a boring nerd word incentives doesn't
make anybody get off the couch hey hey
Bob if you vote for this candidate
they'll have better
incentives nothing right it's just empty
but could you find something that does
hit you emotionally that gets to those
backward
incentives could you find
a an anecdote a story a comparison a
metaphor something that makes that real
and you feel it snowball slippery slope
no too
conceptual well certain Doom is still
conceptual good
intentions good intentions with bad
incentives leads to
death good intentions with bad
incentives leads to
death now that has uh death I like
death because death is just an automatic
it's like poison you if you if you
associate death and poison actually
poison might
work Marxism is like
poison too simple
yeah Marxism is good
intentions with bad incentives that lead
to certain
death it's still a little too abstract I
don't have it yet I'm going to work on
that okay going to work on that part of
the problem is that capitalism is a hot
mess too so if you say
Marxism an alternative to
capitalism it's got some problems then
anybody else would say well so does the
other thing
so that doesn't
work all right and that ladies and
gentlemen concludes the best show you've
ever
seen um I'll try to figure out what's
wrong with my streaming on the xplatform
see if I can fix that but today we've
gone back to just the two iPad solution
one for YouTube and one for uh locals
and I'm going to say bye now to uh
YouTube thanks for joining
and uh see you tomorrow bye for
now
