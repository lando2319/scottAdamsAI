the unparallel pleasure dopamine hit the
day thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go oh it's a Christmas miracle how good
that taste and I get to do it with all
of you my favorite part of the day by
the way I don't know if I've ever told
you this is literally my favorite part
of the
day maybe it's because I like doing the
talking and having you do the
listening maybe it's not a good sign
that this is my favorite part of the day
but it is so I caused more trouble than
I ever imagined Yesterday by
recommending a movie
who in the world thought that that would
cause
hate I got more Hate by recommending a
movie I like than just by anything
that's happened to me this year since I
got cancelled and here's the
problem um a number of people said that
I must be doing it for
pay so I I I finally said I likeed the
movie I like the movie red one it's a
Christmas movie and and I got accused I
can't tell you how many people accuse me
of doing it for money and being a
sellout and and I thought really yeah
when did it become unusual to say you
like a movie on social media and
somebody said you know why would I be
delving into this trivial stuff you know
why would you be talking about trivial
things to which I
thought is it your first day on social
media social media is like 90%
trivia 10% substance so I I can't have a
little bit of a little bit of Christmas
trivia anyway so and a and a curiosity
uh since movies of course are highly
subjective there's no such thing as a
good movie or a bad
movie if I could teach you one thing
it's this there's no such thing as good
art or bad art there's no such thing as
a good comic or a bad one there's no
such thing as a good movie or a bad one
there there is such thing as did people
go and like it or not if people like it
it's good so if you're looking at the
comments and you see that 80% of the
people commenting say yeah that was a
good movie good good recommendation I
enjoyed
it a comment that doesn't make sense is
that was a bad
movie it's not a bad movie if 80% people
liked
it if 80% like it that's a good movie by
definition your your your own
your own opinion to the movie is just
your own opinion it's not some kind of
universal standard so out of
curiosity uh I followed up today just to
cause more
trouble which other people are saying
I'm trying to you know just get
engagement money but no I'm actually
curious when when I when I ask a
question it's usually because I actually
think it'd be an interesting question so
my my question was if you think red one
is not a great movie like I do I think
it's a great movie uh what would be your
favorite movie recently so I asked the
people who said they didn't like red one
what movies do you like
recently and most of my answers were
movies that were 30 to 50 years
old 30 to 50 years old that's what
people answered with their favorite
recent movie was 30 to 50 years
old but there are some people who who
mentioned a little bit more recent
movies for example Schindler's List and
and the Sha Shank Redemption were high
on people's list of all-time best
movies do you know what I think of those
two movies it's two movies that make you
feel like you're in prison Andor a
concentration camp in Nazi Germany and
makes you feel that the entire length of
the
movie and that's your favorite
movie who wants to feel like they're in
the most horrible prison situation for
three hours in a row popcorn oh look
what they're doing to him now bet that
hurt
oh so I'm not
judging I'm not
judging but uh it was hilarious to see
what people's favorite movies were cuz
some of them are so dark that I I
actually think that Schindler's List
should be
illegal and I mean that actually
literally Schindler's List I don't think
that should be legal as a movie because
uh I got PTSD from it so I suffered for
years of having flashbacks to to the
movie now I get that you know we should
all be informed of how bad things were
at different times I get that we should
I'll be informed but did I have to get
PTSD like they couldn't just give me the
details and I wouldn't be able to figure
out that that was pretty
bad yeah I think that should I I
wouldn't I would block somebody from
watching that movie if they if they
wanted to but it was wellmade it was
just destructive to human human
beings anyway so there's news
today a little bit any anybody want to
talk about some news on
Christmas I'll try to keep it light okay
it is mostly an excuse just to hang out
today so here here's the uh theme for
today the theme for today today is
doesn't really matter what's happening
in the
world he'll just give me something to
talk about while while you're talking to
each other usually in the comments so
just make sure you have an amazing day
today if I can help out by keeping you
some company
and by the way out for the local
subscribers um I will be back this
evening so 7 7:30 I'll tell you the time
this time I don't usually tell you the
time but tonight I'll shoot for
7:30 um eastern time Eastern Time 7:30
tonight and we'll we'll hang out so
there are a lot of people I found out
who literally don't have any human
contact on all of Christmas Day and
we're going to fix that I will be your
human
contact all right um so here so so the
news is all just kind of light and funny
today some of it is
anyway um here's my first news
item does anybody want to make a bat
that the Drone activity over New Jersey
is way down on
Christmas because if the Drone activity
is way down on Christmas
that definitely Narrows down what the
drones might be do you agree it's
probably they're probably not Iranian
drones and they're probably not from
another planet because they don't they
don't uh do Christmas I don't know if
the Chinese drones
would that might be a hybrid situation
but uh let's let's watch today we're
going to ask we're going to ask Erica to
look outside tonight in the man cave and
see what the Drone activity looks like
CU one of us one one of us here um I
don't know if Eric is here yet but one
of us is in New Jersey and has been
taking pictures of the Drone activity so
we'll have a pretty good
Baseline we'll see if it went down today
that'll tell us something all right uh
Biden signed a new law designating the
bald eagle as our national
bird now I'm glad he's getting I'm glad
he's doing the important stuff before he
leaves because you might not know this
but the Bal Eagle was not the national
bird which came as a surprise to me if
you would asked me Scott who is the
national bird I would have said bald
eagle but it turns out it
wasn't how how many of you are blown
away by the fact that the bald eagle was
not the national bird your whole
life did you know that it wasn't the
national bird
what now it was close to that it was a
national
emblem so back in uh 1782 Congress
decided that it would be our national
emblem but not the national
bird now I feel like I've been lied to
since 1782 I thought it was a national
bird but um the other thing that offends
me about this story is that they called
a bald eagle a bald eagle really
really I thought we were more woke than
that I don't call it a bald eagle no I
call it a feather challenged eagle
feather challenged not
bald for the people who don't understand
how humor works I'm not actually
literally
suggesting that bald eagles don't have
any feathers on their head this is just
a joke
and if you do not understand jokes it
must be a very terrible life for you but
we're not going to be talking about that
for now for now we're going to be
talking about other things so moving
on so in other hilarious stories
Greenland has decided to beef up its uh
military security uh so Denmark which
owns Greenland said uh that because of
Trump's Sab rattling they were going to
they were going to substantially
increase the security of their
country
um but did you know that the United
States has a uh military defense
agreement with
Greenland that means that uh any attack
on Greenland is considered something
that the U US military is already
committed to respond
to I'm not surprised just because they
hemosphere is in but I didn't know that
so apparently we would be all in if
somebody attacked Greenland now that you
if you're laughing who's going to attack
Greenland that's actually a possibility
now because as the Arctic melts it's
going to be a big fight between Russia
and China and US and Canada and Denmark
I guess about who owns what you know
because once the ice melts there's going
to be a lot of sea travel and a lot of
claiming of territory and whatnot up
there so whoever owns Greenland's got
you know a good solid base to operate
down of so it probably makes a
difference uh but they've uh they're
going to increase their security they're
going to have long range drones more
inspection ships and sled
patrols and they're going to upgrade one
of their airports so it can land a
fighter
jet you know when Trump first brought it
up I thought I think we can take
Greenland yeah we we didn't really win
in Vietnam or Afghanistan or Iraq didn't
really go the way we wanted it to but
but I really thought we could take
Greenland like I I have confidence in
the military of the United States I I
feel like we can take that
Greenland but uh we're a little too
late too late they' beefed up their
security I mean we were probably going
to send some inter
inter InterContinental missiles at them
but now now they have extra sled
patrols so how are you going to get past
that extra sled patrols and uh over the
next several years they'll build a
better airport so I don't know how you
could fight that so we better give up on
our uh our dream of conquering Greenland
because they've got new sled patrols and
that'll stop us
now actually the reason they're they're
stepping up the
security it's even funnier it's the
Trump
effect so because Trump made noise about
Greenland being a national security risk
Denmark said oh wait you're actually
right Greenland is a national security
risk for everybody because of the Arctic
opening up so they're they're beefing up
of security which is sort of laughingly
small amount
uh is because they're trying to respond
to the fact that Russia and China might
be a threaded sometime soon so that's
the Trump effect again so here
again Trump's mere existence and and
statements make other countries do what
we wanted them to do otherwise now
apparently this is also happening with
NATO right now so Estonia and Lithuania
I guess uh are all saying we better we
better massively increase
are NATO spending because if America
ever pulls out we're in
trouble so Europe is actually saying hey
we we better make step up and make sure
we're taking care of ourselves because
we're relying too much on America which
is Trump's message Trump's message is
you're relying too much on us step up
your spending and they're just doing it
anyway in anticipation this is the Trump
effect the the Trump effect is very real
uh it seems like every country is making
fairly substantial
adjustments just just to accommodate the
fact that he's a completely different
character and more effective in so many
ways that they have to change things
when Biden came into office do you
remember anybody making any changes in
other countries I don't did any other
country do anything differently I don't
think so but as soon as Soon As Trump
comes along oh we better change
everything we're doing in the right
direction now one of the funny questions
going along around social media was if
uh if the United States takes over
Greenland uh what will we name it now
obviously we would just keep it the same
name Greenland but it's funny to think
about and so people had suggestions like
meal land and others but uh my
suggestion I think is the best
we if United States takes it over under
Trump's
Administration uh we should change the
name from
Greenland to orang
land Greenland to orangel land yeah yeah
you wish you thought of
it all right what else is
happening uh apparently according to the
bite uh The Washington Post is trying to
get some new uh leadership in there to
run the paper and and the people who are
applying or had been considered for the
job are pulling out because they don't
like the question they get when they
interview and the question is how would
they use AI in technology basically to
make the paper more successful and all
these newspaper people don't know
anything about technology or
Ai and they're just like I'm out I'm
out so I would uh I would go further and
say if if Jeff Bezos wants the
Washington Post to be more of a
technically driven you know
Enterprise you can't hire an editor you
can't hire somebody who's been in
journalism their whole life you're GNA
you're G to have to gu somebody like a
you know a vake or an Elon Musk or you
could have to give somebody who really
really understands technology anything
short of that would
be why
bother yeah yeah a regular newspaper
editor is not going to be bringing in a
new technology way of doing things
that's just not going to happen that
would be like asking a
bookstore in
1985 to build build
Amazon bookstores don't know how to
build Amazon you newspaper people don't
know how to do
AI all right
um
Politico has a story with this headline
Elon musos quote move fast and break
things attitude clashes with
Washington now weirdly I've been hearing
the following complaint from people in
my own life you know people that I
interact with people are are saying that
uh Elon
Musk unique among all human beings is
the only person won't be able to figure
out that the governments operate
differently than businesses and some
adjustments might need to be
made to which I say okay let me
understand this right you're saying that
Elon Musk unique among all 8 billion
people would be the only one he'd be the
only one who couldn't see what every one
of us see which is government runs
different differently than business
secondly if you believe that move fast
and break things won't work in
government what is your basis for saying
that uh what data are you looking at
what experience are you relying on that
move fast and break things won't work in
government now I would agree it might
not might not work in every situation
but do you really think that Elon Musk
looks at a brand new situation and says
I think I'll treat this the way I
treated a completely different
thing Elon Musk you think that Elon
Musk is uniquely unable to see that
every situation is different and
therefore you must
adjust Elon
Musk like why am I even having that
conversation with multiple people what
what does Politico
think he
is how could you watch him do what he's
done so far
what he's done so far and think he can't
navigate a new
situation he's literally the most famous
Navigator of new situations in the
history of the entire
planet that'd be like me sitting at home
saying you what does Arnold schwar know
about
bodybuilding I
mean he I think he was working in
construction before
that so anyway that's a that's a weird
criticism I didn't even read the
Politico article CU When I saw the
headline I was like oh there's nothing
here for
me uh Mike Ben who's working on
Christmas Eve uh found the receipts to
prove the following now if you if you
haven't followed Mike Benz you're
absolutely confused about the real world
I mean he for the first time all the
stuff I didn't understand about the
world at least in terms of how
governments and the United States are
operating finally it all came together
because what he does is he describes how
the CIA has all these cutouts that
control other countries and more
recently they tried to use that trick to
control the United States directly which
they're not supposed to
do uh but let me just tell you what he
discovered recently just the other day
so as he often describes there's a
enormous
entity uh that the United States
controls and funds it's a US entity
called us Aid us
Aid now if you heard us a and you knew
it operates to influence other countries
and you knew it was uh it was hugely
funded I forget their budget but it's
gigantic wouldn't you assume that it was
like 4 and a
just because the name of it us Aid and
it's and it's externally focused it's
not it's not Aid to the US it's us Aid
to other countries is what it sounds
like but it turns out it's nothing like
that its mission is the mission of usaid
is to act innocent while overthrowing
other countries on the be on behalf of
the CIA so it's a a regime change entity
trying to look like something else but
basically it's just a CIA
weapon and did you know according to
Mike Ben that AOC and Liz Cheney were
both spawned by the US
Aid they they both have a prehistory
that went through US Aid do you know
what that
means well the suggestion is that AOC
and Liz chainer are both uh essentially
CIA influenced operatives
uh and that they're not exactly
operating for the benefit of the country
so much as maybe the benefit of the
CIA now that's a big leap it's a big
leap it it's a leap from they had uh you
know important contacts with USA like
extensive ones so much so that at one
time they were certainly working with
the CIA and you could argue for them
but is it also
true that uh that the USA and the CIA
still have their hooks in them and and
they're just puppets for those guys
could be could be it would explain
everything you say it would explain 100%
of your observations about the two of
them but there's no direct evidence of
that there's no direct evidence but
that's also how it works the way it
works is hey there's no direct
evidence so I'm not going to say that
they're CIA
operatives I will say that Mike Ben's
you know research on them it's public
you you can see the documents he shows
them to you you can see for yourself uh
but he makes a strong case he makes a
strong case that they grew an of an
entity that isn't let's say exclusively
patriotic
but well maybe in its own special way I
I guess if you get pulled into that
world you always think you're on the
side of goodness even if you're
not so that was
interesting um I continue to uh enjoy
watching the
Democrat experts talking about why
things went wrong and getting everything
wrong uh but the what I call the Doom
spiral of the Democrat Party is way way
more entertaining than I
expected I I knew the Democrats were
going to have some you know dissension
and Chaos if they lost the election
which they did I didn't know it would
destroy the entire Democratic party for
I don't know how long but the the
question and and I've joked yesterday
that the the smart people who are
Democrats have decided that the only way
they can recover is by copying Trump
that's right the Democrat experts the
smart people went from the only thing we
have to say is is orange man bad that's
all we have to say Trump's worse and
they often said it directly by the way
they would often say sure our our guy or
our Our Lady later may have some issues
but at least they're not Trump right it
was just an anti-trump message and now
they now they've decided that they have
to have a Trump copycat message to win
so they literally went from anti-trump
to can we copy everything he did that
worked and that happened in like days so
how
artificial was their entire their entire
program was artificial it wasn't
anything that smart people believe in
because they would to change their minds
overnight it must have been that
everything they were doing was seen as a
tactic
as opposed to a good idea for the public
and when they realize their tactic
didn't work you can change a
tactic so a tactic can change on a
dime but your core values aren't going
to change on a
dime so when you see that they're that
what they think they need to do to win
changed on a dime do you think that had
anything to do with core values I doubt
it it suggests to me they didn't believe
the core values that were being espoused
by their own part party but they were
too cowardly to say it or too
loyal I guess you could go both ways too
cowardly or too loyal to their team ends
up being it looks the
same
but here's the
question H how in the world are they
going to recover so let me lay out the
situation for the Democrats and you tell
me if you think they can recover because
we we kind of ordinarily imagine that if
Republicans have a bad election they can
recover if Democrats have a bad election
they can recover because that's all
we've ever seen you know that usually
there's always a comeback but there's a
real interesting situation now with the
Democrats that I haven't seen before so
here's my description number one
Democrats have no leader would you agree
now we've talked before about you know
Obama you know secretly pulling the
strings but then other people say no
it's the advisors the advisers are
secretly pulling the strings and other
people say I think it's the clintons or
the Deep State or the the CIA or it's
the military-industrial complex or it's
uh it's Israel that everybody's got some
idea of who's controlling the president
but would you agree that the Democrats
have no identifiable
leader I mean hake Jeff says some things
once in a while but it's in the context
of his current job he's not he doesn't
feel like a leader of the
party um they also have no popular
policies just think about that they have
no leader and they have no popular
policies because they got beaten and the
the polls showed that the public didn't
like any of their top policies now I'm
talking about the top ones once you get
down to the you know fifth and sixth
preference
then they start getting some support
like abortion for example but if you
look at the top three it's just all
Trump and so they would just have to so
how are they going to win with no leader
no charismatic leader uh no popular
policies let's say the top three
priorities they also have no
Unity uh at the moment the Republicans
are completely unified under Trump even
Mitt Romney says oh it's Trump's party
the Republican party is Trump's party
and when mitt robney said it he didn't
say it like an
insult he did not say it like an insult
which is pretty remarkable pretty
remarkable so somehow Trump found Unity
by simply
success boy if you want to unify people
try being
successful that that'll get it done uh
so he's got
Unity um and then the Democrats don't
seem to have any positive messaging so
Trump's talking about you know the
Golden Age and how great we're going to
be and the Democrats mostly talk about
how bad we've
been those are not
competitive how great we're going to be
is a strong message how bad we used to
be and we have to beat ourselves up for
that is you can't win with
that and then of course the entire party
is Dei infected meaning that uh their
their their enthusiasm for
diversity should all things being equal
 their effectiveness forever
because they can't back up from
diversity and Dei there's no way out
like once you get there you're going to
have to die in that hell you can't back
out but the Republicans don't have that
problem at
all and wokeness the whole idea of
wokeness it appears to have just turned
into a joke like I don't I don't even
see Democrats supporting wokness anymore
they all seem to have said oh this was a
losing theme wasn't good for the country
you know it it totally destroyed the
Democratic party and they're right it
did it totally destroyed the Democratic
party but possibly in a way they can't
come back which I worry about because I
want I want a competitive
party and Gloria Romero former state
senator of California said the Democrats
were in complete collapse now at this
point that story complete collapse which
is shared by other people their opinion
that's forming a
narrative and the Democrats of course
like everybody that they'll seize on
whatever
narrative seems to capture things and
other people are talking about so if
enough Democrats say we're in complete
collapse that's how they will see their
party it's not going to take too many
pundits to use those words complete
collapse or words like it for the
mainstream to say yeah we're in we're in
complete collapse and then it becomes
self fulfilling so they're definitely
circling the
drain um
and I I feel like I've switched a little
bit from yeah the less of them the
better to well oh we we may have
overcorrected
if we
overcorrect then we don't have a good
fight I mean our system depends on a
nice fair fight so you know I hope I
hope Democrats can come back but only if
they're competing with good ideas this
time if they're competing with
 we don't need
it
um Newsmax was uh reporting uh on Trump
how he did with young people and he said
uh quote we got the highest vote ever
for a republican with young people Trump
said uh my son Baron said dad you got to
talk to this one and that one he likes
Joe Rogan a lot he said dad you got to
do an interview he's uh he has a feel
for young people I might have to start
thinking about Tik Tock meaning keeping
Tik Tock so we can benefit from it
um here in my opinion is Trump's least
appreciated skill
and when I say skill I mean way above
average like skill skill like you
haven't seen before skill his most
important skill is at the age of 78 he
is a really good
listener have you heard that before
because the the bad guys the Democrats
were all about Trump's a
narcissist so he's not even going to
listen to you or he's going to make a
decision based on the last person to
talk to him
or which is just laughable uh or or he's
going to use his narcissism and he's
just going to do things that are good
for
him which is completely at odds with the
observable fact that he's the best
listener I've ever seen in politics does
he understand what his base
wants
yes yes I've never seen anybody
understand what their Bas wants more
than Trump understands what his base
wants he knows how to joke with us he
knows how to tease us he knows how to
get us interested he knows how to
inspire he understands his base but it
goes further than that when he talks
about listening to Baron he was taking
political advice from a teenager do you
know why why was he taking political
advice like important political advice
from a teenager let me tell you why CU
he listened to him he listened to him
like genuinely listened to him and he
heard things he'd never heard before and
then he probably checked it with other
people and then he he operationalized it
put it into
practice
now I see this everywhere and and by the
way people who have talked to him in
person will say the same thing I think
every one of them says the same thing
that he absolutely listens and I I'll
tell you from my I've told you this
before but my one experience where I
talked to him personally when he invited
me to the White House in
2018 and I think he was just the reason
I was there he was just uh it was a slow
summer 2018 not much news and I think he
was just firming up support with the
people who were public supporters so I
got an
invitation and if you can imagine this
it's like it's beyond imagination
imagine me sitting in the Oval Office
like I'm on the other side of the desk
and I'm just chatting with him about
nothing in
particular nothing in particular I mean
I'm not going to give you details of the
conversation but um it kind of went from
one topic to another because I wasn't
there for a specific purpose but here's
the part that will blow you
away a good a good percentage of it was
him asking questions about my life
and my career life and how Dilbert
worked and how many papers was in and
you know how that was how was that was
working out and he was completely
engaged or or it felt like it so imagine
imagine somebody who's got the weight of
the entire world on their shoulders and
you sit in front of them and for 30
minutes you feel like you're the only
person in the room that he cares
about like it was it was amazing
so as a
listener it it's like his top skill and
he's got a lot of skills but that might
be his top skill so when you see the the
baron story about he got his advice from
a
teenager that's that's more like who he
is that's not the
exception uh meanwhile in that hellscape
called Europe apparently starting July 6
uh
um no apparently that already started
there's some kind of Technology they're
putting in the cars in Europe that will
make your car beep if you exceed the
speed limit so your car will start
scolding you for driving
fast and uh the funny thing is that the
that guy who gets a lot of bad press in
Great Britain that the or Theory Breeden
guy the anti-free speech guy or the the
censorship guy let's call them that
he now he wants your car to be scolding
you I'll tell you the reasons not to go
to Europe just keep adding
up anyway
um I got some technology
stories but uh I I thought because it's
a close to year end I would give a
little review of my uh best predictions
that that involved Trump all right so
clearly I'm better at predicting Trump
related things than other things for
whatever reason
and I wanted to just give you my best
list because if you haven't heard them
all at once it's different so these are
all things you've heard but if you don't
hear them in a list at the same time
it's it won't feel the same so so of
course you know that I kind of got a lot
of
notoriety because in 2015 I I I said
that not only would he win but he would
change how we saw
reality now those were two of the best
predictions of all time that Trump would
win when people thought he was a joke
and that he would not just win he would
change
reality I said that 2016 did he change
reality the way you see reality did it
change the way you see
reality oh my God
now we understand that the news was
never a legitimate
industry I had no idea how bad the fake
news was but he let us see it and he was
on it early now why did he see it before
the rest of us because he was in it he
knew how often the news was fake about
himself so he knew the news was fake
because it was fake about him for years
so he let us in on the secret the news
is fake and then we could start to see
it
once you see the news is fake you start
to realize that everything from the
Russia collusion is more than an
accident and that you know there there
are forces behind the the curtain who
are orchestrating things and then you
start to understand Soros and suddenly
everything starts coming
together right and then you start
thinking the experts might not know
things you know he calls a climate
change of hoax and the first time you
hear it you're like oh god
really oh my God I was supporting that
guy and you know now he's saying the
science is like their their main thing
is a hoax and then the more you see
about climate change the more you think
oh yeah he might be right about that too
and then you find that all experts who
have
bosses are
lying all experts who have bosses are
lying and then you learn that every
organization that reaches a certain
scale is fully
corrupt just all of them I didn't see
that coming I didn't know all of them
were corrupt but it seems to be that all
of them were
corrupt so he did change reality I also
said in 2016 that he was one of the best
communicators not just
persuaders but but one of the best
communicators we've ever seen and people
laughed and they said Scott he's got it
they say he has a sixth grade
vocabulary we think he has mental
illness and I said no that sixth grade
that sixth grade vocabulary you don't
see what he's doing he's talking the way
people talk he's communicating and on
their level that's how you do it that's
the right way to do it if you don't even
recognize it as a technique and and you
think you must have mental illness you
are so far from understanding how things
work you're you're just Flying Blind
there today would you agree that even
the people who are on his enemies list
would you agree that even they say he's
the best Communicator
around you would that they basically say
he out communicated us I mean the
Democrats are kind of being honest about
that and I would say that his slogans
his summaries his ability to provoke
make you think make you think
differently reframe things you never
seen anything like it he's the best you
know Reagan was
amazing I think Trump's
better I think Trump's better and Reagan
was
amazing but Trump's a little bit better
he's the best I think we've ever seen
um so here here's what else I predicted
um by the way we along with the you know
our idea of reality changing the
simulation Theory and the fact that
string theory doesn't look like it
works um and then some maybe even things
about aliens I don't know but certainly
the way we look at reality is completely
different since Trump uh I predicted
that after Trump lost in 2020 even
though his reputation was in the toilet
and he was being called a traitorous uh
insurrectionist I predicted Against the
Grain that he would get more popular
every day every
day and he did and he just reached his
Peak
popularity he got more popular every
day um I I predicted uh incorrectly so
this is my biggest incorrect one that
Russia would not invade
Ukraine and my reasoning was that if
they did it wouldn't work and all the
experts were saying oh Scott it's going
to take two weeks Russia will just roll
into ke there's nothing to stop him
basically and I said no I think drones
are going to stop
them and today it's a drone War so uh
Ukraine was reporting they did their
first all robot
attack today I'm going to say I don't
believe that's
true I I think they're alleged all robot
attack
was just
propaganda um good propaganda well done
because in war propaganda is one of the
tools it's one of the tools of War so if
you judge wartime propaganda as to
whether it's true or false you're in the
wrong
conversation wartime propaganda is just
supposed to work or not work true or
false
isn't who cares it's a war you're just
trying to win the war if it works it
works that's the end of it the doesn't
need to be
true so Ukraine came up with this great
propaganda that they're so Advanced with
their robots and their drones that they
can Now launch all robot
attacks which
conveniently uh sends the message that
sure they're running out of human beings
because they're all dead but that won't
stop their war effort because they'll
just replace human beings with robot all
robot
Warriors so would look at that first
report as
propaganda I I don't think I don't think
you're going to see them you know
duplicating their all robot attack and
suddenly taking Crimea back with robots
that that's not going to happen the the
the story about that is way ahead of the
reality I feel very confident in saying
that although the reality will certainly
be all robots there's no doubt that it
will be we we'll have robot war but not
in Ukraine and not this year
so uh but my best so that was my best
prediction about Ukraine is that they
would use drones and technology that
Russia had not seen yet to make it
impossible to hold
ground and I thought they really they're
going to roll tanks they're going to
bring tanks into Ukraine and they think
any of them are going to survive and
sure enough most of the tanks got taken
out so I beat all of the military
experts on uh not the question of
whether Putin would
invade but what would happen if he
did um I predicted in 2019 and most of
you did too that Biden's brain was shot
and there was no way he could
last to the end of his term so I beat
the medical doctors the medical experts
in my um my prediction about uh Biden's
brain I beat the military experts on how
Ukraine would Faire if Russia
attacked I beat all the political
experts when I said that you're going to
be surprised how much the Hispanics like
Trump and I said if you live and work
among the Hispanic Community as I do you
will see that they're they're just
basically
Republicans they they love their family
they like hard work they're willing to
do it uh and their religion
and uh yesterday I was watching a clip
of a Hispanic American saying yeah they
I think the Democrats
underestimated our Catholic beliefs that
are just closer to Republican so I alone
in the entire world predicted that
although Trump was being demonized for
his border policies that he would gain
in Hispanic
votes I alone in the entire world Prett
predicted that now I say I alone I mean
in the just the political pundit class
there might be plenty of you predicted
it
too um I also predicted that Trump would
pick up black votes mostly among
men long before it happened so at the
same time that people were saying you
know fine people hoax and everything
else seemed impossible I
said he might not win the black vote but
watch what he does with black men sure
enough black men I also told you way
before anybody was on to
it that the Democrats were becoming the
party of
women and men who were willing to go
along with the
women and sure enough they became the
party of
women
um I I also predicted that the fine
people hoax wasn't like the others
that it was the tent pole hoax and if
you could pull out the tent pole the
entire tent would come
down and I think that's what happened I
think that uh you know with the amazing
work of Steve Cortez and Joel Pollock
and and I the three Horsemen of the anti
fine people hoax um I think we just
stayed on it and stayed on it and stayed
on it
until most people knew it was a hoax on
the
right would you agree most people know
that's a hoax on the right and didn't
really know it right away it took a
while for for that to become the common
view on the right it was some people saw
right away but before it was a common
view had to be
persuaded and then I think that's the
main reason that the I'll call them the
common sense um switchovers switched
you've heard uh Joe Rogan say the fine
people hoax affected him I think you've
heard Elon Musk maybe maybe saxs David
Sachs uh so there
are several very notable people who were
flipped by that one hoax when it got
debunked when they realized it was
debunked and I was right it turned out
to be the 10 pole hoax it was the one
that allowed you to see that the others
were hoaxes cuz once you see that they
pulled that off then you can see that if
the news could pull off that hoax so
easily debunked and they still pulled it
off they still pulled it off so much so
that that Biden ran on that message
that's how well they pulled it off so
once that got pulled out especially
after Snopes debunked it I think that
was like the Domino that just that just
destroyed the Democrat Party I think
that I think the fine people folks
allowed the highly credible people such
as the Elon musks um to come
over uh RFK Jr to probably uh I I think
it allowed the common sense people to
say you know
what we like these things not everything
but we like these things that Trump is
saying we can work with
that so that was the biggest thing and I
think it was probably hugely
helpful when I created the original hoax
list the list of 12 or so hoaxes that
later got expanded to about 20 of them
um and it became
memeable and for the first time because
the the hoaxes had names by then you got
your Russia collusion hoax you got your
you got your fine people hoax your
drinking bleach hoax they had names so
naming them and putting them in a list
allowed it to be memeable but more
importantly it allowed you to see that
this is a giant scop
and that the Democrats and the
CIA uh and uh and the media were all one
entity running scops one after another
and once you saw
that you can't unsee it because that
what it's like creates vision for you
you can actually see it
happening
so I'm I I got to say I'm pretty proud
of those predictions but if you'd like
to be good at predicting
too uh learning persuasion is probably
what gets you
there because persuasion is predictive
you know specifically if I see the best
Persuader in the world enter enter a
field I know where things are going to
go oh it doesn't matter what any anyone
else is doing the best Persuader just
entered the
field all right
um Bill Gates was calling for antivaxers
to be censored by
Ai and he questions uh he says
questioning vacines is tmount to
inciting
violence so he wants the free speech of
antivaxers to be
limited in a pretty serious
way all right you
win for how many years have I been
saying why are you calling Bill Gates
evil
when he's just trying to make the world
a better place with all his Charities
now I I get it that he was you know he
was pretty tough when he was running
Microsoft and did some things you think
are
anti-competitive I get that but when he
switched over to you know charity or
philanthropy being his main thing and he
started developing better toilets for
Africa and cleaner water and stuff I
thought how in the world are you
criticize izing somebody working
fulltime to make the world better
especially in the worst places like
Africa how in the world is that evil and
people would say oh the vaccines the
vaccines something about the vaccines
and then I would say something like well
I don't know that whole
story
but you know are you saying all vaccines
are
bad because at the time I thought he was
just trying to help and he thought
vaccines would make a difference
then people would Sayes but he used
Africa as a a guinea
pigs and sometimes it didn't work out
and people died from the
vaccines to which I
say how do you think any medicine gets
tested at some point it gets tested on
people and you're going to have to find
a place where the people say yes so
using Africans as guinea pigs to me is
just a subset of all big farm that uses
human beings as guinea pigs that's sort
of their whole business model they they
use the guinea pigs as guinea pigs and
then if it you know or rats and then if
it works on the
animals they use human beings as guinea
pigs that's what it is so I said to
myself aren't you making too much of
this Africa thing no I get that it was a
mistake and I get that it it turned out
horribly wrong for way too many people I
get that but is does that mean it was it
was poorly intentioned or is it just
built into the nature of vaccines that
every once in a while you're going to
get a a real bad result and we all know
that and it's just sort of built into
the risk management of it so I had a
million different ways to say I think
you're misinterpreting this Bill Gates
guy just because he's seemingly creepy
you know and maybe his social life and
his connections Epstein make you
uncomfortable that doesn't mean his full
philanthropy is all evil come
on and then I hear this story today that
he wants the antivaxers to be censored
by Ai and he's questioning whether
vaccine questioning is inciting
violence and I'm
out I'm
out yeah um I'm not going to I'm not
going to review any of the old
arguments because this is all I need to
know
this is all I need to know once I see
that he's all in on the vaccines whether
they work or not
basically um I don't need to know
anything else so it it took a while for
me to see something that I considered
unambiguous because all the other
complaints about them they always had
that ambiguity well you know maybe
you're you're misinterpreting this well
you you can't read his mind I would say
you can't read his mind but in this case
you don't really need to read any
Minds this
is I don't even have to say what this is
you you probably have the same opinion I
do so he's on his own now if uh if Bill
if Bill Gates Rises or Falls or helps
the world or doesn't it's all him I'm
not going to back him on anything from
now on I'm
out um RFK Jr was asking on a
theovon um interview not too long ago he
he noted that Bill Gates and the CIA
were were co-hosting an event in 2019
and he said to Theo quote you have a New
York City Bill Gates hosting a Corona
virus pandemic simulation his co-host is
uh AEL Haynes the deputy director of the
CIA what is the CIA doing at a public
health Forum they don't do Public Health
they do
cudas
couat to which I say um yeah why would
Bill Gates and the CIA be hosting a
Corona virus event in
2019 which was right before the Corona
virus got
out none of that sounds
good none of that sounds good I'm not
comfortable with
that so again if this had been a year
ago I would have said well CIA probably
has an interest in this and Bill Gates
is trying to help so maybe they just got
together and today I say I don't like
any of this I don't know what it means I
don't like it so I'm with you on
that
um so there's a new battery breakthrough
lithium ion battery will double the
according to Tech
Explorer so the reason I tell you
there's a breakthrough in batteries
every single day is because there's a
breakthrough in batteries every single
day and what you should get from this is
the world is going to be really
different and and Technology and
Engineering are really focusing in the
right place because if you can get
batteries that are twice as good five
times as good really Everything Changes
it changes the economics
of almost every industry from and every
residence as
well so it's a big deal
um so there's this uh airline crash in
aeran somebody got on film and there's
some kind of weird structural
failures that didn't seem to
be the proximate cause of the crash but
maybe it was but it's a mystery so it
looks like a whole bunch of almost like
an explosion from outside may have
ripped a whole bunch of little holes in
the fuse Lodge which might have been the
original problem so nobody knows what
those holes are caused by but there are
a bunch of them and they're randomly
scattered on the outside of the plane to
me it looks like
shrapnel that happened from the
outside oh wait I'm seeing something
here what about Ben
Shapiro I I can't go backwards in the
comments they won't back
up so your your comment about the find
people hoax and Ben Shapiro I couldn't
read it as it went by I saw you were
trying to flag me
desperately but uh I'll watch now if you
want to put it back but it'll take about
30 seconds for it to show
up all right well I'm not going to see
that one I guess um if somebody saw that
you can put it in the locals
feed if it was important it l it looked
like it might have been some good point
that I was missing so if I was missing
something important I wanted to back up
and get it all right well look for
that so we don't know what that was but
it's a mystery of why that plane went
down meanwhile over in Saudi Arabia you
know they're building that uh miles long
city called gnome I think so it's the
biggest construction site in the world
and so it's basically this straight
line uh build of businesses mostly
businesses maybe some residents um and
here's the here's the thing that makes
news so they're replacing the number of
the workers with robots so that's why I
got in the news because the robots are
coming in but apparently
21,000 foreign workers
uh Ben Shapiro the grand zero of TDS oh
so somebody's telling me that Ben
Shapiro beli the fine people hoax at
first well there's nothing wrong with
believing it at
first see here here's the standard that
you should all
adopt if if if your complaint is
somebody got something wrong at the
first and then when better information
was available they revised their opinion
that should be a compliment to the
person it shouldn't be an insult because
I got something wrong at
first the the very best thing a person
can do is adjust from wrong to
right if you tell me that Ben Shapiro
with bad information got something wrong
and then with good information got
something right I say kudos to Ben Shiro
that to me sounds like just a compliment
to his intelligence flexibility and open
mind mindness so did you mean to
compliment him because that that came
that comes across as a compliment or is
this just another another anti-semitic
rant because his last name is Shapiro
and he's Jewish so you got to you got to
shove that into every topic to find
something that goes that fits your
little preconceived anti-semitic frame
is that what we're
doing sometimes it's hard to sort out
how much is a political opinion and how
much is Just Pure
anti-semitic
garbage because I got a real question on
that
one are we all on the same page You can
disagree with Ben Shapiro all you
want but if he improves his opinion with
better information he's still the
smartest guy in the game like he's
smarter than I am and I don't I don't
say that a lot right yeah I think you
would agree you don't hear that a lot
but no he's smarter than I am so if he
and I disagree and it's not based on
some obvious values or religious
difference I'm going to stop what I'm
doing I'm going to listen to what he
says and I'm going to listen to his
evidence and I'm going to definitely
question my own opinion if he disagrees
with me uh I love that there are people
in the world who if they disagree with
me I will stop on a dime say oh oh oh
you know Naval would be one he'd be at
the top of my list if Naval said
something that was opposite of what I
thought I would stop what I was doing
and say what what like where's this
coming from Ben Shapiro is another one
Jordan Peterson's another
one um you could probably come up with a
few more on the on the legal side uh
Jonathan turle or dtz if they disagree
with me I immediately change my opinion
to their opinion because I'm not going
to out legal opinion them for
sure so yeah uh so I I don't I don't
think I don't think the people on the
right are fully
appreciative of what Ben Shapiro brings
to the whole
conversation like you'll always have one
person whose logic and knowledge of the
event eventually maybe not on day one
one will be nearly
perfect so I I don't think we understand
how important that is that you've there
there are half a dozen people on the
right that have that kind of
intellectual weight and they can bring
it to almost any topic Elon Musk right
if I disagreed with Elon
Musk um for example Elon Musk says our
biggest problem in the world is
depopulation you know not reproducing
enough
I see a lot of people saying oh my God
he's so wrong our biggest problem is too
many
people to which I say do you hear
yourself if Elon Musk who has looked
into it a lot says with no reservation
whatsoever not not maybe not if biggest
problem is is our lack of reproducing
you should immediately pause your
opinion and say I need to find out more
about this because I prob
wrong
right you know uh I I'm not sure I was
totally on that
page until I heard how confident he was
and then I started looking at the data
and once you look at the data oh yeah
he's right he's definitely right if you
know a little bit about
economics you know they have a you have
to have a certain ratio of new people to
old people where everything
breaks although robots will
interesting
so all right ladies and
gentlemen there there wasn't much in the
way of news today so I just tried to
keep you company
and uh keep you
going yeah Japan in
particular uh is losing people like a
million a
year Mike Bert said the same thing Elon
did way back when this group was new you
you get the credit credit Mike
Bert
um someone says so big horn shaver says
would love to see Ben and Candice
Candace Owens knock down dragon fight
over Zionism versus the Catholic church
I wouldn't why would you want to see
that can't they have different
opinions see the thing is I'm not ask
asking you to have the same opinion as
as Ben Shapiro if you heard that you
heard it
wrong I ask you that you know if he's
talking about values or Israel you he
has a certain emotional connection to
things you don't have to take those
opinions because because those I think
he would be you know quite transparent
and saying where his even where his
biases are I think he'd be completely
transparent about that he always is
right
all right
um you love to listen to me rapping
while you're rapping you're rapping on
Christmas day I guess your family's
coming later
huh
um 's a performer not a deep
intellectual all right so let me comment
this so somebody's commenting that Ben
spu is a performer not a deep
intellectually honest
thinker now in order for you to have
that opinion you would have to be
smarter than Ben
Shapiro because if you didn't recognize
what he's doing as
intellectually deep depending on the
topic uh how could you judge that can
your dog judge your your
intelligence no can you judge your dog's
intelligence
probably so in general the smartest
person can judge the intelligence of the
less intelligent person but not vice
versa so if you think that he's a
performer and not an honest
intellectually intellectual thinker that
kind of puts you that your opinion is
that you're smarter than he is is that
what you're saying
I I like I say I'm an egomaniac and even
I don't say that he's clearly smarter
than I am clearly like if we if we took
any kind of standardized test or a
history test a math test he would beat
me on probably every
parameter so I don't
judge that he's not a deep thinker I
judge that I can't tell it's deeper than
I can go if it's deeper than I can go
then I'm getting a lot of value out of
it so yeah I I think some of the uh
criticisms are
overblown he wouldn't beat me a tennis
maybe he does have
youth he has a Harvard Law degre
um but he is a
performer so one of the things I that
seems to be um directed as an
insult that doesn't come across as an
insult is that somebody is just doing
something for
clicks that's literally the business
model the business model of everybody
who talks about politics is quote doing
things for clicks
it's not an
insult it just means that they're doing
more than one thing at a time that they
can do things for clicks while making
the world a better
place um I do things for
clicks but I try to make sure that
people are getting value from it so I'll
get your click you get some value if you
like the entertainment or you learn
something and then we're both
happy you got some entertainment I get a
click why is that a problem
why is that a problem to to me those
kinds of um complaints seem like you're
not in a winning
mindset a a winner mindset is oh you're
doing something good and you're getting
paid and people are all happy about that
good for you that that should be the
approach so so if somebody's an
Entertainer in addition to being able to
think deeply isn't that just a talent
stack Trump's an Entertainer but clearly
he can go
deeper that's a talent stack so
sometimes your insults are just
compliments and I don't know what to do
with
it or or when you say when people uh
mock me for changing my
mind that's a compliment that I changed
my mind if you're trying to make that
seem like an insult to embarrass me that
that's not going to
work every time anybody changes their
mind you've seen me a million times say
oh it looks like Jen or Bill Mah or
somebody or you know coming closer to an
opinion that I hold I always compliment
them I don't insult them for their old
opinions so yes we're going to work for
clicks we're going to be entertaining if
we can and we're we're going to try to
make as much money as we can but you're
never going to succeed unless the
audience is getting a lot out of
it how's that a
crime uh with the solution to the
economic problem be more babies
well if we knew how to do
that um the assumption is that there's
something we could do in the United
States to to improve the number of uh
American born
babies I don't know if there is there
there's nothing I've heard that could
get that job
done the probably in the long run if you
improved your economic
situation um or the way we raise kids or
the way schools work or something you
you could easily imagine that if we
changed enough we can get back to having
more kids but I don't see it happening
I think the the structure of the United
States and how much it costs to
live uh is just so expensive that people
say yeah I can do one baby at most I
don't think that's going to change
unless the economy changes radically I
don't see it radically
changing maybe all right here's what
here's one way it could
change suppose robots start doing all
the work
and people have too much free
time and let's say that all the basics
are provided by robots so that nobody's
on of food nobody's going to run out of
diapers nobody's going to run out of
Health Care so basically all the basics
are be taken care of and you're
bored if you were bored because you
didn't need to work and it didn't cost
you extra to have a
baby well maybe that's exactly what
would cause you to have more babies but
you know what the problem would be by
the time your robots are handling all
that stuff you're not going to need more
babies so but by the time the robots are
really doing the work of people and in
at a large scale we're going to start
talking about having too many people
again
because they won't have a
purpose so if people stop having a
purpose because they don't work why
happens to
them can you imagine me with only
Leisure I don't think I could survive
that I I've I've evolved over a million
years like I'm I'm the result of a
million years of evolution that turned
me into a creature
that prefers work I prefer it I mean not
every kind of work
but I mean I'm working on on Christmas
Day because I want to be here I don't
have to be here there's nothing that
makes me be here I want to be here so I
don't know that I would love the world
where the robots are doing the podcasts
even if they're really good at
it so I still need a
person doing nothing is boring right
doing nothing that's useful to me is
torture if I do something that's hard or
easy or whatever
as long as I know it's really making a
difference for me or for somebody else
then I'm all in has to make a difference
but I don't really like the world where
the robots are working and I'm watching
TV you or or going to the gym I don't
know that that doesn't seem like the
world I want to live in I I worry that
the only way humans can survive and
thrive is if onethird of them are
starving
onethird of them are getting by and
onethird of them are thriving and really
trying to change the world and I think
if you change that to everybody's just
fine then it doesn't
work because the thing that propels
humans forward is the one-third that are
are going to really make things happen
onethird that are showing up and making
sure that things are clean and the
paperwork gets where it needs and then
onethird will always be below the level
the society needs for work there'll be
onethird of the world at least it's
probably beyond that already that
doesn't really have an
economic um value in terms of taking a
job so I think it has to be that way I
don't think we can all be in the
middle so that's what I worry
about when you listen to Ben SPO talk to
Russell Brand your head will explode
yeah
that's a lot of vocabulary between those
those
two you can tell Russell br's
intelligence by how quickly he can
compose perfect but complicated
sentences with big vocabulary but not so
big that you don't know what he's
talking about uh that's that's quite a
skill it would be like cats yeah just
laying around and licking
ourselves why won't Ben debate Nick fent
is that a serious
question
really are are you genuinely confused
about why Ben Shapiro would not debate
Nick
FES that can't be a real
question
no and by the way that I'm not insulting
Nick Fuentes
I'm just saying it wouldn't make any
sense for Ben to talk to
him it makes it would yeah I wouldn't
want to see that I wouldn't want to see
it at all and I wouldn't recommend you
do
it Santa looks like me without the beard
it's funny you should say that because I
was saying that while I was watching the
show I was joking about Santa being too
much like me
all right um I'm going to go talk to the
locals people
privately how about Matt Walsh what
about him you mean
to talk to Nick fenes how how
about how about um never ask me that
again I'm going to put on the list of
things I never want to answer or see a
question on is who should talk to Nick
fenes and I'm not insulting
Nick I'm just
saying I don't want to really even deal
with that question again cuz the problem
is he uh let me be more
specific Nick fent's
um his business
model is to involves creating
controversy that would rub off on
anybody who got near
him why do you think the people you like
should get near him
because you hate
them when does Christmas start it's
already
on we we we've got the Christmas trolls
in the
comments yeah I mean you you you can
love him or hate him but don't ask other
people to be part of his act his act
does not really
lend itself to
guests um now I'm talking as somebody
who got cancelled now trust me when I
say half of the country at least
half uh would have no interest in
dealing with
me I I had the experience recently of
asking and this is rare I don't ask
people to be guests on the show a lot
but there was uh one person in the
public domain I won't be specific who uh
I've chatted with a thousand
times maybe a thousand times so somebody
I know really well and somebody who at
one point had been big
fan um and I asked that person to come
on my show
because that person would be unusually
interesting and I got I got turned down
I got turned down
hard I got a hard turned down
but I I think the answer was uh if I'm
ever interested I'll let you
know what th this was somebody that like
I had quite an
extensive you know multi-year ongoing
conversation with and it was all
positive you know and uh but after I got
cancelled
nope nope now was wrong it was a was he
wrong I'm not going to tell you who it
was but if I did tell you who it was he
was probably right he was probably right
I would be a
reputational stain on his world and he
doesn't need that why why would he do
that so I I so I completely understand
if somebody doesn't want to go on Nick
Fuentes in exactly the same way I
understand if somebody doesn't want to
come on my show because I do present a
reputational
risk and that's just a fact it has
nothing to do with you know my character
or anything else I don't take it
personally so I didn't take it
personally when I got turned down by
somebody
who kind of surprised me but if you
looked at what their job is or or their
role let's say their role in the world I
won't call it the job but if you look at
their role in the world yeah yeah
keeping keeping the cancel guys stain
off of him probably a good probably a
good play he's got other fish to
fry all
right
um well we appreciate you all too
all right uh ladies and gentlemen look
at all that flannel that's a goodlooking
Dilbert doll I'm going to talk to the uh
locals people privately for a
moment and uh I'll see the rest of you
tomorrow thanks for joining me on this
special Christmas day you're all amazing
and thanks for thanks for the great year
