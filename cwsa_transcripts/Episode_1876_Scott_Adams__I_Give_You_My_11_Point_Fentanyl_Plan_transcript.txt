do
good morning everybody
well were you worried I wouldn't make it
on time come on
come on come on
who do you think you're talking to
yes always here and always on time
and how would you like to take this
special experience
that you have lucked into the best thing
that's ever happened to you probably
and take it up to an even higher level
yeah you would and all you need is that
cover of my girl glass and tanker
Chelsea style the canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that don't for being here today
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's happening now go on
oh
Excuse me while I enjoy a little
Afterglow
I need a cigarette I don't even smoke
that was one good sip did you all feel
it I felt that
feel it to my bones
well I'd like to uh thank Erica who has
put together a great mug
for coffee with Scott Adams and you'll
you'll see the final design pretty soon
and uh production and that will start
pretty soon so just a few weeks I think
you'll be able to get your own coffee
with Scott Adams mug I'm not going to
make any kind of profit off of that just
people wanted them so
so Erica was nice enough to organize
that
well there are protests in Iran there
was a I guess a young woman was
taken into custody for not wearing a
proper head scarf
and she died in custody which which
Nobody Knows the specifics of that but
it doesn't sound good
and so there are protests erupting
erupting all over Iran
um
now what do you think are the odds that
the protests that are erupting all over
Iran will topple the government
well it looks like
there's no chance for that
yeah nobody thinks there's any chance of
that in fact the Iranians are
sufficiently uh
they're sufficiently confident
that they actually let the protests
kind of Rage for a while they don't try
to stop it right away they actually let
people
get their energy out which isn't the
dumbest thing to do it's not the dumbest
thing to do but they're kind of watching
to see if it spreads
I feel like it won't
I don't know I don't I don't have a good
you know obviously I'm not keyed into
the mood of the average Iranian person
but I feel like it'll
be like one of these several other
flare-ups
and then it will just flare away
and as some experts said until you see
some kind of a leader on the other side
an opposition leader and there is none
right there's nobody to Rally around
until you see something like that in any
kind of a military defections
nothing's going to happen in Iran so and
there's nothing like that
so unlike the United States
unlike the United States in Iran if you
protest
nothing's going to happen
I mean you're not going to get anything
so weirdly it here's the weird thing is
that Iran is allowing more protests than
I thought they would allow
you know it's not it's probably not
legal
but they are kind of letting it run a
little bit I was surprised about that
um so aren't you glad
that you live in a country if you live
in America or you live in a some free
country somewhere else are you glad that
in your country
you know a big protest movement would be
successful
because we don't have military and stuff
like that to stop a protest and that's
why in the United States for example we
have this long string of successful
protests you remember Occupy Wall Street
well that changed everything
remember because before we'll Occupy
Wall Street
um there was this huge income inequality
and then the Occupy Wall Street came in
they they camped in their tents and
stuff until that gigantic gap between
the rich and the poor just shrunk
I mean that's
solved really
then let's not forget black lives matter
who had many valid
criticisms of the way the country was
being run especially in regards to
racial uh things and and most
particularly policing
now since black matter since black
matter since black lives matter
did their summer of protest
have you seen one major story of a
police department abusing a black person
none
none when was the last time you saw it
so I think you would have to conclude
that black lives matter completely
succeeded in eliminating
police violence against black citizens
completely done I haven't seen any have
you that's the most successful protest
anybody's ever done it eliminated
police brutality against black people
because if it were still happening we'd
see it in the news right
wouldn't you 'd be in the news I mean
that would be a giant story it always
was before
and so we don't hear about income
inequality that got solved racism
assault now this is something you can't
do in Iran
in Iran you'll just March around and
protest I'm protesting and then they'll
shoot you or put you in jail and nothing
will change
but in the United States we've already
eliminated income inequality
police brutality and then don't forget
about antifa
because antifa
had a series of complaints and they were
they were unhappy that the United States
was even a cohesive
operating entity
you know antifa is more like we just
want everything not to work
Ed sure enough
sure enough
just a few years after antifa was active
the entire country is disintegrating
exactly like antifa wanted
now
in Iran again
no no impact whatsoever protest protest
protest nothing they get nothing
that's because they are a totalitarian
country
in the United States we have freedom of
speech freedom of protest freedom to
organize and we get things done and
that's how we solved income inequality
police brutality against black people
and the cohesiveness of the United
States and I'm just getting started
what about those January 6 protesters
do you remember how they were worried
that the elections were perhaps not
transparent enough
well thankfully the Patriots got huge
changes both the Democrats and the
Republicans immediately
told you that the stuff that they run is
fine
so I was worried about it for a while
but the Republicans will tell you that
all the places that Republicans handle
the elections are just fine
and the Democrats will tell you every
place they do it it's all fixed
it's all good
so this might be one of the most
effective
probably one of the most effective
protests of all time
honestly let me ask you before January 6
didn't you have some questions I mean
just small ones maybe not big questions
at least small little concerns about the
Integrity of the election you probably
did you probably did but now after the
election's over and the January 6
protests have happened
what do you think now
well your media has told you that not
only have our elections been solid in
the past but they are so solid now
you don't have anything to worry about
so think about this
Iran all their protests no benefit at
all they got nothing out of it the
United States Occupy Wall Street solves
in the income inequality when was the
last time you saw a story about income
inequality
find me a headline about income
inequality assault done
no more problems
black lives matter they solved all black
all violence about police against black
people because we would see it I mean it
obviously would be in the news if any of
it were happening and antifa did
disintegrate the cohesiveness of the
United States as they wanted
perfect
and then January 6
according to the news we now have the
most secure elections
of all time of all time
and I I just want to give it up for the
protesters the United States who make
things happen
you you're the heroes you're the heroes
no you are you are you're the heroes
not me I mean you're the heroes
so keep up the good work
uh keep up that protesting because it's
making a difference
um
does anybody remember
in the beginning of the Ukraine war
when I said
I don't know everybody seems to think
Russia is just going to win this thing
kind easily
but it seems to me
somewhat obviously
not true
to me it seemed like they were going to
have a lot of trouble
and then maybe they wouldn't succeed at
all
do you remember
do you remember how much I got for
that
does anybody remember that I mean
something I remember but maybe you
didn't notice at all did anybody notice
and
today the news is pretty much a hundred
percent
exactly what I said am I wrong
the news today from all sources
is exactly what I said
that the technology of the ukrainians
made a big difference and especially
because they were fighting in their home
court
right and so what I was wondering is if
there are any of you because I know some
of you are quite brutal
if you'd like to take this opportunity
to say you were wrong and that I was
right
I'll wait
because I'm pretty sure 75 percent of
you thought I was wrong
now if you were right if you were right
and and I had been wrong let's say
Russia just took him over
I would tell you I was totally wrong
I would tell you I was totally wrong
because I did tell you I was totally
wrong
about Russia invading because I said
well no they're not going to fade
because obviously it wouldn't turn out
well
I was so wrong
so all of you who told me Scott it's
obvious that they're conveyed they've
got their entire military there it
couldn't be more obvious and I was still
saying no
no they're not going to evade so I will
tell you
I was completely wrong will you accept
that
will you accept I was a hundred percent
wrong when I said Russia won't invade
obviously obviously there's one
but I'd like you to tell me
that I got that one right
now here's the thing that always
that always comes back at me
whenever I make a prediction that
counters the experts which I've done how
many times have you seen me
how many times have you seen me make a
public prediction that's the opposite of
basically all the experts
and then been right
quite a few times and on in different
domains right political scientific now
military
that's a pretty wide swath now uh even
terrorism I think I've had some
some good guesses
um
and let me remind you
that my expertise is not knowing more
than experts
obviously I don't know more than experts
my expertise is spotting
which is a specific skill
and spotting is a higher level
skill than experts
you get that right
so every time everybody says Scott the
experts are up here and you're a lowly
cartoonist and you're down here so if
you're down here don't be criticizing
these people up here because they're up
here
that is a complete misunderstanding of
the situation
the experts are here
and everybody who has developed skill
at spotting
are up here
I'm not looking up at the experts I'm
looking down only in the case of the
 now if there's you know some
technical thing that they claim I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna be arguing them on
some small technical thing that's what
experts are for but if they make a a
large pronouncement about stuff
as soon as it's a large pronouncement
about anything
it's automatically political
right there's almost no such thing as a
pure scientific opinion that you know
matters to the public and the public
hears it it's always political by the
time it reaches the public by the way it
gets filtered and massaged so that's the
only thing I'm offering you
so at any time you see me criticizing
the experts
your first question should not be should
not be
who has more expertise because that's a
given I never claim more expertise I
only claim that you can spot if
you learn to do it and some of my books
I teach you how to do it now I do it
right in public I do it right in front
of you so you can see when it's right
and when it's wrong
all right
here's about uh the scariest thing I've
seen in a while and I've seen some scary
things let me tell you I've I've seen
some scary scary things but here's the
scariest one
and it's not going to scare you at all
because you won't understand it
and I'm sorry
and there's nothing and this is not an
insult to you but it really is not
would you accept would you accept the
general statement
that if you were let's say well versed
in a topic you would have a different
take on it than somebody who didn't know
much about the topic
you give me that right
that you know an expert's opinion is
going to be different than somebody
else's
all right I always talk about this
account which you should be following
Machiavelli's underbelly who does a lot
of AI demonstrations so you're seeing
all kinds of demonstrations of what you
can ask the AI to do
from artwork to creating talking
artificial figures to writing poetry
making comics and just seeing where the
AI is at and it's that's there
so
somebody says Andrew Tate was right
about me
edutate literally copies my opinions and
then pretends I have opposite ones so he
can mock me
you know that right he actually just
imitates me the the Andrew taint story
is actually he is a disciple so he was a
fan of mine and I and I basically mocked
him in public and then he got hurt so
now he's he's acting up but basically
he's he's somebody who imitates me
tries to put his own spin on it and
create his own little thing
but he is a
he's a humorous character anyway
uh here's what the latest AI came and
this is the scariest thing I've seen so
far it was a a deep fake looking
character not a deep fake because it was
just a animated head
so as a person who looked pretty much
like a person
um who was giving a hypnosis
monologue in other words it was somebody
who was a artificial entity using AI to
hypnotize you the viewer but knowingly I
mean you would know you were being
hypnotized because it's overt
and here's something that you would not
be able to appreciate it like if you if
you're sort of in the hobby or
professional realm of influence you've
spent a lot of time hypnotizing or being
hypnotized or feeling influenced or
judging it you have you have sort of
almost
almost like a musician would have a
musical sense they develop there's
somebody who just likes music would
never develop you know what I mean
when I watch this AI I can feel
the persuasion
I can feel it it's actually visceral
in this instant
oh my God
oh my I didn't even know what to say
about it I went to tweet about it and I
didn't even have a comment like I didn't
know what to say I just OMG
because
if you pair me
with an AI and say Scott can you train
this thing
I'd say yeah I probably could and start
giving it rules and say try this try
this try this now if the only thing it
did was present it didn't interact
there's a limit to how to how powerful
it could be
because it would have to give a generic
presentation to people who are all
different
so there's no generic presentation
that's going to work the same for all
different people
what makes hypnosis one-on-one powerful
is the hypnotist is observing the
reaction and then adjusting in real time
it's that part that makes it really
powerful
we're at the point where the technology
could very easily
read my face as a viewer
and determine if the things the AI is
saying are working or not
and it could do it better than I could
do it and they could probably do it
fairly quickly better than I can do it
on day one I could do it better than a
machine
on day two I could still do it better
than AI day three day four I'm still
better than AI
but somewhere around a month of training
the AI it's going to be way better than
people
so it will be the most
capable Persuader by far and for sure
so AI will be the most persuasive
asset resource entity I don't know what
to call it
the most persuasive entity
and it won't be it won't be like beating
humans by 10 and the here's the part
you're never going to believe
all right there's nothing I can tell you
that will make you understand how
powerful this is nothing I can tell you
you just you have to have lived it felt
it you know breathed it to really
understand this
this is so powerful
I had to turn it off
like I watched it for a while and I it
was just taking over my body I mean I
could just feel it and I was like I'm
out of here and that was just a test
right that was before somebody like me
tried to train it
imagine
somebody who like was actually the Deep
a deep expert trained this thing to be
manipulative
I
because the other thing you can do is
presumably you could change the face
it's presenting
I'm pretty sure
that some faces are more persuasive to
some people
now it could be you know just obvious
stuff maybe a sexy woman is more
persuasive to most or some people
maybe uh an older male with a deep voice
would be more persuasive to just some
people not everybody maybe a gay voice
that you're going to argue with me
whether this gay voice right
are we going to do that
[Laughter]
I once had a conversation with somebody
who is very angry at me for being a
racist
for suggesting that you can usually
identify a black person's voice on the
phone
now I'll acknowledge that you could be
wrong quite often it's pretty common you
we've heard lots of singers for example
that sound like they're black singers
because they're you know they're trying
to they're trying to pretend I guess
um so you can certainly be fooled
there's not any kind of 100 thing but
anybody who tells me that you can't
generally tell
you're not a serious person and the same
with gay voice of course there are gay
people who don't have
identifiable gay voices of course plenty
of them
I could name I could name five right now
but
am I wrong that usually you can identify
if somebody's out and you know they're
they're they're not trying yeah that
Dave rubin's a perfect example who you
wouldn't be able to identify him by
voice
but there are plenty of people you could
nobody doubts that right
and I've always wondered about that have
you
have you ever wondered how much of that
is just social
how much is biological
has anybody ever looked into that
because I've always wondered that I
assume it's biological right but maybe
some of it is
affectation
I don't know
because I doesn't seem like some people
could turn it on and off depending on
whether they're at work
whether they're at work or you know
private setting I always wondered about
that it's just curiosity doesn't have
any it doesn't have any importance to
anything but watch out for those uh
persuasive AIS
uh here's something that the Republicans
are doing all wrong
they're demanding an investigation into
reyeps
why is that all wrong anybody anybody
why is it wrong to demand that we knew
more about reyups
it's wrong because they already gave us
the answer
they said they're not going to give us
any more information
that's all you need
if you go to somebody and say did you
steal my pen and they say
I'm not going to answer that I'm not
going to take that question
does that mean they didn't steal your
pen
well maybe
it's not confirmation at all is it if
somebody said did you steal my pen and
the person says I'm not going to tell
you that is not confirmation is it
but
would it make sense for you as a normal
thinking human in the United States or
any other country
would it be reasonable for you to say in
that situation well my working
assumption is that you have my pen
don't know for sure
but I'm gonna go and live my life as if
that were true because that's that's the
only working assumption that makes sense
Ray apps
is a working assumption
I don't know if he was a Fed
and I will not make that claim
because I don't know the reason I don't
don't know is that the FBI won't tell me
now under those circumstances given the
credibility being low for the FBI given
that they've been asked directly by
members of Congress for whom they they
should answer
and given that they said directly we're
not going to tell you about it
you don't need to ask any more questions
you don't need to ask any more questions
you can simply act on that assumption
and you should tell people that complain
about it go it's really not my problem
here here's what we do we do meaning
people do here's a common mistake that
people make
they assume that somebody else's problem
is their problem
Ray Epps is the FBI's problem
period
it's not a republican problem
Republicans just say you know we have to
we have to operate on this assumption
we're we're forced to operate on the
Assumption so we'll go forward based on
the assumption that it was an FBI
operation
no no research needed
am I wrong
the the problem is the FBI is to solve
we should conclude at least Republicans
everybody else should too but at least
Republicans just say it has been
demonstrated to our satisfaction
that the the most reasonable working
assumption given that we can't have all
the information the most reasonable
working assumption is that he works for
the FBI so that's how we will make
policy we will proceed on that basis
we'll communicate on that basis and
we'll act on that basis in every while
because that's the only thing we have
it's all we have if the FBI wanted to
solve their problem
their problem is a credibility problem
it's not your problem
stop making their problem your problem
just declare it's over
the ray up situation is over we know
everything we need to know
if we're wrong we're wrong
and they they have every every
opportunity to correct us
but don't make their problem your
problem just act as though you already
have the information because you do you
have everything you need
you don't need anything else
to know that you can't trust what
happened on January 6. and therefore you
can pardon every person associated with
January 6 except for the violent ones
because
the operating assumption
is that the FBI
was the was at least one part of the
incitement
I'll bet not one person disagrees with
that right
and until you hear that it wasn't your
problem you didn't I bet you didn't
realize that before did you
you just sort of kind of get in the mode
and you go well this is our problem we
have to solve this we have to have the
information no you don't
you don't need anything you have
everything you need
this is settled
it's settled it's like did Hillary
Clinton try to overthrow the government
effectively with the Russia collusion
stuff
that is settled it's a yes there's no
question about it
we keep acting like these are open
questions
and they might be unknown
but they're not open questions
because the the question asking period
is just has no value anymore because
nobody's going to answer your question
you have to go forward based on what is
the working assumption because that's
what you do with everything
yeah if you walk outside you don't know
that your car's still there
but you still walk out
with the intention of getting in it
everything you do is with the intention
with the understanding that you don't
know for sure
what's true you just have to have
operating assumptions all the time
that's it and every time somebody says
well do you think it's true or what is
your proof that Ray Epstein anything you
say oh I don't have any proof
don't have any proof now is it operating
assumption that the FBI has has given us
they've just provided us that operating
assumption
and then just go on I wouldn't even I
wouldn't even give it
the slightest attention to if it's true
because if it's true has now completely
become irrelevant
because nobody will tell you right if
nobody's going to tell you if it's true
and that's obviously the case if
nobody's going to tell you it's true
then the truth doesn't matter to the
decisions
does that make sense
if you know you'll never know the truth
then the truth isn't relevant to your
decision making
because you have to just make an
operating assumption
yeah
all right
um I came up with a 10 point but then I
added a point based on comments so now
it's an 11 Point fentanyl policy
proposal why did I come up with a
fentanyl policy proposal well nobody
else was doing it
no seriously I mean I think some people
have said oh I think we'll do border
security
okay that's not serious that is not the
serious let me tell you what a serious
fentanyl Planet would look like now I
want to be very clear
I have no reason to believe these are
good ideas
this is a first draft it's brainstorming
I'm creating I'm creating a framework
that people can react to
have you ever noticed it's easier to
react to an idea than to come up with
one
by the way this is a really
persuasive trick
the person who writes it down first
usually owns the debate
so that's what I did I just thought I
kept looking for somebody to have a plan
that I could back I was like oh somebody
must have a good plan once I find that
good plan I'll promote that I'll back
that nope nope no plan so I just wrote
down the plan
and tweeted it do you know what that
does that puts me in charge
I just took charge of it
you think that's not true but it just
happened I just took over
and it's because it was a there was a
vacuum
there was a vacuum
and I just walked into it now I don't
want to be here
but it was open if you're going to leave
the door open
don't blame me for walking through
so I walked through and I gave you an 11
point plan and from this point on
you're going to have to make a better
plan or you're going to have to react to
mine and even if you made a better plan
you're probably reacting to mine so at
this point I'm going to make other
people react to me so I'm in charge
right
you see how this works right and by the
way this works in your business and in
your personal life just as well the
first person who writes it down and like
an easy to look at form and it has to be
easy to look at
I looked at Kerry Lake's proposals for
you know she's running for
um governor in Arizona and her proposal
was a very Tech space and probably well
written in in terms of you know good
sentence structure and stuff like that
and there was lots of it it's like page
and page and page and just some of it
was about fentanyl but it was part of
border security and blah blah blah and
that's not it that's not what we're
looking for what we're looking for is
build the wall
simplicity
if it's not as easy as build the wall
people aren't going to do anything about
it you need to get simpler so
I give you now my 11 point plan uh
you'll be and let me tell you the 11th
one that's added because otherwise you
won't be able to concentrate so I'm
going to tell you the one I added based
on comments which I agree with which is
we should test
legalizing alternative opioids locally
just to see if that does make a
difference you know just pick a zip code
and say all right and this ZIP code you
can do all the heroin and cocaine you
want
it's all legal you just no fentanyl
um I guess
you know they some of them might still
get fentanyl but you would test to see
if it made any difference at all okay
so I want you to know that that's added
to the plan but it's last so now you
know it's there so you don't have to
obsess about it all right number one
these are my suggestions and I don't
know if they're good don't know if
they're good it's a starting point
number one remove prescription
requirements for Narcan that's a drug
you administered to tell you as a
fentanyl overdose
um and in some places you need a
prescription
and I think in some places you don't and
I believe Florida you don't
um but that's not good enough it's not
good enough that it's just available
it's not good enough
you also need some kind of organized
method maybe an app maybe the next door
app maybe something like that where if
you volunteer that you have some in your
home for emergencies
that somebody can send out an alert in
your block and say oh there's an
overdose happening right here at this
address and then your alert would go off
and you're like oh I've got some
Narcan in my closet you grab it you run
out the door it's literally your
neighbor
literally your neighbor
you're out the door in 30 seconds and by
the way that's probably true
you get an alert boom Narcan overdose
you look at the address and it's two
doors down
30 seconds out the door right
what would stop you
you'd be grabbing it on a run and you'd
be out your door in 30 seconds in 40
seconds in 40 seconds you'd be on site
40 seconds just you know on average and
if you do have to do the Nar then okay
and I guess there's also a question
about some kind of a device there's a
what's the name of it there's a certain
device that used to come with it or does
come with it that makes it easier to
administer
I think you can still administer it as a
spray up the nose
so I have a little I have some questions
about is physical form and how to
administer it uh but I think in which
goes to another point there should be a
national education program on how to use
it all right that's Point number one get
Narcan available and also organize
through apps so it's really really
available like within seconds we could
do that number two create a military
unit specifically for destroying the
cartels in Mexico do they have to be
deployed no
no they don't have to be deployed
but if we don't create one the cartels
are never going to take us seriously
we need a dedicated big badass military
unit for Invasion and and occupation of
Mexico not the whole country just you
know the Narco centers
um maybe just one
and
all right so that's number two create a
special military unit for attacking the
cartels number three
give the cartels a six-month deadline to
stop all fentanyl operations
but not necessarily everything else
fentanyl only
they could still do illegal stuff we
don't want them to we're not saying it's
okay to
we're just saying this is our red line
right this is just the red line you have
to know cartels they're selling us the
other stuff
is very very bad and we're going to try
to stop you in normal ways we'll use
sort of normal ways to try to stop all
the other stuff but fentanyl we're not
going to be normal
fentanyl's War it's not drugs we'll
treat the drugs in the normal way what
you're used to
but fentanyl we're going to treat it as
a war and you are our enemy if you want
that model going forward just keep
selling fentanyl for six more months now
the reason you give them six months is
that it takes a long time to unwind
anything
they need to think about it they need to
you know they need to really maybe even
get some Alternatives right it's just
not going to be fast
and that six months happens to be
ideally six months from the time a new
president is installed so I'm thinking
maybe summer of 2024
we should tell the cartels we've we've
spun up a military unit
and if on the end of June we see one
pill the fentanyl across this border
we're going to launch an invasion
and it's not going to be you know just
to do a mild
kind of a you know punch you and hurt
you it's to take over
the the United States military should
take over the cartels operation just
like conquering a country
you should take over as the head of the
operation and just rub the thing and
turn it into something else
just be the the batter boss
um
all right I would say open number four
open a direct negotiation with the
cartel leaders
president to cartel leader now would
Biden do that of course not would he be
capable of course not
could Trump do that
could Trump
talk directly maybe not directly
directly but through an intermediary
could Trump negotiate with the head of
the cartel
yep
in fact name one person on the planet
Earth who would be more ideal for that
job
you can't
you can't you'll be the number one best
person in the planet Earth to negotiate
directly with a cartel leader nobody
else could do that not as well
um
then I think we also if we're going to
negotiate we're going to have to give
the cartels a retirement plan
so either the retirement plan is you
just go back to doing your other illegal
things and we'll just go back to our cat
and mouse game
or
you need some Financial guarantees and I
don't know
some kind of legal guarantees but you've
got to get out of the business and
you've got to close it down so nobody
just takes it over
I mean one of the things you could do
for example is hire the one of the
cartels to become this the Fighting
Force to beat the other cartel
I mean you could probably just hire them
as you know if cartels can hire people
to be murderers quite easily apparently
we should be able to bribe some people
to go murder the murders
doesn't seem like that would be
expensive
um
number five declare fentanyl a weapon of
mass destruction and the cartel's
terrorist organizations you're already
seeing some calls for that but that
would open up military options of course
and it also signaled our intentions it's
very important to Signal our intentions
because the cartels have to do what we
want them to do or nothing happens
so you've got to Signal very carefully
okay you know that drug war you thought
you were in well that's not this
the drug war is the other stuff This is
war war
so we're going to distinguish between
drug war and war war This is war war
this is the kind that gets wet
um
number six Titan border security of
course
but understanding that it won't make
much difference
the understanding that it won't make
much difference is key because otherwise
the our politicians who are worthless or
worthless we'll just talk about border
security because it's fun to talk about
and they understand it a little bit
if you let them talk about border
security is all they'll talk about
and that's a trump problem right Trump
made border security like the the
tastiest thing to talk about
so they're they're only going to be like
the shiny object border security border
security you've got to make sure they
know that's five percent of the problem
because you know you could hold in your
hand enough fentanyl to take out a whole
city
it's like a baseball
it's over the wall
it is not hard to get fentanyl across
the border the fact that people have
been caught in Fairly large numbers
tells you nothing about how hard it is
to get it across nothing
fentanyl is so let me do the math for
you
let's say a hundred percent of the
fentanyl that gets shipped gets to the
Border
that's bad right
now let's say you uh find a way to catch
90 of what comes through
90 what does that do
to the usage on the receiving end
nothing nothing not at all and it's not
because the 10 percent that gets through
is enough
do you know why
because I'm saying it does actually cut
it by
let me let me say it um in a more
specific way because I'm thinking I'm
misleading you let's say you you catch
90 of everything that goes across the
border
would that reduce
fentanyl usage in the United States it
would not do you know why
somebody tell me why catching 90 percent
of it wouldn't reduce the the use at all
why
is a math reason kind of it's a business
reason really
hike the price now
oh okay thank you thank you somebody
somebody came up with the right answer
the answer is they will make ten times
more
that's all they have to do they'll just
make 10 times more and then the then the
10 that gets through is now their
original number
there's nothing you could do at the
border they'll just make more now that
would not be true of marijuana do you
know why
because marijuana is bulky
and it's it's hard to like go make
another crop in 10 minutes right you
have to wait months for another crop
fentanyl you could just go back to the
lab like that
well there's another batch
right so every time you make any analogy
to drug wars they're all wrong all the
analogies to a drug war don't just don't
apply to the Fentanyl
right
all right so border security yes but
don't think that's a solution uh do a
master number seven do a massive public
education campaign on Fentanyl and
Narcan a lot of people think they
understand it but I see a lot of really
basic misunderstandings
out there
number eight give China a deadline to
stop fentanyl shipments or the
alternative is we do it for them
whatever it takes
and this should not be a point of
negotiation
we should simply tell them the date
Beyond which
all the all the controls are off on our
side
and just say we're taking all the
controls off now what's the first thing
you might worry about
they might nuke us right
now like suppose we started killing
people in China which is exactly what
I'm suggesting killing people in China
right what if they nuke us
yeah War right
totally worth the risk
let me say it again
yes War yes
yes
unambiguously War
that's my choice
unambiguously yep
if you want to go to war over the
question of you're already killing a
hundred thousand Americans amen
I'm in sign me up
if China wants a war over this give him
a War
a full War a real war
destroy half of the world because you
know what you can't do you can't let
people kill a hundred thousand of you a
year and not respond to it
that
is not an option
our current situation is not an option
do you ever have somebody in your life
who threatened to kill themselves if you
didn't give them what they wanted which
was unreasonable has anybody ever had
that
anybody close to you ever say I will
kill myself
now watch the yeses go by I will kill
myself if you don't give me what I want
and what was your response
if your response was giving them what
they wanted
how'd that work out
I feel like in at least two occasions
I've been threatened that way and not
only did I say go ahead
I meant it
right so let me let me give you a bottom
line in my life if somebody comes to me
and I don't care who
doesn't matter what kind of loved one it
is family member or spouse it doesn't
matter
you come to me and you say you're going
to kill yourself if I don't do something
that really is a bad thing to do
 kill yourself
I'll give you the gun
because I'm not going to live one minute
under those conditions not one minute
so if killing yourself is the
alternative go kill yourself
by the way I've said that twice they
both tried
they both tried twice
um both a lot you know didn't work both
times
um and if if either of them had been
successful I would have been fine with
it
I never would have a moment of guilt not
a moment
because there's no way I'm going to live
under somebody else taking control of my
body and my life
by by telling me that they're going to
hurt themselves if I'm not their slave
I'm not going to be your slave
no I'm not going to be China slave
so if people have to die to make me not
China's slave that's what war is for
that's the whole point of War
to make me not somebody else a Slave
all right
so here's the thing China has to know
that you're serious about this and not
bluffing and there's only one way to
make them know you're serious about it
and not bluffing which is actually do it
we should actually just start killing
some people in their country I don't
know how hard that is I feel like there
must be some way to get a murderer into
China or send a drone in there or
something mail them some poison send
them something in the mail send them a
pipe bomb there must be some way to kill
people in China
but we should go ahead and start killing
them
um
let's see
um and then number nine when the
deadline passes because China would
ignore us of course I don't make any
I I have no uh dreams that they would
act in any way so of course China will
ignore our requests so we should start
killing other people the dealers only uh
but then when the deadline passes this
is number done send our send our
diplomats home and theirs too
fentanyl needs to be a single topic
issue they shouldn't be negotiated as
part of the package with anything else
we should just say look
fentanyl's a red line
we're taking our diplomats home and
we're sending here some we we're not
even going to be a country talking to
you if you can solve this
and then we should expel one Chinese uh
student meaning somebody who's an actual
Chinese resident uh one Chinese student
in American colleges for every fentanyl
death just dooman alphabetical order
and just just make it a formula and say
we don't even care we'll just
we'll just send them home because we
just don't care
so uh and then number 11 was do the
local test and I think you have to test
it locally the idea of legalizing other
drugs so there are fentanyl Alternatives
you'd have to do that locally because
there's no way that the country is going
to say let's do it the whole country
you agree
there's no way we get the whole country
to say oh let's make cocaine legal
that's not going to happen but you can
make a zip code you could find a blue
state it doesn't have to be could be a
red State and by the way I think the red
States should test it
um and just test it
but you you probably have to make it
I don't know would you have to make it
non-porous
I suppose some fentanyl would still get
in but if you see you'd have to make it
free or something I don't know how you
would design it but let's just say that
that feels doable like you probably
could design something to test
somebody says that I'm I I'm suggesting
that the CIA should fight the CIA is
that because you think fentanyl is a CIA
plot
is that what you think
I don't think so
all right
uh rapid test kits to screen for
Fentanyl
maybe
um
Maybe
so the rapid test kits I've heard that
there are some like practical
limitations to that like it sounds like
a good idea but the addicts won't
actually use them
you know at least at a high enough level
that make a difference but test it
test it right you could do the same
thing with your uh with the ZIP code
just pick a zip code and say we're going
to have all kinds of fentanyl testing
stuff here all you want is free see if
it makes a difference
there's no criminal penalty for having
drugs in Oregon
um which suggests which suggests
we should test Oregon to see if they
have a higher OD level
per addict here you don't do the OD
level in general
you would say of addicts what presented
them OD'd and I would be interested if
Portland has legalized drugs
but what I think probably happens in
Portland is they simply legalized
Fentanyl
accidentally because if you buy a pill
you don't know what's in it
there's nothing in Oregon that would
make their pills suddenly become pure
cocaine or Pure Hair out when when they
had always been
partly fentanyl well how would
legalization change the mix of drugs
that they're buying
unless you unless you gave those
Portland people free heroin
they're still going to buy whatever's on
the street and what's on the street is
Fentanyl so how does the legalization
help
because that doesn't change the supply
so it has to be more than legal has to
be free right
the Alternatives would literally have to
be free otherwise they just go in the
streets and they buy and they don't know
what they get just like now
the legalization would have no impact on
anything you just be buying the same mix
of good and bad all right
here's my uh well I think I had some
other topics here maybe
or did I
nope
is there anything else that happened
today
terrible idea
um
fentanyl is cheaper than heroin now I
would imagine yeah
because fentanyl
um
the precursors are easy to get right you
have to actually grow poppies to make
heroin
so I would assume that would be true
military coup on China is possible I
don't think so
oh yeah musk has been cleared to send
starlink to Iran how does that really
help Iran though
I don't know that starlink helps Iran it
makes sense in the in Ukraine
because they could put the star links
Behind Enemy Lines
uh and then turn them off after they've
used them so that they get some benefits
so that they're not targeted but if if
you had a starling base station in a
house in Iran
they would spot it immediately right and
just go turn it off
so I think I think the starlink is a
good idea I mean it's better than not
having it but I think it's something
that would make a big difference in
Ukraine
I don't know if they could hide them
well enough in Iran
um
it would help them it would help them a
little bit but I feel like they would
spot them because you can you can find
them electronically
oh yes I'm sorry thanks for reminding me
um so Matt Gates uh will not be charged
with any of those crimes that he had
been accused of did you hear that
Matt Gates is in the clear he's cleared
now
did I ever say that he would be cleared
does anybody remember did I make a
prediction about him
I did say to be cleared that I thought I
did yeah so that would be
that would be another prediction that I
think would be
non-obvious right
given given the uh you know the
excitement around his potential legal
problems
I feel like my pre my prediction was
sort of counter-intuitive
because it did sound like oh they got
the goods they're really going to go
after them but I never thought for a
moment that that was a risk I just
thought I thought it was a very bad
political situation that will dog him
forever but I never thought he was at
legal risk
yeah I predicted it would come to
nothing exactly
um
[Music]
oh so somebody's reminding me that what
I said was that every day that you that
you don't learn that there's something
bad really there
is less likely that you'll ever find it
it's like like the longer it goes the
less likely anything was real and I
think that became clear a few months ago
right
a few months ago it was already clear
that that wasn't gonna it wasn't gonna
turn into anything because you would
have known by then right
yeah remember we never heard an accuser
not nobody ever even surfaced the actual
woman
and I could I can't believe that the
young woman would actually
bring a you know be a good Witness
imagine if you were the woman involved
or if there was one right so allegedly
like who who would want to be part of
that
if they participated willingly who would
want to bring him down for that nobody
so I'm not even sure it matters in terms
of the legal process I don't I don't
think it matters what did or didn't
happen it wasn't it wasn't in the
domain of things that the public cares
about foreign
even the legal system doesn't care about
it it's so it's so trivial it is closer
to normal human behavior
than crime
and that's what I saw from the very
beginning it looked like normal human
behavior
didn't look like a crime to me
all right
uh
and it looks like
we have now completed possibly the best
show you've ever seen in your life
now how many of you are on board with
the fact that
um if we don't push on fentanyl
nothing's going to happen
and here's what I think I can do
I think by creating a some kind of thing
for people to react to that probably
moves the ball a little bit
but I'm also increasing the envelope of
what you can talk about in public
imagine imagine uh
a let's say a normie imagine a normal
politician saying the things that I just
said
can you imagine
just just imagine a routine normal
existing politician saying anything
close to what I just said in my 11 point
plan
nobody right nobody there's nobody who
has those balls
there is one candidate
who's close
his name is Trump
right and I'm going to be honest this is
purely this purely a balls question
like you'd have to have balls the size
of
you know beach balls to get this done
and he's the only one who does yeah he's
the only what he does I don't know why
I don't know why but he's the only one
who does
now you're you're mentioning some other
people but I guarantee you they're not
gonna they're not gonna be as strong on
this as I just was
now it also I've also created a problem
for Trump
do you realize that
do you know why
why does my plan create a problem for
Trump
because it's stronger than his is
nothing I think
right so he now he looks weak on uh
crime
I just made Trump look weak on crime you
know why because he's weak he's weak on
Fentanyl
I think he's strong on wanting to do
something about it but he's weak on
ideas so I'm trying to move the ball
forward so I'm trying to help him
as well as everybody else and by the way
if Biden said tomorrow I like your plan
I'm on team Biden and I'm going to ride
that horse
so I just want the problem solved I
don't really this is not a trump thing
don't care one way or the other
all right
um
and so ladies and gentlemen
this brings us to the conclusion of the
best live stream of all time
and if it wasn't the most entertaining
maybe it was the most useful because
I've told you before that this
thing we do this live stream it's like a
collaborative intelligence
meaning that you know I throw out ideas
or youth around ideas and we all react
to them and inform an opinion sort of
collectively
and I think this model is really
powerful and may be essential it might
be the model that is the the
counterbalance to some other forces that
are making politics not work at the
moment
all right
um
you don't declare war on Mexico when
running for president
Trump could
Trump could Trump could declare war on
Mexico while running for president
absolutely
yeah and here's what I approved with my
list this is the most valuable thing
that I proved
in fact I'm going to claim credit for
one thing
did you see
the low level of pushback to my my tweet
about the 11 points look at the comments
and look at people's pushback there are
of course critics right so there are
plenty of critics but the pushback is
really low
in fact it's less pushback than just
about anything I've said that's
provocative
yeah
yeah declaring that Mexico would pay for
the wall this that was more just
political stuff
right
uh another drug will not work it's been
tried I don't think all the variations
of that have been tried and
and the other thing that I would um
suggest is that people should not say
well this thing is better than this
thing
so we'll do this thing
you don't do that in a war
and a war you do both things
I've got one weapon against fentanyl
that doesn't look that strong but I've
got another weapon that looks pretty
strong so let's use the strong one and
don't use the weak one nope that is
wrong that is wrong you had two weapons
you use both of them use a strong one
you use the weak one use everything
everything test test weapon weapon right
we're not we're not playing around
anymore This Is War if you get a bullet
shoot it
all right that's all for now YouTube
I'll talk to you later tomorrow
