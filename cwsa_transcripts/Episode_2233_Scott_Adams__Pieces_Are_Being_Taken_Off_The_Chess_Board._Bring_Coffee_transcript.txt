you to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure there's never been a
fight or day in your life
but if you'd like to take those up to
the levels that nobody could possibly
imagine were possible
then all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chalices Diana canteen
Joker flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the parallel
pleasure the dopamine into the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous that happens now
go
Ah that's some good stuff
well it looks like the war is on
all the big chess pieces being taken off
the the board before the election we'll
talk about all that but uh
the most important story of the day is
that uh representative Lauren bobert
some call her boobert I don't know why
but uh she and her date
were ejected from a play because they
were getting well apparently they had a
number of uh offenses
uh she was allegedly vaping
which she says she doesn't remember
uh but it's on I guess on video so now
she remembers and
maybe she was singing and putting her
hands in the air and causing a
disturbance
but
of course we get to see the videotape of
her uh she and her date getting very
handsy with each other very handsy did I
mention very antsy
like really really handsy
but I don't think anybody noticed that
because they were kind of you know at
least a little bit discreet about that
did anybody have the same uh
same response I did when looking at the
video
I may have watched more than once
I may have said to myself
that looks like fun
I don't know I if somebody was trying to
make her look less appealing to voters
it didn't work on me
hahaha
all I thought to myself was
[Laughter]
she looks like fun
I have a single negative thought you
know the The Vaping and the making noise
during the during the show I didn't like
that but I don't even know if that
part's true
but no I don't care that you got hands
you with her date
uh
by the way she looks great for a
grandmother
I I'm old enough to remember that these
stories were never about grandmothers
before
she's a grandmother well there's another
grandmother in the story Christy gnome
so the the yeah the girls
all the news is about Gulfs today
if you don't know what a gulf is
well congratulations
if you don't know what a gilf is don't
ask and keep your innocence just
just say that you're in a perfect place
those of you who do know what a gilf is
well you've got some explaining to do
but those of you who don't know don't
look it up and don't ask that's all I'm
saying don't look it up don't ask you're
doing everything right just keep doing
what you're doing
don't change
all right
I can see on the locals platform there's
a lot of love for the gilfs
well the most important thing is that
somebody at Rice University figured out
how to make hydrogen from plastic waste
in some potentially economical way they
say
I feel like we're going to make fuel out
of everything
like somebody's going to make fuel out
of CO2 somebody else is making fuel from
plastic waste
I feel like we're going to find a way to
like
turn literally everything into either
fuel or 3D printing
is there any reason we can't take all
this waste plastic and turn it into 3D
printing just like shove it in your 3D
printer and have it you know melt it and
reuse it
I feel like that's the obvious thing to
use to do
well it's all different kinds of plastic
so it's probably hard
well uh
so not to be outdone uh
so President Biden
decided he was gonna
borrow a play from Trump and he was
going to come up with an insulting
nickname for Trump that would really be
like ah you know like the kill shot I
really take him down
because he's seen Trump do it you know
Trump has taken out opponents with just
one good nickname
takes him right off the board yeah
um
so Biden wanted to do that and he came
up with a nickname for Trump
he's going to call him uh Donald Hoover
Trump
Donald Hoover Trump
um
I don't like to usually give advice
to Joe Biden but I'm going to make an
exception
if you're trying to win the youth vote
some would call it the tick tock vote
uh Hoover references
so close it's a near Miss it's a near
Miss
but you didn't quite hit the demographic
you were going for there
uh
what percentage of the American public
even knows Hoover was once a president
much much less that there was job loss
during Hoover's Administration five
percent
five percent of the country even knows
that Hoover was once a president
and you know that there was job loss
and
of course is a ridiculous comparison
because uh the job loss under Trump was
pandemic related and the job growth
under Biden was the end of the pandemic
related
so
I mean it's just so so thoroughly
it's not even corrupt
it's like Biden is making the stupidest
argument that he did a good job on jobs
it's the stupidest argument anybody ever
made
oh well he lost jobs during the pandemic
yeah and after the pandemics and jobs
came back
oh yeah
that's the best he has
think about the fact that the Democrats
have to live with the concept
that Biden is their best champion
do you ever watch that movie Troy
I think it was called Troy
where uh
Brad Pitt plays this you know great
warrior guy and he has to fight the
other great warrior from the other team
and you know he goes out Achilles
was he Achilles yeah he played Achilles
so he was their best warrior so in one
scene he plays the best warrior from the
other side and you know one-on-one he
beats him
I feel like the Democrats did not watch
that movie
because you're supposed to pick your
best warrior
you pick your Brad Pitt
you send your Brad Pitt into battle see
then you have a chance
you don't want to pick
your most infirmed
brain dead guy
send him into battle
but that's what they're doing they
literally picked the worst guy in the
entire Democratic Party
the worst one the biggest liar
the least smart one and the most
dishonest I don't think they could have
done a better job of picking a worse
person
well fetterman but fetterman is actually
smart when his brain is working
that's sort of different
um
all right
so uh as you know
uh
president Trump said that on Friday he
said he would appoint a task force
to review the cases of people he says
were unjustly prosecuted by the
weaponized Biden Administration
so he says that many he wins the
election he's going to appoint a special
task force to rapidly review the cases
of every
political prisoner
who's been unjustly prosecuted by the
Biden Administration
and he's going to sign their Pardons and
commutations on day one
well is that kind of perfect
so do you see him making you think past
the sale
so the sale is hey is Biden using the
the government as a a political weapon
so that's the question is he doing that
and and Trump is making you think all
the way past that
to setting up the committee to fix it
and to to address the injustices of the
weaponized government
that's perfect
that is perfect
persuasion
it's just perfect there's not there's
not a single thing you can say is wrong
with that that is perfect do you know
it's not perfect
Donald Hoover
Trump
yeah not perfect that's lesson perfect
yeah but the commission to overturn all
the weaponized prosecutions that's
perfect
that is perfect
all right what else is going on
um
have you heard that uh
Christie gnome is
accused of having a long-term affair
with Corey Lewandowski
famous Trump advisor
now
yeah yeah that's the big news today
that's that's the big news
um so here's a question
is this a twofer
is there somebody who wanted both of
these people taken off the board
because Christy gnome was one of the
people who was often spoken of as a VP
pick and part of the uh for Trump and
the apparel the story says that Corey
who was allegedly having an affair with
her
um that he was pushing Trump to nominate
her as vice president
now
I'm going to say Corey Lewandowski
I'm a little bit impressed
I'm a little bit impressed
Corey Lewandowski created a situation
where he was very close
to being able to the president of
the United States
and
I all I got to say is
I mean let me connect the dots if Corey
Lewandowski had succeeded in convincing
Trump to pick Christy gnome who it turns
out they had some relationship with
if she had waited the four years of
Trump's presidency and then let's say
did a good job and became the obvious
choice to run for the office next
he could actually have a he could
actually be married to the president
and would presumably have a lot of
influence over her opinions as couples
do
so Corey Lewandowski actually had a play
to run the country
like it was actually he was kind of this
close to Taking Over America
with his penis
with his penis
one man almost conquered the United
States with a penis
and I'm not even joking
that actually happened
now it looks like it's not going to
happen but that is a hell of a try Corey
Lewandowski
I've never seen a penis used in a way
more effectively have you now look at
the way let's just compare let's just
compare
um the the data that Lauren bobert
brought to the play
his his penis was involved in that story
I guess she was allegedly groping his
penis now that was a
that's a poor use of a penis
you following me yeah that's a poor
years now it was fun at the time but
there's no long-term benefit to that
penis use
now some people will use their penis to
have children
that's a good use that's nice long-term
planning
but Corey Lewandowski was using his
to run the to almost Run America
you know through his wife if she had
been elected if they'd got married if
she became president
so I'm just impressed the best use of a
penis
in in a long time
I don't care if Christie known had an
affair
and that
that you know I'm at the point where I
just assume everybody is
I just assume everybody is
yeah if you see somebody who looks uh
sensationally attractive and they've
been married for 30 years and they're
also out there all the time you know
they're traveling and they're seeing the
world it's a lot to expect that they're
not having an affair
in the real world it's almost a
guarantee
so
well thank goodness this is the only two
stories in the news about people acting
according to other people sexually and
appropriately
oh except there's a story about Russell
Brand Russell Brand is in the news
um
but if I said enough about Christy gnome
and Corey Lewandowski there is a
political implication to this who's next
in line as a VP for Trump if Christy
gnome is off the list go you tell me who
would be next on the list
yeah
I'm seeing Kerry Lake I'm seeing Vivek
who says he's not running for VP I'm
seeing Tim Scott I'm seeing uh Sanders
are no won't be RFK Jr
all right so here's my take
it won't be Carrie Lake
because she's Carrie Lake
I don't think she's strong enough
I don't I don't think she gives Trump
enough
Kerry Lake would look like a
politically correct pick
Carrie Lake would look like she was
because she was a woman and she would
she was not a winner
she's not a winner
so if she had won an election
and then did a good job
she might be a candidate but at the
moment she's kind of somebody who lost
and I don't think she's exactly the
personality that Trump needs
yeah she's not exactly the right
personality because she's kind of
she's got a tough personality that I
think would be great for running for
president
if he asked me would she make a good
president Maybe
she has a very leadership he you know
kind of vibe to her but as a vice
president to someone who's also a strong
personality
um
I don't know
just there's something about the
chemistry that doesn't feel right to me
so it's just a feeling I just don't
think they would have it's just my guess
because obviously I don't know Carrie
Lake in person I wouldn't know what
she's like in person
but I just don't feel like it's the
right fit they're they're both a little
too bold
in in sort of too similar a way
um
Let's uh let's talk about some others
Tulsi
tulsi's got uh lovers and haters so
she's a little uh polarizing
who picks somebody who the Republicans
would love
and would be act like a sword
when Trump gets elected who would be the
biggest sword
the person that would go hardest at the
weaponized government
I don't think in Marjorie Taylor green
has the support
uh Sarah Huckabee Sanders
um
she would have to be considered I would
say she's in the mix
because in my opinion Sarah Huckabee
Sanders would not look like a stunt hire
so to me she would look like she's a
serious candidate and was hired for her
qualifications
would you agree I I don't think anybody
would say that Sarah
Huckabee Sanders
would be picked if she were picked I I
should be obviously just qualified she'd
be a good pick
um
how about uh DeSantis I'm going to say
now
and Vivek says he's not running for VP
nkin youngkin's interesting but I think
he might hold out for president
I don't know if he'd want to serve as
vice president
it'd be hard to go from Governor to vice
president wouldn't it
because Governor is kind of the you know
sort of a top and then your vice
president's sort of a bottom sort of a
sort of a hard
Road
does that happen a lot
how often have we seen Governors be VPS
historically does it oh buttons wait was
Pence acting Governor when he read
or was he once a governor
he was once a governor he wasn't acting
Governor right
he was
all right well okay I guess I don't oh
he was acting governor
okay
all right what do you think of uh Matt
Gates
what do you think of Matt Gates as a VP
pick for Trump
all right I just look at your comments
there
too polarizing
so he said too boring
he's too boring he's definitely not
boring
all right here's what I think
I think that the best VP pick for Trump
would be somebody who is unambiguously
pro-trump and always has been
so that eliminates anybody who's ever
been a Democrat I think
um I think he would not do stunt to
Casting like pick a a black person just
to pick a black person that doesn't feel
like his his vibe
I think he would pick whoever he thought
would you know work the best
well I think Matt Gates has to be in the
top three
and the reason is he would go the
hardest on the system
so Matt Gates is already proving that he
can go the hardest even on other
Republicans you know he's going after
McCarthy watching watching uh Gates go
after McCarthy
and going after everything really
suggests he's the pit bull
that somebody like Trump is going to
need because if Trump gets elected he's
going to have to clean house and it's
going to have to be vicious
I mean he's gonna have to fire just
about everybody
and
so you need somebody who's who's on
board for that and who could handle it
but one of the reasons I like the fake
you know should he not Prevail as as a
candidate
the reason I would like to see him as a
VP is that nobody nobody would think
that that's just a resting spot I mean
he would be like an active VP because
you wouldn't waste that much talent so I
always liked Al Gore
as the active partner of Bill Clinton
because they were you know roughly
similar capabilities and it really it
really thought you got two for one in
that case
and
so you need somebody like a Vivek
or a Matt Gates
to add that like super high
communication skill with young enough
and tough enough and aggressive enough
you think they could go like tear
something apart
because you know you can imagine putting
somebody like a Vivek or somebody like a
Matt gates in charge of border security
you saw what happened with Kamala was in
charge of border security
nothing right but imagine if you put
either a vague
or a Matt Gates something would happen
I mean it wouldn't be nothing and
probably something would happen
so I'll say again the Vivek is running
for president not vice president and I
still endorse him uh but Trump's a big
old Moby Dick in the way and if things
go the way the polling say
I suspected a fake would not want the VP
job because he sounds like he really
means it
um of course people always will say that
but he sounds like he needs it and
there wouldn't be that many choices
because being Trump's VP is sort of a
all-in job
let me say it this way being Trump's VP
would be all in
because you'd have to fight your way to
the presidency you know through all
kinds of trouble
so I mean it's the most uh it's the most
risky job in the world is to be his VP
didn't work out for pens too well
yeah I don't think Tim Scott Tim Scott
seems too gentle
yeah I I'm seeing the the suggestion
that you would be a good balance for
Trump because Trump is kind of scary but
Tim Scott would you know he's he's more
of a teddy bear
but I think that's why he would not be
the right choice
I feel like Trump would pick somebody
Young
and somebody who was just a sword
I think he's going to pick somebody was
just a weapon
that's what I think
that feels more in his
Larry Elders
um
how old is Larry Elder
I just don't know that the VP should be
above a certain age
yeah I wouldn't go beyond the 60s for a
VP
and I'd want young 60s as the cut off
probably because you want somebody who
can do 12 years
right
you want you want somebody who can do
Trump's four years plus eight of their
own in a perfect world if you're a
Republican
all right
um
so Russell Brand has announced that
there's some big hit pieces coming to
him he doesn't he's not specific about
what he's going to be accused of but
he's seen the list and he says there are
some crimes on there and probably in the
metoo realm we're guessing that would be
the obvious guess but he says yes he was
a womanizer but absolutely did nothing
illegal
blah blah blah
now does it seem to you a big old
coincidence
that Russell Brand would be taken off
the board if that's what's going to
happen
does or does it feel like we're in the
season as I've been telling you for a
while where everybody who's effective is
being is being removed
what do Russell Brand Tucker Carlson
Christie known Corey Lewandowski
RFK Jr we'll talk about him
and me have in common
what do all of us have in common
there's something very specific we have
in common besides being canceled
the the biggest thing we have in common
is that we're good communicators
with a certain point of view
the the most effective communicators
are being taken off the board
it seems pretty direct it feels like a
war you know it feels like Ukraine
versus Russia
where the ukrainians aren't just
targeting like just masses of troops
they're looking for choke points you
know they're looking to attack you know
like a weapons Depot or or a bridge you
know get all the choke points
and it feels like the uh you know
anybody who might someday support a
republican is being targeted to take off
the board but it looks like they're
doing it in the order of
the most let's say the clearest
communicators
that's what it looks like
yes anyway
um
so I would say that the odds of the
accusations against Russell Brand being
true
are not that high
probably not that high there's going to
be context missing and everything else
but we'll see we don't want to we don't
want to uh
don't want to Discount any serious
accusations
don't want to I don't want to say that
any accuser is lying
but if you're just to look at the
situation from you know thirty thousand
feet
in the political season it's a really
big coincidence
there's somebody like Russell Brand is
is a target
and it seems organized it's coming from
two different Outlets it looks like you
know he's clearly just being targeted
and
uh just keep an eye on this
I would say that under the situation
that he's a a person to Target
I wouldn't necessarily trust the
accusations
all right RFK Jr was at an event in
which uh heavily armed man who was
posing as uh his own bodyguard his
security his security not his bodyguard
uh was arrested so he pretended to be
RFK Junior's security he was heavily
armed
and they don't yet know why he was there
that's right he actually had a fake
badge
but the real police somehow got him and
arrested him with it without no struggle
so
obviously RFK Jr is concerned
that he unlike Obama who had full
Security even though he was a minor
candidate when he started out but
because of his special situation which
is he was a black man running for
president he got security early
RFK Jr also asked for special
consideration because he's a Kennedy and
you know he's got some history there but
he was refused he was refused to
security
does it seem that the Democrats want to
kill him it does
or or allow him to be killed so it's
probably exactly what it looks like but
I'd wait to hear what the arrested
person says
it's entirely possible that the person
who got arrested is going to say
something like
I was protecting him
like I thought there was a risk
and I was going to pretend to be a
security in case I was needed
he's going to say something like that
what he's not going to say is I was
pretending to be securely so I could you
know assassinate him he's not going to
say that
so I'd wait to see what the story says I
mean it might turn out he's got a
history of posting supportive things of
RFK Jr
so this went out this one's a wait and
see but if you think you should be
concerned about it because he could get
that far because there was not a
security
um
yeah I'd be really concerned about it
if you're not seeing the pattern yet
well according to Betty Johnson
um I'll just read you his tweet because
he says it so well on Twitter Benny
Johnson you should be following him when
the FBI originally released the fd-1023
that's a form which
they've done some investigations and
wrote down some things they found in the
investigations first they said that
Forum didn't exist
then they said oh it does exist
but then they redacted the fact that
they have audio recordings of Joe Biden
they redacted that
we didn't know what was beneath the
reductions until Senator Chuck Grassley
came forth to reveal that there are 17
audio recordings of Biden bribes now
I think it's early to say that they're
Biden bribes
so I think that's getting ahead of us
these are claims that people have heard
them I'm not I'm not ready to say that
if I heard them it would sound like a
bribe to my ears it might more sound
like a you know the mafia talk hey how's
the weather
the weather in Ukraine is
really good
good good good
how's the weather in Washington good
good good
kind of muggy yeah
how you doing you know and then then
money is exchanged so I wouldn't be
surprised if it sounds like that if we
were to hear it but the claim is
according to Betty Johnson the claim is
15 recordings of phone calls with
foreign Nationals featuring Hunter Biden
now that alone you'd have to hear the
details but just the fact that he talked
to foreign Nationals would not be
illegal but they're allegedly two
recordings of phone calls between
foreign Nationals and Joe Biden
that at least Chuck Grassley thinks
are evidence of bribes
um I would that's a wait and see I would
not trust Chuck Grassley to interpret
this for you I think you need to wait
and hear these
um
so where are these recordings and when
will they be released as Benny asks
where do you think this is real
do you think that there are genuinely 17
recordings that are damning
because they're not saying these are the
only recordings of anything that's ever
happened apparently these 17 recordings
go to something that was
close enough to something criminal they
could it got written up on the write it
down if it sounds criminal form
so if you've got a form for writing down
stuff that is you know close enough to
being criminal that you need to write it
down
and there are only 17 phone calls
presumably there were lots of calls they
both made but there were 17 they thought
were targeted uh specific enough
to what they were writing on this form
of bad behavior
that they had to be called down as
special
well wouldn't you like to hear those
yes you would I wonder if grassley's
been trying to get him and can't which
just would make the most sense he's
trying to get them and can't
do you think they'll be erased
oops
oops we lost them where did you lose
them oh they're with Hunters gone and
his diamond
and there's laptops we lose a lot of
things oh whenever Hunter is involved
we're losing stuff like crazy we can't
find our diamonds or our guns or our
laptops or our audio recordings I think
it's going to go that way
oops lost
well you know if you've been listening
to me for a while you would say to
yourself
Scott I know you do not want Joe Biden
to be you know running in this race
because you don't want Joe Biden to be
your president
to which I'd say well I've softened on
that a little bit
now that now that Biden is so obviously
gone
yeah we've reached the point where you
can't really debate it anymore am I
right
and for all these who
told me that Biden was just fine and
there was no reason that he couldn't
last four years do you owe me a
apology yet for saying on day one that
he was too old and this was too much of
a risk for the country because I thought
he looked like he would be exactly where
he is
before the election to me it looked like
all he had to do is straight line his
Decline and we would be exactly where we
are exactly right now
Who besides me a lot of you said the
same thing right but who Who besides me
needs a apology
I do I need a apology
for anybody who thought that was
unreasonable
that was not unreasonable
yeah
so
uh I like to be right
but here's what I'd like I'd like Joe
Biden to win the nomination
and I would like to spend months and
months and months watching him decompose
in front of the who
thought this was a good idea I want them
to watch him
turn into Moss right in front of us
while Trump strolls into the capital
bill or Scrolls into the Oval Office
with his sword who will be his vice
president whoever that is and watch him
just decapitate all the
who need to go
decapitate not physically because we
don't like violence I'm talking about
firing people and cleaning houses stuff
like this and I want the entire
Democratic Party
for months to know what's coming
I don't want any surprises I want them
to watch their candidate who they picked
doing exactly what we said he was going
to do
decompose and embarrass the out of
the country I want our country to be so
embarrassed by election day
that you can barely show your eyes
that's what I want so yeah I was used to
think oh you know wouldn't it be good if
Biden is not even a choice
but since there's now no chance he can
win am I right we're Way Beyond the
point where he has a chance of winning
unless unless they cheat so massively
that you can't get away with it see I've
got a feeling that the real decision
is can they cheat enough to push him
across the finish line
and I don't think they can
I don't think it would be possible to
cheat that much and not get caught in a
weird pandemic election where nobody
knows what the Baseline should look like
because the rules change for the
pandemic and then Trump is a rule
changer as well everything's different
you can kind of get away with you know
if it happened I'm not saying it there's
no evidence that the election was rigged
that I'm aware of
but if they did this is all hypothetical
you could maybe get away with some you
know Small Change in a few precincts but
if he had to do something big it's the
only way you could win well it's going
to be obvious
going to be obvious so yes I want Joe
Biden to run because we are beyond the
point where there's any question
whatsoever of whether he could win he
can't
is completely over
there is no way not a single way that
Joe Biden could win the presidency again
does anybody disagree with that this is
it's up to zero it's literally zero
they're going to run a candidate who has
zero chance
if things go the way they're going now
obviously the Democrats are going to
scramble like crazy to try to claw him
out of there before the nomination
but at this point they are running a
candidate who actually has no chance of
winning none
he's going to be he's going to be hooked
up to tubes before election day
I mean he's just completely gone
so I'm down for the uh the show let's
just have some fun watching uh
Trump
do his thing for several months and have
our laughs and
and then he's gone
all right we there's a new report that
uh
that I guess Jill Biden it was a big
supporter of Randy Weingarten and the
teachers unions and promised to get her
in there the first day that Joe was
elected and she did and uh
apparently Randy weingarten's uh
preferences about kids returning to
school
were the ones that
change the administration's point of
view
so she was in charge of whether children
got into school because she swayed the
government
and now that's been reported
I wonder if that would have been
reported before the Democrats wanted
Biden to be gone
so yeah Randy Weingarten seems to be
um behind
most of the problems in the country
most of the problems in the country
because I think she is the biggest thing
behind systemic racism
you know the school system is too bad
and she's keeping it stable for the
benefit of the teachers I guess
so
wow
all right and the the piece that talks
about her in a way that I would think
would not be super flattering is a
writer who he's got a book out Franklin
four but I guess he writes for the
Atlantic
now the Atlantic if you didn't know is
super Democrat
would a super Democrat or somebody
associated with a super Democrat entity
write a unflattering piece about the
power of the teachers union unless Joe
Biden was no longer the favorite
President of Democrats
I feel like I feel like every member of
the media
has some kind of
explicit orders that now they can
start poking you know anything that's
Biden related they can start poking at
it
all right um
apparently the tick tock Army you know
the Democrats Tick Tock Army of
influencers that they pay
uh
three quarters of their funding comes
from George Soros
are there any paid people on X are there
influencers who are paid on X or is it
only a tick tock thing
and why wouldn't they do it on the other
platforms
so there are paid influencers on x
do you think there should be a law that
if you're a paid influencer you should
have to disclose
should you have to disclose if you're a
paid influencer
I think you should
every everything else with
um contributions has to be disclosed
right that's a standard and is there any
are there are these disclosed or is that
how we know maybe they are disclosed
maybe that's how we know about them is
there a list somewhere that lists them
so it's all legal
I would define an influencer as someone
who is specifically taking money to be
an influencer so it has to have money
involved
they deny it do that
uh who has standards
yeah the crisis teams are they paid at
this point I don't know don't know
anything about that
but here's my question why do we call
Tick Tock this so-called Tick Tock Army
of influencers
paid by George Soros why do we call them
influencers instead of traitors aren't
they actually just Traders
if you're taking money to influence
politics and the reason you're
influencing them is because you took
money
I would say you're a traitor and it
wouldn't matter if you were
supporting Trump or somebody else
it doesn't matter who they're who
they're
influencing if they're taking money
to pretend to have an opinion to
influence people
that's not what the United States is
the United States is a you better show
us your work you know you can say
anything you want as long as you say
it's a political ad right that's the
standard you could have an ad that has a
whole bunch of lies in it but it just
has to be labeled the political ad who
paid for it
so I think that there should be a law
that whenever one of these influencers
does that does a real
that they have to put at the bottom or
maybe the system does that it's a paid
political ad paid political end
yeah but to me it's a traitorous it's
traitorous to pretend that you have an
opinion when you're paid to have the
opinion because that's that's directly
um
that's directly going against the system
that's not just trying to give somebody
elected that's trying to destroy the
system and that's traitorous
so I would call them Tick Tock Traders
in my opinion
and I'd also like to know which ones
they were so that whenever they tick
tock
somebody can go in and call them Traders
I want to do people do that already or
do they block those is there a way to
block on Tick Tock or does somebody go
in the TTT is Tick Tock Traders
they do they do have blocking or they do
have comments they do have blocking
well there should be somebody labeling
on them all exactly what they are
uh in fentanyl news which I never
believe
I think all news about fentanyl's
 but the son of imprisoned
Mexican drug lord El Chapo who I guess
the son is took over the fentanyl trade
he was extradited to the United States
on Friday to face fentanyl trafficking
charges
and it's a boost for the Biden
Administration pushed to curb the spread
of deadly opioids the Biden
Administration does not want to
stop the spread of deadly opioids
clearly they don't want to do that
you wouldn't you wouldn't have everybody
just streaming over the Border if you
wanted to stop fentanyl although I don't
think border security is how you stop it
but
you know it'll be one small tool
um here's something I forgot the same
guy that's being extradited the son of
El Chapo he was briefly arrested in
northern city and he was briefly
arrested in Mexico once before in 2019
but do you know why he was he was
released
do you know why El Chapo's son who
clearly is running the cartel
do you know why he was released
the president released him to avoid
Bloodshed because the cartels got
violence violent about it
they let him go because the cartels made
them let him go
that's a real thing the president of the
country
let that of the cartel go
because the cartel told them to
and got really violent
wow
that tells me everything you need to
know so I don't think we understand
all the details behind how this guy
could get picked up
but what changed
you know wouldn't wouldn't the cartels
now get violent again
so why was he successfully uh extradited
and imprisoned this time something
changed so there's something that
changed
probably had to do something with a
cartel leadership you know maybe there
was a different leader for the cartel
who made a different yeah imagine if you
were number two at the cartel
and you went to the CIA or whoever you
could get to he said hey I'll make you a
deal
if you could get rid of number one
I'll be running the cartel but I won't
do Fentanyl anymore
I'll do everything I was doing before
but no fentanyl you just have to get rid
of my my competition
I mean it feels like there's some kind
of deal
doesn't it like there's some part of
this you don't know about that would
really explain
what's going on here
the mouse was the most violent
is that what he's called the mouse
anyway
Jonathan Turley writes a big thread you
know if Charlie were not working
and explaining all the legal stuff I
don't think I would understand any of it
he does by far the best job
of breaking down you know what happened
and then why that matters just the best
communicator
anyway he talks he tells us that Jack
Smith one of Trump's uh many prosecutors
uh late on Friday so you do things late
on Friday so the news doesn't pick it up
uh he filed a sweeping motion to seek a
gag order on Trump
so that Trump would not talk about
either the witnesses or the attorneys in
the case
uh he said it would narrowly tailored so
it's not that he can't talk in general
it's he can't talk about individuals in
the case
and that would stop him from talking
about the most important part
of the election while he's running for
election
so it's a gag order that would stop the
presumptive next president
from free speech
on a topic that is Central to his
campaign
it's unbelievable that this is a real
thing that really happened in the United
States
so I would suggest the following
uh he should
Trump should
flagrantly violate this and see what
happens
it's easy for me to say right do you
think they would jail them
what would they do
would they put him in jail and how long
would you go to jail
like a day
what what so it would be contempt right
it would be some kind of contempt thing
but wouldn't they wouldn't they argue it
to the Supreme Court and they say Hey
you know I get why this exists I get why
there are gag orders but in the context
of running for the United States
presidency
and in the context where the thing you
have the gag order on is a probably the
central question of the of the entire
race which is the weaponized government
the weaponized government is the number
one issue in the race in my opinion
in my opinion it's the number one issue
so
if you were to push on that and you know
they they acted on it wouldn't it
immediately go to the Supreme Court
because it's a free speech of a
presidential candidate
that it would go straight to the
circular court right I mean it has to go
through steps but
I I feel like you wouldn't go to jail
for doing it despite and then he could
become president and pardon himself
you know the moment the moment that
Trump looks like he's going to become
president like when everybody is sure
all all of the controls are off because
the moment he's sure he's going to be
president
he can just pardon himself for anything
he says after that
am I wrong no or would it be a state
charge not a federal charge
I always get I always get confused what
is a state Sergeant what is a federal
charge on these
all right well anyway you might see him
get a lot more Free Speech but I have
this following question about exactly
what is illegal
so Trump himself
would be barred from uh you know crap
talking the witnesses and the lawyers
but suppose he told somebody who is his
designated crap talker
like I would volunteer
for example I say I will be his
designated crap talker and then he could
send me a secret message
and say uh say that Jack Smith has a
messy beard he has a messy beard
and then I'll I'll go on and say
you know I I don't know what president
Trump is thinking
but I think he's thinking that Jack
Smith has a messy beard
and if I were him
I would come up with a nickname of
Jack messy beard Smith
and then everybody would say wait that's
Trump saying that and I would say
no
he's not barred from private
conversations
is he is he Bart from a private
conversation
can he not say to Melania I don't like
that prosecutor
it doesn't work that way right it's only
as public
it's his public statements so if you
were to privately say to you know Don Jr
who privately told me just making
something up here
could I not say exactly what Trump would
have said because I would know
and then just say it and could I not get
thousands of other Republicans just say
it the same way in their own words
now if I quoted him
and and it was a known relationship then
I would imagine that would violate the
gag order because he'd just be using
somebody else as a voice
but if you were to Simply explain what
areas he thought needed criticism and
explain it in a way that I could put it
into my own words
would that be illegal
suppose I simply was aware of his
thoughts because he told me
could I not put in my own words what I
thought about
somebody's private thoughts
I don't know well hearsay
I don't think hearsay applies
yeah sloppy Smith
worse nothing
Smith it's an old reference old comic
reference
if you enjoyed prison you could do it
how would I go to prison for putting
my own opinion out there that just
happened to match the president's
or the potential future president
yeah he's got a scruffy beard it's a
messy beard
there's a lot of soup in that beard is
all I'm saying
yeah call him soup beard
you you would never see him the same if
you called him a soup beard
because you would always just imagine
their soup in his beard
soup beer
it doesn't roll off the tongue because
soup beard those words they don't they
don't sound good together
yes
hey Sue beard
was there a kind of soup a chowder a
chowder beard
uh
all right
so uh Tesla is winning and it looks like
they're going to win more so Tesla does
not have unionized workers I think Tesla
pays them more than the union pays them
but the unions for the other car makers
are asking for Fairly substantial raises
which would make it even harder for them
to make money
compared to Tesla meanwhile I didn't
know this until today but back in March
musk said he had a plan
to reduce the
manufacturing cost of a Tesla by 50
percent
musk thinks he can reduce the cost of
manufacturing a Tesla
by 50 percent
mostly through automation
so you know he's building robots so he's
a robot maker if you're a robot maker
the odds of you doing a good job
automating your car manufacturing is
pretty good pretty pretty good
so do you think you could do that do you
think you can reduce his manufacturing
costs by 50 percent
that would that would be a hell of an
ask you know in the past when he's given
objectives of what he plans to
accomplish he's actually exceeded them
like he's he's done things earlier than
he said he would do them
so I think he can do this actually
so it does suggest that the other card
makers are just absolutely screwed
all right how many of you saw the viral
video of
two guys in Vegas murdering a guy on a
bicycle for fun
they just run him down for fun how many
of you saw that
so it's on the social media today
and there the two guys in the car are
chatting away looks like I guess it was
a stolen car
they got masks on and they you know they
hid the car
on the highway do a hit and run and then
they see a guy to Bicycle up ahead and
they say should we hit him
and they decide to just hit him and I
think he killed him
and it turns out he was a retired police
chief
retired police chief made it all the way
through the police chiefing and then
were killed by two criminals we're just
riding this bike
now
there may be a racial element to this
story
but I'm not going to talk about it
because every time we fall for the the
racial narrative
we get we get pulled into the wrong
place
and I would rather have the narrative
that there there were two individuals
who should be dead
and that's the whole story there's just
two people who are just the worst human
beings but as soon as you get it out of
the individual range then you're you're
in their trap
yeah you're falling in a trap so I'm
just not going to talk about things as
the average list versus the average that
because I know what you want to do is
you know put some graphs on social media
saying the average of this group is
worse than the average in this group but
there aren't any average people
so I don't know these two people
but I know they're not average black
people
they're very much not average they're
very individual terrible people who I
think should be killed you know legally
or or illegally by the family of the
people they killed that would be fine
with me too
um
but
yeah it look it looked like a hit except
they didn't know who the guy was I don't
think
so I'm not going to treat it like it's a
uh some kind of a
I don't know a uh signal of all things
racial it's a signal that there's two
very very bad people who did a very bad
thing and I hope the worst possible
outcome for them
so
uh yes so others have asked where's the
media outrage
and the answer is that the person who
got hit was a white man
nobody really cares when a white man is
murdered
do they
when was the last time have we as
anybody ever cared when a white man got
murdered I can't think of a single time
can you name anytime anybody cared about
a white person being murdered a white
man white women yes but white man
Jesus well I'm not sure we're calling
Jesus not a person of color
I Think Jesus might have been
Browner than you but I don't know
uh Lincoln Lincoln
[Laughter]
well JFK yeah JFK but JFK wasn't killed
for you know racial reasons obviously as
everybody in the case where there was a
outcry
based on racial reasons when a white man
was killed
I've never heard of one
yeah so let's let's stop pretending the
P that Society cares about the death of
white men
because they very much don't
Lincoln was shot for racial reasons
by a Democrat you're saying all right I
accept that
who posted the video that's a good
question
yeah why is it that anybody had access
to that video because it was just taken
on the perpetrator's own phone I think
oh the guys that Kyle written have shot
you're right yeah so as long as the
perpetrators were
pedophiles and Democrat criminals then
there is an outcry that's true oh
there's Seth rich but that wasn't
necessarily
racial
you're related to John Wilkes Booth how
about that
all right well that ladies and gentlemen
is all we wanted to talk about today
um
stretch that feels good
um
looking at your comments just to see if
I missed anything interesting
please fix the locals.com what's wrong
with it
locals is working fine at the moment
uh
does anybody have any uh oh I I
yeah so let me give you some advice you
want some advice
so there are three things that we hear
are good uh Dr Andrew huberman talks
about these at least two of them so one
of them is he says make sure you stand
in the sun before 10 A.M
getting a little Sun before 10 a.m is
good for you
the other one is breathing you know the
two inhales to the nose followed by one
exhale
and the third one is grounding now I
don't know that he talks about grounding
but you know people do the grounding is
the idea if you stand Barefoot and
outside in the dirt that I don't know
some kind of thing that happens what is
it that happens when you
stand in the dirt of the grass
you get some kind of uh not ionization
no
your electrical system gets grounded or
something
anyway
so here's what I did yesterday
I walked I walked in my front yard
before 10 A.M
I stood on my grass
in the Sun and I did my breathing
I did all three at the same time
so you get the Sun the breathing and the
standing in the Grass at the same time
it was it was the best use of time
and I swear
that
maybe two to three minutes of that and I
was in actually a good mood all day
now I'm going to try it again
because I don't know if it was a
coincidence but I was actually in a real
good mood all day long
with that so do the three things yeah
Barefoot in the grass
do the two inhales through your nose
followed by the one long exhale that's
the huberman method and he also tells
you to get in the sun before 10 a.m so
just do all three
two minutes of the best
um
Health adjustment you could ever have
and drink some coffee yeah
all right
that's all I got for you today I'm going
to go do some other stuff
and thanks for joining YouTube
you've been amazing
see you tomorrow
