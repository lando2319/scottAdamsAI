[Music]
hey everybody come on in we're almost
[Music]
ready now a lot of people don't know
that I I do hang out a lot with the
hosts of uh MSN n
BC yeah we hang out do a lot of hanging
out and Joy Reid was here the other day
she left her hair so Joy reads
[Music]
here good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams a
special uh July 4th Independence Day or
at least one of them and if you'd like
to take your January or J what the hell
is this month I feel like Joe Biden July
4th Everything feels like it should be
January 6 but July
4th if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny human
brains smooth as they are all you need
for that is copper mugger glass of
tanker gelstein a again sugar flask of
best of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for for the unparallel pleasure
dope mean here the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens
now
Perfection you know I understand that um
there are a lot of creators who are
taking the day off taking the day off oh
my goodness aren't you glad I'm
here and then worse you turn on your
favorite show
you know let's say you're going to watch
the five it's like five different people
you're like no no that's not the five
that's five different people that should
be a different show but not here I'm the
original well if you subscribe to the
Dilbert reborn comic which you can only
see on X by subscription or that plus
lots of other stuff on locals at Scot
adams. locals.com you know that Wall-E
my uh useless member of the
office um he sometimes tries to get away
with not
working his new trick is to uh put a
neurolink chip in his head and claim
that he's working while he's just
sitting
there now I think that that's kind of
brilliant anyway you you'll see that in
in the dver comic
today uh the question of the day and I
think an important one is we'll talk
about this some more but let's say for
example KL Harris runs as either vice
president or the top of the ticket and
what if she doesn't make
it you know you can't really go back to
the Senate right after you've been vice
president doesn't feel like you I mean
you can but doesn't feel like it'd be a
you know a step forward so what she
going to do now my suggestion is that
she should start a uh a car towing
company
a car towing company yeah and I was I
was brainstorming before we went live
here I was talking to the subscribers on
locals and uh they had some ideas for
what would be the the name of the
business so if K Harris had a car towing
company what would you call
it some of the suggestions were
hotto very unkind that's unkind it's
uncalled
for um
my suggestion was
kamalo
kamalo and if you think that that's
naughty well I think that's in your mind
because that's her name and that's what
they do they tell
things um but I think the um the best
name was suggested by somebody on locals
who said uh should call it a blow and
toe okay that's a winner blow and toe
all right there's a uh study that says
that when people take
tests as in
examinations and they do it in a room
with a high ceiling they don't do as
well do you believe that do you believe
that when people take tests that the
height of the ceiling makes a difference
in their
performance what do you think does that
sound like real science or fake science
I think it's probably real let me tell
you an experience I had
yesterday I had a some jackhammering
happening in part of my house as I often
do and I was trying to find it any place
that was you know less Jackhammer noise
but I could work so I've got a portable
worktable it's got wheels and I can you
know take it anywhere I want in the
house and I had the hardest time trying
to figure out where I could put it that
I would feel like work it's really hard
so you have to have exactly the right
you know fun way the right space the
right you feel or in my case I just
can't work so for example in the morning
when I have to do my most intense
concentration uh I keep the dra the
drapes closed and I keep it dark because
I can't even have I can't even have
visual distractions anywhere except
right around my workspace makes a big
difference so I had to go to a room
where I could darken it you know
blackout curtains and had to find just
the right space and then I was great the
work was easy but I do I have noticed
that high
ceilings are a problem like you can
actually feel the difference with the
high ceiling here's my here's what I
think it is I think that humans and even
animals we like to be in a safe little
cave
and if the ceiling is low enough that
you have like a feeling of a ceiling
then you feel like you're safe because
that's one fewer place that they can
attack you it's like I see the ceiling
they can't get to me but if the ceiling
is high I can see how you lose a sense
that there is a
ceiling which would feel would make you
feel exposed which if you're male
especially it would turn on your your
defense
instincts so it's like you know when men
go into the restaurant they're they're
checking for the entrances and the exits
and the the attack vectors and they're
picking a seat based on the war that's
going to happen in their
head I think that you can't do a test
and concentrate if you also have to
concentrate about your self-defense so I
think that's what that
is you know what you rarely see you
rarely see people working
outdoors I mean you see it but if you
take me Outdoors
um I have a problem I have a problem
working just because there's it's
outdoors so I I actually believe that
one I think that high ceilings make a
difference all right it's not guaranteed
they have to you know they'd have to do
more tests do you remember Sam Brinton
he was the gender fluid uh Biden
official who's no longer a Biden staffer
and not staffer but he was he was in the
administration and he
was uh caught stealing luggage and then
wearing the outfits from the luggage and
he's not going to jail and he's not
going to
jail
um so he's going to get mental health
treatment
instead so he's a uh mustached shaved
head individual who sometimes is man and
sometimes is
woman and uh the hint that he might have
some mental problems was that he was
stealing
clothes and they said stealing
clothes that's weird you might have some
mental problems and he said well I was
doing a good job of covering it up until
now and so what we've learned is that
you can take the identity of
women but not their clothes No don't
touch their clothes cuz you're going to
go to the mental institution if you do
that
all right well you get some mental
therapy um breb Breitbart is reporting
ironically that Jim Jordan is is GNA get
some testimony from some corporate
Executives because there's this big
advertising group called
garm um it's a some oh no it's an
initiative of the World Federation of
advertisers so you probably didn't know
there was a world eration of advertisers
and the the allegation is that they have
colluded hey it sounds like they're
doing garbage pickup on 4th of July I
can hear a garbage truck H maybe
anyway
um so the uh this group garm that's a
subset of that larger group of
advertisers uh are allegedly have
allegedly coordinated
to uh discriminate against some
conservative leaning entities Chief
among them would be Breitbart Fox News
and daily
wire and here's here's my
suggestion you know when uh when the
founders came up with their ideas about
Free Speech the world was a different
place so the things that they could
contemplate you know was limited they
couldn't see that far in the future of
course but the a weird aspect of free
speech in the modern world is that it's
often tied to
advertisers meaning that if no
Advertiser wants to give you money for
what you do to be on you know to have an
advertisement um then it's hard to do it
hard to do it so I'm wondering if there
shouldn't be some kind of
legislation that says you can't
distinguish um by somebody's political
leanings
now their ad their argument would be oh
we don't want to pair our advertisements
with this unpleasant person or or
philosophy to which I say we should get
over
that you know I I think we should just
have a law that says you can't
discriminate where you advertise
strictly based on the fact that there
might be some advertising that is
conservative now it' be one thing if you
if you simply chose one entity over
another and you chose ones that you know
were left leaning but if you're using
some kind of General platform where
everybody should be advertising if they
can if it's legal and everybody should
be using the platform if they want to I
think in those cases where sort of a
quasi public but not really I feel like
there should be a a limitation about
discriminating against some kinds of
speech I know I'm I don't love more
regulations but this seems like it would
just be supporting free speech in the
modern version of it if you disagreed
with that I don't think I would follow
you for
it if you want to be a purist and say
free speech is just the government it's
not corporations they can do what they
want I would I would entertain that
argument I just think that in a
practical sense if advertising is
driving our speech it needs to be a
little bit equally applied
um all
right the Wall Street Journal editorial
board wants us to know that there's no
such thing as a magga supreme court
meaning that if you look at the
decisions that came out uh there were
some that went by party let's say um by
the presumed bias of the court so
63 would look like they just lined up by
their bias but it turns out that I think
the majority of the decision
at least one person crossed over in many
cases they were
unanimous so if you really look at the
full body of work it's actually quite
credible quite credible you know I don't
like it when it's 63 that's to me that's
sketchy but there weren't that many if
you look at the full body they they had
lots of Crossovers and unity Etc and why
that's
important is it makes it almost impos
imposs possible to pack the
court if you told me all the decisions
went
63 and then you said the Democrats don't
like that so they're going to pack the
court I would have said well I don't
like that but you have a good
argument if they were all
63 and Democrats said we can't live with
that we're going to have to pack the
court I I wouldn't even complain about
it because if they were all 63 it would
tell me we don't really have a court
anyway it's just a right so you
know I probably would have said let's
get you know I if it were me my perfect
world is its its balance that the court
is four and
four that would be my perfect situation
because if you can't break that 44 you
know bias maybe it shouldn't shouldn't
be done maybe that's good enough reason
not to do it if you can't get past the
if you can't get one person on the other
team to say all right that's reasonable
maybe you shouldn't do it know I do like
54 just in the sense they usually have a
majority um well usually
always so anyway I don't think the
Court's going to get packed so if you
thought that was a risk I think that
risk is way way down just because the
court was credible in their
decisions I would like i' like to uh
once again call out the dog not barking
but in this case in a real good way the
dog that isn't barking is
Trump you know the old saying that when
your enemy is destroying itself don't
get involved stay out of it and so Biden
and the Democrats are destroying
themselves and Trump is just deliciously
staying out of it just deliciously I
mean every day he doesn't get into it
you know and just sort of plays around
the
edges is a good day for him because the
biggest thing he has to worry about is
he looks chaotic and out of
control every day that Trump says I can
control this watch I don't even have to
say anything today because there's no
reason to um I'll say it again the
advice that Trump is getting I don't
know who it's from is just excellent and
he gets the credit you know the
candidate gets the credit for what
advice they take and which advisors they
listen to so the candidate gets the
credit but that doesn't stop it doesn't
stop me from noticing that the advice is
just the best he's ever had by far you
can just see it in
everything all right so have you seen
the Trump leaked uh golf
video um I don't know if I can call it
up here I'm going to try to go full
Boomer I have no idea what's going to
happen next oh this is
funny let's
see I don't know if I can get a video on
these let's
see uh if I view the tab over here
[Music]
[Music]
okay I can't stop laughing at
that that's not the one I wanted to show
you
though oh have you seen this
one so let's do this's gonna bring all
these Jaws back well how exactly are you
gonna do that what magic wand do you
have now what you watching for is my
book
in the
[Music]
back the energy in this ritual
[Applause]
is this is a
[Music]
perfect unbelievable you just feel
it m president pardon me ma'am M
president M president that's enough put
down the mic
is Nascar signs in the
background Donald Trump keeper of promis
there it is qu
[Music]
bigley by the way is this working you
can see it
right not entirely sure why you can see
and why you can't all right
go back
here but I wanted to show you uh Trump's
where is he I think it went past
it Trump's uh video that came out uh the
oh this is
good me know when you guys are finished
fighting amongst yourselves who I got to
vote for in November to keep Hitler out
the White House that's all I want to
know who I got to vote for to keep
Hitler out the White House y'all do your
thing play in traffic all you want in
front of these Republicans acting a fool
in front of these people instead of
privately declaring your stuff but don't
text me no more cuz I'm not taking no
more of these
texts just let me know when you guys are
finished figuring it out Democrats
because I know y'all the Freak Out
people go ahead and freak out have your
conversation now am I wrong to say that
that's obvious mental health
problem is that just am I just being
political am I being biased
or can everyone see
that that is just
100% mental health problem and when I
watch Rachel madow I have the same same
reaction it's like that's just mental
health you know I don't even hear what
she says politically politically is just
nonsense but to when do we when do we
get when do we get to stop pretending
it's political because that's not
helping us at
all we're just in this iCal world where
where this is part of the political
process it's not all right why can't I
find Trump on his golf
cart I'll find
it Trump on his golf
court okay that's so weird
because oh here's something new
check this
out this is uh Joel Pollock's um
book just hit it's called agenda what
Trump should do in his first 100
days now I have to tell you I saw a
early version of this I've got a uh
endorsement on it and it's one of the
most exciting things I've ever seen now
you're not going to believe this because
Joel's a friend so it sounds like I'm
just you know being nice to a friend I
actually got chills when I read it so
what it is it's a very small book that
is just uh how many
ideas um basically it's a whole bunch of
executive orders or things along those
or things like executive orders that
Trump could do immediately upon getting
an
office now remember the uh there's that
Heritage report that something 2025
report is scaring every Bu The Heritage
Foundation has their own you know big
300 Page thing that's kind of scary but
it's not exactly what Trump would do you
know it's not exactly you know in line
with what he would want to do but I
think this might be a little more to
your uh
liking um where do you see how many good
ideas there is I mean it's just like one
good idea after another and they're all
doable so so imagine like you know just
dozens and dozens of doable ideas that
you can do on day one it's actually
really inspirational I recommend
it all right but that's not what I was
trying to
do I can't find that video I don't know
why anyway so let's talk about it
there's a a leaked video of trump um in
his golf course golf cart talking to I
think a cat and maybe some people some
fans or something and The Daily Beast
leaks it it's this grainy video in which
uh Trump is you know saying asking how
he did in the debate and then he starts
talking about uh Biden so on video he
calls Biden an old broken down pile of
crap and then he talks about kamla
because he says it's going to be kamla
he goes I think she's going to do better
she's bad so IC now I think he said
she's an effing did I hear that
correctly or am I having an audio
illusion did you hear him say
that and then here's the fun part and
then he takes down a $20 bill I think it
was a 20 and you know gives a nice tip
to whoever it was that he was talking
to so Ju Just think about this setup it
was a you know a hidden video somebody
must had their camera in their pocket or
something and and he's on camera calling
his competition old broken down pile of
crap and the other one uh pathetic and
she's just a effing bat I think he said
that then Trump himself posted on true
social and here's the only comment he
puts on it he posts the secret video of
him saying that and the only the only
words he puts on it
in all capital
letters no tax on
tips the the only thing he wants you to
remember from that is that he gave a
nice tip to the guy no tax on
tips now
again my guess is that was probably just
you know Trump himself you know that
that looks like his instincts but how
could that be more perfect
they to imagine that the Democrats have
anything that can compete with
this they don't I don't think they have
any understanding the level of subtlety
and entertainment and intelligence that
Trump is bringing because they're just
seeing the joy read Hitler movie imagine
if you're in the joy readed mental
breakdown Hitler movie and you're
missing the funniest movie ever I mean
he's he's doing catty Shack uh you know
at the same time he's running for
offense it doesn't get better than
that oh maybe it does then there was a
trump official some kind of letter press
release or something uh talking about
the collapsing Democratic party you know
sort of dancing on the grave but one of
the one of the descriptions of KLA
Harris this is in writing this is
official you know official document from
the Trump campaign and and here's how
they refer to Kam Harris the vice
president of the United States the
cackling
co-pilot K Harris cackling co-pilot K
Harris oh my God that's good cackling
co-pilot that's so good it's not even a
vice president she's like a co-pilot
because she has to be there you know
with her hands on the steering whe at
the same time she's not the one that
they say is there anybody here who can
fly a plane she's got to have her hands
the hands on the whatever you call that
in an airplane
anyway so Joe Biden did another one of
his cuckoo clock um appearances you know
the cuckoo clock where he just walks out
like a cuckoo in a clock walks out
cuckoo and then goes right back without
any questions so they thought he would
look kind of
presidential uh because he would just
walk out and do his thing and go
back but
um I don't know if anybody saw the video
of him trying to
walk he's the only person who can walk
like he has
dementia like I I mean it's I don't know
how you could broadcast your mental
state any more clearly in the way you
walk it's a complete
disaster and the fact that his debate
was so bad is the only reason you don't
see it for the disaster it was he
couldn't walk a straight line without
looking like he was mentally
degraded now I mean it's hard to pull
off but he did
it apparently uh so Hunter Biden was in
attendance and I don't think I've seen
him that wi died since he was snorting
parmesan off the
carpet
um and so now the question is uh
representative Mike Turner is asking the
question is Hunter Biden receiving
classif IED briefings in the white
house if we know that Hunter Biden is
now the you know maybe the single most
important adviser to the president under
his degraded State wouldn't Hunter Biden
also need to
be you know have the highest clearance
because how can he really help unless he
knew everything that there is to know
that's
important so I doubt he's getting
classified
briefings and I doubt he's hearing
secret things but he might be the the
fact that we can't rule that
out just just adds to the
story now here's the question I have to
you if if you don't know who's running
the country and it could be Obama could
be Jill Biden could be Jill could be Joe
Biden could be
kamla you know who's who's running the
country right now uh but it could be
Hunter of all those characters who would
you feel most comfortable in making
decisions about the fate of your
country you know here's the weird
part I might pick
hunter yeah here's the thing Hunter is
genuinely smarter than
kamla he's genuinely smarter than um Joe
Biden at the moment
I'm not sure Obama has you know has our
best interests in mind at the
moment
and I don't know much about Jill Biden
some people say Jill Biden is brilliant
by the way if you haven't heard that
you've heard it now but I don't know
that the the weird thing is that if
those were your only
choices you might actually go for a
hunter that's the weird part now I'm not
saying he would go do a good job and of
course you have all the problems of his
own problems and you know maybe that
gets complicated too but I don't
know of that group he might be the star
of the group now here's what people seem
to be worried about that they should not
they're worried that our enemies will
take advantage of us and try to do
something to attack
us that's the last thing you should
worry about
because let me let me get you into the
mind of a uh evil enemy of the United
States who would ever attack Us number
one you got to be really sure you're
going to finish us off because we have
nuclear weapons can you really attack
the United States and destroy all our
nuclear weapons before we launch no
nobody thinks they can nobody would take
that choice but suppose it wasn't
nuclear and they thought they could just
you know get away with something
here's the problem if you attack the
United States when it doesn't have clear
leadership we will re we will retaliate
so that part you could you could depend
on so even with a degraded president
it's a 100% chance that he would say
yeah fight back I mean he do understand
that so the military would do what it
does so there's no chance whatsoever
that there would not be a strong
response it might be delayed a week or
something
but there would be a strong response so
that's that's what the enemies need to
know but there's even better reason not
to
attack if you want to attack somebody
you want
predictability you don't always know if
you're going to win a war but you want a
predictability about how the other side
will respond if they're in the position
of either winning or losing and you
don't want to get into a battle with a
nuclear power who doesn't have somebody
who could say
no you need somebody who can negotiate a
peace deal and if they don't have an
effective leader you could end up
starting a war that can't be
stopped it's the stopping the war that's
the important part right everybody can
start one stopping is the hard part how
hard was it to start a war in Ukraine
pretty easy how hard is it to stop it
really really hard so you don't want to
be on the other end of American weaponry
and no chance it's going to stop you
want to at least say oh oh sorry sorry
didn't mean to attack you you're
right let's let's settle this to have
the scariest thing would be somebody who
has you know unlimited
nuclear power and there's nobody you can
talk to that's scary so I guarantee you
we we might be the safest we've ever
been from an attack on the
Homeland oddly we're the safest we've
ever been so it's the opposite that
there's not even a single chance that
we're going to get attacked and you know
what the other reason we won't get
attacked is because people don't attack
you when you're busy destroying
yourself and if if you're watching this
from another country you're thinking you
know what let this run a few months
because it looks like they're just
destroying themselves it would be the
last thing they'd want to do would be to
attack us and unify us behind a strong
president because that's what would
happen we would be instantly
unified and we would be unified behind
somebody strong and it wouldn't be Joe
Biden might be Hunter no I'm just
kidding it wouldn't be Hunter we we
would unify and it would happen fast so
no there's no chance there's no risk
whatsoever somebody's going to attack us
because Joe Biden is degraded none that
that is that is the most zero risk that
we have in every category none that's
zero zero zero risk so stop worrying
about
it all right uh The Huffington Post has
an idea and wokeness is reporting this
on X that uh they they're suggesting
that AI be used to smooth out Biden's
presentations in other words it would
still be Biden but maybe an enhanced
Biden with a little AI so you don't see
the dumb
parts can you believe believe that
that's actually a published
opinion that that Biden is so far gone
and the Democrats are so far into TDS
delusion Joy Reed style that they're
literally saying out loud in public you
know maybe we should just run Ai and
tell you it's the
president I don't even have a comment
about that that is so uh w wildly
indicative of where we're
at that it just tells its own story
there's nothing to add to that it's like
really well I guess I always add that
really really you're just going to
pretend that the person in charge is not
degraded by making some AI cheap
fake all
right but uh I don't think you're going
to need any of that if this uh upcoming
interview I guess tomorrow there'll be
the interview we'll see of President
Biden with George
slopis if I pronounce that right
soplos and uh it's a 15minute interview
and it's
recorded and it's being done by the
number one fan of Democrats George
soplos now given that it will be a two
camera shoot at least mightbe three
um which means that they can cut from
this reaction to this person talking to
wide shot Etc that gives them everything
they need to edit but not just edit edit
in a way you can't tell remember we saw
Biden doing trying to give his I know
little commercial where it was just him
talking but they had to edit it eight
times so and you can see all the edits
well you wouldn't see these edits
because they would do the edit you know
they' use a different camera angle and
then stick in the edit that
way so we're never going to know what
they cut out it's going to be like the
her report all over again we're going to
see something that looks
mildly
capable and we're going to have no idea
if it's real no way to
know I suppose the only way um I think
the only way ABC News could prove that
was real is to make available the I I
think what they'll have is two cameras
over the shoulders so you can see the
view of each of the people talking but
probably one uh distant camera that
shows the two of them so if you release
the the the distant shot without
edits we might feel comfortable you know
if the only edits are the camera angles
that's fine but if they don't release
the the one that's all the way through
I would be very suspicious very
suspicious all right
um my ongoing conversations on politics
with uh Michael Ian Black many of you
are watching watching the show continues
to get
fascinating it's just so interesting to
have somebody who's willing to engage
with the other point of view to the
point of actually listening to it and
you don't have to like his
opinions you know it's a big world
um but I do think you have to appreciate
that he is breaking the The Silo he's
letting in opinions from magga fully
fully looking at him and he's releasing
opinions that I can see that I've never
seen before it's stuff that in my own
Silo I I I think really are there more
people think like that because I never
see it so there's a tremendous Public
Service happening and
today um Michel lean black was pushing
back on some
comment somebody asked uh I guess he
said mag is demonizing people and or
somebody said it and the question was
asked of him on X who exactly is magot
demonizing and here's his
answer so he said uh off the top of my
head these would be the people that he
says the mega people are demonizing
immigrants Muslims LGBT community the
FBI the intelligence Community the
scientific Community the justice system
the electoral system uh a lot of elect
elected officials all G who don't agree
those would be the Rhinos uh all
Democrats and the
Press now here is my first
reaction
huh huh imagine if you were a
Democrat and you thought that magga was
demonizing all of those
groups how would you feel about
magga not too
good yeah if this were an accurate
statement of what's going on and that
would be I guess the message that
Democrats are getting that the
Republicans and mega are demonizing all
these groups so I tried to do my thing
which
is uh match his um transparency and his
willingness to say something that the
other side sees basically and so I
thought I would give some clarification
and I said Republicans call is setting
boundaries and I said uh gave some
examples I said the FBI it's good except
when they target Republicans you know in
an illegal way but it's not like meot
doesn't like
FBI Rank and file you know regular
workers uh or how about
immigrants as far as I know everybody in
mega likes legal
immigrants I've never heard anybody say
there should be zero
immigrants now there's always the
extreme people right so there's the you
know there's always the 2% tale that
says everything and anything but we're
not really talking about that if you
talk about just you know the the
majority of the mega so-called
people they're all pro-immigrant as long
as the Immigrant want to follow the law
and do it the the legal way how about
science I've never
met a conservative who didn't like
science we have specific
complaints you know I I caucus with the
with the Republicans in this sense
technically I'm a Democrat but um
science is
terrific over
time over time the scientific process
best we
have
but if you lie about the
pandemic don't you think we're allowed
to talk about that if if climate models
look like they're obvious
scams in my opinion you know independent
of whether there's actually any warming
or people are causing it the climate
models are really obvious scams I can't
say that I can't love science and
appreciate all it's done but also say
this little corner of it is weird I
can't say that uh String Theory hasn't
quite
delivered I can't say that you know it
got the food pyramid wrong I feel like
these are pretty valid so and then on
the lgbtq
thing uh I don't see demonizing I see
boundary
setting you do you but don't do it to my
kids it's just a boundary yeah you you
go live your life as long as we're both
obeying the laws just stay away from my
kids that's just a
boundary
now who's right which which of these two
narratives are right are is magga
demonizing all these groups or are they
just saying hey there got to have to be
boundaries if you have a in no boundary
world everything falls apart and every
expert would tell you that even if
you're raising children the boundaries
are not bad news the boundaries are what
make the child into a useful person the
boundaries are necessary for mental
health
and probably this is one of the reasons
that Republicans have far better mental
health because they think of the world
in terms of boundaries boundaries are
good for your mental health and they
allow you to build a system that has
been time tested stay in a jail go to
church you know I'm not recommending
this stuff I'm saying it's time tested
it's just time tested you know I'm not
personally a Believer but
Christianity is time
tested Christians turn out to be good
people in the United States in in the
modern world everything has a bad
history but in the modern world it works
so it's a boundary
and uh they have boundaries for
everything and it's a good system but
I'm going to surprise you by completely
agreeing with Michael Ian Black that
magga does in fact demonize immigrants
Muslims LGBT FBI they do they do
demonize them it's just that in their
minds they're thinking in terms of
boundaries what they say is definitely
demonizing
yeah I I'm going to have to agree with
him completely on this right I agree
completely there's a whole bunch of
demonizing going on way too much and
it's scary and if there's push back for
it well you deserved it honestly
right if you get a little bit too
demonizing and you're not clear with
your you know we're just talking about
boundaries then you deserve some push
back now everybody's different I'm not
saying you specifically or you know
doing anything wrong but there are
members of the excited Mega Community
who say things that even when I look at
them and I I probably agree with them
about almost everything but even when I
look at it I think I don't know I feel
like you're not being clear enough about
the boundary it looks like it's a little
bit too much about the people so I would
take this as a um positive feedback
but I hope it works both ways you know I
hope that
Michael can see that at least in
people's minds they're thinking in terms
of boundaries they're not really
thinking about demonizing let me give
you an example have you ever heard
anybody say anything bad about Rick
grenell because he's
gay
no nobody's demonizing Rick grenell he's
just a really effective you know public
servant had important jobs he gets
talked about for president all the time
right he's one of the names that comes
up as somebody who should be considered
for higher office I've never heard one
person ever demonize him for being gay
have you have any of
you yeah and it's it's the same with a
lot of them um who have you ever heard
of
uh a republican demonizing Elon Musk
because he was born in another country
no no that doesn't happen there there's
no demonizing of immigrants at least in
their minds so uh again I'd like to
thank Michael Ian Black for what is
really kind of impressive bravery for
even being willing to mix it up with the
other Silo of information just to find
out what happens and uh to me it's been
a productive and really eye openening
but if you don't use it to fix your own
game and you just think oh it's telling
you what's wrong with the other people
then you're missing the value the value
is how you fix your own your own team
that's the value so take his comments
seriously a little less demonizing would
go a long way or a little less looking
like you're demonizing right work on the
impression because it
matters all right um I'm getting a
little tired of the conversation about
who it's going to be because I think
that's
settled and unless Biden um gets way
worse really
fast I think it's pretty obvious where
things are going to go it's not going to
be Michelle Obama it's not going to be
Newsome because they they can't get rid
of the you know the Dei vice president
there's just no way to really do it no
matter how much they want to there's not
really a way to do it there's not enough
time she has the control of all the
campaign money it can't go to anywhere
else
and it's just obvious it's going to be
Kamala
now what's not obvious is if she's going
to be running from the top of the
ticket or the
bottom my prediction is that Biden will
stay in the race but that even the
Democrats will say I want you all of you
voters to understand you're voting for
comml
Harris Biden will be the head of the
ticket and if you like to vote for him
because you want to sort of reward him
for what you think is a good job vote
for Joe Biden but just know that you're
voting for KL Harris because he doesn't
plan to stay in the
job his his plan and his commitment
maybe he might even promise it you know
toward the end he might say look here's
the deal I think you're right I think I
lost a step but I guarantee
kamla Harris can do the job and I will
as soon as as soon as I'm sworn in we'll
just turn it over to kamla so you can
vote for me but just know you're voting
for kamla let's all be in the same page
I I my name will be on the top but
you're voting for k Harris I think
that's the play and the reason
is what else is it going to
be I don't think there's time to put her
in the top of the ticket and do all the
things they need to do and change change
all the collateral and the marketing and
reward everything and and then then
she's got to pick a vice president
right then you've got all the drama of
who she picks uh I saw that there was
some thought that if she were at the top
of the ticket she would Pi pick Whitmer
or Buddha jedge or something else but
what was not considered was were any
white men or any men straight men there
were no straight men considered for vice
president's
slot how would you feel about
that if you were a straight man who is a
Democrat because they're not really
hiding
it when when Republicans pick you know a
Mike Pence or a straight straight white
male they're not saying these are the
only people who can be president no
nobody thinks it well an Colter maybe
but it it's not a it's not a republican
thing they think who's the best for the
job and then it's not their fault that
there are a whole bunch of people who
have had experience who look
white and if Tim Scott were just maybe a
little bit
stronger or uh you know Dr
Carson they're
absolutely acceptable choices
there there's no the Republican party is
absolutely going to take the best
choice if Republicans had a a uh
Obama level person you know somebody who
was that good
politically it did it wouldn't matter
what who it was it wouldn't matter how
gay they were it wouldn't matter how
black they were how female they were
none of it would matter to the
Republicans and they would get over it
immediately like they they would you
know the the 2% would whine and then
they would just get over it but the
Democrats are really serious about this
Dei stuff and there is no way it's going
to be anybody but kamla whether she's
running from the second or first
position it's just going to be her and
there's no way she can pick Gavin
Newsome as her number two it's just not
an option now if you're in a party that
won't accept you
in the in the party you're
in are you going to
stay it would be crazy it would be
insane to vote Democrat when you know
they're going to discriminate against
you and by the way if they had a choice
between a uh if the Democrats had two
good candidates and one was a black man
and the other was a black
woman you know that the black man
doesn't have a chance right
you all know
that I would even go so far as to say I
think within the Democrat Party although
they would not say this I think they
would pick a white woman over a black
man because it's a female party and I
think they want a woman way more than
they want um a second black
president they want their first woman
president way more than they want their
first second black president
so it's a they have a hierarchy it's
like a it's like the Indian cast system
right the the white men the straight
white men are The
Untouchables then you got the the brahin
whoever's at the top that would be the
the the
women of all types but just
women
anyway uh van Jones says the Democrats
are discussing how to replace Biden not
whether and I think the how is going to
come down to not replacing him but that
is one way to replace him so the how
would be just talk about him not really
being the head of the ticket and then
nothing changes you don't have to do any
paperwork so given the choice of doing a
no paperwork don't lose any money don't
stir up a new controversy don't have to
worry about who the new vice president
is not having a blood bath in the
convention um nobody's polling better
than in comma has a replacement if
satisfies Dei satisfies time and it
satisfies
money let's stop talking
about anybody but KL Harris it's so
blindingly screamingly
obvious that I don't
know I don't know what to say about it
it's fun to talk about but it's going to
be
com one way or the other so she's the
schinger candidate you don't know if
you're getting the Dead one uh Biden or
the living one
kamla uh however using the Elon Musk
Theory which uh which is my theory as
well that the funniest path is most
likely what's the funniest
path the funniest path if you had to
think of all the things they could do
what's the
funniest the funniest is leaving Biden
in the race and then saying you're not
really voting for him
that's the funniest because it's the
dumbest it's the most lame and pathetic
it's the one that most shows the lie
that that the Democrats are not even a
little bit invested in giving you a good
candidate it's not even something they
care about so that would be the funniest
and that also supports why it's probably
going to happen all right CNN poll says
Harris runs closer to Trump than even
Biden according to the
hill um
how would you like to be comml Harris
and know that your
polling is just slightly better than a
guy with no
brain if you're ever compared to
somebody who clearly doesn't have a
functioning
brain and you only best them by
2% do you feel good about that well
there's a good news Scott you took the
SATs at the same time as a guy in a coma
um and I'll be like well how' I do good
good you you beat the guy in the coma
and I'd be like thank God you only beat
him by
2% what yeah the guy in the coma you
beat him no question about it you beat
him
2% I don't go I don't go home feeling
good about that I
don't Biden 2024
oh Biden in
quotes I'm seeing the sign Biden in
quotes it took me a minute that's pretty
funny all right
um let's see sha Davis who's a great
follow on X very provocative and he's
he's sort of uh definitely in his uh
best for talking about the current
events at the moment and here's a
warning he gives he says everyone needs
to remember this Democrats are not just
going to give up
power they are in way too deep and that
they they know they're in massive legal
trouble when Trump takes over this is an
existential battle for many of them
which means that nothing is off the
table
yep yeah
now a lot of people are being hyperbolic
about you know there's going to be
revolution in the streets no matter what
happens and all that and certainly
they're going to be protest no matter
what happens but I don't know how
Democrats who know they would go to
jail would not be in favor
of radical actions to prevent
it and you are talking about people who
are literally
Killers people who have ordered people
to be killed that that's what a
government is so there's no shortage of
people who will be in the Dem rat you
know Inner Circle toward the top who
have literally ordered people to be
killed Obama has ordered people to be
killed right it's a thing they they have
killed people so to imagine that they
would be squeamish about killing Trump
who many of them believe is Hitler is a
little
naive they absolutely would be willing
to kill
him I guarantee that somewhere in the
government they're talking about it
at least floating the idea well
hypothetically if we were going to do
such a thing you could hypothetically do
it this way now I don't think it's like
an operational
plan
but I do think that they have to
consider it because their options are
the end of their lives meaning some of
them really need to go to jail for 20
years I've got a list of my own but I
feel like I don't want to demonize
anybody if you have a list of people
that you think should go to jail when
Trump takes office keep it to yourself
you're not
helping and and I and and I'd like to
think all of you are on the same page
nobody goes to jail unless you really
got the goods can we agree on that and
no Democrats go to jail unless it's
really clear they broke some serious
laws right we all good at that I know
you want your revenge for them law
faring Trump but you're not going to win
by turning into them don't turn into
them make sure that if you ever talk
about you know Trump might pursue
somebody just make sure you throw in
there it's got to be within the realm of
the law and by the way that's what Trump
should say when they say but you said
you want to get
revenge Trump should
say which is a revenge and anything
beyond that has to be within the strict
letter of the law because we've seen the
law get stretched to the point of
ridiculous where they chased after me
I'm not in favor of anything like that
shouldn't happen to any American
democrat or republican but if there are
any examples of grotesque laws being
broken I think you'd all agree nobody's
Above the
Law so there's a way to say it where
people don't argue and they go yeah I
guess you have to and there's a way to
say it that sounds like you're going to
lock up all the the the chattering hosts
on
MSNBC so don't say it the way it's not
going to happen which is nobody no
Republicans are going to be in favor of
locking up Joy
Reid can I can I say that as clearly as
possible Joy Reed Rachel mow if you're
listening there's no Republican who's
going to put up with with you being
jailed for your free
speech they don't do that there would be
zero support for that and there would be
so much people so many people would be
on your side who are Republicans that
you'd be safe right that the thing that
Democrats also don't seem to understand
is Republicans do police themselves when
the Constitution is involved would you
agree that you know neither side is
perfect everybody's got their thing you
wish were different but I my observation
is that when the Constitution is
involved Republicans say nope nope I I
love you but you just violated the
Constitution nope that that's a hard no
so Democrats don't understand that the
thing that would stop Trump is
Republicans because apparently they
don't have
that because if they don't have
standards see they don't this is that um
this is that boundaries thing again the
boundaries that
Republicans uh apply to everybody else
as in I don't care how gay you are but
could you you know give me a heads up if
you're telling my kids
something that's just a boundary but but
they put the same boundaries on each
other do what Republican would be okay
with Trump violating the
Constitution none none who would be okay
with Trump getting revenge on his uh
enemies using lawfare
alone none I don't know anybody would be
in favor of that now again when I say
none you know I have to be uh I'll give
a wink to uh Michael Ian Black again it
never means none because there's always
some crazies in The Fringe but you don't
have to worry about them right they're
they're not important so when I say none
I mean effectively none for all
practical purposes it' be like it zero
so the people who have boundaries always
have boundaries and it applies to the
thing that scares
you too there's no exception no nobody's
going to be okay with a trump or anybody
else violating the Constitution there
there's there's no Republican impulse
for that there's only impulse for who
hold on that's too far boundaries
there's a Russian prankster who
allegedly called Hillary and said they
had some dirt they could use on Trump
and allegedly Hillary said go ahead you
he's a bad
person but I would just remind you that
in the age of AI when somebody says I've
got this audio tape of a famous person
doing a sketchy
thing you got to
wait I mean if I had to bet on it it
looked looks
true but I would definitely not trust an
audio recording that included a public
figure saying something
sketchy and by the way she didn't say
anything sketchy so that's the best
indication it's real you remember I told
you that in reality things are always
never perfect you know the the the way
that you can tell something's fake is
it's too on the nose If This Were fake
they would have done a better job of
making it
provocative if it were fake it would
have been something like Hillary saying
if you don't take him out I'll have to
kill him myself you know just crazy
so if it doesn't have that stuff in it
it's probably not fake what she did say
was actually something that doesn't
bother me at all she said Trump's a bad
person if you dig up some dirt
grap is that a problem
is it problem just because they're
Russian because she didn't say she
didn't say I want to collude with you
she was simply acknowledging what they
said and if something bad happened to
Trump because they had some information
that was real I suppose then she'd be
okay with
that technically I guess that would be
colluding if it were if it were a
republican they'd say it's colluding but
I don't have a problem with it at all so
that makes it it looks real just because
it's not that provoc
ative well speaking of provocative tuer
Carlson has lined up a meeting with
zinski now things are getting
interesting why do you think zalinski
now would talk to Tucker Tucker is the
most anti- Ukraine funding person with a
high profile you can think of why would
he want to give Tucker more energy
because he knows Tucker is going to say
are you a lying stealing Coke sniffing
weasel who's stealing all our
money he will and zinsky must know that
why would he do
this I can think of one good reason he
expects Trump to
win I think this is another Fallout from
the debate remember Trump said he
thought he could am I imagining this
didn't Trump say he thought he could end
the wars before he got uh he took the
oath you once he got elected but before
he takes the oath
I think maybe he could and I think
zalinsky knows that he needs to start
sucking up to Trump's supporters
prominent ones or he doesn't have a
chance and Tucker Carlson would be the
alpha predator of Republican leaning you
know opinion let's say uh I don't think
he I don't know if Tucker is Republican
or independent or what but he would be
the the apex predator within that ecos
system
now here's the interesting
part I've never seen a tease for an
interview that had the legitimate
potential to end a
war now I'm not going to predict
it but it's within the realm of
possibility that this would go the way
the debate went not in terms of somebody
being mentally graded but in terms of
something that shocked the
world um so I definitely am going to
recommend that you watch it when it when
it happens they haven't talked yet but
there's no way that Tucker is going to
go easy on them he's not going to go
easy on him so it might be the first
time zilinsky has really
been interviewed like a real
interview and Tucker is smart
enough to know that if he asks the right
questions he's going to end the
war I've never seen anything like this
if he asks the right
questions he can end the war just think
about that now I'm not going to predict
it I'm not going to say he's going to do
it but it is totally within the realm of
it's reasonable actually it's not even
extreme or
unlikely it's I'd say it's close to a
25% chance that Tucker can embarrass
zalinski enough in public that he can't
he can't wage the
war it might actually just take him out
of the war footing it it could just
reveal the mess of it now let me give
you some examples now I'm just going to
make up some stuff to you know try to
make the point we've sent you X billions
of
dollars uh there are reports that X
billions of been
stolen can you tell me that it hasn't
been and he can't he he might say oh
yeah we take care of everything then you
say but is there some kind of auditing
or accounting system why is it that in
the United States we think that you
can't you're telling us we can but what
system is doing that
auditing now once zinsky completely
fails to say that he's a good steward
with our money and he will
fail and I'm pretty sure that Tucker
will make sure you know he
failed that's it there's no war without
money and all all you need to stop the
money is some person to ask the most
obvious questions that uh the people who
are giving the money should be asking
just ask the obvious questions can you
make sure it's being used can you tell
us it's going to be good for the United
States and how
I think he I think Tucker
has he's going to do to zalinsky what
Trump did to Joe Biden I think he's
going to reveal him for who he is and
it's going to be
brutal maybe the other possibility is
they just have a nice
chat
so 75% chance no news is made that
really matters of course it'll be
newsworthy um and 25% that Tucker
Carlson will individually and personally
end one of the biggest Wars in
Europe now I know that's a lot of
pressure to put on Tucker but it's
totally within the realm and by the way
I could probably do
it I'm I'm a
hypnotist if zilinsky ever agreed to no
I couldn't because of the language now I
wouldn't be able to hypnotize zilinsky
because of the language difference you
can't do it through a
translator all right
um there's a funny video of a police
officer pulling over a vehicle for a
going the wrong way on a oneway street
uh except it turns out to be one of
these wh Mo driverless uh cars I think
it's one of the driverless taxis and the
cop walks up to it and the video is
running and and the window goes down and
the car talks to him I don't know if he
was talking to somebody back in the back
office uh or if the car's AI was talking
to the police officer but he actually
pulled over a driverless car to give it
a ticket and had a interaction with
it it was
wild absolutely
wild all
right it's uh the 4th of July and we
don't need to spend too much time doing
this even though it's the best thing
you've ever done today we are going to
do a
uh simultaneous ending sip uh before I
go talk privately to the locals people
so all of you on uh every
platform how about we uh give a toast to
the uh I'm going to say the toast to the
citizens of the United
States the citizens of the United States
we're not too happy with our government
at the moment
so we don't have to celebrate them in
fact it would feel icky at the moment
but we certainly would like to celebrate
each
other those people who choose to be here
um whether they came here and became
Americans which I love by the way I love
somebody who chooses to be an American
and then you know does all the right
stuff and does it legally that to me
that's like that's just the highest
level of being of an American in my
opinion because if you want to do it by
choice
that feels like better than just being
born into it and putting up with it by
choice so to them and also to the rest
of you to
Americans as imperfect as we may
be all right ladies and gentlemen uh
that's enough for me for x and Rumble
and
um YouTube and I'll see you tomorrow
same place and I'm going to talk to the
locals people privately in a
moment
