well everybody you know what time it is
you probably do yeah it's time for
coffee with scott adams
and can life get any better than this
i doubt it i doubt it this is
incredible and if you'd like to make it
even a little bit better all you need is
a cup of margarita glass of tango
chelsea stein canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better you know it does it's
called the simultaneous set but it'll be
enjoyed around the world
at the same time that's what the
simultaneous part means
go
that's the good stuff so if you had
some kind of a bedding service
and you could place a bet what are the
odds
that scott would ever be in the national
news story
about monica lewinsky
well that happened uh so turns out that
my tweet in response to a monica
lewinsky tweet
put me in the news fox fox news and some
other places
carried it what are the odds
i mean really now
i i told this story on locals the
subscription service where i tell
all my my naughty stories and and the
stuff that i don't want to put here
but i think i could tell you this story
think about the following coincidences
number one
i'm in a national news story about
monica lewinsky
number two i once shook hands with bill
clinton
so i've actually touched the hand that
touched monica lewinsky
now probably a lot of people shake hands
with
presidents but i met him once after a
speech
so i gave a warm-up speech for bill
clinton and i was just on the
the dais do you call it and he went down
and shook
everybody's hands said hi
uh you might also know that i once
visited the oval office
to chat with president trump
and when i was there ivanka was waiting
for the president to come in and
she had shown me into the oval office
and she was showing me some of the
decoration
choices and i may be misremembering this
but
uh it could be just because it's too
perfect
you know sometimes you remember things
that you want to remember even if they
didn't happen
but i would swear that ivanka told me
that the carpet
was bill clinton's carpet because i
guess each president gets to
choose from a warehouse of stuff which
things from prior presidents and prior
administrations they want in the oval
office
so i think bill clinton's rug was in
there
now i couldn't really check i didn't
bring a black light or a
csi team to find out if it really was
bill clinton's rug but
i have a memory of it either real or
false
and so there was that but an even
weirder coincidence
do you remember the story of linda tripp
she was the one who
convinced monica i think to go public
but linda tripp
got her advice from a literary agent
named goldberg now what are the odds
that i would know that literary agent
but i did she i believe she's deceased
but she was married to an executive in
my cartoon syndication company
so i've actually eaten a meal with the
woman who broke the
the monica lewinsky story
i also know jake tapper
you may know that jake is also a very
skilled cartoonist
he has a very deep italian stack it
turns out and he's done he's been a
guest cartoonist for the dilbert comic
on
two separate weeks in two different
years and
jake tapper once dated monica lewinsky
you know before she was famous so
one of the odds that i would have so
many connections
to a small cluster of presidential blow
jobs
we must be living in a simulation there
couldn't be
that many connections by
coincidence could there well
yes there could but it's fun to think
about it
so here's some more news stories i have
a prediction about the ufos
number one i don't think they're real so
i'm still
solidly on the side that says there's
nothing up there
just nothing now i would love to be
wrong
if there's anything i would like to be
wrong about
it's aliens i would love to be wrong
about that
but i'm going to stick with my belief
that it's a psychological phenomenon
along with a number of maybe visual or
optical oddities
some of them might be fake some of them
might be false memories
who knows but
what if there are real ships
here's my prediction if they're real
meaning that there's actually a physical
something
they're from the ocean here's why
we have not explored the ocean so
something could be hiding there forever
suppose there were alien uh
as the conspiracy theorists say alien
astronauts who helped
i don't know build the pyramids or
helped with early civilization
you know beating off the the animals
so that humans could be the dominant
species
maybe they've always been here or
they've been here for
a billion years maybe they just live
under water
because it would be safer if you live
under water
no hurricanes no sunburns no animals
trying to eat you
you know if you have the technology to
do it now uh
you played an alien scott how can you
not believe well it's true i have played
an alien on television
now could it be atlantis or at least
could atlantis be based on
something like that well we don't know
we do know that there was a video of a
ufo that appeared to be going into the
water
we know there are stories of ufos
emerging from the water
without leaving much of a ripple so
now some people saw my tweet on this
topic and said
but scott how could they forge any
metals without fire
no i don't mean that they live literally
in the water
i said under the water meaning
in some kind of a contained area that
may or may not have
oxygen because who knows if they need it
uh
but i'm sure that they can figure out a
way to you know if they can live under
the ocean
undetected for millennia i feel like
they could make metal
right so uh and mark says what about
propulsion
there seems to be no sign of propulsion
well sticks and hammer did a
a comment on my tweet this morning that
says it might be some kind of uh
electromagnetic force being
meaning if the rocket ship knows how to
interact with the earth's
magnetic force it might be a maglev
situation is that possible
i don't know but
if we're talking about stuff we don't
understand
well you can throw in some more stuff we
don't understand the propulsion
uh in a fitting move the us army shut
down
the comments section uh or at least they
blocked the comments on
their woke youtube videos
trying to get recruitment now you may
have seen the video there's one of them
in which a woman talks about her two
moms
and how she joined the military
and it's all very female oriented
and very very woke and very uh
what would you say very uh
i don't know very open-minded i guess
and
we like all of those things um i like
being open-minded i
i like not discriminating i like having
everybody having equal opportunity
but
apparently this doesn't look like it's a
dangerous enough to scare our enemies
because it looks a little soft
as ted cruz noted in his own tweet he
said
that the army is turning our fighting
people
into pansies was his word
now how did he not get canceled for that
i'm trying to figure out how does ted
cruz
still have a job after using that word
pansies because isn't that
where where's the lgbtq people saying
hey you can't say that
now in my opinion
he didn't mean anything about being gay
he was just saying it's just a
colloquial word for
not being you know tough and dangerous i
guess
but i'm kind of surprised he didn't get
attacked for that or maybe he did and i
haven't seen it but it's not any kind of
a national story
kind of surprising i don't know why but
apparently that didn't go over so well
for the army uh so they're gonna stop
that now here's a counterpoint
counterpoint is this i think it was uh
uh balaji srinivasan who said this on
tweet
that the future of warfare is probably
drones
do you need to be 200 pounds of fighting
muscle
to operate a drone probably not
so is there any reason to believe that
our army wouldn't be
90 female in the future if they're
operating drones
why not you don't have to carry heavy
things because basically carrying heavy
things is what it comes down to right
suppose the military comes up with
better ways to
carry heavy things they got the robot
dog
carrying the heavy stuff so you don't
have to whatever
but i would not assume that
there would be any degradation of
readiness based on
women in the military and if you think
so
you might be thinking of the old
military where you had to pick up a big
old heavy sword
but modern military it's entirely
feasible that
we just don't need men for i don't know
in the future
50 of the jobs maybe you just don't need
men
all right um
i heard some bad news and then some get
good news i tweeted them both
i'm hoping the good news cancels the bad
news the bad news is that the
telehealth executive orders
that trump did during the pandemic that
said you could do
video doctoring across state lines
without
any special licenses or fees apparently
they have timers on them
meaning that each state will revert back
to the old way
when a date is hit which i believe those
dates are being hit
what the hell what was the point
of doing this very smart thing to fix
this obvious problem
and then have it revert back to the
problem well the good news that i found
out later
jonah shoemate filled me in that there
are two bills at least two bills
percolating
to fix this and then make it permanent
to allow telehealth across state lines
the good news is they're bipartisan so
at least one of them
that i saw is a bipartisan bill we've
got a democrat the republican backing
him
so i feel as if the incompetence which i
worried about
may not have to be a problem so
there might be a couple of politicians
who are just fixing a problem
thank you so if you do that thank you
you know what's weird about my job lots
of things
but one of them is i get quoted a lot
meaning if you go to one of the famous
quote
sites there are lots of them chances are
you will see
a bunch of quotes from me and every now
and then i'll see a quote
that's attributed to me and i'll say to
myself
really did i say that i don't remember
saying that
or in some cases they might be quotes
from someone else
that got attributed to me but there is
one that i feel
is very appropriate to 2021
and to a problem that a lot of us are
suffering from
and i'll i'm going to develop this as we
go so wait for the big point
to be developed but here's the quote
that apparently i said at some point
i i don't deny it but maybe somebody
said it before i did
maybe i copied it i don't know but the
point is this
everybody is somebody else's weirdo
everybody is someone else's weirdo
do you ever feel to yourself man i am so
weird
if anybody found out how weird i am
i'd be in trouble because man i'm so
weird
well i would like to introduce to you
the basket case theory something i
developed when i was a young man
to explain what i was witnessing and it
goes like this
if you meet a stranger it could be
somebody you want to date
or just somebody work with maybe just a
friend
when you meet them don't they seem
pretty complete
have their act together pretty well man
that's stranger
i wish i could be like that stranger
because the stranger doesn't have
anything weird about them
and they've got their act together and
on the inside
pretty confident and pretty capable
and then time goes by
and you learn more about your date
or your friend or your co-worker and
suddenly
there's a flaw oh i didn't see that on
day one but
there does seem to be a flaw maybe a
little weirdness
day 10 well looks like there's more than
one flaw
two years later well i guess everybody's
 up
that's the best case theory everybody
looks good
until you get to know them once you get
to know a human being
they're always basket cases always
just different kinds of baskets as soon
as you realize
that every person is a basket
case
you're free you're free
what is it that bothers you more than
anything as long as you
you're healthy and you know you have a
job what bothers you more than
anything is what people think of you or
what you think they think of you
or what they might think of you or how
they would treat you if you did this
embarrassing thing
they're not better than you basket case
theory
they're not better than you they're just
people you don't know that well
that's it there's nothing else to the
story
you just don't know them that well if
you did
you wouldn't be impressed i'll tell you
one of the
one of the most common things that
people say to me
as a celebrity type when they get to
know me
they say some version of gosh you're
just like a regular person
well why why wouldn't i be there's
nobody who's not a regular person except
maybe michael jackson wasn't
you know if if you get famous when
you're too young you can be
kind of weird but even michael jackson
was he weirder than me
probably not just different weirdness
was he weirder than
you probably not
just different weirdness and so
um there's there's something connecting
this
weirdness and self-esteem issue
with a massive problem we're having in
the country right now
massive problem loneliness
the loneliness problem is now
the epidemic you know the virus is
we're doing a good job on that so you
know great job
country and world working on that but
people are so
freaking lonely and it's not entirely
because they're not with people
because they are they are with people
how many of you in the comments are
having a
crisis of loneliness right now
in the comments tell me how many of you
are feeling lonely
in a way that you've never felt before
like just
you know a whole new level of loneliness
look at the comments now
now you'll see some no's and that's good
but look how many say yes
right i'm thankful that there are any
no's there at all
maybe half of them are no's something
like that
but if and then somebody says all my
life yeah
and because of the loneliness
i think you're also seeing more
addiction
right one way to make the pain go away
is some kind of addiction and
how many of you watch this live stream
because it makes you feel less lonely
in the comments answer that question for
me do you watch this
live stream in large part
because it makes you feel less lonely
now i'll tell you that
you know i have people in my house so
i'm not like
physically alone but i've started to
watch
i guess what you would call pov or point
of view
video mostly on youtube in which i want
somebody's face looking into the camera
like i am right now
and talking to you as if i'm talking to
one person
you can find lots of youtube videos
where somebody's explaining something
i can't watch interviews anymore because
if i watch an interview i'm watching two
people talk to each other
and i'm not part of it but if i watch
one person
talking to me uh i could probably even
watch one of those makeup videos
you know which are huge because it's
just somebody putting on their makeup
and just talking to you i would totally
watch that
it has nothing to do with the makeup and
i think there's something happening
that's bigger than what we understand
because clearly the pandemic made us
more lonely
right so there's an obvious thing going
on there but there's something
else going on because there's a second
epidemic
and i think it's connected two epidemics
that are interacting with each other and
none of them have to do with the virus
directly so one is the loneliness
and the other is narcissism i believe
narcissism has gone from
something that people had and you could
stay away from them
to something closer to an epidemic and i
think social media has done that
so what i've learned about this
narcissism thing is i used to think it
was people who thought they were great
and if that's where you think that that
if that's what you think it means
then you have to catch up just like i
did it's not about people thinking
they're great
that's just like a little bit of it
right it's about people who have broken
self-esteem just completely broken
and the way that they deal with their
broken self-esteem
is by belittling other people one-upping
them
bragging putting them down shutting them
down
thwarting them in any way you can now
i used to look at those people because
they're everywhere
but man are there more of them there
are right and i think it's because
people who might have been
sort of on the border of being that way
just got pushed over the edge by social
media
imagine living in a world where
everybody is criticizing everybody for
everything
that's our world we live in a world
where everybody's criticizing everybody
for
everything imagine that
how would you like to be a teenager and
be criticized on
everything the shirt you wore that one
day
the the embarrassing thing you did just
once
but somebody saw it the uh
you know you're not as pretty or as
handsome or as strong or good as sports
as this other person
it's got to be devastating devastating
yeah and it's and there's just more of
it because it's in your face
and you're seeing these impossible
images of people who
you want to be like but you're not etc
so there's somebody out here watching
this right now
you might be watching it live or
something might be showing it to you
but i'm kind of talking to you talking
to you directly
you're feeling super lonely you might be
addicted
and you're trying to figure out a way
out and you're thinking
what the hell do i do i'm trapped i'm
lonely
um and maybe addicted and i have low
self-esteem
and all these people who are doing
better than me are beating up on me and
they're controlling me with their with
their their
their opinions are actually just
breaking my brain i can't stop thinking
about what they said about me
is that you yeah that is you
and i'm going to give you um at least a
few tricks
this will just be a start it's not going
to fix anybody instantly
but i'll give you a few tricks for
escaping that
okay some brain hacks some life hacks
it goes like this number one
always remember the basket case theory
the person who's talking to you and is
insulting you
they're broken did you say to yourself
oh my goodness somebody who's normal
is criticizing me do you know how many
times that's happened
how many times has a person who's got it
together and they're normal
and they're criticizing you how many
times has that ever happened
do you think a lot because the answer is
zero
it's never happened nobody who has their
act together
is criticizing you in cruel ways but you
are getting criticized in cruel ways
you're being judged
not by good people you're being judged
by
thoroughly broken people who are acting
out
they're taking out their pain on you
if you imagine that they're complete
somehow good
people well that feels pretty bad
because you don't want somebody that you
respect or at least think is normal
to be judging you that feels terrible
they don't exist they don't exist
that thing that somebody said well it
was sad
the words exist but there's no such
thing
as an unbroken person saying that kind
of stuff
they are just completely broken
and you should have pity on them
and your first thought should be empathy
not feeling bad so that's your first
trick
remember the basket case theory nobody's
nobody's good
it just doesn't exist and trust me the
older you get
the more people you meet the more you'll
know this is true
there are no complete people just broken
people and they're the ones
the more broken they are the more
they're going to come after you
because they need that they need to push
you down so that they can feel good for
today
so that's trick one everybody's broken
number two
low self-esteem is like a virus
you catch it from other people
you didn't get your low self-esteem
necessarily
because you were born with it i mean
there's got to be a genetic
component here but mostly it comes from
narcissists
who have their own broken self-esteem
and they want you to have a broken
self-esteem and if you don't have it
they're going to give it to you
you catch it from other people and you
can get rid of it just like you can get
rid of the freaking coronavirus
right you do have a constitution
you do have immunity but it takes a
little while just like any cold
you know the cold winds for a while and
then your natural immunity takes over
your natural immunity can get you away
from this
low self-esteem that you caught from
other people
it's not in you it's something you
caught
and you're going to beat the out of
it
just like your immune system will beat
the out of the coronavirus
for 99 of you plus number two
be good at a few things that you can
control
there's nothing better for your
self-esteem than knowing that
if you work hard on something whatever
it is
that you can become one of the good ones
not the best in the world but better
than other people
and the things that you can control the
most are
diet fashion choices
haircut
fitness you can control the out of
those things
if you're not good at fashion find
somebody who is get some advice
don't know how to exercise find somebody
who can
have them tell you how don't know how to
eat right find somebody who knows
have them tell you how my book catfilled
almost everything and still win big
would give you a leg up on developing
your own system to do those things
find some things that you can completely
control
and control the out of them just
control the out of them
because that's where you get your
self-esteem
because if you look at um
i'm actually a really good example for
this and i'm going to say something
astonishingly uh lacking humility
but the the point is to help you here
for a moment
um i'm i'm a person who's good at a lot
of things
a lot of things it was a pretty long
list i actually made a list the other
day
because i was wondering what would be on
the list
so if you made a list of things that the
press
has called me and asked for my expert
opinion on
you'd be kind of surprised it's across
economics business
humor politics
but how many things are there
that you could be good at like that what
are what are the
all of the things that humans can do
it's gigantic
right it's like millions of things
that people can do and i'm good at
almost zero like if you took all of my
skills
and compared it to all the skills that
anybody could have in the world
it rounds to zero it doesn't round even
to one percent
it's it's just zero and
i'm an example of somebody who has
pretty high skills in a variety of
fields and it still rounds to zero but
it still makes me feel good
that there are a few things i could do
well and that's why i concentrate on
fitness and diet and you know in the
case of a guy
if you get your fitness and diet right
and keep your hair short you're probably
pretty good
fashion wise so
control the things you can control get
good at them
and remember that nobody's good at much
nobody nobody zero people
are good at much take tiger woods
is he good at driving right
tiger woods most skilled golfer of all
time
can't drive a car can't keep his
wife
can't keep his dick in his pants right
there's no such thing
as complete good people they just don't
exist
right you could become president and
have all the flaws in the world have you
ever heard of any
presidents who had any character flaws
have you heard of that all of them
all of them every one of them no
exceptions all right
here's some more use your despair
to find freedom use your
sadness loneliness
depression and despair
to buy your freedom do you know how to
do that
and by the way freedom feels really good
here's how
do you remember that day you were lonely
and uh sad and neurotic and anxious and
depressed
and every other bad feeling in the world
and if only you could talk to that
that guy or that girl that the person of
your affection
if you feel like you're gonna die anyway
just do it you're free
go up to that person that you think is
going to turn you down
and guess what they probably will
doesn't matter
it doesn't matter everybody's failing
all over the world all the time
go up to that person and say to yourself
before you walk up
my whole life is garbage right now
i'm sad i'm lonely i'm neurotic
let's mix it up a little bit let's shake
the box
let's just let's just see what happens
leave your box walk directly up to that
person that is
way better than you in your your broken
mind
they're not way better than you but you
think they are and say
you know i just wondered if you'd like
to go out to dinner with me i think it'd
be fun
what happens well let me tell you a
story
that happened just like that i'm divert
gonna
divert a little bit years ago when i was
single i lived in san francisco
had no social life whatsoever no game
the i wasn't it was before online dating
i mean meeting somebody was really
really hard
pre-internet and i joined a group called
the spinsters
well i didn't join them i went to an
event that they had spencers were young
women
who were single and they had an ironic
name this is spencer's
and they would have these big parties in
san francisco and other places i think
and they would invite men and it was
just basically a way to meet people
so i went to one of these events with my
friend josh
and we walked in and we looked around
and we said to ourselves
not exactly the most attractive room
i don't want to be unkind but it wasn't
exactly what we were hoping for
with one exception across the room there
was one
unusually attractive woman um
and she sort of stood out as you know
the most attractive
woman in the entire place and so i said
to my friend
well this is a this is a disaster i mean
basically
i'm i'm paraphrasing but yeah we wasted
a night
i'm just going to go over to the most
attractive woman in the room
and you know i'll flame out in about a
second and a half
and then we'll be done and we just go
home
so i walked directly up to the most
attractive woman in the room
and she was my girlfriend for 11 months
now if you would ask me what were my
odds
i would have said pretty close to zero
pretty close to zero
and it turns out that other people were
intimidated and didn't talk to her
i heard this problem that cher had a
problem that men were intimidated
you know years ago and so she had a
trouble getting a date
they were just intimidated now why was i
able to walk up
to someone that i could normally not
walk up to is because i'd given up
i had absolutely given up there was
nothing for me here
i just said well doesn't matter and i
don't know her
if she turns me down nothing lost
the moment you realize that your despair
is your freedom you're free
have you heard the phrase freedom's just
another word for
nothing left to lose you've heard that
right
it's a famous song freedom's just
another word
for nothing left to lose how about that
college class you were going to sign up
for
how about that sport you wanted to get
involved in how about that motorcycle
you wanted
too dangerous right you're free
every one of you who is depressed and
anxious
you're free because nothing you do will
be worse than the way you feel right now
nothing do something do something
dangerous not dangerous physically the
motorcycle might be a bad
recommendation do something
psychologically dangerous
take a chance put yourself out there
flame out get killed
you know just just get smashed
just go do it you're free you're free
all right if you want to meet people
here's the best way to do it you have to
join uh
activities there is no other way
to meet people and and form lasting
friendships
hear this clearly there's no other way
to do it
you have to join an activity a club
a sport a gym an organization
a political movement nothing else
right you can't just make a friend
like good luck you could try
but i don't think i've ever seen it work
hi uh you know
bob uh hearing good things about you i
think we could be friends
it doesn't work do something
join a thing make a sport form a club of
your own
why would you not form a club of your
own because you're afraid nobody would
come right
what's the difference you're as good as
dead
you're depressed you're anxious you hate
your life you're thinking about putting
a
i can't say that here but you're
thinking about
maybe life isn't worth it i won't say
more than that
you're free you're absolutely free
go have some fun now i gotta tell you
i've used this technique
a number of times and man does it work
it really works you're free just
remember the people criticizing you are
narcissists
they are broken get yourself some
friends it will help most of your
problems
most of your problems are you don't have
good friends
most of your problems go get some
activities get some friends
all right in this same uh same vein
and i've got a few more minutes here um
when we're
i saw a tweet on this and i just like to
amplify it
we're going to spend a lot of time
criticizing our leaders
for the pandemic response i just feel
like we need some humility about that
because i just don't think it was
reasonable to imagine
all of our leaders were going to guess
right because they didn't have data
there was a lot of guessing so
you know let's let's give them a break
you know
we do have to be you know rough
about looking at what went wrong i mean
you just have to do that
but uh i think in terms of the people
you can still say they made a mistake
but i think the people were good
right you i was just going to say cuomo
say what you will about governor cuomo
he didn't want anybody to die
he worked really hard he's smart he's
well-meaning
did he make a mistake well that's you
know he argues no
you know their extenuated circumstances
you would say
but i don't feel like we need to to have
an answer to that
because the answer i want is did the
leader take it seriously did he
did he work all day and all night was it
you know was he capable or she
yes did he care yes
did he make a horrible mistake maybe
maybe but i don't think you can hate him
for that
you could hate the outcome um there's a
funny movement going on to
make democrats accept their own thinking
and it goes like this that if you're a
company or a college
that doesn't have enough diversity and
you're a
white member of that uh group
let's say you're a white person who's a
professor at harvard
i'll just pick that now let's say you
thought that harvard did not have enough
diversity
in the teachers you should quit
if you take it seriously then
equity that the quit
and equity is the important part
if you don't take it seriously and
you're going to keep your
nice white person job at the top of the
heap
and you're complaining about other
people who should do more at the bottom
to make things more equal well you
 you right if you've got a nice job
and you're complaining about the lack of
diversity
quit your job and and help a
black or brown person get your job if
you're serious about it
if you're not serious about it shut the
 up we don't care
all right so put the quit in equity
and let's hold the uh the rich white
people to
their to their own philosophy
we're not asking them to do anything
that isn't consistent
with their own beliefs that's all we ask
just
follow your own beliefs and we will
respect you for that
glenn greenwald had a i feel like i
mentioned glenn greenwald
every day and it's worth it
every day if you if you want to follow
one really good twitter account follow
green uh glenn greenwald it's just like
a
a global treasure at this point so he
was talking about fact-checking uh
politifact i guess
had fact checked the idea that the
virus could have escaped from the lab
they called it a debunked conspiracy
theory
so they used to call it a debunked
conspiracy theory
but now they say uh that you know
qualified people say it's at least
something we need to look into so
politifact changed their fact from total
debunked conspiracy theory to
oh yeah all the smart people are saying
this that it might be true
that it escaped from the lab and glenn
points out accurately the fact checking
i'll just read his words because he says
it so well he goes fact checking like
virtually everything the corporate media
does
to feign superiority is a total scam
just another way for them to smuggle
their own ideologically driven
disinformation and conspiracy theories
under a more
elevated facade i love that
turn of words an elevated facade
like that's that's some good writing
right there
like i you can you can write for a long
time
without coming up with a phrase under a
more elevated
facade that's just good right anyway
um you see this all the time
so the way to make your fake news look
legitimate is to have a fake
fact-checking organization telling
telling people it's legitimate it's like
the greatest scam
you know if people are not trusting you
form an organization of people who say
you're good
now rasmussen uh weighed in on social
media
to point out that it's very similar uh
rasmussen tweets
this sounds eerily like the digital
pollsters rating and grading schemes
fame superiority and prowess coupled
with smug and atrocious in-house
election forecasting
so rasmussen points out that while
rasmussen
is unusually accurate compared to most
pollsters
they get the most abuse from other
pollsters because the other pollsters
don't want you to think that they're bad
and rasmussen is more accurate
so watch out for your fake poles and
your fake fat chicken
it's going to be a lot of it have you
noticed on
amazon if you're a book author or if
you've read reviews
have you noticed that there will always
be this kind of review
and it goes goes like this i really like
the author of this book for some other
thing
but this book everything is wrong about
it
because he gets all the wrong answers
and he's not the one who's qualified to
talk about this thing
but i sure am and so i as the reviewer
will tell you how much better i could
have written this book and
how the sections i didn't like really
should have been edited
downton if only it could have been
written more along
the great thinking that is common to
people like me
and less like the bad thinking from this
author
have you seen those every book review
you know or every every book gets some
of those
and those are narcissists those are
people who are broken
and they're they're finding every avenue
they can to assert some superiority
so they write a review give you a one
star that tells you
you know if i had written this book i
would have done a better job
it has nothing to do with reviewing the
book it's about a narcissist
who is broken flailing out and trying to
fix the pain they're in
because they can't understand why this
author is getting money and fame
when they're getting none of that and
they're so much smarter so much smarter
than all these authors when they're
best-selling books
so i used to be bothered by it
but only recently have i come to
understand that these are just broken
people
no more different than a street person
who you know throws a
throws a rock at you i mean you don't
like the rock
but you look at the straight person then
you should have more empathy or pity
than anger
uh haters gonna hate
yes but i think the hate comes from a
specific place it comes from a broken
self-esteem
and it is my hypothesis that there are
more people with
broken self-esteems because of social
media
than at any time in history and that all
of these broken people
are flailing out at everybody else until
we're all broken
it's basically self-esteem as a virus
it's a freaking virus the broken people
are breaking as many people as they can
touch
because it makes them feel better so
there's your there's your advice
criticism is just a flag that says i'm
broken
right now there's such a thing as valid
criticism but you know when you see it
right
somebody says you know uh here's another
way you could have done this it would
have been faster
well that's okay or you know that's not
that's not the hat i would have worn
this other one would go with your outfit
maybe that's being helpful but you can
tell the narcissists they're just
broken don't let it break you
you've got some techniques now and i
think
you're going to be a lot better when
it's over go get yourself some friends
and you'll find your mental health
problems
feel a lot better go get involved in
something
join a group form a group be the boss
make your own group that is your advice
for the day
and i'll talk to you
