for the best time of the day
every single day no exceptions
and if you came here to watch coffee
with scott adams congratulations
part of your day is going perfectly
because you nailed it
here you are and everything's working
now if you'd like to make it special all
you need is a tanker cellos or stein
no wait let's read from the top i'm
going to use a copper marker glass a
tanker tells you to stein the canteen
chunk of plastic vessel of any kind
you think i'd have that memorized by now
but that's not how my brain works
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better
everything it's called the simultaneous
sip and watch it happen now
go
let's see huh
having a little technical difficulty on
one side here but i think it's solved
all right my favorite
fake news of the day and this is a good
one
do you remember the of course you do the
famous
laurel and yani where some people could
hear the word laurel
and some people could hear the word
ianni on the same recording
and we thought to ourselves how is that
possible and it must be like
a trick that only applies to this one
weird set of sounds that they can sound
the same while being different
it turns out it's really easy to
reproduce
this effect and it happened with a joe
biden
video so somebody cleverly
uh took his video where he was talking
to the press
and reportedly he's saying what must be
what
asking for a clarification of a question
that he didn't hear because the
helicopter noise was above it
now when you watch it can you hear him
say
over the the noise of the crowd and the
helicopters
what must be what no you can't
because with the first time you heard it
you were probably primed by the social
media
video to hear my butt's been wiped
so you see you see biden walking up to
the
photographers and the reporters and he
goes
my bum my butt just got wiped my bod
just got wiped
and you really can't hear anything else
after you've been primed even after i
heard what the white house
claims he really said it doesn't look
like that
it doesn't sound like it and i just
watched it over and over again
and i'm thinking nope even his lips are
not working
going in the right way right even his
lips didn't seem to match up with
what must be what it looked like
my butt's been wiped now i think that he
did not say
my butt's been wiped but how many times
are we going to see this trick
this trick is going to happen a lot in
politics as soon as you've been primed
all you need is an indistinct sentence
any kind of indistinct sentence and you
can prime it with anything
you're going to see a lot more of this
and it's kind of fun
all right is there one topic
that you're so damn sick of
not only in the real world but talking
about it
my god do we have to talk about masks
again yeah we do
we do we're going to try to take an
angle into this that's a little more
interesting than the normal one
and so the cdc is now saying that the
delta variant is
raging through the country which it is
and that uh they want
school kids to get uh to wear masks
even if vaccinated they need say even
vaccinated people should wear masks
indoors if they're in a
higher substantial transmission area and
of course they want vaccinations as much
as they can get
now how do you interpret this
is your interpretation that the cdc
looked at the data
they looked at the mask effectiveness
data and they said to themselves this is
a good time to apply the science
let's put some science on this this baby
and we got our new data we've got data
on mask effectiveness
oh the the infections are rising masks
work
boom put them together is that what
happened it sounds right
doesn't it you know when i describe it
that way it sounds perfectly natural
infections are up science has shown that
the basques do work
according to science that's their claims
not mine
and so you put them together
or or
what would be another interpretation of
why the cdc
is requiring masks
because my first instinct was wait
you're punishing the people who did the
right thing
i got the vaccination which is the right
thing according to
my government and so if i did the right
thing why have i be
being punished well of course it's
because we have new data that says
that even if you're vaccinated you can
you can
transmit the virus you could even get
the virus
which of course you'd have to get to
transmit and
so it's new data so that's what's
happening right
let me suggest that there's another
reason before the mass command mandate
anybody
anybody in the comments see if you can
beat me to it
what's the other reason for the mask
mandate
that they're not telling you
let's see if
let's see if you can get that what's the
real reason
all right the real reason i think
is to create one more reason to get a
vaccination
now you're saying to yourself but wait
that's opposite of what's happening
because the people who did get
vaccinated didn't get the benefit that
they thought they would get at least in
terms of
freedom from masks
so isn't that the opposite scott like
you're you're actually just penalizing
people for getting vaccinated they got
vaccinated
and then they still have to wear a mask
a penalty
i don't think so i think this is a psyop
i think this is so that the government
could say
well we told you all to get vaccinated
did you listen because if you had
listened to us the first time
nobody would need a mask but sorry
we know you hate the masks we know you
hate it more than you hate anything
so we're going to require the masks
because you didn't listen to us the
first time
i think that's what's happening
now i also think masks work
can you handle the fact that i think
masks work
at the same time that i don't think that
a vaccination the vaccinated person
should be forced to wear one can you
handle that
i mean you this is the the smart group
here the people who follow me on live
stream
so so there are not many people in my
category most people say i don't like
masks
because they don't work
but can i say they do work
i think you know that's my judgment at
the moment that they do work
but if you're vaccinated you shouldn't
get one
i think i can have that opinion all
right
um we're going to talk about the worst
arguments for mass in a minute but let
me do a few other things here
so i read just in one source so i'd like
to see a confirmation of this
that the cdc is going to replace its pcr
test
the the virus test with one that can
differentiate between the coronavirus
and the seasonal flu
is that true first of all anytime i see
a story in one source
it doesn't matter what the source is my
first thing is
uh why is this not in all the other
sources at the same time
so if it's true we're gonna learn
something interesting
and i'm gonna go with my uh my personal
uh conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy
theory
that i don't know if there's more than
one or two people in the world who share
it with me
and it is that the regular seasonal flu
didn't really kill anybody
and that it was just a statistical um
i don't know a statistical data
gathering
artifact that made it look like the flu
was killing people the regular flu
the normal seasonal flu i think that if
we had actual data
we would find that sure you know a few
hundred year olds
die with the seasonal flu but basically
it doesn't kill anybody for all
practical purposes
all right that's what i think we're
going to find let's talk about simone
biles
so she dropped out of the olympics she
had some more uh
competitions that she would have done
well in if she had not dropped down
and she dropped out because she says she
had a tough day yesterday i guess
or the day before and
she said she was having a mental health
issues
and so she was dropping out for her
mental health
what did america say about their
champion who dropped out because she
wasn't feeling well
well a lot of people said uh
you know you're representing the country
right you
you do get that this isn't about you
right
and maybe if it's tough you should just
suck it up
i heard a lot of that opinion this
morning that's not my opinion
my opinion is i think i saw dave reboy
if i'm pronouncing his name right say
the same thing i'm going to say right
now which is
we don't know what's going on in her
head we don't know
we only know what she told us you don't
know what's happening in her head
if what's happening in her head is
really really bad
then she made the right decision if it's
not that bad
well then it would you know you could
argue that she should have sucked it up
or something
but you don't know how bad it is so how
can you have an opinion on whether she
did the right thing
that's just pure mind reading if it was
horrible
and it was just some living hell and she
was generally confu
concerned about her health that she
might hurt herself competing in that way
or at least embarrass herself and
embarrass the country
if that was her honest opinion based on
her internal mental state
who am i who am i to doubt that now of
course i have a larger filter on the
olympics which is the olympics are
useless
uh anachronistic probably more bad than
good at this point
and then it ruins the lives of young
people such as simone biles
although she had a you know great life
from her skills so far
she uh she now has that thing about the
olympics where her life will never be
the same because of this
so the olympics you train your whole
life for it
you don't get the gold medal it's sort
of a waste of time
yeah so i don't think the olympics
should be
respected that's my view
well well well there's new news on
ivermectin what do you think
if i told you that there's a new highly
credible
something called the cochrane review on
ivermectin where they looked at the
existing studies so it's not a
it's not a new randomized controlled
trial
which would be great if there were it's
again
somebody looking at the existing
evidence
and you know that people have looked at
the existing evidence say oh it's really
strong
the existing evidence is very clearly
says you should at least take a try on
the ivermectin
uh and you've heard brett weinstein say
that famously
you may also know that andres backhouse
my favorite critic
of all things data and analysis um
said at the time that he wasn't
convinced that he thought one of the
one of the larger trials that was in the
review the better review of all the
trials
they're one of the ones that probably
influenced the average the most because
it was a big one was
weak so there might be one week study
that's
biasing the whole thing and the cochrane
view
i think agreed with that and said that
the quality of the evidence is so low
that they essentially say
that there's no evidence that ivermectin
works
so the newest respected
meta-analysis says that there were two
bad quality studies that were skewing it
and that we don't have evidence that it
works
now let me be clear they did not say
the evidence shows it doesn't work they
didn't say that
so they haven't debunked it they've only
debunked that the evidence shows it does
work
because apparently the range of
possibility and the
given the low quality of the evidence
the range of
you know error is so big it might work
and it might not
they're just saying there's no evidence
that it works now that's what
andres becko said early on so if you're
keeping score of who gets things right
early there you go
so i don't have an opinion on
you know any of this analysis because
it's all a little bit beyond me
and i haven't looked into it of course
in any detail
but um
somebody says brett dealt with this by
removing that study and this still works
well now there's two two studies
so i don't know if he removed the second
one but the second one has the same
problem
allegedly and that this cochrane review
says that
if you take if you consider the quality
of studies and everything else
combined their opinion is there's no
evidence that it works or doesn't work
really just no evidence all right
i saw a great uh tweet thread that i
retweeted and you should read it too
on the question of masked mandates
as from trisha greenhalgh i
howl i'm not sure how to pronounce her
last name but she's a professor of
primary care
oxford and does a great job of just
laying out what we know and what we
don't know
and most not most
maybe 100 of all the arguments i've ever
had about masks
are with people who uh are not well
informed
or that or they have a logic problem and
i'm going to run through that
because i want to see if you're in any
of these categories that are
logic errors as opposed to data errors
now we could argue all day about who has
the right data and sometimes we'll just
never know
but you can really know if somebody's
logical right
that's something you can know for sure
because logic is pretty clear
if you've got somebody who can help you
sort through it so i'm going to do that
for you
and i'm going to start with the most
debunked
mask arguments so what follows
is my opinion of what the consensus of
science
says all right so there's two things
that could be wrong here
one is is my opinion of what science
said right
and that is science right right so two
ways i could be wrong
one is i could be wrong and then also
science could be wrong
so you've got two two potential errors
right
so i'm gonna keep my humility while i
say this because i know people get
really mad when i
when i act arrogantly certain
i have to tell you that lots of times
when i appear
certain you know there's always a
recording in my head
that plays and says well you could be
wrong and by the way i recommend that
as a strategy for for you going forward
just always have a little recording that
plays in your head that says
well but i could be wrong i mean i'm
pretty sure
but i can be wrong it's just a good
thing to have playing in your head all
the time
all right so here are the debunked
anti-mask
arguments if you hold one of these
arguments to be true
just know that science disagrees with
you as as best i can determine
but i might be wrong number one science
says
masks don't work how many people think
that's true
how many people think that if you
researched what science
says that you would discover the science
in general
not just one study or a study here there
but how many of you think that
science says mass don't work
okay if you think that science that says
mass don't work
that's just wrong that's just wrong you
won't find any actual scientist who says
that
you might find a scientist who says that
they don't work
but you won't even find a scientist who
could agree with the statement
that other scientists don't think they
work
so the worst argument you can make is to
say that science says they don't work
and it's been proven in the study that's
just not true
as far as i can tell now that doesn't
mean science is right
okay so we're still allowing the science
can say mass
definitely work but science could be
wrong
science has been wrong before all right
but
don't confuse that with what science
says science is very clear that they
work
even if they're wrong all right how
about this mask only make a tiny
difference
well the tweet thread i referenced talks
about how these tiny differences
multiply
so even if mass only made a tiny
difference
still totally worthwhile in a pandemic
the math makes that true so if
if that was your argument that's been
debunked again
doesn't mean you're wrong it just means
it's been debunked by people who know
more than you and i know
all right how about uh the masks harm
people either because you're not getting
enough
oxygen or you're breathing in your own
germs too much or
you left your nasty mask you know laying
in a drawer for three weeks
breathing germs and put it back on so
how about that
well there's no evidence that masks have
hurt anybody
so now we've got you know people all
over the world wearing masks for a year
and no evidence at all according to at
least
this professor in oxford um
there's no evidence that the mass has
hurt anybody so if your argument was
wearing the mask itself could hurt you
no evidence okay now again
is that true i don't know
i'm just telling you it's been debunked
doesn't mean the debunk is true
how about uh this argument that uh masks
don't block viruses
because viruses are too small and they
can't go through these
uh the viruses are so small that they
easily go through these gigantic
holes in the masks debunked
totally debunked because the virus
travels on water particles
most of the water power or at least a
lot of the big ones
are trapped in the mast that's why your
mask is moist when you take it off
yes some gets out by the sides but
if you're stopping that hose cannon of
virus going directly into the person
you're talking
talking to it's better than having
something go out the side and
diffuse into the atmosphere so the
argument about masks
leak around the edges is true but
irrelevant
okay it's true that masks leak
it's not relevant it's true that viruses
are way smaller than the holes in the
masks
it's not relevant because they travel on
water particles
many of which do get stopped and you
don't have to stop them all
masks do not stop all of the virus
because plenty is getting out the sides
and
let's say you're fussing with it and you
know you wear it improperly
that's not an argument
because science has shown the mass work
if shy if science had shown that mass
don't work
in other words the population shows no
difference mast or unmasked
if they'd shown that then you could say
to yourself well probably the reasons
are because the masses are not stopping
all the virus
but if the masks work
and science knows that let's say the
right for argument
then you don't have to argue about the
little stuff you don't have to argue
about the people messing with
it with their their hands wearing it
improperly it's not the best mask
because it gets out the side
none of that matters if you've looked at
the whole population
and they drove down infections with
masks but all the places that they
didn't have mass it didn't work
now you can argue with the data but if
you accept
the masks worked to lower infections
then all of the arguments about the
holes in the mass and the size of the
virus and the
sides and all that is irrelevant
so if you made your argument against
mass based on any of the
minor parts about the leakage the size
of the mass
the the fuss and with them the wearing
them right none of those are relevant
if this is a big if
if it's true that science is right
that we see the big difference when
people wear the masks
okay so you would not be rational or
logical
to consider the smaller things if we've
tested the big thing
that it worked all right
here are some of the worst arguments
i've saw this morning
here's one the mayo clinic tells you how
to properly wear a mask
therefore masks don't work because
people will not wear them properly
so the argument is why would the mayo
clinic make such a big deal about how to
wear them properly
unless they knew that people would wear
them improperly in a large amount
and therefore would make them a waste of
time
that's the worst argument i've ever
heard because again
if the data shows that they do work on
average for any population that uses
them
it just doesn't matter if somebody or
some number of people are not doing it
right
because it still works the numbers show
it
and here's another bad thinking
i have links of studies from before the
pandemic
saying masks don't work
what what good is your data from before
the pandemic
if the data from the pandemic
clearly shows they work and again
they could be wrong but that's what
science says
if it clearly shows it does work during
the pandemic
why are you trying to convince me with
links from before the pandemic so
showing the masks don't work when it's
been proven they do
i don't know i suppose you could say
that studies of masks
uh it might be hard to sort out what is
the social distancing
because that works too i don't know but
i'm guessing they probably figured out
i'll just sort that out of there
all right so here's my final take on
masks for today
um i'm i'm an anti-massacre for people
who are vaccinated
in my opinion if you've been vaccinated
you know what your risks are
very very low and if you're unvaccinated
you also know what your risks are or
should
i mean it's on you if you don't know it
at this point and
what about freedom what about freedom
if you don't want to wear a mask i'm
fine with that
vaccinated or not now of course you have
the problem of
keeping the hospitals from being overrun
but i'm going to make an assumption
that needs to be checked which is that
our therapeutics are so good
now and we've you know there's a
learning curve about how to handle covet
etc
that probably the odds of getting
overrun in our
hospitals is probably low in the united
states
can somebody do a give me a fact check
on that if
if in fact that's fact checkable um i'm
going to say that we've done so well
with therapeutics that
we won't overrun the hospitals with or
without masks it just won't make any
difference
i mean there will be a difference in
level but it won't overrun the hospitals
and uh oh our hospital is current
currently overrun
eliminating overnight surgeries and they
say it's from covet
interesting i don't know where that is
derek in what uh
some seeing hospitals in new jersey are
fine
you know i don't know if the hospitals
are overrun
has to do with the fact that some
hospitals are specializing in covind
could it be that only the specialized
ones are over on
or the ones that have a focus on that
now or is that not a thing
all right so this is an open question we
do see that there might be some hospital
problems and i think the degree of the
hospitals
being overrun would definitely have an
impact on on my opinion
but i don't need i don't have a
confirmation on that uh boston hospitals
are fine
could be more obese people in some
places yeah
uh does anyone know anyone with kovid
right now i do
yes i have a family member with covid
not my house extended family member
all right best friend got
it yeah so some of you do all right
there's a rasmussen poll coming up today
uh that's going to show biden at a
record low
of presidential approval now record low
you know just means it's lower than
what's been it doesn't mean it's
you know in the toilet but uh
i don't know that seems like it seems
about right
because covent is what completely
took trump out don't you think
cove had imagined trump running for
reelection without the coronavirus
i think he would have just waltzed into
a second term
would most of you agree with that that
without the corona virus he would have
just
trump definitely would have got a second
term i think so
um but i wonder if biden will have the
same problem
which is if he puts in mass mandates and
does a bunch of things that people don't
like
that even his own party will get turned
off and we might see
maybe seeing the beginning of that a
little bit i mean i don't think more
than five percent of the public ever
changes their mind on
presidents but we might we might be
seeing our you know
sub five percent to change and it might
get to that
all right here's a question for all of
you
uh oh it might be because of china
you're right yeah biden has a china
problem
um and how have we gone so long without
a hunter biden scandal blowing up into
some larger thing
it's really amazing what the what the uh
deep state and the and the news can keep
out of the news
anyway all right new question
uh this is a question for all of you i
want to see your answers in the polls
for those of you who got the
vaccination is it my imagination
that the coronavirus vaccination
was unusually unpainful
meaning i i barely knew what happened i
was literally
i didn't know that they gave me the shot
did anybody have that same
experience and somebody speculated that
the needle is smaller
or that um it's a small
it's a micro needle and
oh that's a good word a micro needle
now of course we had side effects after
in many cases
but um i'm not talking about after the
shot
somebody says mind hurt badly i'm
talking about the actual
shot itself as it goes into your arm i
couldn't even feel it
and and what i what i did feel was like
not even a pinch really it was just a
feeling
yeah now i wonder if people who are
afraid of needles
and since i'm not afraid of needles i
can't really get in the heads of people
who are
i don't like them but i'm not afraid of
them
i wonder if people would be more
inclined to get the vaccination
if they knew that the vaccinations are
unusually unpainful
in terms of the vaccination itself how
many of you
let's see if for those of you who might
be afraid of needles
would you be persuaded by the fact that
if you were looking away
you just don't see it you wouldn't even
know what happened i mean barely
they'd have to tell you what happened
would anybody be persuaded by that
oh i'm seeing some yeses oh my goodness
i'm actually a little surprised i didn't
know if that was actually part of the
psychology
so you're so some of the psychology
about fear of needles
has to do with the needle itself and how
it and how it feels
the pain would reduce the anxiety
all right and i'll go one level further
if you heard that the vaccination won't
hurt when you get it
just the point of vaccination because
they were using a micro
needle instead of a regular needle
now i don't know what a micro needle is
i don't even know if that's a thing i'm
just making up a word right i saw
somebody say it in the comments
but if somebody said oh this isn't a
regular needle
for the vaccination they they use a
micro needle and you don't feel it
wouldn't that change your psychology of
it
they don't use a regular needle they use
a micro needle and you can barely feel
it
now remember everybody has a different
trigger for persuasion so if i said
something you know might be persuasive
but 90 of you would be unpersuaded by it
it's still a good idea if you could
persuade 10
of people on anything just any topic if
you could move 10
of the people that's gigantic persuasion
you know that's really big so uh
replying it's a regular needle
somebody says it's a regular needle uh
and whoever says it it says i administer
the vaccine
is it the same size as the needle you
use to draw blood because when i think
of needles
the needle i see most often in my adult
life
is when i'm just getting a blood test
for one thing or another
and they they put that blood drawing
needle in you and it
kind of hurts it's kind of scary
yeah i think the blood drawing needle is
probably a thicker needle
and they've got to find the right place
to put it and all that
so so i guess calling it a
micro needle doesn't help but
i have to believe there is it because
they don't
have to find a vein maybe that's it
so the blood drawing needle is larger
which makes sense
so i got a feeling that people people
think of that blood drawing needle when
they think of the vaccination
uh micro micro needles are patches that
makes sense
blood cells blood donating needles are
bigger
okay so there is such a thing as
larger and smaller needles well i don't
know about
uh okay here capcat is saying something
i was looking for is intramuscular
suppose you knew that they didn't have
to find a vein it's intramuscular so you
won't feel it at all
all right i was just testing that out so
that's about all that's going on
today is there any topic i missed today
if there is all i'll jump into it hey
dean
um so there are a variety of needle
sizes
well anyway uh the way persuasion works
is that you get a hypothesis of what
might persuade people and then you just
try it
you see what reaction you got and if it
works you do more of it and if it
doesn't work you try something else
so in a b testing i think
the government if the government wants
to persuade people to get
vaccinated they should put a little bit
of effort into finding out if describing
the actual needle
situation gets you a little bit more
compliance
and again if you don't want to get a
vaccination that's okay with me
all right um oh talk about larry elder
it looks like larry elder is shooting to
the top of the pack
for a possible replacement for gavin
newsom
in the recall election and i i have to
admit i haven't done a
any kind of a deep dive on larry elder
but uh everything i know about him just
from observing him on tv for
years etc is he's a really good
communicator
and he seems to be very commonsensical
meaning that he doesn't buy into crazy
stuff
so i don't know if that makes a good
governor
but i know that what we're doing now is
not optimal
so i feel like he could win
and i feel like maybe it's time to try
something else
so oh ed buck i guess ed buck got uh
prosecuted uh
democrat fundraiser uh
was doing some bad things with some some
men in his home
uh but that story isn't very interesting
that's just a criminal story
all right um
yeah the end buck story has lots of you
know
lots of intrigue and drama and stuff in
it but ultimately it's not important to
us
except that a buck is adam schiff's
friend
all right oh somebody says alex berenson
was banned on twitter
can somebody confirm that did that
happen today
now when i did my uh
what happened we have determined you
have violated oh it looks like alex
berenson was
banned on twitter literally suspended i
think he's suspended for 12 hours it
looks like
so all right
uh that's about all we got for now we're
still waiting for the
are we still waiting for the arizona
audit
can somebody tell me what happened to
the arizona audit
weren't we supposed to know about that
by now and
i'm i'm gonna go i'm gonna double down
or triple down on my prediction
that if you haven't heard something from
the arizona audit yet
that's just absolutely damning
i don't know that they have anything it
feels like it would be deeply unlikely
that the audit would have you know proof
of fraud
and that you wouldn't know it by now
really
it wouldn't leak a little bit i noticed
there's some
leaks that come out but they they get
debunked as soon as they do
airports are shut down what
i don't know what you're talking about
airports are shut down
china force mandatory testing
all right this comment keeps going by
too quickly and i can't read it
airports are shut down and for uh
yellow quarantine okay yeah you can stop
putting that in the comments because it
keeps going by too fast for me to read
it
all right uh they said no release of
information until the final
yeah but this is the real world
in the real world if they had the goods
you would know it by now like if if i'm
wrong about that
that would be shocking and i could be
remember i got that recording in the
back of my head but i could be wrong
you know it could be the the first time
somebody has
you know world-changing news and lots of
people are involved
and they're mostly amateurs or you know
people just working on this project
and they don't tell anybody
maybe you know maybe
but i doubt it so if that's what's
happening
that'll be the biggest surprise in the
world i've got a feeling that what's
let me make a prediction what's going to
come out of the arizona audit
ambiguity if you had to bet
on a clear result in the future on any
topic
versus an ambiguous result in the future
where people are going to interpret it
as two different movies
always bet on the two movies in 2021
anyway maybe it was different in the
past
but the odds are that the the audit will
create
what the people who already thought
there was fraud
will consider proof and the people who
say there was no fraud will consider
debunked you know that's coming
right you know that what's coming
is two movies one that proves the
the election was fake and one that
proves it wasn't
they're both going to be playing at the
same time in a month i guarantee it
i guarantee that whatever the arizona
order says
it will form two complete movies that
will live forever does anybody disagree
with that by the way
by now you all know that's true right
you've all seen the
cycle repeat so many times was there
russia
russian collusion in the 2016 election
two movies will live forever
why do you keep saying china isn't
affected by
covet well relative to how much the rest
of the world is affected
um if you have other information let me
know
but i haven't seen it all right gene
i agree this is boring and that's why
i'm going to help you
by re hiding you on this channel
goodbye all right that's all um
oh fox news is saying that arizona audit
finds massive fraud
turn on cnn cnn will say
stories of massive fraud all debunked
doesn't mean it's true
but you know they're both going to
happen
uh did you see anomalies debate with
sticks and hammer 666
i didn't when did that happen
if that's on video i'd watch that for
sure
i keep telling you nine million citizens
of
nanjing mandatory testing yeah but you
know
that it doesn't even come close to
the size of the problem you would expect
from that being ground zero
so yeah nine million people with
mandatory testing
means they're taking it seriously but it
doesn't mean they have the same level of
problem with other people
all right wish steve crowder well
somebody says what's happening with
steve crowder
all right uh the sticks debate is on bit
shoot stixx killed him
i'll be they did
i i saw a little bit of their exchange
on twitter so i would imagine that
all right um
so china in china you can't leave home
without a red yellow or green card
mandatory quarantine centers yeah but
with all of that
with all of that they're nowhere near
where you would expect them
just commonsensically in the pandemic
there there is still a giant mystery
of what's going on over there
um what crowder is having complications
in a collapsed lung from what
do you have an accident of some kind all
right i'll
catch up on that all right that's all
for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
