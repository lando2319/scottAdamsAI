well good morning everybody
amazing amazing start of the day
it turns out
that you woke up today thinking well
today might be a good day it might be a
bad day but surprise it's an amazing day
because you made it here to the
simultaneous sip
and some of you are prepared some of you
are scurrying now to grab your cup and
your beverage but while you're doing
that let me give you the introduction
the thing that makes it every everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip a
copper mug or glass that's all you need
a tanker chance to stein a canteen jug
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
the thing that connects us across space
and time it's called the simultaneous
sip and it's going to take your
antibodies to a whole new level watch
this
go
antibodies
well i know you don't like anecdotal
evidence you like data you like hard
data
but
let me give you some hard data
nobody
has ever died of covid
while taking the simultaneous sip you
can fact check me on that
zero people out of 7.8 billion people on
this earth
not a single one of them has died of
covid
while doing the simultaneous step
nothing not a single one
do you think that's coincidence or
causation
clearly causation clearly because we
know how to analyze things well in the
news elon musk
his personal net worth
is now more than exxon mobil
his personal net worth
no not the value of tesla
tesla is already you know much more
valuable than
uh apparently more valuable than exxon
mobil
but elon musk himself
he's worth
289 billion dollars
and by the way at his current age
he should be the first trillionaire
elon musk will be our first trillionaire
pretty sure i mean the odds are really
good
um and he surpassed the value of exxon
mobil
which is only 272 billion
did you know that exxon mobil was only
272 billion i mean i realize a billion
is a lot of money
but i thought they'd be bigger
actually i was a little surprised i
guess i should have known
well dave chappelle addressed the uh
issue with the trans community in the
the dust up he's having with his netflix
special
and he had this uh
quite clever thing to say
he said that the
the trans employees and they'll be
gqt employees at netsafe
they say what they want is a safe
working environment
a safe working environment
don't we all
don't we all and don't we want that for
everyone of course we all want a safe
working environment that's a good thing
to ask for
and we certainly want it for the trans
community
but
as dave chappelle cleverly points out
he's the only one who can't safely go to
work at netflix
now he doesn't exactly work for netflix
anymore
at least he's not doing any more
specials that we know of
but
literally he's the only person who isn't
safe at work
that's a pretty good comment
but i'd like to i'd like to add on to it
because i think it was a good social
commentary
but if i could extend it a little bit
um dave chappelle might in fact not be
terribly safe if he worked at
uh netflix because of the anger with the
trans and lgbtq community i guess
but
if i as a white man worked for netflix
but let's not make it about netflix
let's just make it generic a fortune 500
company
who would do better at the fortune 500
company
let's say equal amount of talent and
experience
dave chappelle
or me which one of us would
do better in their career
equal talent and equal experience
not even close
right
and who would do better than dave
chappelle
who who might do even better than dave
chappelle at a fortune 500 company
maybe a trans employee because they
there might be more pressure
because it's a smaller community and
it's harder to find candidates just
because of the smaller pool
i would guess that if a
highly qualified black employee
was up for a promotion against a highly
let's say equally qualified
trans employee in a fortune 500 company
who wins
same same qualifications
i think trans wins and i think dave's
right about that dave chappelle
you know you didn't say that directly
but but i feel that's the implication
so
we have this weird situation
where the only people who can get
promoted and you know have a safe
experience so the ones complaining
this is not to say they don't have valid
complaints okay so make sure you make
sure you hear this correctly everybody's
got valid complaints
the the trans people have tons of valid
complaints
they're valid
right you might not agree with them but
they're valid complaints you might
disagree about what to do about it
but we all have valid complaints and so
let's uh let's remember that
you know
you're you're not alone if somebody's
treating you poorly
right
if there's one thing that we we should
all be able to band together and agree
on
is that we're all victims of
am i right
like if you could
if you had let's say you had you were
an omnipotent being and you could
fix the earth and the racial strife
let's say you
you you had all the power that you could
somehow do whatever it took
to fix racial division how would you do
it
would you create a melting pot
the united states model and throw
everybody together
or would you segregate people and say
hey
one way to get rid of all this division
is just divide people
you know let them live with each other
i don't know i don't think either of
those will work here's what i would do
you ready here's my solution to racial
division
separate the
in all the groups
just put all the together so
you take all the black people who are
also
and you separate them out from the group
of black people who are awesome
then you take all the
irish people who are
you separate them out and you keep the
irish people who are not
you put them together with the the black
americans who are not
how did they do
really well
they're really well right they wouldn't
have a problem at all
nothing to do with racism
everything to do with who's an
and who's not an right
so we're completely framing the problem
wrong
if you took the out of the
category of white people
and granted it's a pretty big pretty big
percentage but if you could take the
 out of the average
would white people look so bad
no
no we'd look pretty good if you take the
 out
and likewise
do you think you could get along with
somebody from whatever community just
pick a community lgbtq
you know women men
black white asian american whatever
whatever you want pick any group and
then remove the from the group
how do you like them
they're great
they're great
you just remove the
now the the fact that we've been fooled
into thinking we have a race problem
think about it think about any
any other ethnic group
and then think of somebody you know
personally who just happens to not be an
do you like them
yeah
would you hire them
yeah
would you date him
probably yeah i mean that's a slightly
different question but probably
so
we're all looking at the wrong the wrong
question here really we're just looking
at the wrong question
all right
kudos to the biden administration yeah i
know weird huh i'm gonna give credit to
the biden administration for something
now it's conditional
because i'm not sure this isn't a trick
i don't know that this will lead to
something good but it's a good start
and here's the setup
apparently the biden administration is
expecting to name kim wyman
a republican
to a high position
so biden is going to put a republican
in a high position in uh
in the homeland security
so remember biden said you would be
you try to
unite the country be a little more
bipartisan
now the one he picked happens to
it's not a coincidence of course
was went hard at trump for his what cnn
calls his false claims
of fraud in the election so it's a
republican who has criticized
republicans
now yeah i know what you're saying
you're everybody's typing rhino rhino
rhino not a real republican i get it i
get it can we stipulate
just so you'll stop typing rhino in the
comments and type something else can we
stipulate
that a republican who's criticizing
other republicans you have a name for
them
you don't have to just keep printing it
over and over again in the comments just
print anything else just stop saying
rhino
i will stipulate that you have that
opinion okay
okay can we stipulate so we don't have
to just keep saying it over and over
i get it you don't like rhinos
i get it stipulated
but
who is more likely
to criticize both republicans and
democrats do you think a rhino doesn't
doesn't criticize democrats
of course they do the rhino is going to
criticize democrats but also republicans
i know you don't like that
and in some cases you say oh they don't
have the right views
man you do not like people who go
against your team do you
the the republicans out here are just
going freaking nuts
let me finish my point and see what you
think okay
now if your choice was to
put a pure democrat in the job would
that be better or worse
than picking a rhino
let me know
better or worse
what's better or worse
the same somebody says the same you
think that a rhino wouldn't uh would not
criticize a democrat
what would stop a rhino from criticizing
a democrat
nothing right
i i think i think biden actually picked
the one kind of person
who's definitely not a republican
in the classic way
by someone who has a pretty good chance
of at least
understanding the argument
on two sides
i think that's a that's a reasonable
step and but anyway this person will be
in charge of protecting future elections
so being a resource to the states
to help them uh prevent being hacked
specifically
so their her job is to keep foreign
interference out of the elections and
she would be a resource to the states
now
is that good
all right
i'm a little disappointed in you
honestly
i'm a little disappointed in the
audience
i have to admit
i can't hide it
if you don't understand the point that a
rhino would criticize both sides
and you really think that a rhino is
really just a democrat
i mean maybe i mean that could apply to
somebody i guess but i don't think
that's
i don't think that's keen insight
i think you should be able to agree with
me that a rhino could criticize both
sides
can i get that
okay can i get that the that a rhino
would criticize both sides
just that yeah you could say you don't
like it for other reasons but just that
right all right so some of you agree
with it and others others say no
i think some of you think of rhino as
somebody who's trying to destroy the
republican party is that what you think
do you think a rhino is somebody who's
trying to destroy the party
because i don't see that
i see somebody who likes them just wants
them to be a little different than they
are
all right
so i think that whole rhino thing is
just sort of a
it's sort of a weird
stimulant that just causes people to go
nuts
oh you know what it is maybe it's the uh
the uncanny valley that if somebody's
exactly like a republican and you're a
republican you say yeah right on that's
exactly what i expected but if
somebody's like a republican but not
quite
you know there i know thing
well they're like one but not quite does
it cause revulsion
like the uncanny valley if you've never
heard of a phrase
the phrase uncanny valley
just google it separately it's kind of
cool concept to know it's about how
robots become grotesque when they get
close to looking exactly like people
but not quite exactly they're just close
to exact and they become disgusting like
zombies
you know they just ugh you see one you
see somebody who's almost a person
you're like what the hell's wrong
maybe that's what it is with the rhinos
they're like they're almost republicans
but
what is wrong with them
it might be something like that
anyway
i'm going to
re withhold my criticism because if the
job of this
uh rhino you call her
is to protect foreign elections or
elections from foreign interference is
there any way to do that without knowing
that you can
also fully audit the election
so here's my stand
anything short of an explicit
effort to make all elections instantly
auditable so you can track your vote
individually all the way through
anything but that
is not good enough
not good enough because you would never
know if if any influence happened now
influence
may be beyond just vote counting right
it could cause you to vote the way you
do that's a separate question
but
somebody's got to be in charge of making
sure the elections are instantly
auditable and if this
kim weiman is not that person
then this is a complete failure
complete failure by the biden
administration i mean it's good that
they have a resource to help against
hacking
but it's not even close
to what the the job requires the job
requires that we have at least an
explicit goal
now i get that the states have control
of the elections right i will stipulate
that the states have control of the
elections but somebody
maybe the federal government should say
the objective is to be fully auditable
and fairly instantly
that should at least be the objective
even if the states say we can't get
there or
we need resources to do it or we don't
want to do it for one reason or not at
the very least it should be the
objective
right
so i'm going to say it's a small step in
slightly the right direction and i'll
give them credit for that but i don't
see evidence that it's anywhere near
enough
rhinos have no natural predators
that's interesting
somebody says that's not the goal it's
my goal
it's my goal
should be your goal right is there
anything
a rhino criticizes the gop for the wrong
things
but that's just that's just an opinion
that it's the wrong things
right i mean they just have a different
opinion
i
i i
you don't need to argue with me that you
disagree with it with a rhino
i mean there's there's nothing there
i get it you disagree with them there's
nothing else to be said about it really
it's not interesting in any way
um
all right
so uh
saturday night live how many how many
people saw saturday night live with
jason zedekis sedakis
roasting biden
did anybody see that
because it felt like a
it felt like a change in tone didn't it
did it look to you like
snl just said oh
hell we just can't ignore this anymore
biden's biden's a train wreck
it looked like they went at him pretty
hard they went after his sniffing
uh they went after his decline you know
how he used to be all energetic and now
he's there's not much left of him
i thought it was it was pretty brutal
now
are you surprised
because you know you've seen that cnn
has started to move against them you've
seen
poll numbers are crashing
i see it else it feels like
one of the last holdouts doesn't it
like if you can get snl to say all right
you know we had good hopes but it didn't
work out which is
somebody says that they went after him
very soft it was gentle in a sense but
they hit all the points
it did seem it did seem like there was a
gentle edge to it you're right you're
right about that but they did hit all
the points they did get his mental
decline they did get
you know
his uh
his craziness
um
who's a
bai deng
who is that
sounds like there's something good that
i don't know about
anyway the wall street journal has also
sounded the alarm the editorial board so
it's not just an article
the editorial board of the wall street
journal basically said we have to stop
ignoring the fact that biden is
incompetent
like you know mentally incompetent not
just bad at his job
that's a pretty big deal so now snl is
basically just put it out there
and now the wall street journal
editorial board
basically just reports it like an
obvious fact you don't even have to you
don't even need the medical examination
it's just sort of obvious now um
that's pretty amazing
and
i would love to ask
people privately who were big supporters
of biden
if they got what they wanted
i would love has anybody had that
conversation privately has anybody had a
private conversation because you act
differently in public because anybody
had a private conversation with a
democrat
who is
regretting their choice
because people tend to have cognitive
dissonance and say they're they were
right even if they were wrong
yeah you don't see much of it i
look how little there is you'd expect it
to be a lot of it because the polled
numbers are plunging right so therefore
there should be a lot of people who
change their minds
but you can't find them
yeah oh here's some
so yep my neighbor lisa says
um
there's still anything but trump yeah so
i guess they can defend their choice
because it's anything but trump i guess
you always have to fall back on
here's my question if we can put a tesla
automobile in space
and when i say we i don't mean me
because i had nothing to do with it but
humans at least some of us are smart
enough to get together and launch an
automobile into space
and yet
we can't invent a fake gun
that looks real on a movie
really
really the only way to shoot a movie
which is all make believe
is with a real gun with
that could at least potentially fire
real ammunition
nobody could make a fake gun
that would be an actual prop as opposed
to a real gun that they pretended as a
prop
can't do that
nobody's figured that out yet it does
feel as though there's a market for that
now my understanding is that there are
such things as prop guns
and a prop gun actually you couldn't put
a bullet in if you wanted it just be
blocked
but i'm i imagine the prop gun
doesn't have the same action or maybe it
doesn't flash the same or have the kick
or whatever it is that that makes it
look realistic in the movie
but we couldn't figure out how to solve
those problems
i mean that seems like a solvable
problem to me
to have a gun that makes a flash without
a bullet
you couldn't you couldn't make an
electronic gun
that just lights something that just
flashes out the
the barrel or something
i mean
really
how hard is that well we're also finding
out how dumb hollywood is
i'm going to read this story and you're
going to swear if you haven't already
heard the story
you're going to swear i'm making this up
all right
anybody who owns a gun or has been
around guns or knows anything about guns
you're going to think i made this up
this will be this will blow your
freaking mind
all right i swear to god this is true
and i'm going to read it
uh this is one from cnn
uh
there's this pastime that crew members
sometimes do and this is coming from
somebody who knows that world
somebody named waxman it's called
plinking
so there's something that movie crew
members do called plinking
and they go out into rural areas and
they shoot at beer cans
this is with live ammunition
in other words
they take the guns that are used for the
movie
they take them
to somewhere in a rural area
they replace
the blanks
with real bullets
and then they shoot at targets
and then they return the gun
i i i'm not making that up
they actually do that
now
every everybody who's had gun training
hold on hold on to the top of your head
because it's coming off it's coming off
isn't it okay
the top of my head
honestly can you think of anything
dumber
if you were going to
teach a class in gun safety
can you imagine a better anecdote of bad
behavior
now i know what the movie people are
going to say
they're going to say scott scott scott
there's somebody in charge of checking
all the guns before they're handed to an
actor
i mean
it's not like a live round is still
going to be in the chamber
scott
you fool that's why we hire somebody we
hire somebody just for that job to make
sure that gun is safe before it gets
handed to an actor
and all the people who have any gun
training whatsoever say
you are the dumbest person in the world
if you think that's a good idea because
now you've taken the failure point
and you put it on one person who's
underpaid and may not be paying
attention might come in with a hangover
that day and lives would be a stake
for somebody just to skip a step or
something
you would never
ever put a live round in a gun that's
going to be moved used in a movie
no matter how sure you were that you
were going to remove it this gets me to
a related topic
so i've had a side conversation with
somebody who works on movie sets a lot
you know is often on movie sets it's
it's his job
and is arguing
on the internet and can't understand why
people don't get his argument
and he argued that
alec baldwin is not
either responsible or 100 responsible
because there was somebody whose job it
was and it's the routine way that movies
are done somebody's job it was to make
sure that gun was safe before it was
given to him and therefore
the people who are saying that alec
baldwin is fully responsible
don't understand because clearly it was
somebody else's responsibility
and the whole point was to keep the
actor just as an actor and not have to
worry about this stuff so scott don't
you understand don't you understand
that the responsibility was
you know sort of shared at least
by the person whose job it was
here's my counter argument you ready
there's no such thing as one kind of
responsibility
and as soon as you imagine that there's
one thing called responsibility and it
can be defined one way
well you're lost because there's nothing
like that
there's legal responsibility
which has a standard
there's financial responsibility which
might be different
than the legal responsibility could be
the same
but could be different
then there's i what i would call common
sense responsibility has nothing to do
with
the law or anything else it's just what
makes sense to you like as a as an
ordinary person what makes sense
and then there's gun responsibility
back beyond this gun owners
so the rest of you who are not maybe
trained in firearms look to the comments
of the people who are and see if you
agree with a statement
gun responsibility
is absolute
it's absolute so there's no such thing
as sharing it
it's absolute and it's absolute for
everybody who touches it
in other words the gun owner or the
person who has it in the hand let's say
the person who has it in their hand is
100 responsible for what happens 100
even if
the person who gave it to him is also
100 responsible
so gun ownership is the only situation
in which the responsibility can add up
to over 100
am i right
which is illogical right because
responsibility can't add up to 100
but let me say it again
it does
because goat owners
gun owners
don't around
when it comes to safety right
there are absolutes
and when you're trying to argue with a
gun owner but but don't you get
that the system was that this other
person takes responsibility both people
had agreed
you know alec baldwin knew that
the person responsible knew it they had
agreed that it was her responsibility so
therefore no
no
blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah your reasons
nobody wants your reasons if you're a
gun owner or if you have a gun in your
hand it's your responsibility period
period
and nobody's going to listen to a
counter argument
because the moment you allow the counter
argument in
people get killed right the moment you
allow the well there could be an
exception
bam somebody's dead
because this was the exception
this was exactly the exception this is
why it always has to be 100. because the
moment you make the exception somebody
gets shot
every time
so you don't make that exception and has
nothing to do with legal responsibility
it's a different standard
legal responsibility is nuanced and you
know you really have to
figure out who did what and blah blah
blah
but
gun responsibility is irrational by
design
right it's rational irrationality
it's rational
to be irrational on gun safety and by
irrational i mean
you don't even put your finger on it
unless you're going to do something
productive with it right like
this is how irrational gun safety is if
your guns on you know if this is your
gun
you don't even you don't even do this
unless you're going to move it
productively like with a purpose
you don't do anything with a gun
anything
unless you're doing it with purpose and
safety right
so anyway people are not arguing the
same argument they're pretending it's
all responsibilities one thing or it's
logical or it's common sense it's none
of those things and it shouldn't be as
soon as you make that stuff common sense
people die
so there's a reason for it
i'm going to tell you something but i
can't tell you why
uh a lot of the big political stories
you're hearing now you you are
completely misled on what's really
behind them
i can't tell you which stories and i
can't tell you why
but just trust me i'm seeing in more
windows than you see
and i can't even frickin believe the
stuff i'm saying you're never gonna hear
why i don't think
i don't think you'll ever know what i'm
talking about
but oh my god the biggest stories are
just so completely
wrong
in important ways
anyway i'll just leave that there
cnn keeps dumping on facebook and i'm
loving it um
cnn's attack from the left and the right
so sienna's cnn is attacking facebook
for not
for not uh
censoring enough
and their examples would be
you know january 6 for example they
didn't censor enough so it caused people
to organize and do bad stuff
and then of course the right things they
censor too much
and you're not gonna like this
but it probably means they're doing a
good job
i hate to say it i'm not a fan of
facebook by the way i don't use it i
think it should go away i just don't
like anything about facebook honestly so
i'm not a i'm not a fan
but if you see that facebook is being
criticized
for being
not
sensorious enough
at the same time they're being
criticized for being too sensorious is
that a word sensorius censoring too much
i would think that's kind of where you
need to be
how could they possibly have both sides
happy about that
does anybody think there's something
they could do that would make both sides
happy
i don't know that that's even an option
now i'm not saying they're doing it the
way i would do it or or that it's flaw
free
clearly there are flaws but it looks to
be the kind of flaws that you would
expect in a free system
right
you know civilization has flaws
but we like to be civilized capitalism
has flaws
but it's still pretty good
compared to the alternatives uh
democracy and the republic and all that
lots and lots of flaws
but
nobody's figured out a better thing to
do
facebook is starting to feel like
democracy
it's a terrible system that we can't
figure out a better one
now i'm not supporting any decision they
made and i'm not going to criticize any
specific thing today i'm just saying
that
i wouldn't want
one side to be happy with facebook at
the other side to be unhappy
would you
tell me would you want one side to be
happy and the other side to be unhappy
no matter which side was happy
i wouldn't
that feels like a very unhealthy
situation
the healthiest situation is exactly what
we have
everybody's mad at facebook all the time
i hate to say it but that's literally
the healthiest situation everybody mad
at facebook all the time
all right
so what else we got going on here
there's a reason that i follow uh
michael malus on twitter
if you don't follow michael malus
and he's at
michael malus
just his name's put together
here's why i'm going to read you one of
his tweets
and you'll know why i follow him okay
just one tweet
he tweeted today or it might have been
yesterday
i wonder when alec baldwin will resume
shooting
and that's why i follow michael malus
maybe you should too
now a little more explanation
i've talked before how there are some
humorists such as norm mcdonald
who if you don't understand his humor
you don't realize that the joke is
always on the audience
so sometimes he's you know just joking
but lots of times the joke is about how
the audience is responding now dave
chappelle sometimes does the same thing
dave chappelle is operating at that you
know that high
level so that he's telling jokes but
also it's sort of about your reaction to
the jokes too right
and
you have to understand michael malus is
also about your reaction
right so don't don't automatically jump
to imagine he's a he's a monster because
he says things that get you wound up
his act if i can call it that
his approach maybe
is uh
he finds the worst thing you can say
about every topic
whatever is the worst thing you could
say and then he tweets it
and if you can't appreciate
you know the
i don't know i guess the the edge that
he brings to it
you probably shouldn't follow him
but if you get that he's doing it for
the reaction
then then it's just
it's just a great show so i recommend
them highly
and by the way you won't like it
sometimes
which is the point right sometimes it's
really gonna is really gonna rattle your
chain
all too
um
i
i've been accused
credibly
so here i'd like to agree with my
critics
sometimes people say scott scott
you you can't admit when you're wrong
but i think i do i think i do actually
but maybe i'm not admitting when i'm
wrong
um so i'll try to do it now
i'm gonna and i'm going to agree with my
critics that although i've said
over and over again
that for example that i don't care if
you get vaccinations the way i talk
about the pandemic
leads you to believe that i'm i'm
persuading you or that i have a
certainty about things i don't have
certainty about so i think my critics
are completely right
that you can accidentally
influence people just by what you talk
about most right so if i happen to talk
about things that were pro-vaccine
even if i'm not telling you to get it
you would internalize that as well he's
saying pro-vaccine things
how can you say you're not trying to
convince me to get it you keep saying
pro-vaccine things so as a public
service
because i know that it annoys a lot of
you i'm going to argue the opposite of
my opinion today
the same the same way that
you know i make the mistake the other
direction
so it won't be so much on making an
argument against my opinion
as much as i'm giving the other side of
the story is that is that fair
so i'm going to put i'm going to
concentrate on
something that's pro-ivermectin because
usually i talk about the opposite
so i'm going to tell you some things
that are pro-ivermectin even though i'm
almost always talking the opposite i'm
not trying to convince you
all right nothing nothing you hear now
will be to convince you it's good or bad
or anything i'm just going to take the
other side now this is a good exercise
it's a good exercise to see if you can
argue the other point
all right
if you can't argue the other side's
point
you have to ask yourself why is it
because the other side is just whack or
because you're so cognitively biased
that you can't even say the words
that the other side would say so
in the spirit of testing my own
cognitive dissonance
i'm going to give you show you an
exercise in which i
speak the opposite of my opinion
okay
it'll be on the vaccines and also on
ivermectin i think one other thing
i'm going to start with a little context
and we'll lead you into it rasmussen has
a poll about climate change
and asks people is climate change a
crisis 51 percent of the people said you
know uh hell yes
or
you know leaning yes
so over half the people think climate
change is crisis and it breaks down
exactly like you think 75 percent of
democrats and 31 percent of republicans
and interestingly the moderates are
right in the
middle um
which tells you something disturbing but
that's another story
um
and then rasmussen also asked
and i'm paraphrasing their questions
that
they put the questions in better form
than i'm going to paraphrase them so
just know that they know how to do
questions right even if i say them wrong
all right
they asked if if the country that goes
the hardest at climate change and green
energy stuff
will they reap the economic and jobs
benefit in green energy in other words
do you do people think that going hard
against climate change ends up being an
economic positive
and 56 percent said yes
56 percent
of the public
thinks that uh going hard at climate
change would be a positive economic
thing 38 disagree
all right
uh again remember i'm i'm just sort of
giving you some views here
um so i'm gonna do climate change and
then i'm gonna do uh cove as soon as i'm
done
and then do you agree with uh biden's
approach to climate 48 sported it but 46
do not
and six percent are unsure but i think
the unsure should be thrown in the do
not support
category that would be so
pretty much a tie
between supporting biden and not
sporting
and as michael schoelenberger is
pointing out the world's green renewable
experiment is over
so biden's climate bill is dead this is
in a michael shellenberger tweet today
norway affirmed oil drilling so norway
is basically saying okay green stuff
isn't working we better drill
let's get busy drilling for oil and even
uganda says that the solar and wind
force
and wind
uh cause poverty in africa so africa
is giving up on green energy norway
in some ways the united states in a
minor way at least the climate bill
um and
and the and germany's having the same
issue and i think
the uk is looking at so at nuclear and
stuff so basically
everything you thought you knew
or
people thought they knew
about green energy and its benefits
seems to be wrong
so at the same time the rasmussen is
saying
hey
look at all these
people who think the climate is a crisis
and biden's doing the right thing
are looking at countries all over the
world who also thought the climate was a
crisis and going green was the right
thing and they've all learned that they
were wrong and they're reversing their
decisions
at the same time people are saying yeah
biden looks good the majority of people
saying that looks good
while the rest of the world who already
went there is changing their mind
okay
also good
all right i'm going to argue the other
side quickly for
uh ivormectin stuff here's my question
if you had a drug that you knew worked
in a laboratory in a test tube and it
kills the virus in a test tube
why doesn't it work in people now i know
i know the reason you do the controlled
trials is because it's actually rare for
something that works in the test tube to
also work in a human
without hurting them
do we agree
everybody knows that the test tube
results actually rarely
work in people
so you would expect that just because it
works in a test tube doesn't really mean
anything to people
but
suppose you had a drug and and the
reason i'm i asked why is that you know
why can't you tell that it will work in
people what's the what's the mechanism
that ruins it
and we know it doesn't work but what's
the mechanism
and i heard a number of smart people say
well the body
rapidly breaks down chemicals so
whatever you put into a body as soon as
it interacts with your you know your
blood and your hormones and everything
it might break it down and so the
effectiveness you saw in the
test tube
could get just destroyed by the body
makes sense
but
suppose you have the special case
that the the drug you're testing is
already known not to break down in the
body
let's take ivermectin
as my example
right now remember i'm not promoting
ivermectin as as working because i don't
have any idea i'm just arguing the other
side to see if i can do it
ivermectin we know doesn't break down in
the body
so much that it doesn't work for what it
was invented for
so we know that the body
seems to keep ivermectin intact
long enough
to work against its original purpose you
know as a dewormer for horses for
example but in humans as well originally
created for humans
so if you know it's not going to break
down
and you know it kills a virus in a test
tube
can you really and you know and you know
what parts of the body it gets into
presumably you could find out it
wouldn't be hard i imagine take some
blood from a person and say okay
there's the coronavirus it's right there
in the blood
then you give them some ivormectin you
test their blood again you go okay
their blood has ivormectin and it also
has a coronavirus
do they both exist in the blood at the
same time
and are you telling me that if you put
something that doesn't break down
because we know it doesn't break down
for its other purposes
now it doesn't mean it doesn't break
down for this purpose right it could
break down in a specific way
that luckily doesn't matter to one
purpose but matters the other right so
there's all kinds of possibilities
but wouldn't you expect it to work
more often than not
as long as the drug itself doesn't
change too much in the body and it lasts
a little while
if if your blood
let me ask the question this way if i
drew your blood out and it had
coronavirus in it
so i've got a little
a little petri dish full of blood
let's say i put a bunsen burner under so
it stays about the right temperature as
your body
so now you've got real blood from a real
person with real virus in it
if you drop an ivermectin pill in there
i'm simplifying right it wouldn't be a
pill so put some ivormectin in there
and you just keep it at
98.6 and you check in an hour
is it going to have the same amount of
virus
what do you think
if you tested it outside the body but it
was a real person's blood with virus and
real hormones and
real everything else that's in real
blood because it's real blood
and you drop the ivormectin in
would it kill the ivormectin in the
blood
now i don't think we test it in blood
right
somebody give me a fact check on this
when they test it in the laboratory they
don't put it in anything like blood do
they they just put it in a dish with the
virus and some kind of
medium
am i right but shouldn't there be a step
where they drop it in human blood and
see if it makes any difference or it
just immediately breaks down
so here's my question
how in the world do we not know that
ivermectin
works
if it doesn't break down for its other
purposes
it doesn't give you side effects those
are the things we know
it does kill ivermectin in a laboratory
are you telling me nobody ever did a
test where they dropped it in a little
pint of blood real blood to see if it
made a difference nobody ever tested
that
because if it did
if you if you could if you could
neutralize a virus in real blood
let's say in an hour
and there was less of it it doesn't have
to be gone
but would it be noticeably less
how could it not work
right now
is this a good argument
is is my argument good
now remember i'm not i'm not giving you
certainty
there's no certainty involved here i'm
just saying
that
i would love to see an explanation
now if you're saying to yourself scott
this is why we test
randomized controlled trials exactly
your problem because you can't tell that
the laboratory extends to the real world
but are you telling me if you knew the
drug
at at the level given
let's say we knew that the drug was
going to be administered at the same
level it is for other stuff and we know
it doesn't have side effects and we know
it doesn't break down quickly
because it works for something else it
doesn't break down too fast for that
are you telling me that you couldn't
test that in blood
in a laboratory and really really be
close to knowing if it worked again no
certainty that's why you do the
randomized control tests
right
right now keep in mind
what i'm doing here i'm not promoting
ivermectin or talking against it i'm
saying that i hadn't spent enough time
talking about the possibility it would
work
the possibility
now many of you have pointed out ad
nauseam follow the money and it's about
the big pharma doesn't want the cheap
thing to work because it's off patent
blah blah blah blah
could is it possible
that big pharma
could block
ivermectin in every way that people are
looking at it
because it'd be pretty massive
do you think big pharma
could influence like everybody
everywhere in the world like all the
governments and all the experts
yeah they could
yeah they could
if they could find a choke point
now i doubt they could do it retail
meaning go to every person and bribe
every person and you know get to them
individually or something like that so
you can't get to them individually
but who controls the data
who controls the data
where does it come from
because if they control the data
then yeah they can control what
everybody thinks of it
now
do the big pharma companies uh do they
get involved in the trials
who is it who's funding the trials of
ivormectin
do you know
i don't know
suppose they're funded but maybe some
money went to pharma to some middleman
to some other middleman
and then to the
study would you know it
i wouldn't know it
i mean does anybody know who funds
studies i'm not even is that always
reported i don't know if it's always
reported
but
it's possible
so
so part of my argument had been you know
there's no way this conspiracy theory
could possibly be
true because too many people would have
noticed it did work
too many countries would have run a
trial where it did work and then it
would be working in the real world and
that everybody would notice
and so i've argued that it would be
impossible
to
to conceal such a mass conspiracy that
affects so many people in this such a
big you know dollar and life and death
and everything else
unless
they control the data
and they could
so i'm not saying they do i'm saying you
can't rule out the possibility that the
big pharma controls
enough of the trials they wouldn't have
to control all the trials they would
only have to control the big ones
or the put people in charge who don't
know how to do trials or there's
probably a million ways you can ruin
data or manage it all right
so
uh so that's my
pro-ivermectin argument and again i'm
not pro-ifmectin if i have to guess
i'm gonna guess against it being a big
deal
meaning maybe it makes some difference
but i doubt it would change the pandemic
so that's where my opinion is but i
haven't spent enough time talking the
other side so there you go all right how
about on vaccinations i i tweeted out
earlier i gotta run in a minute
um
graphs from
who was it jason lewis
who is a scientist but he's a material
scientist but he apparently has
experience as a medical data
analyst
so he's somebody who's good at data
systems and analytics and he's a
scientist not not the right kind for
virology but he does do medical data
analysis right so he knows data and he
knows where to get it and he knows how
to look at it right so it's sort of the
right person right
and he did studies of vaccinations to
see if x nations work and sure enough
there's like a totally solid correlation
the more you're vaccinated the fewer the
fewer
problems you have
correlation is unmistakable you can't
miss it
very very clear correlation vaccination
boom lower problems
but
turns out
there's a little bit of a surprise
involved in the data
which is that the infections turn down
before the vaccinations
pray reliably
which means
and this is just speculation from jason
the vaccinations might not be the cause
of the decline
because the decline starts well before
the vaccinations and just continues
and he suggests people
you've got a lot of problems and by then
you've already masked up and put on and
done social isolation
remember i'm not arguing my point of
view
right if you're joining late this is not
my point of view i'm just trying to give
the opposite point of view of what i
usually do to show that i can do it okay
so
he's got
a suggestion
that the the vaccinations might not make
any difference
and the the masking and the social
distances might make a lot of difference
not concluding
that's not a conclusion
it's just somebody who's really good
looking at the number said
the numbers don't explain why the
the dip
comes well before the vaccinations
right so there is at least one person
who's good with data who says the data
is i think he used the word uh
agnostic
about whether the vaccinations work
think about that
that here's somebody who's really good
with data he's using public data so you
can check his horses i guess
and he says
it doesn't doesn't make the case
it doesn't not make the case
but it doesn't make the case because the
dip starts before the vaccinations
all right
now
again
personally i think
if i had to guess i think there's
slightly more chance or maybe a lot more
chance that the vaccinations work
i got vaccinated i don't recommend you
do
because there is some doubt right
if i told you i'm certain i made the
right decision i'd just be an idiot
if i told you i was certain you made the
right decision i'd be a bigger idiot
nobody could be certain about this stuff
so just for balance
i show you the argument on the other
side
now since you also don't believe many of
you that maths and distancing work you
probably don't buy his alternative
explanation but it does suggest that
there's something in the data we don't
understand that's probably the only
thing you can conclude the only thing
you know for sure is there something you
don't understand
not necessarily the vaccinations
are not going to work
all right
how many how many anecdotal reports have
you seen of somebody who uh
forgot to get vaccinated or didn't get
vaccinated and they died
a lot right cnn used to do one every day
every day didn't get vaccinated i'm
dying didn't get vaccinated i wish i had
didn't get vaccinated
where are all the anecdotal reports
of people who took ivermectin early when
they first got symptoms
and died anyway not horse dewormer and
not overdosing on horse teamwork
but where are the reports of even one
person
just one
just one
who took ivermectin early
and then died anyway and didn't take
anything else just ivermectin and died
anyway
not one
because cnn is pushing pretty hard on
this anecdotal persuasion
they can't find one person
who took the ivermectin
and then died anyway
now
again i'll remind you if you're coming
here late i'm not pro-ivermectin
my personal opinion is that we'll
probably find out it's weak or doesn't
make much difference
but
isn't it a fair fair question why we
haven't seen one example
of what the news tells us is true
the news tells us it doesn't work
probably there are i know tens of
thousands of people using it anyway
you've got a lot of people
that you can look at and ask yourself
all right did any of them die
now you could say okay that's what the
that's what the trials are
the trials sort of sum it up but where's
that one person
i i get that the trials show that it you
know some people died even on ivermectin
that must be true
but but where's the anecdotal story
because you know they want to give it to
you because they they want you to hear
that anecdotal story where is it
all right
i also asked the question is it
unethical to test a new therapeutic
because if we know regeneron works which
we do
how can you not give it to somebody who
has coveted
how can you give somebody some new
therapeutic that you're testing without
also giving them regeneron
because if you don't give them regeneron
they might die
so ethically can you do you do a test of
another therapeutic once you have one
that works
i don't know they can
all right uh adam dopamine had an
interesting uh tweet
listen to this tweet all the way to the
last word
listen to it all the way to the last
word
adam says
the dog not barking it's been 10 weeks
since pfizer was fully fda approved too
much fanfare
moderna still not approved even though
the emergency authorization
was granted only one week apart from
from pfizer
really raises concern
that there is something wrong with the
modernis
lobbyists
good tweet
there's something wrong with the
modernist
lobbyists
that is a well-constructed tweet ladies
and gentlemen this is my show i must go
now i hope that i have satisfied some of
my critics in the in the limited sense
that i can i can give you an argument
for the other side doesn't mean is right
but i think i gave you an argument that
at least has a little bit of weight on
the other side wouldn't you agree
good thank you some of you were lucky
i've got to run i wish i could stay
longer but it's been a treat
to be with you
