do do
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of human
civilization that's called coffee with
Scott Adams
and would you like to take this
experience
up to levels that even astrophysicists
cannot imagine because the universe is
too big
that didn't even make any sense but it
won't matter to the simultaneous sip all
you need is a cup of Margaret a glass of
tanker chalice or Steiner came to your
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like a
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
day of the day I think it makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous simple Tapas now go
oh that was perfect
I'm pretty sure I nailed it and that's a
good sign for the rest of the day
how many of you have ever heard of
something called it aphantasia
it's the ability to see things in your
mind
I didn't know that people were all over
the map on that and apparently people
don't there are some people who don't
think in the images
I don't even know what to think about
that because I only do and apparently
the test
I was just seeing this on Wikipedia or
someplace is if I told you to imagine an
apple
and then I said describe to me what you
see in your mind
apparently there's a wide range of how
clearly people see the Apple
now
I'm a sort of an artist
I'm sort of an artist by profession
and
I can tell you that I can see the apple
as clearly as a photograph
how many of you would say that
if I imagine it it's just like a
photograph
yeah usually all the details I can
rotate it I can change its color
just like a photograph now how many of
you would say the opposite and I think
it might be like just five percent of
people or less or fewer
um
how many of you would say you can't see
the Apple at all
is there some who say you can't see it
at all it's just sort of a concept of an
apple but you don't actually see it so
we have some right yeah there's some
people saying that that applies to them
too
you know this I don't think there could
be a better example
of understanding how differently people
are experiencing their reality
I I honestly don't even have a way to
imagine
what it would be like if your
imagination didn't reproduce things
as well as the real world
I don't even know what it would feel
like I have no way to even visualize
well I can't imagine it I suppose if it
were visual I could visualize it
so one of the secrets about why I can
draw
you know let's say a new object is that
I'm tracing it
it's actually tracing
I know you hate me because that makes
you sound too easy but I see it first
and then I just put the lines on where I
see it
now if you can't do that and apparently
there are a number of you who can't how
would you ever learn to draw
it feels like if you tried to draw it'd
be like stick figures and stuff because
the one in your mind
you wouldn't know what it looks like in
the paper
right so I would guess and when I see
artists who could do photorealistic
drawings I think maybe they're even you
know further than I am in terms of being
able to see it or actually yeah they do
more than seeing it it's like they're
seeing it plus something else plus what
they're adding I guess
now I here's another theory you know
affirmations the idea of visualizing
your goals
I've had good good luck anecdotally not
scientifically speaking but anecdotally
it seems like when I've when I can
visualize what I want really clearly
the odds of it happening are so close to
100 percent
and there are things that I tell myself
I want that even I have trouble
visualizing
it's more of a concept I don't get those
but when I can see myself standing there
you know I'm with a person or I got a
bag of money or something I really
really see
damn it it just seems to happen so
that's one of the things I've been
hypothesizing over a long time
is it possible that the more clearly you
can imagine something for your for your
visualizations and your
attainment of your success is it
possible that actually determines
whether you'll be successful that you
can you can draw up a picture in your
head
because my theory is that brains
that's one of the ways you program your
brain
right if you think your brain is in
charge of you
and you're just doing what your brain's
telling you you're lost you're just
wandering around but you should be able
to use the executive function of your
brain
to do something like visualization which
should be effectively reprogramming your
brain to make it more effective so
reality is pretty subjective and maybe
that's all that's happening here but it
does seem to be that if you could
visualize something clearly the odds of
it happening are pretty high
all right
um Twitter has become X
so now you're not sending Tweets anymore
you're exclaiming
somebody sent that on Twitter
if I remember to I'd give them credit
but I don't remember who I don't think
we're going to use that one we're not
going to use that it's not going to be
exclaiming I think it's still going to
be tweeting what do you think
I think this is a prince becoming the
the symbol
you know the the artist formerly known
as Prince
because I'm going to do the thing
formally known as tweeting
and then eventually I'm going to stop
I'm going to lose the formerly known as
and I'm just calling tweeting again
so I'm going to say well I was Xing
today
formerly known as tweeting
and I'll start just saying formerly
known as tweeting I'll drop the ax and
then I'll drop the formerly known as
tweeting and I'll be right back to
tweeting
that's that's how I'm going to play it
anybody with me
I'm not I'm not going to stop calling it
tweeting and I'm pretty sure we could
call it whatever we want
you know would just make it so make it
so as they say are in Star Trek
all right I got a context note on a
tweet
you know how Twitter will add Community
notes
are there two things is there a
community note and a context note or are
they really the same thing
does anyone know if that's two different
things or one thing
let's see if anybody knows because most
of you haven't seen one or both so how
would you know it's the same thing
somebody says it's the same
so let me just give you uh idea how this
worked I'm actually very happy
with the community note or maybe it's
just reader added context notes I think
it's working really well it's imperfect
all things are imperfect but I'll give
you an example so here's where I got a
context note put on my tweet there was a
clip uh President Biden
um with an evil looking grin on his face
subjectively speaking according to me
um muttering that he would look into
Elon Musk and Twitter to see if there
were any crimes there
now when I saw him muttering that he was
going to look into Twitter to see if any
crimes were there I said to myself what
since when do you go looking for crimes
that's the scariest thing so I tweeted
something about it sounded like a uh the
plot of a bad movie where there's an
alternative America that's been taken
over by a dictator
because listening to Biden say that he
was going to look into
musk's purchase of Twitter
just to see if there's anything wrong in
terms of Homeland Security
why would there be
why would there be a problem like what
would make you even think you need to
look and wouldn't that apply to every
citizen you know my neighbor Bob
I'm not aware of any crimes he's
committed but when I talked to him
I'm a little bit suspicious and I think
maybe we should go you know overturn his
finances and see if we got any crimes
there nobody would stand for that but
there was the the leader of the country
standing there saying basically a
dictator kind of a statement
now that the context note
was that this was an old video
is that useful
was it useful to me to know that this
happened around the time of the
transaction it did not happen this week
is that a good Community note I'd say
yes
I say yes because that's good context
you you need to know when stuff happened
to understand it in his fullness so good
note but it also went on to say that it
was it was more about the the question
of the original buying of the company
now that doesn't change my tweet
would you agree it doesn't invalidate my
tweet it just you know takes a little
edge off it gives a little context I
thought this was all good
would you agree
this was nothing but good a good context
yeah and and the reason I'm bringing it
up is it's because it happened to me
trust me if you get a context note your
first reaction will be negative
and to that point one of the things the
context note lets you do if you're the
Tweeter maybe maybe everybody unless you
rate the context note
so the context note kind of rates you
but then you can rate the context note
and my first reaction was damn it
and I like I I said it was useless
so I gave it a useless grade
and then I slept on it and I looked at
it the next day
and I thought oh
maybe I was a little Hasty maybe that
maybe that context note is 100 accurate
and add something to the understanding
of the Tweet okay damn it you're right
so I'm going to give you the win
you get the win Twitter
the company that formerly was known as
Twitter
all right
um let's talk about the summer news I
think summer news is so funny so summer
news usually is somebody misinterpreting
a public figure and then pretending to
be really angry about it and that's
called Summer news
so when Jason Aldean does his Song and
people say we see some racist stuff in
there that's totally not there
they go ah they get all they get all
theatrically upset about it but they're
not really upset literally nobody cares
it's just summer news and of course you
know we've talked about Kamala Harris
um now she's talking about the Florida
um
these school lessons for history and she
believes that they're teaching kids that
uh
this slavery had an upside
there was something good about slavery
of course that's not non-existent right
of course if you look for it it wouldn't
be there but fake news so they said in
Cobble out to do to get to get angry
about fake news
imagine if you had been elected the vice
president of the United States
and they're saying okay what what
valuable portfolio can we give you
so first they give you immigration you
know the border control
and you do absolutely nothing useful
for a few years
so all right all right maybe that was
just hard
so then AI is an existential threat to
humanity some say so they give the AI
portfolio to to Harris and what did she
do to make everything better
well nothing nothing so I don't think
there's any job you can give her that
will result in some kind of positive
outcome so while if you had an employee
like that
you know sort of a Wally employee if you
use the the Dilbert analogy if you had a
Wally employee
and Time After Time the projects don't
get done what do you do with them
what's the next project you give them if
you don't want to fire them or it's too
much trouble
you give them the least important most
 job something that only needs
to be done so that people know it's
being done but has no value to the world
has no possible benefit at all
and that would be complaining about the
Florida Curriculum by imagining what it
is and then getting really mad at what
she imagined
what is not real
and that's her current job
now do you think she's going out and
talking about this topic because that
was the thing she came up with on her
own oh yeah I think this is where I'll
put my time and energy I doubt it
to me it looks like an assignment how
many of you would agree that her talking
about this topic has to be certainly an
assignment I don't think the vice
presidents just go out and on their own
pick a topic and start complaining about
it yeah she actually would just just
think about this do you believe that the
people who assigned or the topic
think that the topic is real meaning
that Florida is actually teaching kids
yeah you know Florida that slavery
wasn't all bad do you think that's
really happening
of course not no there's nobody in the
White House who believes it's real
they actually assigned her an imaginary
job
tell me that's not true
tell me that's not true
Kamala Harris was intentionally assigned
an imaginary job
because she could not fulfill
any real assignment
they wallied her she's being wallied
right that's what the point here boss
does he doesn't want to go through the
paperwork of firing Wally so he just
gives him uh he usually lends him to
another manager who asks for some
resources you know uh hey could you
maybe lend me an engineer for this
project you know somebody would sort of
dotted line report to me for a while you
know but it'll just be alone and the
point of your boss says uh sure
you're not only my co-worker manager but
you're sort of my competitor in this
company because if you get the promotion
I can't so I'll be glad to help you
because I'm a team player
how about Wally
you can have them as long as you want
yeah so the qualification of the vice
president continues
I saw a tweet from
um somebody named Andy Petro
he said this is a great tweet all the
imaginary people who think slavery was
okay are the worst
all the real people who think the
imaginary people are real are the second
worst
summer news
you know if anybody takes summer news
seriously you're falling into their trap
what do you see somebody complaining
about any of this stuff
just say summer news
yeah can't wait for the real stuff
all right here's one of my there's a lot
of funny news today I mean I think it's
all funny
um so NPR
as a headline talking about the
right-wing conspiracy about eating bugs
so NPR is essentially demonizing the the
right part of the country
for saying that the left part of the
country is promoting the eating of bugs
sometime soon for protein
so while NPR is mocking the right wing
for imagining there's some conspiracy
about eating bugs
Stephen Miller on Twitter
the formerly the company formerly known
as Twitter
he uh tweeted yes I'm calling it tweeted
he tweeted that he tweeted three
headlines from NPR talking about the
value of eating bugs
so NPR
is blaming the right wing for starting
this bug eating
conspiracy theory
at the same time NPR's own headlines
there's three of them recently about the
possible value of eating all the bugs
and I think Stephen Miller asked if NPR
reads NPR or listens to does NPR
actually listen to NPR or do they know
not to
oh yeah we produce we produce content
but God knows we're not going to listen
to it we don't want to get hypnotized
so
the the the
clownishness of the world is the
um the macro theme for today so today's
theme is American National incompetence
how many of you would agree with the
statement that there's an incompetence
crisis in America
how many of you would agree with that
statement
and then comp a competence crisis
basically you could call it incompetence
crisis
to me it seems obvious and I'm going to
talk about that more but notice how the
stories are all going to have that
quality
right we'll talk about the causes that's
coming up but but do you notice all the
stories in the news
they don't really look like something
just went wrong
they don't really look like we disagree
on priorities
it's not looking like a difference of
priorities or preferences it doesn't
look like there was a natural problem
and people have Solutions it doesn't
look that like that at all it looks like
incompetence is the issue
let me say this in the cleanest way I
can
do we have do we have a problem with
climate change do we have a problem with
inflation do we have a problem with
let's say the Ukraine war well on some
level you'd say yes
but wait a minute
could there be one problem that caused
all of those problems
yes and I don't mean it I don't mean it
necessarily caused the war or cause
climate change I mean that the way we
deal with all of these topics has has
left the realm of anything sensible if
if ever we were there
so we've we've upgraded to a realm of
pure incompetence
where the incompetence itself becomes
the topic so we're only talking about
the incompetence we don't have anything
going on that's talking about making the
problems better
right we have an incompetence crisis
where we've just we've replaced the
topics
with talking about our own incompetence
because we don't even know how to get
out of that loop we're a little bubble
of our own incompetence all right
so Kamala Harris is obviously an example
of an incompetence crisis Joe Biden is
clearly an example of all quality
competence crisis clearly an example
do you know that we've got two
candidates the leading candidates
who may be running to stay in a jail
at least in part
right now
as much as you might want Trump to be
president has he ever done anything that
might have technically violated some
kind of law
I don't know maybe
probably do they all do that as someone
when you reach a certain level are they
all violating technical laws I think so
my guess would be they're all violating
some technical law that nobody cares
about
but uh
how is it that we've got three
I would say three hyper-capable
candidates and they're fighting for
second place in the primaries they're
not even fighting for a second place in
the general
so RFK Jr clearly more qualified than
Biden by a lot
fighting for even to be on the ballot
and be a second choice right if you look
at the Republican side I think Trump is
very capable he just causes people to
lose their right if I had
one problem with jump it's just that it
just causes people to lose their
right so that's not a competence problem
that's you know something that just
comes with the whole program I guess
but you look at the capability of a
vague ramaswamy
oh my god do I want that as the model
for the future
I just want somebody who's just killing
it with competence
and everybody's watching and your kids
are watching they're like did he really
do that
did he just sit down and play uh concert
piano level and then he went off and
played tennis at a college level and
then he started at uh you know startups
and now he's running for president and
making a big dent and changing the world
is that all the same person
it's all the same guy it's like one guy
you don't think you want your kids to
see that the the talent stack concept
brought alive I mean he brings alive the
talent stack idea that if you layer
enough talents you know by working on
those talents you can create something
extraordinary from the sum of it
quite a basic and I'll say for the
DeSantis lovers highly capable highly
capable very admirable
you'd love to have a president who just
demonstrated that level of skill
you know you could disagree about his
preferences and his policies and you
might like somebody better but is
anybody calling DeSantis incapable
nobody right
I don't believe there's a single person
who says oh that DeSantis he can't get
anything done
it's not even part of the question
so we do have super capable people who
are trying fighting to
to get out right I would also say that
in the the category that I call the
internet dads
which includes women I'm just you know
sort of using it as a label but the uh
the internet dads are showing a level of
capability that's just crazy
right you know the the Jordan Peterson's
uh you know David sacks that Elon musk's
um Mike cernovich is you know I can go
on but you know who they are you you
know who the dads are and you know if
you if you read just read a week of
cernovich tweets
your IQ goes up like Five Points right
there's some super qualified people
who are getting deeply into the you know
the process
it's just hard for them to break through
past that top crust of okay incapable
people
yeah talker is another example highly
capable
all right let's talk more about the same
topic through UFOs I saw uh Eric
Weinstein that had a tweet thread on the
UFO mystery I'll call it
the I thought he did a great job of
summarizing the frustration of all the
smart people
so I'm just going to read one part of
his thread which was tremendous and I
recommend it just just because I think
he just does a great job of just
summarizing
what's going on with the whole UFO
mystery all right but here he restated
something I guess he said before he goes
I stand by my statement something is
wildly off and then he gives you the
options for what might be happening a
are pilots are crazy and or Liars so the
pilots who claim they say UFOs are
either crazy or Liars so as I go see if
any of these
makes sense to you B There is a psyop
gaslighting our own people
you know some kind of government plan to
fool us see we are too incompetent
to call our own people
uh wait we are too incompetent to call
our own people
is that a typo or does that make sense
to you
we're too incompetent to call our own
people
I'm not sure what that one means it must
be a typo
um D there is a secret long-standing
involvement of top scientists in other
words a top scientist they know there's
something going on but they're not
telling you
uh e there are some crazy seagull and
mylar balloon effects
so there's just something up there but
it's not UFOs
a cult of UFOs has infected the Pentagon
so you know a mental problem
uh or
China and others are taking over our
airspace and we're using UFOs as an
excuse rather than dealing with a
problem
so we're telling the public that it's
UFOs when it's really Chinese
technology or something
um
and then that he I love his conclusion
all right so this is uh Eric Weinstein's
conclusion of all this uh confusion he
says but this is so stupid to be this
far in with so much
dot dot dot I'm embarrassed for us
I'm with you Eric
same page it's literally embarrassing
does anybody have that feeling
like as an American I'm literally
embarrassed
that we can't we can't work through this
harassment I would say I've removed it
from my life as anything that influences
me I'm not I'm not bothered by any level
of embarrassment and you shouldn't be
either if you can learn to be free of
embarrassment it's like a freaking
superpower
um
but you but you know what I'm saying
it's just not a good look you know it
doesn't bother me to my core but you
know I'm not proud of it not proud of it
I am not proud of being an American
based on this you know I I am proud of
being an American but not based on this
story
so I want to add a few hypotheses to his
list so he's got a through e or G
I didn't understand one of them I think
it's typo but I'll add my own take
I think it's a combination of the
following so it's not one of these
things it's a combination of all these
things optical illusions we just see
some things we didn't know what they
were Tech malfunctions
in our sensing equipment
um or it might be just you know a
feature slash bug that doesn't look like
a malfunction it could be confirmation
bias you know if you're expecting to see
something you see it everywhere could be
summer summer hosters
some not all but some of them might be
just literally hoaxers uh then there's
cognitive dissonance you got your
grifters you've got the effect of money
that you know distorts everything
and then on top of that on top of the
reality or non-reality of these UFOs
separately but connected is the timing
of when we learn about alleged new stuff
I believe the timing is strategic
which is independent of whether there
are any real UFOs that's a separate
question but the timing for when the
news stories about UFOs is that's
probably political
not for sure
but it seems like there's always
something that's embarrassing for
Democrats who are in power
when it comes out but
the you're working against that theory
is as stuff came out during the Trump
administration too
and I don't recall that that was
necessarily timed to any bad Democrat
news
so I don't I don't think the hypothesis
that it's always timed to cover up the
news
works every time
but could it have been done once
is there any one time then somebody said
you know this would be a good time for
this story
maybe so I do think that there's a
possibility that the media gives it more
attention when there's something that
they don't want to talk about
but that doesn't mean they're
necessarily doing it consciously right
if Fox news is talking about all the bad
behavior of the Democrats and they've
got five good stories you know like
Hunter's laptop and you know new new
whistleblowers they get all that and CNN
kind of doesn't want to talk about it at
all
what do they have
right you better talk about UFOs because
you want to stay away from that stuff so
I think it's a whole bunch of ordinary
things I do not think any of the
extraordinary explanations are likely
right so listen to how many of
uh Eric Weinstein's uh potential you
know these are ways that could be
explained how many of them are
extraordinary all right so just see so I
gave you a list of possibilities they're
all ordinary yeah technology bugs
most ordinary thing in the world
confirmation bias that's so ordinary is
the operating system of human beings
that's the most ordinary thing you think
it's there but it's not
cognitive dissonance all ordinary so
everything on my list would explain
everything we're seeing hoaxers grifters
money media
and it wouldn't require any
extraordinary anything it wouldn't
require any new introduction of any new
effects
it would purely be explained by all the
ordinary stuff but look at Eric's list
our Pilots are crazy or Liars
well if it were one or two pilots
crazier Liars would be a pretty good
hypothesis but it seems to be a lot of
them
right or at least enough that crazy and
liar crazy and lying is probably ruled
out
that would be extraordinary there's a
Psy up gaslighting our own people well
psyups to Gaslight us we know are common
would you agree it's common to have
psyops but I don't think that the
government would use UFOs for a psyop
that would be extraordinary what would
not be extraordinary is to say there's a
let's say an anonymous source
that wouldn't be extraordinary because
they do that all the time it wouldn't be
extraordinary to say there's a pre-print
study that says you should shove masks
up your ass to stop cancer
right that's ordinary
like lying in a pre-print study that's
just ordinary or or not being accurate
how about we're two in I don't know
about the incompetent one that's might
be the typo all right there's a secret
long-standing involvement of top
scientists
and no top scientist has talked
well that would be extraordinary
right not likely
there are crazy seagulls and mylar
balloon effects well that actually gets
to what I was saying that there might be
just a technical glitch or optical
illusion right so I think that one's
more in the ordinary category where
there's a cult of UFOs is infected the
Pentagon I think that's confirmation
bias and the fact that UFOs are fun and
everything else is less fun
if you're if you're working in the
Pentagon name one topic that's more fun
than talking about UFOs
well we got to find in if there's you
know illegal chemical weapons
UFOs ah UFOs so you'd expect that people
chase fun
so they like it so of course there are
people in the UFOs in the military who
want to talk about UFOs UFOs are fun
all right China's and I don't think it's
likely that China is taking over our
airspace with their advanced advanced
machines and we don't know the
difference or we don't want to talk
about it so
so my theory is it's ordinary
that the UFO thing is ordinary let me
tell you why I think it's ordinary
beyond the fact that all of the elements
to make it happen are ordinary
the history of humankind
is one hoax after another like this
you know that right
there's never a better time in human
history where there were not multiple
hoaxes that had multiple people saying
they were true
my favorite one is was it earlier in
20th century when there were all these
hoaxes about giant bones
all right they were finding skeletons of
giant bones and there were a lot of them
if you just went by how many there were
and you went by how many people told you
they saw it with their own eyes and he
went by the media reports that they were
true and you talked to the scientists
who said oh yeah I saw it
you would think that was pretty true
zero of them were true
zero it was just like widespread you
know giant bones all over the place but
we don't have any
the Smithsonian has zero giant bones
now how different is the giant bones
hoaxes than the UFO story
what what part of the giant bones hoax
is not 100 common
to the story about the UFOs yeah we have
better technology
but does it matter if you have good
technology if you know you're seeing a
Tic Tac if you think it's a UFO you know
the humans are doing the interpreting
now the the diet bones hoax period
lasted many years just like the UFOs
now
you also know I'm not going to name
names but uh there are there have been
some Modern religions not going to name
any names
that seem to have lots of people who are
direct Witnesses and they'll sell out
and you know hundreds maybe maybe
millions of people
you know join something that was born
just a few hundred years ago
so
people massively believing in something
that isn't true including believing they
saw it with their own eyes they heard it
they experienced it
is very common
so if you're asking yourself what's
common and what's uncommon a gigantic
hoax about UFOs that last for years has
hundreds of direct eyewitnesses that
feel credible has actually technology
like radar that seems to be recording it
has every sign for being real
and even the media suggests it's real
none of that has any validity
we have a long history of none of that
ever mattering do anything it's just
Oaks
now could I be wrong
I hope so wouldn't that be cool
I love it yeah well unless you're here
to kill us
but I would say
if you're doing the Carl Sagan analysis
the Carl Sagan analysis is this looks
like every other hoax
why would it be different
this is the extraordinary one
Maybe
but I would say if you're going to put
odds on UFOs being real I'd say a
hundred to one against it
under to one against it based on the
fact it looks exactly like every other
hoax through Modern History they're all
the same
they don't look different
you know so I asked this question on
on
the service formerly known as Twitter
so I said if you want to figure out
let's say
the truth about climate change
the truth about climate change
and you had a choice you could only talk
to scientists
just scientists or experts on the
history of hoaxes
experts on the history of media hoaxes
especially
who would give you a more useful answer
the scientists
or the people who who know what hoaxes
look like
through history
well I think three quarters of the
people who answered that of course were
biased in their answer so they said the
the media hoaxers
and I think that's true
I think climate change is so perfectly
like
a dozen other hoaxes
now when I say hoax I don't mean that
there's nothing true about it
let me be clear
I think the basic idea that if all else
was equal and you added some CO2 to a
closed system it'd probably get warmer
I believe that
do I believe that
um
that climate change is not a problem
because a million years ago we had more
CO2
does anybody think that the climate
change is not much of a problem because
a million years ago we had more CO2
does that make sense to you
does that sound logical to you that a
million years ago there was more CO2 and
the world was thriving therefore the
current level of CO2 is not dangerous
you know that's not logical right
even Thomas Massey was making this case
and I I was I was cringing
because Massey is sort of my standard
for good behavior you know he's like the
standard for a rational scientific
approach but I saw him actually a video
arguing
that CO2 was much higher you know like a
thousand parts per million instead of
400 in the distant past does it do you
all know what's wrong with that argument
now John Kerry tried to defuse it by
saying this but people weren't here
you know humans weren't here
that's a terrible terrible defense would
you like to hear the good argument and
the good defense
well there's no good argument there's no
good argument that says a million years
ago the CO2 was higher therefore it's
not a problem today there's no
connecting logic to that do you know why
because everything was different a
million years ago
right the brightness of the sun was
different the composition of the
atmosphere was different
everything was different
so if everything's different a high
level of CO2 may have been no problem at
all
maybe it was no problem
so John Kerry's correct answer should
have been not there were no humans
because what is the obviously you say to
there were no humans we were teeming
with life
their life was all over the planet there
was probably more life on the planet
then than there is now because of the
you know Extinction of species so
it's a it's a terrible charge you know
Massey's claim that it's meaningful that
there was more CO2 in the distant past
it is just not meaningful
is not because all the other variables
were also different so it may be that
you needed more CO2 in the past
because the sun wasn't as warm
right that would be a positive CO2
because it was keeping you warm when the
sun wasn't doing its job but now this is
just an example I'm not I'm not making a
claim about the sun I'm using this as an
example but suppose the sun got a little
warmer in a million years
well then you better not have all that
CO2
right
so the right answer is all the other
variables were different you can't
compare the past
why is it that neither of them could get
that right
and let me check 100 of you agree right
if I convinced 100 of you that I'm right
about this I think I it's easy
I mean the argument is so plain and
simple
no
all right if you disagree give me one
sentence of disagreement go
the the one sentence why that why what I
said is wrong why is why is the CO2 from
a million years ago
uh relevant
okay you all got quiet when I had to say
you all got quiet didn't you here's
here's the best argument I have for the
other side
is this is the best one
quote you're vaccinated
oh well
and then there's always somebody in the
comments who's blaming it on the Jews
I assume that's satire
all right I'm going to give you the
benefit of a doubt all right the benefit
of a doubt that that was satire right I
don't want to say that in the
comments otherwise
I don't I don't I don't want to say this
every day either right can you maybe not
do anti-semitic things in the comments
like maybe that's just not cool
how about a lot less of that huh
so you know Free Speech fine
but it doesn't belong everywhere
it's not satire
let me let me take a break here let me
take a break
so you got a group of people in the
world
who everybody knows or unusually
successful
let's call them melbonians and these
albonians are really good at going to
school and getting Advanced degrees and
with their Advanced degrees
they have lots of opportunities
especially at the higher levels of
business and Society
so they take their better degrees
and they start doing really well so well
that they look at what would be the best
industry to be in if you could be in any
industry
so these about albonians that I'm
talking about are so well trained
they've got such good educations that
they could be in Tech they could be in
government they could be in Media
really they could just call their shots
and if you were in Media
you do well you might even be the boss
after a number of years of you know
having experience
so once the albonians just sort of work
through the system just being the
albonians
eventually the albonians look to be
dominating a lot of important industries
now why is it that they dominate the
important industries
and somebody would say Hollywood too
because that influences our minds why
why are they all in the why are all
these albonians in the important
industries and why do they have all this
power
because they went to school
would you like your family to be
captains of industry and maybe head up a
media company someday
how about sending them to school
how about if you send your kids to
 school they can be the CEOs of a
media company too how about
opening your head and looking at if
there's a group of people who are
killing it on education
and they become your boss maybe
you should look at yourself
maybe you should check your work right
if you've got a boss that's an albonian
because they all want to in school
and it was their biggest
priority
and it wasn't your priority
they should be your boss
you should have worked for albonians the
albonias are going to run your country
they're going to run your media they're
going to run your Hollywood they're
going to run your Tech they're going to
run every thing that matters why
because they went to school
is making me crazy all right
how is that not obvious
how is that not obvious
every one of you anti-semitic
you don't see that going to school is
the main variable
can you not see that seriously you can't
see that there's a correlation between
school and success
am I the first person to tell you that
like you've never heard that
before you never thought of it didn't
have that that thought yourself
how about it doesn't require any
collusion on behalf of Israel for the
people who took schooling as their top
priority
and then execute them
right now you're going to say but but
Scott they might be talking to each
other and preferring they're in group or
something yeah so what
so what
so what
you want you want to be on the end group
go to school
send your kids to school make it a
priority
all right
God that bugs me
all right back to back to the main topic
here
um do you think that AI will create work
for humans or reduce work
what's your
what's your best guess will AI create
work
um I I'm going to make a prediction that
it's going to be more like when we said
computers we're going to reduce paper
do you remember that the 70s early 80s
yeah all these computers are going to
reduce paper
the current market for computer printers
is about 50 billion dollars
I I remember when computers came in the
first big change was more paper
right because you had to print it twice
you know you may have to make copies and
everything so there's a story about uh
at least in some jobs there's one group
of people who are looking at uh
there's adding well I guess you'd say
they're examining articles to see what
would be included in their publication
and they got a big problem because it
used to be humans would write articles
they would submit them to their
publication they would look at them and
say oh okay and they'd pick the good
ones
now the number of articles that are
being submitted is shot through the roof
because they're being written by AI and
AI
can't write for so where they used
to have to look at you know maybe I'll
just pick up numbers these are I'm just
making this up where you might have to
look at let's say a few dozen human
written articles now you've got a
thousand articles that have been
submitted
written by AI just with a prompt you
know so nobody didn't work and they're
all bad so now they have to look through
a thousand to find that one where they
used to look through a few dozen that's
a very specific you know industry and
situation but I feel like there's going
to be a lot more of that
for example
if you said to me in the pre-ai world
I'm in my cubicle and boss comes in and
says Scott I need you to do this task
now in the old in the old days I would
have a certain set of tools and I'd go
work on that task
and maybe you know I wish I had AI
because I I would do it better so I
that's just the old way I just go work
in the task what's the new way
the new way is if I know that there's an
AI that could help me I'm gonna have to
research it and I'm going to have to
learn it and the way the current
architecture is you might need two or
three different AIS
for example you might need one AI that
creates a photograph that doesn't exist
you use a second AI to animate the
photograph into a 3D image
you might use a third AI
to add a script like a movie script to
animate it into an actual movie
you might use another app to clean up
the lighting and fix the sound
so you could end up with you know it
might take you a dozen AI apps
to do a thing
now people might be impressed by your
thing it might be great that you did the
thing
but all of your normal work you're gonna
have to pause and do a deep dive into
what AI can do and completely
re-architect your business process to do
the thing you will spend as much time
learning the tools
to do the thing as it would have taken
you just to do it the old way blah blah
now I'm not I'm not a troggle that I who
wants to stay with the old ways I'm Pro
AI you know let's do Ai and the market
will sort it out but I think it is
completely optimistic
to imagine it's not going to add work to
the cubicle class
as well as at home I think it will make
my life at home harder
because I'll be continuously trying to
find out what tool all right is it this
tool but somebody says this tool and got
to sign up and this one's not sending us
data to the other one and why is the the
API isn't working today and all the
things that used to be easy there'll be
so much better way to do it in this
complicated way that you have to spend
all your time figuring out how to do it
ordinary things that you did the other
way
now
in the long long long run is it going to
make everything better
Maybe
maybe and also in the long long long run
there could be fewer computer printers
we're I don't think we're there but
there could be you know at some point
there'll just always be a screen
everywhere so you really will never use
a piece of paper
but that might be a long time away
all right uh it was the hill is
reporting there was a survey that showed
that remote workers the ones working at
home some of the time
um are more more productive
do you believe that that the remote
workers are more productive
how do you think they uh measured that
just guess I I decided not to read the
article I read the headline
well how do you think they measure the
productivity of somebody working at home
versus the office
would it be I don't know
impossible
putting it out there is that one of
those things that might be
impossible to measure
yes it is yes it is it is impossible to
measure so who do you think might have
been behind this result that the remote
workers are so much more
effective
could it be I don't know
maybe people who work at home did the
survey
maybe when you ask people who work at
home and prefer it if they're more more
effective they say
yeah
yeah I totally am
do you work more hours
sure
and when you work those hours and you're
distracting atmosphere with your dog and
your kids and everything are you are you
focusing better at home oh yeah
oh yeah it's only way better it was way
better write that down
write that down a way better focus and
oh so many more hours weekends sometimes
I'm up all night sometimes the work is
so appealing I just can't stop
do I need to tell you that this
certainly is
I don't really need to tell you that do
I I wouldn't believe anything of this
domain now I'm not saying it's not true
I'm not saying that I'm saying You
couldn't possibly couldn't possibly have
accurate information this is sort of
like measuring the temperature of the
world
every time every time somebody says they
measure the temperature of the whole
world the average
I just laugh
do you know why I was born in the real
world in the real world you can't
measure the temperature of the earth and
compare it to last year that's no thing
who thinks that's a thing
who thinks you can do that with well
obviously with thermometers the
satellite stuff might be a little closer
to something that's real but who thinks
the thermometers
put all over the Earth are giving you
some kind of a good answer
that's ridiculous do I have to be a
scientist to know that you can't measure
the temperature of the Earth
all right the fact that anybody believes
that
uh apparently the American Workforce is
coming back strong a lot of people in
the 25 to 54 year age you're heading the
market
is that a good thing or a bad thing way
more people are entering the lady
marketings so they do have openings and
more people are going in this is the
Wall Street Journal who reported this is
that a good thing or a bad thing
do you think it would help or hurt the
competence of the economy
lots more people going to work
I think it's good
which people didn't have a job already
the competent people are the incompetent
which ones were already employed
do it were employers mostly preferring
the incompetent well the highly capable
people who were just sitting it out but
now they've decided this would be a good
time to go back to work I don't think so
I think the capable people already had
jobs
and that the employers are lowering
their standards to fill positions just
like the military is Right military is
doing the same thing so wouldn't you say
that this good news that the labor force
is really strong and people are going
back into it is that as good as it
sounds
I mean it's good that they get paychecks
so it's good for the economy but if
you're looking at the competence of the
country
it should take it down would you agree
that that seems like a cause and effect
of bringing in people who are not
already well employed
all right I'm going to give you a little
story before I talk about Americans
incompetence problem in a little more
detail uh I've got a friend who when he
was 16 years old and he's in my age
range so this was long ago when he was
16. his father owned a bowling alley and
then his father got a you know a better
offer better job at a big Corporation
so rather than closing or selling the
bowling alley uh the 16 year old was
asked if he wanted to just manage the
bowling alley just run the company
u16.
so remember this is many years ago so
what did the 16 year old say who
basically had been running the company
anyway he was like assistant manager he
just got running it anyway
you said sure
sure so it was a whole business you know
bowling alley
that was managed by a 16 year old kid
now in my day in my day when I was a
Youngster that wasn't that unusual
yeah and if you went back into you know
old timey times you know back in the
Prairie
yeah a 16 year old with the head of the
household
it wasn't that unusual
but do you think a 16 year old should
run a company in 2023
I mean there might be some special ones
but it's different
things look really different now
uh I could I I believe I could have run
a company of 16. back in those days you
know things were simpler too but I think
I could have I felt I was I was ready it
wouldn't have been easy but I could have
figured it down as I went I could have
gotten there
now compare that to the design of
America at the moment I'm going to read
a bunch of statements that just tell me
if you think these are true or false and
do they contribute to the incompetence
of the country
so my thesis here is that we have a
current design for our country that
guarantees incompetence and we didn't
always
we used to have a design that guaranteed
that the competent people would rise and
you know take over everything
but here's our current situation we've
got the teachers union blocking school
choice
should that make us more capable or less
capable over time less right because
competition is the only thing that makes
anything work and they're getting rid of
it
and they also maintain teachers who are
not good they're hard to fire because
the union protects them
so certainly the teachers union should
make us all stupid by Design I don't see
any way around it
another one affirmative action
do you think affirmative action causes
companies who would obviously prefer to
have highly qualified employees but also
diverse that's what they prefer
but unfortunately they have to deal with
math
which is they can't all get qualified
people because there just aren't enough
it's just numbers
so if you can't get enough but you're
being measured on your diversity
even more than your profits what are you
going to do you can start lowering your
standards which has nothing to do with
the capabilities of any group right this
is not about bigotry this is just math
that if you lower your standards because
it's the only way you can fill your
spots
you get less qualified people
that's there's no argument there that's
a strict definition of cause and effect
um how about a
tight job market well with lower
standards we talked about that how about
the fact that in 2023 the media the
scientists and the experts in general
are all lying to us
I don't know how different that is from
the past maybe we just know more about
it but do you think we're getting Dumber
because we're lied to by all the smart
people
I feel like that has an effect
right so I I just gave you the story of
you know probably the smartest person in
Congress Thomas Massey
you might literally like if you gave an
IQ test it might be number one
and then John Kerry is no slouch right
you might disagree with him but he's not
dumb he's a real smart guy super smart
guy
those super smart guys
were arguing about CO2 a million years
ago
like it mattered
like I feel like this is somehow
Downstream from all the experts
stupidity that even smart people are
dragged into
kind of a conversation that doesn't make
sense
um
how about uh the fact that we have lots
of college and lots of people going to
college but we have lots of college
courses that don't make you smart
does college make you smart
it used to I'm pretty sure it used to
and there are a lot of college majors
you know if you pick the right major
yeah totally it'll make you smarter but
I feel like there's a whole bunch of
college majors they're actually designed
to make you dumber
and that feels new
about a few more things that would make
us Dumber we've got uh
uh a lot of the smart people are
retiring
what about just retirement do you think
we're losing skills because the Boomers
the Boomers tend to have a wide range of
skills they tend to be Talent stackers
I don't know if that's still true so
maybe we're losing stuff to retirements
um and and there's also a bubble you
know since the Boomers were a big bubble
just the fact that Boomers had a lot of
training and that the group with the
most training is also the group that's
most retiring
again it's just math there's no opinion
here the math requires that you have
less qualified people when you're done
with those retirements
how about uh startups sucking all the
smart people into areas that by their
nature
neither 10 are going to fail
well it's probably great for startups
because you want your smart people in
the startups
but don't you think the startup
um the startup world is now so large
that you can suck the best people out of
every corporation
so when the startup world is small you
know it can be your smartest people but
you still have plenty of smart people
just doing their regular jobs but what
happens when all of the smartest people
realize that they could be billionaires
if they just do a startup and then nine
out of 10 fail
so you take your smartest people from
environments and where most of the time
they're succeeding
you put them into a startup
you know situation where by its nature
nine out of 10 fail you're basically
putting your smartest people into
failure
and taking them out of success
now I don't know if that's a net bad or
good because those smartest people are
creating you know Google and apple and
you know stuff like that so it might
come out positive but it's at least one
of those things I look at that might be
sucking Talent out of places we need it
all right so you put this all together
and I there might be something that's
making us smarter
but I can't think of it the best I could
come up with is that you can get online
training
for just everything
but that only applies to people who are
willing to go get it right it doesn't it
doesn't come to you you got to say all
right I'm going to learn this new thing
and then you got to really work at it
so it seems to me that we have designed
the system accidentally
so design is the wrong word but we've
drifted into a system that guarantees
growing incompetence yeah you can throw
drugs in there and and addiction
everything yeah it actually addiction is
a good one let's throw Addiction in
there I think there's more addiction so
that should take something off your
capability as well
and also Health what about General
Health
nobody's as smart or as productive if
they have bad Health but our food system
is killing us and our big Pharma is you
know doing a mixed job so we're making
people less effective by their health
less effective in their education less
effective in their training less
effective by filtering you know actually
preferring less qualified people because
you gotta you gotta fill these spots now
what is there anything that all of these
forces have in common
it's like a whole bunch of things I just
talked about making us less capable but
Israeli like core like bottom thing
that's causing us all because I heard
some people say it's obviously the
Communists
um is Communists so it might be other
countries trying to influence us but
it's the local marxists and the
Communists are doing it do you think
that's what's happening
all right I'm going to give you uh my
hypothesis
is women
it's women
it's all caused by women
now when I say it's all caused by women
do I mean that every single hold on let
me take a break
why do you mean every single woman is
exactly the same
well Dale that's that's not what I mean
and anybody with good reading
comprehension or has lived in the world
for more than a second knows that when
people talk about groups they never
ever ever
mean every person in that group is the
same
so why are you saying they're all the
same okay again I didn't really say that
I'm just talking in the normal way that
people talk when they talk about the
average of a group it's more about an
average sort of situation and yet you
say everyone is the same
Dale can you look at the calendar for me
certainly
what's today
July 24th
what season is that
summer
so
are you pretending to be angry about
something that you know isn't true
because it's the summer
and it's just summer news baby
Dale
go back to where you came from gladly
and pause all right so here's what I
mean
here's what I don't mean I don't mean
there's anything wrong with women
can I can I put that out there there's
nothing wrong with women
women are great
and there's nothing wrong with
individual women
individual wound I'm a big fan
I I can show you plenty of individual
women who are just killing it in the
workplace killing it in life
killing it with their families
awesome people I like women
however
it is generally true if we can stay
under the trans
conversation for a moment
if you will can I have permission to
talk about something that's not related
to trans
anybody is that okay I don't know if is
it legal
it's still legal right I can I can talk
about a topic without even referencing
is it like trans is not Central to the
topic okay
well I had to check
all right so here's what I say about
difference between men and women men
have more testosterone
thank you
that's not true what about the trans
shut up Dale shut up we're not doing
trans today
men have more testosterone
if you if you take a bunch of people
with more testosterone be they trans or
be they not
are they more likely to develop systems
that focus on competition
compared to a control group of people
with less testosterone
what do you think do you think that the
testosterone group if they were creating
a system would make them competitive
such as the free market
such as democracy and voting
of course I think they would and would
that mean that those people who had more
testosterone are they the Smart Ones
no I'm not saying that I'm saying that
if you pump anybody with testosterone
they make different decisions than if
they have less testosterone it has
nothing to do with your brain is
literally a chemical
that you had nothing to do with it well
maybe you boosted it somehow but
it's just a chemical all right now the
second question
if you had a group that you were
studying that you knew were lower
testosterone what would be the nature
and let's say that they had you know
female chemistry
what is the nature of systems that
they're likely to build
would they be competitive systems you
know Doggy Dog Winner Takes all
or are they more likely to be a sharing
communal kind of a situation where no
one is Left Behind
well I mean you know the answer right
don't you yeah and is there anything
wrong with a Cooperative system that
leaves every leaves nobody behind it
sounds great
it's exactly how you want your family to
work right yeah you want your family to
work that way that is a family frame
you're not going to let the weakest
child die
right you take care of your whole family
but
if you take these two groups who are
individually and as a group awesome
so let's say that women are awesome
individually and as a group
and let's just be charitable here and
say that men are awesome individually
and as a group nobody's better nobody's
worse but one group has more
testosterone
and that predicts
I believe I believe it predicts a set of
actions in general again not every
person but in general and I believe that
everything we're seeing of this growing
incompetence in America and I'll just
read you the list again all right as I
read you the list ask yourself this
if only men had been involved would they
have designed these systems
so you got the teachers unions run by a
woman very dominated by women
you've got affirmative action which I'm
sure has more women promoting it than
men at least really caring because women
would be more benef benefiting
uh the the job market that takes care of
itself how about the media science and
experts lying I don't think that has to
do with women
I I would say that I wouldn't blame that
anyone how about uh useless college
classes
the only reason that useless college
classes exist is that people sign up for
them and they pay for them
who is signing up for the useless
college classes the non-stem cell
women okay
um and again that's an average it's not
meant to represent any one woman the
people retiring that's just happening on
its own and uh
startups apps also yeah so some of these
are just some of these are just an
effect of where we are in the economy
but others are clearly
clearly uh because women dominate policy
do you think that's a true statement
that women dominate policy
I think it's guaranteed by the nature of
men and women
that women would eventually would
Dominate and the reason is that a lot of
these questions are kind of close
you know the reason that there's any
conversation at all is that reasonable
people can disagree
on what to do
but you know what reasonable people have
a hard time doing
pissing off women
pissing off women
if you put me in a situation where I'm
just analyzing you know the risks and
rewards and which one's better and
there's no outside force I probably get
the right answer more than not you know
oh this one's better than this one but
if you put on top of it can you analyze
these two forces but let me tell you in
advance that if you decide that one of
these is better than the others and it's
the wrong one you're going to be
canceled
because women
because women exist right which one am I
going to choose
I'm going to choose the web the one that
doesn't get me canceled doesn't give me
a fight when I go home right women are
very influential
without having
let's say
power on paper
PJ says God is terrified of powerful
women yeah that's what I'm saying I'm
terrified of powerful woman
laughs
I'm going to use upj as an example of
the declining competence in the United
States that was not a let's say A Plus
comment
I'm not sure it was a B minus
that was sort of that D Plus
barely represented uh human
communication
do better do better
Stefan says in all capital letters I
would bet my left nut this guy is single
big surprise because I don't
have to go home to a wife and explain
what I did on a live stream today
that's why I'm telling you the truth
because I don't have to go
explain it to a woman when I'm done
do you think I would have done this live
stream when I was married
oh you poor bastards who can't say what
you want to say
I'm
I just want to make you jealous for a
moment
I don't like to brag
but I'm canceled
and single
yeah same time I'm canceled and I'm
single
I can say any thing I want
and I'm rich
I can say any thing I want to
anyone
well unless somebody might beat me up
so I think you should sit there in the
silent
jealousy
that I have that thing you crave the
ability to say what I want
yes I think that
that the political power of women
is destroying the country
and I'm not sure I would even change it
because who wants to take political
power away from you know citizens of the
United States
I don't have a solution
if you're telling me but Scott are you
saying going back to the old ways where
you know women were property of the men
no
I don't have a good idea I literally
don't have a better idea I'm just
describing the current situation if
you're trying to understand why we are
where we are
maybe you understand it better
I'd love to see somebody come up with a
solution
I would say that one solution is Vivek
right Vivek ramaswamy is saying directly
strongly clearly and with a good
argument I'm going to get rid of
affirmative action
because it's uh counterproductive
for everybody
and so that's the solution
so I get I guess I would promote that
and I am I am backing him so
um but it's important to understand it
you don't have to get mad at each other
for that
all right uh I saw a tweet by Kenna Anna
who said in her tweet it still shocks me
that the quote educated class is the
easiest manipulated class
do you know who knew that that the most
educated or the easiest to manipulate
well hypnotists and magicians have known
it forever
so have fraudulent psychics
I remember the amazing Randy
amazing Randy a magician who used to
debunk you know frauds
and he was famous for saying that it was
easier to fool a scientist than a an
average person
because the average person is not
confident in what they know
so they'll look at something and say I
don't know that looks sketchy to me I
don't know the details but it looks
sketchy to me you fool a scientist with
a magic trick and the scientists will
say something like this well I can see
no way that that could be a trick so
probably you're talking to Spirits
right so in other words you can be
trapped by your own discipline and say
all right well I've considered every
possibility that's not talking to the
dad
and here's the dead talking to me so I'm
gonna have to rule out all the other
possibilities because I can think of no
hypothesis that would would be an
alternative hypothesis given all the
controls that you put on here you know
given the fact that I got to check the
room and you know given the fact that I
really really made sure there was no
magic trick and then those ghosts were
talking I heard it with my own ears so I
have to conclude from a scientific
perspective having totally controlled
the environment and then seen the
results of the experiment I have to
conclude that the dad do talk to us and
I saw it myself
now you take you take a non-scientist
and put them in that same situation
and they're sitting in the room and the
psyche is like oh your grandmother is
talking to you
and the ordinary person says
I don't have time for this
seriously and they get up and they walk
out
because the ordinary person is just
going to say I don't really have to do a
lot of research on this
it looks like that's
it's kind of like what a lot of you did
with the uh with the the pandemic
I think it's It's the funniest thing
that the experts got everything wrong
I mean it feels like the experts just
got everything and the non-experts got a
lot right not everything probably but a
lot and what were the non-experts what
was the the rigor that the non-experts
were putting into it
so
you're telling me that this is the only
virus in the history of humanity
that does not give you natural immunity
just this one
huh
and at the same time that the virus
doesn't give you natural immunity which
is weird
uh there's a Pharma company that spun up
a solution in one year after saying it
couldn't be done in 30.
one plus one
that's uh okay I'm not very smart but
he got the one plus the one
I think that's two
and that was that was like the public
and the scientists were saying but but
what about that randomized controlled
trial paid for by the people who want
the answer to come out one way what
about that
so you can see that the scientists were
trapped in their professions right they
had to use the tools of their profession
to understand reality and the tools of
their profession were corrupted by the
other people in their profession
so they used corrupted tools you know
the study using the data that was bad
and then they had great confidence
because their entire their entire life
would be meaningless and their life
would be ridiculous if they had been
scientists in a world where studies
don't mean anything
right you the scientists can't live in a
world where they realize they've
dedicated their whole life
to a field in which the data just
doesn't mean anything
so therefore when scientists were
presented with data you know of course
they checked to make sure it was
peer-reviewed and stuff like that they
said well it's probably convincing
because it's data
so there is a reason there is a reason
that the professional class is the
easiest to fool
now if you said to me I want you to
discover some new information that
nobody knew before
I would talk to the scientists
I would not talk to the average person
would you agree
discovering new things yeah let the
experts work on that they're going to
get there faster than I am by guessing
but once they come up with their you
know their Solutions and their policies
and you know here's what we ought to do
that's when the public is really
you know a little bit curious oh so you
haven't discovered a new thing rather
you've discovered that this thing this
thing called the virus is the only thing
that doesn't give you natural immunity
all right that biased nature
that should not have been incredible
all right
uh RFK Jr uh I love what he's saying so
much I'm just going to read it to you uh
can I can I go with a great tweet of
this but it's from RFK Jr quote
um
the White House had deployed an army of
federal agencies including the CIA FBI
DHS and IRS and many others to threaten
Facebook Google and Twitter with
withdrawing their section 230 immunity
which is an existential threat
so yes we had free speech
but you had the agencies of the
government telling the the platforms for
our free speech that if they didn't
restrict our free speech they would lose
their section 230 immunity which would
allow them to be sued for misinformation
on their platforms so they would be out
of business pretty quickly
all right so
so RFK Jr Paints the picture
where the government does use this trick
of threatening the 230
status of the platforms to make the
platforms be their all right so
we now have a very direct and documented
connection of the government making the
platforms that are
about the Free Speech there's no
question about that now right everybody
agrees
that is established as a fact the
government used threat and coercion
to turn the platforms into their Bishops
to make them do what they wanted now the
platforms if you looked at the
communications it sort of looks like the
platforms are happy to do it
it looks like they also have an
incentive to get rid of Bad actors they
also would like to have no Chinese
trolls on their platform so there's you
know the Venn diagram of what's good for
the platform
and what's good for the country is
pretty extensive right neither the
platform nor the country wants China to
be influencing your opinions on on
social media but
when it gets to that Free Speech part
that's where we go different directions
public wants free speech
government might think there are some
cases where that's a bad idea and so
they threaten the platforms effectively
they create a way to squelch speech
without being looking like the bad guys
because you can't you don't see their
fingerprints until all this
documentation comes out
all right so RFK Junior goes on those
companies cannot exist without immunity
that's that section 230 thing and they
were told that if they did not censor
the president's opponents and critics of
these policies they would lose that
immunity
um I'm editing a little bit but then he
goes on with the intelligence agencies
many of them although not all of them
are now serving the purpose of enriching
the military-industrial complex and
expanding its power for some military
contractors
here's the kill shot
my uncle
JFK my uncle recognized that the
function of the CIA had devolved into
providing the military-industrial
complex with a constant pipeline of new
Wars in order to enrich military
contractors and expand the power of the
intelligence apparatus
that's so well said
wow and then he ends with my primary
platform is unraveling the War Machine
and the National Security State that is
bankrupting and destroying the middle
class my God he tied it to the middle
class and he made it work in our country
the ultimate objective is to protect
democracy and restore the American
middle class
 is good
he's just so good
these Kennedys could just do this
can't they
the Kennedys are they just have the gift
to gather or something
but I haven't seen anybody ever tie the
the
military-industrial complex to the
decline of the middle class but you can
see it
you can see it you your your brain
connects them as soon as he says it it's
just brilliant now
I'll say again
RFK Jr
and I'll throw desensis in there too
super capable we're so we're so lucky
that they exist
all right along those lines I saw a
tweet saying that BlackRock was going to
make a trillion dollars rebuilding
Ukraine
after after the military-industrial
complex and their backers made a
trillion dollars destroying Ukraine
that our economy is literally designed
to destroy countries for profit and then
rebuild them for profit with that profit
coming from the taxpayers in the middle
class
sure feels like it
no I don't know how much of that is
intentional but this is one of those
cases and I usually don't say this I
usually say that we just got here
because the variables you know turned
the way they did I usually don't go for
the conspiracy theory
but it's hard for me to look at Iraq
in Afghanistan
and Ukraine
and imagine that this isn't true
it looks exactly like what's happening
it looks like the the intelligence
agencies start a war
that didn't need to be started
and then the military contractors clean
up they destroy the country and then
when you're done another group of
bastards make money from the taxpayers
to clean it up
yeah
so could RFK Jr actually uh change that
situation probably not without getting
assassinated
you know I I didn't want to go go there
but he is really on he's on the hottest
third rail of all third rails there is
no third rail that's hotter than this
one and he's standing on it with both
feet and shouting
he's basically saying shoot me
and
the balls on these Kennedys
I saw Bill Maher try to bait RFK Jr into
talking about Bill's theory that the
Kennedys do risky things they do
dangerous stuff you know both for
entertainment and in their and then
their professional lives
well I mean RFK Jr is the perfect
example of that his entire career before
now was doing really dangerous stuff
going up against big Pharma
how dangerous is it to go up against big
Pharma well he found out he got is
canceled as a canceled person could be
and he went from canceled to running for
president
so instead of running away he ran at it
like like the pill box is like tearing
them apart
and he's running at the pill box where
they had grenades saying well we'll see
how this ends
basically to me it looks like it's me or
you I he's not saying these words but
RFK Jr to me he says he it looks like he
said I'm gonna die I'm gonna die doing
this
I think he just offered his life
and seriously I think he seriously
offered his life
and I think that if he got assassinated
doing this
he would die happy if it meant that we
understood the problem and then maybe
did something about it
I don't know this is the kind of
patriotism I don't think I have ever
seen
I'm trying to see if there's this is the
highest level of pure patriotism I've
ever witnessed now I would say that
Trump is up there too you know Trump may
have some you know other things going on
but I think Trump is a patriot and I
think that his possibly you know maybe
his co-biggest incentive other than
you might want to be president I think
his co-biggest this incentive is that
he's a patriot and he took on enormous
risk
I mean the size of the risk that Trump
took on to enter politics at that level
you've got to appreciate the risk he
took
that's the Patriots
that's the real thing
so to have two of those in the race
two people who I would say literally put
their life on the line
to make America better
literally put their life on the line
now I think Vivek is is a patriot at the
highest level as well he doesn't have
the same risk that these two had but boy
does he have a risk to you know he's
lucky that he already you know cashed
down his company so he got rid of his
company risk
by his reputational risk is Extreme
extreme
so these are people who are really
putting they're laying it down for the
country
somebody said on uh on Twitter today
that I'm too pessimistic and I think
maybe on Twitter it looks that way
because the things I tweet tend to be
about problems
but I'm not that way I'm actually very
optimistic I think there are things
happening right now in the world that
are tremendous and this is right at the
top of the list
this is the best field of candidates in
my lifetime
I'm not saying there isn't wasn't you
know maybe you like Reagan or something
but for a field of candidates
this is really impressive
all right
um new way of making fake news this is
also also an RFK Junior story the ties
to method if you want to smear somebody
you say they have ties to something
unsavory
so this is what uh who did this to RFK
JR this was uh
some illegitimate publication
some investigative journalists I forget
who it was was it uh
Rolling Stone
somebody will tell me look at the
comments but anyway
um
so RFK Jr was accused of having ties to
the Ultra Mega Republicans
having ties to them because I would
smear him because he has ties to the bad
guys do you know what the ties were
do you have any idea what those close
ties were looks like in some contexts
they use the same accounting firm
they used the same accounting firm
that was the close tie
so whenever you hear this somebody has
ties to something
your your antenna should go up and go oh
well that's fake news that's fake news
now if they had said
um he's working with and he's making
policy with maybe you know who knows but
if they say his organization has ties to
this unsavory group
fake news should be your first instinct
and then it the article better work
pretty hard to talk you out of it
they had the same accounts so RFK Jr is
uh he says I interrupt my normal Tweed
stream for a bit of Comedy it's so
ridiculous
he goes uh blah blah blah Rolling Stone
yeah Rolling Stone and Congressional
Democrats are irate about a Kennedy
Super PAC having quote ties to Mega
Republicans
actually the quote ties are that are
hired an accounting firm that has also
done accounting for other packs
including including those of Republicans
shocking isn't it I hope they continue
this bold investigative journalism they
might discover the Discover other ties
maybe they use the same janitorial
services too
I tell you mocking is the way to go
that mocking is the way to go so again
that was perfectly phrased
um
Jonathan Turley is writing about all the
Democrats who now want to over basically
ignore the rulings of the Supreme Court
because they don't like them
apparently there were two professors a
Harvard law professor and a SF State
University Professor they were calling
on Joe Biden
to defy the rulings of the Supreme Court
if he considers the rulings mistaken
can you believe that this even happened
that there are two College professors
one from Harvard
who are actually saying that the
President should ignore the Supreme
Court
you know the the whole basis for what
makes the Constitution work is the
separation of powers that you should
ignore the separation of powers the
single most important thing that keeps
the country together
the single most important thing and they
should endure it
and that's like a real thing I do I even
I don't need to tell you why it's a bad
idea right we can skip the whole counter
argument right agreed
will you all stipulate stipulate that
it's so stupid I don't have to say
anything about it
but apparently there are a number of
Democrats and other people who are
backing the same idea that if you don't
get what you want you can ignore the
Constitution
and they're talking about it out loud
in public like they're proud of it
how did we get here
is so dumb this is like they were never
they never learned how the Constitution
worked but I mean it's a Harvard law
professor
so
clearly they prefer the power over the
constitutional system
all right
speaking of Thomas Massey
um
he tweeted this
he said the Department of Homeland
services department Department of
Homeland what's the yes
Department of Homeland services
the S is for what security
Department of Homeland Security said
that misleading covid-19 narratives
inspired domestic terrorists
all right so the department homelands
security they're protecting us so this
is our government protecting us and
they're worried that misleading covert
information narratives would
make more domestic terrorists
so as Thomas Massey points out in his
tweet what were some of those examples
what were some of those so-called
narratives that were going to cause some
kind of domestic terrorism so we
listened natural immunity is real
vaccinations don't stop the spread
most masks don't work
most mess still work
I I love Thomas Massey he's the only one
smart enough to put the word most
the rest of you are like Mass don't work
and then then I have a heart attack I go
come on you can't say that's not an
absolute
you tell me if you wore your n95 for a
two-minute interaction with your 80 year
old grandmother it wouldn't give you
anything nothing at all
all right I'm anti-mask by the way very
anti-mask but I love that Massey is
smart enough to say most masks don't
work I would have added most Mass don't
work you know in 99 of situations but in
the in the the narrowest of situations
yeah maybe a little bit just not enough
to have the mandate
mandates are unconstitutional people
were saying and the virus came from the
Chinese lab so basically five examples
of things that the uh the conspiracy
theorists got right
and they're not random things
they're the five
most important things
aren't they aren't they literally the
most important things they got them all
right
just remember that
and how about this Rand Paul is tweeting
um
that the government quote science that's
right
a sitting senator
just put quotes
around the word science
and I have no argument with it
no argument at all
and he goes on government and science
published a study purporting that 90
reduction in Death from covid if
vaccines if you boost with a vaccine the
only problem the authors the study
failed to reveal that the uh I think he
has a typo here I think he means the
unboosted group also added 90 reduction
in deaths from all causes in other words
the patient group were not equal to
begin with and the booster vaccine may
or may not have had any effect
that's right
it might not have had
any effect
at least based on the data
and then Rand Paul goes on and goes this
insightful critique is exactly what the
FBI and Department of Homeland Security
have been attempting to censor
only this time it made it into the New
England Journal of Medicine
so the New England Journal medicine can
print that but all the all the other
people who said it was obvious they
couldn't say it I guess they didn't have
enough science backing them
but can you imagine
that the whole pretty much the whole uh
argument for boosting
came from people who couldn't read
science
they didn't know what the study did or
said it didn't know how to design it
right and even even the author of the
study said oops yeah you're right
imagine that the author of the study
once it was pointed out that it was a
ridiculous study
said oh yeah well that's true
and we set our policy on that
we determined our policy on that
are you ever going to trust another
study about anything
amazing
so
there's another competence problem
um and apparently the new news on Hunter
Biden is that uh I guess who's the
Archer
who is the Devin Archer was a partner
with Hunter Biden apparently he's going
to testify or already has that Hunter
Biden uh
participated in over two dozen calls in
which his father was on the call for
these businesses that Joe Biden says he
had no knowledge of
that's right there are 25 instances
or so 24 or so instances
of we have good information from Devin
Archer
that Joe Biden was on the calls
24 times ish and he said he had no idea
of what what his son was doing and that
they were just overtly you know selling
access
now of course Devin is facing jail
so I would want to be careful that he
didn't work out any kind of a deal
but I haven't heard that so you don't
want Devin Archer testifying about
anybody else if he's worked out a deal
because that means he might have an
incentive to lie
so I would be careful about that I would
be careful about anybody who's looking
at uh jail time for his own work talk
about anybody else
um but I guess we're going to hear about
that pretty soon
and then this question of whether Joe
Biden
fired the prosecutor who was looking
after the barisma stuff do you think
that Joe Biden fired him just to protect
uh Hunter and barisma
or did he fire him because the
International Community was asking him
to fire him because both were true
so apparently
apparently both were true
that it was true that the International
Community was asking for that same guy
to be fired
and it was also true that barisma's
Senior Management this is the new
information barisma's senior executive
at least one of them
very much wanted they actually tried and
is documented to get Hunter to use his
connections to get that guy fired
so I'm a little confused if the
International Community wanted this guy
fired that sounds like it's legitimate
and if
if Joe Biden did it for any reason at
all
but also the International Community
wanted it done for their good reasons
he's in the clear
at least on that
to me it wouldn't matter that there's
also somebody in the company who wanted
him gone because you know somebody in
the company wants them gone
and you know they would try to make it
happen if they could so I don't know how
to is it possible both are true
and what does that tell you it's true
that the International Community thought
the prosecutor was bad
but it may also be true that he's going
after somebody that you're protecting
so he could be bad but also doing
something that wasn't necessarily bad
for once
it's a little confusing I'm not sure
anything is going to hang on this
you know the the firing of the
prosecutor but it's very sketchy it's
very sketchy
all right that ladies and gentlemen
concludes what must be called
the best podcast you've ever oh
well that went pretty long all right I
didn't know I was going that long uh I I
have something blocking my clock I
normally don't do that because I'm
looking at a clock but there's something
in front of it today so sorry I went
long but I'm sure it was the exact thing
you needed today probably the best thing
you've ever seen in your life YouTube
thanks for joining I'll talk to you
tomorrow
