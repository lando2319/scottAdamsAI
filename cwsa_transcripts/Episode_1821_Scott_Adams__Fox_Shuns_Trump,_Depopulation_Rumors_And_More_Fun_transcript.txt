shall we
now you will be amazed at the following
thing that happens
watch me remember
the simultaneous sip introduction
all you need is a copper bucket a copper
mugger glass a tanker jealousy style a
canteen yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and
join me now
for the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip
go
all right well that was
close so let's talk about all the cool
things that are happening
here's something that makes me happy
there's an israeli food tech startup
called savory eat
that's making 3d printed pork patties
turkeys and burgers
um
youtube just keeps going on and off so
there's no point in continuing with that
hey youtube for some reason youtube just
keeps turning on and off
whereas the locals platform
let's see if i can even say this long
enough it's so unstable it gives me like
10 seconds shot
i'm going to shut down the youtube in a
moment but i wanted to tell them yeah
it's done
all right scott doesn't get paid today
that's what that means by the way
that means that
the monetization for
for today's show is off not that that
matters a lot but yes you did pay that's
true
you are now my only
audience
that's right
i still have locals and that's all i
need
because if youtube had good technology
they'd be listening to me now
that's why you've been waiting for
finally
all right
so anyway this uh this is really a
startup
they can 3d print food
and they can make meat
now
don't you think they can make something
that tastes like vegetables
probably probably
and apparently it's you know who knows
how healthy it is and how many how many
chemical additives
are involved in it i don't know so i'm
not going to tell i'm not going to tell
you it's healthy or unhealthy
but i feel like this is the solution to
our food problems
and what i mean is food cost
could you imagine
could you imagine
a 3d printer in your kitchen that's your
only kitchen you know maybe you've got a
sink and garbage and stuff but basically
could you imagine only having a 3d
printer it could be like a replicator um
yeah it's basically it's a redneck
replicator
but
you know the thing i complained about is
how many times you have to pack and
unpack food
you know how many times does it change
hands food any kind of food before it
gets on this on the shelf
it goes through all kinds of processing
people and distributors and wholesalers
farmers
and then it gets to the grocery store
and then
you know somebody puts on the shelf i
put it in my cart my car on the thing
the thing in the car the car into the
counter the counter into the into yeah
basically it's like
probably 12 to 15 times it changes hands
or goes from one place to another to
stage it
wouldn't you say
don't you think food probably changes
states meaning it's it's in a place or
it's being shipped or it's being handled
probably 15 times
before it gets to you but imagine if the
only thing you had to receive
was the
fuel for your 3d printer
and you know once a week somebody comes
with a bunch of
basically
you know ink acceptance for your food
and you just print all your food
how awesome would that be
very awesome
all right
jon stewart apparently fell victim to
some fake news
are you watching that
yeah so jon stewart's been promoting the
uh
the burn build
compensation thing so the veterans who
uh apparently were injured by being
around these burn pits
um
john stewart is trying to get them
you know health care funding and stuff
and i guess that bill was defeated by
the gop and john stewart said oh you
guys voted for this exact bill
before you guys being the republicans
but now you say no
but the real story
the real story is it was a fake bill
it had it had poison pills and then
other spending they had nothing to do
with it so it was a bill designed to
screw republicans or fail
it only had two states
none of the states are the ones that
john stewart would want where there was
a clean bill
and people passed it like nothing like
that happened what happened was the
democrats made sure that it couldn't be
passed or if it did it would be bad for
the country
by throwing in some things that you know
effectively did not get through a
government process because they went
through the back door
so jon stewart falling for fake news
um
and you would think he would have
noticed that the news is fake
when i heard that the republicans turned
down the burn bill
or in other words
when i heard when i heard that the gop
was acting anti-veteran
what was my first thought
let's see i'm looking at the news
and the news is telling me that
republicans
are now supportive of veterans
what are the possible explanations for
why this news is what it is
one
republicans have completely changed who
they are overnight two
it's yet another example of democrats
playing that trick where they put a
poison pill into a legitimate bill
so that you can't vote on it like you
can't possibly approve it it's just so
ugly by the time you vote on it
so i'm going to say that
jon stewart is at least one level of
awareness below
me
and probably you
how many of you have the same same
experience when you saw the news
that the republicans had turned down
some kind of thing that was good for
veterans how many of you knew
it was fake news as soon as you saw it
yeah raise your hand all of you right
pretty much everybody who watches this
live stream knew that was fake news from
the jump and it's always fake news in
the same way
that they threw a poison bill in there
meaning they added some funding for
unrelated things that republicans don't
like
so
so do you do you suppose that jon
stewart is not
operating on a level of awareness
where he understands that this is fake
news
you're right he is
i don't know makes me wonder if jon
stewart was actually fooled by the news
or if he's pretending to be fooled
because
to make a point or something i'm not
sure
well let me ask you this would you say
collectively that joe biden has been
successful with major legislation
so here's a test to you to see if you
fell for fake news
let's see if you fell for fake news is
joe biden has he been successful
in large let's say major legislation
well here's what cnn's take was and one
opinion piece anyway
um joe president joe biden has scored
successes on issues such as
infrastructure and gun safety
so the you know you don't have to like
those bills but just in terms of are
they major
and are they big issues
yes and did he give some legislation
passed that he liked
apparently yes so infrastructure and gun
safety
now this is the democrat version right
uh and the chip spill the chip spill
um
i think it moves our chip manufacturing
back to the united states or promotes
promotes that
so that's good
so those are three pretty big things and
then he's got this
uh major climate bill that looks like
it's got a good chance of passing in the
senate as well that would be pretty
wouldn't that be pretty major
for one term that would be uh
for
fairly substantial bills
i know i i think they can make a
they could make a compelling case that
he's been successful
at least successful in terms of the
democratic initiatives
i'm not sure any of those bills are
useful
i have no idea if it's a waste of money
or not but at least he got what he said
he would get
uh chip is a fail because it doesn't
help yeah
most of these things have a a title of
the bill that is completely misleading
to what the bill is
so if you look at what the bill says it
is
what we really need is some kind of
truth
truth and labeling don't you think
we need a truth in labeling don't we
yeah because these bills are all labeled
the opposite of what they are
and the congress makes every other
product
put its ingredients on the label uh
you see where i'm going
congress should be forced to put its
ingredients on the label in other words
what's in the bill
including
you know how if you look at the
ingredients on that package
it will tell you the good stuff that's
in it
protein and vitamin d and stuff but it
also tells you that how much sugar and
fat
right
so it tells you it tells you what's good
and then it also in trans fat so it also
tells you what will be bad for you it's
right there in the package
why can't congress
and let me ask uh you know thomas massey
or uh you know
tom cotton
or somebody who's you know not worthless
how many people in matt gates
that's a perfect matt gates
topic isn't it
rand paul
so so those are the ones i think would
be capable
right matt gates could do it could do it
because he's got nothing to lose and it
would be hilarious
am i right
matt gates could do a truth and labeling
proposal
because he's got nothing to lose it'll
be awesome
you know he's the most dangerous
politician in the country right now you
know that right
matt gates by far is the most dangerous
in a good or bad way depending on your
point of view he's the most dangerous
because he can do anything now
he's been moved to the category of
people who are completely free
there's just no there's no constraints
on that guy anymore he has nothing to
lose
so
if you want somebody to tell the truth
in front of the country
you would hire him
because it looks like he's willing to do
that and literally nobody else is is
doing it
yeah what happened with matt gates do
you remember all that
alleged legal trouble that matt gates
was going to be in
where's that
do you remember that accuser
never heard from her did you
so so where is this witness
and obviously they would have it would
be easy to get digital
evidence of some crime right so anything
that matt gates did on email or whatever
they probably have that already
i don't see any do you see any charges
do you the was the matt gage thing
entirely
because it looks like it
it just disappeared
how do things just disappear
i mean it looks to me that that was all
fake
anyway i'd like to see maybe a thomas
massey or rand paul or matt gates or
somebody who's got some
you know gonads
say lauren beaubert
she has more balls than most of the
people in congress and i don't care who
it is but somebody just needs to do a
uh
somebody needs to do some kind of a
truth and labeling thing for the
legislation
right what is your belief about our
supply chain and our ports
yeah those are all good names what about
our supply chain and our ports
do you think they're getting better or
worse
i guess they got better in may and june
and i told you that problem might be
solved
but apparently they're they're backed up
again
yeah the report the reporting
disappeared but the reports are back up
but
um yeah it's worse it's worse on some
ports
there are some ports that don't seem to
be terribly impacted
ports owned by china
that's not true is it
is that true
that doesn't feel true
that the ports that are having trouble
have some chinese ownership i don't
think that's true is it
that doesn't sound right
all right
um here's what i wonder is it because
demand is so high
is our economy cooking so hard that we
just can't
deliver all the goods
it's incompetence you think
yeah
oh parts from china are delayed well but
that wouldn't affect the unloading of
the ships so i guess we've got some
question about the reporting on this
shipping supply chain here's the other
thing i don't know
don't you think that by now
and this is just speculation
and it's it's part of the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters
if you knew there was going to be a
long-term supply chain backlog
what ways would you adjust
i feel like the ways you would adjust is
you would unload the most important
ships first
am i right
because that normally i would imagine
this is just speculation i would imagine
the ships get unloaded first come first
serve
does that make sense
probably if everything is fast you just
do first come first serve but if you've
got an emergency and there's a backlog
i feel like the most important ones
probably go to the front of the line
what do you think
you know like if something has
microchips in it don't you think that
goes to the front of the line
perishables microchips
yeah so it could be that
we're not noticing the impact
because if you buy some consumer good it
takes two months instead of a week
but you know it's some little consumer
good it's a toaster
you know if you buy a toaster maybe it
takes a month to get it
but if you buy food it seems to be there
right so it could be that they're
they're doing the important stuff so we
don't really notice there's much
difference and i don't see any reporting
about you
why am i the first person
who is floating the notion
that they may have changed their
priorities at the port and completely
lessened the impact on the public
or they didn't which would be also a
gigantic story right
if the ports did nothing different
and all they did is suffer the problem
well i'd want to know about that
wouldn't you wouldn't you want to know
that they were doing nothing to help the
problem
so i don't know the total lack of
reporting on this is
kind of interesting
all right now here's a really
interesting situation brewing with trump
and
murdock
so my understanding is that various
murdoch-owned entities
they would include uh
the wall street journal and uh is it
which is it new york post or daily news
it's the new york post
which yeah new york post
all right and fox news
so the new york post and wall street
journal have both
uh at least reportedly
turned to anti-trump
can you confirm that that's true right
and and the reporting is and i don't
know how reliable this is right yeah i
wouldn't assume this is totally reliable
because it requires a little bit of mind
rating
but it sounds like the murdock family
father and you know lachlan probably the
ceo
seem to be anti-trump and the latest
reporting is that fox news
is shunning trump
now
the opinion people are still talking
about him
but the network is not having him on and
i think it didn't cover his last speech
which i don't think is a big deal
because he's not in office
but do you think that's true do you
think fox news is
going to shun trump
so it
yes or no
i feel like it's going to be a mix you
know one of the interesting things about
murdock
is he he does allow dissenting voices on
his platforms
like you know
i'm not talking about
slightly dissenting
murdoch does allow a lot of voices on
his
network now you could argue maybe more
or maybe maybe he's got his thumb on
stuff but i've always noticed that have
you
yeah
now full disclosure
um you know i've published books under
an entity at one point that was
murdoch
and
yeah i've sort of been associated with
that whole murdoch world
and
my uh my impression was they never tried
to censor me
at least in the publishing wing
uh fentanyl in the distribution i don't
know what that means
anyway
what happens if murdoch decides that
trump will not be president while trump
is deciding he's running and going to be
president
take a vote do you think that murdoch is
strong enough
to prevent trump from being president if
let's say he had the votes
you don't think so so most of you are
saying
we have some yeses
but it looks like the majority of you
maybe at least 75 percent
are saying
that you think trump would have more uh
power than murdoch
hard to say
i do think that
taking trump off the major platforms
would have an impact
you think he transcends media but you
still have to see him
right he's off of twitter if he if he's
off on twitter and off of fox news
or even reduced in fox news to like 50
how can he win
yeah because most of the country's not
on twitter
you know twitter is smallish if you look
at the whole country
youtube you know youtube
well keep an eye on that um i do think
murdock could keep trump out of office
so
you know i don't think it's a binary i
don't think you know you could say he
definitely would or definitely wouldn't
but i think
i think if murdoch is absolutely
set on trump not being president i think
he can prevent it
and what country does murdoch
what is he a citizen of uh
oh yeah
australia
australia right
so correct me if i'm wrong
but an australian will decide who's
president
am i wrong
it looks like that's the case because i
don't it seems to me that a republican
can only win if the republican machine
is strongly behind that candidate
i would think
and i don't see that the republican
machine would operate unless
murdoch is fully on board
yeah so i think we have another case
where a foreign entity is completely
controlling our
outcomes
there you go
why why would never talked about that
you
you never hear anybody talk about uh
an australian billionaire
controlling america because it kind of
it kind of happened didn't it
well we'll see
here's a typical cnn story this is from
yesterday i forgot to do it yesterday
so here's the headline
and then i'll tell you what the story is
so the headline says an entire north
carolina police department resigned
after a black woman town manager was
hired
and it gets worse
all of the people who resigned were
white
so the entire there were only eight of
them it was a small town but the entire
north carolina police department
resigned after a black woman
town manager was hired to be their their
boss basically
um so that's pretty bad huh
totally real news
oh let's let's dig into the details also
on cnn so i'm not going to any other
source i'm looking at their title and
now i'll look at the details
um
the evidence is that the
new boss
who happened to be a black woman
uh made them do a whole bunch of extra
work
compared to what they used to do
and they thought it was more than they
could handle and they'll quit
now the reason they quit was explicitly
specific things that she was doing
which even you could look at from the
outside in other words a crt
she was just making them do
way more than their normal job basically
or historically more than their normal
job
so it looked like it was just a a normal
work related thing
but then cnn throws in this
studies show people in organ
organizations often think now let's see
if you agree with this
racist opinion
studies show people in organizations
often think black women are more likely
to have angry personalities
with studies also suggesting that this
negative perception
is a unique occurrence for black women
so in other words black men do not have
this reputation
it's black women
so that's
that's what they studied so they studied
if people in corporations had a negative
impression
of the anger level
of black women and they threw that in
the story
now
so the title
suggests there's racism
and then the mention of the study
is basically talking about racism
except that the content of the story
doesn't involve any racism at all
it's a story about racism wrapped around
a story that doesn't have any racism in
it it's literally just some people quit
because their boss sucked
that's the only thing we know
look at that oh look at
would you like me to change the sky
possibly
possibly i have superpowers watch this
you see the sun behind me
watch this
expand
expand
yeah i'm making the sun bigger does it
feel warmer where you are
a lot of people don't think i can do
this
and now
sun back to your normal size
there we go there we go
i can do that again sun grow
now back to your normal size
yeah let's see don lemon do that
cannot do it all right so here was a
question that the harvard business
review didn't ask
the question they did ask is do
corporate people think
black women in particular
are angry or have angry personalities
and people said yes
you know what they didn't ask
is there a is there a question missing
or
it seems like they they may have
been doing a little uh
little thinking past the sale
is there a missing study
what would be the missing study that
would fill in the blanks
would the missing study be
maybe studying all the different kinds
of people and asking them directly
questions that would get to whether they
are angry
i'm just going to throw that out there
suppose you just surveyed everybody and
you develop some questions to determine
if each group was happy
or angry
based on their own input so not based on
anybody else's input because that would
be racist
but based on
their own opinion of themselves
what do you think you would find
would you find that any group had more
anger or angry personalities
well i don't know
i don't know
and let me ask you this if there were
any group in the united states
that had a good reason to have some
anger
can you think of a group
that has more like legitimate reasons to
be pissed off
they do
now you might argue
that everybody should you know feel the
same and be treated the same
but if you uh
i would imagine if you were a black
woman you have a few things to complain
about
overall i mean not every person we're
not making any i'm not making any
blanket statements about people i'm just
saying that if you were to study
averages and that's what this harvard
business review did is study the average
opinion
of the corporation so we're always
talking about the average right it's not
about any individual
um let me ask you a bunch of racists um
if you've ever done telephone support
calls where you call in to get tech
support or customer service you've
probably had the experience of getting a
variety of people
answering the phone
do you have the racist opinion
that black women who do customer service
have angry personalities go
how racist are you
lots of no's some yeses
mostly no's
yes is no now remember we're not talking
about each person obviously each person
is unique we all agree on that
but do you see any patterns
no
interesting so you're all over the place
um i don't know
here's what i think
i think that
i've said this before
everybody uses the power that's given to
them
that's a general statement you'd
probably agree with right if somebody
has a lot of money
that's a form of power and they'd
probably use it
in ways that increase their power
um and
and if people have let's say physical
power
like they're big intimidating people
usually male well say you're like a big
intimidating person like
larry ellison or
you know something like that i've heard
that some large males
are just physically intimidating
and so that's sort of a power that they
can wield over people
so generally speaking
when people have power they use it
wouldn't you say
is it fair to say that if you have a
power you use it
on average
so one power that women have that men
don't have
is that they can go hard at men
without worrying about um consequences
now of course there's exceptions and
abusive men and stuff so certainly there
are women who can't complain without
getting you know getting beaten up so
we're not talking about that but
generally in your average
marriage
the woman can be a total
and get away with it because men will be
like ugh i don't want to deal with a
divorce losing my children
yes she's a total there's nothing
i can do about it there's absolutely
nothing i can do about it then the woman
says well i could be a total
and nobody's gonna change any of my
situation
i'm mad so i'll be a total
so generally speaking women have a power
that men don't have which is a certain
kind of complaining
you know men can complain too
but it's not going to make any
difference
when women complain it's more likely to
have some effect right especially in
relationships
now
now add on top of that
uh you know any cultural impact and it
seems to me that some groups
would just have more power to complain
and everybody uses their power
so
you could make a case again this is just
you know racist speculation probably
but wouldn't you imagine that black
women have the most power to complain
let me just put that out there would a
black woman have the most power in
society
to complain
i would say yes
because they would be considered among
the most um discriminated against group
you know you got your black you got your
woman you put them together
you you know you have a reason
to have some uh you know baby attitude
so
if somebody has a really good reason for
being the way they are it shouldn't be a
surprise that they're that way everybody
uses the power they have if
if i had the power
of being able to complain about my
victimhood and it got me stuff
i'd probably do it
if that's just the way i could get stuff
now it turns out that it wouldn't work
for me
you know as a white guy i can complain
all day about
racism against me
well it doesn't work
so so let me say that again the only the
only reason that i'm not an angry
personality
and i'm not complaining and bitching and
abusing people every time i have a
conversation because i can't get away
with it
that's it
if i could get away with being an
 i probably would drift in that
direction
and most people would
you drift in the direction of your own
power so
if you happen to be the group that can
complain the most
and other people say yeah i can see why
you would complain the most
well
well you can understand how that
situation might evolve but again if
you're dealing with anecdotal evidence
there's no there's no evidence that
black women are more angry personalities
in my opinion there's only evidence that
people believe it
let me say that again
there's no evidence that black women are
angry personalities
that i'm aware of i haven't seen any
study that says that this study said
that people think it's true
which is completely different
oh all right here's my favorite story uh
there were two big game hunters lawrence
and bianca rudolph and they've been
shooting big animals in africa for years
they're both in their 60s i think
but
in 2016 they
were going to try to get a leopard i
guess the wife wanted to shoot a leopard
and she was out hunting all day and did
not shoot any leopards she shot a number
of other animals but no leopard
but then when they got back to the cabin
when the husband was in a different room
he says
there was a
shotgun went off and it killed the wife
so she was found dead now the husband
lawrence rudolph
he's charged with murder
but he says that you know the gun went
off by accident now
i haven't looked into the details of the
story but here's here's how i'd have
handled it
first of all the top suspects would be
the leopards themselves
so uh there were no witnesses and we
know that the leopards had a had a
motive
so if i were the leopards i would have
tried to send his squad of leopards
in to shoot this woman and maybe save
the other leopards
if i were the investigators
once i came upon the crime scene
probably what they did is the way they
usually handle it you know they clean it
up take pictures do what they can
but i would have waited a week
um
just to see if the husband mounted her
head on the wall
because that would be
evidence of intent
that's just me
but you know if you found your head on
the wall a week later i'd say i feel i
feel like i know what happened now
that explains a lot
um i would like to add on top of that uh
normally i do not talk about tragic
situations that happen to individuals
but if your hobby is shooting mammals
and you get your own head blown off i
don't really care
i don't really care at all
oh yeah if the shotgun blow was in the
head then we could eliminate the husband
because he wouldn't have a trophy
so that would be evidence too um so let
me be as clear as possible if you shoot
large mammals for fun i don't
care what happens to you
i don't care at all i don't care if he
got shot in the back of the head i don't
care i don't care if you suffered and
died i don't care if the elephants stomp
on you i don't care if the leopards eat
you
if that's your hobby
it's your own problem right i
don't care i've no sympathy whatsoever
for bianca rudolph she can go to
hell and rot
uh i don't normally say that about
people have tragic accidents but
uh especially especially if they might
have been murdered
i usually don't i usually don't condemn
the victim but this victim
 dale
chicken she can rot
all right that's just my opinion
um how many of you think that
i don't democrats and liberals want to
depopulate the world
you think the democrats want to
depopulate the world
do you think bill gates wants to
depopulate the world
here is what i think everybody gets
wrong
there there's nobody smart enough to be
playing at that level
at the bill gates level
let's say imagine the people who are at
that level you think are trying to
depopulate the world
so in your opinion you might put bill
gates there
you know klaus whatever his name is
schwab right so all these people but
these are the well-informed
elites what do you say soros yeah so you
would put them in that category of
people that you believe
want to depopulate the world
correct
now how do you explain that those
billionaires
think that we're better off with
less population
but elon musk who's also very smart and
a billionaire says that it's essential
to have a growing population it's not
just optional it's essential
you need a growing population or else
you're really in trouble
so how could these other billionaires
like klaus schwab and gates how could
they be so wrong
if if musk is right or vice versa
let me tell you what i'm pretty sure is
true
so without without knowing i'm going to
make the following assertion
that musk and gates agree on population
and here's what i mean by that i believe
that everybody smart thinks that
population has to grow
to to have a healthy world
let me say it again
i believe that everybody above a certain
level of awareness and intelligence
everybody everybody 100
above a certain level of awareness
understands that we need a growing
population
everybody below that level of awareness
could be you know
any opinion
but above a certain level of knowledge
and education everybody knows it has to
grow
and bill gates is above that level as is
clef schwab as are all the elites
there are no elites who think the world
needs to have less population
you can't find any who say that
none
you will find lots of people who think
population growth
needs
bill bill maher is not somebody i would
consider well informed on this topic
bill maher
continuously makes economic
assumptions that i think are under
informed
i think that's his weakest
weakest spot now i have a very positive
opinion of bill maher
as a
public personality and person who talks
about the news and and in my opinion
with the exception of trump commentary
that he's he's clearly biased that's a
little bit personal
but generally speaking
he's telling you his actual opinion it's
not
but i don't think he has enough
understanding of economics
to be good in that realm
so when he has an economic opinion it's
generally not one i would look to now if
you put bill maher in the room with
either elon musk
or bill gates
do you think that
bill maher is operating at the same
level of awareness and understanding of
the world
i don't
i don't think it's even close
yeah if you did an economics test
of bill maher versus bill gates let's
say it's just a standardized test
understanding economic principles
bill gates would get every question
right
like every question
he would understand everything about
economics at least that would be put on
the test
bill maher
would get a
he'd probably get a 75
75 right but that 25 percent he missed
is a big deal
you know and that's the part i seem to
notice when when he's got a gap in his
understanding so yes there are some
people at a lower level of understanding
the world who think that we might be
better off with fewer people
but what the thing that you're
conflating
that makes you think that the smart
people who understand economics are also
agreeing with bill maher here's what's
confusing you
they do want to control the population
they do so bill gates definitely
wants individuals to have control over
their own
reproduction which might have the effect
of lessening it in some places
so they want people to control it
but there's no way that bill gates wants
the population of the world to shrink
would anybody like to make a bet on that
would anybody like to make a bet that
you will never see a bill gates quote
and that none exists there's no bill
gates quote about reducing the
population of the whole world
so you'll take that back
now remember
the bet is that
the bet is that you believe he wants
fewer people i'm saying he wants the the
growth rate
to be more managed
so so so he wants more but at a more
manageable way and
you know that
it makes sense for the country right
yeah
all right
um
yes and bill maher doesn't understand
how technology will improve resource
management and musk does that is exactly
correct
exactly
right
um
yeah i know i know it causes a lot of
trouble when i defend bill gates but but
keep in mind that i don't defend bill
gates for a love of bill gates
whatever he's done in his personal or
professional life yeah that's up to him
to explain that's not up to me
what i what i try to work on is how we
think about it
so i'm not defending bill gates i'm
defending
um accurate
thinking
and i believe that accurate thinking
says there's no evidence that anybody as
smart as him
would ever be on the side of population
reduction
so let me generalize it i'm going to
generalize it from the bill gates
because he just he confuses the question
because you have so many opinions about
him
nobody nobody who understands economics
and technology let's put it that way
nobody has a good understanding of both
economics and technology
believes that the population should be
reduced
find me one example and i'll change my
mind it's got somebody prominent that
you could clearly say okay this person
does understand economics and does
understand business does understand
people
you know does understand all that
killer
well hitler's not ex if hitler's the
best example you have
well let me correct you hitler did not
hitler did not believe in population
reduction
he he believed in reducing some kind of
people and increasing the kind of people
he is so even hitler isn't a good
example
and even
and china is an example of controlled
population
china wasn't trying to uh was trying to
not have runaway population growth but
they didn't want it to be negative too
hard
right they wanted to slow it until they
could
handle it
which is what they did so now they've
increased the number of kids you can
have
so
yeah they and and by china reducing
their
uh their growth rate they may have
killed themselves in the long run
because they've got this demographic
bomb
though now
do you understand why you have to have
more people
because you can't have a growing number
of old people who don't work
and a shrinking number of new people who
do
that that leads you to a bad situation
yeah yeah japan has that problem too so
we don't want the problem of japan and
of china
but the united states never had an
overpopulation problem so we didn't have
to deal with that
yeah i do think more old people work
that is part of the solution definitely
all right um do you think china will
shoot down pelosi's plane
uh gordon chang
gordon chang thinks it's possible where
he said that
it's not possible
yeah um
i i'm the biggest china hawk
probably that you've ever seen
and even i don't think they'll shoot
down nancy pelosi's jet
tie one on yeah
all right
uh yeah i don't think that's happened
i'm not gonna worry about it
all right that
is the slow news day news
do you have any interesting questions
does it look like africa yes i'm
intentionally obscuring my face like a
like a
witness protection
have i ever talked to penn gillette
about trump
um
i i didn't get to meet and talk to penn
gillette i don't think we ever talked
about trump no
gym encounter i did not see your post
about a gym encounter
uh
russell brandt oh i i did give russell
brand's producer some
uh dates for scheduling but i haven't
heard back or at least i have to check
back
oh i forgot about co
biden getting covered the second times
if if you're keeping score
biden has four vaccinations and two
covent infections
so the score is uh vaccinations four
covet two
but i think covet can come from behind
and maybe
maybe soon we'll have more infections
than there are vaccinations
now how many of you uh accept the
following logic
that if the vaccinations and
youtube if you're watching don't cancel
me over this wait until i get to the end
and you'll be happy
how many people think the following
logic
holds and it goes like this
if the vaccinations don't stop you from
getting it
and they don't stop you from getting it
a second time
um
and it doesn't stop you from
transmitting it
then it doesn't work
yes or no
if it doesn't stop you from getting it
doesn't stop you from transmitting it
um it doesn't work
somebody says not as a vaccine okay fair
enough
define work okay
you know you really this this group is i
think the most sophisticated audience
watching the news honestly because i i
thought there would be a few more of you
agreeing with that and it makes no sense
right
if you know that it's
reducing the severity of infection
then you would have to make an argument
that the
the side effects from the vaccination
are worse
than however much it saves you now i
don't know if that's true
now if you said to me i don't believe
the studies
and i don't believe that you're reducing
more
more problem than you're causing with
any side effects
i don't know that we can believe that
oh they think did i ask the question
wrong so it looks like they're agreeing
to the wrong thing
maybe
well
the discussion that matters is long
covered
and whether the vaccination anecdotal
information is telling you i think
all right here's a question i asked just
before i got on and we'll see how they i
did a little poll
let's see how it did so we'll see how
you do on this poll
so i did this just before i got out here
so i didn't see any answers yet
and the answers are
so i said this what does it mean when
they're what does it mean so you get to
interpret this
what does it mean when there's a
mountain of anecdotal evidence on
twitter
that shots the vaccination shots
allegedly caused dozens of different
medical problems now here's the
important part
not medical problems
but dozens of different ones
so if you were a doctor how would you
process that
it's anecdotal so it's not a study
but there seemed to be a lot of them on
twitter anyway
but of course twitter is everybody
in the world so you know there are a lot
of people that they could notice
um do you think do you think they've
seen that there are dozens of different
medical problems
that people are associating with the
shot whether it's proven or not people
are saying that
is it a red flag for danger that there
are so many reports
would you say it's near proof of danger
you've seen so many of them that in your
mind is nearly proof
not just a red flag
or do you think it's more evidence of a
probable mass hysteria
or do you think that it's literally
nothing
that that the fact that there are lots
of anecdotal reports
uh one of the answers could be that it
literally means nothing because
anecdotal is just anecdotal which which
of those would you say
it's a red flag for danger it's near
proof of danger probable mass hysteria
or literally nothing
go
danger noise uh red flag nothing nothing
nothing
uh
only one person said only a few of you
are saying hysteria okay
so most of you are saying either nothing
or a red flag
you know my ques i realize my question
sucks because something could be nothing
in a red flag at the same time can it
right
it can be nothing
and also a red flag
so i so i'm going to add together the
red flag for danger and the literally
nothings
and that would be 78 percent
of the people answered it
and i think that would be it's correct
to put the red flag
and the literally nothing together
because you've literally proven nothing
but it can still be a red flag of
something to look for right
only 10 said probable mass hysteria and
that is my vote
my vote is probable mass hysteria
do you know why a mass hysteria works
because only 10 percent of the people
recognize it
that's what this is exactly what it
looks like
when i here was the uh here should have
been the tip off
the mass hysteria is the probable
explanation
there are too many medical problems
being attributed to the vaccinations
if you told me there are three medical
problems that we're seeing all over the
place it's the same three
then i say whoa that's a red flag not
proof
not near
just proof
red flag look into it
but if you tell me that there are dozens
and dozens of different medical problems
after the shots
immediately my mind says
that's more
that's closer to the arc of a mass
hysteria
but it could be complicated
because it could be a red flag
plus a mass hysteria
it could be both
because within the dozens and dozens of
medical problems people are reporting
there are some that are dominant right
the myocardial digest the although the
myocarditis usually clears up
but let's say fertility
you know some impact on that
there probably is a top three that you
really should worry about uh in terms of
a red flag not in terms of proof we
don't have that
but to me this looks like at least
at least half mass hysteria
so whether or not the vaccinations so
let me summarize this as cleanly as
possible because it's easy to get
mischaracterized when you do this kind
of topic
my opinion is
it's probably a mix
all these anecdotal reports are probably
a mix
of real red flags
meaning you really ought to take it
seriously
but most of it is mass hysteria
and easily identifiable as so
easily identifiable
in my opinion the mass hysteria part's
obvious
right which does not mean you're wrong
okay can you handle that nuance
if i tell you that most of what you're
seeing in the anecdotal reports are just
mass hysteria
can you accept that that could be true
at the same time
at the same time
there might be enough of these reports
that are true
that you need to take it seriously
right but
i figure probably there are only a few
conditions that look credible and
probably there are a whole bunch of
other things that are just coincidence
and that's the coincidence part is the
mass hysteria part
how do you identify mass hysteria um the
clue
is how many different explanations or
or problems there are
yeah i'm intentionally keeping the
the camera in a terrible mode because
i've got this injury on my lip that
looks like monkey pox but isn't
no it's not a herpes or i know you're
gonna say that
i literally burned myself very badly in
my lip
um
is robert
malone correct
i doubt it
if i had to place a bet on dr malone
being correct on let's say most of his
biggest claims i bet against him and i'd
feel pretty confident about that if you
said against everything
that malone says that's different from
what the mainstream says i wouldn't take
that back
i i would i would agree with you
it's almost certainly true
that some of the things malone is saying
are valid
but i think he goes too far
um i call him rogue to discredit him
yeah i do call the rogue doctors rogue
to discredit them
but what i'm doing is discrediting i'm
discrediting the category
for your benefit
so if i take a specific doctor and say
that uh they're presenting themselves as
a rogue doctor i do mean i do mean
intentionally for you to reduce your
belief in them
that's the point
doesn't mean they're wrong
if you take that as i believe that my
medical information is better than
theirs and you should treat them as
wrong that's not what i'm saying
i'm saying that if you don't if you're
not a doctor and you can't check it
yourself
and the only thing you know is that
there's a rogue doctor who differs from
the mainstream
you're probably bet on the mainstream
the smart money says the mainstream is
right not the rogue doctor
you only think the rogue doctors are
credible
because you only hear about the ones
that got it right
uh follow the money scott doctors have
little or nothing to gain really
really
you don't think dr malone got some
speaking the
invitations
you don't think he monetized that
you know the other thing you have to
look at is that
malone presents himself as a narcissist
and i'm not going to say that's bad
because i am one and there are two types
one type of narcissist wants to just
destroy everything you know destroy
their social situation the other kind
just likes to get credit for doing good
stuff
in my opinion
malone looks like a narcissist
meaning that his payoff is having people
believe he was right all along and that
that would be worth any economic
degradation that he they experienced
so if he's financially secure
then his payoff would be what they call
the fuel
people saying you're right
malone you were right all along now if
it turns out later that he's right he'll
make a fortune
do you get that
if you say well
he he sacrificed so much
to be a rogue
i say no he invested so much to be a
rogue
if his if his investment pays off and it
turns out he's right
he's gonna have like a speaking career
books
he will make
i would say the value of dr malone being
right in the end if it turns out that
way
would probably be 20 million dollars
if i had to monetize
the value of him being right in the end
it would be about 20 million dollars
because he'd sell a book they'd go on
the speaking circuit
and he probably i don't know if he
practices but if he practices medicine
all the smart people would say i'm going
to go to you because you've got
everything right
does that make him wrong no i don't know
if he's right or wrong
how would i know so i can't give you an
opinion whether he's right or wrong i
can tell you what it looks like
he's in the category that's usually
wrong
doesn't mean he's wrong but he's in a
category that's usually wrong
and he acts like
he presents himself as a narcissist
again that's subjective
but i've seen enough of them and it
takes one to no one right like nobody's
more narcissistic than i am
but i'm also transparent
i'm transparent in the sense that if i
don't do something that's worthwhile to
you
well i don't want any credit
but if i do
and i do something that helps yeah i'd
like you to mention it because that
would feel good to me and maybe i'll do
some more stuff for you
it just works it's just a virtuous cycle
i give you something you give me
something that i want
i want different stuff than you want
that's a perfect situation if we wanted
the same stuff it might be a problem
but if but if i want credit
and you want some benefit that i can
help you get well we both win
that's cool so i don't i don't care that
he's
he might in my opinion have that
personality trait that i have
that part's fine
how is that not mind reading
that is statistical
assumptions short of mind reading
mind reading would say i know what he's
thinking
i don't say that
i say to me
he looks like
me
so if i were to say well if he looks
like me he's probably like me that's my
speculation so i always put
anything that is somebody else's
thoughts
into the speculative
road
using rogue is persuasion
yes i am intentionally persuading you to
think that he's less credible that he
presents himself
i'm not i'm not
i'm not trying not to do that i'm doing
that very intentionally very openly
i am i'm trying to encourage you
to put less credibility on anybody who
differs from the mainstream in a way you
want to hear
maybe that's the thing i should have
said
all right here's the better way to say i
finally figured out how to say this
this took me forever i finally figured
out how to communicate this
don't believe people
who are a little too close to what you
want to be true
those are the least credible people if
they disagree with the mainstream
if you disagree with the mainstream
and it's exactly what you wanted to hear
it's right on the nose
the odds of that being true or low
or low
it doesn't mean he's not right but the
odds are low
here's god describes himself
being a yeah that's exactly true so
somebody says that
i'm describing myself let's see if
that's true
uh i disagree with the mainstream
and i tell you things often they're
exactly what you want to hear
yeah that's true
that's true
so
what i do in public
is i make predictions and
statements and then you get to test them
so you'll get to see if it's true like
anything that i tell you
usually you just get to see for yourself
right
so if i told you that you know biden
would be problematic as a president
well you get to say yourself
was i right or was i wrong and and i
keep score
you know i i literally gave myself a
score card after the pandemic here's
what i said here's how it turned out and
i included the things i got wrong
now if malone does that
let's say
five years from now and we've got a
better idea
everything else if malone does that and
says here's the stuff i said
i got a couple things wrong but here are
the things i got right
instantly he would go right to the top
of my credibility list
right
he would go right to the top of my
credibility list if he kept track of his
own statements and how he got them right
or wrong
and then you know gave you an honest
accounting at the end then then
then i would write lift them up a little
bit
malone is clearly right on myocarditis
as the cdc data is showing the trend now
he might be right in that but the
myocarditis as i understand it
clears up
and that um
uh
yeah so the myocardius is not so much a
question of whether you get it because i
think we've known that for a long time
it's a question of whether
how bad that is in the long run
makes a difference to you compared to
any protection you get from the shop
cardiac cells can't repair i don't think
it's a cardiac cell problem
but covet also causes myocarditis
somebody says right
i'm afraid of longer but my but
myocarditis no biggie
um isn't myocarditis part of long covert
i'd put that in the same category right
if you get if you get some kind of
condition
there are cardiac stem cells so i think
the doctor is telling us that
the heart can repair itself
what is the definition of long covet
yeah that's a good question
in my opinion it's anything that um
continues to bother you after you had a
covenant that's related to the covenant
so i would think that if he had
myocarditis and it was it lasted i don't
even know if that could happen can
myocarditis
just continue
i don't know
about anything that bothers you after i
would call long covet
whether it's temporary or permanent
all right
do folks in upstate new york haunted
deer yes they do
yes they do
yeah my parents were hunters
they both were deer hunters
you know
i do have a different opinion of people
who eat the meat and
you know in in upstate new york
you could make an argument for
conservation i mean it's kind of a crazy
argument you have to shoot the deer to
protect the deer but there really would
be too many deer
that's there's no joke
if the deer were not
somehow population controlled and i'm
not saying that's the best way to do it
but
uh
there would be
yeah either you'd have to introduce
wolves and then you're still killing
deer
yeah there's no right answer there's no
right answer but at least if you're
eating the venison and we did i ate a
lot of medicine
but if you eat the venison it's
at least not as ethically
disgusting
um
yeah
reintroducing wolves to yellowstone
fixed
deer will destroy a place yeah the deer
will eat your crops
all right
i think that's all for now
i believe we've done our job
i believe that i will talk to you
tomorrow
