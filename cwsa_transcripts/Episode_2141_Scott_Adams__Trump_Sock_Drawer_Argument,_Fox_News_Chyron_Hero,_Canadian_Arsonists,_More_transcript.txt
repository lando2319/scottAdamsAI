good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I don't know why the Ancients didn't
think of it but here it is now lucky
think of it
millions of years of human evolution and
you happen to be alive
at the same time as a simultaneous sip
if you'd like to participate all you
need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker chalices Diana canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee enjoy
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine even the day the thing that
makes everything better is called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
for those of you in a different time
zone
just wait
59 minutes and you'll be ready
[Applause]
all right
here's some stories this one's sort of a
repeat but I like it so much I'm going
to tell you
researchers at MIT
have developed this absorbent
hydrogel have you heard this story
an absorbent hydrogel
and what it does is it sucks moisture
out of the out of the air
so you could put this hydrogel in the
desert and it would create drinking
water it just sits there now here's the
the gray part I believe it's infinitely
reusable
it doesn't wear out it doesn't get
waterlogged it just continues sucking
water out of the air and then you have
clean water
now
what would happen to the world oh and
also apparently it's easy to mass
produce it
did we just solve the entire water
problem of the world except maybe for
agriculture
but would this allow
will this allow people to live on the
ocean
because this isn't the biggest problem
of living in the ocean getting getting
water right you'd use a lot of energy to
desalinate so if you didn't need to use
any of your energy to desalinate
could you not live on the ocean on a big
old barge
it really could change everything the
the entire nature of how human beings
live in the world could be changed by
this little hydrogel because now you're
not bound by Water Supplies humans have
been bound by water
access to water forever
what if we're free to that
interesting interesting thought imagine
that at the same time as Fusion
right because it always takes 10 years
for anything to get big but I suppose we
had Fusion Energy
effectively almost free and infinite at
the same time we had free and infinite
water
two things the civilization needs the
most to thrive
there are some really good things coming
until AI kills us all of course I mean
that's coming by the way in the Dilbert
reborn comic that you can only see if
you're a subscriber on Twitter to my
Twitter feed or if you're on the locals
platform
scottadams.locals.com you would see that
Dilbert's CEO is now testifying to
Congress about the dangers of their AI
product
so if you want to see Dilbert's CEO
testifying to Congress about the dangers
of AI
that's how you do it
all right
apparently these Canadian wildfires
uh seem to have been set by arsonists
and a appeal it appears they have an
ongoing
Canadian arson problem
and of course the question is is
somebody paying these people
are they are they environmentalists who
are kind of warped and they think this
will make people do something about
climate change because the news is
covering it as a climate change story
it doesn't even seem a little bit like a
climate change story seems like a giant
arson story
but do you think the individuals just
sort of wake up one day and a bunch of
completely different people say you know
well it'd be fun
has anybody ever thought of burning down
a forest and then they go and do it
well I
there's something going on and it might
be just a psychological effect
uh I don't necessarily see a Grand
Chinese plot behind any of it but maybe
I mean if I were China and I were trying
to destroy North America
I would do it with matches
so I don't know if they've figured that
out yet
but they will
well Joe Rogan sort of a you know his
importance in our uh Society continues
and I feel like he's
calling a top
you know I've done this before but
nobody's believing me yet so I'll just
keep saying until it's true
uh that wokeness like everything else
has a limit
and I think we reached our wokeness
limit
and the way that you can tell is that
people could say aloud things you
couldn't say even a year ago
you could just say it
here's what uh Joe Rogan said he said he
would vote for Trump over Biden because
Biden's you know mentally gone basically
and uh and Biden's cabinet is a quote
 Sideshow of diversity
it's people you wouldn't hire to run a
Ben and Jerry's
now
how long ago was it was it one year ago
that you wouldn't see somebody like Joe
Rogan
say they would vote for Trump first of
all
is that news
that feels like news
that he would say write out loud no
ambiguity if it's those two I'm going to
vote for Trump because one of them
doesn't have a brain
I don't think you could say that a year
ago
but he says it you know without uh any
anything held back but then he goes
after the diversity hires in the cabinet
is it only because he's Joe Rogan that
he can say that
could the rest of us say that diversity
hires are destroying the country
by the way I I have no reason to believe
they are I I don't have any special
knowledge that these cabinet members are
worse than other cabinet members I mean
I always think cabinet members are just
clowns anyway
does anybody take cabinet members
seriously
you know maybe a secretary of state then
you're then you're done right
but haven't we don't we have a long
history of putting uh political cronies
and cabinet positions I mean is is Pete
Buda judge the you know cabinet head of
Transportation
because of all of his Transportation
experience or is it just like it always
is
you know that everybody's just getting
their little rewards and stuff
yeah so I I would uh I would challenge
Joe Rogan on the basic question of
whether we've ever had competent cabinet
members Beyond Secretary of State we
probably do pretty good with State and
maybe energy but after that I think it's
just political stuff
so but anyway the point is now so much
about the cabinet the point is more that
Joe Rogan can say that out loud and I
believe there will be no penalty
I believe there will be no penalty for
what anything you said about that what
do you think
do you think a corner has been turned
and I think the uh
the individuals stealing the dresses
from the airport probably had a lot to
do with how people feel about the
cabinet and Buddha judges
you know had some some issues
I don't know that Buddha judge is doing
a bad job by the way I wouldn't know how
would anybody know you know there were a
few high-profile things where people
said
he went to Palestine and he wore his
good shoes
everybody should know not to wear your
good shoes to the disaster Zone
all right
okay
is a gay guy with good Footwear
are we really holding that against him
a gay guy with good Footwear
okay I mean if that's the worst you have
I'm not going to worry too much about
his performance
anyway I'm not saying he's doing a good
job I'm saying we can't tell
is that clear I'm not supporting him I'm
just saying how would you know if he's
doing a good or bad job the stuff that's
in the news is also propaganda as you
can't really tell if he's doing a good
or bad job you really can't
all right uh
Joe Rogan also had uh well I have one
more question when Joe Rogan said that
Ben Jerry's
uh that the cabinet members couldn't run
a Ben and Jerry's uh somebody tweeted
that Ben Jerry's is so woke they're
Burlington Vermont Flagship scoop shop
has a we must a dismantle white
supremacy sign in the window
so you get your ice cream and your
politics in the same place we must
dismantle white supremacy
now I have a question
for Ben Jerry's
do they still sell vanilla
anybody
that's actually a real question
do they sell vanilla
they knew I'm gonna have to see it
because I don't believe you
I don't believe they sell vanilla ice
cream
all right well I'm gonna have to see
proof I don't believe it
I think they got to dismantle that stuff
well uh so Joe Rogan also had RFK Jr on
and he asked him directly this is why we
love Joe Rogan right has anybody asked
this question directly of RFK Jr which
is are you afraid you'll get
assassinated
as somebody must have asked the question
but I feel like most people would be too
afraid to ask it even though it's the
main question on our minds is the one
everybody's thinking about and so Joe
Rogan just asked the question are you
afraid basically yeah you've said the
Intel people killed
Gilda JFK are you afraid they'll do it
to you
and he said he's not afraid but he does
take precaution
what kind of precaution could you take
does he have a food taster already
I mean how much could you actually do if
the CIA wanted to kill you
do you think you could block them
you know the CIA is trying to kill me
but
I got me a ring doorbell
so I feel like I'm pretty good shape
here
what exactly could you do yeah I guess
Castro did it you'd have to have body
doubles
I think you need about 35 body doubles
just to get your odds down to normal
all right we know more about my new hero
I call him the uh Fox News Chiron guy
because we don't know his name
and you know the story that the Fox News
Chiron guy put up a little
label at the bottom of the Fox news
report when Trump was being reigned they
said wannabe dictator arrest political
rival
[Laughter]
now I speculated and hoped it was more
hoping than speculating that it was done
as a parody of seeing that in MSNBC
because that's sort of like a parody of
their coverage
and it turns out I don't think it was a
parody although it could have also been
a parody right but that wasn't the main
purpose apparently uh so so this is what
I heard from
you know and as somebody who has access
to knowledge right uh and I don't know
if it's true just I I'm just telling you
what I was told
so you could put whatever level of
credibility on that you want
um and by the way this was not from any
employee of Fox News so so what I'm
going to tell you comes from a non-fox
news person
but the story is that when uh Tucker
quiet allegedly management asks people
to take sides and they said if you're on
Tucker's side
tell us and we'll walk you out now
and I think some people did and they got
walked out or potentially they did I
don't know the details
this one uh this one Fox Fox News Chiron
hero
is allegedly one of Tucker's
ex-producers
that doesn't get more interesting now
yeah now I'm telling you my source is
not a Fox News employee I know you're
gonna guess it's not him
um
and
so apparently this senior Fox News
producer uh stayed long enough to
figure out what was going on and you
know maybe collect some information and
uh apparently this was his his final act
before he left
so while technically he was fired
apparently that was the plan
so it looks like he was trying to get
fired and he was he was done with the
with the network and he went out in
style now I happen to be a really big
fan
of resigning in in a spectacular fashion
very big fan of that
and so the fact that he did this play on
his way out he will always be my hero I
I so want to know his name or her name
I'm not I'm assuming a gender I
shouldn't be doing that so he or her
I would like to know who this is because
that's my new hero
I absolutely want to be this person's
friend I want to be their friend
that's it anybody who could do this is
my friend
I don't care what else is going on
so that's fun
uh did you see Matt Walsh's Twitter
thread
about what Fox News is uh
teaching its employees about pride month
I I don't even know how to describe it
but apparently the required Fox News
propaganda for their own employees about
pride month is just jaw dropping
I don't even know how to describe it
it's it it's hard not to call it insane
right it looks so far beyond you know
what any reasonable person would think
is appropriate in any situation and I'm
not being a prude
right I'm not I'm not saying you know
straight sex is good and gay sex is bad
nothing like that nothing like that you
know among adults whatever whatever but
uh
how did such a small group of people
end up with so much control over our
lives
is such a small group of people
why are there problems greater than
every other category on Earth
like you don't think fat people and sick
people and you know people with
different abilities and you know you
don't think there's like a million
categories of people with issues
or special let's say not issues well
let's say special situations it's like
you you can slice you know the
population up into a million different
aggrieved groups and they would all have
a point every one of them would have a
point
and if you listen to it you say well
it's a pretty good point
but why but why is one group
the only one that we have to look about
look at it and care about and have a
month and
how many months are there
so we know we got Black History Month
but I think I think we got that one
honestly
wouldn't you say Black History Month
I mean there was slavery
like I feel like the country came on
that one honestly meaning yeah we should
we should note that we you don't want to
forget that but pride month
and again this is nothing against the
lgbtq community which I am a big
supporter of
I love my lgbtqs but
why does anybody need a month
again like I said slavery is the special
case
ah
well
it says it's an interesting situation
and no doubt we're reaching the peak of
it
all right here's a story that I swear to
God is like Groundhog Day every time I
think this story has already been
reported
I I learned that it wasn't exactly
can anybody give me a groundhog day
kind of a clarification here
how many times have we been told that we
found out that the lab leak that the
virus really did come from the Wuhan lab
am I wrong that every few months I wake
up to the same story as if we didn't
know but now we just learned it
I thought we didn't know and then just
learned it at least six different times
how many times do we have to like
pretend we didn't know and then just
found out
and now there's another one
now this is the worst of all right and I
think Natalie B and Michael
schellenberger are on this case doing
the research and another person whose
name I tragically forget so there's
somebody else who needs credit that I
just forgot their name
um but apparently the first three people
infected with the virus were employees
of the lab
wait
what what
the first three people infected were
employees of the
we're going to infect you with a virus
lab
how long have we known this
how long have we known that
and then part of the reporting is that
you know uh FBI director Christopher Ray
said
that they've known for a long time it
was the lab
that the FBI has known for a long time
did we know that I mean but
just give me a
just give me a fact check have we not
gone through the cycle of not knowing
and then knowing like six times
how many times do we have to find out
once again it really was the Wuhan lab I
don't know what's going on here I'm
actually confused about why we ever
thought it wasn't them
Whoever thought it wasn't
you know I've told you the story that uh
uh before you'd ever before you haven't
heard there was a lab
I already knew it was the lab have I
told you that story before you ever knew
there was a lab there
I had privately in a private
conversation
seen the uh Seed where the lab was and
where the wet let where the wet Market
was is like right across the street
and the name of it like I think Garfield
has said this and I think John Stewart
has said this
um that hasn't the name is like right on
the door you know the the Infectious
Disease lab or whatever
and the day that somebody showed that to
me I look on the lab and I thought
well that's not a Coincidence of
course it came from there so I knew I
knew that before and trust me
everybody in the government probably
knew
from day one
because all they had to do is know where
the lab was and that was the end of the
story you all you needed to know is
where the lab was that's it and then you
would know the whole story
and it turns out it was exactly what it
looked like
all right let me talk about the uh
Mar-A-Lago documents and the sock drawer
defense
and
I've been trying to figure out the two
movies on one screen
you're aware of one movie that says
Trump will definitely be cleared of all
charges because the Clinton sock drawer
case
basically sets a precedent that he can
take what he wants
you've heard that right
and then
I see tweets from the left that say
those people who believe that are
hallucinating and stupid and and they're
silly
but I never saw a reason
like everybody would just say you're
you're stupid you're silly and I'm like
and and it doesn't why does the sock
drawer defense not work because can you
give me any reasons so I had to do a
deep dive today in the fake fact
checking world of PolitiFact and all
those places and of course
all of the top search results if you
Google it all of the top search results
say the sock drawer defense is
did you know that
do you know if you Google it all the top
results say it's
but do you know why
this is a this will be attest to your
bubble and by the way I'm very guilty of
this so so I'm doing my Mia culpa here
so I actually believed some of the
things I heard about those sock door
defense
none of it's true
did you know that the whole sock jar
thing is complete
how many of you do that
I'm going to tell you why in a moment
first of all that the sock drawer was
not about the government versus Bill
Clinton did you know that
I thought the government
had an issue with Bill Clinton and then
the courts worked it out and then Bill
Clinton was shown to be right because
simply by taking the the stuff that was
good enough to say it was personal so so
there you go so you can just take
anything he wants and it applies to
Trump too all right so the first thing
that you need to know is it was never
the government against Clinton
it was Judicial Watch
private organization they were suing to
try to get access to the private tapes
under the theory that they weren't
private
but then the court said there's nobody
whose job it is to decide what's private
or not and therefore the court cannot
decide that they are or are not private
I I just ruined that explanation totally
but about let's see the summary that
is a private organization wanted access
to the tapes and the court says we don't
really have any control over that
so no
um but that has nothing to do with the
Trump situation
so here's where I was getting confused
by all the defenses and the claims all
right and I think I'll bet most of you
are confused about the same thing and
this clarification might be the first
time you understand what's going on
maybe that's my so my goal is that this
will be the first time you understand
what's going on because the two bubbles
are not talking right there is no
there's almost no contact whatsoever
and I also saw the Wall Street Journal
article where the lawyer who lost the
Clinton sock drawer case
said oh yeah I'm the expert on this
situation I lost the case trying to get
access to them and so I can tell you for
sure that Trump is not in trouble
because I'm an expert in this very thing
however
that expert is a partisan and so when
the expert says I know everything about
this and here's my opinion you're
getting a very partisan opinion all
right this is not somebody who's trying
to tell you
you know the FL the full situation
now that's not fair of me I'm just I'm
just making that assumption based on
association with an entity that has a
you know a definite political place in
the world right they're they're not
trying to be objective in my opinion
um you know they have more of a
political agenda
so
here's the big clarification
there are two issues not one
one issue is how does the president
declare that something is personal
personal is different than confidential
so there are two paths and this is why
we're confused One path is about what is
classified and how do you make it
unclassified that is a separate question
from what is personal
does that make sense
so the standard for the sock drawer case
was about what was personal
it was about what was personal
the Clinton situation is about what was
classified
those are not the same
so a stock drawer case gives you not
only does it give you no precedent but
apparently from a legal standpoint it's
not a it's not a binding precedent if
binding is the right word it's not a
precedent that any Court needs to look
at you know nobody needs to look at that
as a president
so there is no precedent that has an
illegal weight there there is just
something that happened which is
different and
so here's here's what I think is that
the fact of it
um
a president can can yeah all right so
here's my best understanding a president
can make any document unclassified
but not personal
so so Trump does have the right I
believe
to declassify anything because he's the
president
and that his argument might be and I
think this would be the the better part
of the argument that the act of removing
it is a clear indication of
declassification
now he might win that and he might not
but I think that's a strong argument
that the mere removing of them is a
clear intention to declassify
you know maybe a jury buys that maybe
not but I can't see 12 people
not agree
I mean maybe a mixed jury but I can't
see 12 people saying no he doesn't have
that capability you're right however
here's my understanding that I need a
fact check on
even if something's personal
it's not necessarily owned by the
president
This Is Where It gets weird
so apparently on day one uh when when a
material is presented or created you're
supposed to designate it personal orbit
or government on day one
right so if you do that everything goes
well and that and there's no there's no
problem later on day one we said this
was personal we filled out the form
it's been personal from day one so then
that's fine you can keep that
but what if there's something that
didn't get classified that way as
personal
and then later on
the president wants to claim it as
personal because hey just look at it
just look at it these are obviously
personal
right so then who gets to decide
well the question I think Judicial Watch
wanted the Court's design and the courts
basically said that's not their job
and there's no standard for that so
I think I'm butchering the legal
descriptions here so you should all know
that that's the case but the basic idea
here is don't confuse
a president's ability to make something
a personal document which I don't think
they have the right
I don't think the president can just say
after the fact it's personal
but there is also nobody else who can do
it
isn't that weird it's just a black hole
if you don't do it on day one
there's nobody's job it is later to say
oh this is wrong this was actually
personal
so I think what we have here which makes
me think that Trump will not have the
prison time for this I think what we
have here is a situation sufficiently
complicated that a jury is going to have
a tough time with it
and if the jury it was a tough time with
it I don't know how they find guilty
because it would just be too hard to
hold it in their heads they're just too
many variables here
so I don't know what's going to happen
but uh to me it looks like it's a big
old confusing case as opposed to
something where Trump was doing
something illegal
it looks like just confusion over who
had rights and if that's all it is I
don't think people go to prison for that
so my overall feeling is that the legal
system will not put him in jail
but I could be surprised
all right Peggy Noonan's writing about
Trump making sure that we
we buy into the summer hoax now the
summer hoax is that somehow we magically
know that the documents in those boxes
are not just classified which is the one
part we do know
but dangerous dangerous to the to the
country
now nobody's claiming that any of that
information got out
in any way that was dangerous
so there's no victim
they still have to make it look like
it's terrible after the fact
when there's no victim
now if you're talking about it before
these documents had been secured you
said oh we've got all these maybe
sensitive documents that are unsecured I
would say act right away let's do
something to secure those documents who
did that who is to blame
but it's already over
the documents are secured
there's no risk now
and apparently there was there was no
exposure to them so there's no alleged
victim whatsoever
but they've got to make this the biggest
story in the summer because it's all
they got
so Peggy Noonan writes this uh
peace in the Wall Street Journal to try
to make that case
and in their own writing she referenced
something she said in the past about
Trump and entering the Weimar Republic
phase
that's right a Hitler reference
so here's a person who is writing an
article which you were supposed to gain
some wisdom and insight by reading her
opinion
and you know that before you even hear
the opinion about the documents that she
is at one time gone full Hitler in her
understanding of trump
now is there anything else you need to
listen to from this individual I think
that's completely disqualified
if you've ever referred
to Trump like in a serious way as oh why
my Republic
next Hitler or dictator authoritarian
it's just disqualifying because you know
at that point that they're not even
trying
they're not even trying to be useful or
helpful
so she goes on with a bunch of twaddle
about how dangerous these documents
might be that we've never seen
um
here here's a sentence for you can't get
more serious more breathtaking on a
charge against a former president
the documents have to do with the most
essential of our security interests
there about how we keep our country safe
from military attack
are they are they Peggy
which ones did you get to read
yeah which ones did you get to read
because I didn't get to read any of them
and I don't believe that they're
important or sensitive or that they
matter at all
do I believe that one of them might
reference a attack plan on another
country sure
Maybe
Maybe
do I think that that attack plan would
actually make a difference
to anybody if they saw it what do you
think an executive level attack plan
looks like
let's say it's Iran we don't know that
but let's say this let's say it was an
attack plan for Iran do you think Iran
would learn anything from that
the executive summary of the attack plan
well the first wave would be an air
attack and we'd use all our good weapons
and missiles because they didn't know
that
they didn't know that we first would do
an air attack with missiles and try to
do it for a distance and they they did
they didn't see that our Intel
in the country to you know arm them
never saw that coming
what could possibly be in an Iran attack
document that Iran would not consider
completely obvious
that the whole point of having a giganto
army
military
is that you can attack anybody of that
size and you pretty much know you're
going to win because you've got the big
military that can do all the things that
you put on that memo but everybody else
knows it too
everybody knows
how the attacks look
you know I suppose they say stuff like
oh we're going to do uh lighting attack
to try to take Tehran
what happens when the actual war starts
because the other thing that we know is
that warp lands only lasts until the
first shot and then you have to then you
have to alter so basically what we
imagine we're doing on day one is going
to be whatever they teach in the war
colleges it's going to be like all the
obvious attack stuff and then that would
be infinitely tweaked if any real war
happened
so what what is it that Iran would learn
from that probably nothing
probably nothing
just like I said it would be an
executive summary what would the
president be seeing is he going to see a
list of our assets
is it you see we'll put you know X
number of tanks into the theater or
whatever we wouldn't I don't think we'd
use things but
I just can't imagine what it would be
that it wouldn't make any difference
so
is it uh serious and breathtaking
does it talk about U.S nuclear programs
oh no
oh no all right here's one
when it talks about the U.S nuclear
program
did they say weapons
that have you ever once asked yourself
this question all the reporting I see is
about our quote nuclear program
how do you know that means weapons
couldn't it be that we plan to build a
bunch of nuclear reactors if we can
yeah why why doesn't it mean energy
I don't know I mean it could
are you telling me that you know there's
no chance that it could just be about
nuclear energy
it might be
yeah no I think it's more likely that
it's about nuclear weapons of course but
we don't know anything about potential
vulnerabilities of the US
really do you think somebody gave the
president a document about a potential
vulnerabilities and he took it with him
foreign
I don't believe that
not not intentionally like a document
that if our enemy saw it
they they could destroy our country
you any think he just threw that in the
box with the other stuff
I don't think so
I mean I get that it's potentially true
it doesn't seem likely
uh and plans for possible retail
retaliation again which would be totally
generic in my my opinion
all right
so we've seen this movie before so
here's how the movie plays we're going
to spend all summer long because it's a
slow new summer it's always slow news
and All Summer Long the news will try to
make us guess what's in those boxes and
they'll use so many words like serious
and breathtaking that you'll start to
think there's something bad in those
boxes which by the way it might be
but we've seen the movie too many times
and the movie goes like this oh those
boxes have so many secrets in them
secrets of the worst possible kind all
right maybe they're not a lot of Secrets
but there's at least two or three really
bad okay not two or three Secrets but
one of those things in there was really
okay it wasn't what you thought it was
and that happens approximately two years
after the event
right
it's a two-year lag
two years from hoax to unveiling hoax
it's the same pattern every time so all
that matters is they can spend the
entire summer talking about the things
you can't see and you know if you could
see the things you can't see boy would
you feel bad whoa whoa would you hate
Trump if you could see the things that
nobody can see
right now if you can see the things that
you can see Trump looks pretty good
you know compared to Biden
but if you could see the things you
can't see
can we agree that if you could see the
things we can't see you'd be seeing some
stuff
oh what you would be seeing if you
couldn't see the things you could see
but the things you can see
look fine
but oh those things you can't see
all right Ukraine is turning into a joke
uh you know that all the news is
 I think one of the generals
said that all those pictures have
destroyed Ukrainian tanks are are this
he thinks it might be the same group of
five tanks that they photograph from
different angles
now I don't think that's quite true but
obviously there some of that is going on
right so some exaggeration of losses on
both sides but
have you seen the map
of how much land has changed hands since
the off the offensive started the
counter-offensive
and none
basically none
so the entire counter-offensive which is
definitely oh yeah it's losing a lot of
men but they're making sure but slow
progress and then today I today I
learned it might take several months of
probing the defenses before they find
the place they break through
sure that's convenient it's going to
take you several months
probe in those probe in those defenses
until you find the place you can break
through
oh Nancy Dill
let me let me take care Nancy you fell
for the 4chan hoax
you poor poor stupid you fell for
the 4chan hoax about me and my pandemic
opinions
you poor girl
poor girl
can we all say poor Nancy Dill
she believes anything
you're so gullible
you're adorable
so Nancy's my new mascot we're going to
call her clan clot Dill
Mrs clot
and continue on
all right um
that probably got me demonetized
totally worth it
um you know my opinion
about the Ukraine war that is really
just a big negotiation at this point
because there's not much land that's
going to change hands and they just need
to beat each other up until somebody's
willing to talk peace
so I I looked on CNN today looking for
news
and I read all over the top and
everything and there wasn't any news
I mean there were headlights
but none of it looked like
news of any importance to anybody
because it's summer right it's not
really their fault it's just summer
and there's not much news but there was
one there was one
headline
that looked like it was news and the
headline it was something about along
the lines of
um Putin was looking for any way out of
the Ukraine situation
now that would be interesting story
wouldn't it because that would sort of
suggest he's ready to negotiate which
would be the biggest story there is
so I clicked on that link that said that
Putin you know might be open to anything
to end the war
and after I clicked on the link it went
to a different story
the only thing on the CNN page that I
thought was interesting that was worth
clicking on it was a bad link
true story
it was the only thing that looked
interesting and it was a bad link it
went to the wrong story
so that's all you need to know about
about CNN's news Gathering ability well
we almost had a story but we couldn't
get the link
um
all right I had a little incident in
Starbucks yesterday some of you watched
my live stream yesterday you know that I
I'd been up the night before with
uh food poisoning and hadn't slept all
night
and uh sometimes my temper
is not as easily controllable if I
haven't slept
it's a thing
so I was in food I was in Starbucks and
uh I thought I might have just enough
energy
to do you know a good solid hour of work
today you know creative work
and
I have like five deadlines at the moment
because I'm trying to put together two
books you know a new one and a reissue
looking trying to get audio books done
I've got you know the local stuff I've
got this I got twice a day so I have
something like five deadlines a day
roughly speaking
and
I go go into Starbucks
tired and cranky I sit down and there's
only three people in the Starbucks
um
customers
all three of us have laptops clearly we
all came there to work
guy behind me pulls down his cell phone
and starts making a call
no problem people make phone calls from
Starbucks all the time and it's usually
something like you know oh I'll be home
in 15 minutes or did you get my email
right this guy decides to make a very
long and what was obviously going to be
a lengthy loud phone call right behind
me
in a place with only three people and
it's me on my laptop obviously trying to
work and he's doing the phone call
so the first thing I say to myself is
well
there's no law that says he can't do
that right there's no sign there's no
there's no guideline
so
it's just my problem
right it's just something bothering me
this is not about it's not about him
I'm telling myself
and I try to work and I couldn't I I
couldn't even see the laptop
because my vision started turning red
because I was getting more and more
angry
and I was saying this on the I didn't
live stream from the man cave last night
so I said something of this I you know I
first did the the three look around
technique
which I'm going to model for you some of
you have seen it the so he was behind me
by facing my Direction so the first look
around you you just keep a neutral
expression you know like maybe you were
just looking for something else
and then the point of that is that he
would think oh is this guy looking at me
because I'm on my phone
but there would be some ambiguity there
because maybe I was just looking at
something else
but maybe on his own he would think oh
shoot he might have been looking at me
because I'm on my phone I'll better make
this short
but that didn't make any difference he
was clearly engaged in a long phone call
so then I had to do the second look
around and you know the second look
around you add a little attitude
so that one looks like this
got that one yeah it's the stink eye
this is the stink eye but the stink eye
didn't make any difference either
I went for the full turnaround
so next I had to go
full turnaround no difference
just continued with this phone call
so now I said to myself well
I'm not going to make a thing about this
I'm just going to pack up my laptop and
call it a day and I'm just going to
write the day off and literally I'm
gonna go back to bed
because
this is not a fight I need
it's not like I'm some kind of Karen you
know it's not like I'm going to cause a
scene in a public place
so as I was packing up my laptop I was
feeling my
willpower and self-control if you
imagine it starting at 100 it already
was down to about 75 percent
but that's plenty and that's a lot of
willpower 75 no problem but as I was
getting ready to gather up my garbage to
throw it away I feel it crossed the 50
threshold and I still wasn't gone
and I thought
oh
and then it kept dropping he had about
25 10 and I thought oh
I'm about five seconds away from Hulk
smash
and I don't have anywhere to stop it
so a conversation ensued
he didn't enjoy it
I won full Karen
I I think I don't remember everything I
said because sometimes you get angry you
don't remember what you said
but I do remember this part
and it went like this
of this entire neighborhood there is
only one place you shouldn't be making
that phone call right there right where
you are this is the only place you
should not be doing that
but he told me that was my opinion
now I have I tweeted about it because I
wanted to see other people's opinions I
was wondering if other people would say
hey Live and Let Live there's no rule
against making a phone call
but here's my take on this and of course
I've owned a couple of restaurants I'm
I'm triggered by cell phones in
restaurants there is no situation where
using your phone where other people are
in a social situation is okay
it's not okay in the movie theater it's
not okay in the restaurant
I understand the two people do make
phone calls more often as Starbucks I
get that but like I said
short ones
short ones no problem at all right but
if you get on there and you stay on
there I think you don't understand how
much annoying that is somebody tried to
tell me that the problem was my on my
end because it really was just an
opinion of who was right and wrong who
was wrong to which I say really would
would fingernails on a chalkboard
be my opinion that it bothers me
is that an opinion if I were to piss on
your salad is it your opinion
that it doesn't taste good
is that an opinion
no some things are not a opinion
some things are just cause of the fact
and we know from science that listening
to one side of a phone call will make
you insane
if you if it's blocking you from doing
what you want to do especially so
there's no doubt about the cause and
effect and if you pretend you don't know
that you're an
I'm sorry if you pretend you're not
aware of how much of a fingers on the
chalkboard it is to have a phone call in
front of somebody
you are a and if if this
is the first time you're hearing about
it
you know fine
now I'm gonna
all right I'm gonna say one story uh
remind me on locals I'm going to save
you one phone call story just for locals
there's one I can't tell in public
all right but let's just say
this phone call in public situation
I've been dealing with this a little bit
so I've got some experience here
anyway
that ladies and gentlemen is all I
wanted to say
is there anything you'd like to hear
about was he Brown no he was he was a
white frat boy looking guy
slick back hair maybe a real estate guy
I don't know
not sure
I hope I'm still welcome back in
Starbucks
all right anything else I forgot
did I miss any topics
I'll give you the rest of the story on
locals
uh did you take on the chef Center might
change your mind
I don't think so there's no way I'd be
um in favor of a large fine I just don't
I don't want the members of Congress
voting fines for each other
I'm just not cool with that so there's
nothing you could tell me that would
change my mind in that
I don't think so anyway
all right we talked about Tucker
mgg was snubbed by Trump on the runway I
don't know anything about that
you know I don't mind people who talk
too loud at a restaurant
that doesn't bother me too much
I understand why it bothers other people
but personally it doesn't bother me too
much
um all right did he know it was me
oh that's a good question
uh I'm gonna think I'm gonna say not
because when people know my job they
treat me differently
so he definitely treated me like a
Starbucks Patron
all right that's all I got now and I
will talk to you YouTube
tomorrow thanks for joining the best
live stream ever
