hey
everybody come on in
here you know what time it is yeah it's
time for coffee with Scott Adams today's
coffee will be a special
blend no longer will we rely on simple
coffee beans for our coffee pleasure
today the coffee beans
are mixed with the
subtle and yet sophisticated Taste of
something I like to call
exoneration yes coffee is great by
itself exoneration pretty great stuff
too all by itself but when you combine
them you combine the ex exoneration and
the coffee you get the best simultaneous
sip that you've had since November 9th
2016
and if you would please join me grab
your copy your mug your chalice your
Stein you're tankered your thermos fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
simultaneous
sip it's so good so bold and
beautiful
well of course the big news is the
Mueller response but I thought you
you're seeing a lot of that in the other
news so I'd like to interview
Dale the
anti-trumper Dale could you come over
here I'd like to hear about your uh I
understand you went on a big uh elephant
hunt a safari you were trying toh see if
you could shoot a a big elephant is that
right that's right it was very
successful too my elephant fun my
elephant hunt was very successful really
so you got it what kind of an elephant
did you
shoot I did not shoot any
elephants well you just said your
elephant hunt was totally successful
what does that
mean well you got to look at the
details we all piled into our utility
vehicle in the hotel parking lot and
when we were pulling out of our parking
space we ran over a
squirrel you ran over a
squirrel I thought you said you had a
successful elephant hunt but you didn't
shoot any
elephants I just told you we ran over a
squirrel in the parking lot
Victory
success no
Dale there's a big big difference
between going on an elephant hunt and
getting an
elephant versus running over a squirrel
in the parking
lot I don't think you can claim victory
for simply killing a
squirrel I didn't say I killed
it are you saying the
squirrel
survived I think it had a
limp and
seen
so the hard work begins today with this
Russia collusion stuff because the tough
part is trying to sort out the at least
three different categories of people who
were on the losing side of the
Saga Number One are actual literal
traitors people who seem to
apparently have been intent on
overthrowing the entire the entire
country an actual
coup those
people probably need to go to jail for
the rest of their lives at a minimum if
if we can confirm if the legal system
does its thing right I don't want to you
know not in favor of any no crowd
Justice or anything like that but it
does seem at this point that the
likelihood that they were genuine
traitors who were trying to overthrow
the country it feels very close to
probable I would say well no it's not
close to probable it's
probable but there's another group who
are simply fooled by their own side the
people who experience cognitive
dissonance and I would say that those
people need to be
understood so you don't need to tr to
you know you don't need to punish the
people who were simply Bamboozled by
their own side they're also victims and
I would say that a lot of the the TV
news personalities fall into that camp
but there's another Camp the um let's
call them the The Advocates the
partisans so there's a group that
actually didn't care if it was true or
not and they're in some ways they're the
the most weasel like group let me give
you some
examples from some partisans who are
probably not the traitors and in fact
you know I have no reason to suspect
that they're the actual traitors behind
this whole thing but they're also not
the people who were just fooled by it
they're people who apparently were not I
can't read their minds but based on
their actions it seems that they're just
partisans and they're going to stick
with the story no matter what here are a
few of them
this from David from
F famous anti-trumper here's his tweet
from this morning there's four five
bullet points and this and this is his
response to the Mueller
conclusions a truck of TVs is hijacked
now the first thing you're going to say
to yourself is what do a truck of TVs
have to do with Mueller
investigation so the first thing you
need to know is if somebody has
retreated to an
analogy they've already
lost right because they're not using the
analogy to make a point they're trying
to win the argument with an analogy and
you can't do that you've already lost if
you're trying he goes so number one a
truck of TVs is hijacked number two your
son meets with the hijackers three your
campaign manager shares root information
with them four you are recorded on video
saying I love truck hijacking five the
TVs are are in your house happy no
collusion day
so he had to change the situation that
actually happened the one with no
collusion into an entirely unrelated and
imaginary crime in order to convict him
of the imaginary
crime that's a partisan so this is not
somebody who's fooled by the the story
and it's unlikely that this is you know
that he was some original traitor
plotter kind of guy
he's he's just you know an illegitimate
voice here's another one from Peter da
friend of Hillary Clinton D
oou and he goes thread the ultimate
Gaslight so he's he's sticking with The
Gaslight theme he says the Muller Saga
is the ultimate gaslighting of the
American people totally credible
statement we saw Trump ask Russia to
hack Clinton's email they did we saw him
repeatedly bow down to
Putin we saw him obstruct Justice and
boast about it to Russian operatives I
don't remember anything about
that but
um what I said to that was evidently
Trump supporters know how to recognize
jokes personal persuasion used on
dictators and confirmation
bias so Peter da gives three pieces of
what he thinks are evidence the first
one was a joke when the president said
hey Russia if you have those emails they
like to see him he said that during the
debate second one is personals
persuasion he uses on dictators yes he's
nice to Kim Jong-un did it work yeah it
worked apparently it worked the
president is nice to president shei in
China did that work did it work to be
nice to president shei yeah it totally
worked because he can go tough on the
negotiating and still be respectful it
worked did the president try exactly the
same technique that we've seen worked
two times in a row did he try that same
technique with Putin which is to be nice
to Putin uh personally but to put
sanctions on go hard and do everything
he needs to do in the political realm
yes same method we saw it work
twice right in front of us is there
reason to believe it's a bad strategy
with Putin it's not a bad strategy it's
actually the smart strategy in fact if
you were to rank all the different ways
you could approach Russia the very best
one is to be respectful to their leader
and also go as hard as you possibly can
against anything that needs to go hard
you know the the military the
you know everything
else um so when you're seeing the
partisans they're they're not to be
taken
seriously um I am loving as I'm sure
many of you watching the compilation
clips of all the pundits who have been
saying for two years that the end is
near the end is near the end is near
it's the beginning of the end the
beginning of the end there's a bombshell
bombshell bombshell
bombshell all to find out is for
not now I
watched uh I've been watching the
news pretty much non-stop for the last
day I don't know that I've ever been
more
entertained because watching the actual
reactions of the people who bought into
it the people who were actually I'm
going to say
brainwashed in my opinion most of the
the famous um News hosts who are the
classic you know the anti-trump category
of News hosts as far as I can tell they
believed the story and the way you can
tell is because how disappointed they
are and how surprised they are and how
deeply damaged they are for one reason
or another so you can see it in their
faces and in the reactions and those are
not the faces and reactions of people
who knew all along it was a
hoax are they when as you watch the
reactions of the PE the anti-trumpers
the TV to TV types in
particular wouldn't you say that for the
most part they seem genuinely
surprised that that's my impression now
I'm not mind reading so I I can't know
for sure but my impression is they do
seem genuinely
surprised so so I would say that they
were actually
taken and one wonders if they're going
to um have a
response to be so to being so totally
screwed by the people they believed were
on their side now I don't believe that
the professional news people are being
fooled by the the David froms I don't
think they're being fooled by Peter da
because the the professional news people
know what a partisan looks like a
partisan is a partisan you don't take
them too seriously in fact you should
discount 100% of what they say and I
think the news people largely know to do
that and largely do
that but apparently there were there was
a whole other class of pundits who they
thought were closer to the reality based
um approach who completely Bamboozled
them they they hypnotized them and
here's the question that I ask in the
next
week here's what to look
for here's what to look for to find out
if the news is even a little bit
legitimate now I am willing to
accept honest
mistakes in my opinion there are a whole
bunch of people in the news industry who
honestly believed a version of reality I
would say that was a mistake but not one
that should be career ending in my
opinion those should not be
career-ending
mistakes to actually believe something
um but here's how you can tell if they
are legitimate players in the next week
if you see the news business bringing on
TV
psychologists maybe
hypnotists to explain why they and
others were so completely fooled by this
they would be legitimate
players so the legitimate news people
are going to bring on medical
professionals they're not going to bring
on more pundits to explain what we've
already seen if all they do is bring on
more pundits to say why they were really
right despite being obviously wrong then
you can't give them any
credit if you see somebody who is just
absolutely wrong
and they say I was completely wrong and
I got to say I really thought there was
something to this Russia thing I was
just completely wrong but what I think
we ought to do is understand why I was
so wrong and why other people were so
wrong so I'd like to introduce my next
guest I don't have a guest but I'm
talking about what they should say and
the next guest should be an expert
on cognitive dissonance an expert on
confirmation
bias that's the expert that needs to be
on all of these shows this week if you
don't see that you're not seeing anybody
who's even really trying because it's
obvious what's up now it's obvious that
this was always a psychological
phenomenon if we don't see it reported
as a psychological
phenomenon there's no reporting there
just won't
be an expert talking about the news
because the news is no longer just the
Mueller
report that's you know the factual basis
right and it's news by itself but
there's a news on top of that that's the
real news the news on top of the Muller
report is why did anybody believe it in
the first place why were people taken in
by confirmation bias when others were
not is it simply that people just just
um reverted to their teams and it wasn't
that one team was smarter or could see
through it but rather they were just
rooting for their team and that may be
the whole explanation but I want to see
the
psychologists explain what we just
experienced I've seen the
pundits all right in the same
week that this hoax died um and it in a
way it kind of stepped on the other news
that I think was at least least as big
the other news was that we know now that
the the Charlottesville fine people
quote was always fake news it was always
fake news and you can determine that
with certainty by looking at the
transcript and you can see that the
president when he said find people
without any prompting specifically
excluded the racist in Charlottesville
from being in the fine people category
but yet the news for years has reported
that he called the racist fine people
when he said in clear words literally
the
opposite now Wikipedia has now corrected
it with uh uh my help and a lot of other
people's help and Joel Pollock has been
reporting on this for a week or so
and so at least Wikipedia has corrected
the hoax the the mainstream news has not
and I'm not sure I would ever expect
them to do it but we no longer have to
doubt that it was a hoax because the you
know the the data is clear it's public
you can see it I've asked yeah I asked
sopes to take a look at it but I don't
know if they ever saw my message I never
got a return a return
comment um somebody says did I fall for
the hoax um I did not ever fall for the
charlott phille fine people hoax because
to me it was always obvious in context
what he meant and I did not fall for the
Russian collusion hoax so I personally
did not fall for either of those I did
fall for the
Covington kids hoax when I saw the first
video as soon as I saw the accurate
video I clarified and apologized
immediately once you see the actual
context it's obvious that the original
one was a fake so I'm not Beyond being
fooled by the news far from
but these two particular hoaxes I did
see
early
um here's an interesting thing that I
did not see coming in this whole
Saga the United States is the most
powerful
country maybe of you know in the
universe depends if sort it depends if
there are other civilizations in the
universe but let's say our solar system
the United States is the most powerful
country powerful military powerful
economy most powerful country in the
world there's only one thing that this
country needs to weaponize all that
power and you know what that is it's a
common
enemy if the United States is fighting
with itself which we like to do if we
don't have someone else to fight with
we'll fight with each other we're sort
of a fighting country we're we're we're
we're kind of a scrappy bunch of people
right we like to fight a little bit
maybe that's just every
country but every now and then we get a
common
enemy do you remember when Isis was our
common
enemy Isis doesn't have territory
anymore we just went in there and just
wiped out their whole territorial
holding and a whole lot of people
because when we have a common
enemy there's not much that can stop the
United States and it's not going to be
another country we have a common enemy
we now have a common enemy in and I'm
not talking about the fake news the fake
news is a problem the fake news is a
problem the common enemy in
this case is whoever fed the fake news
whoever used the fake news as a
tool that's our common enemy there is
somebody in the story and we don't know
who yet well we do know let let's face
it we sort of do know I'm not going to
name names because it's a little early
but we kind of know we kind of know
who's behind it all at least we know
some of the names we might learn some
more but there are some genuinely evil
people there are some seriously evil
people in this story yeah I'll I'll let
you speculate on the names some of them
are more obvious than others but um
yeah I would say of the of the likely
guilty crew there are at
least there are at least
two that you can at least have a
conversation about the death
penalty I would say so I think the death
penalty is there a death penalty for
treason I have to Google that hold on a
second is there death p y for treason
United
States is there a death penalty for
treason
uh search for
death uh penalty is
death definition section three of the
United States Constitution treason is
specifically limited to levying war
against the US or adhering to their
enemies uh giving them Aid and
comfort so
treason seems to be a war context so let
me ask you
this um does that apply to a country
that has nuclear weapons aimed at us
we're not technically at a state of war
with Russia are we but they do have
nuclear weapons aimed at
us well if somebody's aiming a weapon at
you are they your
friend I mean I don't think do you think
Canada has any weapons aimed at the
United States I don't think so so it
says that under those can the penalty
could be death or not less than five
years of
imprisonment
um wow and then I guess there are
different
stat you know so the states have their
own laws apparently there's a federal
law and then there's state laws
so my guess is that somebody like um um
Ellen DT would say treason does not
apply because we're not in a state of
War technically and that might be case
so it might be true that there's no
treason possibility unless you're in the
context of war and then that would be
arguable so I think probably that would
not be on the table so my best guess is
that the death penalty is off the table
how about sedition somebody says let's
look up sedition let's all learn about
sedition is the overt conduct such as
speech and organization that tends
towards Insurrection against the
established order so basically working
to overcome the established
order uh is there a
penalty is there a penalty well okay we
have different countries have different
laws on sedition in the United
States we have the alien or we did do we
still have the Alien and Sedition
Acts
um for the punishment of certain crimes
false or scandalous and malicious
writing that can't be against the
law um it looks like this section is too
long for me to read
live all right well it's a punishable
offense
um but I would have to be more of a
lawyer to sort out whether that applies
in this
case all
right um so if I had to guess I would
say that the the government and the
justice system will start moving against
the
original um
plotters and that might take years I
mean Trump might be you know done with
his second term when we learn anything
about this but um I'm pretty sure
Lindsay Graham is not going to let go of
this um now let's talk about some
politics so I was you saw me praising
the the president's uh Showmanship um
Instinct by not tweeting for what almost
two days he didn't tweet about this
whole uh you know the wrapping up of the
m
report and then when he did tweet it was
just sort of basic I think his tweet was
well let's check the president's tweets
this morning he may be tweeting while
I'm talking so let's look up
Trump and see what he has tweeted this
morning
uh so he he covered it just straight he
said 18 hours ago he goes no collusion
no obstruction complete and total
exoneration keep America
great now there is absolutely no
hyperbole in that there is no
exaggeration there is no um no false
statement there is no
provocation but here's what's
cool there is no
Revenge there is no
politics he just gives us the facts so
he goes 48 hours or so whatever it was a
day plus without tweeting anything and
then he just gives it to us straight is
that the president Trump you
expected see that's the beauty of
it one of the uh you know the major
elements of publicity of brand of
managing people's attention is knowing
when to violate their expectations
because that's what makes you pay
attention you know if you're a little
bit inappropriate that's why people
watch and he has chosen obviously to
stay completely vanilla he's he's
intentionally being boring because the
new cycle itself is so good for him the
last thing he wants to do is say
something and draw attention away from
it so he couldn't go too long without
saying something so he just puts it in
the record no collusion no no
obstruction complete and total
exoneration just the facts brilliant
what would be the one thing that would
scare the country the most now that we
know that the Muller report results the
high level results what would be the
worst thing the president could have
done the worst thing the president could
have done is to say now we're going to
try to Jail the people who started this
total mistake total mistake don't go
there you do not want to go for revenge
or even hinting at it you do not want to
go low because you're you're sitting on
the high ground right now you don't want
to change that anything you could do
could be a mistake that could hurt you
but there's nothing you could do to make
this better there's nothing the
president could say to make this better
than it already is it's as good as it
can freaking get so the way he's playing
it is just brilliant now when he gave
his live comments I guess he was heading
to the helicopter or something again he
he put his personality on it but he
didn't go hard he did not go he did not
go crazy he did not go Revenge he did
not go emotional he he sort of just
played it straight gave the people a
little news bite keep this keep the
existing story going without changing it
didn't want to change it because he's
smart all right
um so Nadler Nadler is still going to be
going after the president but what do
you feel you being the public what do
you the public feel about Nadler and his
what will be continuing pestering
lawsuits how do you feel about that now
that you know the whole Russia collusion
thing was a
fraud does it feel the same because if
you thought the Russia thing was real
then anything that nler was going to do
felt also legitimate didn't it because
because they felt like they were sort of
part of the same universe of complaints
so as long as you were still allowed to
imagine that the Muller thing was going
to come up with some real dirt it was
also reasonable to think well nler will
come up with some more real dirt so if
Mueller was
legitimate maybe Nadler is too they're
both sort of just investigating the
president for similar things why
wouldn't they both be
legitimate but now that we know that the
Mueller report and and I will say that
Mueller and his team are were
legitimate um as far as we can tell what
does that do to to nads or old nads as I
like to call
them it doesn't make him look good does
it and so I'm going to start referring
to nler and anybody who's sort of on his
team because it will be a small team of
people swirling around Nadler and and
being his
supporters so I've decided to give them
a a band name you know when you name a
band kind of gives them an identity so
you have to give your band a name I'm
going to name uh nadler's
band Nadler and the
dingleberries so his new musical name
will be Nadler and the dingleberries the
dingleberries will be the the little
lawsuits and the people swirling around
them yeah so it's nads and the
dingleberries and they shall
become the the free
um they shall become the free
advertisement for Trump's 2020
campaign because Nadler went from
something that maybe could help the
Democrats to something that's going to
be a gigantic uh image problem for the
Democrats here's why it's an image
problem now that Mueller has shown that
there was nothing there Nadler is
exposed as just a partisan before you
could say well maybe he was trying to do
the work of the the country you know
maybe you know of course he's partisan
but maybe it's also good work you don't
know but now now you're free to say it's
it's now this is just
partisan whatever he's going to come up
with is just going to be BS it's going
to be pestering the president it's going
to be presidential harassment and so he
must be
mocked for his
work we the people should be part of the
solution and we can be by simply putting
him in his proper place in history nads
and the
dingleberries are now the greatest
threat to the president
presidency and they're also
ridiculous and they're also not much of
a threat so let's treat them the way
they
are nads and the dingleberries I think
it's
catchy
um uh do do any of you remember when I
went on the Sam Harris podcast I don't
remember when it was was
it was it
it I'm not sure a couple years ago
and um Sam Aris is a notable
anti-trumper and we talked about things
including Russia collusion and
including I don't I don't remember if
Charlesville came up it might
have but how does that conversation look
now through the filter of current
events because if if you look at it now
I'm pretty sure that Sam was on the side
of there's something here with this
Russia stuff I don't remember all the
details but I would love to catch up
with him and see if if his thinking has
changed about what we've been watching
for the last couple years and the reason
that Sam is interesting and I know you
know everybody has their uh their fans
and their haters he's got his hair as do
I but I would say sam Harris is is
different from other people in the
conversation because he's he's
legitimately fact-based
meaning that that's his brand right his
brand is facts and
reason uh and I would love to
see how if how if at all he has
reassessed his
filters based on the current events it's
possibly hasn't but I would say he more
than anybody else in that
Universe has you know a solid you know a
solid uh let's say I would give him high
expectations that he's revised how he's
looking at the entire situation if the
only thing you revise is how you looked
at the specific case then you haven't
learned the lesson the lesson is not hey
we were wrong about that one thing
that's not the the lesson the lesson is
not we were wrong about this one thing
this Russia thing the lesson is how
easily we can be
fooled once you understand the bigger
lesson you can start asking yourself
seriously wait a minute could I also be
fooled about this other thing let me
give you an example climate change what
is the most common opinion about climate
change from the people who think it's a
problem the most common opinion is it's
settled uh the scientists are soundly on
one side there's plenty of science
plenty of measurements it's
done now you've seen this Russia thing
now the Russia thing obviously has no
connecting tissue to climate change just
completely different topics but once you
learn that you can be that certain about
something on the Russia collusion stuff
and be wrong completely wrong you have
to take that thinking if you're a if
you're a functional thinker you have to
take what you learn from that and move
it over to other cases and at least ask
yourself should I be on guard that this
has happened more than
once and here's what I would ask you to
consider and I I just discovered this
this
week the very least I believed you know
the the smallest claim that I believed
was absolutely true is that the climate
scientist have a good understanding of
the last 100 years now you could argue
that they may have less of an
understanding about you know you ancient
history but for the last 100 years we
could measure things better you know we
have a much better grip on the variables
so I thought that the
that the climate scientists could
explain at least the last 100 years but
it turns out that there's a gigantic
part of it like the first half in which
they just say well we think it was
aerosols and maybe there was something
about industrial pollution because the
first half of the half of the
Century doesn't really not half but the
first half of that 100 years or so
doesn't match the CO2 prediction meaning
that the CO2 is the the only lever you
need to look at because the argument is
that earlier CO2 was not the only lever
and that aerosols in pollution and maybe
um well the aerosol are from the
pollution and maybe volcanoes were
skewing what the models would have told
you if CO2 had been the only variable
now I believe what I'm just say I'm
saying is true and of course in the
climate change era you have to assume
that you know you're you're always on
Shaky Ground no matter what you're
claiming it seems
um but if that's
true then it's certainly not
true that the scientists are darn sure
that they know what's going on because
if they don't know why the model didn't
work meaning that they're not all on the
same page so some people think they know
but science is not a read there's not a
definite idea of why the the temperature
is even done when it's done even in the
last 100 years so I would
say that that the The Limited claim of
climate science that we know what's
going on with great certainty for the
last 100 years is disproved by their own
their own statements because they will
tell you clearly that we think it was
the pollution in the volcanoes earlier
you know uh I don't know 50 years ago or
whatever we think it was the volcanoes
and we're pretty sure it's likely it was
the
pollution does that sound like they know
what's going on that's the opposite if
they said it's definitely these things
that I'd say okay well you got to you
got a handle on this if they say it's
likely these
things that's not everybody being on the
same page likely doesn't get it
done all right because I don't think
anybody's told
you that their models are just likely
they pretty much tell you that we're in
deep deep trouble and it's guaranteed so
while
I I'll get rid of this guy uh troll
goodbye
troll so um my claim just to be very
clear I'm not making a claim one way or
another on climate change I don't know
if it's a gigantic problem and should be
our big biggest issue I don't know if
it's not a giant problem I just know
that the one individual claim is
debunked which is that the scientists
are on the same side and they understand
what's been happening for the last 100
years or so because they don't not for
sure so it's only the it's only the
certainty part that's that's in question
all right
um
um do I have any thoughts on Apple
streaming service well that's that's a
whole new topic um I'm sure it will be
pretty good because Apple doesn't make
bad products um do you think Trump
should reexamine I don't know what you
mean did the Russian model get
debunked what
model
um yes Matt Tai's uh blog post about how
badly we got taken on on this Russ
clusion stuff is is a mustre it's just
brilliant writing and it's also
factually
Illuminating
um NRA I I see a lot of questions coming
in they're all over the board
here climate change model why does
somebody keep saying climate change
model to
me um so yeah the the climate models uh
oh I think you're prompting me to give
you an update on this I made a climate
change Challenge and it was this there
are 31 or so major models usually
there's one model that uh per country so
each country has their preferred climate
change prediction model but there's one
of them that's different from the rest
it's way different and it's the Russian
model the Russian model that's way
different from the rest is the only one
that's been accurate lately so all of
the models hindcast meaning that they
all accurately um they all accurately
describe the past but that's the easy
part it's easy to make your model
describe the past the hard part is
getting it to predict only one of the 31
or so models has done both it's the
Russian model now the awkward part is
that the Russian model is nowhere near
all the other 31 so the other 31 are
like we're all doomed it's the end of
the world it's somewhere in this range
and the Russian model is way down here
and the Russian model says it might get
a little warmer but no big
deal so I simply asked the question do
do I have the facts right is it a fact
that there are 31 is models is it a fact
that the Russian one is different from
the rest is it a fact that the Russian
one says there will be warming but not
that much that you have to think it's
the end of the world and is it true that
the Russian model is the only one that
has been right in in recent several
years that's all I want to know if
that's true then the climate
change certainty the climate change
settled science is not
true and I asked that question of the
most effective um Skeptics that I that I
interact with on Twitter and there are a
lot of them I interact with a lot of
climate not I'm sorry not Skeptics I I
interact with them too but I interact
with a lot of um climate
science let's say hobbyist experts as
well as some who are actually scientists
and the ones who are really good at
debunking the Skeptics are really good
at it so there are two of them in
particular who are always in my feed and
they are just shooting down the Skeptics
like crazy and the Skeptics are coming
in but what about this and then they say
well this study debunks it so they're
the great debunkers debunkers of the
Skeptics not debunkers of the
science and yeah Steve Gard um he's part
of who they they debunk so um and I
don't mean they debunk everything Steve
Gard says uh Tony heler they don't I
don't know that they debunk every claim
he makes but a lot of them they have
debunked now when I say debunked I mean
that they have an argument that looks
strong who knows who's right it's hard
for me to judge these things but they
have strong
arguments to counter the Skeptics and I
simply asked is there a strong argument
to counter this one claim this this one
small claim that the Russian model is
the only one that seems to work and that
it doesn't predict
doom
and things got really
quiet now it's possible that one of
those debunkers actually did
produce an argument to debunk that point
and and I haven't seen it so if somebody
has seen it let me know um because
Twitter is sort of a place to make sure
you've seen everything and and those
those conversations are so detailed and
long you just wouldn't know if something
scrolled by so if anybody has seen an
argument against that point that the
Russian model is the accurate one I'd
like to see it so I don't have a
conclusion but I will tell you that I've
been asking a lot of skeptical questions
about climate change for months and
months and months
and um that's the only one that didn't
have a quick
response so it makes me wonder if there
is a response somebody said how to
contact me uh Twitter is best just send
send a tweet and include me in it and if
you've got an argument I'd like to see
it because and it's better if you do it
in public I'd like other people to see
your argument too because they might
have a Counterpoint to it all right um I
think somebody said so the climate is
not changing I believe all the models
including the Russian model say that the
climate is changing and the CO2 is is a
key variable I believe all of them
including the Russian models say that
but they have different
sensitivities uh I believe also that the
Russian model is the only one that uses
an accurate input for one of the key
variables now that's another claim
that's made but you don't need to know
about that claim so much as just whether
or not it's the one that's
been uh all right uh pardon somebody
asked somebody says what about pardons
well um some are saying this would be
the perfect time to issue
pardons because um the president is in
such a winning place he's got the he's
got the Goodwill at the moment and he
could just you know slide him through
the new cycle
because the news cycle would ignore them
relative to the bigger
story I believe that's not the
case I believe he might want to wait a
little bit now I don't know what a
little bit looks like a little bit could
be two weeks a little bit could be a
year so I don't know what wait a little
bit looks like but it's somewhere
between two weeks in a year because the
news cycle right now is so unambiguously
positive that you don't want to do
anything to disrupt that you you need
you need the news to just flounder for a
while in a way that's just so good for
for you once it's done and the news has
moved on to other to other um fake news
because you know it will so once other
fake news is in the news and the
president is being
attacked that's a point where he might
have an opportunity to change the new
cycle because the moment he gives a
pardon
that becomes the news so he has a
positive news cycle with the Muller
report giving him full exoneration the
worst thing he could do is pardon people
who committed real crimes the same week
because then suddenly people say well
okay you were exonerated but I don't
want to talk about that anymore let's
just talk about this
sketchy um thing you did with your uh
pardon
so yes I believe he has a a clear Glide
path so he could he has a Glide path
definitely for
pardoning
um all the the minor players so he can
definitely pardon um Roger Stone I think
that one's easy so the Roger Stone
pardon I would say is something close to
guaranteed if if Stone doesn't take care
of it on its own it's possible that the
stone thing will just go away on its own
I don't know but I think that's an easy
part maniford is a tough one and I'm not
sure I'd even recommend it because
maniford was a flat out crook he and you
know he only got caught because of this
drag net but I mean he there's nothing
you can say about being a tax cheat that
happened too Jerome Cory would be an
easy
pardon Flynn as far as I know would be
an easy pardon so I think he has a total
Glide path for
Flynn
Cory and stone manifer is a little
little trickier all right
Papadopoulos I don't know if is a pardon
necessary for Papadopoulos he's already
out does that even help maybe it clears
his record or
something um all right that's enough for
now and I will talk to you later
