morning everybody
and welcome
to another highlight of the universe
it's called coffee with scott adams
there's never been anything better um
you could search the entire world and
well you're not going to find anything
better
but could it be even better than better
yes there is a level above better
it's called better better and all you
need to get there is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tank or jealous or stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes everything better
really everything
now you're thinking there's an exception
nope
everything
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
that came directly from heaven
pretty sure
well what's going on with you today
so i had a weird day yesterday how many
of you have had a day like this
i woke up this morning i realized that i
had zero human contact yesterday
i talked to people by phone and talked
to people by
messaging i did a live stream
i saw people
i had zero conversations in person with
a human being
yesterday the whole day
now i had some plans that fell through
which is why i mean it wasn't it wasn't
a normal situation
but
today i have no plans
so today i would expect i'll probably
have no human contact
and then this weekend
as far as i know
no human
contact in fact i only have one thing on
my calendar for the rest of my life
would you like to know what it is
literally there's only one thing on my
calendar for the rest of my life
it's uh the russell brand interview
so
if things go well i'll be talking to him
on wednesday august 31st
um and
you know what it's all you need
yeah it's all you need
you don't really need much human contact
you just need a video of me talking to
russell brand and you're going to get
that now i assume that's recorded so i
don't know when it actually runs
i'm noticing his production values keep
going up
yeah i assume it's i believe it is
recorded
i'll let you know if it's not
um i have fallen for possibly
two hoaxes this week alone
let's see if you fell for these and by
the way i don't know if these are hoaxes
so there are two things that
i thought were true-ish
that other people say are hoaxes let's
see if you can confirm that they're
hoaxes
number one
did you see a video it's on twitter
of a young woman who
purports to have used ai to have created
a
deep fake that looks really really real
and then
but but apparently it's a hoax
and the hoax is it's actually just a
real person
so it's a real person
doing a deep fake of a deep fake which
is pretty clever
totally fell for it
now
it's a weird hoax because it's so close
to something that can actually be done
that
i don't know i i like a hoax when it's
something that definitely can't be done
you know something impossible and
somebody believes it but if it's this
close to something that could actually
be done in the real world
it's it's interesting but it's not quite
a hoax it's more like fake news
all right so that was fun
the other one that i'm told is a hoax is
the news that the big bang has theory
has been debunked
so the the article uh
that made all the noise recently was
that the scientists are quote panicked
because the web telescope
is showing that the big bang
didn't happen
but if you turn if you talk to people
who are in that field they something
they say something more along the lines
of
nothing like that happened
no the big bang's still fine
there's just some things that the web
showed that are different than
prediction
and you know we haven't worked that out
but basically the big bang is confirmed
by many in other ways
it's just that there's some new
information that didn't fit the
didn't fit the
exact predictions oh yo slight
yeah it's just slightly different than
the prediction
so
doesn't this sort of
beg the question
what is a slight difference
because my understanding is that they
discovered
entire galaxies at the edge of the
universe that couldn't exist
because of the age
in other words it would be impossible
for the big bang to have happened the
way it's predicted to have happened
if the oldest things
or the oldest looking things are at the
edge of the universe
they should look the youngest
because by the time the light reaches us
we'd be seeing the past
so i may i may be describing that wrong
but the point is there are some galaxies
they shouldn't be where they are
i've got a feeling that's not a slight
problem
but if a scientist tells you it's a
slight problem what are you going to do
you're going to disagree with the
scientists
i believe i will i believe i'm going to
disagree with the scientists
i don't think there's a slight problem
if you've got galaxies that are the
wrong age in the wrong place
that feels like a big problem
right
and does it matter how many things
confirm the big bang if there's one big
thing that says it didn't happen
i'm pretty sure that no matter how many
other things confirm it did happen
if you have one really glaring big thing
that says it didn't
isn't it more likely that the other
things are you know a confirmation bias
or a false positive
the rogue astronomer that's right i'm
the rogue astronomer but of course i
think that uh simulation theory is
already debunked anyway so in my view
all of history is debunked
from evolution through oh by the way
they found a new
i guess there's a new skeleton
that adds a new human species to the
line
how many times are we going to find a
new
a new species that rewrites all of human
evolution
i feel like there was a lot of guessing
going on there
a lot of rewriting
all right
so
i guess i got hoaxed uh twice
potentially although i think the big
bang thing might be a a hoax that it's a
hoax so that's still uh still an open
question in my mind
all right i saw jared kushner uh giving
an interview he's got his book out
i think it's number one
jerry cushing's book is number one
bestseller
and
let me ask you this
many of you are skeptics
uh
and jeff says i've been hoaxed way more
than that
so so jeff i'm sure you'll have some
examples
do you remember
the thing that people say the most about
me
what's the biggest criticism you hear
about me there are two of them
two biggest criticisms you hear about me
number one i never admit i'm wrong
which i literally just did
i just told you i got hoaxed
practically every show i admit something
i got wrong
but yet it's the biggest the biggest
criticism against me is that
is that i don't admit when i get things
wrong even though i do it more i
probably do it more than anybody's ever
done it
i'll bet that's true
i know that's a absurd claim
but i'll bet for a public figure i've
admitted i'm wrong more than anybody
ever has
possibly because i do almost every show
i say well i used to think this but i
was wrong
right
now let me ask you this to see
who you think was right
jared kushner had an estimate of how
many lives were saved because of
vaccinations
what number did he put on that
now i'm not saying it's true
i'm saying that there was a
study that said that x number of lives
were saved by the vaccination programs
what do you think the number was
give me a number
20 million 20 million
do you believe it
do you believe that 20 million people
were saved by the vaccinations
well
if it didn't save 20 million people
or something along that those lines then
it probably wasn't worth it was it if i
feel like it would have to save at least
20 million or it wouldn't look like it
was worth it
because 20 million is a pretty small
percentage of
seven and a half billion or whatever we
are
so
so now do you believe do you disbelieve
the trump administration
when they say that and i'm sure trump
will say the same the 20 million people
are saved
do you think the trump administration is
lying to you
because many of you are trump supporters
you think that the person you support is
lying to you on such a big question
how can you possibly support trump if
you think the vaccinations were
is that a weird question
there's sort of a weird
um well i don't really understand it
because there's so many people who think
the pandemic was just sort of the
biggest thing that's happened and the
vaccinations were the biggest
evil that's happened
some would say
how in the world could you support trump
if you were anti-vaccination
that makes no sense at all
does it
all right
so i don't want you don't want to get
you all worked up about that just to let
you know that jared thinks that 20
million people were saved by it
and the estimate is that
the death rate was 63 lower
than it would have been
if there had not been vaccinations
now
isn't that a pretty big difference
between
the vaccinations are killing people
versus they saved 20 million people
so 20 million is like more than three
times the holocaust
so our difference of opinion known in
reality just just hold this in your mind
our differences of opinion on what's
real
differ by three times the size of the
holocaust
right holocaust was 6 million something
but we have a 20 million
death difference of opinion
20 million death difference
that's the world we're in there there's
nothing we can't disagree with anymore
right
now if i had to guess
uh i would think that it's very unusual
that we could get to this point in
history
without knowing for sure that the
vaccinations
made a difference
do you think we could get to this point
in history
without knowing
because the medical community seems
pretty unified
and when i say that i know they're
rogues yes they're rogue doctors but is
it true that the
the consensus official opinion of every
major industrial country is that
vaccinations worked really well
worked meaning save people's lives not
worked in terms of slowing the spread
is that wrong
is there can anybody give me um
a government source from a major
government that said the vaccinations
didn't work
is there any government source
bulgaria
denmark i don't think so but if you have
if you have something like that
send it to me okay
because those who think the vaccinations
didn't work
and and frankly i don't know how would i
know
i mean i there's nothing i believe
anymore in terms of data
but
that's a really big discrepancy 20
million saved versus your opinion that
people died because of it
yeah
hard to explain that difference
doesn't mean i'm right just means it's
hard to explain
um
and there's also a study that said one
year after recovering from initial
infection
survivors had a 72 percent higher risk
of heart failure
so there is some data that says there's
way greater risk if you get
um covet
to get a heart attack later much greater
risk than the vaccinations themselves
say this official data do you think it's
true
do you believe the do you believe this
study
that the people who got coveted are 72
more likely to get a heart attack later
or do you believe that it's a fake data
and that really people are dying from
the vaccinations themselves
uh
because it probably should be easy to
separate the people who didn't get a
vaccination
and compare them to the other people who
didn't get a vaccination but one you
know some of them were infected
it feels like an easy thing to test but
um i do not believe these this data
i do not believe this data do you
i don't believe it i mean it might be
true i'm not saying it's false i'm just
saying it's just sort of thing i don't
believe
all right did you see the uh
there was an interview surprise
interview with
joe rogan and mark zuckerberg
and
and rogan asked zuckerberg about the
hunter laptop story
and zuckerberg said that the fbi
did talk to facebook
and told them in advance that they're
expecting some russian disinformation
now they did not say specifically that
the laptop would be russian
disinformation but they just said hey
watch out for some russian
disinformation
and then in the news
they labeled the hunter laptop
disinformation
so now what what would the facebook fact
checkers do
if if 50 intel people say it's real it's
real that it's disinformation
what is facebook going to do
they're gonna have to go with the
official word right
so apparently they didn't ban it
um talk of the laptop they just
suppressed it
which he says directly
they suppressed it from being spread as
widely as it would be
what do you think of that
is facebook bad for having done that
keep in mind it was the government
that told them this was fake information
the government
i feel like if the government
tells you something is fake
you have to take that a little bit
seriously
it turns out they were lying
so
uh and then i guess facebook handled it
differently than other platforms
but it's pretty damning
i'm not so sure it's damning about
facebook as it is about the fbi
i mean it does show you that the fbi is
effectively trying to run the country
that's what it seems to me
all right
there's a movie called my son hunter
a hunter biden biopic
and
uh
i guess gina carano was in it as a
secret service agency
and so it shows it purports to show the
you know the sordid life of hunter biden
i'm really
i'm really against this movie
like th this is one of the lowest things
i've seen in public
now if the election was over uh fine
yeah that's fine
but here's a guy who has not yet been
not yet gone through the legal system
there might be some investigations about
him
and
i i just think this is messed up
i think it's messed up to have a movie
framing you and you don't get a chance
to respond to the movie
i feel as though the movie should be
legally banned
i feel like hunter should have some
recourse
to ban it
and the reason would be
justice
because would you would you want to go
into a situation where you might have
some legal
risk
and before you go in for your legal risk
there's a movie that's designed just to
defame you
and the and the the movie is out in the
public
i know i i feel like he should have some
legal recourse
to
you know at the very least have his
have his uh stuff handled by people
who've never seen the movie
but
i you know i get freedom of speech
i get first amendment
and so maybe there's just nothing to do
about it
but as a people maybe we should use our
own free speech to say you shouldn't
watch it until after the elections
i mean obviously people are gonna watch
it anyway but i i think that'll be my
decision
i think i won't watch it until after the
election and if it's still interesting
i'll watch it i'll probably see all the
clips before that but
the problem is that
a movie is visual
and it's very powerful
and this thing is going to move your
opinion because it's powerful and
because it's a movie
and that's very unfair
to hunter biden
now if it sounds like i'm defending
hunter biden i'm not
i'm defending a citizen
if you were the citizen in in in this
situation if you were in hunter biden
situation and somebody made a whole
movie
about you
how much do you think the the dialogue
in the movie is accurate
you know when they make a movie they
they make up the dialogue right
they make up the dialogue because nobody
was there that remembers exactly who
said what so it's going to be an
entirely fake movie
which they will allege is closer to
truth than it possibly could be with
what they could possibly know
and
i mean this seems like the worst
the worst offense against justice that
i've ever seen
hyperbole but you know what i mean
now
if there's somebody here who says
freedom of speech that's the end of the
story i'd say okay
it might be the end of the story
i i i don't i'm not going to push back
hard against somebody who says hey yeah
it's it might be repulsive but free
speech
maybe that has to be the winning
argument
i i wouldn't push against that that
might have to be the winning argument
just free speech
but
you do get that it's horrible what's
being done to him
and you wouldn't want this being done to
you
and that's independent of what he has or
has not done or what he is or is not
guilty of
this is just lucky icky we should not be
in favor of this
you should not support that movie that's
that's my opinion
um
this uh student load and forgiveness
thing is silly
because there isn't
here's my opinion there isn't the
slightest chance this can happen
how many of you think that
uh
joe biden as president is going to raise
our taxes by 300 billion dollars
by using the obscure coveted
excuse
when the pandemic's basically over
you you don't think the supreme court
is going to stop
it even nancy pelosi says the president
can't do that
yeah
you're sure biden researched it well
they did research it and they have a
they have a legal argument but it's not
a legal argument that could possibly
stand up in the supreme court
now isn't that isn't the problem that
there's nobody who would have standing
to bring the
bring it don't i have standing
because according to the news
my personal taxes
because of my income range my personal
taxes would go up roughly the amount of
one entire college education for a
person
that's just my taxes so basically i
would be paying for an entire college
education
for one person
you know over time
now i paid for my entire college
education
i had some scholarships actually so
full of full disclosure
but i didn't have any loans
you know my my mother worked on an
assembly line
wiring speakers
her job was to stand there all day and
put a copper wire around a magnet
just use an assembly line making
speakers
and she did that
so that my siblings and i could go to
college
and then worked other jobs as well so
she basically had one rule for us you're
going to college
that that was my mother's one rule
you're going to college that's it
basically there was only one rule two
rules
yeah you had to be home at five o'clock
for dinner and you're going to college
that's it
now
i was not getting all worked up about
this tax because it just seemed like
another
another unfair thing that is the tax
code because the tax code is completely
unfair every part of it is unfair to
somebody
somebody likes it and it's unfair to
somebody everything
so i wasn't too interested in it until i
saw that i would be paying for
somebody's entire college education
i had no idea it was going to be that
high a tax
it's really pretty rugged and even in
the middle class you might be paying a
few thousand extra dollars for somebody
else's
college so
um first of all it's offensive
we all know that that's the obvious
thing
but how in the world
is the supreme court going to let a
president raise your taxes
if it were still an emergency i'd say
sure
but it's obviously not
still an emergency
um
so
i know i here's my here's my take
there's no way it's going to happen
how many agree with me my take is
there's no way it's going to happen
agree
yeah and here's what i think i think
that the news is treating like treating
it like it might happen so they can
generate news
i think the news knows this isn't going
to happen
now if it does happen
and the next president is trump
look how much power they just gave the
next president
whoever it is
because if you could just make up a tax
and you know tie it to some obscure law
that or
obscure emergency that obviously isn't
appropriate right now if you can do that
then the president can just ignore the
congress and do whatever the he
wants so there's no way this is going to
work
to me this looks like fake news
top to bottom
it looks like the real play is to get
the republicans to say no
or to get the republican appointed
supreme court to say no
i think this is all about getting
getting somebody to get on record and
saying no
that's what it looks like
so it looks like a completely
illegitimate
play
all right um
so what do you think that redacted
affidavit is going to look like so i
guess any moment now we'll see the
redacted affidavit is there any doubt
what that is going to produce
don't we all know exactly what's going
to happen
it's going to be something that the left
says here it is the smoking gun
and the right is going to say we don't
know what's behind those redacted things
there's nothing here
yeah some of you are going to see
the worst thing in the world and some of
you will see nothing
if we know that that's going to happen
why even bother
i suppose it's better than having adam
schiff tell tell us what he saw in this
gif
so this is a way to beat the shift in
the skiff play but basically it's just
going to be a national rorschach test
literally it's going to be a bunch of
ink blots
in which we'll all have our own
interpretation
redacted affidavit is your next band
name that's a good band name redacted
affidavit
yeah
all right
um did you see the
there were some apologies because
somebody accidentally let ben shapiro
attend a public event
so somebody named the podcast movement i
guess it was some kind of podcasters
big convention
and ben shapiro
showed up and you know took some selfies
with people and stuff
and the podcast movement
to twitter said
hi folks we owe you an apology
before sessions kick off of the day
yesterday afternoon ben shapiro briefly
visited the pm 22 expo area near the
daily wire
booth
though he was not registered or expected
we take full responsibility for the harm
done by his presence
what
what what harm was done by his presence
and you know i think ben shapiro tweeted
it around with some video of him at the
event
and you see the video it's all these
people who love them who are coming up
and asking if they can have their
picture taken with them
that's it
that's it
he went to a place where people loved
him and they they took their picture
with him and they left
the horrors
how can we allow this man to
be free in public
all right
i would like to give the joke of the day
award to lisa booth who tweeted this
i want you to listen carefully
it's the best joke of the month you
ready
lisa booth tweets
what if corn pop was just trying to
protect the children
pretty good
that's pretty good
what if corn pop was just trying to
protect the children
so the story of
joe biden taking a shower with his
daughter is still the news
i don't know what to think about that
frankly
do you know what is the most common way
i am described in in the year 2022
here's the most common way people
describe me
you know even if you don't like the many
many ways that adams has been completely
wrong
about so many things and never
apologizes and never admits it
this one time probably by luck he got
one right
that's the common way people are
explaining me
amazingly although he's wrong and crazy
so many times
this one thing
is weirdly makes sense
and so here's the question i ask you
why are you so sure i was wrong about
the other stuff
stop it you're embarrassing me over on
locals they're talking about my iq and
it's just embarrassing me
you're embarrassing me
it's
some people say it's 186 some people say
it's 185 but
i don't think you could believe either
one of them
just rumors it's just rumors
all right
um
but here's something i would ask you to
do and something i
do if i have a strong opinion and i see
that uh let's say it's about the law
and then alan dershowitz disagrees with
me
i don't know how often that's happened
but
but if i saw that happen
i would immediately say to me to myself
oh i changed my opinion
i'll change my opinion to whatever
dershowitz says because he's almost
always right on the legal stuff
is there anybody who would do that for
me
is there anybody who would say you know
my opinion was solidly x
but then adam said
opposite of that
so now i'm going to rethink my
opinion mostly no
some yeses
mostly knows
not once says tom
not once
well let me ask you this how many of you
have ever heard me say something
that was surprisingly insightful
now you can still allow that i'm wrong
99 of the time
so that's still that's still available
to you
but how many of you have ever heard me
say something you said huh
that was strangely insightful
anybody
well there are you know 2800 people
watching so must be something you're
watching for
so here's the question you should ask
yourself
are you really so sure i'm wrong about
the other stuff
whatever the other stuff is
i would submit to you
that my personal experience is that 95
percent of the people who think i'm
wrong
about any topic
don't understand what i said about it
would you accept that estimate
my personal estimate is that 95 percent
of the people who who think they
disagree with me are actually dealing
with some out of context statement it's
not what i think
now if you know that 95 of the people
who disagree with me are actually
working on the wrong information why
would you think that doesn't apply to
you
shouldn't your most logical
first thought be
oh
if he had some insightful thoughts about
this other stuff that i agreed with
but this other one looks like a wacky
opinion
shouldn't your first thought be
i don't fully understand the opinion or
is that a context
it should be
now if i had never said anything that
you thought was insightful
and then you heard me say something that
was wack
the most reasonable explanation would be
well he never said anything that's smart
here's another one
but if you've ever heard me say anything
insightful
and then you hear something that's just
totally bad crazy
is it the most likely explanation
that you heard it wrong
or that you're interpreting it not quite
the way i meant it it might be my fault
right i'm not saying it's your fault it
could be something i didn't say clearly
but shouldn't that be your first
impression
that probably you heard it wrong
and if not why not
because people don't suddenly get smart
let me put it this way
if somebody
um
there's a guy i used to work with
he might be the exception to the rule
and
what we used to say about him is that he
would say like three brilliant things
and then one thing that was so dumb you
couldn't believe it
and we always tried to understand how in
the world could he say three brilliant
things and then one dumb thing
but then years later i asked myself
how i know that one thing was done
maybe it was me
how could somebody say
the fourth one's just dumb
agree with and then one smart thing
with
but it's not really that common
that people will do
some really smart things and then a
really dumb thing
almost always it means you don't
understand what they meant
so
i'll just put that then there
now somebody's saying sam harris has a
counter example
sam harris i think uh deserves a
a try to clarify his opinion so i guess
he's got a new podcast out
in which he is clarifying his trump
opinions i haven't heard it
but don't you think that if you hear his
opinions you'll have a different sense
than maybe you have right now
right he's a perfect example of somebody
if you hear sam harris say something
that doesn't make any sense at all
you have to ask yourself if maybe the
problem's on your end
now when it comes to trump there really
is a trump derangement syndrome
in fact bill barr said this in the
interview just recently he said trump
derangement syndrome is real
and i loved hearing bill barr say that
because he's not exactly a fan of the
president or president trump he's not a
fan
so when he says tds is real
that sounds pretty credible
um well i see some people are quite
angry at the possibility the problem
could be at their end
does it make you angry to think that the
possibility could be that the problem
could be at your end
because if it makes you angry to think
that that's possible
then you have no hope of being
independently
intelligent
because you're dealing on emotion not
intelligence
if you have any emotion over the thought
that you might be wrong
sort of
in concept not not even a specific wrong
but you just might be wrong in general
if that makes you mad
you're probably not equipped for
intellectual conversations
um
you admire my work ethic
i'm not sure you should
and so i spent probably
i don't know i i spent close to eight
hours yesterday
trying to sit in my chair for 30 minutes
and i
that's about all i could manage
and the reason is i can't sit in my
chair
um it's because the house is empty if at
the moment
so it's i don't know if it's just a
personal thing
does anybody have that problem that if
your house is completely empty
that you can't you can't sit still
you have to leave because
there might be people outside the house
it's it's really hardy i'm an introvert
so i can spend a lot of time alone i can
spend a lot of time alone but i can only
do it if i know that i don't have to
if it happens accidentally that i'm
alone i don't like it at all
try a standing desk i've tried that
doesn't work for me
yeah
buy another hottie
you know
that's not a bad idea
um
please go see other people
has anybody become less
social since the pandemic
because it's not that i yeah it's not
like
yeah i feel like i lost something
important
in the pandemic
because i find myself not wanting to
socialize
and that's sort of different
because even even
you know
even though i like being alone i've
always liked to socialize
and
i have to admit this week i've been
thinking about myself i'm not even sure
i want to have a conversation with a
person in person
um
writing wilson
oh you're writing a website the place
cafe background noise so i've tried
doing that i tried playing uh like
restaurant cafe sounds
and it doesn't work at all i don't know
why
i have to turn it off right away
but if you're in an actual
cafe or restaurant it's actually easy to
concentrate
i wrote an entire book sitting in a
booth of a restaurant
i owned the restaurant so i could stay
there as long as i wanted
but it was so easy to write during lunch
so as soon as the lunch noise started i
could write like crazy
and as soon as the lunch died down it
was just sort of the you know ordinary
noise
hard to write
well during marriage we didn't have
common friends too much so
start playing pickleball
yeah i don't know
i i feel like nothing seems interesting
anymore
have you noticed that things are less
interesting
does anybody notice that
no
i don't think it's the news
it's like tv is not interesting movies
are not interesting
right
well this is still interesting of course
this is the best thing that ever
happened to you
is it depression i don't know it might
be
i do worry that i do worry that there's
like some mild depression thing going on
like i don't feel it's not weighing on
me or anything
but i suppose there's a
you know lots of
variation there
uh
this is saving your day
let's go back to this
how's it saving your day
you've talked yourself out of falling in
love
that's true
yeah you know
um
let me tell you where i'm at
when you when you come out of a
relationship
have you ever had this happen
where for a while you can see the
machinery too clearly
and that in order to get into another
relationship you need to
essentially fool yourself again
you need to empty you need to enter the
hypnosis again
because if you were thinking clearly you
wouldn't do any things that people do
when they form relationships
and you so you have to talk yourself out
of thinking clearly to even
to even have those experiences
but when you just get out of a
relationship you can see clearly
and
it's it's very uh
it's very let's say
impactful on your choices
i don't know so somebody said why can't
i just you know make friends
and i like people
you know i like
i like friends
but there's something i just don't feel
like it right now and i don't know why
like today
i could easily find some people to be
with i have actually i have an
invitation that that i said no to
um
it has nothing to do with the people or
the event or anything
i just can't wrap my head around
spending time with people at the moment
somebody says just depression but i
don't i don't feel depressed i know what
depression feels like
i mean you know it's that
you just
you don't want to walk up the stairs
kind of feeling i don't have that i've
got plenty of energy
if i had low energy
then i would think maybe it's depression
but i don't my energy is fine
but i'm getting a lot of work done in my
book so it's all good
by the way the book i'm working on
i'm almost worried how much impact it's
going to have
like i'm worried it will have too much
impact
and here's why
um i i boiled in the book i'm doing a
bunch of reframes you know how to look
at something differently but a reframe
that will give you an advantage
and some of the reframes are so powerful
that's almost like a book of spells
because they're all one sentence
reframes so it's literally
let me let me take literally back
i'm overusing literally
it's like
a book of magic like literally a
sentence you could say that could change
your your life or somebody else's
and i'll give you an example
uh one of the one of the examples is
you've heard me talk about it
um
a reframe for drinking is that alcohol
is poison
so just instead of thinking of it as an
entertainment you just say alcohol is
poison and a number of people who heard
me repeat that saw it in a book
stop drinking
now could you imagine one sentence that
would stop people from drinking
but that's real that actually happened
one sentence alcohol is poison
just a simple reframe
and i don't know how many people but i'm
guessing dozens
based on my feedback i don't have an
actual account but lots of people at
least dozens
have told me that they stopped drinking
almost immediately with one sentence
now i'm not talking about alcoholics
because addiction is a different problem
i'm just talking about people who wanted
to modify their lifestyle in some way
but didn't have an addiction
yeah okay here's the thing about
reframes which i go over i'll go over in
the book if you think that a reframe has
to be true
then you're going to miss all the magic
reframes don't need to be true in fact
they're usually not
they're more often not true
they just have to work
and the reason that a reframe works is
that words carry their own power
so if you put some words into people's
heads
you're reprogramming them
and you can do it to yourself you can
put words into your own head
consciously
so words have their own power like a
little programming unit if you put
enough programming units in in the right
order you reprogram yourself
that's it
um
do you think democrats or republicans
are better at reframes
you'd have to give me some examples
are democrats or republicans better at
reframing
because they both do it all the time
somebody's saying the democrats are
better at it
yeah
i but i think it's closer to a fair
fight now you know why
do you know why the republicans are
better at framing now than they used to
be
yeah me
it's the obvious
and
um
[Music]
there are at this point there are so
many people who have read my books on or
read my book on uh
on the election and persuasion and have
watched the live streams
um
i've taught so many
right-leaning people how to how to
handle reframing
i'd be surprised if republicans aren't
better at it
what's the difference between a reframe
and a narrative
well a narrative is
more like a story
and a reframe is usually the the fast
summary
so they can they could be overlaid uh
they could be overlapping
but the thing with the narrative is um
unless you're just lying
which a lot of them are they're just
lies
uh
so i'm sorry i saw a question that
diverted me there for a moment so a
narrative is more of the long form and
the
uh the reframe doesn't need to be true
a narrative tries to be true but you
know a lot of more lies but with a
reframe you're not lying
if you're doing it in a productive way
you're not necessarily lying but it
doesn't have to be true
it just works
right now unfortunately in politics
that's the same thing they use reframes
that aren't true
but they worked
they work
you know the uh
the fine people hoax is a reframe
so instead of saying that he was talking
about uh any people who were there were
not racist they just said oh he's
definitely talking about racist
and then you say no no
there are people there who are not
racist and then they say well but they
were marching with racists so
and then you say no they weren't
marching with them well but they were
the racists they said no they weren't
with them they were physically quite far
away from them well but they came to an
event organized by racists
and you say
but there were also religious people
there and antifa and police and medical
people and they all came to a racist
thing for their own reasons
and so some people who like statues also
came for their own reasons
and then they get mad at you because
you've taken away all the reasons
well no that is the wrongest thing
anybody ever said none your business
somebody said that a reframe is self
sophistry
sophistry
by my way of thinking is something
useless
a reframe will change your
change your life
sophistry is literally the opposite of a
reframe so when you said reframe equals
self-sophistry that was exactly the
opposite of smart
do i believe in elves
so what makes reframes good or bad is
the intent and the character of the
person using it
that is correct
a reframe is a tool
it can be used for good or evil that is
correct
a book will not be out for christmas it
might be written by christmas
is a reframe self-hypnosis
in a way
yes
yeah so the trouble is i use hypnosis
uh in a wider
sense than other people do
so for me hypnosis is anything you're
saying that's persuasive and uses some
of the tools of persuasion
it doesn't mean you're going to a trance
um
affirmations are a form of reframe
you could stretch the definition for
that i guess
uh
who's this bald vaxton childless guy
let me ask you this
a lot of people especially on the right
believe that reproducing
is the ultimate win
that if you're if your genes have been
reproduced if you've had biological
children
that that's sort of the ultimate win
and i wouldn't disagree with that
because
that would be one way to keep score
right
and if somebody says i'm way more
successful because i had a child
and you did not have a child i would say
well if that's the way you're keeping
score
okay
but why would you keep score
why
what what is the logic or the reason
behind passing your genes alone
why
i understand that people want to do it
and i understand it's a biological
impulse
but have you taken it to another level
where there's a why
because i've never seen the sense to it
expand your mind well that's so selfish
okay
if you have good genes you should pass
them along why
why you're going to be dead
scott is an emotional wreck
compared to what
if i'm an emotional wreck
compared to what
all right
is it ego so in in my view reproduction
is um something that you do if your ego
requires it
and mine never did
and that's it
another
obviously you need to reproduce to keep
the economy healthy to keep civilization
moving forward but the fact is
it seems to me that if you're helping
the people who are here you're doing
just as much for civilization as if you
created a new one
yeah and some would say that having a
child is the ultimate narcissistic
thing you have to create yourself
because you can't imagine not having
more of you to which i've always said
you know less of me would be fine
i think a little less of me would be
just just what the world needs
uh i need a woman to help me keep
perspective
how many people think that's true
how many people think i need a woman to
help me keep perspective
all right
why not continue uh
but why
so so somebody's asking me why wouldn't
i have kids that's not the right
question
the question is why
so it's not why not
because you you could why not everything
that you don't do
you need a why
now i do believe that people have you
know great satisfaction from it and all
that
please don't have kids
yeah you don't want my kids running
around
but it is true that one of my relatives
had the highest iq of all presidents
john quincy adams
true story
lost unwanted divorces lost
uh so somebody so how many of you had
divorces during the pandemic or breakups
breakups or divorces during the pandemic
go
all right
number of you did
no no no yes no
all right
and
no but i'm willing to learn
oh somebody broke up right before the
pandemic oh
wow
some of you got closer
well
now let me ask you this
would the world be better off if i had
had children and never wrote any books
because i probably wouldn't be doing
this if i had children
oh mixed opinion there huh i guess it
depends how much you like the books
somebody says i have a poor self-image
really
or is it just accurate
uh you'd be better off at the expense of
the world
yeah i can tell you that
i would not be exterior focused if i had
kids
you agree
if i had kids i would not be exterior
focused but i'm very exterior focused
see what i can see what i can do for
other people
well here's the most interesting uh
comment i saw the day uh
machiavelli's underbelly said this
have you ever heard the
the saying that uh the two most
um certain things in life are death and
taxes
the two things you can always depend on
death and taxes well machiavelli's
underbelly wonders if that's true
that death and taxes
might be something that both end
and i think that's actually possible
i i can see people being immortal
and i can see taxation ending
both of those seem entirely possible in
fact if you went far enough into the
future it's guaranteed i think
quasi-immortal yeah maybe quasi-mortal
well that is all i have for you today
i think it was a highlight of your day
hard to imagine it could get better from
here
but
it might
and i gotta tell you that the dilbert
comic is getting edgier
so there was one that uh
i i had just flat turned down the other
day
but
you can see the original the one that
got turned down on the locals platform
so the only place you can see the ones
that were too naughty for the newspapers
will be on locals
that's right my books are my children
all right
kids are not for everyone right
all right
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later youtube your comments were
interesting today so thank you for that
