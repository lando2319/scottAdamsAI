good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization if
you don't count my humming that really
doesn't help at all but if you like your
experience already quite amazing I think
you'd agree to go up to levels that
people can't even explain there are no
words to explain them all you need to do
to do that is to grab a cup or mug or a
glass a tanker cheler Stein a canteen
joger flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now
go so
good yeah that's so
good well let's talk about the biggest
tragedy and I feel that this is the
problem that is not just in the news but
this is actually come into your
home I
mean unless it was just me but I stayed
up all night
crying because we have not selected a
new Speaker of the House poor Jim Jordan
he's lost three votes so far doesn't
look like it's getting closer and so
every day that we survive with a speaker
of the
house I feel we're that much closer to
doom and you know the evidence is
everywhere you know I mean just look
around
um because there's no speaker of the
house the problems are
um
okay there are no
problems but theoretically there could
be and I think we should worry about
that the theoretical problems that we
can't even
imagine now is am I wrong or do we need
one rule that would fix
everything you you want to hear one law
that would fix Congress no not term
limits that might
help but here's one that would actually
be possible if they don't come up with a
budget by the time they're supposed to
come up with a budget all the budgets
are cut evenly by let's say
5% and and that's it there's no
continuing
resolutions well why would you do a
continuation of something that wasn't
working and would lead you to
Doom now I don't know if it's 5% or 15%
what the right number is but there is a
right number there is a number that if
you can't get it done it just gets cut
5% and I don't think they would ever get
it done you know they would argue
forever but but you know we could maybe
cut this budget but that money should go
over to this other place you know what
you could do you could just get over it
you can just work with what you have you
could do that like everybody else does
you work with what you have you don't
just get
more so every day that we don't have a
speaker makes me
happy and I don't feel good about
that because you know like I say I'm
watching Thomas Massie uh trying to uh
you know get a get a speaker he seems to
think it's
important but I don't know if it is the
longer we go without one maybe it's
telling us something that we should have
listened to you know maybe we're
learning something from this that's
actually important so let's see what
happens
well in surprising news but maybe not so
surprising RFK
Jr um has come out in favor of
reparations
reparations now here's what's
interesting about
that that takes him down to zero
Republican votes doesn't it remember all
those people who said uh hey he's going
to take votes away from
Trump really you think anybody who is in
favor of reparations will get one vote
even one from a
republican
no you will not get one vote I mean if I
have anything to do about it because now
it's you know now it's serious there
there were a number of uh RFK Jr
policies that I didn't like but I
thought to myself you know but if he got
president at least he has good character
and I feel like he tell the truth likes
his country right so I thought you know
maybe I could live with not having
exactly all the policies that I think
are the good
ones but no reparations is uh that's
just a hard no there there's there's no
negotiating there's no wiggle room
that's just a no times a thousand no no
no you are not going to be the
president so that pretty much guarantees
Trump will get elected but it also I
think guarantees that you can stop
saying hey maybe RFK Jr should be his
attorney general nope that's not
happening now so he's uh he is now just
a spoiler for the Democrats which will
be kind of interesting to watch well I
think the biggest story and you would
agree if you saw the recent video of
President
Biden I call him bodus because you know
I'm an Insider you could call him him
President Biden but I call him
pus well
pus I don't know if the video was weird
or the lighting
angle but everybody else who saw the
video saw the same thing I did which is
there was something different about his
chin the the pus chin yeah it looked
like instead of his regular chin which
is not his regular chin would not be too
different from mine the way we've always
seen before kind of kind of just a
normal little
chin and but for some reason the last
time we saw it uh it had this big cleave
like like a boob cleavage in the middle
so that the two sides of the chin were
hanging down like
balls so his chin became like chin
balls now it didn't look like there was
a surgery or
anything but he has chin balls it was a
big mystery it's like why does he have
balls on his chin now I if I were going
to look into this the first place I
would
look I would check his balls to see if
it looks like a chin because it could be
one of these Switcheroo things that
happens right you wake up one day and
you're like oh god oh no oh
no you know s of that
situation but in the short until we
figure out medically what's going on why
his chins became balls I think we should
temporarily stop calling him
podus not pus
anymore no
scrotus
scrotus I think he should just be
scrotus until we figure this
out well Mark
Dice a conservative guy did a uh Street
thing where he was asking Democrats on
the street I'm not sure where it was was
it in the Northwest somewhere some uh
some democrat oncl but he was asking
Democrats just ordinary Democrats ones
that look like you know they're
barbecuing moms and dads and PTA just
ordinary looking ones so I'm not talking
about green-haired people right no
nobody who's you know obviously antifa
nothing like that I'm talking about your
most or AR you know chubby Americans
walking down the sidewalk and Mark Dice
stops him and he says that uh he's
asking him to sign a petition to jail
all Trump supporters who say 2020
election was
stolen jail them now he says jail them
very clearly now not for Free Speech but
jail them if they were if they said the
2020 election was stolen do you know how
many people he got to sign that petition
to jail to jail Trump's
supporters for uh for free
speech well I don't I didn't see a
percentage so you know I don't know what
percentage they would but there were a
number of ordinary people who signed it
enthusiastically enthusiastically they
signed it they were really happy about
it
now do you ever ask yourself how did the
citizens of Germany ever go along with
with Hiller like how how in the world
did you convince Ordinary People to to
support a Hitler likee regime and the
answer is right here the answer is right
here it turns out it's moronically easy
to convince otherwise good people to be
monsters you just have to demonize the
other side until it doesn't seem like
it's
monstrous now if I if I said to you hey
uh step on that
bug assuming you didn't love bugs you
might just step on it or you wouldn't
even think twice you swat a fly you know
why you would SWAT a fly without
thinking twice is just a freaking fly
what's it going to do go C crawl around
on crap for a while I mean you don't
care about a fly but that apparently
that's what the news has done to Trump's
supporters who would doubt the election
anyway it's it's dehumanized them to the
point where taking their freedom away
doesn't even seem like a big move it's
like oh yeah give me that give me that
petition I'll sign it that was pure evil
when you're watching these ordinary
citizens just probably good people 99.9%
of the time but because of that little
Corruption of their minds that little
brainwashing uh thing that's been going
on for several years in the United
States they actually
believed that jailing people who would
look and talk exactly like them somebody
who could attend their barbecue and
would be perfectly acceptable about
except for this one opinion that they
thought maybe the election wasn't secure
and they would go to jail
according to the guy
barbecuing now does that blow your mind
it's mind-blowing but if you think it's
surprising you haven't been paying
attention you remember when I told you
that Republicans would be
hunted and you said well that's crazy
come on they're not going to be hunted
these are people signing a petition to
put him in
jail that's pretty hunted that's that's
pretty hunted I mean you could argue
about the technical definition of the
word hunted but that's not really a real
argument in this case that's that's just
avoiding the
conversation so that's
scary but uh don't worry about your free
speech because uh let's see if there are
any other examples where it would be
threatened oh yeah a prot trump Meme
Maker got seven months in jail for a
joke that's a real thing that happened
now of course how did they put him in
jail for a
joke well it's the government all they
have to do is say it wasn't a
joke that's it the government just had
to say we don't get the joke and they
can put him in
jail now let's see was it a joke so what
he did was he had some meme that other
people copied I think the fact that
other people copied it and boosted it
probably made it much worse for him but
his meme you said uh you don't need to
vote if you're uh Hillary Hillary
Sporter what which which election was it
was it Biden or Hillary I forget but um
he said you don't have to vote you can
just text in your vote so it was way
back in the Hillary days right you just
text your vote now of course that's not
a real thing so if people tried to text
their votes instead of going to
vote you know you might have erased
their
votes but I can't imagine anybody used
that number because it was a fake number
do you think anybody texted that got
nothing that would look like a
confirmation and then didn't vote
because they thought the text worked
because remember there would be no
confirmation because it wasn't even a
real
number they' probably just get an error
or nothing do you think you would feel
like you voted and do you think nobody
would have talked you out of it or told
you it was a
joke yeah now it's a joke because you
think real people will believe it all
right sort of it wouldn't really be
funny if you thought nobody in the world
would believe it it's only the fact that
some people would believe it that makes
it a practical joke right it's a
practical joke as opposed to a joke
because you're not TR trying to get
people to laugh you get them to go do
something and then you laugh at them for
doing it because you you believe that I
can't believe you believe you can text
the vote so was it uh an
ill-advised practical joke I would say
yes given the circumstances it was
probably ill advised but that's not how
Free Speech works you can say
ill-advised things without the
government putting you in jail you know
maybe your fellow citizens won't like it
and punish you for it but the government
isn't supposed to put you in jail for
poor choice of words but they are and of
course the its election interference
would be the charge now do you think
that if Trump had not been the candidate
and we were not in the context of trying
to protect the election Integrity do you
think that he would have gotten any kind
of a well even even that he would go on
to trial no now to me this is obviously
just haunting Trump supporters he's
hunted they found an
excuse that they could torture until
they can say all right we got a reason
put this one in jail what does that do
to Future Trump supporters who might
think hey this would be a funny joke
maybe Think Twice It's a chilling effect
but I think it also is a dopamine a hit
for the people putting him in jail my
guess is if you hook monitors up to the
uh people who voted to convict him that
they would have gotten a
charge they would have thought oh we're
making a book or world a better place
we'll get this Trump SP feels good feels
good that's what I think it was yep I
think at least half of them were turgid
when they voted to put that guy in
jail so um it's the Googs as cernich
says um did you know that the
ADL opposes a group called Jews against
Zionism it so Jews against
Zionism so there would
be Jewish people who were opposed to is
Israel I don't know existence or policy
or
something um and the ADL says they're a
hate group are they who are they
hating what exactly is the group of
people they're hating it seems to me
that the people they're hating are
people that that uh the ADL
likes as opposed to protecting them
because of their ethnicity I kind of
thought that they were about you know
ethnic differences being discriminated
against but no that seems uh entirely
related to policy so if you have the
wrong policy according to the ADL you'll
be labeled a hate
group now I remind you that the
ADL labeled me uh a holocaust
denier you think they did it because I
was a threat or or even that I had that
belief of course I don't have that
belief I don't even know anybody who has
that belief I never even heard of it
honestly in the real world I've never
even heard of it have you have you ever
met anybody who thought the Holocaust
was actually a hoax oh yeah
have I've never met
anybody well I was sign of a ran I
suppose but in person I've never been
met even met anybody who has that
opinion but yeah so the ADL is a
discredited uh ridiculous group you
should not pay attention to uh more
evidence that the Chinese economy is in
trouble I guess they have a lot of debt
at their local level uh and and they are
uh even more debt riddle than the United
States which is interesting because I
thought the United States was in the
most trouble debt wise of the big
countries but no China is actually much
worse but some say China's Deb is owed
to itself so that's different
maybe so there doesn't seem to be
anybody who can look at China and tell
us if they can make it through this
situation big debt problem and declining
population and some decoupling going on
with other countries us primarily
but
uh they could crumble any
time or maybe
never but
um I think their future is largely not
positive after after
today all right uh do you remember when
I said after this horrible Hamas attack
on Israel and the the barbarism that was
involved was beyond anything you could
imagine
and I said that it's a sign that they're
taking a drug called
captagon now captagon is what Isis would
take to make them Fier fearsome fighters
who are not afraid of anything but also
were not afraid to do anything in other
words you know war crimes and atrocities
so you would do it just matter of factly
if you're on this drug so it's a it's a
stimulant that makes you more effective
but also makes you care less
about anybody else's bad
situation so it turns out that uh a
captagon drug is found on the bodies of
Hamas
members so this is now
confirmed as the drug is reportedly used
and produced in Lebanon and Syria and
extremist uh sophist elements including
Isis have been known to use
it now does it all make sense now
the only thing that makes sense when you
look at the Hamas attack is if they were
zombie down and they they weren't in the
right
mind who confirmed
it not nothing from the land of war is
is uh is guaranteed but this does match
observation and I always tell you if it
matches what you're observing there's a
much better chance is real there is no
other explanation for how so many people
a thousand people could be murdering
babies but if you gave a th000 people
Capon they would go murder
babies there's only one explanation and
it's not religion religion doesn't get
you to murder of babies you know not a
thousand people at the same
time so that would be quite a stretch
without the
drug so as I've said before that Gaza
should be looked at as a medical problem
the Gaza situation you know before
during and after the actual conflict
that's happening now it's a medical
problem it's Medical in several ways
during the war it's obviously medical
because of injuries from the war and
Medical in the sense that people will
have great deal of trouble getting
nutrition and and the basics of life so
in that way it's super
medical the other way it's medical is
this captagon thing it's a drug it's a
drug addiction so they're not just
taking it they're addicted to it in all
likelihood they're
addicted so you've got drug addiction
and you've got the you know massive
injuries and nutrition problems these
are all medical problems and then you've
got the base problem which is people who
were
brainwashed into a H frame of mind where
all it took was a little captagon and
they could turned into murderous
zombies you know I don't think you and I
could be turned into murderous zombies
because we don't have the mindset to
begin with but if I had that mindset
give me a little Capon and I'm like
where's my gun got to go kill some
people so I would say that the original
brain damage in the form of
brainwashing it's almost like
a Min
virus so the idea that it's okay to go
and kill civilians in this context is a
virus it's not good for for doing it
it's not not good for what's being done
too that's the definition of a like a
problem if not good for anybody anybody
at least if some somebody was head it'd
feel like well well that's just that's
something something you know selfishness
we
understand but this is a nobody
situation that's a medic problem now
supp Tre as medical problem less than a
uh military problem You' still
need because the very first thing you
quarantine them but the quarantine
didn't work because too many people got
out you still have to work on the
quarantine though in other words it
doesn't doesn't make sense send them to
Jordan it makes sense to send them
because they have a mindset that could
infect people in those countries and
make everything worse so if you do like
a virus that must be contained then that
tells you to do of the things that you
do is approach it with some
compassion because these are medically
the the people in Hamas including Hamas
you know not just the people in Gaza but
including us they have a medal emergency
that's going on on they brain brains
been scrambled so that they can't live
with regular Society that's just brain
damage so if you treat it as brain
damage myus drug problem
nutrition um Healthcare in general then
you've got a whole set of
compassionate World friendly uh ideas
that allow you to do everything you to
do which be super
violent but you put it in a package
which is not a military package so I
think
where where isra needs to go is to start
start treating this like like brain
damage and start using words like that
because people will understand
quarantine completely oh I don't I don't
want that people get but as soon as you
say we're going to put put these people
in a open a jail because they have a
religion we don't like we're at each
other each other next that's Suddenly
It's
evil right so you can form this from
some what look like evil to some of the
world that's a debatable point I think
Defending Your Country is just
always legiate even even if it's ugly
and that's the the r should be treating
a laical
problem but just as aggressively maybe
more aggressively now if you don't like
that idea I have a second
idea this cap
Capon is
addictive so if they're taking it
they're looking for more of
it so I would give give them all they
want
I would be
dropping cap gun tablets all
over ex that I might make them a little
differently four or five Captain gun
pills I would make to
week so if you took one you'd be like oh
this supposed to be batch so you take a
take one
or one out a five I would lace with
fenel at a overdose level
because if you're you're like right Dam
my didn't do anything for me better take
a second damn it didn't do anything for
me now you're down to a pretty good
chance that the next your pop kills you
pretty a
chance do I care that I don't know is
that a is that war crime is it a war
crime to to Poise somebody's medal
supplies well they're not really
supplies are they Captain gun is a
military asset you you can you can bomb
some somebody's
artillery if it's if it's mil asset so
this drug is just like a gun it's just
like a bull it's like a missile a
military if you can corrupt it in so
doing kill the the people who use it I
don't know I don't know where the line
is on that but to me it looks looks like
something somebody probably probably
will try uh so maybe maybe get the
cartels to join us and taking out
homas I'm not not entirely serious about
about that all right
um there's a little more in free speech
what we used to think we had so there's
a recent poll by project home fair and
Innovative or anyway ped 2,000 people
and uh let's see they asked uh as people
uh people who plan to vote on for Joe
Biden
um 4% of them these are 47% of Joe
Biden's ERS say quote the government
should regulate or restrict the
expression of views consider
discriminatory or off
offensive discriminatory offensive that
the
government should regulate it not just
the platforms the private entities who
you know just want good people on on
their platform but 40% Biden people
people are opposed to freedom of
speech because that's actually the
definition of freedom of of speech is if
if you can say things that other people
other people are really offended by
that's free speech isn't saying people
agree with that Parts easy easy and 40
40% of J supporters are are not
aware that that's what Free Speech means
and stuff other people really really
hate or they don't think think is
important now I don't think they
understand the risk as soon as the
government gets to say what you can
can't
say they find reasons reasons why you
can't all kinds things it's not going
just to the few things they didn't like
it's going to apply to whatever they
want to apply to it can apply to you
next time they they don't like we you oh
we found this is
discriminatory the woke can identify
literally anything as discrimination
like say climate change has anybody that
climate
racist if you if you if the government
banned saying things were
discriminator or offensive offensive so
if somebody said no I think we should
ignore climate change and everything
fine that would that would be
RAC because it ignor ignor that climate
change would affect some groups more
than others racist is by definition so
therefore you should not not be able
toze climate change because that would
discriminatory offensive and you would
have to go to jail for that for
criticizing the science of climate
change now that's not thing
now right right now you can you want
about climate change you lose your job
but you can say what you want government
won't stop you but 47% of Biden
supporters
orders are okay the world the government
can just say anything discriminatory or
offensive so we ban It Whatever whatever
we don't
want amazing you want to be want to be
shock 35% of the people say they plan on
voting for
Trump also say government involved in
speech
regulation so it may to do with the way
the question is asked but apparently you
know around a third of the country or
more thinks says speech should cailed if
that's offensive or in somebody's
opinion
discriminatory and all speech is like
that if it's political there's almost
nothing you could in the political realm
that is not both B discriminatory
accidentally U or offensive it's
offensive to
somebody you said I think think Trump
should be
elected what would
faces of you know Tifa and other people
who don't like that just imagine their
face you just walk up and say you know
you know I think Trump should be be
reelected they'd be like a you monster
I'm
offended are he's clearly a racist say
and and therefore support him I think
you just support supported dation didn't
you you see where this goes yeah you can
literally ban anything that that matters
the only thing that safe is that are
boring that no nobody so a number of you
still are under the depression that you
have free AG let me let me tell you what
kind what kind of free spe you have you
have the free freedom to the government
agrees that's about
it anything else else that you can land
land so it looks like like the audio is
glitching on the X
platform none of platforms are working
today for
reasons right so I'm not anything about
that you could stop saying it
uh there's anting exchange on the xplat
between New
Wales of
Wikipedia and Elon
Musk and uh what about to you imagine
let's see Jimmy Wales uh and like the
contact hospitals and other fake news
that are happening right now but Jimmy
Wales says fast moving claims andoun
claims um well he's just saying saying
there are moving claims and coun
and Elon Elon Musk has removed all the
core features that they made it even
remotely possible to tell real real
journalist from
fakes what what in what world did
happen are are you aware of anything
that happened on the
xplat that have made it easier or harder
to who were the real journalists
I'm I'm pretty sure the xplatform made
it easier to know who the fists are like
a lot lot
easier Am I Wrong the reason that the
fake journalist seem seem to have more
let's say influence X is because we
found out the other ones were were fake
too does Jimmy Wales not know that Mo
most of theists most that you used to
think were valid turned out not to be
you know when you found out that their
publication was just some bias piece
trash I mean I just wonder wonder what
world Jimmy Wales lives in that's what
he's
saying now I would agree that the non
know independent people seem have a
bigger voice but it's because the people
who you used to think were credible
you've learned for sure were never
credible to begin with they they were
just an information
entity did Jimmy miss all of that does
he not know any of that context because
most people
don't the person who doesn't watch live
streams P every day you wouldn't know
that the whole system has been outed as
as rigged from top to
bottom and and well documented you you
know no weird claims or spection
involved it's pretty well well
documented all right so uh El did not
let that go so he said that
that he said fix
W this is only response fix
wedia and I responded to Jimmy well I've
talked to him a few times about fake
news on uh on
for talk to him on on on DMS
anyway we can never tell what was real
nobody ever knew what was real just
thought we
could what's new is know what's not real
just that's that's the only
thing all
right uh Victoria Secret has
announced well it's owner announced that
he's gonna fund Harvard any anymore so
Harvard be getting funded by the uh
naughty underwear
magnate um so that's another blow
to um but in addition theor
secret the compan itself has announced
their uh back to tax and that they'll
stop uh showing models who do not
present that I
guess that would you like to hear the
good good news i' like to tell you the
good news somebody got mad at me for
saying this because it was underneath a
pi picture of the woke version of the
the angel angels and let's just say all
of them were super attractive which was
the point at they were they were
selecting people intentionally who are
not the uh standard historical norms for
beauty they're trying to make a point
about
inclusive but here's my point because I
like like to put a positive spin on
things it has never been e easier to be
in the top of ATT
attractive is now available to
everybody when I was kid you know by the
time you're like five years old you look
in a mirror and and you KN where your
was for the rest of your
life you just looked in the mirror
you're like you know this is me looking
in the mirror I'm
like I know scale of 1 to
10
yes I
know SC scale one to 10 godamn it
six it's anywhere like it's just going
to be a six and I'm gonna be six forever
nothing I can do with it at the M moment
if you were
X all you'd have to do is diet and go to
the gym and you in the top 10
10% adults now that's not an exag
because you know today you could get a
lot of the stuff fixed about your body
well you can get that job have a little
fat fat pull of where you got too
much right you can do kind things with
your hair if you're if you're challenge
like me shave your head head guess guess
some lace doesn't work for me but you
can do
it so if you fixed your hair your your
hygiene fingernails nails are Tri and
clean and you've gone to the gym these
are all the most doable things in the
world and you've worked hard so you had
enough enough money so that you could
you know uh um take of maybe getting a
plastic surg surgery of minor kind being
in the top
10% really
easy and I'm that with literally this is
a joke just cting
around
yeah I'm just going to turn turn off
your platform because you're all
complaining news
um but it was nice talk to
you stream doesn't work more than Twi in
a row I'm glad I proved it to you now
