do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and boy
did you pick a good time to be here
today talk about some juicy news we got
some juicy news for you but stay around
for that and if you'd like to prepare
and I do recommend you be prepared all
you need is a cup
or a mug
or glass
or a take us take your chalices down the
canteen Joker flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join us now for the
unparalleled pleasure that don't be here
the day the thing that makes everything
better is cold simultaneous
and make sure you say ah afterwards go
ah ah delightful
well I don't know if you heard but uh
there was some news last night
ex-president Trump on CNN we'll talk
about that in a moment but first
some other palette cleansers before we
get to that
uh first headline news science is
do you need any details on that
just science is are you good
that's all you really need on that one
isn't it well there's a new study that
says a third of scientific papers may be
fraudulent
the third now we've heard that half of
published papers are not reproducible
which means but apparently a
third of the scientific papers uh
they've got some software that can look
for similarities and plagiarism and a
third of them are just copy paste stolen
from other science studies a third of
scientists are just criminals because
they have to publish or perish so
they're just like pulling bits from
other people's published work and put it
together and hope nobody knows and
apparently it works because a third of
the papers are just
just copied
so if you wanted something that would
further lower your confidence in the
expert class well there you have it
um
let me ask you this
do you remember that reparations were
big news for a while
seems like he was in the headlines every
other day or so yeah
and the committee did a bunch of
studying came up with some
recommendations and they changed their
recommendations a few times but it was
all news news news
about these are evaporations
and then Governor Newsom came out and
said uh
I'm gonna ignore all these
recommendations because uh it turns out
the reparations are about more than cash
oh no it turns out that reparations are
really if you think about it not the
cash payments you thought you were
getting not the cash payments we asked
you to study and not the cash payments
that we asked you to come up with a
framework for how we would do it no no
it's really all the stuff we were doing
anyway is the reparations and we're
doing a great job on the stuff we were
doing anyway
and now it's out of the news
and that was gone
now it might be just because there was
bigger news or something yeah maybe
it'll come back but isn't it funny
that the fake news industry can get you
all riled up about this story and as
soon as it turns completely embarrassing
The Narrative just you can't even tell
it anymore it's a story you can't even
put in the news it's just too
embarrassing
because people like me were calling this
from the beginning oh this is just a
white person trick
gonna form a committee
study it for a bunch and then say I
can't do that
it was obvious from the beginning this
was just a play
and then the play comes through it goes
just exactly the way I told you it would
that it gets ignored because it's
ridiculous
and that was the genius of the move is
it out in the reparations idea as
ridiculous without anybody telling them
it was ridiculous they just had to go
through the work of figuring it out and
presenting it and then we could all just
look at it and go oh
well that's not going to happen
and then you can move on so apparently
we're forgetting all about that
reparation stuff that's over it'll come
back but for now it's gone
um what do these four politicians have
in common besides being Democrats
President Biden
VP Harris
Senator Feinstein
is Senator fetterman
can you think of anything that those
four leaders
yes yes no no functional brain
right now am I am I just being biased
here let me ask you a question I feel
like I'm just being biased
but you can help me get out of my bias
could you name the four Republican uh
top politicians who don't have
functioning brains go
four Republicans who don't have brains
that work
[Laughter]
no Romney doesn't count he's just not
doing stuff you're like no McConnell's
brain is working fine Santos
is an interesting character but
he's not mentally disabled
Crenshaw
don't throw Crenshaw in there
hahaha
now you're just throwing in all the
names of people you don't like today
[Laughter]
all right well
how do how do we ignore the fact
that the leader of the country is
obviously mentally incompetent at least
in terms of doing a full day work
and then the backup plan
the backup plan for the president of the
United States is someone who's obviously
a public drunk
a public drug can't even keep the
drinking behind closed doors
but Cobble Harris when she appears in in
public let's stop pretending can we
let's stop pretending any that's normal
no she's drunk in public when she's
doing her job there's nobody who can be
drunk in public doing their job without
getting fired
okay name one person in the real
corporate world who could appear
multiple times drunk in public obviously
drunk obviously drunk
and and there's no repercussions it's
not even a news item
don't you think you should at least be
discussed at the highest levels of
importance
what exactly is more important than
having a leader of your country whose
brain actually functions
seems important
but we've actually been we've we've been
gasolated
as a public we've been gaslighted to the
point where four major political
entities in the United States president
vice president two major senators
and we don't care if their brains are
working
and we've been we've been talked into
that being normal
somehow somehow that just seemed okay
we'll just go on with our day
leaders don't have brains no problem
well
uh
anyway I just thought that was worth
noting
but the funny thing is no matter how
many times I say it
it won't make any difference tomorrow
nobody's going to care that the person
One Heartbeat Away from the presidency
is a public drunk
and obviously so
we're not even dealing with that we're
just just to say that doesn't exist
doesn't exist
all right it's not like we haven't had
drunk politicians before but uh I feel
like
we ought to do something about it
so
um
title of 42 ends
by the way Trump could do a lot with
that the fact that Democrats don't have
functioning brains
imagine what Trump could do with that
just naming those four people and saying
are they even trying anymore
they're not even trying
all right title 42 ends today that was
the thing that allowed the border of
control people to uh I don't keep some
people South of the Border because of
covet restrictions or something but
anyway that's ending and then all the
smart people say there'll be a giant
wave of immigrants looks like that's
going to happen
um but the news that I saw I think this
was Washington on the
Wall Street Journal
um
that we don't know how different it's
going to be actually
that is a little more complicated than
that so it seems that the Biden
Administration
approach is so is simply to reduce the
illegal part
by doing as much as you can to funnel
them towards legal ports of Entry
where they can lie about their status
and say they're all
they're all escaping from Bad situations
they're not here to get jobs
so make it easy for them to lie about
why they're here
some of them are here for the real
reason of course
but most of them would have to lie and
so we'll build an app that they can lie
and find out where to where to tell
their lie so all the process is legal
and and fine
does that feel like
yeah Trump didn't mention fencil right
does it feel like that's not even trying
yeah we're doing all these things but
all of them have the collective action
of you know whether you have to use the
app I guess it was about an app for the
immigrants
but they all have the same character
they're just trying to turn a thing
that's illegal
they're trying to Legal wash it is their
name for that
where you take something that's illegal
and everybody doesn't like the illegal
part and you just redefine it as legal
to make the problem go away
because if the people come in and do use
the app and use the appropriate
entryways and they lie to lie to the
border patrol and say oh yeah we're here
because of all the danger not because of
the jobs because all the danger
then they get in and it's legal
completely legal so so we actually
legalize lying
effectively didn't we didn't we turn
every immigrant that we let in into a
liar
not everyone some of them actually have
a real case
yeah we force them here's your first day
in the American
um sphere day one here's an app and
we're going to require you to lie on the
app
what
yeah yeah to get into the country
that's it
yeah but we require it
there's no getting around this you have
to lie to us
but you know we're lying
well not every one of you
some of you might not be lying
but you know most of us are lying right
well okay read your minds we know now
maybe
so that's a pretty weird system we got
going there we'll see how that works out
um I have a suggestion for replacing
title 42 we'll talk about Trump after
I'm done with this
um
I had an experience yesterday in which I
was trying to cancel my Xfinity
TV service but keep their internet and
and keep the phone service I wanted
those
um and I'm thinking that if we really
want to thwart the people at the border
instead of making them find an app and
somehow get a smartphone and sign up on
the app and work through the language
issues if there are any instead of doing
that which which I agree is a good first
step to thwart the immigrants make it
make them have a lot of paperwork
because apparently Biden is willing to
ship you back
if you came here without lying in your
own country first
so apparently you're supposed to go if
you're let's say some from Venezuela or
something you're supposed to go to some
place in your own country and you do
your lying there locally and then you
can legally come into the country
but if you leave your country and come
here and do the lying when you're on our
soil
totally illegal and Biden will ship you
back
makes total sense right
that where you lied makes the difference
and the Biden Administration is going to
ship your ass back if you didn't catch
the paperwork detail there
so if we're willing to deport people for
bad paperwork which is all this is
because literally they're saying the
same thing it's just they have to say it
in a different place with different
paperwork that's all but if we can
thwart them with paperwork
I think that they should hire Xfinity
to use the same people who thwart you
from canceling your TV service
let me tell you what Xfinity did
to prevent me from canceling my service
see if this sounds familiar to every
online service you've ever tried to
cancel
and I start writing down the tricks
because let me ask you this do you
remember the first time you ever tried
to buy a car as an adult
and you remember that the salesperson
had to go talk to the manager
and and they'd be gone for like an hour
and then they just do it again oh I
gotta talk to the manager again I'll be
gone for another hour and the first time
that happened you said to yourself
well that's a weird little process but
it's probably only something that
happens at this car dealership
how do you put up with it you get your
car because you really want a car then
someday you talk to a friend or you go
back again to buy another car someday
it's the same thing isn't that weird
they always have to talk to the manager
huh
and then finally you figure out that the
talking to the manager part is all part
of the wearing you down process
they're trying to wear you down they're
trying to exhaust you so you'll make
decisions that are good for them and bad
for you well Xfinity and other online
services do the same thing and there's
no question that this is intentional
but let me tell you how clever it is all
right so first if you want to cancel
Xfinity you say to yourself will I call
them or try to do it online
what do you think about when you think
about calling them
what happens to your brain and your body
oh
hopeless right you know it's hopeless
because all of the companies have made
it hopeless to call them because they
want you to use online so the first
thing I say is well I could call
but I don't want to be on the phone all
day and still not get it done
because the the risk is you spend hours
and it still doesn't get done because
you can't penetrate their calling
problem
so I go all right I'm going to use the
wrap
and then I find out that the browser
refers you to their app
I'm like all right all right but they
have more than one app
and they're phasing out of app and they
got a new app
so is it the streaming app the other app
the My Account app the one that's being
phased out or is it a new one we're
going to use the browser but the browser
tells me to go to the app I finally get
the right app and when I dig down into
the app the app says yeah if you want to
cancel you have to go to the browser
so so this is common the first time I
saw this I didn't I thought it was just
an accident but you'll find that most of
your online places when you want to
cancel the browser will refer you to the
app and the app will refer you to the
browser
I didn't believe it until I saw it three
times in a row three different companies
and there will be multiple apps and
browsers
try doing anything with uh Kaiser
three apps a browser or two there's a
business there's a personal it's
impossible
all right so but I but I decided I was
going to treat it as a competition and
not a task
if if I thought that canceling the
service was a chore
or a task
I would hate every part of it so here's
a little reframing tip you ready for
this
I reframed it as a competition
in which I was going to take as long as
it took and I was going to beat them
I didn't care what it was going to take
I I had I had an audience you know
because it was a guy working on my AV at
the time I I had an audience I had work
to do while I was waiting for the you
know the various things I have to wait
for and I just settled in and I said
 you're not going to beat
me but boy did they try wow did they try
let me tell you what other tricks
they've got
the first one was that when you sign in
to the website
after you're signed in
it redirects you to a sign in page
how many times have you seen that
just a coincidence right every time I go
to sign in someplace to cancel the sign
in
takes me to another page to sign in ah
now do you think that that was the the
second place I signed in do you think
that that was the right place no that's
the one that sent me to the app and the
app sent me back to the browser and it
turns out that the browser does not have
any menu choices neither the app nor the
browser have any many choices for
canceling
but you have to look for a long time to
figure that out so I go to Google
because I know other people have had
this problem and I Google how to cancel
and it produces a secret URL
 there's a secret URL
so I go to the secret URL and sure
enough that seems to be getting me
closer to the mix but they have lots of
options that look like it would cancel
for example one of the options is manage
your services
so you could change what services you're
ordering doesn't that seem like an
obvious place to cancel
if you're going to manage your services
you can add to them you can change them
and obviously one of the choices would
be to cancel obviously nope nope you can
only add to them
you can only upgrade
right that's it I think you could
downgrade but you can't cancel
so you have to figure that out so you
got Google searching five different apps
and browsers in play
um that of course sends you to a chat
sends you into a chat and then it tells
you you have to wait for a long time
for the chapter five people out of you
now normally I would bail out at that
point
too much time but not this time no I
came to play
I put that down I said I don't care how
long I'm going to wait I'm gonna wait
for that chat bastard to come and talk
to me sure enough the chatter finally
finally comes on
and what does the chatter do
ask me the same questions as the last
chatter
same ones
have to verify the account make sure you
who you are so they're gonna have to ask
your name and who you are and your
account numbers every time you talk to
somebody else and you're never going to
talk to the right person
so at the end of all this stuff do you
know what the chat person tells me
oh you're talking to the repair people
that's right that wasn't the right place
it was the place that they sent me to
like I didn't make it up it's exactly
where they sent me to they actually send
you to the repair place first because
it's the wrong place
and they say they can't do it now he
says he's going to transfer me to the
right place
how often does the transfer work
have you ever been transferred to the
place that can help you
[Laughter]
well it's sort of kind of worked and
then I had to wait again right I just
could put it in another queue
now here's the other trick
when you call to cancel
do their computers work
do the people you're talking to say well
my computer is working great today and
not only is my computer working but the
response time is really tight
I'll get this done and this could take
10 seconds no no they will tell you that
there's something wrong with the
computer system at that moment and they
can't possibly do this transaction
but if you waited a long time maybe they
could get it done
see they're all trying and all of this
is designed to make you give up
and under normal circumstances I would
have given up because I always have
something more important to do and and
for two years I've been telling myself I
want to cancel that service because I'm
paying for it and it wasn't cheap
but I always say no a full day of my
time is not worth the one monthly
payment right
I don't want to spend a whole day
just to avoid one payment of the month
I'll just do it next month and then next
month the next month so basically it's a
way to make me never do it but I was
there to play so I stayed and I worked
and I chatted and I let's see what else
did they do um
yeah
so and then there were lots of
misspellings on the chat
which made me wonder if the person even
knew how to cancel my program so now I
have to worry if they're canceling the
other services I need like my internet
and I'm thinking oh my God oh my God my
internet service is going to be canceled
but finally he said he canceled them or
she I don't know and uh maybe it
happened so all I'm saying is that if
Xfinity could partner with the Biden
Administration and simply say yeah
everybody's South of the Border you're
welcome to come in there are no
restrictions
and then just make them go through the
the Xfinity process to get into the
country
and that's it
nobody else would ever get in the
country
because the the immigrants would be like
 this
I'm going to some other I'm going to
Canada
all right
so uh Trump did a town hall on CNN last
night how many of you watched that
um
here are my big takeaways and I'm going
to get into some some details because
they're all fun
number one
you think you remembered how fun he was
you think you sort of remember it
but you're also sort of glad
that you're out of the fight for a while
you know kind of glad not to think about
him for a while because he's just takes
over your brain and sets it on fire
oh my God
I've never been more entertained by an
hour of content on a screen and I
actually mean that I don't think
those of you I was doing live screen
live stream while it happened
and if you watched I think you can
validate that I I almost hurt myself
from laughing so hard
I've never seen a performance that good
now did he pass the fact checking of
course not
of course not did I agree with
everything he said as being true and
no
no so it's not about what's true right
and I'm not going to tell you he should
be your president
because I'm a single issue voter and the
single issue is fentanyl and he never
mentioned it so if you're asking me you
know do I back him or not because of
this performance no I don't because he
didn't even mention my number one issue
but as a performance I'm going to grade
it as a performance
oh my God
there is nobody nobody in the world
that we know of
who could do what he did
I'll talk about it in in detail but it
was
amazing it was so entertaining again not
on a political scale but as a performer
it was amazing
so the first thing I'd say is age is not
showing
so his age did not show at all
um which is not to say I'm not concerned
about it I do think age is one of the
biggest issues for both Trump and Biden
but it didn't show and that's worth
mentioning you know four years from now
may be a different story but at the
moment he looked 25. in terms of his uh
mental dexterity
all right somehow we got a friendly
crowd at a CNN Town Hall
that was weird the crowd was very
approach up
and I assume that's just because the
anti-trump people just didn't want to go
maybe they couldn't get any anti-trump
people to sign up I don't know but
somehow he had the crowd on his side
and even the questions were friendly
from the crowd
um here's something that I thought was
missing from the entire evening but I
didn't watch all of the I didn't watch
all the commentary after so can you do a
fact check on me
so here's the fact Jack I need
I did not hear CNN harp on racism
yes or no
I didn't hear it was there anything
about racism
and isn't that weird
yeah it's like obviously missing because
wasn't that the number one thing
and why would it be missing did it stop
working and it makes you wonder if
that's a strategy
did any of the commentators say anything
about racism
all right I didn't see it but I would
say that's notable
and maybe it's also a compliment to CNN
you know may it maybe that shows some
interest in covering the issues instead
of just making stuff up
all right
um
it was interesting that Caitlyn Collins
was the interviewer and I'll say a few
compliments to her she was Kalyn was
very well prepared
and very professional
and uh she made the show great
the the two of them were a perfect
combination for entertainment right now
there wasn't much she could do because
because Trump totally bowled her over
and he would stop her with one hand I
was I was laughing he does the one hand
stop she starts talking and he just puts
out the hand and he just stops it with a
hand yeah and I'm talking
so she tried to ask questions
but when Trump got going he would just
go and he would just be talking on top
of her and there was nothing this CNN
could do CNN set themselves up in a way
that is hilarious that probably won't do
it again but once once the hour was
blocked off
they couldn't turn off the camera
and they couldn't stop him from talking
over Caleb because she's not she doesn't
have a big booming voice where she could
just sort of take control
but he does so he just completely owned
the stage got to say whatever he wanted
to say while she was trying to fact
check him by under talking
so he'd say stuff like and the Sun is
hot and she'd say in a lower voice
well the sun is not always hot not at
night and the clouds are in the sky well
it could be fog you know so she's just
under talking them all like fact
checking him but the undertalk fact
checking
even if it was correct I don't know how
much was correct uh didn't really have
the same weight as what he was saying so
he was just winning and winning and
winning and the fact checking was just
bouncing off
so that's fun so Caitlyn was dressed in
a a pant suit all white pantsuit which
was the perfect choice
because she'd be talking about this E.G
and Carol stuff and and you know me
tooing and that misogyny stuff
so she dressed like a a virgin man
in an all-white pant suit and I thought
that's kind of clever
she I think it would have been a mistake
for her to present herself as an
attractive woman
because she is an attractive woman so
she could have you know gone that way it
kind of sold the mini skirt or whatever
but she went with the uh most
professional you know virgin
young man look
and by the way she looked great it's not
an insult style wise style wise it was
terrific very good but it's just funny
to see how they uh they plan out the the
images
um so I thought she did as good a job as
you could do in that situation but it
was just a an awesome combination of
characters Trump and her
um some would say that uh Trump actually
grabbed her by the band suit
anybody
grabbed it by the pantsuit
no all right we'll let that go
um
of course they had to talk about E.G and
Carol and the case that she said that
that he raped her
the jury found that he didn't rape her
but that he sexually sexually battery
which is touching on unwanted touching
of a sexual nature
um
and uh of course the whole point of that
was that she was defamed
so it wasn't so much just that she was
you know victimized she would say but uh
but the issues defamed
and then CN CNN put Trump on stage to
talk about it
uh for those of you who didn't see it
let's see if you can predict what
happened
did uh Trump do any further defaming of
Eugene Carroll
was there any extra defaming that
happened
so if her intention was to stop all the
defaming
how'd that work out
oh there was a little defaming left he
did a little defaming yeah
um we all got to hear that uh E.G and
Carol's cat was named vagina
now you might say to yourself how is
that relevant to anything
it doesn't have to be it's just really
funny
it just has to be funny
so Trump did the um the Rosie O'Donnell
move
you know the first 2016 the first debate
he was accused of you know bad behavior
with women and he just sat down just
only Rosie O'Donnell and then
that became the joke you couldn't even
think about the accusation anymore
because his response to it was too funny
and here he is dealing with these
allegations and his responses
uh
you if you picked a billion people to
put on stage and have to defend
themselves against sexual battery
charges
nobody would have ever done it that well
nobody has ever defended themselves from
sexual Charges better than saying her
cat's name is vagina I'm sorry it's it's
not intuitive
but it worked and it's not an accident
if you'd never seen him do this before
you'd say well he got lucky no he didn't
get lucky this is technique he has the
technique
he also said
that he also said and this had nothing
to do with anything he just had to put
it in there because it was funny
that she had referred to her husband as
a big ape and he pointed out that the
husband was actually you know great guy
you know Trump himself likes the husband
but she called him a big ape and
here's the punchline
he's black
that's right he was actually accusing EG
laughs he accused EG and Carol of being
a racist against her own black husband
now
uh I'm not here to defend E.G and Carol
but you know how people say uh I'm not a
racist I have a black friend and that
everybody laughs and go oh yeah that's
what that's what all the races say I
have a black friend
but
I feel like if you marry a black man
that should be allowed as a defense
against racism
is anybody does anybody disagree that
marrying somebody black
should be a pretty good defense against
being a racist but it doesn't matter you
know it doesn't matter at all whether
she's a racist or not a racist I assume
not uh but but the fact that he would
bring that up at all because it's so
visual
like you like you can see him and then
he then he has to tell us the name of
her husband
which has nothing to do with anything
but his name is John Johnson
that's right so in in his effort to
describe EG and Carol and give you you
know the frame that he wants he managed
to describe her family as as a vagina
and a Johnson
that's right
yeah I don't know if there are any other
family members like children or whatever
but the only ones he mentioned was the
vagina and the Johnson
now
if there could be a better defense
against sexual battery charges I don't
know what it would be
like this is a this is a defense
that's so good it's like for the ages
I found myself laughing uncontrollably
about about the fact that EG and Carol
was taking him to court for defaming her
and then he goes I'd see you then
says she's a racist with a cat named
vagina and that's all I'll ever remember
about her
I will never remember anything else
about her except her cat's name
and she may or may not be a racist
against her own husband
[Laughter]
oh that was classic Trump all right what
else happened
he did his usual amazing communication
job so this is what gets lost with Trump
there is nobody in the world in the
political world this is my opinion
who can
describe a policy and why he wants to do
it
faster or more effective than he can
is really amazing because he talks about
a lot of different topics and each of
these topics he can introduce with a
short sentence
followed by a number of other short
sentences that fit perfectly like they
all make sense and in a very tight
little package
he's got this little persuasive
deal for you it was very fun to watch
how well he could take complicated
things and boil them down into simple
now as part of that does he oversimplify
of course to the point of being
inaccurate of course does he use
hyperbole
of course
does he pass all the fact checking
[Laughter]
not so much
but he's I think he's completely aware
when he's
giving a good argument and when he's
just bullshitting I'm pretty sure he
knows the difference but he does both of
those things so well like nobody can
 better than he can right but
also weirdly even though he's the king
of when he has an actual good
argument
he can present it in the fewest words
with the most punch of anybody you'll
ever see and he doesn't get credit for
that because they they make fun of he
talks like a sixth grader or whatever
that's the technique
so here's how he describe some other
things he described oil as liquid gold
just think about that
because he turns everything into a
visual and something you can feel
so oil is the thing you put in your car
but he turned it into liquid gold
if you knew you had Liquid Gold under
your ground you'd have to go get it but
if you knew you had some dark oily stuff
that's going to Gunk up the atmosphere
and cause you some climate change and
pollute well you don't need that so much
but Liquid Gold well I need some of that
Liquid Gold get me some of that yeah The
Beverly Hillbillies
uh
and then here when he was asked about
inflation what he would do about it he
made the story that energy prices
were driven High by Biden and you say to
yourself okay that's probably true
Biden probably did things that affected
Energy prices and they says energy
energy is in all of our other prices
because you need energy to do anything
and therefore everything went up
I thought to myself okay that is not
true
it's true-ish
I mean it has more to do with how much
money was printed right it was basically
it's a money printing problem but it's
also true that energy prices went up
and now CNN does a fact check on this
I'll talk talk about this later so CNN
doesn't buy the fact that uh what Biden
was doing was reducing the amount of oil
exploration uh well I'll skip in cfn's
fact Jack is that Biden was producing as
much uh oil as drunk
the basically Biden didn't really pull
back on anything
now that's fact Jack doesn't sound right
to me but I think it's right in some
ways so it's not as clean it's not as
clean as
Trump was pro-oil and Biden was anti-oil
because Biden's doing a lot of oil stuff
more because he has to
I think more because he has to it's not
his first choice because it doesn't go
with the climate change stuff
uh but there's maybe not that much
difference now
do you believe that
do you believe that a trump presidency
would produce as much energy from
America as a Biden
Administration
I don't right so in terms of the
persuasiveness of the argument it
totally works even if the fact-checking
you know is more nuanced
as an argument it works because he makes
it so clean and simple I would drill
more than Biden therefore we'd have more
energy and your prices go down
if the price of energy goes down all the
prices of your goods go down
boom
now that's true but it's ignoring the
whole printing money problem
[Laughter]
so it's kind of Genius because he
simplified it to the way we can all
understand it
but he simplified it to the point of
being misleading
doesn't matter
probably not
probably not
um
he said he could solve the Ukrainian war
in one day
and when asked who he wants to win the
war
he would not say Ukraine
is that good or bad
well here's how he framed it he said I
want people to stop dying but do you
want Ukraine to win or Russia I want
people to stop dying I'll settle this
thing in one day but do you want Ukraine
to win
I want people to stop dying
that was the right answer as I wrote
right the high road and he made us a
promise he could end it in one day let
me ask you this
do you think he could end it in one day
let's say one business day not not the
first day of office but do you think he
could end it in one business day
loot all the yeses
I actually think so
I actually believe it
because because all he'd have to do is
say here's the deal
you better end it now
with all the pain that both of you are
going to have to take or I'm going to
crush both of you
I'll Crush both of you I will crush you
great if you don't end it or at least
negotiate in good faith and Russia I
will crush you if you don't negotiate
this I'll Crush both of you because you
know what neither of you are America
foreign
that might end in one day
uh if the president of the United States
goes in incredibly this is this is the
important part the credible part Trump
can incredibly say I hope you understand
neither of you are of America right and
you're us
we're done with you us
we don't care what you do to each other
frankly but you're done us
I'm going to come down like a pile of
bricks on both of you it's done
figure it out
could he do it in a day
maybe
that the beauty of it is you can't
really rule that one can you
I would say I would bet against it you
know I'd bet against it being able to do
it in one day but I wouldn't bet against
him be able to do it
you know it would take longer than a day
but I actually think he could pull it
off
because he's the only one who would be
willing to say you're not America
Ukraine
just remember that you're not America
hey Putin you're not America we're not
on either of your side we're on our side
and you better cut it out because you're
too expensive I think you can do it
all right um
I had criticized him for calling Ron
DeSantis to sanctimonious but when I
heard him use it in context spoken as
opposed to on a paper because I'd only
seen it in tweets and you know written
for him and I didn't like it but when he
throws it in a sentence without stopping
he's just talking about somebody else he
goes yeah and then Rhonda to
sanctimonious to this it worked he
totally sold that thing I didn't think
he could sell that
because it just doesn't look right in
writing but when you hear him say it you
go so this is what I said in the man
cave last night
when he says Ron Des sanctimonious and
he doesn't slow down he just keeps going
on with his sentence it makes you say
wait what did he say
and you back up you you replace it with
DeSantis and they say oh where's he
going and then you have to catch up to
the rest of the sentence
nobody can make you focus better than
that
like he draws you in and then you can't
look away because even within one
sentence he is giving you an adventure
there's an adventure within the sentence
because you have to check that name in
your head roll it around and then he's
he's already talking ahead and then
you've got to catch up to him he's
making you work to be part of the
sentence it's phenomenal technique it's
phenomenal
all right
um
there are a lot of things that Trump
said that failed the fact checking we'll
talk about that in a bit but feel true
which is what he does best
now you're going to vote on how you feel
so making people feel something is the
whole trick it's not about what you
think it's how you feel
and here are some things which he makes
you feel the right thing
without the Right facts
so when he talks about the election
being rigged he does not have the facts
to back that up he says he does
but doesn't it feel like it's true
because you live in a country where I
started off saying one-third of your
scientific papers are fraudulent fifty
percent of them can't be reproduced you
know we live through Russia collusion we
live through the whole vaccination
 the pandemic we're in
a period in which all the experts have
been outed as unreliable all of them
and the claims that were made about the
election was in a different time
it was a different time
the 2000 mules has been debunked
um
and the time now is people don't don't
believe anything from Authority
they believe nothing from Authority and
that's the right take by the way that is
the correct view and so Trump is now
operating in a world in which the public
has been trained not to believe anything
so when he says the elections are rigged
there is no I'm not aware of any facts
that would back that up
and it feels true
what do you think
would you agree with that statement that
there's not a confirmed fact let's say a
confirmed fact you think there's
evidence and maybe there isn't but
there's no confirmed you know Court
approved validated fact that says that
the elections were rigged
but it sure feels like it
I I try to be as skeptical as I possibly
can about anything that important so I I
keep to keep my skepticism like you know
nailed at 100 percent
until there's something that just kicks
the out of it and I have to change
my mind
and even even I say it feels like it was
rigged I don't have any evidence of that
but it sure feels like it so his his
ability to go with what feels right over
the fact checking is
really effective You could argue it's
morality or ethical
context
all right here's some more of those he
did uh
oh so here's a clever framing on
abortion as you know the Republicans
have a huge problem
selling their views of abortion to
anybody who's on the other side because
nobody's buying that
and
Trump was asked if he would be in favor
of some federal banned ban on abortion
and his argument was that it was a great
success of his to get rid of roveries v
Wade
to which I say was it
how is that a trump success
not in the Supreme Court and any
Republican any Republican would have
picked
uh conservative judges right
so basically any Republican would have
gotten to the same place yeah he did
pick them but any Republican would have
been in the same place
that said
I would give it to him I would give it
to him as an accomplishment what would
you say
uh it just wasn't
it wasn't hard it wasn't hard but it did
happen the hard part was winning the
election
so I'll give him a hundred percent
credit for winning the election
and that allowed him to pick the judges
and I don't think another Republican
would have necessarily won
2016. so
I guess I guess we can give him credit
for that but the real credit is that he
won the election to be in that position
all right so he takes credit for that
but then he adds this Nuance that I
hadn't heard before it's really clever
he says that what he did by getting rid
of Roe v Wade taking credit for that is
he gave conservatives
listen to this framing he gave
conservatives some negotiating power
at the state level
so he's still saying the states get to
work out what they want to do
but now because Roe verse Wade doesn't
end the conversation before it starts
there's actually something to talk about
and the way he frames it is I'm not
telling you what I want the law to be
I'm saying I want everybody to be happy
I want everybody to be okay with
whatever the law is
which is really clever
that's really clever because always
before it was black and white my opinion
should be the law of the land
I've said before that the one person who
should not express an opinion on
abortion is who's the one person in the
whole country you should not have a
public opinion on abortion
well man okay that's a separate argument
the president
yeah the President should never be
either should stay out of the
conversation completely
or should be in favor of life at all in
all situations you don't want your
president ever to say well
you know life is special but I got this
special case where maybe we don't need
so much life here
you don't want a president who would
ever ever be in favor of less life
but there are there are real life
situations where people have to make
decisions
and I think that's to be driven down as
close to the individual as possible and
the state is a lot closer to the
individual than
than the federal government so I kind of
like that I'm not sure you sold that
completely but I like where that's going
and
when asked where he would want the
abortion limit to be yeah how many
months or in what conditions he said
with exceptions you know some Ray give
exceptions like uh rape and incest or
something else or the health of the
mother
and
those sound reasonable to most people
even if you disagree
you're within the reasonable zone right
the reasonable people could disagree on
rape and incest
they could disagree but you wouldn't say
the other side is crazy
that's just the disagreement right so
that's okay
you know people disagree but I love his
uh his framing that he wants a situation
that's negotiated
negotiated by the people who are closest
to the individual he doesn't say it that
way but he's inferring that and
and that he wants them to be happy
I love that I love that as a
presidential framing I want you to be
happy with the decision you're not
trying to make me happy
isn't that great
you're not trying to make me happy about
abortion I'm not having any abortions
yeah I'm he's saying I my job is to make
you happy with the result I love that
that's so good and and that it would be
negotiated and he that he's removed the
only limitation to that negotiation
happening
that is really good for Amy it's as good
as you can do
who knows if it's enough but it's as
good as you can do on that question
I haven't seen anybody do it better
um and then he talks about all those
documents
when he talks about document gate he
just throws so much into the
conversation that the viewer has no idea
if he did anything wrong or right and
you know there's this Nuance of well he
tried to you know maybe he tried to
resist giving them back but he says he
was negotiating and you know maybe it's
the same as Biden but maybe it's not the
same because Biden yeah blah blah blah
blah and then he says that all of his
documents were Declassified
and then CNN fact fact check someone
says no there was no process
by which you declassify them
is that a good fact Jack
so Trump says they were Declassified
and CNN says no there was no action
taken
so that the lack of action taken shows
they were not Declassified
so here's the argue here's the the
correct answer the correct answer is
that the law does not specify a process
and that means the process is whatever
the President says it is
and he said the process was if I take it
out of the White House it's Declassified
you're done
yeah I think the fact check is
completely wrong on this
if there's no process
the process is whatever the President
says it is and he said that was the
process
if I if I remove it it's Declassified
that should be the end of the story
of course it won't be but he did a good
job on just confusing the issue by
blaming everybody else
all right
um now he was asked about you know
January 6 he said he would have pardon
he's he's leaning toward pardoning some
substantial amount of the January 6
people but not all of them because they
might have been actually violent CNN
fact checks that by saying that there
were hundreds of violent people and they
don't they stopped short of saying that
only violent people are being held and
that's really the question isn't it so
the fact Jack looked illegitimate to me
because the correct fact check would say
well he says not the violent ones
but here's how many were violent and
here's how many were not
that would be the fact Jack
not many people were violent
that's not a fact check that's
propaganda
okay
um
but apparently uh
congressperson Byron Donalds
was on CNN and panel discussion and I
heard really good things about his
his uh I'll call it a performance as
well and I've seen a little bit of Byron
Donald's and I like him a lot he's
really good
he's a good speaker
and
um and this for what he said further uh
in between further shows me that he's
the real deal so I would keep an eye on
Byron Donald's I feel like he's a rising
star in the Republican party but here's
what he said in a tweet he said the
American people aren't speaking about
the 2020 election a liable case after 25
years or January 6.
and I thought to myself
well that's perfect
that is true those are the three least
important things we've kind of moved on
we're sort of talking about what can you
do for us in the future and we're kind
of over the election we're kind of over
EG and Carol and we're kind of over
anything in the past January 6. and I
love the fact that a representative of
the Republicans
would talk about the future
and say stop obsessing about the past
because that is a really good Republican
view for everything
that the rest of the Republican party
and Trump himself
should take a take the lead of Byron
Donald's
because by minimizing the past and
saying we've got future problems and
we've got current problems how about we
talk about those you can't get a better
High Ground than that that's the
ultimate High Ground forget about the
past let's work together in the future
so very strong very strong from Byron
Donalds
um here's CNN with its fact checks that
made me laugh the first one's a mind
reading fact check
on the question of a strict voter ID
laws and so they say
it is true that most Democrats have been
against stricter voter ID laws in the
past but on grounds that these laws
could disenfranchise voters who may not
have access to necessary identification
not in order to illegally obtain votes
so this is a CNN fact check in which
they're using as their fact their
ability to read the minds of the people
who wanted uh you know didn't want
stricter voter ID laws and they can read
the mind and they know that what's in
there okay I'm picking up now is no they
actually are honest people who just want
to what make sure that voters are not
disenfranchised yet has nothing to do
with the fact that it would almost
certainly give you more Democrat votes
that we're looking for that in their
minds nothing nothing there so they
actually did a mind reading fact Jack
how many people noticed
yeah how many of their readers read that
and said well you don't know what people
are thinking
it once you see that model that people
are migrating then you see it everywhere
but until you see it you just read that
and go oh okay
all right here's another fact check
Republicans have argued
uh
uh or the talking about the the letter
that the 50 prior Intel people signed
about the onto laptop the fact check so
Trump said that the
the lying letter that said the laptop
was Russian disinformation he said it
cost them the election that it changed
votes the CNN fact Jackson says
Republicans have argued that the letter
helped discredit negative stories about
the Biden family just before the
election but there's also no proof that
the letter swayed the outcome of the
election
there's no proof
um was there not a national poll that
said that 17 percent of people would
have voted differently
now would you call a poll
proof
no no a poll is not proof
how can you prove the past
it's an unprovable situation by its
nature
you can't prove you can't prove what
would have happened if something else
had happened in the past you can't prove
the past
you might be able to prove the future
like say if this happens you know set up
a controlled experiment or something but
you can't prove the past
that if something else had happened
something else would have happened
that's not a real thing and for them to
ignore the fact that there was a poll
that said where people actually said
they would have voted differently now I
don't believe the poll
I don't believe that poll I do not
believe 17 would have voted differently
because of that wonderful thing by then
people were pretty locked in
now if CNN had said that
that would have been a good fact check
if they said so close to the election
people don't really change their mind
I would have accepted that but to say
there's no proof and therefore it can be
dismissed Ah that's propaganda
you have to at least mention the poll
even if you're dismissing it you have to
mention it
all right
um
here's one that really surprised me by
answering the big question so Trump
tried to blame uh them house Speaker
Nancy Pelosi
for not accepting
more security during January 6. so he
says that Nancy Pelosi was in charge of
security and didn't do a good job and
that's what partly why January 6 went
bad
now they got he got fact checked because
Nancy Pelosi was in fact not in charge
did you know that
Nancy Pelosi was not in charge of
security here's who was
this is the first time I've ever heard
this
I'm sure it doesn't do so that's that's
on me but uh
the speak this is the fact Jack I'd see
them the speaker of the house is not in
charge of the Capital Security who is in
charge is the capital police board
so that's who was in charge of the
Capitol Police board
what was that
do they have a boss
isn't that the question you asked well
let me answer that the Capitol Police
board
is made up of the it's a body that
governs the United States Capitol Police
so they're in charge of the capital
police and it consists of three voting
members
the Sergeant at Arms of the United
States House of Representatives the
sergeant-at-arms of the United States
Senate and the architect of the capitol
the architect of the capitol
what the hell is that
what's the architecture of the capital
and you know the sergeant-at-arms of the
of the Senate and also the house I
assume that they're just like head of
security
basically so the head of security for
the Senate the under security for the
house and then some architect
the architect of the capitol
what
now don't you think that this
explanation that I had to Google do you
think that it shouldn't maybe explain
who the architect of the capital is does
anybody know
is that some administrative job
all right
so now Imagine This
so imagine that you need the uh you need
to quickly add some security
to the Capitol Building
you need to quickly add some security
but you can't do anything until you got
the architect of the Capitol and then
these two sergeant-at-arms together it
was a committee
that explains everything
the reason there was no quick security
during January 6 is that the who was in
charge was a committee of people that
nobody knew
it was a committee of strangers
have you ever seen an interview with any
of those three characters
as CNN ever interviewed the architect of
the capitol to ask why the architect of
the Capitol didn't agree to more
security
architect of the capital is the
facilities manager you say
now the architect is under Pelosi's
Direction
Maybe
and Pelosi is the one who nominates the
sergeant in arms for the house
so Pelosi had to sway
with those three individuals but it was
a committee that that explains
everything
doesn't it if I told you that security
did not come quickly when they should
obviously should have
and then I say oh it was a committee
decision are you done
that would explain the whole thing it
was just a committee so they had
they basically didn't have the right
management structure to get anything
done quickly
just didn't have the structure
it is however true
that if Pelosi had talked to any one of
those people and told them to do it they
would have done it
do you agree
if Pelosi had said to any one of those
three people even the Senate one which
he had no sway over
just call them up and say we need
security
 now
they're not going to say we're going to
talk about it we'll get back to you
they're going to give her her security
because they can't they can't face her
after that can they imagine having to
face her after they said no
so I think Trump was right in uh he's
emotionally right
he's not technically right then Nancy
Pelosi was in charge but doesn't he feel
right
it feels like he's right doesn't it even
though technically he wasn't
so he does a brilliant job of feeling
right when he's technically wrong
and I don't even criticize that
because the way you feel this big part
of the whole deal
all right
um
let's see uh asked about he also talks
about his perfect phone call with Brad
rafsenberger about the finding the votes
and
um here's how they fact check that
so of course he said I wasn't trying to
tell you to make up votes of course he
said
that the he thought the election was
rigged and that there would be legal
uncounted votes if he just looked for
them
now that's exactly obviously what he was
thinking obviously what he was asking
for and obviously that was the right
defense
but here's what CNN says it's a brazenly
false claim
uh they I didn't ask them to find
anything that was abrasively false claim
as CNN and other organizations obtained
recordings of the call in which Trump
repeatedly suggests that George
elections figures should be able to find
thousands of votes and fraudulent
ballots
specifically Trump said I just want to
find blah blah
now
so do you catch what's going on here so
CNN is and others have been accusing him
of of telling rafsenberger to invent or
cheat
that's been the claim all along is that
rafsenberger
was being asked to cheat
although the word was fined so Trump
made the verbal mistake of saying I
didn't ask them to find anything when he
had used the exact word find
but once once he explained the find
means to see if there are any uncounted
legal votes
that should be the end of it right
but instead once they'd been completely
debunked for what they've been saying
forever
forever CNN has been saying that he was
asking them to do something illegal as
soon as he clearly explains that no I it
was a in the context of thinking that
they hadn't counted it right
because there's there's no answer to
that once he says obviously you this
whole conversation is because you
believe that I believe it was rigged
right the whole context is CNN believes
that Trump believes correctly he
correctly they correctly believe that he
believes it was rigged
so in that context when he says find
votes it's obvious he means uncounted
legal votes it's obvious so they had to
abandon that as soon as he was there in
person to debate it
and the way they abandoned it was to
call a fact check on him saying he
didn't ask them to find anything but
they had said so many times that that he
had asked them to like invent votes I
think he thought he was denying the
invent votes
but he used the word find
so I think he just misspoke and then
they had to fact check the misspeaking
because they could no longer fact check
the central claim
that was a clever move
all right
drum claimed that the U.S has provided
171 billion to Ukraine but that the
European Union only gave 20. so they
fact checked that and they said both
assertions are false no
said no I'm sorry you think that U.S
gave 171 billion and the European Union
only 20 billion I'm sorry both claims
false here's what's true according to
CNN
uh the European Union has provided uh 37
billion
uh where's the other part
both claims are false
oh the other claim is that we don't have
enough ammunition
um so Trump says we don't have
ammunition for ourselves right now
and they fact check it because we still
have some ammunition for ourselves
do you catch that
Trump said we don't have ammunition for
ourselves and they said that's false we
have some ammunition for ourselves
but neither of them said how much
those are both the same statement
how many times have I had to teach you
that nobody ever means everybody it's
never an absolute
the country is running out of oil
no that still means we have oil left
right the population is declining
no there's still some people alive
um
there's a high crime rate in some
demographic no most of them are not
committing any crimes
it's never everybody it's never
everybody
and so when you see anybody fact check
somebody's alleged claim of an absolute
the fact Jacker is the criminal here
you don't fact check a statement that's
obviously not meant to be an absolute
but they did
and then is he so wrong
so he said the U.S put in 171 and the
the European Union only put in 20. but
they're like no that's so wrong they put
in 40.
but what about the 171
how how does that change Trump's
argument at all
you're like oh they only put in 20. well
you know if they'd put in 40 I'd be good
no it's 171 is your bogey that or that's
your target
40 is not really close to 171.
neither is 20. so again Trump is
emotionally correct you can feel it you
can feel that the U.S is putting in more
than the European Union and they fact
check it
now I like the fact Jack I should know
that it's you know closer to 40 than 20.
but it doesn't change his point
it doesn't change his point at all
um and then the running out of ammo
things just CNN uh then
uh than the border wall
this is just so Brazen Trump claimed
they had finished his promised wall on
the border with Mexico he said quote I
did finish the wall I built a wall he
said I built hundreds of miles of wall
and I finished it and then I said we
have to build some more
hahaha
what does that even mean
what does it mean to be finished if you
need to build more
for me having to build more is the
opposite of being finished
but of course you got fact check like
crazy because not much of the wall got
built
but the fact that you would just like
throw that out there it was hilarious
all right that's the case where he knew
he was he knew he was full of but
he's he's selling anyway
all right um
here's an interesting one so he was
accused of not caring enough about Mike
Pence's safety during January 6.
and Trump says to us that he doesn't
believe that uh Pence was actually quote
in any danger
during those several hours
what do you think of that response
Trump said he wasn't in any danger
in in retrospect after the fact with
what we know now is it true
he was surrounded by men with guns was
he not was he not surrounded by armed
men
in retrospect he was saved
because the the people coming after him
apparently did not have the same you
know level of weaponry
so he actually was safe because they
would have shot the first person who
came through the door just like Ashley
Babbitt
now you don't know and and if it were me
I wouldn't feel as safe I mean if I were
Pence I would definitely say I don't
feel safe but it's not a bad argument
it's not a bad argument
yeah the the guns probably would have
protected them but you don't know I mean
this is one where he's technically he's
probably technically correct
but this is one where it doesn't feel
right
you see the difference
he became CNN in this case he's giving
you a technical answer it doesn't feel
right
you know I like my vice president to be
alive
I like my vice president to be protected
and I love me some Mike Pence which I
say all the time don't agree with him
you know I don't don't agree with you
know his opinions on stuff but he is an
honorable Patriot
and I'm I'm totally in favor of it
all right
um let's see
uh
you did oh they fact checked Trump
saying that he got NATO to spend more
money
have you ever heard that fact check
before
so Trump says yeah I got NATO to put up
all this extra money
and here's the fact check
so did Obama it's been trending this way
and it's just more of the trend
have you heard that before have you ever
heard that Obama got them to spend more
money to and that this was basically a
continuation of an upward trend
how true that is
because it's a little sketchy the way
they present it it feels like they're
trying too hard on that one but but I'll
take the fact check that Obama also
increased that's probably true
it was the eighth consecutive year of
rising defense spending for the NATO
countries
all right
um
so Democrats were trying hard to defend
the Biden crime family and their defense
has approached parody
which is the fun part the part where I
get interested I like it when the
Ridiculousness Rises to you can't tell a
parody from a real thing anymore it
looks like it's all just a joke
but their defense is that oh sure there
might be plenty of evidence of a
complicated web of companies that don't
provide actual services but do take
money from uh foreign Nationals who
maybe are adversaries in some cases and
uh it does seem that they gave that
money to the Biden under Biden and some
other family members but here's the
important part
no evidence is presented that
um
no evidence was presented that any of
that money went to Biden or that any of
his policies were influenced by it
that's the defense
oh yes yes so his family
was a criminal Enterprise well that's
true yeah but there's no evidence that
that money went to him
let's see what evidence do we have
we do have evidence that Hunter
complained that he had to give a lot of
his money to his dad
I don't know I would call that evidence
it's in writing in the actual words of
the
principal person
how about the fact
that there's a documentation that Hunter
was renting a room at his parents house
for fifty thousand dollars a month
or rented the house was it the house or
a room I can't remember but when you
heard that did you think to yourself wow
that's a that's a lot of rent
seems almost higher than the market
would demand
it's almost as if it was a way to give
his father money
that was laundering it
so I'm pretty sure that there is
evidence that Joe Biden benefited
you can't say it's proof they might not
have to see it in the court of law with
all the you know counterpoints Etc but
there's evidence there's certainly
evidence now I'm thinking where does
this go next
the next place it would go is all right
all right sure we do have evidence that
the money came from adversary countries
through the hunter crime family and some
of it did end up in Joe Biden's pocket
but there's no proof he ever spent it
yeah there's no proof he spent it
and it's just going to be getting stupid
oh he took the money
yeah he took the money
but he didn't spend it or the next one
will be oh yeah
he he did take money from people trying
to influence his policy
but he was going to make that policy
anyway
I mean he was going to do that anyway it
just makes sense
yeah
well yeah things did go the way that
that company wanted them to go but you
know things were going to go that away
anyway
sort of like NATO NATO was going to give
us more or the European countries we're
going to give more money to Nato anyway
yeah it just it was going to happen
anyway
that's funny
um
let me now test the intelligence of my
audience can you give me the answer
before I ask the question go
give me the answer before I ask the
question
I won't even look
I'll look up now
good that is how smart you are
and the question was
Rasmussen did a poll on how many people
think the Biden crime family accusations
are in the serious category there are
two different categories but uh 69
percent said that the Biden family
accusations are a serious issue
but the real question I wanted to ask
you is how many polled think it's not
serious
26 percent
26. you you basically got it yeah 26
percent
and that's how smart my live stream
audience is there has never been a
smarter audience in the history of
politics and life itself they can tell
you the answer before the question is
asked if you'd like to see me do this
demonstration over and over again well
there's no limit to how many times I can
do it
all right
um
why are we okay that uh the vice
president is drunk in public
I just feel like I need to say that
every 10 minutes why are we okay with
that
why is that okay
all right I'm done with that
here's a question I asked does it strike
you as suspicious that a whole bunch of
companies that could never make a good
AI product before
suddenly they can all do it this year
does it seem weird to you
that couldn't do it at all
or not really well enough to make any
kind of commercial product out of it but
but now everybody can do it so a so
Google is now getting ready to roll out
their version they've already got this
thing called Bard but they're going to
work on the search as well
so
doesn't that seem a little bit
coincidental
now here are the theories which I got
the theories are number one they share
they share discoveries
but do you think that competitive
companies are sharing the good stuff
are they
or it could be just employees leave one
company and take their knowledge to
another could be that so probably
there's a lot of uh
one company you know paying double to
hire away a good engineer
so you'd expect that they could afford
to hire away the good Engineers so maybe
they're all just working with the same
knowledge after a while could be that
the other thing is
there was a technical breakthrough
which became common to all of them so
around 2017
there was this technical breakthrough
called
what they call it Transformers
so a Transformer is a technical word
that relates to the AI
field and what it is is well the can I
just read you the the definition because
I think the definition is really
self-explanatory I don't want to use my
words because it could be confusing so
I'll just give you the just the simple
explanation because this might be the
the key thing that unlocked Ai and made
it work for everybody
so I mean just in simple terms this is
what it is all right to solve the
problem of parallel parallelization
Transformers try to solve the problem by
using now hold on uh convolutional
neural networks together with attention
models
and then the attention uh boosts the
speed of how fast the model can
translate from one sequence to another
but the idea behind the attention
mechanism was to permit the decoder
to utilize the most relevant parts of
the input sequence in a flexible manner
by a weighted combination of all the
encoded input vectors with the most
relevant vectors being attributed to
highest weights
and that's what you thought it was right
I probably didn't add anything to what
your current knowledge because that's
that's exactly what you're thinking
you're thinking well is this some kind
of thing to does it involve weighted
combinations of all the encoded input
vectors with the most relevant vectors
being attributed to the highest weights
yes yes that's exactly what it is is
what you were thinking
so good for you
you got that one right too
uh but it could be that this now keep in
mind this was 2017.
so everybody got this new knowledge
about this Transformers kind of thing so
they got that in 2017.
and it took them all exactly this amount
of time
to produce the commercial model
there's something we don't understand
do you believe that
isn't there some there's at least one
variable
that we don't understand
because this is too much of a
coincidence
now it could be that sharing of
employees thing but you know usually
they're in some kind of a
you know non-disclosure agreement
situation but maybe that just doesn't
work in this world
I know
here's another possibility
that the AI technology came from the
government
that the government knew how to do it
and they made it available to some
select big corporations because they
want the United States to be competitive
in much of the way in much the way the
internet was boosted by our government
Because the Internet would be so
important to everything
it could be the AI is so important that
our government said uh we do have some
good secrets
and we're going to allow you to see them
now here's what I would watch for to see
if that's the case what I'd watch for is
um technical countries countries have
good technology let's say South Korea if
South Korea does not come out with its
own independent AI
real soon
what would that tell you
well it would tell me it's not because
of this Transformer stuff
because they all have access to it
um
what about China
suppose China doesn't come out with a
good AI
anytime soon
so the fact that it seems to be American
companies who all sort of suddenly could
do this you know Microsoft can do it and
uh
you know Snapchat can do it and how
Google can do it
Apple's working on aversion probably
I don't know I feel like the
government's involved what do you think
just a speculation
no
maybe DARPA I've seen DARPA being
suggested by a lot of people
I don't know I'm not confident
I'm not confident in that speculation
so if you told me the government was not
involved it wouldn't shock me but it
feels like there's a big unexplained
element and when they're a big
unexplained elements
I look in the same places
all right did you know uh relevant to
nothing do you know open AI sort of the
biggest first one has a board member
named will Hurd
yeah it was announced he recently joined
the board of directors for open AI
let's see what was his previous job
before that he was something else before
that he was something else and before
that he was a CIA
all right ladies and gentlemen
I believe this was possibly the best
live stream you've ever seen Trump is
back
and he's looking strong
um I'm still backing Rama Swami because
he's younger and tough on Fentanyl and I
do like RFK Jr though he's got some good
stuff to offer good for the country to
have that conversation it's just great
I'm loving so far this presidential
cycle
because it is introducing us to
refreshing elements and we needed to be
refreshed so that's that's good all
right uh
YouTube I hope this was your best live
stream you see today and I will talk to
you tomorrow thank
