foreign
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization the thing that makes
everything better in a hundred different
ways at least I've counted them would
you like to take it up to a new level an
amazing level a level that
I don't know I don't know if humans have
ever even experienced this but we're
going to take it up now and all you need
all you need is a copper mugger a glass
of tanker jealous it's not a canteen
trucker flaska Festival of any kind
well that's the best I've ever said that
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
it's going to happen right now
go
oh somebody's in the gym and can't sip
now
um
we're not going to wait
but it's good that you're in the gym
that's a very good thing to do
at the same time
that you are consuming coffee with Scott
Adams
well there's so much news today I can
hardly
begin
uh Greta tunberg
says that she's she thinks that Germany
should keep its nuclear power plants on
because the alternative is burning coal
um
why did it take Greta until now to say
that
and the story went on to say that she's
feeling good and you know she's in a
good place sort of mentally and
emotionally she's in a good place now
I'm really happy
that Greta destroyed planet Earth
but then she's feeling good because
that's why we do it right that's why you
destroy the planet to feel a little
better about yourself and she is and so
that's good
on one hand planet earth has been
destroyed
on the other hand Grant is feeling a
little bit better about herself and I
think that counts you've gotta you gotta
balance out the positive and the minus
honestly I wonder how she rationalizes
this
does she not look
at the at the state of the world and
know that that was her
I mean not all of it but big part how
does she not know
her culpability
in in all of this Badness I don't I
don't think that her brain can process
that right in her mind she probably blew
things forward and then other people
just do other things
all right
um I heard some people say the one way
to save the nuclear marriage is to make
it harder to get a divorce
how many how many of you think that's a
good idea
to make it like really really hard to
get a divorce
anybody think that's a good idea
that sounds like the advice you give to
people who have never been in a in a
marriage where they wanted to get a
divorce
I don't think there's anybody who ever
wanted a divorce Whoever thought that
was a good idea
so my take is that there was a time in
history when making it hard to get a
divorce probably was a good strategy
because people didn't have a lot of
options
you know you married
somebody you knew that's it well I know
somebody I know the farmer farmer's
daughter next door so
I guess I'll marry her
and I'm the only one she knows that's
the right age so I guess we're getting
married
um I think in those days when people had
very few options
maybe marriage was good to lock it
but today people are exposed to some of
the Alternatives you know they've had a
hundred lovers before they get married
sometimes all kinds of stuff
like people's brains
can be happy with one option for 60
years
I just don't think we're that kind of
people it's unrealistic in terms of who
we've become it wasn't unrealistic in
1800s in the 1800s it might have been a
survival necessity but at the moment
we've really changed in terms of what
we've been exposed to and what we care
about and you know how specific our
preferences are
so I don't know if that's the answer
I saw a tweet by uh Joshua liseck uh
yesterday that kind of stuck with me and
I saw it again today so I thought I'd
share it he was saying that uh he heard
a podcaster saying the following thing
the other day quote I can't get behind
person a because they like to tweet from
person B that tells me everything I need
to know about person a and none of it's
good
and Joshua goes on to say imagine in
bidding you think this way in public
imagine
thinking
that you know everything about somebody
based on who they tweeted
and I agree with Joshua so much on this
point because I you've seen me make a
point before that I sometimes maybe once
or twice a year
I declare in public my right to
associate with people you don't like
aggressively
I'm not just going to associate with
people you condemn
I'm going to be all over them
I'm going to slobber all over them
because you if you don't I I have
no tolerance for people telling me who I
can and cannot associate with
no tolerance there's no wiggle room
there whatsoever it's like free speech
right I mean I'll give you shouting fire
in the crowded theater but there are
some things you don't negotiate on and I
don't negotiate who I can talk to
I'm not going to negotiate that
to prove my point
to prove that I will associate with
people I don't even agree with
I retweeted Aaron rupar today
who was criticizing Sean handy
yeah I did that
I did that
I just I just retweeted Aaron rupar
because I agreed with this tweet
how do you feel about that
yeah
knowing my audience if you know who he
is uh you're saying to yourself
what could he have possibly said that
you agreed with
um apparently Hannity played a audio on
his show of Joe Biden trying to
um
talk to Hunter about his drug addiction
and
saying that he didn't uh
he didn't know what to do but he you
know he loved him Etc now if you've
heard about the video but you haven't
heard it you don't know the story
so that's the first thing you need to
know if you read that there was an audio
but you haven't heard it you really
don't understand the story
the hearing it changes everything
right when you hear the genuine
um
concern and then genuine love
and the genuine helplessness of that
call
you they humanizes both of them first of
all dehumanize
so I feel uh much closer to both Joe
Biden and to Hunter Biden
because of that call now I have you know
most of you know I have some personal
connection to the topic
of of fentanyl
um not mine but my stepson who passed
away
so
I really felt that
and I asked myself what was the point of
Hannity running that
I didn't see the whole segment but was
there any redeeming purpose of that
because what I saw was a grotesque
the violation of privacy
just grotesque
did you see something else
did you see something that was
newsworthy
because that was because just reading
about it and then listening to add a
context because remember I saw it out of
the context was there any context that
makes that okay
somebody says it's a war
sorry not good enough
all right well you got a little quiet on
that one so I'm gonna I'm gonna back uh
Aaron rupar on this against Hannity
and I don't really care what you think
about it just in case in case you
wondered
uh here's the thing
uh I blame conservatives
for the ongoing fentanyl problem
I blame conservatives here's why because
conservatives have a fantasy of what can
be done about it and I think Hannity
displayed that fantasy
I don't think Hannity would play that
unless he believed
that there was something like
having better character could have
helped Hunter
like if he tried harder or you know did
the right thing he'd be better off
I feel like you wouldn't run that video
now this is mind reading right but I
feel yeah exactly it's mind reading but
we don't have an alternate explanation
why you did it right
we're missing an alternate explanation
so we'd have to speculate but it would
be speculation
yeah I don't know this whole thing was
super creepy to me and I didn't like it
at one bit and I think that
conservatives don't understand that
addiction is not a choice
do you get that
how many of you understand that an
addiction is not a choice
I mean there's certainly a choice when
you first got into it that was a choice
but you know that once you're addicted
the choice goes away it's just a medical
problem after that
so all right
um and then also conservatives think
that building a a fence is going to stop
Fentanyl maybe five percent
all right um
so there's a there's a group of former
Trump officials are called
uh I'll name them in a second who are
proposing that the U.S declare war on
Mexican cartels
so that's the thing now
who is the first person who told you we
should declare war on the cartels
where have you heard that before
yeah
yeah that was me
do you know why these four people can
say this out loud so the poor four
people were named are Russ vote Ken
cuccinelli cash Patel and Mark payoletta
so it's a problem they're proposing it
so that they can shut down legal ports
of Entry
um and if needed and
uh basically give them a little more
leverage
now here's what I think I do
for the country
I don't know for sure but it looks like
it
can you give me a sanity check on this
because and this and what usually when
people say give me a sanity check
they don't mean it literally
this time I actually mean it literally
this is literally a sanity check
am I crazy
because it looks like this and another
story I'm going to tell later
it looks like
I've been playing the role accidentally
of the canary in the coal mine
meaning if I don't die
then somebody else can say it out loud
and I believe I said out loud we should
attack militarily the cartels in Mexico
even if it requires occupying Mexico
whatever it takes
now did you notice that I didn't get
canceled for saying that
right
not only did I not get canceled but I
didn't get as much pushback as you would
imagine I would get
did I
and and then when the news came out that
Trump had mentioned it in a private
conversation when he was president you
know he just floated the idea and
whoever whoever told the story said that
they dismissed it ah dismissed it
but I got in your head didn't it
was in your head
once you start thinking about it wild
ideas don't sound so wild anymore
everything's wild the first time you
hear it you know if it's outside the box
but I think
than my talking about it made it easier
for somebody else to talk about it am I
crazy
you tell me am I crazy or did I prove
that you could say that in public and
survive it
I don't know I mean I literally I can't
tell because I might be just imagining
any kind of connection to this
I don't know hard to know
anyway
um I think that if they get if they get
this pushed through
which you know the odds are against it
but maybe if uh there's a Republican
president someday they will be have more
success
um but I think this would set the stage
for a direct military attack on the
cartels that's not why they say they're
doing it
they're not they're not saying they're
doing it for military direct action but
that's what a war is if you declared a
war
you've effectively authorized military
action
so
um good work on that all the ones
working on that
um question
if the draft were ever reinstated in the
United States
and let's say the threat was one you
didn't think was worthy of your time
such as something like the Vietnam War
where people of good conscience could
say I don't think this isn't our
self-interest
um would you ever consider if you were
male
identifying as a woman so that you would
not have to register for the draft
would anybody consider doing that
would you consider identifying as a
woman so you don't get drafted
oh I would
do that in a heartbeat
of course I would
I wouldn't hesitate for a second
why
Embrace and amplify my friends Embrace
and amplify
those are the rules
I did not make up the rules
moreover if you're applying for a
college scholarship or let's say a job
at a corporation why would you identify
as white
or a white male why would you do that
I suppose you might try a few times as a
white male and see how it goes you know
maybe if you get your job you're fine
you might have a special talent or
something
but if you were competing with the rest
of the world why would you identify as
white if you don't have to
the rules are very clear you can
identify whatever you want so why would
you identify the one that gives you
fewer rights as an American citizen
effectively it'd be crazy
you know a lot of people think that I
joke
when I say I identify as black for the
benefits
that's not a joke
I identify as black for the benefits
and should people think I'm white and
give me some identified some benefits
for looking white I will take those
benefits thank you
so I can get benefits both ways why
would you do it the other way why would
you identify in the way that gets you
the least stuff
I don't make the rules I just play them
right if it were illegal to identify as
some other thing than how I feel
and I wouldn't do it
I'm big on following the law but if the
law encourages me to identify in the way
that makes my life the most
fulfilled and meaningful
then I'm going to do it anytime I want
for any reason whatsoever as long as
there's a benefit
so that's my take
so Tulsi gabbard has now she's leaving
the Democrat Party
and here's what she says in her
statement I can no longer remain in
today's Democratic party that is now
under the complete control of an elitist
cabal of War mongers driven by cowardly
wokeness gets better
here's the money shot
who divide Us by racializing every issue
and Stoke anti-white racism
actively worked undermine our god-given
freedoms and then she goes on
Tulsi gabbard actually said in public
out loud
full-throated
that she's leaving the Democrat Party
because they're anti-white racists
got to stand up for that
ah
[Applause]
standing ovation
all right
foreign
did I make it safer for her to say that
because have you been watching me for
the last month
I I feel like I Canary that coal mine
did I not
I feel like this is the second coal mine
I get married and I can't tell if
there's any connection
it feels like there's a connection
doesn't it but it could be just be the
Zeitgeist okay it could you know what
the Zeitgeist is
the Zeitgeist is this sort of
non-scientific idea
that people suddenly reach the same
conclusions at about the same time in
different places for their own reasons
but there's something about society that
made us all decide at the same time
so I guess in some sense there's a
scientific hypothesis at least
and it could be that it could be just
everybody everybody reached the same
point at the same time
but I think it helps to see somebody
not get killed for saying it out loud
and
I hope that I I hope I was useful but
it's not something I claim credit
for
who's texting me
oh good
all right uh
so that's really interesting
now I think nobody's surprised
that Tulsi had some problems with the
Democrats
but the fact that she left them stating
anti-white racism as one of the key
reasons
that is one of the gussiest things ever
I've ever seen
have you ever seen anything that gutsy
like what was the last thing you saw
that was that brave
I actually can't think of anything right
now
well yeah Trump maybe Kanye maybe yeah
okay Kanye
but but you know here's the difference
Kanye is an Entertainer and provoking is
his job
he provokes for a living
where politicians are typically not that
kind of thing yeah okay yeah maybe uh
magaze so there are a few people that
have bucked the system
um
I wonder if
if Kanye made a difference
to uh Tulsi being able to say that out
loud and full-throated way I mean
wearing his white lives matter I think I
think maybe all of this is in the mix
um here is the least surprising story of
all time what would be the least
surprising thing you could ever hear in
the news
shift lied
Adam Schiff
lied
or specifically he's being accused of
doctoring evidence of an email on
January 6. apparently Chef actually
attributed a lawyer's men uh a lawyer's
email to
Jordan representative Jordan
now if you see an email that comes from
a lawyer
clearly it's it's a whole different
frame of reference than a politician so
imagine how damning that would be
to imagine that the politician said
what the lawyer said in confidence
and that is messed up
you don't even need to know the details
do you that is messed up and he also
changed some of the words apparently so
I think the the email was changed and
then the author of the email was changed
and he presented this to the American
public as part of the January 6th thing
now
do you think there'll be any
penalty for that
because I think not
because he's been getting away with it
for now years right he literally can
just make stuff up present it to the
public and there's no blowback at all it
doesn't cost them anything
it's amazing you know and uh Mark Levin
and people are saying he should be
disbarred
disbarred you should be impeached you
can impeach
House of Representatives right
right
can somebody give me a fact check on
that
I hope seeing a no Andy yes
no but similar there's some kind of
sanctioning centered thing
you can be censored
censor yes since you're not censored
yeah okay
well
Republicans are going to have no time to
govern if they become they get power
they're just going to be having hearings
about all these Democrats
Rasmussen did a poll to see how much
people trusted electronic voting
machines
what do you think before I tell you the
answer
do you think that an electronic voting
machine is more or less secure than uh
manual paper ballots
is a voting machine more or less secure
more or less
say less less
depends less
less so many of you do distrust voting
machines yeah
I I think it's
I think it's six of one and a half a
dozen of the other and here's why
I think your odds of getting caught if
you tried something with electronic
machines might be a little higher under
some circumstances it would depend who
did it right if it were some Insider and
maybe that's hard to catch so that would
be the biggest risk uh but maybe if some
hacker got in the Insiders would catch
it so I don't know uh I don't think we
know but I can see why you you could go
either way but here's what the Erasmus
and results were uh 39 of likely us
voters think electronic voting machines
make it easier to cheat
39 it says basically all the Republicans
so Republicans I think don't like
electronic voting machines uh I forgot
to look at the crosstab so I'm just
making that up
I I don't believe it's just Republicans
but probably primarily that's my guess
all right Florida is now not
recommending vaccines for males 18 to
39.
I I thought we've known that for a while
haven't we
I've only known that for a while
and uh would you be surprised that a new
study is or some new information has
come out now
I have to warn you in advance I'm going
to get really mad at some of you
okay not all of you
but I'm going to get mad at some of you
because this is going to trigger you
into mind reading and accusing me of
 I didn't do
so when you mind read me and accuse me
of some I didn't do I'm going to go
off on you are you ready because I know
you will right because there's somebody
in this group who's going to mind read
and then falsely accuse me of something
are you ready
so let's just do this because I'm
feeling
I'm feeling a little aggressive today so
let's just fight this out
um
so apparently a Pfizer director has now
admitted in public
uh that they did not test the Pfizer
vaccination
for stopping the spread
wait what
let me say it again because you probably
thought you heard it wrong
Pfizer's vaccination which was designed
and marketed to stop the spread of covet
according to a Pfizer director
they did not test whether it works to
stop the spread
does it feel like you're hearing me
wrong or something
all right
so they actually said that
do you believe that
do you believe that they did not test
to see if a vaccination acts like a
vaccination
do you think that they did test the
primary purpose of it
well
um Owen Gregorian on Twitter saw that
tweet and he tweets us even This Is A
Lie nobody develops a vaccine and does
not test whether it stops transmission
that is correct
that is correct nobody develops a
vaccine
and doesn't test to see if it stops
transmission
You can conclude from this not not with
100 certainty
but anybody with business experience all
right all all of you who do not have big
big business experience stay quiet for a
moment okay
so just for a moment I'm going to ask
you only the people who have big
business experience tell me what
happened
they did test to see if it spreads the
initial information showed it didn't
work
so they stopped looking at it
tell me I'm wrong
they of course tested it the initial
information said it didn't work and now
they're saying they never looked
you know that's what happened
am I right and again everybody with big
company experience do you think they
didn't test
you think they didn't run any tests
yeah so I feel bad because uh Owen
Gregorian
basically told me what I should have
seen immediately which is of course they
tested of course they did
now it's possible that this one director
is just wrong or lying or bespoke or
something that's possible too
but oh my God I mean if this if this
were true which seems highly unlikely
well either way somebody needs to go to
jail don't you think
based on what we've seen so far
now you know of course everybody's
innocent until proven guilty so I'm not
I'm not accusing any specific person but
what we've seen based on this
strongly suggest somebody needs to be in
jail for a long time
that won't happen
I saw a tweet by David maritasco talking
about lithium and Ukraine and Russia
and David says that lithium oxide
deposits in Ukraine are more important
to Russia than some people understand
because remember the mystery about
lithium
is that it's everywhere and also rare
that's why we're all confused about it
because those two things are both true
it's everywhere like there are tons of
countries have plenty of lithium
and it's rare
now we know it's rare because the price
of lithium has gone up on 10 times or
something
so the price is very clear
that is rare
so how could it be everywhere and still
be rare and the answer is it's hard to
mine apparently and I don't know the
details but between the environmental
catastrophe it causes and you know the
how hard it would be to get it approved
and maybe even where it is stuff like
that so it must be just really hard to
do
so that's why there's a shortage but as
David martasco points out
um and I didn't know this this is good
information Chinese companies have
applied this year for exploring and
mining permits especially in dunesque
and Putin this is Again David saying
Putin knows uh that if he doesn't get
them meaning the uh the rights to the
lithium mining if if Putin knows that he
doesn't get them China will
so no I don't think lithium is the whole
reason for
the Ukraine problem because you've got
the you know the Empire Building the
history the you know the all kinds of
reasons
[Music]
um
but I think lithium is one of them
I think it's one of them
um
so Europe is doomed
according to Europe
uh
so there's a speech by uh
European Union top Diplomat this guy
Joseph Borelli
and he was talking about Europe and he
said this
uh
that there's the Europe's security was
provided by the United States and their
prosperity was provided by Cheap Russian
energy and Chinese Goods
and that that world doesn't exist
anymore
so that the world that made Europe
successful doesn't exist anymore
because they don't have the U.S to keep
them safe and they don't have Russian
energy and they don't have cheap uh
Chinese Goods perhaps in the future
that's a pretty bold and dangerous but
maybe true
statement
I've never yeah just the the way he
framed that is just wow
so you know I told you I'm writing a
book on reframes I had to take something
that is a familiar situation and just
sort of twist it so you can deal with it
better
this was kind of a shockingly and it's
like a slap in the face isn't it like I
read this and I was like oh
maybe I have to worry about everything
over there
like they could be in serious trouble I
don't think so I think that they will
adjust you know the the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters suggests they'll
find ways to protect themselves and be
prosperous but they might have a little
might take a little time
um
so
Adam Schiff was also
getting on in other news he was saying
the Saudi Arabia is being bad by
you know not giving us more oil
and that we we shouldn't depend on Saudi
Arabia in the long term for oil
because you know that's a sketchy thing
now
let me ask you this
you remember the khashoggi thing right
so Saudi Arabia obviously murders
khashoggi a Critic
and then and then cut him up with a bone
saw
and carried him on bags and then denied
they did it
and what does President Trump do
he he acts like he's taking their word
for it
and I say acts like because obviously he
knew what happened
so Trump goes easy on Saudi Arabia and
then what happened to Trump for going
easy on Saudi Arabia
he got just killed for that
he just ate for months and months
the critics were just jamming pulls up
his butt and slapping him in the head
and
he really took some abuse do you know
why he did that
why did he take all that abuse and be
contrarian to most of the rest of the
world
because he wanted Saudi Arabia to owe
him a favor
you soon after that
Accords which required Saudi agreement
now imagine if Trump were in power
Saudi Arabia still owes them that favor
because that one doesn't go away that
favor does not go away because all it
would take is Trump to say you know
maybe he did Kill just joking
it would take one truth message from
from Trump saying you know as I think
about it maybe they did Kill khashoggi
right I mean they still owe Trump for
protecting Saudi Arabia the Crown Prince
specifically
uh I think if Trump had been president
he would have gotten a different
response when asking the Saudis to pump
more oil what do you think
what do you think
yeah I could show you as a mother you
know he wasn't necessarily a good guy
so I'm not saying that Saudi Arabia
didn't have a reason I'm just saying you
shouldn't cut people up with bone saws
all right
I think it was 100 Biden's fault that
Saudi Arabia said no because I think
Trump would have gotten a yes we don't
know
there's no way to know but the situation
is strongly suggestive that Trump would
have gotten a yes
I don't know
all right ladies and gentlemen I feel
like I
forgot something important anything else
happening today
oh uh yes
what did I why did I skip this for some
reason so there's a new study out that
supports
um
Florida's recommendation to not
vaccinate young men
and the new report
suggests that uh it's it's dangerous
for young men to take the vaccination
how long did it take people to rip up
the new study
about 10 seconds
do you do you all believe the new study
because it agrees with what you already
believed about myocarditis
of course you do did you know did you
notice the study doesn't have a name on
it laughs
I'm watching the internet and like
people absolutely bought this study
absolutely bought into it and then
somebody else in the comments says it
doesn't even have a name on it
it's not only not peer-reviewed but the
person who wrote it doesn't even want
you to know who it is
and apparently this sample group was
small and there were other problems so
um
yeah I so I I think we're reached we've
reached a point where we can say with
complete confidence there's no such
thing as a scientific study on covid
that we can believe
how many would agree with that statement
there's no such thing as a study and
here's here's going to be the I'm not
against science because remember science
is not about one study
so there's nothing I'm saying against
science
I'm saying that science requires lots of
studies
because it's the loss of studies that
get some study to check the bad work of
the other study and then they fight it
out over time you you get close to the
truth but as soon as you say a study
helped to me well you're not you're not
in science
science would say don't believe one
study
so I I'm pro-science by saying don't
believe that study
everybody agree with that
so if I say don't believe the study that
says that the vaccination is dangerous
don't believe it that's consistent with
with science
and it doesn't matter what the study
said could have said it was good for you
could have said it was bad for you it
could have been a good study it could
have been a bad study in all of those
cases
you should not believe it
because that's not how science works
science doesn't work by believing
studies
it's the opposite of that actually it
would be closer to say science is about
doubting all of your studies how about
that
that kind of works for me when you say a
good quick definition of science is
doubting all of your information
doubting all your studies all the time
because it's the doubting that allows
you to crawl forward it's not the
believing
yeah so it's the doubting that's the
active part of science not the believing
part
but I I think that's a good way to say
it
all right ladies and gentlemen
do you feel something's changing
do you feel like there's just something
biggish
changing in the world and you can't
quite put your finger on it
it's what it feels like to me
yeah I feel like until the pandemic
every year was sort of a reasonable
projection from the year before
you know what I mean
like you know it wasn't 1996 pretty
close to 1995.
they didn't seem that different to me if
you're around that
but
uh but this year doesn't feel like
anything
there's nothing about this year
that I can identify with any prior
experience and I've been around a while
right
um and remember when
um as a true Trump is back on Twitter
are you seeing a rumor about that
there's no if Trump were back on Twitter
my entire feed would be lighting up
right now so I'm gonna say that's not
true
because there's no way that only one
person would be asking about it so I'm
guessing that's not true
but I imagine you would be I imagine you
would be if in the moment that uh
the sale is completed if it is
other fake Trump accounts or probably
fake accounts
uh I see repeated comments that
cernovich retweeted DeSantis ad that
switched you from Trump to DeSantis
yeah
yeah you know I don't think it matters
that X number of Voters would prefer
DeSantis over Trump
how will that ever matter the only thing
that matters is whether Trump is running
if he runs
he'll get nominated
all right
um so what feels different is that this
is the first time we all understand we
can't believe our experts and our
science
I believe that we used to walk around in
a zombie-like fog of hypnosis in which
we thought that when the experts told us
something it was probably true
and when the government told us
something it was probably true I mean
sometimes not but probably true and when
the science said here's our new study we
would say to ourselves well it could be
wrong
could be but probably true
now what do you say
probably not true
if I see a scientific study I say
probably not true at least two-thirds
not true
I don't know if that's actually a good
number it just feels like that and if I
see the government say anything
I say not true
it doesn't matter which side doesn't
matter if it's democrat or republican I
just automatically say oh you're leaving
out of context it's not true
so what do you do in a world where you
don't believe anything
yet you have to rely on your systems
you have to hope that your systems get
you through because our brains are not
capable of navigating our current
situation but our systems might so one
of the systems is the election system
and I'm going to make this point again
because this is such a good build up to
it
the point of an election is not to pick
the best person
that is an illusion
the point of the election is to be able
to move forward
that's the point especially when you
have elections that end up being close
you know if somebody's winning you know
52 to 48
that means the public didn't really know
who was going to do the best job
that's that's a jump ball and that's
what most of our elections are it's the
public not really knowing who would do
the best job they might have some
preferences of some policies but they
don't know who's going to pull it off
overall the best job they don't know but
we do know we need to move on we can't
have a dictator so we need to get a new
president our system
compensates for a complete inability to
reason
and that's what a good system does
total inability to reason
Tulsi is setting up to be Trump's VP
that's what it looked like didn't it it
looked like that didn't it
how much would Trump love
Tulsi gabbard as a VP
I think he'd love it wouldn't he
because both of them would have been
Democrats who became Republicans boom
uh but Trump always says and you know
this is one of the things I always
appreciated about Trump's honesty even
when he says things that make you cringe
if they're honest you're still like okay
at least it was honest and one of the
things he made he always says that makes
most of us cringe
but is honest is that looks better
and I know that he would say something
about
Tulsi being attractive
because it matters it does matter he
likes to have the Central Casting kind
of thing it's kind of perfect
have you tried the Gary Payton strain of
weed I haven't but it sounds good
um she didn't say a part of the
affiliation that's right so there's no
indication that Tulsi would be a
Republican but there's also no no
indication that she's rejecting it one
assumes that she's independent
but would there be any any reason
um an independent couldn't be his VP
choice
I imagine I would be a problem but not
not legally it wouldn't be a legal
problem
her Progressive gun grab rules are out
for Republican ticket no
no
not as vice president
see that that's the magic of Vice
President the vice president doesn't
have to have the same policies exactly
as the president
As Long As Trump is has a policy you're
okay with it'll be like be like Pence
Pence had some opinions that did not
agree with Trump
but as vice president he was a great
vice president in my opinion
I I think Pence will never get the
credit he deserves for being a great
vice president I just don't want him to
be president
yeah one of the great ones and he was
great because of the problems he didn't
make
like his uh his unforced errors were
close to zero I mean I don't know how
you do that for four years when
everybody's watching
yeah the VPS can become president
but I think that uh she would know that
to get continued support from her own
base she'd have to be compatible with
the base
or convince you to change your mind I
doubt that's going to happen
yeah yeah it's not a big problem if
they're not exactly policy aligned
they could be 90 and that's good enough
DeSantis is a better choice DeSantis is
not a better choice for a VP
how many think DeSantis is a good choice
for a VP to me that's the worst idea
yeah you never you never pick a VP that
the public will say you know
I'm just saying
if you reversed that party
um
if you put the sentence at the top you
don't want to have that conversation
even once
but
imagine
a Tulsi gabbard being a vice president
for Trump hypothetically
what do you say to yourself
automatically
I think Tulsi should be the actual
president candidate probably not
probably not
somewhat some would but it wouldn't be a
big conversation would it
I don't think it would be a big
conversation
that would be you know something you'd
yak about
all right
I think that's a good situation
that's a good situation
if Tulsi is VP what happens next time
well VPS don't usually become president
do they
uh isn't it
um how often does a VP become a
president one and four
one four maybe
what's the ratio
of Vice Presidents becoming presidents
yeah so there's Bush Senior
uh
uh what was the one before Bush Senior
four that's a special case
well Biden's I don't know
combine's a special case too Johnson
Johnson's special case
okay yeah so it seems like it's more of
a special case situation where something
happens to the president
yeah I I don't think you want somebody
as strong as DeSantis in the VP spot
you do not
now if you had suppose you had to census
as chief of staff
how about that
what if DeSantis were chief of staff
that I don't think he would take that
job
but that would be kind of amazing but I
can't see him taking that job he's more
of a leader than a chief of staff guy I
think he needs to be a leader
he'd be a strong strong package
well Trump can't share the Limelight
that's why a chief of staff would be
potentially a good way because because
the chief of staff doesn't get that much
attention
all right
um
chief of staff is a leader a leader
behind the scenes but not a leader that
the public recognizes uh unless they
really pay attention
all right that's all for now
YouTube I'll talk to you later bye
