good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization and coffee
with Scott Adams and I promise you
this will be the most awesome live
stream you've ever seen
today I have something well you've heard
of it it's called content
the good kind because the news has
served up
a bounty that
we must thank the creator of the
universe for it's never been better than
today
we got good stuff today
um but before we get to that
would you like to take it up to another
dimension a dimension that you didn't
even know existed yes you do and all you
need for that is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker Chelsea Steiner canteen
jugular flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine him the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens to outcome
I have a question the question is is
slurping allowed yes if you're alone
if you're alone if you're alone give it
a good slurp and don't apologize
if you're with people well think of your
larger relationships
question number one
I've solved one of the greatest
mysteries in human civilization
you ready
have you noticed that everybody is
anxious and has anxiety
you'll notice that right and that that's
different than it used to be
when I was a kid I don't think anybody
had that I mean I never literally never
even heard of it I know I didn't have it
nobody I know had it but now everybody
has it
now you say to yourself what is it is it
Modern Life is it social media is it
something about being attached to your
phones exactly what is it
well today I'm going to tell you the
answer and then tell you how to fix it
that's right I'll get affects the
biggest problem in Civilization which is
everybody feels bad
right everybody feels bad you get you're
overweight you're healthy but mostly
you're getting anxious about everything
I'm gonna fix it now for you you ready
we'll uh we'll work our way into it
did you know there's a thing called uh
screen apnea
tell me in the comments have you ever
heard of that screen apnea
now that means that when you look at a
screen doesn't matter what kind
could be your phone could be what you're
looking at right now
we have a tendency to not breathe
it's not the blue light
it's because you don't breathe
if you exercise you breathe
if you walk around you breathe
right
but apparently it's a real thing and I
noticed this on myself
I noticed that when I look at screens I
don't breathe
now I thought it was more about
concentrating I thought that if I were
concentrating on something I didn't
breathe I knew that
I didn't realize it was every time I
looked at a screen
and so yesterday I said to myself
could this be a thing
and I'll I'm going to tie it together
with something else in a minute I said
to myself is this I wonder if I googled
this
if I Googled do you breathe the same
when you watch a scream
so I Googled some some kind of phrase
like do you breathe differently when
looking at a screen
and what pops up
it turns out that there's a thing called
screen apnea is well understood it
definitely exists and you don't breathe
right when you look at your screens
now let's tie this too
my ongoing saga of my blood pressure
meds
which I suspect
maybe another one of these you know
coveted vaccination situations where
perhaps the benefits of blood pressure
meds have been oversold
so I don't know that for sure I know
that the the one one of several types I
took was bad for me because I had
terrible side effects so I only know
from personal experience you know one
drug
one drug and one experience
so I can't say for sure that nobody
should take blood pressure meds I
imagine there are cases where it will
save your life
but I do wonder if maybe it's over
subscribed or prescribed
and then I noticed this pattern
so here are the things that are good for
lowering your blood pressure see if you
find the pattern
exercise moderate exercise especially
going for a walk
right so that that definitely lowers
your blood pressure temporarily and also
in the long run if you do it regularly
meditation
meditation yoga
breathing exercises like the huberman
method or the Wim Hof so they're two
different breathing exercises
and being active in general
just sort of being active in general you
know doing your housework you know
making sure you're up and walking and it
turns out that walking
is one of the most highly correlated
things with longevity did you know that
Mobility people who walk who can walk
every day tend to live a long time
um now what do all those things have in
common yes you already have the answer
breathing
a hundred percent of the things that fix
your breathing
fix your blood pressure
all of them it doesn't matter which one
you do
they all work
every one of them if it fixes
your breathing
it fixes you
are you blown away yet
and now you've you've heard something
about the blue light that comes from the
devices that's probably also a problem
that's probably also a problem
but
apparently the devices make you breathe
wrong
breathing wrong affects your blood
pressure breathing wrong affects your
anxiety breathing wrong affects probably
your weight
I don't know that one for sure but I'm
guessing
now I
um I looked into the huberman method
can somebody give me a fact check as I
describe this I need a I need a
real-time fact check because I'm doing
this for a memory
I think the the huberman method which
apparently he was part of it studying
uh the benefits of breathing differently
I guess for some Stanford study so this
is based on science
and I think he described it as two
inhales through the nose
followed by one exhale to get rid of all
your your air right two inhales through
the nose
and one exhale through the mouth and
that's all it is right so it's literally
just this
now of course the first time I heard it
I tried it
right it's so easy to try why wouldn't
you try it you immediately feel better
like immediately I mean as soon as the
second exhale is done
your body feels better you should try it
now is it if it were the kind of thing
where you know if you did it every day
for 10 minutes your blood pressure might
go down a point or something like that
I wouldn't recommend it you know
necessarily
but you feel it immediately
just immediately
right
so
here's what I think
I think that devices have affect our
breathing
and your breathing is the reason you
have all the other problems
have I solved the biggest problem in
Civilization that we're all anxious and
we need meds
oh I'm not done yet
I'm not done solving your problems today
is going to be a tour de force of
solving all your problems
I'm just beginning
so here's what you need to do
I am going to hypnotize you right now
uh but before I do before you turn me
off
I'm going to hypnotize you that whenever
you pick up your phone no matter what
you're doing with it
this is your trigger now it's called a
trigger or a key in hypnosis I'm going
to key your phone to
breathing exercises
every time you use your phone no matter
what it is
to inhales one exhale and then use your
phone got it every time every time every
time you touch the phone
no no exceptions every time touch the
phone Breathe Right
touch the phone breathe right now if you
get it right with your phone
I'm confident that that's you know going
to be a big part of your problem but you
know maybe you can extend that to your
other devices it's going to be harder
because when you sit down with your
other devices you might be there for an
hour
so over the course of the hour you're
going to forget to Breathe Right
but during that hour are you going to
check your phone
probably
you shouldn't but maybe maybe you will
so you pick up your phone
Breathe Right phone Breathe Right
phone Breathe Right you've just been
hypnotized
did he like it that was hypnosis
I told you what I was going to do and
then I did it there were no tricks all I
did was pair two thoughts and now
they're paired
the first time you think of it on your
own you're locked in
right if you never think of it again you
won't lock in of course obviously if you
think of it once you're probably going
to lock in
just once
now do any of you have any depression
problems or people in your life who have
depression problems I'm talking about
serious depression now
who uh if they were better especially
you your life would be better too
Well turns out that there's a new study
a pretty big study so more dependable
than most you know very serious study
that they synthesize
synthesized magic mushrooms and took
some of the good stuff out
put it in a shot and gave it to people
who were severely depressed and what
happened
and just about all of them were
immediately cured
quote an immediate fast rapid acted
sustained
it lasts it lasts long after the effects
wear off it lasts for months
they say it wears out starts to wear off
after three months
three months
now do you see the the trick that's
happening here
let me explain it to you
for how long have you known that if you
take the actual mushroom itself
people have been telling you forever
it'll take care of your a lot of your
mental problems like depression you've
been hearing that for a long time
haven't you right
now somebody found out a way to
synthesize it synthesize it
huh you know you would synthesize it if
you're trying to take something that is
practically free and grows out of the
ground and you try to turn it into a
multi-billion dollar Pharma industry
what would you need to do
well if it were me I would synthesize it
so I could put it in a pill
or a vaccination that you can't give
yourself so easily
so you're seeing you're seeing a natural
thing being morphed into a big form of
product clearly that's what's going on
so that they can tell you that if you
eat those damn mushrooms you picked out
of the ground you're gonna die
but they've got the quality control and
they've got the extra ingredients The X
Factor the things that you could never
never do on your own
and you'd better pay hundreds of dollars
per year every three months you need a
shot
and then you'll be all good
you see there where this is going right
there's no doubt about it until big
Pharma
could make money on it you were not
going to see a study that's a high
quality study
now you will
well so that's the good news and the bad
news the bad news is a big Pharma will
try to control it the good news is it
works so whether you get your own
mushrooms or you use theirs
I think we've got a cure for anxiety a
cure from a cure for depression
and I think they're both highly likely
to work
for most people highly likely to work
all right so there's your good news
um
anybody disagree
these are massive
now I don't know if this is the Golden
Age
but if I were entering the Golden Age
the things I would look for are
everybody agrees that nuclear energy is
good finally we're pretty much all there
um Everybody agrees that we can you know
if we breathe better and work on our
health and use magic mushrooms if you
need them that you can take care of a
lot of your problems
right
um
yeah there's still the issue of who's
getting vaccinated that's a problem all
right we'll work on that later
um
uh what has surprise you to know that
the New York Post is reporting there was
a study
about who who faces more scrutiny in the
mainstream media Republicans Or
democrats who do you think gets the most
negative press
Republicans Or democrats
you already know the answer
do I even need to tell you the results
of it
you know LOL
yeah it's exactly what you think
it's exactly what you think
two inhales
everybody
I might make you do this every day
I might make you do it every day
so yeah more more scrutiny something
like GOP got 87 percent of the time
negative coverage compared to 67 percent
of the time for uh GOP and that's
looking at the ABC CBS and NBC
now some would argue that Fox News has a
bigger audience than all of those so
probably this study is complete garbage
actually if I'd read it more clearly
before I came live I would have said oh
they're looking at ABC CBS and NBC
I think if you throw Fox News in there
and then you weight it by the size of
Fox News which is bigger than all three
of them put together
well I think you get a different result
so let's call this fake news
um Jake Tapper is looks like after the
midterms he'll be moved back from his
evening program
to his afternoon program where he had
originally been
now the reporting is that that the new
head of CNN who wants CNN to be more of
a mainstream news and not a wildly
leftist news
um you wanted Jake Tapper to be the face
of CNN
so he put him in the the prime time slot
that Chris Cuomo had left
but I guess that didn't work out you got
you got shellacked by the other uh the
other networks
and they're going to move them back now
here's what is interesting about this
story
um
number one was that the right choice
was that the right choice
to put Jake Tapper as the face of CNN if
you wanted to present yourself as more
mainstream
does he fit that
the the more mainstream
I'm gonna say yes I'm going to disagree
with you I could say yes
uh you know that Tapper is the only
person on CNN that I know of that I know
of
whoever added any Nuance to the uh the
Charlottesville story
he's the only one who's had and you know
the president
you know
clarified that he wasn't talking about
the people marching
he's the only one nobody else ever did
that
all right now I'm going to tell you some
stuff from behind the behind the screen
all right and I think I can say this I
feel like this is fair even though it's
based on a private conversation I think
it's fair because it's public interest
you know he's a public figure so I you
know I know Jake Tapper we've we uh I
had him do some guest cartoons for
Dilbert a couple of different years for
charity
and so we've talked a little bit and
I've talked about I've talked to him
directly about the fine people hoax now
I talked to him before that one time he
added some Nuance I don't think I've
ever seen it again because it probably
didn't work out
I don't know
but
here's what I'm going to add first of
all give me a fact check Jake Dapper
identifies as Jewish right yes or no
I want to make sure I'm right about that
yes right yes okay now remember I said
about EA
that if yea has had a life experience
where the people who keep thwarting him
are coincidentally Jewish
and it just keeps happening over and
over again if he says something racist
I'm going to say okay I don't like that
you know I disavow it but I understand
it
right like that would just be being
human
if if some albonian punched you in the
face every time you went outdoors and
then you said I hate albonians I hate
all albumians I wouldn't say
cut that out you racist
I would say I think I'd feel exactly the
same way if I got punched by an elbonian
every time I walked out the door I'm
pretty sure I'd feel the same way and I
told you the story about somebody I went
to college with
a long history of being beaten up and
bullied and robbed almost every day by
black kids you know roughly his age
because he was in a neighborhood where
that was a routine
now he was a flat out racist
and I said to myself okay I disavowed
that well like I don't I don't join your
thinking but I'm okay with it
I was okay with them so he was a racist
I could easily hang around with and be
friends with why because he he came by
the honest way
he came by at the honest way he was
abused by one group of people every
 day
if that happens to me I'm gonna be I'll
be as racist as I need to be I mean I'm
going to do whatever feels right for me
and I don't care about that other group
if they beat me up every day and I'm not
going to be all nuanced about it all
right
how much Nuance am I going to put on
that none I might intellectually realize
that this was a special case and does
not cannot be generalized to the rest of
the group
but that
right if anybody in that group beat me
up every day for a year that you're
not going to get any Nuance out of me
I don't care how reasonable it is it's
not going to happen all right
two sniffs and an exhale
oh that felt good
all right so here's what I say about
Jake Tapper or anybody who identifies as
Jewish and looked at the Charlottesville
event
if you identify as Jewish and you say to
yourself I don't care if the president
explained away his comments
I just don't care
because the whole thing is just so bad
that I don't want to hear I don't want
to hear my president softening anything
about anybody who attended even if it's
true
I'm just not open to it
so in my mind
you know somebody like Jake Tapper
he's got a right to have a let's say an
interpretation of Charlottesville that
differs from mine
and I think I'm okay with that
I think I'm okay with that now it's
different if he reports it based on his
bias but I don't think I've seen that I
saw the opposite I saw the one guy well
I don't know one guy I saw one guy who
is Jewish
on CNN
was the only one who ever offered any
Nuance to that story and noted that the
president had a clarification that he
gave right away
so I think he actually was a good choice
like from the perspective of management
of CNN I think he actually was a good
choice I would say he was closer to
being
the middle than the other characters who
had big names there
now I've also teased CNN have you ever
heard me say this that everybody at CNN
is a version of Jake Tapper
do you remember me saying that I was
contrasting it to Fox News Fox News in
my opinion
uh the management and the
um the producers
from the executives to the producers a
whole other level of talent in my
opinion I just like the Fox News
executive people are just more talented
and what they do is they pick
um on-air Talent
that have personalities they're just not
like other people
it is is Dana Bash just female Jake
Tapper
sort of
sort of right you know Don Lemon was
sort of a gay black Jake Tapper that
there was there was a little bit too
much similarity
everybody was just sort of a version of
Jake Tapper right I say that jokingly
but you know what I mean right everybody
is not too far from the same personality
but then you gotta go to go to Fox News
who's the uh Greg Gutfeld
of Fox News I'm sorry who's the Greg
guffeld of CNN
nobody there's nobody right it was the
Dana Perino who's the you know you could
go down the line
yeah who's the talker
right so the Fox News has personalities
who also give you the news yeah who's
the Tyrus right I mean the the examples
are yeah I could just keep going you
know who's the captain who's the you
know who's anybody
but that's a big difference and I think
that that's what Fox News does
brilliantly the other thing that Fox
News does brilliantly is who they
combine at the same time
it's just way better they just do it
yeah and Jesse Jesse Waters who's the
Jesse Waters
Jesse Waters by the way
I've been watching it for a long time
and especially when he's on the five
he does something I've never seen
anybody do and I didn't even know you
could pull it off
which is he plays almost a character
caricature of himself
in other words he plays a caricature of
somebody who doesn't care about Nuance
or the other side he's just going to
sort of take a political view and the
fact that he calls himself out as he's
doing it
is so wildly entertaining
that is just is insanely good TV I mean
it's really it's one of my favorite
things on television is watching Jesse
just being honest about the role he's
playing at that moment the other times
you know he plays other roles on
different shows and stuff but but oh my
God that is that is such a uh perfect
combination of Comedy
with actual news because the news he
says tends to be real news
so yeah I mean he does a great job
um
which by the way
I credit to Greg gotfeld
I don't know if Jesse Waters would want
to hear that or not but if you notice
the the Gutfeld effect when he's on the
five
how he changes the the interaction of
the group in other words he brings uh
greater danger to the group
and also greater greater danger because
he'll say more you know provocative
funny things and it allows them all to
be to have a larger playing field
because as long as he's the the craziest
one there everybody else can loosen up
because they're not going to get in
trouble as long as he's there like
Garfield protects all the rest of them
by taking the larger chance and and you
know making sure that everybody's having
a laugh
so that's the that is the magic of Fox
News is that they know that those
personalities work that way and that
they engineered it that way
quite brilliant
anyway
um
so yeah I think Jake Tapper was the
right choice uh it sounds like the fact
that they're going to move him back to
the afternoon means that it didn't work
out just ratings-wise but I do think
this is another sign that CNN serious
about finding the middle
um let's talk about two fake newses on
CNN today
I guess I didn't go too far
complimenting them I couldn't even get
to the next story all right here's some
fake news on CNN
today
uh it talks about a study showing that
drinking caffeinated coffee
uh if you're a mother could make your
children shorter
so just remember this is fake news
so we'll get to the fake part it's fake
news but they're reporting there's a
study correlating uh caffeine drinking
uh while you're pregnant with having
shorter kids
and they read all the way through the
through the story and you think to
yourself my God this is terrible I'll
never drink coffee again if I'm pregnant
and then you get to sort of the the last
part of the story that the last part of
the story and the expert says
I'm I'm paraphrasing yeah but the
correlation is probably with poverty
guess who guess who drinks more coffee
turns out it's rich people go to
Starbucks more than the poor I don't
know if you knew that did you know that
rich people drink more coffee than poor
people do you know there's a distinct
height difference between rich people
and poor people
for a variety of reasons yeah yeah the
whole thing was fake and the story
itself says it's fake but you have to
read through the fake part to get the
part where it says that's all made up
it's just it's just a random correlation
so I don't know maybe it's an
improvement that they report the news
and then they call it out as fake
themselves
seems like a step forward
um how many of you remember me at these
toward the beginning of the pandemic
saying something very provocative which
was
that the seasonal flu numbers that we
have every year are complete
and that we don't have 30 to 50 000
people dying of the flu because there's
no way I wouldn't know that
there's no way I could live in this
world and not be aware of that
right now how many people thought I was
right
how many how many people thought I was
right when I said that
oh a few of you did oh interesting I
guess I have more credibility than I
thought
well it turns out I'm right
at least I think I am so um
guess how many people have died of
seasonal flu so far this year but let me
give you some context the estimates had
always been that the number of people
dying from the regular seasonal flu was
30 to 50 000 a year right
30 to 50 000 a year were dying of the
regular flu how many people so far now
remember it's early in the flu season
it's early in the flu season but there's
but there is reportedly more flu than
ever before for the obvious reasons
right people stayed away from the
regular flu so long they don't have the
immunity
so the number the total number of people
who have died so far of the regular flu
is uh 360.
360. so far this year that that's it
360. do you think that by the end of the
year we'll get up to 50 000.
do you think it's going to be like a
really bad November in December
yeah
it turns out if you follow my thread and
I tweeted a thread from an account
called unhoodwinked which I recommend
and it's called Al Hoodwinked so look at
his thread that I tweeted showing how
the regular flu is counted
and turns out that it's counted in two
different ways
one of the ways is I think the cdc's
does it with an exit uh it's a excess
death estimate
they just look at how many people die
normally and then they look at the
winter they say oh there's extra people
dying in the winter that's got to be the
flu
and then there's another way where
apparently you come closer to Counting
them and if you count them you get 50
and 100 a year
on average
fifteen hundred if you do the estimate
way now both I think both of these are
official ways
I believe they exist simultaneously as
both official ways to count one is
thirty to fifty thousand the other is a
few hundred
and they both exist as official ways to
count
everything you knew about the seasonal
flu was big form of they were
poisoning you with their vaccinations
they had no benefit whatsoever
because it wasn't even a problem
I mean statistically obviously if you're
one of the 1500 people who dies that's a
problem now
obviously this is going to be skewing
told toward older people or the one at
risk from the flu or
people with various medical problems
that would have comorbidities I guess
but
can I say this I think I can say this
out loud now right that the seasonal flu
shot
is probably
a bad idea
now I'm not a doctor
so I won't say that with certainty I'll
just say that if you look at the full
context of the last few years
no reasonable person could think it's a
good idea
now I want to give you one uh possible
reason everything I just said is wrong
okay
possibly everything I just said is wrong
because the number of people who are
dying seems to be from
from pneumonia
right it looks like maybe the flu and
pneumonia numbers get combined
and the question I don't know the answer
to
is does the flu turn into pneumonia
they die of pneumonia it gets coded
pneumonia but really it was the flu that
killed them
can somebody give me a fact check on
that and
I'm saying yeses on that so it could be
that it is the flu
but it's the flu triggering pneumonia
and then the pneumonia kills you that it
is
but what
I don't have is a number of how how
often
flu isn't the one cause of pneumonia is
it
is it
don't you get pneumonia from a variety
of things
so
I don't know
I don't know so it could be
it could be
that the flu numbers are complete
 and you don't need the shot and
you never did
that that would actually fit
the evidence that we can confirm
but also
but also here's where I keep myself out
of trouble it's entirely possible that
we're just confusing pneumonia and flu
numbers and that if you want to not die
of pneumonia
maybe a flu shot helps if you're a
certain age I don't know I do not know
but I know that what I can determine so
far tells me I would not get the flu
shot at my current age in current health
if I'm 80
maybe I don't know I'll look into it
more but we can't trust anything now I
think we know that
all right uh here's the funniest story I
think in the news
um Gavin Newsom
believes that the problem in terms of
the polling that Republicans look like
they're ready to win them into herbs and
Gavin Newsom says the problem is that
the Republicans are quote winning the
messaging War
yeah that's the problem
it's it's the way the Republicans talk
about the message
yeah that's what's making the difference
Now isn't that just LOL
that's just LOL material isn't it like I
don't like to be the LOL guy
but this is this is LOL
if somebody said that to you in person
you wouldn't laugh
if Gavin Newsom stood in front of you
said you know
the polling is all going against us I
think it's I think it's because the GOP
is better at messaging
you wouldn't laugh out loud at that
I would laugh at his face with that not
not because I was being an but
because I would think it was funny
wouldn't you like I would think that's
literally funny okay yeah it's the
messaging
really
really it's the messaging that's the
problem
oh
well
um and this reminds me of an update I
should have given to you this early uh
the doctors for Paul Pelosi
um have an update uh physically it looks
like you'll have a full recovery but the
the doctors say that they can't save the
narrative
it looks like the narrative
The Narrative might die
yeah they couldn't save the narrative
you know this is when this is one of
those situations I I wish the live
audience could clap out loud
because come on
that was pretty good
they couldn't save the narrative
um
so even Newsome says that it goes to my
fundamental grievance with my damn party
he's even calling his own party is the
damn party he added we're getting
crushed on narrative
am I wrong
that if you're a political party
and then you create a bunch of policies
that people don't like and obviously
don't work
and then you also have trouble
describing why the policies that clearly
don't work are really awesome
are you not two levels away from reality
you're two levels away from reality
right the policy is out of whack with
reality because it doesn't like it
doesn't understand reality
and then beyond that the way you talk
about
the policy that doesn't understand
reality
also
departs from reality
so you you literally have two degrees of
reality separation between the average
candidate
and real reality the Democrats and they
think it's a messaging problem
now why do the Republicans have such a
good messaging discipline
let me ask you this
why do
Republicans have good messaging
discipline because it seems like they do
right they're saying parents they're
saying education they're saying crime
they're saying border
right they're saying inflation
well on one hand it's easy if those are
the things you were already saying right
so the Republicans are just saying the
same things they always say
they've just got a little extra ammo
because the Democrats are you know
creating mischief and education Etc so
they just have more ammo but it's kind
of their normal thing
all right here's another thing which I
don't know if you've realized
have you noticed that Fox News has been
running non-stop anecdotal stories of
physical criminal attacks
it's almost all black people attacking
non-black people almost all that you
know which bothers me I gotta say
um it bothers me not because it's not a
snapshot of reality because
unfortunately it is
it bothers me because what people see is
what they believe and if you feed them a
diet of one thing
that's pretty manipulative right now in
my opinion Fox News is a big part of why
the Republican messaging is disciplined
because if if as long as Fox News is
just hitting crime crime crime crime
people coming across the border here's
another picture here's another assault
here's another picture of Border people
here's another result
it's really it's easy to be on message
if the media that's sort of on your team
is making it that easy
they're making it pretty easy right now
I suppose you could argue that the the
Democrats could have taken the same cue
from the from the Democrat media
but could they
could they
I I don't know if it works that way
but it definitely works on the right the
right can look at Fox News they can say
well the running the running crime
stories every single night
so if I talk about crime I'm going to be
backed by the news you know the news
will have my back
so that all is a good ecosystem but I
don't know I feel like
I feel like the Democrats just complain
about Republicans
sort of all they do like I don't see any
coherent message or worse
the the message that the Democrats
decided on
was a conceptual one
we might lose our freedom
in our democracy
let me uh
let me compare two things
um
let's see
um you have two choices I'm going to
take your phone away from you
your physical phone they just take it
away from you that's one choice
or
you might lose
the you might get a slightly elevated
risk of uh damage to the democracy and
the Republic
in the long run
so which do you choose I'm either gonna
take your phone away
or or second choice is a slightly
elevated risk of the Republic being
distorted in a way you don't like
sometime in the future we're not sure
which topics exactly but it seems Seems
bad seems bad
that that's exactly what the contest
came to inflation
takes your money
right so the Democrats are taking your
money
but in return they're promising to
protect you from a vague
um some kind of attack on Democracy
because a guy with a bison hat or once
was in the two years ago I don't
understand how any of this makes sense
to me
right it's that they actually LED with a
concept
you can't be I'm taking your money
like out of your pocket with inflation
you can't be I'm taking your money with
a concept about something that's
you know three abstractions away from
meaning anything
and they did that
I feel as if the entire Democratic party
has no leadership whatsoever
because who who the hell is advising
right and Trump of course is playing it
brilliantly I think you know I worry
that Trump has a health problem because
he's too quiet lately
I just worry about maybe something's
going on there but or maybe he's busy
but the smartest thing he can do is just
stay quiet for a while
because the Democrats are just shooting
themselves you know what's the old
saying when your enemy is making
mistakes you know don't stop them
um perfect strategy just say well if
you'd like me back I'm here
that's all it would take
now we're uh related news apparently uh
Suburban women have switched fairly
quickly and radically toward the GOP
just an enormous switch
from being Democrat voters to GOP likely
voters
and we speculate what caused this switch
you say
you say crime right you say education
you say stay away from our children
right
here's what I say you're all wrong
inflation as well
inflation you're all wrong
all right I'm going to give you my
theory and it goes like this number one
inflation the education problem and the
crime problem have been the same all
year
would you agree
the the things that you said are the
reasons that they suddenly switched
because remember it's a sudden switch
you're saying they suddenly switched
because the things that have been true
for a whole year
is that your theory
why the sudden switch
only because they're pulling it
um here's my opinion and this will be
one that you haven't heard before
number one
if you're a mother when do you start
paying attention to politics
it's your lowest priority
is your lowest priority
your kids are your priority
so the obvious answer is they didn't
they weren't paying attention to
politics until now
right isn't that the most obvious
that the group that would least pay
attention to politics until it mattered
well what is one way to define a mother
like a good functioning mother who's
like really killing it in the mother
Department
what is the one thing you could say
about that mother
a an insane dedication to priorities
right
who handles priorities better than a mom
nobody nobody they they get those
priorities right just about every time
right and where was their priority to
follow politics nowhere nowhere
but when it comes when it's when it's
election day
then how important is it to the mom very
important very important the elections
are not important to parents until
election day because they have other
stuff to do you know you and I maybe we
were not you know parenting every day so
we just we got time to talk about this
stuff it's sort of a luxury
all right so that's my first reason uh
and I think it's strong my second reason
is going to be more clever
and you've also never heard this one
before it starts with a story told in uh
I think I heard this in Business School
do you remember the product Hamburger
Helper
it's still a product right Hamburger
Helper
so they would give you some noodles and
some spices
and then you'd have to bring your own
hamburger and like you know saute that
up and you combine it with their thing
and then you create a meal
here here's the story that you don't
know about Hamburger Helper
originally it was a complete product
originally it included the hamburger
here's the hamburger here's the rest of
stuff boom
and they couldn't sell it
why
here's here's the thing that'll blow
your mind they couldn't sell the the
Hamburger Helper when it was a better
product a more convenient product why
couldn't they do it was it about shelf
life it wasn't about shelf life it
wasn't about quality of the product the
quality of the product was fine
wasn't about anything going bad
it was about
mom did not feel like she was doing her
job unless it was a little harder
the the the mother who who took let's
say identity
from being the the housekeeper provider
remember this is years ago so we're this
is a less woke time
60s Hamburger Helper came out in the 60s
right roughly
maybe 50s I don't know something like
that but in those days you had more
traditional you know Mom Mom making
dinner
and mom didn't want to make dinner and
make it look like she didn't do any work
it would look like takeout
so she'd look like you know her brand
had been diminished so as soon as they
made it harder to do Hamburger Helper it
became a gigantic hit
because then Mom was cooking right it's
not cooking if you just opened the
package but if you're combining things
with other things you're cooking so now
she's cooking
all right
now fast forward
mom goes shopping
for anything
for uh for groceries
and then she realizes she's standing in
the store and she realizes that budget
is not what it used to be because of
inflation and now mom needs to make some
choices about food
and she she takes it down a level she
goes all right I guess we can't get any
fun food maybe we'll get hamburger
instead of steak
you know maybe more vegetables and less
less meat
how does mom feel when she knows that
she's going to bring home worse food
than she has ever brought home before
because she has to It's just in the
budget
how does mom feel
like a failure
even though it's not her failure it's
not mom's fault mom's doing the right
thing right managing the budget
but Mom is going to take the hit
at the dinner table
mom is going to take a hit from the kids
where's my Donuts well we can't afford
them now she's going to take it from Dad
why do we have uh
what do you call it flat steak instead
of good steak can't afford it
the mother's reputation cannot handle
the effects of inflation
it's not just about everything's
expensive it's about making mom look
like an to the rest of the
family
that's what happened
inflation looks makes mom look like an
 to the rest of the the rest of
the family they're just mad that she
didn't buy what she used to buy and it's
not her fault it's not her fault now you
tell me your government's going to make
you look like an and it's not
your fault
who the am I going to vote for
I'm not going to vote for the one that
makes me look like an in front
of my own family
even if it's not my fault and it isn't
all right
how about that theory
and nobody gave you that theory before
did they
yeah now it's not one thing and it's not
two things it's probably five different
you know major things that cause cause
the shift but I think I think this is
part of it
and I think the Hamburger Helper story
really gives you some insight on how
that could possibly be true
did I tell you this would be the best
live stream you've ever seen
two sniffs
exhale
not only are you healthier than you've
ever been before
because this breathing thing
smarter too
in fact when you you when you're talking
to people you're going to bring up this
hamburger helper thing and people are
going to be like
wow
you're pretty smart
all right you you have my permission
do not credit me for this
right if you want to bring this up in
conversation you can even tweet it
I'm giving you full uh intellectual
property release
I if anybody says Hey somebody stole
your idea I'll say oh I don't think so I
think great minds think alike
I'll back you
I'll back you I'll say no no that was
sort of obvious I think the smart people
all got there the same way
probably had nothing to do with me
right so that is my gift to you you'll
be the smartest ones at your holiday
parties
um
uh yeah uh
today we hear the ESG fund flows are way
down from 2021 meaning fewer people are
investing in ESG rated companies now ESG
is environment
social good and governance right so ESG
is trying to measure whether companies
are good for the environment
they have good diversity and they're
they're basically a social good
and critics such as myself say that's a
terrible idea because you don't want to
insert some entity between a company and
their customers and their investors you
never want to insert an entity just ever
it never works and
so the fun I just eyeballed it but it
looked like uh Investments are down 80
or so from 2021.
about 80 percent now a big part of that
is that just people are putting less
money into the market because the market
is down
so the Market's down itself
but I got a feeling it's more than the
market
I get a feeling that people are wising
to it it's specifically we know that
when people get a choice to invest in
ESG companies in their own 401K what do
they say
uh fewer than 10 percent of uh investors
who are making their own decisions chose
to allocate money to ESG funds when it
was offered in their 401k
fewer than 10 percent
you know I'm surprised
that it wasn't 25 percent
you know why right because I always joke
that 25 percent of people get every
question wrong it doesn't matter what
the question is is 25 get it wrong if
you could get all the way down to 10 got
it wrong
that is not normal that means that the
thing is so bad that the 25 rule doesn't
even apply and you've got to really push
to get past 25 right but apparently the
average investor just says that I'm
not I'm not going to put my money in
this in this bad idea
all right here are things that in my
opinion died from scrutiny this year
and this is an extension of my Basket
Case theory that I applied to people
that everybody looks like they're in
better shape than you are until you get
to know them
and then once you know all the problems
you're like well that's a basket case
it turns out it's everybody
everybody you just have you don't know
them well enough if you think they're
not a basket case but it turns out that
involves that applies to most large
organizations as well right does uh
apple look like a pretty solid
organization it does it does if you're
looking from the outside at Apple wow
that looks like a company's got their
 together what do you think it would
look like if you worked there
same
no it would look like a show if
you're on the inside
if you're on the inside you'd be saying
is it my imagination or have we not
invented one awesome thing since Steve
Jobs died right on the inside it's just
going to look like luck and impetus and
it's a good thing that nobody's wised up
to the fact that they haven't made
anything new Lately by the way I own
Apple stock so I'm dumping on them but
it's it's only hurting me
um
so anyway I take this concept that the
more you know about something the worse
it looks would you agree the more you
know about something the worse it looks
it's typically true so here are some
things that died from scrutiny
right things you thought might have been
good or at least you were open to it but
now that you actually got to see the
inner workings you're like all right
things which died from scrutiny this
year Biden's alleged competence
it's gone right do you remember when
people said yeah he talks funny and
maybe it's just because he had a uh you
know speech problem but he's basically
all there
does anybody think that now
I I don't think Democrats think so
so the scrutiny was we got to actually
see him as president and then we found
out oh yeah he's way worse than it
looked on the surface right
how about Progressive Democrat policies
when Progressive Democrat policies are
originally floated
people can say well I like it and people
can say I don't like it and they could
have their reasons but you don't really
know
the way you know for sure is to
implement the policies which
unfortunately happened such as defund
the police
and now you can actually see the the
inner workings of progressive Democrat
policies and how do they look
do they look better
or do they look worse once you can see
the details worse right so scrutiny
killed that how about BLM
did Black lives matter survive greater
scrutiny nope nope greater scrutiny
turned out to show that the organizers
were scammers
apparently how about ESG
did ESG start out with sounding like an
awesome idea but the more you looked at
it
yes
how about uh
the anti-nuclear movement
remember that was a big thing
gone as soon as you looked into nuclear
enough
you found out that the anti-nuclear
stuff was just all it wasn't
based on any good thinking
how about the vaccination program
the more you looked into it did it look
better or worse I don't even have to
finish that do I right
how about experts in general
medical experts mostly but experts in
general
did we not learn a lot more about
experts in general in the last two years
we did
and the more we learned about the
experts
did they look better they look worse
they look worse much worse
how about uh
well everything
yeah
basically everything we see DC
everything we looked into in any kind of
detail looked worse
that's probably just a rule of the
universe every time you look into it it
looks worse so anyway that's the basket
case Theory applied to basically
everything
looks looks worse when you're on the
inside
all right
um
foreign
so China continues to be unsafe for
business I saw a story that the area
where I guess the area where Apple makes
most of his iPhones in China is now
under lockdown
can somebody confirm that
because that would be like a really big
problem I remember uh Apple seemed like
the one company that maybe because they
had so much clout
Apple seemed like the one company that
could do business in China and maybe
make it work
because you know Apple's like so
powerful
and now it turns out that even apple is
going to have some trouble because just
being in China is a problem because
they're going to close it down
um so China is unsafe for business even
if you're Apple
uh however I would like to give you this
Counterpoint from Naomi Wu on Twitter
who's also a great follow
now Naomi is Chinese and
can give you like a different
perspective on now people you know look
and feel there
uh and one of the things she points out
is that the uh the China zero covet
policy worked
and by that she says that they got past
the
um the bad variant of covet and now even
if it flares up they're still on zero
covet but even if it flares up it's
going to flare up in in the less
dangerous way
and I thought to myself
that's not a bad opinion
it does look like it worked
because if China knew that the variant
would flame out
and most experts predicted that right
did not the experts say that the the
virus would flame out to lesser variants
I feel like we knew that so if China
played the game to see if they could
wait long enough to get past the first
variant
they won
because they because they stayed in
business for the most part except for
the closed down parts now was it a
gigantic burden on the people who got
closed down of course
of course
but that's leadership unfortunately
leadership is screwing some people for
the greater good like it's hard it's
hard to not screw somebody
I don't think they destroyed their
economy I don't think the shutdown
destroyed their economy
uh other things might but I don't think
that so I don't know I think you could
make an argument that China played it
right for China like it's not something
that would have worked in the United
States but do you do you buy that at
least the argument
has some some meat on it you wouldn't
dismiss the argument at a hand would you
it's interesting because you know
nobody's more critical of China than I
am but they might have played it right
they might have
yeah
all right I'll just put that out there I
don't think we can know for sure
um Mike cernovich is surfacing a story
that I tried to understand as best I
could he's got some long threads on it
but apparently something like this has
happened
um
back in 2017 when Roy Moore was running
for office for Senate I guess Uh Russian
a whole bunch of Russian Bots became
started following him and then that
became a story hey why does Russia like
this guy so much
well it turns out that Democrats
are the ones who created all the bots
made them look like Russian Bots and
then planted the news story that Russian
Bots love this Republican
and got caught
so you know that's all water under the
bridge now right
can't go back in time but at least we
caught him so we know how bad they were
so that's the end of the story right
or is it
um as much points out uh someone who
worked for a group that was organizing
these this fake Russian bot thing
um is on the 2022 integrity
team at
uh for Twitter
is it Twitter is integrity I don't know
they're on somebody's Integrity team so
that's the part I don't know is it
Twitter or is it just social media
it's Twitter right
Twitter's Twitter only
or also Twitter
that's the part I wasn't I didn't
connect the story quite right before I
got on here
I think it's Twitter but anyway this is
the sort of fox and the hen house
problem that we need to be vigilant of
and this is again why you know Mike
cernovich is like a
National Treasure basically because you
know he can do some things that other
people just don't do or don't notice or
don't talk about or something but it all
seems like important stuff when he's
involved and this is pretty big deal
that's a pretty big deal
and but at least we caught it so here's
another example where transparency works
all right somebody tried to do something
a little bit of transparency probably
will modify it I would think because
it'd be kind of embarrassing to just go
on like it like nobody noticed
so we'll see what happens with that
um
Twitter has a moderation Council so Elon
Musk said they're going to put together
a Content moderation Council it'll
include representatives and here's the
key phrase with wildly Divergent views
which will certainly include the Civil
Rights community and groups who face hay
fuel violence
what do you think of that Twitter will
have a Content moderation policy with
wildly Divergent views that's good right
don't you like to have a diversity of
opinions
you like diversity of opinions wildly
Divergent views now he didn't say that
they'll be racially balanced
he said it the right way
the right way is wildly Divergent views
so that's good right
here's the problem
here's the problem I'm gonna have to
show this to you visually
to get the full sense of it here
and uh so I tweeted back to the it was
Elon Musk tweet
and I had one problem with the idea of a
wildly Divergent group of people
and the problem is
that when you put together a committee
that is wildly diverged opinions
it's the first panel of a Dilbert comic
so I tweeted back I tweeted back to the
the beginning of the comic that I'll be
drawing later today
because I can't think of anything that
would be a better Dilbert comic than
forming a wildly Divergent committee a
committee with a wildly Divergent
opinions so this will be the first panel
I'm this will be the boss talking I'm
creating an external advisory Council of
people who have wildly Divergent views
now you ask me
now you tell me
can I make a joke out of that
could I make a joke out of a
helpful Council of people with wildly
Divergent views
and when I tweeted it I asked this
question
has a small group with wildly Divergent
views ever accomplished anything
anything like anything ever
was there ever one case in the whole
world
where a small group and and the emphasis
is a small group a large group of people
with wildly Divergent views definitely
works like you can win while World War
II with a wildly Divergent group as long
as they you know agree on the war part
you can form America yeah the United
States is a is a country of wildly
Divergent views that works
but have you ever seen a small group
small group with wildly Divergent views
they got something done
my understanding is the best case
scenario for a small group
is a bunch of average people with one
leader who's really good
that tends to work
because it's the leader who just gets
their way but you know has the advantage
of lots of voices to you know modify the
viewers the leader's opinion but usually
the leader is the smartest person
you know well not always but but in
terms of you know uh informal leadership
not necessarily organizational
leadership the smartest person tends to
have a little more influence because
people go oh what do you think you're
the smartest
so small groups of people I don't know
and then somebody said to me Scott he
didn't say he would take their opinions
to which I said oh
okay I'm okay with that
you know if all he does is listen to
them
that works now let me let me offer a way
that this could work
the the small group of wildly differing
people could say maybe and maybe Elon
Musk knows this is what's going to
happen they could say we shouldn't ban
anything unless we're unanimous
then you'd have something
then you'd have something
we won't ban anything unless it's
unanimous among a wildly Divergent bunch
of opinions if one person says this
should be allowed
that's free speech
in fact I don't even know if you could
Define it better
find me a more functional description of
free speech
than a wildly Divergent group of people
with different opinions
all say
or at least one of them says it should
be allowed
if if even one person says it should be
loud
should it be allowed
it's an interesting question isn't it
I feel like yes
I feel like one yes is enough to keep it
but if you had a wildly Divergent group
wouldn't they say everything stays
would they say everything stays
remember they're wildly Divergent
so would they allow uh tweets to say we
should round up and murder all of the
I'm not going to fill in the name of the
group right
do you think that the wildly Divergent
group would allow somebody to say
um we should round up this group and
kill them
well that would be that would be against
the terms of service
so that's easy right hate speech so they
wouldn't even have to make a decision on
that one
because the terms of service would take
care of it and nobody really argues I
don't think people argue about
that level of hate speech in your terms
of service that seems like a a
reasonable business standard
so there are two possibilities with this
wildly Divergent group one is a perfect
outcome
which is Elon says if you can't agree I
make the decision
that's perfect
and if you do agree
I'm really going to take that as
serious
I'd be okay with that
would you would you be okay as long as
musk makes the decision
and he's got a really tough standard
about what's going to influence him from
this group
I'd be okay with that because the
problem is you can't get a perfect
system
no such thing as a perfect system right
now what's the problem with this system
what happens when somebody replaces Elon
Musk in that job
because that's going to happen someday
right
and what happens then well then you're
down to trusting that one person again
so there's some risk but I don't have a
better idea
so if we're living in the real world
where the best idea has to win not a
perfect idea it might be the best idea
it might be but that doesn't make it not
a material for a Dilbert comic
right if if the story had said I'm not
going to believe them or follow them
unless it's unanimous
that I couldn't make it into a Dilbert
comic you know that right
think about that if the additional part
of the story which didn't happen but it
could
said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna ban
anybody unless it's unanimous
I couldn't make fun of that could I
there would be no place to go with that
and that's why the that's why when uh
musk says the standard for Tesla is that
if it would appear in a Dilbert comic
you know maybe rethink it it's not a
good idea
if you just tell me you're gonna have a
wildly Divergent Council that's
definitely going to be a Dilbert comic
if you tell me you're not going to
listen to them unless they're unanimous
and it's about Free Speech where you
really really want to be careful
then I don't have anything
because that just sounds like a pretty
good system to me I don't know if it'll
work maybe it works maybe it doesn't but
I wouldn't mock it as an idea as an idea
it's sensible
right
um
Twitter user roly-poly had this thought
uh what happens when musk combines
neural Link in Twitter
and and was that part of the play
I mean did he ever think to himself you
know
someday I might have this neural link
thing embedded in my house I'm worried
that uh the way I would use it is that
whenever I'm in a bad mood it will
automatically tweet insults at people
you know I'd just be like thinking and
then something
I really hate that guy and also the
Tweet would pop out
I don't know could be fun
I I doubt that's a big part of his
strategy but when you own neurolink and
you own Twitter
I feel like they might be able to work
together
you know think think of the things that
musk does that do work together
do you think the boring company that
bores tunnels do you think that has
anything to do with Mars
I do because I I feel like living on
Mars would require a lot of tunneling
I don't know and and at least see what's
under the ground so you know if there
was previous civilizations and stuff now
it'd be pretty tough to get a a boring
machine to Mars and of course it uh it
couldn't work on gas right
so how would the boring machine work if
it's on Mars
would have to be battery batteries
so so he's making the batteries he's
making the tunneling machine he's going
to Mars probably need to do a lot of
underground stuff on Mars because of the
harshness of the atmosphere I don't know
it feels like it all fits together
Kerry Lake
dunked on Cheney
um Liz Taylor is that her name is your
first name Liz
do I have the right Cheney it's Liz
right uh lizard uh so Liz Cheney was
raising money and to do ads trying to
beat Carrie Lake
who are in the same party interestingly
enough but Cheney's becoming more of an
anti-republican
and here's what Kerry Lake said because
apparently she used it for her own
fundraising and she said thank you for
your generous in-kind contribution to my
campaign your recent television ad and
she went on saying that basically it all
worked in her favor you know yeah yeah
but
she thinks it'll add another 10 points
to their lead but here's the part that
uh I loved
so she closes out
um she closes in her opinion
by saying uh I know America she talks
about uh thank you again for the huge
Boost store campaign enjoy your forced
retirement for politics because Cheney's
already been defeated Lake concluded and
she said I know America will rest easier
knowing that one one more war Monger is
out of office I thought to myself
warmonger
warmongers are really good
political insult
warmonger
who wants to vote for a warmonger that
really kind of sticks doesn't it
seems kind of sticky
warmonger
is there some news about yay I see
somebody mentioning yay
did something happen with yay
news I didn't say anything today
all right let me know if I missed
something
um
so Kerry Lake continues to be the the
most dangerous politician out there
um somebody asked if this was an example
of agreeing and amplifying or matching
and amplifying it is not is more of a
it's more of an example of um
satire or sarcasm
um
what do you think Twitter should do as
it's looking to tweak his features uh do
you think you should get rid of all
Anonymous accounts
how should it treat a fully Anonymous
accounts
here's my opinion
uh my opinion is that Anonymous accounts
should be allowed
but you should have the option to not
see them
or to you should have an option of
making a new show at the bottom of your
comment feed
you know if I could include them but
include them at the bottom of my comment
feed optionally right so it'd be my
choice whether I see them or not it's
not Twitter's choice
I'd be okay with that
yeah so I think I think musk wants a
choose your own experience kind of
Twitter where you just have an option of
what kind of goodness and Badness you
want to experience that works for me
yeah that works for me
um
but it is true that a lot of them are
just bad people they're just bad people
two sniffs and an exhale
there we go
feels good oh yeah
Scott people are not Fe Rich we need
them yeah we need we need Anonymous
people who
need to stay Anonymous I agree
but I mostly don't want to see them
I mostly don't want to see them
all right
I think no isn't it two inhales
and one exhale
do I have it backwards I see somebody
fact checking me on the huberman method
I've seen the I think I've seen it both
ways
I think I've seen
yeah I've seen it both ways I think
maybe Wim Hof has the opposite
I think the huberman method and the Wim
Hof are opposite now
here's here's why I say that I think
that the active part is the exhale
right in my opinion the exhale is the
active part
and that people don't when you breathe
shallowly when you breathe shallow
Lee
when your breath is shallow you don't
exhale the you know the bad air that's
been hanging around I feel like the
exhaling is the part that that makes a
difference right
so every one of these other ways from
meditation to exercise to breathing
methods I think the only part you have
to get right is a frequent good exhale
who's with me it's the actual that makes
a difference Andrew whale also says that
yeah because you can't avoid inhaling
inhaling is optional I'm sorry exhaling
fully is optional inhaling is not really
optional you're going to do that anyway
uh Andrew uh whale does agree okay yeah
breathing's probably the whole thing
so if you're breathing right you get
your mushrooms if you need them you're
going to be in good shape good good
shape all right have I met my test
I've made you all healthier I've helped
your anxiety I have helped your overall
health I've helped you with decisions on
flu shots I've helped you with if you
know somebody on serious depression you
know what will work for that
and I've given you a story to make you
smart with the Hamburger Helper and I've
made you smarter than the people that
you'll be talking to on Thanksgiving
did you get your money's worth
right you got your money's worth I think
so
truly Sensational and we have some
laughs as well
I believe this is the most useful
live stream in the history of all live
streams
so he says brag much
Henry Henry the people with uh damaged
egos you need to spend more time here
because I can help you with that
right
it's okay for it's uh it's okay for
people to be successful and even talk
about it
it even talk about it and Henry should
you be successful or something I'd love
to hear about it
and I'm not going to tell you that
you're bragging
because when you do something well you
should tell people
the world is not worse for that the
world is better for that you don't have
to be a jerk but tell us what you got
right tell us what you got wrong and
then we know who you are
and we know how to deal with the next
thing you say so ranking my own success
and failures
is an integral part of what I do I will
be bragging more not less
and I will be also admitting when I'm
wrong I hope hopefully more
in terms of the admitting apart
I hope I'm not wrong more
so I'm going to do more of what you say
I should less of
uh ignore jury solution
the jury solution what was it remind me
again the jury solution j-u-r-y
what was that
was that breathing as well
The hoax monger
hoax Monger that's not bad
oh he calls his technique the site the
physiological Psy yeah you know here's
what I found I found that when you do
the exhale
the one that makes the difference I find
it helps to allow my body to lean into
it and just let all my muscles go with
it like
like actually just collapse your muscles
just let everything go
that feels that feels like that's what
makes the difference
uh
Japanese free divers are all about the
Deep exhale okay make sense
all right
yes we're practicing breathing
yes like a good bong hit
all right I think we've killed it today
let's uh let's end now in a high note
YouTube thanks for joining you're all
smarter and healthier now
bye
