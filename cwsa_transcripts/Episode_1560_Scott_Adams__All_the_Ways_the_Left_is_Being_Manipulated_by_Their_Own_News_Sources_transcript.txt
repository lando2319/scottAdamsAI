good morning everybody
ladies and gentlemen and everything else
what a day we have today
wow
wow
it's gonna be so good
let me start
by showing how i fixed uh ipad's design
problem
you've probably heard that apple
computer does pretty good job on design
well not good enough uh i had to take
the ipad and fix it myself and i'll show
you how i did it
with one of my ipads here
uh see here's my ipad
and then if you see let's see
see right here
see this thing
this is a little sticky thing that i
added myself
do you know why
because every time i want to turn on or
off my ipad
or i want to change the volume
i have to search all four corners
because they look identical and the ipad
can work in any orientation
so from the front
you can't tell where the power button is
the on and off switch and you can't tell
where the volume is so on each of my
ipads i had to modify them so i know
which corner the stuff is
because otherwise i have a one in four
chance of getting it right on the first
time
so my experience of the ipad is always
the same
wow this
ipad is a miracle of design and
and function
okay let's turn it on
damn it
damn it
damn it
i hate my ipad but at least it's on
that's right
every single time i turned my ipad on or
off
i
hated it
and i hated the designers who did this
to me
i don't get it on the first try ever it
feels like it should be one and four you
get to get it on the first try but it
feels like zero
now don't get me started about who
created the micro usb
standard
have you ever used the micro usb here
let me let me give you an example
i'll do the simultaneous sip in a moment
here but
let me give you anything god damn it i
really is this the time i'm not going to
be able to find
i'm going to go into a swearing rant in
about a second
come on there we go all right so here's
here's a micro usb
now they made it so that there's a a
right way to go in and the wrong way so
you know this is right sometimes and
that's right sometimes and let me show
you how
uh the micro usb standard works so here
are my headphones
and these headphones of course
you can charge them
now the headphones look very similar on
the left and the right
so because the people who make these
headphones
suck
and i hate them like
like i hate anything
so you first have to figure out which of
the two places has the has the place you
plug it in
so i first go uh well let's
wait
it's sort of dark in here i can't even i
don't know can you see the black hole on
the black
it's usually dark when i use these you
know
so you're like feeling around
where is it
oh
is this one this one so there's a 50
chance you get it
so then once you find it
that you have to get the usb into it let
me show you how to do that so here's
here's the usb hole
and
you see that doesn't go in there do you
know why
because that's not the usb hole
that's just a little indentation exactly
where the usb hole would be on the other
one
that's right they have a fake usb hole
on one of the two places it could be
they hate you whoever made these they
hate you
all right so this is the real usb hole
right here now you notice how it's made
so that if you don't get it exactly in
the hole
on the first try it'll just
it doesn't it doesn't guide you into the
hole
and make sure
that if you don't hit it on the first
try
[Music]
it doesn't go in all right but let's say
you were more careful
and you you could find it
then here's how you get in yet remember
you have to get it in right side up
so
here it is
sliding right into the hole
okay so it doesn't go in this way
so if it doesn't go in this way
obviously it's the other way so you turn
it upside down and then you put it into
the hole
um
okay it doesn't go into the hole the
other way because it turns out that the
first way was the correct way but
because the stupid device is so poorly
designed you can't even tell if it's the
right way
so you turn it back to the way that it
wasn't working and you say why isn't it
going into the hole
and then you get it in there
and then by the time you use your device
you hate it
you hate this thing
so
how about the simultaneous sip
[Laughter]
i don't know maybe it's just me
complaining about this stuff but all you
need is a cup or a mug or a glass a
tanker gel system in a canteen yoga
plastic vessel of any kind fill you with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
being here today thing that makes
everything better except your micro usb
connection it's called the simultaneous
sep
it happens now go
oh yeah
that's good
i saw a tweet that said uh
the the one thing that uh this is from
jason malk on twitter
he talks about being literate in the
future isn't going to be just reading
and writing
but because ai and robots and stuff will
be taken over everything
we also need to teach kids
things that kids can do that
you know maybe robots and ai can't do
and the example given would be uh
you know an eight-year-old can google
something and a robot can plow
but what ai can do is arrange living
symphonies
that's why ai can't do it it can't
arrange a living symphony
but you know what it can do
hasn't done it yet
but do you know what ai can do
it can make music that you would like a
lot better than a living symphony made
by humans
like a lot better
so
at the moment ai can't write a write
music that you would like to listen to
in the long run
it's all going to be ai
it's all going to be a because once once
ai is better
and it will be better because it can a b
test
parts of a song sounds it can a b test a
chord
it could a b test like one chord
put it out to a million people and say
how do you like this chord
and if enough people say yes they'll put
some of this in the song how do you like
this lyric
all right a lot of people like this one
don't like this one we'll put the good
one in there ai could build a song that
would be the number one song in the
world period it would make you tingle
it would just
reprogram your brain
that's how good ai will be
to make music so i wouldn't assume that
music is the safe place
how about fine art
do you think a ai will be able to make a
painting that would be as awesome as our
best human painters
well it can't do anything like that now
but it will
it will
yeah
ai will look at all the gray paintings
it'll uh test all the components of it
it'll break it down and figure out what
parts of it make it interesting to
people and then it will make paintings
that are way better than what a person
can make
if you were to buy a human painting you
would only be because of the novelty
that oh look a human did pretty good on
this one pretty good not as good as the
ai obviously but it's pretty good for a
human
you know the same way we're impressed by
cave wall carvings
anyway
the continued emasculation of
vice president harris's
husband is ongoing
i saw this tweet by keaney rogers
she tweets at a french cookware store
i guess
i guess the
the vp is in france
so at a french cookware store the vp
says the second gentleman her husband
learned how to cook during covid
quote uh i guess the husband said she
taught me during covid out of necessity
after i almost burned down the apartment
he adds
how does that make you feel
now
here's what i like and don't like about
it on one hand
i do like the fact
that um
she's flipping the uh you know the
gender roles
i kind of like that i mean any anything
that just shakes you up and
you know makes you uncomfortable i
usually like
if it makes you uncomfortable i probably
like it
so the fact that she's uh very
conspicuously becoming the
uh i'll use this in the the traditional
historic sense
in the historic sense she's become the
man of the family
she literally wears the pants
literally
wears the pants
and
and the suit and the husband stays home
and takes care of the house and
apparently he's cooking now
i had to add to that tweet by saying
sadly the french cookware store did not
carry the french maid uniform the vp
ordered the second gentleman to wear
around the house
i don't know how much worse the
emasculation can get
but i think he's coming to this
i think he'll actually be wearing some
kind of a french-made outfit around the
house as he's dusting
looking forward to that
um
but let me also say i don't really care
you know it doesn't bother me what
nature the relationship
is in their family that's purely their
business
it's just interesting that they're
they're flipping the uh the gender roles
all right here's a horrible story um
so there was an astronaut that went up
on blue origin's flight with bezos so
this was just a month ago a guy you know
a private citizen gets to go on a rocket
ship into space
and that turned out well and then a
month later he dies in a private plane
he died in a cessna 172 with some other
people
they don't know the cause of the of the
problem yet but i'll tell you a little
bit that i know about aviation
because as you know my wife is a pilot
and the aircraft that he died in is the
exact one she spends most of her time in
it's it's a cessna 172 which is uh i
think the cessna 172 is like the most
common small aircraft there are a lot of
them
but here's what you need to know about
the cessna 172. again i'm just sort of
talking based on stuff i've heard being
around pilot talk
um if you're flying that kind of an
aircraft you usually want to hang around
somewhere there where there's a road
have you ever heard that you want to
make sure that you can see a
sizeable street
from wherever you're flying and the
reason is if you have a mechanical
difficulty you still have a pretty good
glide path
and so you could at least glide onto a
street which wouldn't be clean but it's
better than a forest
so the fact that he went down into he
went down in a wooded area
probably limits the possible problems to
the following
yeah i i i know where you're going with
this um
some of you are pilots so you're ahead
of me already
um
probably
so one of two problems one is he or the
pilot
diverted from where they could see a
street
so once they had mechanical problems
maybe they didn't have any option of any
place to land so that would have been
maybe a pilot error
if that happened because it is i think
it's pretty basic
to to keep a road in view
all right if somebody's a pilot could
you fact check me on that is it pretty
basic to make sure that you can see a
street
give me a fact check on that i know
there's some pilots watching this
so i think it is so i would rule out um
mechanical difficulty i'll also tell you
that
in these small aircraft
the number of times they have mechanical
difficulty in the air is shockingly high
shockingly high
the number of times they get 5000 feet
in the air
and the engine starts sputtering
it's way more than you think
but
experienced pilots almost always can
overcome the minor problems
the number one reason the small aircraft
crash is anybody what's the number one
reason
that small aircraft crash
well pilot error yes but i'm being i
want to be more specific yeah it's pilot
error but specifically pilot error
the answer is people who accidentally go
from vfr to ifr
so vfr means visual flying meaning you
can see well
so you can fly fine because you've got
lots of visibility
ifr means that suddenly there might have
been a cloud cover that they misjudged
and if you get in the clouds
the 172 might have i think it has
the ability to fly ifr meaning you could
fly instruments but only if you were
good at it
only if you were good at it right it's
not good enough that the that the plane
can fly ifr the pilot has to be able to
fly it
so there's
uh if i had to guess
this is just pure speculation
if i had to guess i would say the most
likely situation is there was some cloud
cover but we haven't heard about that
so wait to hear yeah john f kennedy jr
perfect example yes
um and pilots are so afraid of that
situation
going from vfr to instrument you know
low visibility
that uh i think even though some some of
the people who teach
how to fly on instruments have never
flown in clouds
let me say that again the people who
teach you
how to fly
in the clouds
some of them i don't think have ever
flown in the clouds because it's too
dangerous even if you know how
that's how dangerous it is
and you say well how do they learn to
teach it if they've never flown in it
they have something called foggles
a special kind of goggles that cover um
the top of your site so you can only see
the instruments
so they practice with their their vision
obscured you know with a pilot who can
see in the back usually or the front
anyway that's your little uh aviation
knowledge for the day
um i saw an excellent persuasive tweet
that might not work the way the tweeter
hoped you might be familiar with the
doctor robert malone
i'll put him in the category of
contrarian doctors about the pandemic
specifically
so he's one of these rogue contrarian
doctors one of the inventors of the mrna
technology i guess
so he's really highly qualified so
that's the first thing you need to know
if there was somebody you wanted to
listen to he'd be
exactly the kind of credentials
you do want to look at so he has some
you know lots of differences about
the pandemic from the uh
from the mainstream uh stuff
and he tweeted a picture of
himself next to a picture of big bird
because big bird is being employed to
persuade children to get vaccinated
and then robert malone md
tweets uh
of the pictures of his picture next to
big bird he goes your call
who are you going to listen to
i give you well-sourced information and
try to help you to be able to interpret
it for yourself
cnn and the legacy media gives you
propaganda
usg big pharma lies and cartoon
characters designed to sell jabs
directly to children
all right so who do you believe
do you believe the highly qualified
doctor who's
whose experience is exactly the kind of
experience you'd want or do you believe
big bird
which one is more credible
big bird or a doctor with the exact
credentials you'd want to see
here's the answer it's a
tie it's a tie
do you know why
because what
dr malone offers is to show you
well-sourced information this is his own
words
and to help you be able to interpret it
for yourself
that's not a thing
that's not a thing
you can't you can't show me your
well-sourced information and expect me
to interpret it correctly
how the hell am i going to do that
i can't do that
so who am i going to believe big bird
who is essentially a front character for
the entire
medical pharma community
you know the let's say the majority not
entire
versus the rogue doctor who is in a
category of people who are usually wrong
the rogue doctor
is usually wrong
now
everything that changes
starts with you know one person who's
the rogue doctor and then eventually
other people get persuaded but how often
does that happen
versus how often the rogue doctor is
just wrong
i would say experientially
you know without any science to back it
i would say experientially the rogue
doctor on any topic
is wrong 95 of the time
wouldn't you say
does your experience give you a
different result
it's only when they get it right that
it's such a big story it's like oh my
god
the person who was the only lone voice
got it right that's why you think it's a
bigger deal than it is because it's
always a story
if the loan outlier gets it right do you
remember in 2016 some of you remember
that i predicted before most people
that trump would win in 2016.
now why is it that everybody heard of
that
why is it that i was
somewhat famous in america for that
prediction i mean i was
invited on shows or articles written
about it
why was i famous for that
because it was a rogue
outlier opinion that was right
it was rare
the reason i got pressed is because it
was so rare to be a contrarian and be
right
right so anytime you see a contrarian
you can you know i say you should give
them full respect of
listening to them especially if they
have a credentials that dr malone has
those are serious credentials right if
you're going to ignore somebody with
that kind of credentials
well do it at your risk i'm just saying
that don't assume they're right
the odds are
are way against it but they might be
this could this could be the five
percent you never know
um all right
uh newt gingrich tweeted also about
kamala harris
that uh she he said uh why is kamala
harrison paris france
worrying about the polish belarus border
which is actually what's happening
instead of being in paris texas worrying
about the u.s mexican border
did she misunderstand biden when he
when he made her in charge of the border
and
i said to myself you know this is
suboptimal situation
we got these big problems in america and
our vice president is
in europe that is suboptimal
you know why it's suboptimal
because europe isn't quite far enough
if we could get the vice president
entirely on the other side of the world
i'd feel a little more comfortable
um maybe if she would go up in one of
those blue origin or elon musk flights
get her off the earth entirely
feel a little more comfortable about
that
all right here's some gavin newsom fake
news gavin newsom governor of new york
there's a manipulated video that's
really diabolical
that makes him look like he's smiling
creepily when he's talking
so somehow they i guess the technology
exists now that you can manipulate
somebody's mouth on a video
uh i mean we had that capability for a
long time but it looks like maybe it's
easy to do now
and so so the governor is talking
but he's got sort of a like crazy joker
mouth
and it's really creepy
now
i don't know how anybody could think
that was real
right
it didn't look real to me but apparently
some people did
um
so that's the first
newsome fake news
all right um
do you know the uh
the author and investment advisor robert
uh key
kiyosaki i think he wrote rich dad poor
dad
fairly famous for financial advice
and i saw a tweet by dr parikh patel
who's got lots of financial
qualifications it looks like
and he showed a graph uh showing the
stock market
and you know it's and his climb for
years and years with uh
robert
kiyosaki's
predictions that it was going to crash
oh it's going to crash
it's going to crash
totally going to crash
oh it's going to crash you're going to
be so sorry when it crashes and
apparently he hasn't been right yet at
least
in the long term he hasn't been right
but here's what i say about this
number one
investment advice is basically
horoscopes with math
would you put your money
into an investment based on a horoscope
no
well don't don't put your money on
anything based on investment advice
either because they're just horoscopes
with math
nobody knows what's happening in the
future
nobody understands the future nobody
there's no investment
advisor who knows the future
the only thing you can do is diversify
and if you have enough money you might
you know make take some risky bets on a
few things
you know that like high-tech things
but
i just gave you all the investment
advice you'll ever need
you know it could be like one page
that's it
diversify you know get the get the
fortune 500 index
and uh that's that's 90 of what you need
right there
so
um
but let me say what uh robert kiyosaki
is doing
wisely
if a big crash doesn't come is anybody
going to
say oh you got that wrong
or is he going he's just going to say
well it hasn't happened yet what's going
to happen so being wrong about a crash
generally doesn't hurt you
right
you predict a crash it doesn't happen
you can always say it's going to happen
well it just hasn't happened yet or you
can say oh we got lucky this is not good
but
if he gets it right he will be called
out the same way i i got it right with
trump
if i've got my trump prediction wrong in
2016
i would just go on with life right
i say well got that one wrong just go on
with life
but if you get it right it changes your
life
so
uh
kiyosaki is playing the odds really well
because the odds of a big stock market
crash eventually
are pretty good so he'll probably get
one right
and
get a lot of attention for it might be a
good thing
at least in terms of publicity a good
thing
um
so here's a here's a story on cnn that's
just sort of state of the the world
so apparently uh there was a white
student in the school it doesn't matter
where somewhere in america and he made a
what is being described as a racist
video
now i don't know the details of the
racist video so i don't know if you and
i saw we'd think it was racist but cnn
says it's racist so let's take that
assumption and go with it
anyway a black student approached that
white student who had made that
allegedly racist video
and a physical altercation occurred and
the white student was injured and needed
to be treated for head injuries
now i don't know how bad the head
injuries were
but if it's like a concussion it's a
it's a brain injury
so is it a head injury like you know
he's got a bleeding head or is it a
brain injury which would be a lot worse
i don't know
but it's worrisome
but anyway the students uh they called
for a walk out and here's what they
demanded they wanted disciplinary action
against the white student
and no disciplinary action for the black
student
who
caused the head injury with this
altercation that sound about right to
you
now what we don't know is which one of
the students started the fight
so if the black student
simply addressed the white student with
verbal complaints
and the way students started the fight
well then i'd agree right yeah
whoever started the fight is to blame
but if it worked the other way or they
sort of both started the fight which you
know with kids
with kids it's usually they both started
the fight wouldn't you say you know
there's words there's a touch there's a
push
it usually escalates at the same time
it's not like somebody walks up and
throws a punch could happen i mean maybe
but probably they're both about equally
culpable
and it feels to me without knowing the
full details of this so i could be wrong
if i heard the context
but it feels like it's another example
of violence against white males being
acceptable
would you agree
now
i'm not defending his racist alleged
video
i'm not saying that obviously
i'm saying that the way this is written
and the the student's reaction to it
feels like
you know one more little brick on that
wall
of uh it's okay to hunt
uh white males
and hurt them
so here's the more uh new some fake news
except this time it's not gavin newsom
it's hawk newsome
with an e on the end of newsom
what are the odds that two people whose
last name is actually a combination of
some news
are always creating some news
their last name is actually newsom
some news hey you want some news i got
something about hawk you want some more
news got something about gavin
how weird is that
but anyway there was some fake news
about hawk that suggested he was uh
encouraging violence
should
the new mayor eric adams
institute
reintroduce the task force there's some
kind of a police task force against gun
violence
and i guess it was disbanded and if he
reintroduces it hawke was saying
that there would be violence now the way
it was reported
was that hawk was maybe encouraging
violence or in favor of it
that actually didn't happen
he predicted it
predicting violence is perfectly
acceptable
would you would you disagree
i've predicted violence lots of times
is there any problem with predicting
violence
no
so while i don't uh back hawk newsome on
a lot of things he says
this was just fake news
all right
now
i've told you before that
don't underestimate
hawke newsome's
game
he's really clever
right and what he did here was walk
right up to the line of saying something
that would have been inappropriate you
know suggesting violence he walked up
the line but he didn't cross it
but he probably is he is i'm not i'll
take away the probably he is smart
enough to know
that phrasing it exactly the way he did
would get the most attention
while still putting him in a safe place
which is he's not recommending violence
he's just predicting it
and it's pretty clever because it worked
so
uh every time you think to yourself uh
that something that hawk newsom is doing
doesn't make sense
give it another thought
because he's operating at a pretty
sophisticated level with persuasion
all right uh
degan mcdowell tweets and uh i agree
that biden and company have
intentionally driven up the price of oil
and fuel for taking a
uh by taking a hatchet jab to her
hatchet job to our energy economy
they've intentionally and intentionally
will be the word that i'll question here
in a moment they've intentionally
created hardships for americans only
when energy prices are high do these
alternatives make sense so in other
words
dagon is saying that the biden
administration is making fossil fuels
uh too high priced
to make it easier for the you know the
green stuff to
be economical
now generally speaking and i say this
often
i reject the mind reading opinions which
is you have to be in the mind of the
other person to have that opinion
but i don't know that that applies here
because i think they're saying it
directly aren't they
you know isn't the biden administration
saying directly that they want green
energy and that they want to they want
to price carbon fuels out
i feel like that's a direct message but
they don't say it um they don't package
their message
as succinctly as uh deagon mcdowell did
uh by saying they're basically torturing
the middle class
uh to get their uh
their let's say left leaning agenda
through which is more green energy
that's what it looks like so i don't
think that was mind reading at all i
think that's that was right on
anyway uh steve bannon got indicted for
refusing to uh
testify to congress
what part of the con i assume the
constitution gives congress this power
congress has the power to demand that
you go in and
talk to them in public
the
does not does anybody know where that
law would exist
or is it a law is it a right they gave
themselves by just voting for it
if there's a constitutional scholar here
could somebody tell me
um
yeah i didn't think i didn't think
congress had any police power right
so i'm a little confused about this
story
they have subpoena power but does
subpoena power give them power to punish
you if you don't
obey the subpoena
i don't know i i'm very much in favor of
citizens uh resisting this
because it looks like a show trial to me
you know when when congress does these
things it doesn't look like the point of
it is justice does it
you know when people get subpoenaed for
the court system
i say to myself well flaws and all at
least is part of the justice process so
that's okay but this is outside of the
justice process
how do you do a show trial when you're
not part of the justice system
uh yeah i guess eric older hero eric
holder also
refused
so this is kind of an interesting case
we'll see we'll see if any uh penalty
happens to bannon i guess you could get
30 days in jail
for doing this but i definitely support
him in this
i would support him and it wouldn't
matter what his reason is
so i don't care what bannon's reason is
for not wanting to do it i feel like
every citizen should be able to refuse
this
who's with me
i don't think we should be able to
refuse talking to the you know the real
police
but i think we should be able to
refuse
this
yeah okay i think most of you agree on
that
there is a great article uh by andrew
sullivan
uh on sub stack
i tweeted it so you can find just you
can tweet andrew sullivan and look for
his articles or my my twitter feed and
here's how he uh he tweeted about his
own
this is his uh sort of summary of his
own article
he said 2016 election so see what all
these have in common what do all these
have in common before he tells you 2016
election rittenhouse
covington
russian collusion
vaccines
bounties on u.s soldiers
lab leak theory
jesse smole
the pulse shooting the atlanta shooting
hunter biden laptop inflation and the
steele dossier
what do they all have in common
fake news yes
that's one thing they have in common
what's the second thing they have in
common
one is that they're all fake news what's
the second thing they have in common
somebody says it's about white people
not quite it's not right it's not
exactly where i'm going
um it's conservative bashing that's
correct every one of these stories
favors the left's narratives every one
of them and he didn't even have a
complete list
he didn't have the fine people hoax and
he didn't have the drinking bleach oaks
i'm not sure if he knows their hoaxes
honestly because a lot of people who are
well informed don't know that these are
hoaxes
but i would have put them on the list
but but every one of these has the same
pattern to it
that it's a liberal narrative
and it's so shockingly obvious when you
see him lay out the entire context
we do not live in a country with
anything like a free press
i mean technically it's free
but the way it operates is just as a
captive of of the democrats
all right
um there was a french study that i saw
and then didn't get much attention
maybe because it disagrees with the
narrative you be the judge so i'm not
going to say this study is necessarily
highly credible
but it's worth noting so the french
study says long covid the idea that even
after you recover from covet there would
be symptoms that are ongoing
are all in your head
now
that was always a possibility right
we've seen the reports that you know up
to half of the people might have long
covered
at least 25 percent but up to half
now from day one
have i not told you from day one
it could be
all in people's heads this is exactly
what that would look like all right
if it were real or it were not real it
would look exactly like this
whether it was real or not real it would
look exactly like this
so you can't really tell based on all
the
the reports and facts and you can't tell
by asking people
so if you ask people hey did you have
any symptoms they'll say yes
but you don't know if they're accurate
that's the problem so this new study did
something clever
in which uh i'm not sure i totally
understand it but they they found a way
to do a control
allegedly
uh so let me tell you what they did they
they
uh they had a huge pile of people that
they were looking at
but only a thousand of them they ended
up looking at closely
because there were a thousand who
actually uh tested positive
and now the thousand who tested positive
for covid about 450 believe they had the
virus
so half of the people who didn't
more than half
didn't even know they had the virus
now you asked the people who definitely
have the virus and knew it
if they had symptoms
and then you asked the people who didn't
know it if they had symptoms and
apparently there's a difference
but anyway the the i'm doing a terrible
job of explaining this so if it sounds
like uh it sounds like a bad study that
has more to do with the way i'm
explaining it i think
but anyway they concluded that the
persistent physical symptoms
quote may be associated more with the
belief in having been infected
so in other words if you thought you had
been infected but you hadn't
you have the same rate of long covet as
the people who have been infected
i think that's what i'm saying
right
let me say that again
if you thought you had covered but you
didn't
you have the same experience of long
covet you report the same symptoms as
people who actually had the the thing
which would suggest there's no such
thing as long covert
i'm not convinced
and i'm not convinced for the wrong
reason
here's the worst reason to not be
convinced
anecdotal evidence
i know two people
experience with long covent as they
describe it
doesn't sound like something that could
be in your head i mean it's just too
dramatic it's like way bigger than
something that would be in your head
but
and also i believe that they found
differences in the lungs
long after you recovered
so i'm still on the side that says long
covet is probably something
but it might be a lot smaller than we
think
but probably something
yeah so doc dr drew is one who had uh
symptoms
that it would be hard to imagine that
those were imaginary
because they were they're pretty
dramatic
uh you can think if the only problem was
oh i had more headaches or something
you'd say did you i mean are you keeping
track of your headaches
you really know you had more headaches
you know that would be suspicious but
the types of symptoms are pretty
dramatic i don't think that that i would
be surprised if they're imaginary
anyway
what is the main theme of uh democrats
and the left
i think it's child abuse
and look at this list
climate alarmism
uh would you agree that the children are
being taught climate alarmism
and would you also agree that the kids
can't do anything about climate change
i mean you know greta can complain but
basically
children in general
they can't do anything
except
influence their parents
that's the play right isn't the play to
influence their parents
so
um we now have a pretty strong medical
indication
that anxiety
is being
you know definitely kicked up because of
climate alarm
all right would you agree with the the
following assertion
we do know the kids are getting really
scared and anxious about climate change
okay i think i think we all agree that
that's true
we also know that anxiety
is very strongly correlated with bad
health outcomes
so does climate change alarmism
cause children to be less healthy
yes
yeah i mean it's pretty clear
um unless i guess the only caveat would
be if adults are more sensitive to
anxiety or something maybe kids are more
resilient i doubt it
but i mean you can imagine it
so
climate change is basically child abuse
in the
at least how it's being presented to
children
uh for some larger goal you know some
goal of the left to have more green
energy i guess
uh critical race theory or let's not
call it by that name but the the things
that are embedded in curriculums
does that not just turn kids against
each other it basically labels some kids
victims and some kids oppressors
how is that good for kids
that feels like child abuse doesn't it
to to
sort them into abusers and abused
i think it's child abuse how about lack
of school choice
if you wanted your kid to get out of the
cesspool of public school you couldn't
do it
you know unless you had a lot of money
so that feels like uh some kind of
child abuse how about forced
vaccinations for kids that have almost
no chance of having a problem with covet
but we're going to vaccinate those kids
to keep adults safe
it's child abuse
it's child abuse
for the benefit of adults
um how about uh social media
we allow children to use social media
which i'm opposed to i don't think
children should be allowed to use social
media
because it's damaging
it's obviously damaging
it couldn't be more obvious
i'm not even sure adults should use uh
social media but at least we get to you
know make adult choices kids don't make
adult choices
you're giving basically you're feeding
cocaine to children
that's what it is it's like giving them
cocaine
so that's child abuse
um how about the uh written hower
prosecution
all right it was a 17 year old
who is being made a scapegoat
to feed the narratives that white people
are bad and guns are bad and whatever
else
and racism i guess even though there was
no race involved
so you know you could argue whether 17
at the time of the crime he's 18 now
or the alleged crime no crime no crime
is uh no crime is in evidence but it's
an alleged crime
um
that looks like child abuse too
so at what point do we say this pattern
is a little too obvious
right now i don't think i don't think
that there are any
people on the left saying you know what
we could do we could abuse some children
and and then we get away with this but
just like follow the money usually
predicts
follow the child abuse it seems to
predict wherever democrats are going to
go
if you said to yourself i don't know how
the democrats are going to respond to
some future
situation
just ask yourself what would be the
worst thing for children
and that will be it
is it bad for children yeah they'll do
that
i mean it's really consistent
all
right
um
i love this tweet from
michael edwards on twitter
so so i got into a conversation with
somebody who said that i'm a dumb ass
for believing that crt is taught in
schools
because crt is only a college level
class
and man am i a idiot
for thinking that any of that's in the
public school system
now
this person is a victim
the person who thinks that crt is not
being taught in schools
every day i wake up and my social media
has at least one example of written
documentation where clearly
the tenets
you know the the philosophy of crt is
embedded in the curriculum it's in
writing in lots of different places and
it's clear right they don't use the
words critical race theory they just
embed the the concepts
so somehow the left has convinced a lot
of morons that just because the name
critical race theory isn't specifically
used when they talk about schools and
high schools
that somehow that's meaningful
it's not meaningful you're just using a
different word but listen to what
michael edwards tweets and i love this
he goes
if they're
so so after the this guy said that was a
dumb ass saying there's none of this is
being taught in schools michael edwards
tweets if there is none in schools
then there's no problem banning teaching
it right
why would you be opposed to banning
something that isn't happening anyway
can we all agree on that
if critical race theory
is not being taught in schools
and that's what the left
says
then let's just ban it
and everybody wins
the left
is irrelevant because nothing would
happen
you can't ban something that's not
happening so big deal
and the right would be happy to ban it
so
we've gotta we've got a deal right
we'll all just ban it
and the left will say well that nothing
will happen
all right
american courts are saving the day
um i have i am of the opinion that the
only thing that holds america together
is the court system and that the court
system is the jewel and the crown
of the republic everything else in the
republic is a good idea
but the court system is the one
that's got to be
working
now it's full of warts of course you
know any big system has problems
but um it's the only thing that'll save
us
and i'll give you a couple of examples
apparently the biden idea to have osha
enforce vaccine mandates
got stopped by the i guess the fifth
circuit
who said it was just an insanely over
broad mandate that didn't didn't
distinguish
uh by degree of risk and it doesn't make
sense for the truck driver to have the
same
degree of risk if he's all by himself
compared to you know other types of jobs
so they
they just said oh this this is too far
they stopped it now i don't know if
that'll last but it's stopped at the
moment
likewise i think the core system is
going to save us from this written hour
situation
i think the court is going to find him
not guilty of murder
and even the prosecution has sort of
given up on their murder case and
they're introducing lesser charges
does that seem fair to you
can the court
halfway through the trial or even toward
the end of the trial can the court just
say oh oh it's not really this charge
it's a different charge
really
can they do that apparently they can
because it's being done it doesn't seem
like that would be
fair to the
uh the charged but maybe it is if it
speeds things up i don't know
but uh
once the prosecution has admitted that
they don't have a case
and there were no surprises in the in
the uh
in the trial
just think about this
i don't believe the defense
introduced any kind of surprises
so everything that was known by the
prosecution
was known before the trial is known now
which is how much evidence they have
which is none
of murder anyway
and
i i still feel like the prosecutor needs
to go to jail for that
what the prosecutor did
to kyle rittenhouse
it's not a crime technically
but boy does it need to be i mean at the
very least you need to be disbarred i
bet the least
but i don't know that any of that will
happen
still i'm glad that the court system i
think will keep kyle rittenhouse from
the the worst of the potential outcomes
um
i heard this uh factoid that is not
confirmed
because it's just in a tweet from
somebody i don't know but can anybody
confirm that this is true
that we learned just
recently that rittenhouse's dad grandma
uh aunt uncle and cousins all live in
kenosha
because a big part of the story is he
went he came to a town that he wasn't
part of
and he should have just stayed home you
know wasn't his business
so i'm seeing somebody saying that his
dad does
well let me explain how a
two
family
you know a two parent situation works
when they're separated or divorced
rittenhouse has two home towns
am i wrong
if his father's in one town and his
mother is in a neighboring town
presumably he spends a lot of time in
both he might have a bed in one and not
in the other but he has two home towns
you know the the town that you spend
your time with with your father
who lives there
is kind of your hometown too
so and and he only was 20 minutes away
so all of this business about crossing
state lines
is just
it's just
so i'm
it was
before
i knew that he had a reason to be there
that was his hometown he was protecting
he was protecting his
father's town you could say that
oh and somebody says he works in kenosha
yeah kenosha is pretty much his town
all right uh the funniest thing that
came out of this is uh there's some
photos
of some part of the trial where it looks
like the uh judge
was sitting at maybe the uh
the defendant's table to look at
some i don't know documents or a video
or something and kyle rittenhouse
not handcuffed is leaning over the
judge's shoulder
not handcuffed
leaning over the judge's shoulder
looking at stuff with him and nobody in
the courtroom
is the least bit worried
that kyle would be dangerous
he's being accused of double murder
and nobody in the courtroom
even the bailiff isn't even on the eve
isn't anywhere near him the bailiffs on
the other side of the room and an
unhandcuffed
guy charged with double murder is just
looking over the shoulder of the judge
and nobody's concerned
nobody's concerned
because there's nobody there who thinks
he's a murderer
not the defense
not the prosecution not anybody
i'm hearing i'm hearing in the comments
that robert barnes might think there's
more risk for written house because the
defense didn't do a good job or
something is that the story i don't know
the details of that but you should
follow barnes
um
saw a tweet from christian vanderbruck
talking about the issue of kyle he was
17 at the time
and christian asked us on twitter what
the hell kind of quote well-regulated
militia includes child soldiers
do you want to answer that question what
kind of well-regulated militia
well-regulated militia in quotes
includes child soldiers
do you know what the answer is all of
them
all of them
yes
every one of them
do you do you think the 15 year old
colonial boys weren't going to pick up a
gun
of course they were of course they were
17 year olds joined the military
routinely
yeah
child soldiers is the norm of course
we're gonna have child soldiers i hate
to go to war without
any imagine trying to go to war without
without any you know 17 18 year olds as
part of the process be a lot harder
apparently wisconsin has activated 500
national guard troops
do you think we would need any national
guard troops
if we were not all completely aware
that
the national media is trying to turn
this into a riot
if there's a riot it's not about kyle
is it
the riot would be whatever the the
mainstream media ginned up and it looks
like they're trying to create a little
riot here
and i wonder if activating the troops is
part of the uh risk management i hope
i hope it's just good risk management
or is it part of the proposition is it
part of the persuasion
are are we activating these troops as
part of this signal that there's going
to be a riot to make it more likely
because i would like to not know that
they were activated wouldn't you
i'd like i'd like them to be activated
but i don't want it to be in the news
necessarily
does it make it less or more likely that
they'll be riding
i don't know it feels like more like
game on you know there's going to be a
lot of action and energy
so wherever there's energy
people are attracted
and i think
if you put all these national guard
troops in there it's going to be a lot
of energy
so i'm not sure if that's going to work
exactly as they hope
but if it's you know it's probably good
risk management to do this but talking
about it maybe not so much
all right that
is pretty much
influenced the jurors yeah could
influence the jurors you're right
10 proud boys could handle it
don't get me started on on the proud
boys
you know the problem with groups like
the proud boys and and really any group
the left the right
the problem with any of these groups is
there's always going to be somebody bad
in a group
and then they will come to define the
entire group
um
russell brand coming out as a
commentator like you leaning liberal but
expresses very conservative opinions
he has four million subscribers uh yeah
uh russell brand
i hear what you're saying that he's uh
he's he leans liberal but
because he's open-minded
and he's smart
and he does seem he's on the short list
of people that i think is
immune to um
some of the biases
uh and he's got 4 million subscribers i
think he earned 4 million subscribers
i think his number of subscribers is
uh completely commensurate with the
quality of his product it's a very high
quality product if you haven't watched
it it's really good
uh also the
divorce courts yeah
he's a libertarian somebody says that
makes sense a left-leaning libertarian
uh and bill maher keeps keeps pounding
on the wake mob
as well
um
conservatives with liberal audience
where's the other way around oh good
point
yes
there there are liberal-leading people
who have conservative audiences and i
would be one of them
uh by the way let me explain this in
case in case you know anybody's new here
here's here's the way i try to brand
myself
i say i'm left of bernie
because i think the the left has better
goals
all right their their objectives are
better it's like feed everybody
you know give everybody a good chance
get rid of the bias as much as you can
you know get rid of any structural
racism that's holding anybody back i
love all that stuff
i even i even respect
when people
prefer to be called by certain terms
totally because i would like the same
right i would like to be called what i
would like to be called in my case i'd
like to be called
you know
he or
mr adams or whatever
um
so that's just you know being polite
everything can go too far of course
right everything can go too far so i
like the objectives of the left but i
don't like their tactics
and i don't think they understand human
motivation so they don't build good
systems so i like the systems and
practicality of the right because the
right never ignores
stuff that matters
the left consistently ignores
gigantic
variables
they just ignore variables such as how
people act
right or how much money there is
just gigantic variables just completely
ignored on the left so i can't embrace
the left's um
strategy because it's just nonsense
the right however has a let's say a uh
maybe a more clear-eyed and some would
say you know cold-blooded approach to
things
because those make systems work better
you know a good system is going to be a
little harsh
but it's only going to be harsh against
the people it needs to be it's not going
to be about harsh against the people who
are heading in the right direction
so i appreciate the rights systems
and i appreciate the left's you know
idealism
uh but i don't think either of them have
it right
that's my take i don't think either side
has it right
there there is clearly gigantic space
for a middle party
it would take somebody with
extraordinary persuasion to pull it off
but there is a there's an opening
and i don't think it's ever existed
before
there's an opening for a middle party
that would represent seventy percent of
the country
seventy percent of the country but the
only way to pull it off is that the
middle party would actually have to be
middle
like it couldn't be pretend middle like
everybody tries to do you know they try
to pretend they're they're appealing to
the middle but they're not
at the very least
the candidate for the middle party
would uh give you both arguments
right
that's the way i'd run it now somebody
said trump is middle
that's not too far off
it's not too far off to say trump is
middle but because it is provocative
ways he'll never be seen that way so he
doesn't work
that way he doesn't work as a middle
candidate
but the other thing that trump doesn't
do
he doesn't explain the other side
now i'm not saying that he should
because he's he's a great persuader and
just sticking to your sticking to your
points and letting the other side defend
themselves it's probably a good strategy
but if you wanted to be credible and i
think there's this gigantic thirst
for at least credibility which is
different from being right
you know people will forgive you for
being wrong
but they won't forgive you for being
wrong when you you should have done it
differently when you should have known
they won't forgive that
right so if i were the middle party i
would always tell you the other person's
argument and i would do the best job i
could of explaining it say look i'm
going to propose x
but i got to tell you y has some good
points
if you can't do that you don't deserve
the vote
i'll say that again really clearly if
you can't
argue the other team's side convincingly
you shouldn't be a politician
you don't have the capability
and i don't think you would be credible
if you can't describe the other side's
side credibly
now
on this live stream i try to do that
do i do i succeed i don't know that
would be a judgment call
um
but i do try to show the other party's
argument and the reason i do that is to
build credibility
does it work
because i know it pisses you off a lot
when you hear me even explain the other
side's point of view
but does it work overall
that when i agree with you it doesn't
feel like i'm just taken aside
yeah so i think it works it's just not
it's not a perfectly clean process some
people are just going to hate me for it
you can't you can't have a middle party
because the media is in control well if
somebody had a big enough social media
platform they could and run
as trump did in many cases they could
end run the major media
um
what about joe rogan oh you mean
well
so
joe rogan made some news
probably not the way he wanted to
how many of you know the the latest joe
rogan news
all right i wasn't going to talk about
it but i don't know
i i don't i don't think you can avoid
talking about it just
so keep in mind that joe rogan is you
know a
comedian so when he says things you
shouldn't take him a hundred percent
seriously
but apparently he said in some contexts
that he's very flexible and he's so
flexible that he can uh
let's say he can orally please himself
now first of all
i don't know that that's actually true
meaning i don't know if he's literally
that flexible
um
but you know theoretically yes
but the fact that he said it
is why he's a national treasure
you know i i keep referring to uh joe
rogan as a national treasure because i
think he is
but that's why
like
um
i i would never tell that joke because
you can't get it out of your head
you know like now it's gonna really
i think for some people it might change
the way they see him so i wouldn't have
told that joke but i love the fact that
he did
i love the fact
that he threw caution to the wind and
told that joke he had to know
you know on some level he had to know
what would what would come of that
and
i'm just hoping that he doesn't because
he's influential i'm just hoping he
doesn't cause uh uh other men to uh join
yoga classes so let me make a prediction
you ready for this
i'm gonna to make a prediction
it's based on the fact that joe rogan is
influential
uh in the sense that he has a large
platform so his platform plus the fact
that he makes news
tens of millions of americans have heard
that he's so flexible that he can please
himself
here's my prediction
you ready
mail attendance and yoga classes will go
up in the next year
anybody anybody want to take the other
side of that bet
i don't know if you we can measure such
things because i don't know if there's
any data on how many
men take yoga classes
but my prediction is
that there will be a good 10 uptick
in men joining yoga classes
i'll just leave that there
all right
uh apparently he's already got a
nickname joe blow rogan
all right
um
i'm just looking at your jokes now
i'm just going to look at the jokes
all right i'm not going to read any of
your jokes i think that's enough for
today we'll leave it on that and
thanks for joining me i hope you enjoyed
it
