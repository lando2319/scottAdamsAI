Rumble hello YouTube Hello locals hello
X we got a show for you the Saturday
show of
shows now it's my understanding
that there are a lot of podcasters who
don't do a weekend
show but not me I
[Music]
care good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
there's never been a finer time and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that only demigods and
and other awesome people can understand
all you need for that is a CER muger a
glass a tanker chaler Stein a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparallel
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous siping is
happening now
go all right
in the comments how many of you have
tried the get out trick to get out of
your own head the one I taught you the
reframe I'll just I'll just see your
answers in the comments will be a little
bit
delayed uh you'll be amazed if you
haven't tried it yet the get out
technique there it is the yeses are
coming in all right uh an coulter's
interview with me has dropped so I think
there's a clip on X but uh it's for
subst it's a substack thing I'm not sure
what access you have or not but if
you're following in cter on substack
check that
out well I uh saw some news that chat
GPT has got this great new update it's
way better than it was in many different
ways and so I thought to it to myself I
wonder if it can detect The
hoax so I asked it about the drinking
bleach hoax and it's still seems to
suggest that maybe the president was a
little unclear about what that
disinfectant was so I went to grock and
grock
is
accurate grock just tells you what
actually happened it's not a hoax so
what will happen when you have two
Advanced
intelligences they look at the same
situation and they have different
interpretations of what they see not not
just
philosophical or anything like that but
what's there on the page and what
happened in reality and they'll be
different and I believe they will be
different
forever and I think as most mostly has
to do with how it was trained um I don't
think it's an
accident all right I've got a question
for you this also comes from my
conversation the other day with Chad
GPT who uh tried to convince me well
actually this was by own AI when I was I
was arguing with my own
clone so I made a clone of myself and I
was arguing with it the other day and
one of the arguments was was January 6
an Insurrection because 1% of the people
were
violent and I say to you if January 6
was an
Insurrection because 1% of the people
were
violent what do you call the
NFL did you know that the NFL has about
1% of them get arrested every
year for something terrible you know
that's that's fairly Ser well it's bad
enough to be arrested I mean that that
tells you something now how many of you
racists just said to yourself wow those
NFL people get arrested a lot wrong the
NFL get arrested way less than the the
Normal public did you know that I didn't
know that till this morning I didn't
know one way the other but I didn't I
didn't know it was that so apparently
the general public if you looked at the
same age group not we're not talking
about anything Race So race is not part
of it but if you just took young men and
you looked at their arrest
rate apparently young men get arrested
at about 11% per
year
what did you know that if you looked at
the same age it's about 10 times more
people get arrested in the general
public in that demographic and again not
race this is just uh gender and
age it's kind of shocking but it but it
is an interesting question how many in a
group have to be bad before you can say
the group is
bad it's definitely not
1% I would say that we should all agree
that if 1% of a group is doing anything
it does not tell you much about that
group I would say you need to get it to
around
30% and then you can say start saying
okay if you join the group you know if
you voluntarily joined a group where 30%
of them are going to be doing something
terrible we cannot really say that
you're good would that be fair at about
30% if 30% of your crowd was criminals
and you willingly joined a group where
30% were
criminals could we really say you're
innocent
right or maybe you say 50% but there's
some number where you can't really say
you're innocent if you willingly join
that
group that that would be like saying
well you know somebody joined the KKK
but they were really there for the
social
reasons it does really fly right you
know once you get to 90%
bad you got to say maybe you shouldn't
have joined that group but at 1% I think
we'd all agree that's not tell tell you
much about the nature of the group in
general um Jeff Clark who's a US
attorney was under Trump and uh he is a
great follow on X except that he reports
he just had his X ad Revenue cut for no
reason um something about
a uh Bas supposed violation of a Creator
content
rules but I don't think he was doing
anything we weren't doing which is just
retweeting stuff on
X but because he's really good at it and
he's a good advocate for
Trump probably got reported more than
other people do you really think he
broke any
laws probably not I think he was just
tweeting like you know posting like
everybody else and then suddenly some
some something
happened is there anybody who has the
same worried suspicion that I do that
although I trust El on musk I don't know
if I can trust all the employees who are
still working at X do you have that
feeling I feel like there's going to be
some manipulation within X that the you
know the boss is not aware of and
certainly would not
support and it feels like maybe we're
seeing some suggestions of it already I
see a lot of people complaining that
something something seems to be
happening with their account but you
know no comp
I mean it's probably confirmation bias
if anything but I worry about it yeah I
worry about it I also say could the CIA
possibly put up with a situation in
which they don't have control of that
platform is that something they could
live with and if they couldn't do it
with the agreement of the boss and
probably they couldn't could they do it
just by making sure that they had their
own moles in the organization
seems like they could do
that so I'm not so sure that X is free
of uh
influence I I just have a like a little
suggestion a little concern about that
so we'll see if anything comes from
that but you should follow Jeff Clark on
X and uh it'd be nice if he had some way
to figure out what it was he did so he
could reverse
it so there's a video that came out as
you know of Diddy beating up his
girlfriend in the hallway of a hotel and
today we learned that he may not be uh
charged for that because it's passed the
statute of
limitations
2016 so it turns out that Diddy will
probably get away with badly abusing his
girlfriend on
camera as long as he doesn't record the
expense as a legal
expense am I right yeah as long as he
does his accounting correctly apparently
he'll get get away with beating up his
girlfriend because of the statute of
limitations do you know who uh would
have had the same situation but
didn't correct me if I'm wrong I need to
fact check in this isn't the only
reason that Trump um ended up in the
egene Carol Case is that New York
changed the statute of limitations just
for Trump now they made it look like it
was for other situations but it was
suspiciously applicable to
Trump I think that actually happened
right yeah in New York they changed the
statute of
limitations I if I have this right I
think they briefly opened a window where
people could come forward with much
older complaints beyond the statute of
limitations just for sex
crimes and everybody smart says well
that's a big coincidence because that's
exactly what they needed for EEG curl to
come after Trump oh how
coincidental and by the way do you know
she narrowed down the date of the
assault to I think it was one of these
years
so seems to me a lot of Democrats get
away with the
crimes um let's talk about Marjorie
Taylor green you all saw her uh dusted
up with AOC and the other Congress
prisoner name I can't remember Crockett
Cricket Crockett something like that and
uh of course uh we're all supposed to
act shocked and
outraged can I do some pretend to shock
and
outrage oh I hate it when the
representatives of my government act a
little bit
unprofessional in public It embarrasses
the country so much so much okay nobody
believes any of that right um I think I
probably agree with most of you that it
was fun to watch and that's my entire
feeling about it it was fun to watch and
we're
done the the funny thing is that we we
try to
imagine that if they had not been doing
what they were doing which is fighting
over
eyelashes if they had not been fighting
over eyelashes we're supposed to think
that they would have been doing
something useful for the
country
really really if they could have only
avoided that eyelash discussion we could
have paid down the national debt and
gotten out of Ukraine I don't think so
and Van Jones said that uh you know
Marjorie Taylor green has never
accomplished anything and that she's
sort of a she's she's a
clown she's a
clown to which I say
if you're working in a
circus is it wrong to be a
clown I mean if Congress were any kind
of a respected institution then I would
say h you don't want to put a clown in
respected
institution that would be like putting a
turd in a swimming pool wouldn't it am I
right yeah you don't want to see that
tsy rues swimming in your swimming pool
because it's out of
place but suppose you're swimming pool
instead of water was filled completely
with
feces nothing but feces and you added a
turd to it would is see man a place no
it would not it would not so if you add
a clown to
Congress when you watch it you say
what's going on here this seems so out
of
place when everybody else was doing the
serious business of governing there was
this this one person who seems to be
breaking the decorum my God I'm so
embarrassed for the
country we send Joe Biden to represent
us and you think I'm embarrassed about
Marjorie Taylor Green in insulting
somebody's eyelashes and what I thought
was actually kind of
funny
no read the room read the room if she's
acting like a clown it's maybe because
she read the room H look around how
should I act well clown seems
right seems like it fit
anyway how many of you have noticed that
there are three Democrats who have a
weirdly demonic look and it's the same
kind have you noticed where that when
Biden talks he Squints in an evil way so
he does evil squinty eyes but his mouth
is like smarmy fake smile evil so his
eyes are closed but his mouth is sort of
he's like he could barely suppress his
smile but his eyes are so closed because
he doesn't want to look at you what he's
lying and then Jamie Raskin and Schiff
have that same look their eyes are
closed with our camera look at Rasin
Rasin but he's got to tell you that
Donald Trump is certainly doing some
things that are bad don't look at my
eyes because my eyes are revealing that
I'm a demon don't look at them I'm going
to close them but look at my smile my
barie sky and then and then shiff so
basically shiff Rasin and
Biden they register as demons to
me don't
they when you see a face that doesn't
look like a human
face Well here here's the difference and
here's the theme that I'm getting
to when I see a republican saying
something
ridiculous I almost always think that
they believe what they're
saying and that it's just somebody's
wrong or you know got bad
information I rarely think to myself
well that person is trying to tell us
something that's not true right in front
of us and do you notice that there are
no Republicans who have that squinty
demon face
but you can find a number of De
Democrats who have it squinty demon face
look for it squinty eyes and smarmy
smile I'm so smart you all see what I
see that the president is doing things
which we think are oh just so
bad oh my God they're hard to look
at all right so my theme for today is
that
uh it seems we're in this recurring
Groundhog Day pattern where Democrats
are running organized
Ops basically gaslighting
Ops and Democrats are trying to uncover
how they did it and that's all it is all
of our politics is the Democrats ran an
op and the Republicans are trying to get
to the bottom of it there's nothing else
happening but that's the same story in
every domain what's going on there in
Ukraine maybe we should get to the
bottom of that what's happening with
uh you well you'll see the pattern well
in other news uh Buffett and Gates both
pull out large amounts of money from
Microsoft and from the market and so
some observers say wait a minute if
Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are
pulling money out of the market that
means they know something we don't but
it takes about a minute and a half
before somebody adds context on x
um you realize that's just sort of
normally what they
do so if you if you look at Microsoft
for example Microsoft has basically
doubled in the last couple years because
of AI does it make sense that Bill Gates
would take some money off the table if
one of his Investments
doubled yes that that would just be
normal normal but here's what I here's
my
speculation some smart people say that
they're expecting the market to
tank uh and then maybe has something to
do with the elections so some are saying
oh this is a indication that they think
the market is not going to keep going up
otherwise they'd have their money in the
market to which I say we don't know
where their money is going to end up if
the only thing we know is they're taking
some out we don't know where it's going
it might be in you know 5% government
instruments and they just want to write
it out if they think there's trouble but
it's such a small part of their
portfolios that it seems far more likely
they're just
rebalancing and if I were Bill Gates
what I would do is I would pull some
money out of Microsoft because that's
basically an AI company now and it
doubled and I would take some of that
money and I would spread it into robot
companies and other AI companies because
Ai and robots and maybe you know
gigawatt battery factories and stuff are
going to be everything it's just going
to be energy robots and Ai and Bitcoin I
suppose so th those are the four things
that I would want to own in in our
uncertain times I wouldn't put my whole
portfolio in them but I would say if
you're hedging you're definitely going
to want to own something in
Bitcoin um something in AI That's you
know fundamental Ai and uh something
with energy could be nukes or batteries
or something because electricity is
going to be
gigantic uh um and what else in
robots
so it would make sense that they're
rebalancing their portfolios if that's
what's happening and another
story allegedly two Jordanian Nationals
are now in custody they are not legal
citizens in this country and they tried
to allegedly breach Quantico Marine
Base and some say it was May maybe a dry
run for
Isis so is it is in Quantico the so
Quantico is the Marine base
H where is the CIA I thought that was
Quantico why why is the story called a
Marine base I guess I don't know is
Quantico the CIA or is it the Marines or
is it
both CI yeah I thought it was CIA and
Langley so Quantico is
FBI CIA I guess we don't know what it is
so I I've gotten three different answers
the the quano is FBI that is CIA and
that is Marines is it all three could it
be all
three anyway so we'll keep an eye on
that but the question is how many
terrorists do you think are already in
the
country I have a book coming out in a
few weeks I'll tell you more about it
that's uh republication of God's debris
in the religion war and new shorter
story it's all going to be in one book
I'll let you know when that's ready to
go but uh it'll be just in a few
days but a big part of the religion war
was that the way the terrorists get even
with the United States is by embedding
terrorists and all of our population
centers and activating them at the same
time
and I'm real concerned that that may be
exactly what's happening because of her
open border that China and maybe Iran
and who knows who else maybe Isis have
put enough people into our country
because you really only need one or two
per City and you know the amount of
damage they could do would be
incalculable
so if if you are fighting a battle where
it's really imbalan
you know one has the biggest military in
the world and the other
doesn't you would make up for that by
putting terrorists in all the key places
and having them activate at the same
time so my concern is that they're going
to activate at the same time sometime in
the future that's the big I I'm less
worried about the oneof just because the
odds of you know me being there
personally are pretty low but the odds
of everybody doing everything at the
same
time uh is really scary
that that one's a big
one all right um Ted Lou is at some
public hearing was saying that Trump
needs to be looked into because he he's
falling asleep in court so it might be
an might be a sign that he's not uh
healthy because he keeps falling asleep
in court now I'm no Dr tedl but uh I'm
going to diagnose uh Trump without even
seeing him
watch this it's called
boredom do you think there's any chance
I could stay awake every day sitting in
a court case even even if my life was on
the line
no it's the most boring thing you could
ever do I'm pretty sure I fell asleep
when I was doing jury duty I mean not
for long but I probably dozed off and uh
I was in my 20s when I was doing that so
yeah there's no problem with him falling
asleep during a court case in fact he
should sleep through all of it it's a
waste of time he should be well rested
and uh some other people have mentioned
this as well but do you think that the
maybe the biggest story is going to be
that uh resting Trump which is what the
trial does it rests
him might be the very worst thing they
could have done because if he were if
you were going to show any age related
issues
it would be from doing too much not from
sitting in a court doing nothing right
so a well-rested trump is the most
dangerous thing in the world to a
Democrat I mean politically not
physically but uh politically he's the
most dangerous when he's rested and
they're resting
him I feel like they figured they figur
the worst possible thing they could do
for
themselves all right
um uh Trump said he's going to demand
that Joe Biden take a drug test for the
debate because he says Biden was quote
high as a kite during the state of the
union now I for entertainment I watched
MSNBC last night so you don't have to on
MSNBC I swear to God this is the
conversation that happen they're
having now just just try to hold in your
head what you believe reality is and now
I'm going to tell you what MSNBC was
discussing and they were discussing it
like it's obvious like it's an obvious
truth are you
ready they say it's an obvious
truth that Trump will never
debate and he's only going to look for
an excuse to pull
out in in what reality does Trump run
away from an audience
how in the world does more than one
person on MSNBC sit in the same in same
conversation and say oh yeah yeah it's
pretty obvious he's not even going to be
in the debate it it looks like he's just
looking for excuses to get
out do you think this is one of them do
you think he says if they don't uh if
they don't drug test Biden he won't do
the debate of course he'll do the debate
because it's going to be even better if
Biden is high
can you imagine Trump calling out uh
Biden as being high at the
moment like well Joe you're fairly
coherent today what' they give
you well why are you saying that no
seriously Joe what did they give you
what are you on tell the public right
now no there is nothing that's going to
keep Trump away from a crowd to imagine
the the snbc people I honestly don't
know if they're dishonest or they have
dementia that might be the least real
take of all takes that Trump would avoid
a big audience where the other person
there is
Biden do you think that Trump has any
doubt any doubt
whatsoever that uh he would Prevail in a
debate at this point of course not
do you know what else I
heard that if
uh if Trump wants to debate it must be
because he knows he's in
trouble
what what how high do you have to be to
think
that as he's adding all the polls and
everything looks good so Trump has uh
doubled down and he's agreed to four
debates now I believe only two have been
offered but Trump independently has said
yes to Fox News
and um NBC and telmundo
interestingly when I wrote down my own
notes I wrote down NPC instead of
NBC but NPC might be a little closer it
might
be
um MSNBC saying Trump is afraid to
debate in cancel at the same time that
he's offered four
debates
now do you think it makes sense for
Trump to offer four
debates of course it's exactly the right
thing to do because he's gonna he's
trying to force Biden to say no to at
least one
debate so he he's basically saying I'll
take any debate anywhere you name it as
soon as Biden offered the two debates uh
Trump accepted immediately and now he's
he's calling his bluff and he's you know
increasing him two debates I'll tell you
what Trump what Biden doesn't want is
two more debates he definitely doesn't
want that so it's again it's
perfect I I feel like I'm the only one
saying
this which is the dog not barking in
this campaign is that Trump's campaign
has been perfect I've never seen anybody
H so 20 notes correctly in a row in a
campaign it's crazy he is doing so so
well and I think he's his
advisers you know to his own credit he
must be taking good advice but also has
he has good instincts but he must be
getting great
advice he because he's just killing it
like it's just a flawless flawless
campaign I mean given the limitations of
the core stuff is he's just playing it
perfectly well Andrew McCarthy says that
a hung jury in the Stormy Daniels trial
would be a victory because it's unlikely
that they'd be crazy enough to try to do
it again what do you think of the
odds um what do you think of the
odds that there's at least one human
male on the jury who is willing to uh
Buck the crowd and hang the jury I I say
almost
certain I feel like it's closer to a
certain now if he did get convicted I'm
pretty sure it would get
overturned but I think there's going to
be at least one male who says nope nope
this ends here do you know why I say
male because it's
dangerous and when there's danger there
more likely a man is going to do it than
a woman so imagine sitting in a jury
where let's say hypothetically 10 or 11
people are Trump haters and all they
want is to do is convict them and
they're like guilty don't even want to
discuss it could you be the one who says
no now it wouldn't be physically
dangerous while you're in that room but
it would get pretty intimidating it
would get pretty hot and when you left
the room people would find out you're
the one that hung the
jury that's dangerous it's dangerous men
can do that I would do it I'd do it in a
heartbeat it it wouldn't even hesitate I
I would I would hang that jury so
fast and I would do it without any
regret second thoughts I wouldn't even
have fear because once something is so
right my fear goes away I don't know if
he had this but fear is only there until
you're sure you're
right once you're sure you're right it's
still dangerous but your fear goes away
have you ever have you had that
experience
like let let's say you know you're
afraid of getting in a fight with
somebody but after they do the first
Bunch your fear just
disappears because now it's just
on yeah the fear is just when you're not
sure what's going to happen once you're
sure what's going to happen it's just go
time and I I think there's going to be
at least one juror who says you know
what it's go
time I I think it's go
time so I'm going to
bet uh I'm going to tell you that I've
not lost complete faith in human
beings I I'm going to bet on at least
one human being saying too
far too far this is too far and it stops
now and there's nothing you can do to me
I'm stopping this jury right now I think
it's going to happen I say hung
jury all right uh representative
comr he's got this story about some kind
of deleted emails uh there's some kind
of written indication that fouchy and
his friends had figured out some way to
make emails disappear after there had
been a foyer request but before they had
executed it somehow quote who said this
I don't know I learned from our NIH Foya
lady how to make emails disappear after
I am foed but before the search starts
so I think we're all safe plus I deleted
most of those earlier
emails
what what so this was you about some of
the pandemic stuff I I think that's a
quote of fouchy but if not it's you know
one of the people involved in the in the
whole business now remember my
theme my theme is a whole bunch of bad
behavior often Democrats and then
Republicans are just trying to figure
out how they did it
this is it just all over the place it's
Democrats running
Ops
and Republicans tried to undo the
Ops um even Bill m i show last night is
saying that the only reason for the June
debate which is months earlier than
normal is so they can replace
Biden
now everybody sees it at this point
Republicans see it
Democrats see
it imagine having your
own uh candidate so weak that you're
having an early debate so that you can
increase the chances of of replacing
them and that's your best guy the best
candidate so your best candidate is one
that you hope to God you can replace
really early we all see it we all see
it the amuse accountant X asks this
question is it weird that the Biden
family's Banks filed more than
170 suspicious activity reports with
authorities but the FBI never bothered
to investigate why they kept getting
suspicious wires why the bidens kept
getting suspicious wires from China
Ukraine Russia and
Romania and the claim is that there's
over uh like a quarter of a million
dollars in checks that were directly
wired to Biden with no explanation
do you think that's a coincidence no
this is more to my
theme
of Democrats are running Ops and the
Republicans are just trying to figure
out what's going on here how' you do
this up it's everything
from you know the major hoaxes you know
the Russia collusion it's all the same
it's just Democrats running
hoaxes Republicans trying to unwind them
it's our entire system
now all right according to CNN the black
vote for Trump which was only 9% in 2020
looks to be according to polling up to
22% in
2024
22% now that's still way less than half
so it's nothing to brag about but
clearly something's happening now what's
missing in the
story what's missing in the story that
black vote has more than doubled since
2020 well what's missing in the story is
the part that Frank luns is the only one
willing to say out loud besides
me he says that uh Trump could win the
votes of onethird of black men under age
40 they identify with Trump he
says it could be as high as one-third of
black men under 40 it's men
it's not black people it's mostly men is
that a coincidence no because men are
rising because there's there is an evil
and we sense
it let me ask you this men men who are
watching this right now don't you
sense that there's an evil which you are
personally responsible for because we're
sort of Born to take care of this stuff
doesn't feel personal like I feel like
there's a level of evil that's trying to
creep into our system and that men
specifically need to stop it because I
think women for whatever reason are on
the side of the
evil doesn't mean they're evil but they
seem at least accidentally on the
side so at least Frank Lun is telling us
the truth thank you Frank at least
putting it in the right
frame um
probably not a coincidence that
President Trump or ex-president Trump
has just announced he's going to do a
rally in South
Bronx now I don't know much about South
Bronx but what is the what's the
demographic there is that now dominant
Hispanic or is it dominant black or is
it mostly Black and Hispanic but
whatever it is it's not considered his
normal uh
stronghold but what if he kills it in
the
Bronx If he if he kills it in the Bronx
and he might you
might that's really going to change the
frame isn't
it the level of confidence that that
shows is really
infectious don't you love to watch Trump
walk toward
trouble it's my favorite thing I want to
see him meet Kim Jun I want to see him
meet p I want to see him meet she and I
want him to do a rally in the
Bronx yeah go go right into your hardest
your hardest neighborhood make it work
see if you can now I'm going to call
this the Andre Agy
strategy you you know Andre Agy famous
tennis player and he had a strategy that
if he played a player let's say who had
a strong
forehand but their back end wasn't as
strong the normal way people play that
is they would hit to the the person's
back end all day long because that's
their weaker shot Andre Agassi was so
strong as a player he would go after
their best shot and the reason is if he
could uh take a chunk out of their best
shot it would destroy their confidence
and the entire the entire uh basically
they'd collapse if you go after their
weak shot they expect it and they also
get better at better at hitting it
during the game because you're literally
giving them practice at their week his
shot so they you know they have a chance
of playing their way into it but if you
go after their best shot and the other
team and the other person knows they're
doing it and they say wait a minute
you're hitting to my
forehand that's crazy ho you just
made the point okay but this won't work
you're still H hitting to my best shot
how did you win that game and then
you're
done Trump is hitting to Biden's Best
Shot
he's going into the Bronx in the in the
same city that is so
anti-trump that they decided that's the
best place to laware of so I'll tell you
what this reminds me of is that the
remember when Obama was at the uh was at
the network Correspondence Dinner the
famous thing where they try to tell
jokes and they all
fail and he humiliated Trump in the
audience because Trump had done the
birther thing by then and then Trump's
response was to take the
presidency now we have a similar
situation where New York the state is
saying we hate you so much we're going
to try you here the worst place we can
do it for you and we're going to put you
in jail because New York is the place
you go to
die and Trump
says I'm going to take the
Bronx how perfect is
that my God
that is so perfect that I I can't even
express words in terms of
strategy going after going after Biden's
strong his strength is just so gutsy and
when you see a leader go after
somebody's strength because they're so
confident they think they can take an
his forehand Andre Agy style oh my
God who who doesn't want to watch that
no matter what happens the energy
monster is is uh is doing his thing
energy
monster so that is whatever event it was
last night I think uh Trump pulled out
some Tic Tacs you know the little
candies and apparently Tic Tac now has a
extra small size container with fewer
Tic Tacs so we're where uh and I guess
he had asked for a Tic Tac and somebody
gave it to him now he he says he's going
to carry it with him to useing the rally
because it's so hilariously
small now you might say to me but
Scott Biden himself is saying that his
candy is too small so isn't Trump just
agreeing with with Biden and saying oh
these corporations are evil they're
shrinking it no Trump plays it the right
way he says it's it's a Joe Biden's Tic
Tacs because their the inflation made
them
smaller thank you he just went after
Biden's strongest claim on the economy
that the real problem is the
corporations shrinking their packaging
which is the dumbest thing anybody ever
said so Trump instead of avoiding
it holds up the tiny
candy that President small candy had
been complaining about and he says
here's your Biden inflation and I'm
looking at him holding up that tiny
candy and calling it Biden inflation and
what was my first thought
build the
wall it's
visual it's visual if he can hold up
that tiny Tic Tac thing you know the
little container every time and say here
here's uh here's what Biden gives you
here's your Biden inflation right here
and he makes the inflation
visual he said he's going to keep it
with him for the you know other events
that is exactly right every single time
reach into your PO pocket and say have
you heard of Biden's inflation look what
he did to the Tic
Tacs perfect
perfect all right
um I saw a uh awardwinning journalist
Alex
Newman he was on a show with Josh
Phillip I guess Crossroads is the name
of the show podcast I I think podcasty
kind of a show I don't know too much
about it but anyway Alex Newman was
saying that there are three new
peer-reviewed papers published in major
journals scientific journals that
basically say climate change alarm is
 one of the studies says that
40% of the warming can be explained by
the heat island effect and the rest of
it by something called the
Sun and that's a peer-reviewed current
paper in a major journal now
uh to be fair I tell you all the time
that the odds of any paper being
published and peer-reviewed and being
true is less than half so there are
three of them so that you know you might
imagine that increases your chances but
each of them is only a half 50%
chance so what are the odds wait do the
odds for me I don't want to be like uh
Andrew huberman you've
got three three
papers and all of them are the same
direction saying that climate change is
overdone and but there's only a let's
say there's a 50% chance of each one
what are the
odds then that at least one of the
papers is
accurate if it's a 50/50 and you don't
know
anything we're not good at statistics
are we I was kind of curious if
everybody would have the same answer or
if we'd be all over the place
12 a half% unless it's correlated that
sounds like the right
answer from uh yeah jym
engineer I'm going to go with the
engineer on this 12 and a half% I'm
seeing more often than not so uh H
unless they're
correlated would they be correlated
there's no reason they would be I guess
except they're looking at the same topic
that's kind of correlation I don't know
all right all the smart people are
saying
12.5 110% somebody
say so we can't believe the new studies
but uh here's my larger theme I do think
that Trump is going to have the greatest
third Act of all time I do believe that
climate change has been
debunked
sufficiently that even Democrats are
having some doubt do you think that's
true the only way the AI is going to
have happen is with massive increase in
energy and you most of that will be
green iose as much as possible so we'll
we'll be doing going hog wild with
nuclear for sure I think that's
guaranteed at this
point anyway I don't know if this means
that climate change is really debunked
it's too early to say that but uh if
there is a study that says 40% of the
warming is from the heat island effect
fact meaning that the thermometer ERS
were put in places that later cities
grew toward and where there there's a
city is hotter because of the concrete
which does not tell you that the world
is hotter just the concrete is
hotter
um totalitarian Roots okay
now apparently there's somebody named
Bill Maguire you know a green person who
says directly the only way that we'll
get to uh sustainable Planet as if
there's something like a big pandemic
that W wipes out a lot of
people and I used to say well those are
just the crazy you know ex extremists
they don't represent the public in any
way but here's the thing I
wonder you ever wonder why we're doing
gain of
function now there's a story that the
bird flu might be a gain of function
escape to
virus of course
did did anybody ever tell you why we do
gain of
function I mean I think the I believe
the official story the official story is
that it's so we're ready in case
somebody else makes a super virus but
that feels weird because can you really
guess how they'll make their virus can
you really do re you know gain a
function so specifically that you know
exactly how the bad guys are going to
try to get with a virus that feels like
a stretch given all the zillions of ways
a virus could be changed and express
itself but you know what would make
sense is if it were done intentionally
toh depopulate the
Earth and I'm not going to make that
claim but I have this
question if you apply to do gain of
function
experiments and you're applying for the
job at the lab and you're in your
interview don't you think one of the
questions should be do you think that
the population of Earth is too
high if you're not asking that I don't
want anybody near a virus that
can wipe out the
world can we at least ask the question
do you believe the biggest problem is
too many people or like Elon Musk and
like me think that the biggest problem
is the lack of a birth rate
replacement if somebody says I'd like to
work on deadly new viruses that I'll
create that could destroy humanity and
by the way I think there are too many
people I don't want that person near a
lab and do you think they ask that
question no way because nobody does
right but please
please and by the way if somebody's
already in the job I would ask them the
question again do you think there are
too many people or too few if they say
too many you got to fire them and walk
them out of the building I don't want
anybody working on gain of function who
thinks there are too many people
can we get that right can can we do that
one thing just make sure the people who
are developing deadly uh Humanity
destroying tools don't want fewer people
it doesn't seem like a lot to ask but
bet has never been
asked all
right
uh so the uh the Democrats are trying to
sell us on uh the fact that all the
major Republicans who are attending the
lawfare thing in New York It's really
because they want to kiss the Ring of
Donald
Trump and and they have to go into their
demons SMY voices you should see Adam
shiff and ask and talking about it with
her I'll do my impression squinty demon
eyes followed by SMY mouth and and the
only reason the only reason they're
going is to Kiss the Ring oh Kiss the
Ring it's like they're all
Gollum anyway comes off as a demonic
possession but can't be
sure um everybody still talking about
that Harrison bucker speech the football
kicker who did the speech at the um at
the Catholic
school so even Bill moris said I don't
see what the big crime is and he was
reminding his Democrat audience that
this is half the country you know they
they get to have an opinion about the
right way to live which I appreciate you
know he's not saying that he agrees with
it per se but just it's normal and you
should be able to talk about normal
things right you should be able to talk
about normal
things but I did watch MSNBC as I
said and one of the things they said was
that um and I didn't hear this when I
was watching right leaning news I did
not hear this at all but apparently
there was a uh comment
about uh gay people being what word did
he use
yeah so he he definitely said some
anti-gay
stuff to me that's different that's a
different category from saying some
women might want to be you know
Homemakers and some might want to go to
work that's just talking about did he
call them deviant was that the
word now that's too
far
yeah yeah I think that's too far going
after individuals but saying that women
could have choices and they could be you
know they could be any relationship they
want with their husband that seems fair
um
but if he was going
anti-gay or calling them deviants to me
that would be too far but I also think
he has free speech so you're right all
right I I would find that distasteful
but not illegal
all right I finally figured out the
situation with the debt
crisis not in terms of a solution but
here's what I couldn't understand I
couldn't understand why people are not
more panicked about it but I finally
figured it out because every time I
brought it up people would say things
like oh we'll just do what Argentina
does and cut
expenses or if he just cut x% from the
budget every year you'd be fine or if
you stop giving money to other countries
will be fine or if you do what V says
and do a major cut of the government
itself get rid of a lot of departments
you'll be
fine here's what I finally figured
out a trillion is such a big number that
we can't tell the difference between 1
trillion and 35
trillion all of those things I just said
were perfectly good plans when the debt
was one
trillion we probably could have worked
our way out by spending less and making
sure the GDP grows and a little bit of
inflation and time and you know maybe we
could have grown our way out but at 35
trillion none of those things work and I
was
suspecting that the real problem here is
that people are bad at
math so I think the reason that we're
treating it like it's not a problem the
public
you know there's some small number of
people who just harp on it all the time
like me but most of the public kind of
thinks that things will get worse and
worse and worse and then the Congress
will be forced to act but once they act
they'll fix
it that's not where we
are yeah I think you're reading the
situation wrong it is now so big it's
unsolvable there's no normal thing you
can do to solve it you can't grow your
way out of it you can't have like better
economy and just pay it off you can't
inflate your way out of it without
destroying the country at the same time
and you can't cut expenses enough to
make any difference at
all and I don't think people know
because there're still living in a one
trillion world not a 35 trillion with a
trillion added every 100 days and I
think that it's just a basic inability
to grasp math at the say conceptual
level they can't tell the difference
between a trillion and 35 trillion and
their leaders are not acting so panicked
if you turn on see an end today they
won't even mention it will they it won't
even be in the news but it's our only
existential problem the rest unless
there's a meteor coming uh the rest we
can totally work on you know War
probably won't kill us the the coming
robots will probably figure it out right
AI I think will be okay climate change
was never really
worried but the debt 35 trillion plus a
trillion every hundred days I have no
idea how you'd fix that not even a
guess but I will say
this there is some chance that our
leaders are completely aware this is
unfixable because they act like it
doesn't need to be fixed they can just
keep throwing massive amounts of money
at anything because they'll never have
to pay it back it might be that they
know they're never going to pay it back
they might know that it could be that
they think everything's going to fall
off the ledge maybe I don't think that's
what it is but more likely and I hate to
be a conspiracy
theorist but what does it push you
toward
inescapably what is it we're going to
have to do no doubt about
it digital Curr
there's no way around it because we're
going to have to do a one Once In A
History uh reset reboot I don't want to
use reset let's say reboot of the entire
Financial system in the United States at
some point cash is going to become
useless they're going to have to Value
it down to zero in the short run the
digital currency and the cash will both
have value but the cash will continue to
you know
deflate and so there's going to be a big
rush to get out of your cash that's
going down to zero and into your digital
currency that might be backed by
something may be backed by the military
or robots or I don't know something so
it seems to me that since digital
currency could be
artificial you could just say on day one
uh I magically create um $50 trillion in
money
and if you'd like to have digital
instead of money we'll just trade it one
for one you don't lose anything so if
you've got a million dollars if you're
lucky enough to have a million you can
just trade it and you'll have a million
dollars of digital money now of course
the government then has full control of
you because they can see everything you
do and stop it IM immediately If It's
All Digital so it gives the the
government gigantic power over the of
the public not ideal so I think the
public would maybe not vote for a
digital currency or oppose it unless it
was a emergency and there was no choice
and I think the emergency is going to
look like this there'll be a one-time
movement into I don't know Bitcoin or
something digital currency and that
they'll just artificially make money and
pay off the debt and they'll say to
let's say Chinese Bond holders they'll
say money is going to be worthless but
if you act now we'll convert that into
digital currency and you'll be fully
paid you just have to live with digital
currency instead of the US dollar the
normal US
dollar so I put that out there because I
don't see people suggesting how we could
survive so I think it would have to be
something so big and so radical that
it's really a rethinking of the entire
Financial system now there's probably a
way to maintain the wealth that people
have because the important people people
want to do
that
yeah do we have a digital currency now
well not a government-backed digital
currency wipe out what we owe to China
because of
Co so the trouble with all of the uh get
rid of the debt
issues if you ever cancel that much debt
then you can never do business again
because nobody's going to want to hold
your D if you can just cancel
it so that doesn't work either anyway I
think that's the problem is that we
can't understand what a trillion is
ladies and
gentlemen this concludes my prepared
remarks is ready any topic that uh
you're dying to hear me talk about that
I haven't talked
about Boomers ruined the
world do you do you know what the Boomer
said
uh so I'm a
boomer uh I said the greatest Generation
ruined the
world do you know what the people who
come after you are going to
say they're going to say you ruined the
world yeah I talked about
Diddy uh Australia seems to be lost so
Mike Ben says that the way America is
controlled now is since the CIA is not
allowed to operate directly
uh domestically that we just work with
our partners overseas and all of the
American companies that are
international have to do what the
International Community say and they
basically just back door it he calls it
the boomerang method so instead of just
fixing things directly in the United
States you send the boomerang over to
Europe Europe tells let's say x that
they have to ban these people uh or else
they can't have any business in Europe
so uh we are of course losing our
whatever this was we we're not really a
democracy SL Republic we are a criminal
organization and I would advise you to
figure out how to thrive in a criminal
organization because that's what we are
we just seem to be better at it than
other countries at the
moment
yeah uh what would the wealthy Ames
behind the global Banks want well that's
my point I don't expect the dollar to
turn into nothing in some fast way
because the rich people don't want it to
happen and I think they can prevent it
so it's going to have to be some major
major big play and by the way name any
president besides Trump who could pull
off a major Financial
reorganization I think he's the only one
because he's mentally flexible enough he
would understand the the stakes I mean
Biden can't do it Biden can barely get
home at
night all right
um by
land that's not a bad idea Yeah by land
is not a bad idea at least you're safe
from inflation a little
bit all right uh ladies and gentlemen uh
I'm going to say goodbye to uh you and
Rumble and X going to spend some time
with my beloved subscribers on locals
where you should be subscribing to if
you want the good stuff but I'll see you
