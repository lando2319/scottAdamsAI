[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened
it's called coffee with scott evans
and i won't always look like this not
always
but i'm preparing
you know what i'm preparing for that's
right
my joe biden impression it's coming up
it's coming up and it's coming in strong
but before we do that
let me remind you
in case some of you are not aware of
what's happening right now
right now
you have just
either by your own design and clever
machinations
or possibly by blind luck
you've all ended up at the best place in
the world
it's it right here coffee with scott
adams the best thing that's ever
happened to you in your entire life and
the only way you could possibly make it
better
is through the simultaneous sip
what do you need for that all you need
is a cuppa margarita glass of tanker
tell us to find a canteen jog flask
castle of any kind vessel vessel vessel
vessel vessel of any kind
fill with your favorite look and i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
really unparalleled the dopamine of the
day the thing that makes everything
better including your antibodies
go
boop boop antibodies coming online
yep 100
participation
every antibody
in my body
is on fire
well i don't know if any of you saw the
town hall last night
anybody see any clips from the town hall
well
the most notable thing that came out of
the town hall with joe biden on cnn
is that for reasons that we still don't
understand
joe biden was standing
if you haven't seen it you have to see
it for some reason he was just standing
like this
for an extended period of time waiting
for a question
now clearly
this caused people
to have uh
create many memes
among the memes of course cornholio if
you haven't seen cornholio
uh by far that was my favorite
but
i also added uh that he was holding two
ice cream cones invisible ice cream
cones
and it only took about 30 minutes for
somebody to make the video version
of him actually holding ice cream cones
we've seen them we had jet packs
we've seen them with ski poles
it's the most meme thing i've ever seen
instantly
but i would like to add to that
i think he was also sending a message
to the public
you know how
prisoners of war
will sometimes try to send a secret
message if they have to do a video
from their captors
they'll try to send something
here's the message i was getting from
this
they have me tied to a chair when i'm
not on camera
they tied me to a chair
right this is what it looked like if you
were tied to a chair
i think he was trying to tell us
he was tied to a chair
uh maybe it's parkinson's tremors
somebody says i didn't see anything like
that but it's sort of a mystery
but
as i watched it
i imagined
joe biden asking his staff how it went
and so i would like to give you a play
in one act
of joe biden asking his staff
how it went
for the joe biden role
i will dress like this
and i'll take this off for the role of
his staff member
hey everybody
how do you think i did on the town hall
was it pretty good
and what are the polls saying
i think i nailed it
the new staff member
saying well
he didn't exactly nail it
some people are making some comparisons
of
your performance
to other notable figures
other notable figures
that sounds good
are they comparing my oration to winston
churchill
[Music]
no
no
not winston churchill so much i haven't
heard that reference actually
[Music]
is it sort of a ronald reagan thing are
they saying i was inspirational
no no not ronald reagan and not winston
churchill so much no have not heard
either of those names being mentioned
actually
well who was it
who are they mentioning
have you heard of beavis and butthead
[Music]
yes
i don't think i like where this is
heading
one word
cornholio
now
seen
now i haven't watched a lot of town
halls in my life
and i haven't seen every president's
performance
but there is one thing i can tell you
with grey certainty
if you ever give a speech
and a hundred percent of the public is
comparing you to
cornholio
you didn't nail it
nope
needs work
needs work
no cornholio references
next time
you can work on that
well what else did he say uh
cnn put their spin on it of course
and they sent their uh their attack dog
stephen collinson to write about it now
stephan coulson is uh
most notable i think
for his continuous anti-trump articles
on cnn
but he's also being forced to sort of
support biden it looks like
looks like his orders are to say good
things about biden if he can
but it was kind of hard
yeah that'd be normal
it was kind of hard last night but he
did his best and stefan collinson is a
he's a soldier
he's not going to back off
when he can say something good about joe
biden so here's how he started his
article today
talking about the town hall he said joe
biden showing candor and good humor on
thursday
reminded america why i picked him as
president in a dark hour of crisis
that's pretty much how you would have
summarized it wouldn't you
if you watched that town hall you'd say
to yourself you know
my first sentence in the article should
be the one that that captures the
essence of it
was the essence that you saw that his
candor and good humor
reminded you of why you picked him as
president in the dark hour of crisis
did it remind you of that or did it
remind you of
this
which one did it remind you of a little
bit more
how good you feel
in your dark hour of crisis
i feel pretty good in my dark hour of
crisis
how about you
so
not his best performance but stephan
golisan to his credit
to his credit
he did say that there were some issues
with the town hall
he said that biden also showed his
tendency to send his own white house
into emergency damage control
as he flipped set in stone policy off
the cuff
and offered gaping openings for his
republican foes
well that's fairly generic
so you probably need a specific
let me give you a specific
in a two-person act
that involves joe biden
again
talking to his white house staff
um i'll i'll start with anderson cooper
uh manderson cooper
um have you considered using the
national guard
to alleviate
the supply chain problems
absolutely
absolutely we're looking at the national
guard
to fix our supply chain problems
and now
white house staff
we are definitely not looking
at the national guard
for the supply chain
by the way
they don't work for the federal
government they kind of work for the
governors and the state and
nope nope nothing like that
now what did that little exchange tell
you
about who's in charge of fixing the
supply chain problem
so who's in charge of fixing it
clearly
nobody
clearly nobody
because biden didn't even know that they
weren't talking about using the national
guard
if he doesn't even know whose decision
it is or what they're even talking about
seriously
he's not in charge
and we haven't heard that anybody else
is in charge we heard that you know
buddha judge is having a good time with
his kid and and i wish him well on that
by the way
but we are sort of leaderless aren't we
a little bit leaderless
and i don't think we can ignore that
anymore so
peter ducey let's ask some questions to
jen saki and see what's happening here
in terms of who is in control
of this supply chain problem
all right let's talk about the supply
chain adam dopamine on twitter
floated a suggestion i think probably
some of us had thought about it but
considered it impractical
but just for fun
how impractical is it and the idea is
this
to create a let's say an armada of
pickup trucks
to help unload the
the ports
now i know i know as soon as i said that
you said uh i got five problems that
will stop that from happening right away
you know one of the problems might be
your regulatory or insurance or whatever
but remember it's a crisis
in a crisis you can just wipe all that
stuff away
you could just say all right the the
government will insure it
and forget about your regulations your
truck is fine
so if the problem is regulations or
insurance
that's something a competent government
could solve the same day
right
but let's talk about the logistics of it
i asked how many pickup trucks you need
to unload one container
the answers i got ranged from 33 to 12
and both of those answers came from
people who seem to have experience doing
that
but
um so somewhere between 12 and 33 pick
up trucks per container but let's take
the average 20.
again
i'm not saying this is a workable idea
we're just working through it to see how
crazy it
is so suppose you allowed individual
pickup trucks to take
you know a load of peace could you ever
do the logistics
could you ever do the logistics
in other words because yet could you
ever track whether the person who took
it really delivered it
maybe
maybe and i don't know the answer to
this question but
let's say that you had a standard that
each pickup truck was only loaded with
destination
so one destination for one truck to keep
it simple
you load up the truck
and then you have the
the driver of the truck show you his
license for the truck
the full truck with the license plate
and the driver's face
you just take a picture
boop
and you send that to the the end
customer and say this person is bringing
this truck
with these items
if it doesn't show up
you know who took it
[Laughter]
or you know what the problem is and if
it doesn't show up talk to the
government at this phone number because
you have an insurance claim
now the whoever receives it should
probably take a picture of the truck too
in case the the load looks different or
reduced on the on the way
but i think
you could probably get something like
a process going would just take a
picture of it
that would be not so bad because you
don't need to enter a lot of data if you
just take a picture
you've got the license plate you've got
their license you've got their face and
you've got the truck to show the
evidence
so could you make the pro the the
paperwork
short and easy
maybe
maybe it would depend on what the mix of
stuff is now somebody said but wait
scott
you couldn't load large items on a
pickup truck so some items would be
larger than even one item you could put
on the truck
to which i say
you don't do those
that's the solution
don't do those
just leave them for the cranes and the
regular trucks because there's still
enough of those
if you can take the burden away from the
small stuff you know the smaller items
you would have enough capacity for the
big stuff so you don't need to worry
that some stuff is too big for a truck
okay
uh fruit yeah and frozen items as well
you do the specialty trucks for those
but if you're just getting rid of the
excess
stuff you could do it with the smaller
items that you could
break up and put on a truck
all right how about
would you need to load them with cranes
the pickup trucks
which then would be using up a lot of
cranes so that seems like it would be
another problem or would it be smaller
items that you could load
now somebody sent me an estimate that
said it would take
yes this is not my talent stack you're
right
so somebody said it would take an hour
to load uh
the equivalent of a pickup truck
but i don't think an hour applies if you
pick the truck if you back the truck
right up to the container
am i right
how long would it take to load a truck
if you literally just backed it up right
to the container so you've got people in
the container handing it to you and
you're just putting it on your truck
10 minutes
i think 10 minutes
if somebody's handing it to you while
you're on the bed of your truck and all
you're doing is turning around and
stacking it i think 10 minutes
right
so you so you can load it in 10 minutes
what about paying all the labor
well the labor is the the truck driver
so the truck driver charges
something that would cover the labor as
well as the gas as well as the driving
time
so there's some free market rate
that would get the drivers to do the
labor
as well as
as well as
you know driving
are there enough trucks
are there enough trucks
don't know
but there might be enough just to take
the edge off
suppose you could take
10 percent off the
off the congestion
what percentage would you have to take
from the congestion
to make it start moving somewhat
smoothly because it's not 50
you don't have to do 50 percent of the
load
probably closer to 10
right i mean just if you've lived in the
world long enough and you kind of
conceive what it would take to make a
traffic jam
think of what think of what
stops traffic in the real world on a
highway
what is it that causes a traffic problem
usually one accident
so you don't have to fix all of the
traffic to make traffic flow freely you
just gotta get rid of the ten percent
that's causing the problem you know the
last ten percent
might be twenty percent maybe it's 30.
but there's some number that um we could
work toward
to at least take off the excess maybe
all right
how much fun would it be well i feel
if it turned into a trump armada
with trump 2024 flags on the back of
every pickup truck
and you know using ships and planes and
and trucks
it could be kind of fun
it would be kind of fun wouldn't it
because we already see that there you
know there were trump armadas in the in
the ocean
and they did it because it was fun
they liked seeing other people doing it
you know et cetera i feel like you could
do a trump armada of trucks and just
take 10 off the top of the load
all right um how many of you know what
the jones act is
have you heard of that
the jones act
now i don't know enough about it to
speak uh intelligently
but
what i know is that it's some kind of
act
that was put in by some kind of special
interest
that's not good for the world but it was
good for whoever the special interest
was that prevents ships from
uh what is it picking up stuff if they
go to multiple ports or something like
that the the quick version of this
is that there is an act some legislation
if you got rid of it would instantly
make everything more efficient
now i don't know if it fixes this
problem immediately because maybe you
know there's too much that's already
there in the ports but in the long run
apparently it's
um
oh this is u.s flagships only
only if it's a u.s crew somebody says
all right so i don't know the details of
this jones act because i literally was
exposed to it five minutes before
getting on here
but there's something there that would
that a trump could take care of that
maybe
maybe a biden can't because it's about
removing regulations it's about
executive orders it's about being a
leader really
the jones act is protecting our shipping
industry
okay so the special interest is u.s
shipping industry
um
okay he tried and hit a buzz saw
somebody says unions are the problems
yeah well we have a crisis so a crisis
is a good time to test the limits of
of what you thought was a barrier before
all right
so let's see what else is going
rasmussen has poll
says
they asked how important is it that
democrat senators oppose the president
you know the democrat president
so
i'm paraphrasing but the question was do
people like it that democrat senators
are thwarting the president or at least
having some pushback and weirdly 59
percent of democrats said yes
so let me say this again
democrats
are happy that they elected joe biden or
at least they were
but they're also happy that the
democratic senators prevent joe biden
from doing the job and vice versa
so they like democrats as long as the
democrats aren't doing anything
now i'm exaggerating a little bit but i
think it's funny that 59
want biden to be in charge and also
somebody else to stop him from doing too
much
that's not crazy
it just is funny when you say it it's
completely
reasonable to want to have a check in
the balance
joe manchin gets the
good persuasion award for the morning
from me
apparently joe manchin is alleged
alleged to have said in a closed door
meeting with bernie sanders
when bernie i guess was getting on him
about trying to stop the 3.5 trillion
bill
uh and manchin wanted you know maybe one
trillion
and
it sounds like bernie was getting on
optimum about the fact that if they
don't compromise
they're gonna get zero
so apparently bernie said something like
if you don't compromise with us we're
not gonna get anything and what was joe
manchin's response to if you don't
compromise will get nothing
quote
how about zero
i'm comfortable with that
how about zero
that
is exactly the right answer now for
negotiating i'm not saying the i'm not
saying the right answer is a zero bill
because maybe the trillion makes sense i
don't know it's hard for me to know
but
i liked the way he handled that the only
correct answer is if somebody says
i'm going to shoot you if you don't do
that
the only correct answer for negotiating
is here you go
shoot away
let's get this over with
right if you're not willing to go to
zero and you can't sell the fact that
you'll go to zero
you're not really gonna have much
leverage right
he has to sell the fact that he would
take zero over what they're offering
and i think he did
i think he sold it
so
good work joe manchin and the in the
narrow question of persuasion that was
good work
apparently terry mcauliffe who's running
for what the hell is he running for
governor
of virginia
is that what terry mcauliffe is running
for
i barely watch state politics but
apparently in his uh tv ads he's using
virginia governor okay thank you
is that
he's using the fine people hoax as if
it's real again
unbelievable
there's still people using the find
people hoax today
the most debunked hoax in the history of
hoaxes
all right
um
and i was thinking what would his
opponent do
to debunk the fine people hoax
all right what would you do if you were
the opponent and you thought it was
necessary to address that maybe it isn't
but if you thought it was necessary to
address that he was pushing that hoax
how would you do it
here's how not to do it
tell everybody it's a hoax
that's how not to do it
because people are already primed to
believe what they're going to believe so
it would just make him look like he fell
into the trap
so if terry mcauliffe's opponent i don't
even know his name if he decided to push
back on that say hey that's a hoax that
never happened
it would just look like you was a racist
you can't push back on it
that's the diabolically
wonderful thing about it
you can't really defend it if you're
running for office because you'll just
immediately be painted as a defender of
that speech that didn't happen
right here's how you do it
you put it on a list
of hoaxes
and you make sure that you have a a link
to the explanation of it as a hoax maybe
a link to all of them
do it on a list say here are the list of
hoaxes
you know we had the the
everything from
jessie's molette small a is it
to uh the bleach hoax the drinking
bleach the goldfish oaks the
you know the uh what is it the kids
hoax the what you call the kids
right and you just put it on the list
if you put it on the list with other
hoaxes
and you you link to the description of
why it's a hoax covington kids thank you
the covington kids thing the mini noose
etc
if you put it on a list of hoaxes
then you diminish it
by putting it in this body of hoaxes
then you can do it now it's not a strong
attack but it's the only one you can do
because if you just talk about that then
you're just a damn racist or it'll look
like it but if you call it out as a list
of hoaxes
that looks different doesn't it
my opponent can't tell real news from
hoaxes
how's that feel
my opponent
terry mcauliffe
wants to be your governor and he can't
tell the difference between real news
and a hoax look at this list
he picked this out of a list of hoaxes
and he's trying to sell it to you
russia collusion hoax thank you the
obvious one
right
well
alec baldwin finally killed someone
i feel like that was only a matter of
time
i don't know how to talk about a story
that's horribly tragic
and funny at the same time
it's a tough one it's a tough one
because you know you want to be a
decent human being and there's innocent
people who got wounded in one case
killed
and that's not funny
that's not funny
but alec baldwin
was the person who did it and you know
we're hearing some unconfirmed reports
of
you know what he was doing prior to that
it looked like he might have been
telling a joke because he thought the
gun had blanks or something
but
let me say the obvious
i think alec baldwin was an anti-gun guy
right
am i right
alec baldwin was an
anti-gun activist
do you know what would have prevented
this accident among other things
the number one thing that would have
prevented this accident
if he had firearms training
literally nobody with firearms training
let's say nra training
literally nobody with firearms training
would have done that
none zero
i i think
correct me if i'm wrong
how many of you have taken gun training
so let me know how many of you taken any
firearms training
do you think you could take firearms
training
and walk away without thinking you could
ever
ever under any condition
point a gun that's a prop gun a fake gun
a toy gun
any kind of gun one you think is
unloaded
do you think the nra or any firearms
training would let you point any gun at
any person ever
no
no that's an absolute
there's nothing more absolute than that
no no i don't think it's loaded no
no it has blanks in it i'm pretty sure
no
no never because by the way the blanks
can kill you
just at a shorter distance
because the blanks have gunpowder it's
shooting some you know at least gas and
forces out
so you can kill somebody with a blank
that's the thing
now
and of course you never and by the way
even if even if it was a plastic gun
even if it were plastic
should he aim it at somebody
not if there's somebody else with a gun
anywhere around
right
if there's somebody else with a gun
they're gonna they're gonna pull it
if somebody sees somebody pointing a
plastic gun to somebody and it looks you
know sort of real
you're gonna you're gonna unload at the
very least you might not shoot
but you're gonna de-holster
right
yeah if you think it's a real gun
so we don't know if he was killed by a
blank or an actual round do we know the
the answer to that yet
was there an actual live round in the
gun
because it's hard to believe
but i don't think we know that which is
weird that we don't know that
um
so here's what we've learned owning a
gun is dangerous but not owning a gun is
is dangerous too a different way
but had he been a gun owner almost
certainly would have taken some kind of
training this would have happened
if he had been a gun owner it wouldn't
have happened
irony is just screaming here
uh there's a question of uh
why he shot two people
so that's sort of an open question
one possibility is that it was one
bullet that killed one person and grazed
another
uh the other possibility is that he's
been in enough movies that he knows that
if he accidentally kills somebody he's
got to get rid of the witness
got to get rid of the witness now i'm
not saying that's what happened
i'm just saying we don't know what
happened
all right um have you heard of buyer's
remorse
oh and by the way on this alec baldwin
thing
i i swear it looks like there's an
anti-trump
critic
curse
is it
oh it could be shrapnel yeah
is it my imagination
or do people who are prominent critics
of trump end up with bad futures
it feels like it right anyway let's talk
about uh biden remorse this is a hashtag
i made up yesterday uh sounds like
buyer's remorse doesn't it i feel like
we're getting some of that buyer's
remorse from biden
let's call it biden remorse
i guess i didn't have much to say about
that except biden remorse sounds funny
to me
how many of you if you heard if you if
you heard the term
biden remorse
how many of you would know that's a play
on buyer's remorse is it close enough
because i don't know if it's close
enough that oh you would okay all right
you all picked up on that
okay
i wasn't sure if that was obvious
all right
um
thank you to uh
twitter user and follower of my material
brian keith i guess he's ceo of
fractional
and he wrote a long tweet today about
his experience um consuming my material
from dilbert through through the live
streams
and it was really well thought out and i
appreciate it a lot so i'm just going to
say thank you if you want to take a look
at it it's i tweeted it this morning
um
almost every day somebody says why
aren't you talking about that evil
fouchy and is lying about his game of
function stuff
and
i'm just not seeing the same story you
are
now
is fouchy lying about gain of function
he in in the
intentionally misleading way i suppose
i mean i think you could make that
argument
because there was gain of function
work
and he and apparently it did get funded
directly or indirectly through something
that he was associated with he did deny
it
and it is fairly conclusively
demonstrated that it was happening
so if you hear that he's denying it
but it really happened
what is your conclusion
that he lied right the obvious
conclusion is they lied
i'm not seeing it
and by the way i'm not i'm not a fouchy
defender
so you know it's not like i i just side
with him and i'm trying to defend him
here's why i don't see it
because his explanation is that they
used a different term
that the term gained a function
i think he's trying to weasel it as
being maybe uh more military than it was
and the question is
what goes into that definition of gain a
function so to me it looks like he's
just using a definition thing saying
that's not how i define it
so by my own definition i didn't do it
and then other people say well but by
our definition you did
so what is there to talk about
by his definition he didn't do it
by somebody else's definition he did
we're only talking about the definition
we're not even arguing about what
happened
if you're not arguing about what
happened
what are you arguing about
the what happened part is important now
here's what i understand from my light
reading of the topic
that there's some kind of things that
you would call gain a function
that would just be smart to do
let me ask you that
give me a fact check on that because
that's more opinion than fact right
is there something that somebody who is
an expert in the field
would call maybe one sliver of gain of
function
that would be not only
worth doing but might reduce your risk
in the long run
yes or no
is there any gain of function that would
have been justifiable
not not building a weapon so i'm not
talking about building a weapon
out of a virus i'm talking about
tweaking a virus to see if you can
change its characteristics which might
give you some insight about what other
people are doing in other countries and
also some insight about what things to
be ready for
you know for vaccines and stuff
it's playing with fire okay
but is every kind of testing playing
with fire
is every kind
i think
here's my assumption
and until i'm proven wrong i'm going to
stick with it all right my assumption is
that when you use a phrase like gain a
function it's a pretty big label
and that fouchy
did do things that would be under that
category
and has denied it
but
maybe defining it differently as in no
no the gain of function you're talking
about
is turning a less harmless or more
harmless virus into a dangerous one we
didn't do that
maybe he didn't
now maybe somebody did it that you know
they didn't know about maybe there's a
rogue you know maybe there was some
confusion about what got funded
but it could be true
that by his definition it didn't happen
by his definition but you'd have to buy
his definition of it and i don't think
it's necessarily unreasonable
if it's true and here's my big
assumption if it's true
she'll adam's at his best
so all the people doing all caps
are experiencing cognitive dissonance so
here over on
you can see an example over on
youtube
skid buff says in all caps shill adams
at his best
that's not really a comment is it
you know here would be here would be a
comment with a functional brain a
functional brain would say i challenge
your assumption
i i don't think there's a difference of
definition
that would be that would be a smart
comment
something worthy of your time
do you know what it wouldn't
be and all caps
scott's the shield
scott's a shell
yeah it doesn't help
doesn't help
all right for those who challenge my
assumption
um
that's fair
you still did it in all caps though
all right is there anybody here who
would
agree with my assumption
right is there anybody who would agree
that what it looks like there's a
difference in definition going on here
that that's that's the the heart of it
seeing uh
one yes mostly no
a few yeses
nope nope nope i'm seeing almost all
no's on youtube
over on locals mostly no
but some yes
if this were a if this were a criminal
uh
prosecution
and and you had to achieve
a standard of you know no reasonable
doubt
and you saw that a lot of people are
watching the story and saying i think
it's just a definitional difference
does fauci have reasonable doubt
there are a lot of people watching the
story who have the same opinion i do a
minority there are more people who
disagree than agree but there are a lot
of people
who say yeah it just looks like a
definition thing
doesn't mean i'm right but if this were
a court case
he would not be convicted
because there are enough people looking
at this thing now it looks ambiguous to
me
you know i don't think that's enough to
you know
put him on fire
all right so um
don't take that as a defensive fouchy
that is only a uh
explanation of my observation
all right i don't defend him i i don't
have a sense
that he's done the best job
but i'm not terribly sure that this is
the right uh attack vector
all right uh
biden's approval level is down to 37
according to quinnipac
and uh 78 in the same poll said 78 of
republicans want donald trump to run
again in 2024.
78
want him to run again
uh do you think anybody else is going to
win the primary
i'll tell you nothing could make trump
president better than biden's
performance
it's just crazy how bad it is
60 of independents on the same poll
said they disapproved of biden's
performance how could you possibly
you know keep trump out of the white
house with this now i don't think he'd
be running against biden but he's going
to be running against somebody that
biden beat
that sounded funny when i said it
so 60 of independents disapprove of
biden
which would clearly be a number that he
couldn't get reelected
but uh
anyway i i thought i had a good point
but maybe i didn't i think i'll bail out
of that one
all right um
randy weingarten who you might know as
the president of aft which is probably
american federated teachers the teachers
union so she's president of i guess the
biggest teachers union or
or is there a tissues union above
teachers unions what exactly is her role
i don't know if she's a head of the
biggest teachers union or is there
something that's on top of all teachers
unions
can somebody explain that
is she nea is the biggest
so she's just one of the big ones
is that the actual
situation
all right so
um
the loudest one
anyway she's uh
she's a leader in the
teachers unions
and she tweeted that uh kids were very
damaged by the lockdowns
that's right
a leader
who stopped kids from going to school
wants you to know that the kids were
very damaged mentally psychologically
developmentally
by
the lockdown
the person who is singly most
responsible for causing it
wants you to know that gosh it sure
looks bad for those kids
unfrickin believable
uh aft is higher education than nea
well we're confused about some of these
roles but
maybe we'll sort that out
um
so what she said was in a tweet i think
a lot of people forget that our children
are also facing immense trauma
as a result of the pandemic and the
isolation of quarantine and school via
zoom
the things that
she caused
many of her did
or at least
was very persuasive in
all right um the funniest statement and
i'll i'll end on this because i got to
leave a little early today
it says cnn has and i love doing this
i love using cnn's own biased language
against them do you know how when
somebody does something wrong and then
they
try to support it later and cnn always
says they're doubling down
oh trump doubled down on his bleach
drinking or whatever usually it's fake
news
um
so i'm going to say they double down
apparently they are defending
their
their
their network's coverage of joe rogan
and the many references on it that he
was taking a horse medicine
which of course he was not
it's fake news and cnn instead of saying
you know
you're right we probably shouldn't have
couched it that way or framed it that
way sorry about that
but you know it was opinion
i think cnn had a perfectly good
defense and the defense would be yeah
sorry that was probably a little
misleading it came out of our our
opinion people
and uh we would have thought that you
would have known it was hyperbole
that that wouldn't be a bad defense
you know i mean not complete defense but
this would be better than what they did
so they decided not to apologize and
went hard and said the only thing they
did wrong was hurt the ego of a
celebrity joe rogan
that's all they did wrong they heard his
ego
well
i'm not so sure about that um
but
even i guess the washington post had a
uh article by eric wempel who just
eviscerated
cnn's treatment
uh and and their integrity because i
this was just a clear fake news i think
most people would say is a clear example
of just
uh the media being
despicable
and they decided to double down
but maybe that works i don't know
um
wouldn't it depend on the hoaxer's
definition of bleach
nope
[Laughter]
nope
i don't think anybody would call light
therapy
bleach
disinfectant yes
so it does defend depend on your
definition of disinfectant but not on
your definition of bleach bleach is a
pretty
pretty clear
word
yeah they double down online
all right
and that
is pretty much what i wanted to talk
about today
so
did i miss anything are there any
stories that you wish i talked about
that i didn't
how is boo boo's looking good we still
have to figure out if the cancer
diagnosis is real it's a little
ambiguous still
yes trump could own the definition of
disinfectant
crypto and bitcoin
um
i think bitcoin is down today right
let's see how bitcoin's doing
uh
bitcoin bitcoin
hey bitcoin how you doing yeah it's down
today
oh trump social we talked about that
yesterday you know i signed up for
information on it early sign up we'll
see if i get invited
u.s patent
pfizer says the coven vaccine is more
than 90
effective in kids
beta vegas sorry
i'm just looking at all your comments
now so anybody wants to bail out at this
point
it wouldn't be a bad time to do it
yeah if you haven't watched my video
with uh viva and barnes
just google that viva barnes scott adams
it'll pop right up um i'm seeing a lot
of good comments on the locals platform
from people who saw they enjoyed it
quite a bit
and it does have some drama in it
towards the beginning so you won't want
to miss that but also catch my uh
my
interview with
bjorn lomborg uh on climate change
craziness and the things we get wrong
about that
uh the people who watch that are pretty
impressed actually because you get a ton
of information you probably didn't know
about climate change
in just a few minutes
all right i'm going to
take off in a moment
and
oh my god
so the i i just have to read this
the uh the alec baldwin thing is just
there needs to be some word for
something that's a tragedy that's funny
because you know it's funny if you don't
know the victim i suppose
and of course we're all bad people
but i have to read this because it's
just horrible humor that we can't be
proud of
i won't know if you're laughing
i won't know if you're laughing about
this
so
you know you're okay you're safe all
right
the tweet says is from somebody named
dan on
twitter says alec baldwin now has a
higher body count than the entire
january 6 armed insurrection
um
wow
yeah the the irony is here
oh my goodness
alec baldwin actually had a tweet
somebody's retweeting
where alec baldwin said of some other
accidental shooting in the past he
tweeted i wonder how it must feel to
wrongly wrongfully kill someone
wow
i feel like the simulation
yeah
i'm seeing the word simulation go by
this looks
doesn't this look scripted
does any of this look like it naturally
happened
you know
the the obvious explanation is that
coincidences happen all the time and
when they don't happen you don't notice
them and when they do happen you notice
them so you think they're happening all
the time but so it could be just
coincidence that's the most likely
explanation but it sure looks like
something's going on i mean it looks
like the simulation it just looks like
too many weird coincidences all right
uh
i gotta go
and uh i wish i could stay longer i
really do but i have to run today
