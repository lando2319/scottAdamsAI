oh it's going down today
wow we're gonna have trouble today
but that's what makes it one of the best
coffees with scott adams of all time
and if you don't believe it well let me
prove it to you
and all you need is a copper marker
glass of tango chelsea die in a canteen
jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today i
think it makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and boy do i feel bad for the people who
didn't make it here on time
you're gonna have to take up your game a
little bit more to
come in on time here it is the
simultaneous hip
go
ah better than bleach
yeah so yesterday after being out of the
country for eight days or
so i went to the grocery store
put on my mask i was walking around the
grocery store and
i saw somebody without a mask and i
thought my god how long will it be
before this poor bastard is kicked out
of the grocery store
and then i saw another person without a
mask and i thought
two people without a mask at a grocery
store
what kind of what kind of crazy life am
i in
and then i noticed that basically
almost everybody didn't have a mask
because while i was gone
the rules changed and i forgot
so uh i took off my mask because i'm
fully vaccinated and apparently this
store does not have any
rules that would override the state's
suggestion that you don't need a mask if
you vaccinated
and for the first time the first time
for me i know most of you have already
experienced this
but for me the first time at a grocery
store
in over a year without a mask
it felt really good now i know i'm way
behind
all of you because not only am i in
california which is behind
but i'm personally was a week behind
even california so you're already there
but i gotta tell you it felt
felt great it just felt
freaking great i understand there's
still a few
places that might require one like at
the health care organization
i think if i go to my hmo i need a mask
still but i'll give them that you know
it's you don't go to the health care
place that often
and it is a medical place so
you know you can see why they would be
last to make a change
there's lots going on number one it
turns out there's a new study that says
coffee is good for your liver
ah you thought that the simultaneous sip
was only about an introduction to this
amazing content
um
and no it's more than that the
simultaneous sip is keeping you healthy
it is not only connecting to you to all
the people in the world
probably boosting your oxytocin i don't
have a scientific study to prove that
but it just feels like it but also it's
making your liver
healthier if you don't overdo it three
or four cups a day
and your liver will be well as good as
new
and uh and that means you can drink a
little extra
no no that's bad medical advice don't
take medical advice from cartoonists
don't drink just have a nice healthy
liver and for that few cups of coffee
might help you allegedly
so there's a new racist movie um
probably the racist thing i've seen in
my adult life
so bad that it's just a head shaker
here it is
it's a it's a anti-white movie i mean i
don't know how you could call it
anything else
with a star who is named karen
and she plays a karen you know the
classical karen behavior
and the setup for this movie is that
a black family moves in next to a woman
named
karen and then this karen person becomes
a monster version of karen
and does everything she can to get the
black family to move out
because she's a big old racist and she
does every like legal trick
and to get them in trouble and
accusations and
yeah and that sort of thing now i have
several comments about this
number one the marketing for this movie
is really brilliant it's really
brilliant
if you could find any movie idea
that would more make people want to
watch it than this thing
good luck good luck you know it's not a
superhero movie and those do well
but if you're trying to make somebody
see a smaller budget movie
oh my god this is clever because it hits
it just hits everything like every one
of your emotional buttons is like
where
so i hate this movie and the people who
made it
should be deeply condemned i'll probably
watch it
[Laughter]
because it's brilliantly terrible i mean
this is really
like bad for society bad for
people it's just bad
but really good marketing
so um and honestly i can't think of
anything that's been more racist
than this because essentially it's just
uh
if you wanted to summarize the movie
it's uh
white people are awful there you go
there's my movie review
white people are awful so
here's a chance for black americans to
improve their brand
which i think everybody should think
about because
how you're thought about in whatever
group you
are or even as an individual it matters
right
if people like you and respect you
you'll have a better life
so any chance you get to improve your
brand
you should take it take for example
you've seen a number of clips
of black americans speaking out against
critical race theory
at let's say meetings of
you know school boards and stuff now
what does that do
to the the brand if you can call it that
the reputation
of black americans really good
really good because when you see black
americans being on both sides of an
issue that has some racial
component you say to yourself oh there
are some people
who are thinking it through come into
different opinions
but they're not just saying i'm black so
i'm on on this side
you know there's you have all the nuance
and the disagreement
so when you look at that as a non-black
person
how do you how do you feel about black
americans
good right and it doesn't matter that
there are more people on one side than
the other you're just seeing a good
healthy i think
completely helpful
disagreement among adults who have
thought it through
that's great for the brand you know
i don't know if it's offensive to talk
in terms of brands but i don't think it
should be
this karen movie is the same thing if
if all that comes out of this is people
go to it and talk about it and like it
well i think it's a missed opportunity
because i'd love to see some black
americans say look
if this were reversed it would be a
hundred percent unacceptable
let's just agree on that if all they did
is reverse
sort of the the theme of the movie
no way this gets into the theaters i'd
love to see some black americans say
look let's
you know we got plenty of real stuff to
disagree with
we don't need this this is just making
stuff worse
it doesn't make anybody better off right
so i'd love to see some pushback on that
don't know if we'll see it
um you know there's
there's a new story uh let's say what
was a
google app so google has an app
and the hat tip to david smith who
pointed this out on twitter
and the app will identify a skin lesion
and tell you if it's a problem i assume
that means cancers are non-cancerous
and uh weirdly it got approved in
europe but not by the fda
so in europe they'll be able to use the
app but in the united states they will
not
now which one of them used science
because they got different answers right
they got different answers from exactly
the same data
so was the fda following science
or is europe following science
because you'd like to follow science
wouldn't you which way do you go
one says yes one says no
same data
the biggest con ever perpetrated on the
public in the modern day
and i'll put the modern in there because
you know there may have been worse ones
in the past
but the biggest con is that you can
follow the science
if you could if it were a thing
something that actual humans could do
it'd be a great idea
probably because then you'd you'd be
following the most rational path
wouldn't always be right but you'd
always be rational in taking that
that set of odds right but
it's just not something humans can do
look at this this is just a perfect
example if you could follow the
the science then both europe and the fda
would be on the same side
same science science didn't change
so as soon as people say follow the
science you should see that
as manipulation
because it probably is not for everybody
who says it but
beware that when anybody in the
leadership position says follow the
science
they might have control over what you
think is the science
so what they're really saying is do what
i'm telling you but they're disguising
do what i tell you to do because they're
saying well it's backed by science
but is it when you can have different
opinions about what the science is
no it's just an opinion supported by
you know an interpretation of science
that just happens to go your way
it's not much different than the way
religion is used
follow the religion who gets to define
where the religion is going the pope
god i don't know so you can't really
follow science if science doesn't even
know where it's going
it's a ridiculous concept and at the
same time
you should follow the science it's both
ridiculous and common sense
at the same time it's a weird thing i
don't know if there's anything quite
like it
because i'm not going to tell you not to
follow the science
that would be stupid i'm just telling
you you can't
do it reliably and you should probably
learn to know the difference all right i
just told you earlier that
coffee is good for your liver because
there's
one study about that one study
is it a good study will it hold up if
if other people do studies will it match
it
don't know so should you drink more
coffee because this one study says it's
good for your liver
probably not there are other reasons to
drink coffee
but following the science just isn't
something people can do
you just have to understand that
all right um i've got a skeptics
challenge here there was a tweet
in which there's a claim some kind of
ons
survey i don't think any of this is
credible by the way so
so the context which i'm giving this to
you is a
claim which i do not find credible but i
tweeted it
because i'd like i'd like you to pour
through it and see if you can figure out
you know how credible you think it is
the claim is this that
a survey showed that 87 of adults in the
uk
had antibodies to the coronavirus
by june 7th from vaccination
or infection prior to mid-may so if you
added infections
prior infections plus vaccinations 87
percent
had antibodies given vaccination rates
this tweet goes on to say simple math
determines that 70 to 80 percent of
total uk population had been infected by
mid-may
which means that vaccinations and
everything else were a waste
if if that interpretation held up
what do you think of that what what's
your reaction to
this data i'm going to look at the
comments i will see what your reaction
is
i hear some say wow okay wow 87
okay
somebody says yeah i think we all have
it somebody says terrible data somebody
says not true
nonsense no way sounds sketchy
yeah all right so here's my take on this
this
outcome this 87 thing and then
even taking it down to how much natural
immunity there must have been
is so far outside expectation
that the odds of this being true or
really low
meaning that if you're learning about it
in this tweet and nobody
nobody in any industrial country had
noticed
that somehow their entire country
because if it's true in the uk
it would obviously be true in some other
number of countries
that there would be massive amount of
immunity
but wouldn't we have noticed that don't
you think
i feel like the odds that this wouldn't
be a story in every country and just be
so obvious that everybody knew it by now
i don't think you could believe this
this doesn't sound
it doesn't even sound in the universe of
things that you should take seriously
it's just too far out there
and it's a little too far on it's a
little too on the nose right
it's what so many of you wanted to
believe is exactly true
i would rule this out um based on just
being too far out the mainstream
we would have known this by way before
now
and there's another claim in here that
infections dropped
after january 1st before there were many
vaccinations so if if the curve was
already plummeting
after january before there were many
vaccinations
logically this this
this information suggests that maybe we
had
way more natural immunity from
infections but
don't you all know that infections
always drop after january
because it's not the holiday season and
the
the travel patterns change so
we all expect it to go down after the
holidays
everybody did so that doesn't mean that
you were
there was herd immunity it just means
you stopped going on holiday and
infecting your aunt
that's all it meant or that's all it
could have meant
so their interpretation here i think is
ridiculous i would ignore that but i put
it on
on twitter if somebody wants to argue
that it's more credible than i think
all right i have a confession all right
i'm going to do something that's going
to be painful for a lot of you
but i need to set it up first
you've heard me make some opinions that
you don't like
and don't don't turn this off yet all
right because this won't be the normal
conversation we're going to get into
something a little deeper
you've heard my opinions on trans
athletes and you said
i hate that here's a confession
i'm not sure i told you my exact
accurate opinion on this topic
i may have been enjoying myself
stimulating cognitive dissonance in
people
because it teaches me how to spot it
in other words if you trigger it you get
to see how people respond and then you
see the pattern
you go oh these are cognitive dissonance
responses
and then these are good ones i'm going
to tell you for the first time
something close to my real opinion this
will be the first time you've heard it
okay
and i'm going to couch it in
a discussion of which people who
responded to my tweet today
have a tell for cognitive dissonance and
which ones simply have a good argument
okay so let me start with the people who
have a good argument
because i feel that they will be the
ones who are on your side for the most
part
so i'm going to be pacing you this is a
persuasion technique
i'm going to start by agreeing with the
things that i know we can agree on
and if we if i get you to agree on a
bunch of things
you're going to be a little bit better
primed
for me to take you someplace that might
be a little uncomfortable
you ready for this so this isn't about
transgender athletes number one
i don't care so here's the first part of
my opinion that you'll hear for the
first time
don't really care about the issue i
don't have a
daughter or stepdaughter who's involved
i don't really
watch sports enough to care
i think there are probably a million
ways that you could handle it no matter
what you do
you know ways to mitigate things ways to
fix it
don't don't much care okay so that's the
first thing
um but i do love
what you learn about the argument all
right so let me start with the good
arguments
for why transgender athletes should not
be
allowed to play on traditional women's
teams
okay now this part would agree with most
of you i think
and here's a good argument let's see
before i get to the bad ones the ones
that are cognitive dissonance
um
i have to work through all the bad ones
here give me a minute
all right here are the non-cognitive
dissonance
arguments for why transgender athletes
should not be
allowed to play on traditional women's
teams
here's one from zombies other mowers old
question mark that's the name of the
twitter account so zombies mower
says maybe maybe think of it another way
and he argues to me he says you've said
you don't like biden's tax plan
because it's changing the rules after
they were established
which is true i i lived my life
building a certain kind of life and
financial situation under
the old set of tax laws and if i run
into a wall
suddenly they change well that doesn't
feel fair because i planned my whole
life
life on a certain basis and then it
changed
so zombie's saying you think of it the
same way
there are people and then he goes on the
same may be said for the females
that committed and trained for the
olympics only for the rules to be
changed
later on now do you detect any cognitive
dissonance
in in this response no
no now you could agree with it or you
could disagree with it
but is there anything in it that signals
that
that there's some cognitive dissonance
going on none
this is a perfectly reasonable argument
right i'm not sure it settles it one way
or another but as a point
i have nothing to say about that a
perfectly valid
statement that the rules changed
and people don't like it it feels unfair
we all register that
that it feels unfair when rules change
but
let me let me just toss out
a a counter to that
the counter is that when the topic is
bigotry and discrimination
you still change the rules right
if if if you had been born in a system
in which
slavery had been the expectations and
you'd built your life based on owning
slaves
and then somebody came along and
suddenly changed the system
well that's so unfair for you because
you made your life based on
benefiting from slavery the point is
when bigotry is the issue as as is the
case with transgender athletes
when bigotry is in the issue you can
change the rules
the moment you can right the moment you
can change the rules
go ahead and do it that's the exception
to the rule
now but
let me say that while i have a counter
to this argument that the rules changed
is still a good point right the way you
feel about it
is it feels unfair because of this very
thing so that's a good point no
cognitive dissonance there
here's another one uh tankerjd
user on twitter says this uh to me
says that's not the point and he says uh
i think you see
women's and girls sports was something
nice
that men did for their daughters wives
and sisters
to allow biological men this would be
his description of a trans athlete
into the sport is to take away that gift
good point right now you could disagree
with it and you could agree with it
but there's no cognitive dissonance in
this this is just a good point
the good point is that it was a gift in
a sense or
or let's say people thought of it that
way
and if something is given to you no
matter what it is
and then it's taken away can that ever
feel fair
no of course not it would never feel
fair but
is it fair well as i've
often said famously fairness
it was invented so that idiots
could participate in debates fairness
isn't the thing
there's no you can't grab a handful of
fairness
you can't measure it it's subjective
what's fair to you seems unfair to me
in fact any change to anything causes
unfairness
to somebody all right so we don't live
in a world in which you can manage
to fairness but yet we have we have an
impression of what's fair
is it is it reasonable to say that the
men who thought
they wanted to build a better world for
their daughters and sisters and
whatever would it be fair to say that
they thought they were giving a gift
and women thought they were receiving
one they wouldn't think of it as a gift
they would think of it as fairness
but it doesn't feel right to have
anything taken away from
anybody i get that and i'm
totally legitimate variable to put in
there that somebody would feel bad
especially if they trained their whole
life that's a good opinion
my uh you know there are counters for it
but it's
perfectly fair opinion no cognitive
dissonance in that opinion would you
agree so far
so far are most of us on the same page
that these are actually pretty good
opinions even if you disagree with them
and that they don't signal any kind of
cognitive dissonance
all right
i think there's another one
cheryl corey on twitter says in a
reasonable question
says if we don't separate sports by sex
then what are the implications for
women's sports now this would be
similar related to the points of
something
that we liked was in existence and we
don't want to lose it
who wants to lose something that's
working if you have daughters who are
playing on a team
and they like it and you like watching
it why would you want to lose that or
have it diminished in some way according
to you
nobody does so those are all good
arguments now let me show you the other
ones
here's how you know if you are
experiencing cognitive dissonance
the arguments i've given you so far do
not have that quality
there's nothing about them that a
trained hypnotist or a psychologist
would say oh there's something wrong
with that
but now give you now let me give you the
alternatives
all right and by the way here was the uh
here was my tweet
that caused people to respond
and i'm not going to argue that this
tweet makes sense
right so so this is my confession
that i'm not trolling per se just to get
a random result
i'm kind of fascinated at how people
process
this topic and so i tweeted something
that i knew would get a response so
that's all you're going to see here
this is just a tweet that was intended
to get a response and make people think
about it differently
it wasn't just to trouble it was to
teach you something
and maybe learn something myself right
here is the tweet
i said uh this morning it is unfair for
trans athletes to compete on women's
teams
because of the strength difference would
most of you agree with that statement
that it is unfair for trans athletes to
compete on
women's teams because of the strength
difference
primarily now some of you have said oh
there's some mental differences etc
but primarily it's a strength difference
wouldn't you say
size and strength but more strength
all right so if we agree on that here's
the second part
it is fair for lebron james to compete
against me
for a spot on an nba team because the
only thing that's holding me back
is my poor work ethic but otherwise
lebron james is a man and i'm a man
so the fact that he gets on the team
sort of denies me a spot on an nba team
doesn't it
well not really right it's just being
provocative
and i'm trying to make the point that we
live in a world in which nothing is fair
nothing is fair fairness is a ridiculous
standard
is it fair that lebron can play in the
nba
and i don't have a chance no
that's not fair is it fair that i was
born with apparently
some kind of wiring that allows me to be
a cartoonist
but i'll bet i'm just statistically
speaking
i'll bet if lebron tried to become a
professional cartoonist
he'd have some trouble is that fair is
it fair that i was born with this talent
that
gives me a you know a great life and
maybe
somebody else doesn't have it no it's
not fair it just is
so um if the problem is somebody losing
a spot
which is the argument you often hear hey
somebody is going to lose that spot it
would have gone to a
to a woman who had trained all their
life for it and then got
got knocked down the spot if the problem
is that somebody's losing a spot
you have to take that argument further
don't you and say
every smallish man is losing a spot in
the nba
to say that i'm a man and lebron james
as a man is ridiculous
yes we're both biologically men i get it
but really so we can compete because
we're both men
most people can't compete with a
professional athlete
it's ridiculous to say that you know men
have it fair
because we can fairly compete against
lebron james
no we can't no we can't i can't compete
against lebron james
any more than a you know somebody who
was born biologically female can compete
against a weightlifter
who had been identifying male until
yesterday
all right so you gotta you gotta be
consistent in your argument anyway
so that's what would have triggered the
cognitive dissonance if it worked
in other words i set the reader up
to trigger cognitive dissonance that was
intentional
so i'm confessing that and
my view and this is just speculation is
that the the real problem that people
have
with the transgender athletes probably
is an uncanny value
valley problem which is if you've heard
of the uncanny valley
idea it's the idea that if you built a
robot and it didn't look anything like a
human it just looked like a robot
that would be cool but if you made your
robot
almost look like a human but just a
little bit different so you could detect
the difference
it would be creepy you wouldn't want to
be anywhere near it you'd be like ugh
it's not really a human but it's so
close it's like a zombie or something
right
so that theory is that you you have
revulsion
about things that are almost human but
not quite
and uh by analogy i'm not saying
that anybody's non-human in this example
so don't take that out of it
by analogy if your world view is men and
women
stereotypical and then you see somebody
who doesn't fit the stereotype
your brain is going to say that's almost
like what i'm expecting people to act
like
but it's not quite there because i can't
resolve the gender
and then it becomes this uncomfortable
thing for the viewer
but is that fair to the people who are
triggering that in you or is that a
problem in you
i say it's a problem in you because i
would say that if you look at the
let's say the history of lgbtq people in
this country
simple exposure to more people in that
community
makes whatever feelings you had about
what is right and typical and
stereotypical just go away
and that if you live in california for i
don't know a month
whatever uncomfortable feeling you had
about people not fitting your model of
exactly sexuality
being binary yeah you just get over it
right so it's more about it's more about
the viewer it just feels like it's about
the topic but it's really something
that's happening inside you
it's just your your experience of not
being able to resolve things the way you
want them to be to be
this or that so i think that
drives a lot of the feelings but people
don't want to admit that they just have
a feeling about it
right people want to argue with their
data and their logic and their reasons
because that looks cool but arguing i
just don't like it
it just makes me feel uncomfortable
nobody says that so they don't argue
that way
um yes sean the the brain is a pattern
recognition machine that's
that supports my point and
i think also as some of the commenters
said
that a lot of the motivation is that a
lot of men just want to be supportive of
women
in their life they want to support their
daughter or their
their friends their sister their mom
whatever and that
if women don't like this idea let's say
the majority of women don't like the
idea of
of their daughter missing the spot then
i think men
we're just sort of designed to want to
support women
i don't think anything is more basic to
our biological nature
as men than sort of wanting to support
women
you know make them happy so that's part
of it
which has nothing to do with logic and
nothing to do with facts
people just want to support other people
sometimes
and they'll take whatever argument gets
that done
so that's the first thing and then
uh i would say that you need to break
the argument into two parts
because youth sports is really about the
athletes themselves
more than the entertainment value right
if you've got a high schooler in a sport
it's more about
the student it's not about the parents
or the audience
but if it's professional sports it's
really not about the athlete
it's really about the audience so so
treating the
student athlete and the professional
athlete as if it's the same conversation
won't make sense because you're not
pursuing even the same objective with
either those
so given those two different objectives
one being about the athlete for the
younger people and one being about the
audience
for the professionals let's look at it
through that lens
and and don't conflate those two things
because you'll see a lot of arguments to
act like
those two things are somehow the same
all right and remember the fairness
isn't a real thing
so here are some people that i would say
are are exhibiting cognitive dissonance
so now you've heard me agree with you on
on what feels fair and what doesn't so
we're so far does anybody have a uh
a grossly different opinion than mine in
the comments
um because i'd be interested if so far
you're disagreeing with me
all right just tell me in the in the
comments we'll follow that all right
here's uh
mike costenza says to me on twitter in
response to my tweet he
he says you always say we can't see our
own blind spots
so in this instance i will help point it
out to you your blind spot is sports
this is cognitive distance that's what
it looks like
cognitive distance is when you go after
one one of the tells it's not the only
one i'll get to the other ones
one of the clear tells is that they go
after the messenger
and completely ignore the argument
and first and second of all what would
make mike think i have a blind spot for
sports
i grew up playing four to five sports a
day
i've watched every professional sport i
can think of
and at various times in my life i
enjoyed it i've had
you know step step kid in sports
i've been immersed in sports as much as
anybody
so what would make bike think i have a
blind spot does he think i don't
understand
what a transgender on a woman's team
would do to the audience
of course i do everybody understands
that we all understand how that would
affect
the entertainment value do i not
understand
that it would be um feel unfair for
a woman or all the women who got you
know
knocked down a level of course i
understand that
everybody understands that mike there's
nothing
even slightly
uh confusing about this situation so
mike's
belief that the reason that he and i
disagree is that i have a blind spot in
sports
which is almost a ridiculous statement
for any adult human
we all understand sports in fact there
are very few things
that you could say everybody understands
so well
it would be hard to think of any topic
that was not so universally well
understood
as sports so this is cognitive
dissonance
because there's no fact challenged
there's no argument given
and his attack on me doesn't even make
sense it's not it's not even a logical
attack
on a person there are plenty of things
you could say about me
if you wanted to go after something
about me maybe point out a time i was
wrong in the past
something like that so that's clearly a
cognitive dissonance
so if you found your the way that you
want to respond is about the person
as opposed to the argument you are
experiencing cognitive dissonance that's
how you can tell
all right here's another one um
so uh arachno kimono qc that's the
twitter handle
says my view though genuinely unsure if
it holds up
uh he says it is fair for lebron james
to compete against me for a spot in the
nba team
because we're both male but it is unfair
for trans athletes to compete on women's
teams
because they're not female so this is
arachno's point of view not mine
so what is that is that a good argument
or is that cognitive dissonance can you
spot it
it's cognitive distance because
arachno has confused facts
for arguments there's no argument here
he's acting like a fact as an argument
and that
he's the keeper of facts both of those
things are absurd
because he doesn't get to make something
of fact just because he put a word on it
so he's saying it's a fact that trans
athletes
are not female that's an opinion
right i i get the reasoning and
if you're going to argue it i'd come
down uh well i don't know where to come
down on that that doesn't matter
the point is that pointing just saying
it's a fact that one is a man and it's a
fact that the other is a woman that's
not an argument
even if you agree with the fact you get
that it's not an argument
saying something is a fact is not an
argument
the reason is not given that's cognitive
dissonance
so if you can't tell the difference
between a fact that might be true and it
might not be but it's irrelevant because
it's not an argument either way
now look in the comments brian says sure
it is
no it isn't you're experiencing
cognitive dissonance
so if you agree with this that's how you
know it's cognitive dissonance
you need a reason and just saying
somebody's a woman
somebody's a man that's either a fact or
not a fact
but it's not a reason do you get that
if that's confusing to you you're
experiencing cognitive dissonance in all
likelihood
all right let's do another one um
lady hawk on twitter says society set up
competitive groups of physical men and
women athletics
so that how athletic athletes have
strategically trained
to compete so that's how athletes have
strategically trained to compete
since the changes being proposed have
the biggest impact on physical women
why not defer to their opinion similar
to your stance on
abortion is that a reason
or is that cognitive dissonance
all right first of all says that we set
things up
with men and women as different teams so
that
athletes have strategically trained
to compete what's that mean
do athletes strategically train to
compete
differently if they think a transgender
athlete will be part of the mix
how how how would they train differently
if they thought someday in the future
they would
it doesn't even make sense everybody
would train in the best
way they could train no matter who their
teammate is
right are you gonna train differently
because uh one is extra strong
well there must be extra strong women
who are competing against women who are
less strong but i don't think they
necessarily
train differently so i'm not sure that
that holds up
you know maybe in some slight way you
chained differently but i can't imagine
that would be enough to
you know move this argument and then
the second part of the argument is an
analogy so i've said that uh
men such as me and again this is just
personal i don't recommend it for other
men
but i've said that as a man i prefer to
keep my opinions on abortion to myself
because of credibility meaning that
in abortion you've got a decision that
no matter which way it goes
no matter which way the law is half of
the country
or some number is going to hate it
and so in that world in which you can't
you can't come to agreement
that just won't be possible it'll always
be disagreement the best thing you can
do
is to have a decision that even the
people who disagree with it say well at
least you made it the right way
you know you used the right process and
the right people were involved
didn't go the way i wanted but i'm not
arguing with the system
so if you can make the system credible
you can survive having deep agreement
that's how democracy works basically and
i've said
that having a man who doesn't have any
special insight into the topic
adding an opinion to it doesn't increase
the credibility of the end point
it decreases it whereas if i knew that
the
laws about abortion were mostly made by
women who
have had babies or could have babies or
are confused with people who could have
babies
then that's a more credible outcome now
the argument about credibility in a life
or death
question of abortion has nothing to do
with sports
the analogy just doesn't fit because in
sports you're just trying to figure out
what works it has nothing to do with
a life and death decision that people
can't sort out so the analogy just falls
apart
and by the way when it comes to
questions of bigotry you don't follow
the majority right
if the majority thought bigotry was
great
should you go with the majority no no
bigotry is the one thing
that the minority can rule right
that's how we got here it's the one
thing where if 20 percent of the world
said
uh i think we should get rid of slavery
and we have the somehow we had the power
to make it happen
it wouldn't matter that it wasn't
popular in the end you'd still be okay
i'm glad we did that
right here's another one
sports boy says it is unfair for adults
to compete on children's teams
because of the strength difference now
do you understand
to which i say uh what
what given that nobody is having the
conversation
about adults competing on children's
teams
it's not really a good analogy because
it's just
a hypothetical absurdity shouldn't we
just compare real things
if we're trying to figure out how to
make the real world work just compare
real things
for example now i know you're going to
say the lebron thing wasn't real
but we'll i don't want to untangle that
right now
and it says women's sports exist because
otherwise women
wouldn't have anywhere to play well is
that true
women wouldn't have anywhere to play
unless it were women's sports
that's just a statement of what
definitions mean
if you didn't have women's sports you
wouldn't have women's sports it's not
even a reason
it's a it's sort of a nothing so this
just looks like babble to me
looks like uh crazy talk all right uh
which would be cognitive distance
here's another one uh slava slavish
slavix i don't know how to pronounce it
on twitter says you're ignoring talking
to me you're ignoring that the ceiling
is what's different between men and
women
what the ceiling in other words
how high they can rise in the sports um
to which i say that's not a reason
that's that's a statement of fact you
could agree with it or disagree with it
but i think we'd all agree with it
that you know men have a for most sports
have a higher
potential but so what
there's no reason here so you see the
pattern yet
the people who gave reasons you can
agree or disagree but they're not in
cognitive dissonance
and the people who when after the
speaker
me probably have cognitive dissonance
the people who couldn't tell the
difference between a fact
and a reason probably have cognitive
dissonance
so those are your your two uh your two
tells look for attacking the messenger
and confusing a fact with a reason and
maybe even not even having the fact
right
um nash vulgai
says to me you're not a sports fan so
you are disqualified from having an
input
in much the same fashion about the
abortion thing to which i say
that's not a reason i'm not a sports fan
so i'm disqualified for having an
opinion about something i completely
understand because i've been a sports
fan
in my past you know extensively
um these aren't even reasons
you can't even agree or disagree they're
nothing's and that's what cognitive
dissonance looks like
ricky says let's talk to ricky ricky
says scott i usually follow your logic
but you've lost me today you are
experiencing
cognitive dissonance in all likelihood
because if i asked you to say a fact
where we disagree you wouldn't have any
and if i said
okay if we agree if we agree on the fact
part
tell me where the reasoning is wrong you
wouldn't be able to do it
um
how much how much effort would a person
put into an argument if they believe
there's a low chance you'll see it well
that that's fair too right maybe maybe
people weren't trying hard enough
but that doesn't look like what's
happening
um all right so
here's where i come out my uh honest
full opinion on transgender sports
there's no such thing as fairness
it's not a standard that you can you can
work to
as soon as you imagine that there is
this thing called fairness
you're sort of in some weird imaginary
cognitive dissonance world there's
nothing like that
there's just stuff you prefer and it's
true
that there are tons of people who prefer
that their
daughters and sisters and brothers and
whatnot do not compete
against somebody that they clearly don't
have a competitive
chance against so if somebody just says
you know
fairness aside we don't know what's fair
and what's not but i just have a
preference for the way things are
i say to them that's a good opinion
people can disagree with it but there's
nothing wrong with it that's just
completely honest i just like it the way
it is
it works for me perfectly good argument
um and
apparently i have to go right now
and i'm going to leave you with that and
i'll talk to you
tomorrow
