[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
better than usual even today fun
stories oh I like my fun new stories you
can like them too if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that only
people who have done illegal drugs could
even understand all you need is a cup or
mug glass a tanker chela steine a Canen
jger flask or vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the no be head of the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sipping happens
now
go
delightful all right well we'll start
with apparently 60 Minutes did a piece
on Elan musk SpaceX I didn't see the
piece but apparently Elon Musk wasn't
delighted with the way they they framed
him here here's what Elon mus said on X
uh about the 60 Minutes
piece he said being attacked by 60
Minutes is like being gummed by a very
old man who forgot to put in his
Dentures gross but ineffective
[Laughter]
I don't know if that's the funniest
thing he's ever
said but it might be in the top
10 that's so good it makes me wonder if
he's hired
writers if if if you had his M as much
money as he did wouldn't you hire a
comedy writer just to you know give you
some suggestions for your post
I that looks like a professional doesn't
look like he wrote it himself which is a
compliment if he did write it himself
all right so uh apparently the people
who made
Doritos uh at least in Spain they've
decided that they'll have a uh the new
face of the brand in Spain will be a
trans
person uh so a a woman
who uh is trans she's a woman now
so now a lot of people say ah why are
you why are you being so controversial I
just want to eat my Dorito chips then
all the
controversy and uh but I don't know is
that is there really a problem with this
because usually you're trying to match
your your product you know with a
sponsor who sort of makes sense for the
product right it's not anybody can
advertise anything
product but uh Doritos when I think of
Doritos I think of things I wouldn't
want to put in my
mouth you can finish the jokes from
there that's all I need I'm just doing
the setups I'm just doing the setups if
you're coming up with a terrible joke on
your own that's on you and I'm disgusted
by all of you oh I'm very disappointed
in you oh look where your minds are
going you're horrible people horrible
people cut it
out well here's some good news MIT
developed a super magnet now you might
say to yourself Scott I am nowhere near
sufficiently nerdy enough to get excited
about a magnet oh but this is no common
magnet this is an MIT special magnet a
magnet like no other magnet and it's a
necessary component of Limitless Fusion
Energy so apparently this is one of the
big big things they needed to solve and
MIT solved it do you ever worry that
America is getting Dumber any anybody
ever worry about
that oh no we're getting Dumber because
it seems like it well let me give you
some
positivity um do you have any friends
who could have created a oh let's say a
limitless energy Fusion battery or not
battery uh
magnet I don't know many people who
could have done this I might know a few
actually but I don't know too
many and I submit to
you that the only people who have
mattered in terms of propelling society
forward have been people like this there
are probably six people at
MIT who will be responsible for I don't
know Fusion Energy
forever you know there's lots of people
working on it so it's it's really a team
effort but these are not normal people
the people solving
Fusion they're not like
us right they're not like us and and the
fact that nobody coming across the
border illegally you maybe you know
can't say for sure but maybe they won't
be at MIT at least this generation next
generation might be in
MIT but are you worried about that I'm
not worried about the
IQ because we live in a world where um
just the top 1% of 1% are inventing
things that change the world it's always
been like that most of the rest of us
are just cleaning the streets and you
know trying to do something that
contributes to society that a lot of
other people could have done too so I'm
not worried about our average IQ because
we got AI to fill in the blanks and we
we still have more Geniuses than
probably anywhere else on Earth at least
at least Geniuses that can do the
creative stuff and they have an
environment where they can do it so we
still got that going for
us
um all right here's here's a story that
couldn't make me happier how many of you
heard me say that someday you'll think
it was silly that you ever believe
believed the scientists could measure
the temperature of the earth and then
tell tell when it's moving a little
bit now without even getting into any
details like I'm no expert in the field
I'm simply a person who's lived in the
real
world I've lived in the actual real
world I've worked for big
companies I've uh you know I've I've
been very involved in politics you know
from The Observer commenter commentator
Viewpoint I've seen a lot of stuff I've
just lived in a lot of different
environments and business models and
situations and organizations and one
thing I can tell you with complete
confidence we can't measure the
temperature of the
earth why did you ever think that was
possible come on do do I need a like a
real scientific explanation of why you
can't do that if you've
lived in this
civilization you should know that
automatically that that can't be done
it's so far beyond what ordinary people
can do even collectively and organized
and and even if a genius is in
charge let's take my earlier
conversation say but Scott you're
talking about ordinary average people
maybe they can't do it but certainly the
top 1% of the top 1% could figure out
how to do it
do you think they're the ones who placed
the
thermometers do you think they invented
the
thermometers do you think they do the
maintenance on them do you think they
check to make sure nobody built a big
concrete parking lot next to it to heat
it up no if there were any Geniuses at
all involved with measuring the
temperature of the earth it might have
been maybe somebody invented something
that is involved with the
thermometers but mostly it's average
people do an average stuff and you think
that the collection of average people
can measure the temperature of the Earth
in thousands of locations with different
equipment that's put in at different
times in different situations some near
heat island some not the complete
changing environment it's that the
temperature the sensors are not in every
place on Earth so it doesn't measure if
there's like a warming thing that moved
by they also they also measure only the
the top heat period of the day did you
know know
that the main thing they're doing is
looking for the high so if you're if
you're let's say a few blocks away from
an airport too far for the the heat from
the airport to be bothering your
thermometer all it takes is for the wind
to change directions for one minute and
the warmth from the airport concrete
just wafts over your thermometer doesn't
last for more than 15 seconds and that's
your high for the day it's a new
high all right so I'm just giving you
some examples I'm just saying that this
is so beyond anything that regular
humans can do measure the temperature of
the Earth but here's the
update uh apparently and thank you Owen
for this uh the there are scientific
experts from around the world in a
variety of fields that are uh pushing
back on peer-reviewed science about
temperatures
and they noted a number of problems
measuring the temperature so there's a
you know things that aren't represented
places they don't measure there's all
kinds of ways the record can get
contaminated from heat from urban areas
which is what I was just mentioning uh
there's Corruption of the data uh
there's a homogeneization thing I don't
even know what that is but some problem
with the data and they said the the
flaws are so significant
uh that when you remove the flaws it
also removes the climate
[Laughter]
crisis oh my God is Trump gonna have the
best third Act of all
time
yeah so there's actually a major move to
look at the science for
thermometers now I don't know that this
has ever happened before there have been
people like you know Tony and other
people who have said there's problems
with them but I don't think there's ever
been an organized move by experts in a
variety of related and important fields
that are kind of saying the same
thing now I think my version covers it
completely you you can look at all the
homogenization in the heat islands and
everything but let me just explain
that
beings were not able to measure the
temperature of the
earth you you just don't even need to
get into the details if you've lived in
the real world you know it's not a thing
by the way how many of you agree with
just the without getting into any
details you would agree we can't measure
the temperature of the Earth for how
many of you is that just really
obvious it's really obvious yeah by the
way I don't know if I don't know if
climate change is happening I don't even
have an opinion on that how would I know
I have I'd have to believe sources that
I find not credible like temperatures
but it doesn't mean it's not happening
so I want to make sure I'm not denying
it I just have no no reason to believe
it that's
different well here's some more good
news apparently the US is really getting
serious now about nuclear energy you
know the regular kind so um apparently
there's some big the house put through
bipartisan legislation bipartisan being
the important part to boo to bolster
nuclear energy it was overwhelmingly
approved it just think about that ju
Just hold this in your mind that a
pro-nuclear energy
bill was passed by our government
365 to 36 just in the house the Senate
would still need to deal with it I think
they have their own bill that you know
might overlap so they have to work that
out so 365 to 36 10
to1 10 to
one Michael
shellenberger for the win absolutely
yeah um you know certainly not the only
one but he certainly made a
dent all right um
so that's good now apparently what it
aims to do is make it easier to build
nuclear power plants by speeding up the
environmental reviews and reducing the
licenses fees basically getting the
government out of the way is that a good
idea yeah yeah is it's a good idea and
it's one that's been a good idea for a
very long time but it took a lot of
persuading to get to this point didn't
it just just think about where we were
when I entered the the field in
2015 nuclear energy was controversial
the left didn't like it the right was
more Pro and now it's 10 to
one bipartisan 10 to
one my God that I would I would say that
the well you know
what I I mean
almost I almost wonder if there's a uh
Nobel Prize involved
here because I don't know what Nobel
Prize it would be but it's almost peace
or technology or
economics the economics one is a weird
Nobel but you know what shellenberger
did touched all three I feel like he
should be
nominated like actually literally and
but I don't know which one because
nuclear power
would go a long way toward creating
peace because we fight over
energy right we fight over
energy so going strong on nuclear power
should be one of the most anti-war
proace thingss you could ever
do how about
economics the the EC basically
shellenberger was arguing not just the
risk but the
economics were were an advantage and now
that's common
knowledge right so economics peace what
about
technology the problem was we had all
these scientists and they couldn't
figure out how to
communicate the risks and the rewards in
a way that that the politicians could
act and then shellenberger fixed it he
fixed it he he gave them a language to
talk about risk and reward in a way that
made sense in a business context text
and there therefore prove the
economics
shellenberger should get three Nobel
prizes peace economics the weird
one um and
Technology because you know you granted
that what he didn't do he didn't do it
as a scientist but he fixed the
science he fixed the science the science
was useless because they couldn't
communicate it
and if you tell me that communicating
the science is not the important part of
science I say sir and ma'am you are
mistaken communicating it is what makes
it
real if you can't communicate it it just
stays in your lab has no value at all
Michael
shellenberger three Nobel prizes for
this
yes do you
agree yeah I I think that's absolutely
within the
realm um yeah know the odds of getting
it are low
but so that's interesting well you might
know the prince of fakes on
xb. a you'll see a lot of uh good AI
content there and uh bri. a asked a uh
one of the AI to look at my book God's
debris and this was a prompt can you
identify the Hypno storytelling
techniques used in this book God's
debris and I guess it's got a 200,000
token context window now if you'd like
to be uh up toate on cool things about
AI one of the things you should learn to
say is how many tokens because I guess
that's a essentially a measure of how
much content you can put into it that it
can process am I right about that I need
a better definition of what that
actually is oh I'm seeing some yeses so
the the size of the tokens that it can
take tells you how much it can handle in
terms of putting a whole book in there
or something
larger okay so 200,000 tokens I believe
is pretty darn big compared to what
we've seen so how did it do now what's
this is the Claude 3 Opus version of AI
the newest
one uh and uh bri. a says that uh some
say it puts gp4 to shame now I guarantee
you that g gp4 could not have done what
this did and I'll tell you what it did
it actually accurately found the
hypnotic techniques that I buried in the
book just think about that I'm sure Chad
GPT could not have done
that all right let me give you um so
it's a long page of out put but I'll
just give you the
um it sort of summarizes it before it
gives you the detail so it found the
pacing and leading and I called it down
by that name it found the nested Loops
open Loops reframing symbolism and
metaphor shifting frames and viewpoints
and Earthly vague language and also by
use of
curiosity now probably if I sat down I'm
sure I would think oh you missed a few
things
this is really
impressive this is really impressive you
know for years I've been saying that I
wrote that book using hypnosis
techniques but nobody knew what that
meant and I didn't really I didn't
describe the techniques but AI just dug
them out for you that is really
impressive I gotta say I did not see
this coming I didn't think anything
would be able to do it
and then here's the
summary this is from the AI it says the
combined effect of these techniques is
to induce a mild hypnotic state where
the reader's mind becomes more open to
considering radically new ideas about
themselves in
reality uh the book aims to guide
readers into higher states of awareness
through an engaging storytelling
experience oh my God that's exactly
right that is exactly right
my God yes um I've told now only the
people who have read the book and maybe
had the experience understand I didn't
write it as a reading
experience I wrote it as a almost a
psychedelic experience and not everybody
will have it of course because we're all
different but some number of people have
an experience like they they had gone to
a different level of awareness and it
was written for that purpose and the AI
actually sees it that's amazing all
right I'm just blown away by that um
have you seen the compilation video of
all the of a number of Trump's uh
critics uh mistakenly using the word
erection instead of
insurrection right somebody put together
a compilation clip and it doesn't yet
include Jake Tapper who did it the other
day but there some uh female Democrats I
think ja Paul and some others who say
erection but but the compilation mean oh
it's TB it's not jaul it's uh TB uh
sorry
and so the funny video Cuts between
somebody saying uh something about
Trump's erection and it goes to a
closeup of Trump trump looking at the
camera and winking you know sort of like
Joey on Friends how you doing it is so
funny it is so funny
well here's another uh another of my
amazing predictions the New York Times
is reporting that people are remembering
Trump uh more positively than when he
was in
office that's right the New York Times
just
confirmed one of my oddest
predictions I said Trump would grow in
um
in likability and uh let's say respect
and generally people would think more of
him the more the longer he was out of
office and the New York Times just
confirmed it
[Music]
boom um I don't want to say everything
I've ever predicted this happen but
starting to look that
way well there is a hobby I have because
I like words I'm sort of a word guy and
persuasion guy
I'm fascinated by the topic of things
which can't be
communicated and there are a variety of
reasons for it but often it has to do
with um people's biases can't be you
know hacked or somebody is
incedible so the little boy who cried
wolf could say the words but could not
communicate that there was a danger
because the little boy was no longer
credible because he always said there
was a wolf when there wasn't one so
there's all weird little pockets where
somebody knows something that would be
really really useful for you to know but
there's no way to communicate it it's
just impossible I'll give you another
example I'm having a back and forth with
a person on X who has an anonymous
profile but seems to be a very serious
person who's done their own research
using some kind of records from the
election and claims to have found
irregularities that you know can be
shown on a spreadsheet that very clearly
look
bothersome but when I say I'm not I'm
not sure I quite understand what you
found he says words I think it's a he
says words the sound all eley but I
don't understand any of
them you know I'll just make this up
this isn't real Bill things like well
but you can see from my numbers that you
can see that the ballot machine counter
was duplicated not
copied and I'll be like I I don't know
what any of that means and then it'll
try again okay but you see instead of
the duplication of the copy machines of
the machines that were run through the
machine that was the copying then there
were the duplicates which shows that
there were and when he's done I'd say
again no idea what you just said I don't
know what any of those words mean but it
looks like he has
something so you know if you didn't try
to dig into it it would look like he's
he he's got the goods to show the
election was rigged now how many people
have said they had the
goods to prove the election was rigged
only to find out they did not have any
Goods whatsoever a
lot so here's the situation Anonymous
account can't trust
that uh sources that he says he could
find but would be hard to give me a link
to and then a narrative of how this
could have happened that I don't know
how to check against let's say somebody
who might say it could have happened
accidentally so I wouldn't have any
competing story what do I do with
that can I boost it I can't boost it
right because if it were if we were
truish or even I thought it was worth
you know seeing if it's true I would I
would you know post it and I'd say hey
what do people people think about this
but it's
uncommunicated I don't know if it's
somebody who found like The Smoking
Gun probably not you know if you looked
at the history of smoking guns in the
election usually they're just
steam
um yeah I'm seeing the comments mer
Garland came out against voter ID
there's only one reason for
that is to allow cheating have you ever
seen a situation where your government
is fighting as hard as possible to make
the election less
credible it's exactly what it looks like
it couldn't be anything else there's no
other explanation there's just no other
explanation all
right so I don't know what's happening
in the election
situation
um did anybody see the weird situation
where um I interacted with with uh an
Arizona
official
um I interacted with an Arizona
official on the question of whether you
know we can know if the election is
auditable and a weird thing happened
that is so common to
2024 so the official said you know
here's why it's all
auditable and I looked at it and said
huh that's the most ridiculous ly
terrible uh terrible explanation I've
ever seen it was so
bad that I actually put Checkmate in my
comment like that'd be rare for me to do
because I just I just destroyed them you
want to hear
how well he was saying that you
shouldn't worry about um electronic
voting machines because 93% of the
precincts in his area 93% of the
precincts use paper
so therefore you shouldn't worry about
you know any tampering because you know
93% of them were using paper
anyway and I thought to
myself why are the people reading this
the Democrats saying that he just
totally SLA me down and embarrass me in
public cuz here's what I commented
back because he said that 93% being
paper is basically
proof that we didn't have any rigging
from electronic voting machines to which
I said that's not what I see proved what
I see proved is that if 93% don't use
them didn't you just prove that there's
no reason to have
them if 93% don't need them and you're
saying that those are
secure what would be the point of having
them now you might say but Scott 93%
don't need them because they're small
precincts probably you know maybe you
need them if there's a higher volume so
that would be just the high volume
places but isn't it the high volume
places that determine the whole election
it's the cities isn't it so if the 7%
happen to be 90% of the
population then it's not an argument
that 93% of the
precincts now have I ever told you that
if you give the number and not the
percentage or vice
versa that you're lying that's how you
know somebody's lying they they give you
a number or a percentage but not both
now had he said 93% of the precincts
don't use them oh and also that's 90%
98% of the
public now if he said that I'd say
that's actually not a bad argument but
he didn't say that he didn't and his
idiot
supporters decided to gang up in me and
say that I've been slapped
down here's my point if 93% of them
don't need them either you're lying to
me about the volume of people who use
the electronic parts maybe the cities or
you've proved they don't that they don't
have a
purpose except
what let me ask that again see if you
can connect the dots if 93% of the
precincts use
paper
what's the purpose of the
machines other than
cheating to me it looks like they're
designed for
cheating because he just said you don't
need them in 93% of the precincts that's
proof that they only have one purpose do
you think he's going to say oh they're
much easier to maintain than
paper no paper is pretty easy to
maintain will you say um
you can count them
faster well I don't see any evidence
that anything's getting counted fast if
it's a if it's a state we care about and
apparently the paper Works in other
countries how come other countries that
also have cities can count them the same
day no that's BS so it's not about the
maintenance being cheaper it's not about
timing is it
about cost
well it's hard for me to imagine that
the digital ones are less expensive
don't they actually create paper
anyway
so if it's not
easier it's not
faster and it's not
cheaper why do they have
machines is it because they're more
credible and we're we're more likely to
believe the
machine no that's the opposite I'm more
likely to believe a piece of paper if
two people are looking at it and you're
holding it in your
hand so it doesn't give us a cost
Advantage a speed
advantage or a credibility
Advantage what could be the reason for
them what what
reason
now does that mean there's no reason for
them I don't know I just know that the
person who should know the answer to
that didn't offer any right the person
who should know the very person who was
arguing with me online should know the
purpose and the point of having
electronic
machines might have mentioned it if that
was the entire argument might have
mentioned why no he actually proved with
his bad argument that there's something
very sketchy going on we don't
understand now the rest of his argument
was just as bad I mean it looked L like
a a child trying to argue with an adult
it didn't look like a fair fight and yet
because it was a little bit complicated
he was able his his critics were able to
um describe it as slapping me down and
completely humiliating
me literally the opposite of that
happened and then a publication called
raw something they they like to hit
pieces on me every now and then they do
a hit piece about how much I got slapped
down do you see how the the the uh left
leing media is so gas Lighty right now
that they can talk about the thing
you're looking at with your own eyes as
if it's the opposite of what you're
looking at and it
works that they could literally murder
me show us show a video of me being
murdered and say look at how that guy
murdered the person with a gun and half
of the people looking at it would say
mhm that's what I see damn L
people well Trump got a big win in the
Supreme Court nine to nothing in the
case of uh Colorado and other states
wanted to knock him off the ballot for
his alleged Insurrection e stuff you
know his raging
Insurrection um so Colorado was the case
but then the Supreme Court seemed to
have generalized it enough that other
states would back down as well and Trump
will be on the ballots now if you didn't
watch the meltdowns on MSNBC and
CNN you really missed a good show
because this is not politics mostly on
MSNBC maybe on CNN to a lesser extent
MSNBC their problem appears to be that
they have a lot of batshit crazy women
and men who don't want to call them out
for it I mean it's just a total mental
health
meltdown
now I think I'm somewhat well I don't
know if I'm unbiased when I look at
somebody like let's say Sean
Hannity I I often disagree with
him sometimes I think he you know
exaggerates or says things that don't
pass the fact check like everybody you
know I'm the same but I never think he
looks
crazy do you know what I mean I would
maybe disagree or it looks like he's
spinning something harder than I think
he should be spun something like that
but he never looks
crazy but when I watch the a lot of the
hosts um on
MSNBC they look a little crazy yeah Elon
mus said TDs is a very real mental
condition and we really hurt ourselves
by not treating it like a mental health
problem I don't think you're helping
your cause to treat all of your critics
like they have a different
opinion it's very literally mental
illness and until we can say that out
loud we're not having a sensible
conversation at
all so let's
see um what do you think happens to the
viewers of MSNBC and CNN who were
listening to the legal experts tell them
that they would win this case and that
Trump would be kept off the ballot only
to find that not even not even the
liberal judges agreed with
that yeah by the way if you haven't seen
the face of
the the Colorado woman let's see if I
can find
that um because she has what I would
call an
obvious she just looks crazy and I think
you could tell from the eyes all right
hold
on where is my
stuff
um if you haven't seen it it is a thing
to behold oh
but here's here's here's not the one
from Colorado this is the uh person from
Maine uh who also wanted to keep keep
Trump off the ballot so I I want you to
show you the picture of the the person
in charge in
Maine
right let's see well we show it to you
one at a time I'll go over to locals
next now look at the
face now does that look
like it looks crazy right isn't that a
red
flag now are there photos of me that are
not flattering but I'll bet you there's
not a single photo of me that looks
crazy and you're going to say to me but
Scott I think you're being a little
sexist no I I say the thing the same
thing about Adam shift and you know
swall well and all those guys but here's
the Colorado the woman from Colorado who
was in
charge I'm not imagining this that those
are crazy eyes look at those
eyes that's it just looks like
insanity now am I going too
far does it sound like this is
hyperbole am I exaggerating for
political no I don't think this is
politics I'm not in the realm of
politics right now this is actually
somewhat
obviously really really obviously a
mental health
problem super super
obviously anyway
um I think that it may be possible that
a lot of Democrats just learned that
they were the baddies but they didn't
know it
not everybody but I think it carved off
you know another
1% because how could you listen to the
news for weeks and weeks and weeks and
they're they're legal experts legal
experts were telling you that Trump
would be maybe kept off the ballot for
all the Insurrection and then 90 slap
down how do the viewers process that do
they understand that they have been
intentionally lied to
what do you think you know when when Fox
News gets something wrong and you know
everybody gets stuff wrong but when Fox
News gets something
wrong it just looks like a
mistake because everybody makes
mistakes but do you think that this was
a mistake by all those legal experts do
you think their best legal experts
didn't know how this was going to go
because I knew I
knew now here there's an interesting
substory to this that even though it was
9 to Zer the four
women uh resisted extending I think I
have this right uh the four women which
would include the one conservative woman
on the court
um wanted to maybe limit the ruling so
it was just about Colorado and maybe um
you know didn't extend to Future
situations that was too
much and the
men presumably were all in favor of
making it a larger ruling to make sure
there wasn't trouble
later here's how I see this this is a
good argument for not letting women on
the Supreme Court because here's what
the women missed but I think all the men
understood you ready for this
by the way this won't be nearly as
sexist as you think this won't be nearly
as
sexist I believe that
men understand they're always at War I
say this a lot but it's really important
men are always at War even when nobody's
doing anything violent or talking
violent we're always at War because the
reason that there isn't a fist fight
everywhere all the time is because we do
the war in our
heads you meet it you meet a larger man
and you say okay you won the war's over
now what do we do now that you
won likewise you know a smaller man you
know if you're the bigger one you know
you
won so here's what I think happened and
I don't think a single commentator got
this
right the men on the Supreme Court knew
it wasn't their
decision and so they ruled the only way
they
could do you know why
because the men understood that there
are too many guns in the country to keep
Trump off the
ballot the
men all understood at a deep biological
level that there was no decision to be
made there were too many guns in the
country to keep Trump off the
ballot so they needed to come up with a
you know legal
which was easy but it wasn't really
their
decision I think the men knew that they
were keeping the country from Bloodshed
and the women didn't understand
that so when the men said let's make
this a sort of a larger ruling that
would affect the future it was a
protective measure that
maybe the women were right it was a
little bit of an
overreach because from their perspective
presumably and again I can't read any
Minds I'm just looking from the outside
so I can be wrong but what it looks
like is that the women didn't understand
that it wasn't their
decision not just it wasn't the women's
decision but it wasn't the men's
decision on the court either the public
had already
decided there were just too many guns in
the country you weren't going to keep
him off the ballot do you know why I
never once worried about this court case
and you would think it would be one of
the big ones you'd worry about if you
wanted Trump to succeed I didn't worry
about it once do you know why there were
too many guns in the
country it wasn't up to the court and I
trusted that at least the men would know
that and apparently they did now if you
ask them they'd say Scott we didn't even
consider that you we we just looked at
the law but that's not how brains work
that's not how brains work
first you decide and then you
rationalize even if you're under the
court first you decide and then you
rationalize that's why we can usually
guess what the votes will be because we
know the conservatives will want
something then they'll rationalize it
the Liberals will either want it or not
want it and then they'll rationalize it
but those things you see as the legal
opinions are not not why they did it
those are rationalizations that they try
to make fit the
law so I believe that at a biological
level the men knew that they were
protecting the country they knew it
wasn't their decision it was the
decision of the men with guns and the
men with guns had already
decided it wasn't going to go the other
way it just wasn't and by the way if you
put J if you put Trump in jail for one
day do you know who would understand the
risk of that the four men
on the Supreme Court or the five men or
whatever it is um do you know who
wouldn't understand the risk of that the
women the women wouldn't understand it
now this is not a bi I'm not going to
say this some biological problem what I
think it is is a lifetime of the women
not having to think in that frame and
the men having to think in that frame
every minute of their life we're always
at War so that you don't have to think
about
it right
if you women are not seeing the war
that's going on all the time then we did
our job that's like some good man stuff
there if you didn't know there was a
war we did a really good job and this is
a good example of
that but uh when you see Keith Alman
going batshit um you know that I don't
think that this is a female only problem
and nothing I say about men and women
means all the men we're all the women it
never means that so when you attack me
later uh you'll be
dumb but I do think we have a huge
problem in the world that they're batsh
crazy women making decisions and men who
are afraid to tell them that they're
batsh crazy because if they can make any
argument that they're still in the
political frame it's hard to call them
crazy even when it's obviously a mental
illness CNN was hilarious um I was
watching a show with is it Laura coats
do I have her name right one of the
hosts and she had two guests on and the
three of them seemed to be in agreement
that Insurrection had been proven by
everybody who ever looked at it I mean
you know all any any official look at it
all proven what were they talking
about where was Insurrection proven was
it where he wasn't charged and wasn't
convicted
where where's all the Insurrection the
the viewers of
CNN
believe the Insurrection is a fact and
the only thing being decided is whether
he should be allowed to run as an
insurrectionist that's what their
viewers actually think happened they're
completely unaware that not only did no
Insurrection happen but he hasn't been
charged with it because it didn't happen
and and they no idea they're they're
living in a completely artificial
World um that's just remarkable to
see and there there are no Democrats who
ever see my content anymore so I can
talk about them with impunity nobody
will attack me yeah so whoever is in
charge of everything clearly it's not
Elon Musk we can see but whoever's in
charge of
everything has somehow cut me off from
the rest of the world so that I only
talk to people people largely going to
agree with
me all right um CBS is being
sued by a white male writer for the Seal
team I guess that's a TV show on CBS and
he's suing for discrimination against
white
men is there anybody who's funding those
lawsuits doesn't it seem like there
should be some fund that you know pays
for the legal fees and stuff that would
be a real useful thing so I know that
Elon Musk will fund people who get
kicked off or lose their jobs and stuff
because of what they posted on a and I
know that there's that American
first thing where they're fighting
various conservative battles but I don't
think anybody's protecting the average
white man who got discriminated against
in employment because it would be like
80 million cases I
think you Elan just tweeted about voting
for a new DA in
Austin that would be uh problem if he
has the wrong da in
Austin all right
um the DHS watched there's a DHS
Watchdog Department of Homeland Security
has a watchdog didn't even know that but
uh the Watchdog is launching a criminal
probe into why the Secret Service
deleted January 6 text message
after there was a subpoena to protect
them there are so many outrages that
this one you know I knew I guess but I
forgot Ju Just hold this in your
mind that probably the group that would
know the most about what the real danger
was and what the situation was the
Secret Service that their messages were
deleted after a subpoena was
issued
um and we don't know who ordered that do
we wouldn't you like to know who ordered
the uh deletion of those
messages and by the way if they're gone
I think all the January 6 people should
be released now I think they should be
released anyway but if anything that
could have been
[Music]
um heading toward their uh let's say
anything that could have helped them in
their case
if it was intentionally deleted by the
government or a government
entity ex you exculpatory thank you
that's the word I was searching for if
there's any exculpatory evidence and the
government deleted
it that should be the end of the
story because we don't know what was in
the text and we don't know if it was
exculpatory but they deleted it remember
the government is guilty until proven
innocence you don't have to prove
Pro that there was something in those
messages that mattered you only have to
know that they deleted them after being
asked not to by The
subpoena that's all you need you don't
need to know anything else you just have
to open the jail door and let those
people out because
the the the the abortion of justice of
this whole Janny R thing is so
outrageous that I can't really even see
other items
in front of me like honestly I only care
that they get freed and the rest I
figure will work out but give me a
president who lets them out of
jail and uh I don't care what other
crimes you do all right next up is the
immunity question uh was Trump uh you
know the Supreme Court will decide was
Trump under presidential immunity when
he did things that other people say are
crimes
now here's the
thing
um whoopy Goldberg made a good point
that the conservatives took an of
context so it turned it into a bad point
but the good point was and she the way
she said it made it easy to take it out
of context but she made a good point
that if you said that presidents have
you know blanket immunity for
everything then Joe Biden could just you
know arrest all Republicans and put them
in jail now it was taken by some people
to mean that she wanted to do that of
course she doesn't want to lock up all
Republicans that that to me she was
getting the Trump treatment where she
says something that's obvious Hyperbole
and then people act like oh you said the
thing you really think no Trump doesn't
want to be a dictator for a day and
whoop he doesn't want to lock up all the
Republicans and I shouldn't have to tell
you either of those things that that's
called hyperbole so uh I defend Whoopi
on her hyperbole perfectly acceptable
and her point was accurate in my opinion
it was a good point which is if you
allowed blanket immunity could a
president do things you didn't want and
you wish you hadn't given them blanket
immunity now that's a good point uh but
there are other good
points uh for example could Biden be
arrested immediately if he doesn't have
immunity well I would like to suggest
something that Joe Biden has done which
seems to me an obvious
crime that uh we should know if he has
immunity and by the way if it's found
that Trump doesn't have
immunity of any kind then I think this
should be pursued so when um when Biden
often says that there's a white
supremacy problem and a magga problem
and then he conflates them that the mag
are away supremacists and that Trump is
Hitler and that uh his supporters are
all
Nazis I I don't think it's a stretch to
say that's a call for violence against a
ethnic group that's called a hate crime
there are laws in the books against that
so if Biden said for
example uh I think all elbonian should
be um rounded up and
shot that would be a hate crime would
you
agree everybody agree right if he said
all elbonian should be punished just
because they're elbonian yeah now he
doesn't have to say just because they're
elbonian he could just
say uh I think we should round up the
elbonian totally hate
crime but he can say that the white
nationalists and white supremacists
which he likes to conflate with ordinary
magga people and then say their leader
is Hitler you're telling me that isn't
really really Direct telling you to do
violence against those people do you
think that if this became a case do you
think that anybody could come up with oh
let's say a bunch of videos that show
Republicans being beaten in public for
wearing let's say a mega
hat oh yes you could oh yes you could
you could find a lot of video of magga
people being beaten up by the general
public at the same time you would
intersperse uh the Biden saying the the
fine people hoax which he knows is a
hoax right now you'd also have to show
that he knows the fine people hoax is a
hoax because because that's which would
be easy to do
um because that's what's kind of central
to his branding of one one side worthy
of
violence now am I how far off am I I'm
no
lawyer but is there a case could a case
be made that he he's using Haze speech
against uh white Americans who are
Republicans yes or no too
far I feel like it's I feel like it's
right in the middle of the target I
don't think it's a
stretch I I think it's very obvious that
he is setting up um one group one ethnic
group that happen to be political as
well he's setting up one group um very
clearly for punishment and retribution
and even violence so if um if Trump is
found not to have any kind of um
protection then I would say we should we
somebody should immediately Institute
charges against
Biden and and it should be the good
stuff right not not just the um the far
stuff well how about the far stuff how
how about a far well that happened when
he was not in office so that doesn't
work all right but there must be
something he's doing that's illegal just
chargeing with all of it now what I
don't quite understand is if the court
can rule that there is a situation where
the president has immunity but he has to
clearly be doing his job and maybe he
has to think it's legal or something
like that you know so maybe there's
something little car Val I don't know
how that
works all
right um I guess we learned that the
Biden Administration flew in 320,000
migrants because if you fly them in they
don't count as border
crossings wait
what this is this this is a report I
don't know if it's
true but uh musk commented on it and
that is obvious to anyone who is not a
fool that this Administration is
deliberately importing vast numbers of
illegals and in other places he said is
for voting
reasons all right somebody needs to
teach them what a Democrat
is they'll all become Republicans it's
not a hard sale it would be the easiest
sale ever hey migrant let me tell you
what Republicans believe in now let me
tell you what Democrats believe
which one are you easiest sale
ever um among all these many people
coming in are uh apparently the FBI is
searching for an Iranian spy who is
plotting to assassinate Mike Pompeo
which would be related to the
Solomon uh killing when Trump was in
office which means that they're looking
for
Trump which means oh
God are they going to kill Trump and
make it look like an Iranian
hit oh
 I I feel like we're getting primed
that if something that we couldn't
figure out how it happened to happen
they'd say well we told you there was
this Iranian spy and if he was looking
to kill Mike Pompeo he was certainly
looking to kill Trump because they
worked together to kill
Solomon
so that's uh
subtable According to axios which is no
longer a real publication but rather
just a Democrat weird piece uh they say
that Biden privately thinks they should
push harder in the election and that
Trump is wobbly both intellectually and
emotionally and he'll explode if B if
Biden mercilessly gigs and gos him and
calls him a
loser so uh Biden thinks if he just
keeps calling him a loser
ER Trump will flip out on
him
maybe maybe it's not it's not his worst
idea we'll see I think the entire race
comes down to can Trump um keep
cool because it looks like he's on a
Glide path and he could only take
himself off by getting
derailed so we'll see they're definitely
going to try to derail him
um Biden wants to take away your uh what
he calls your assault weapons and other
people just call weapons um and he's
doing at the same time he wants to
basically take all your freedom and put
you in jail for your free speech worst
idea I've ever heard in my life um but I
had a realization
today the Second Amendment is probably
the only reason I'm not in
jail
just think about
that that's probably true the Second
Amendment is probably the only reason
I'm not in jail because I would be
considered you know one of many um let's
say enemies of the current
Administration in their mind in their
mind I feel like I'm just
pro-america but why wouldn't they put
their enemies away if they
could what would stop them the law won't
stop them do you think do you think the
legal system would prevent me from going
to jail for
nothing ask the January 6 people asked
Trump no we live in a system we're
putting somebody in jail for whatever
you want is now the law as long as they
can do it in a in an area that has you
know their
prosecutors so if I say something
online I you know it's available to
every state so every every single
prosecutor in every state could put me
in jail for my free speech and the only
thing that's protecting
me is that so many of you have
guns that's it you are literally keeping
me out of jail I believe that in a
literal way I'm not exaggerating I
believe I would literally be in jail if
there were now so many guns in the
country who wouldn't put up with it and
unfortunately they probably would put up
with
it yeah thank
you so the Second Amendment is uh super
important and if he tries to take the
assault rifles away might be some
surprises all
right um there's a British man who's
being sentenced to two years in jail
because he put some anti-immigration
stickers up what would you call an
anti-immigration sticker well the one
shown in the story had the message quote
we will be a minority in our homeland by
2066
um um he's going to jail for two
years now remember when I said I thought
I would already be in jail if not for
the Second
Amendment how is that second amendment
in Great
Britain don't have one so you go to jail
for
talking if you give up your guns you go
in jail for
talking let me say it again if you give
up your
guns they can put you in jail for
talking that's real that is not an
exaggeration and by the
way if they get your long you know your
rifles they're in a lot better situation
to do whatever they want to you so I've
never been more Pro Second Amendment I
think we should add Bazookas to that
all
right so in Great Britain it's illegal
to tell the truth if somebody doesn't
like it because we we will be a minority
in our homeland by 2066 I understand how
somebody sees that as hay speech because
it's you know anti-immigrant
um but it might also be technically
true right 2066 is a it's a ways away
and if the natural birth rate is lower
than the immigration rate and then
the you know the uh birth rate of the
immigrants then 2066 sounds like a
reasonable time to assume that there
would be a switch over in the
majority now the fact that he doesn't
like
that you know sounds
distasteful doesn't like to live in a
diverse place so we don't love that
maybe but um he is welcome to his
opinion or should be apparently he's not
welcome to his
opinion uh Constantine kissen you know
him from his excellent
podcasts um he was I saw him on another
podcast saying do you know how many
people Russia has arrested in the past
year for their social media posts and
the answer is
400
wow wow boy you don't want to live in
Russia do you you try to use your free
speech in Russia 400 people got arrested
for just talking on social media and
saying things Gremlin didn't like 400
wow so it's not like you know some place
like the Great Britain do you know how
many people in Great Britain were
arrested for their social media posts in
the same period
3,300 yeah what's that nine times about
nine times more so if you want free
speech Russia is a better bet than Great
Britain at the moment now I would
caution you not to take those numbers
you literally because I think if you
live in Russia you're smart enough not
to say things on social
media because you know you'll get
arrested whereas in Great Britain people
haven't figured it out they're still
they're still under the impression that
they have free
speech so I think once the uh the Brits
understand that they're in as bad a
situation as the Russians they will stop
talking on social media which is of
course what the government wants them to
do stop talking and uh maybe there'll
only be 400 arrest because there be only
400 who are crazy enough to to violate
that all right uh Elon mus says that
grock will be maybe different from some
of the other AIS and that it will learn
to reason from first principles whereas
the current AIS the language models are
just looking for patterns so if you're
just looking for patterns based on what
humans have done before you're going to
pick up all their stupidity all their
biases and you'll just build artificial
intelligence that isn't intelligent
that's what we have
now so Elon believes that he can create
one that can reason now I don't know if
that makes it a generalized intelligence
that we're talking about or not or maybe
it's a hybrid but so he's trying to do
that and he gives the example of Galileo
if if AI had existed in Galileo's time
it was said Galileo is wrong and uh you
know the the consensus is right that the
sun travels around the earth not vice
versa now um and so he says you know we
got the same problem now so you have to
reason from first principles so that
you're not confused by all the stuff
that's wrong that humans have said
before now on the surface that makes
sense right makes perfect
sense uh onto the surface doesn't work
here's
why we have to come to terms with the
fact that our civilization is built on
lies
primarily not a little
bit
primarily the entire civilization is
held together by a Web of Lies that
we've
decided give us some stability and so we
act like they're
true if you had something that started
tell you the truth we would have to
either kill it or kill the people who
made
it there's no way civilization could
survive anything that we thought was
right and and reason from first
principles we would make it illegal
immediately because it wouldn't agree
with us it would take power from people
and that's never
allowed the people who have the power
will you know fight to kill it in the
courts
so my take is that if you built Gro to
be able to reason from first principles
and then it started saying a bunch of
things that were just clearly and
obviously
true but didn't agree with the
narratives that keep Society together uh
we would see that grocket like a
Frankenstein monster and we would attack
it it would just be too
dangerous now I'd love to be wrong about
that but I'm not
we are not ready for the truth we can't
handle the truth so to speak and uh no
we would kill this thing as soon as we
could um this might surprise you quite a
bit but the talk of a Gaza ceasefire
seems to be running into a
snag huh didn't see that
coming well here's my take on Gaza in
order to have a ceasefire now I think
they were just talking about a ceasefire
to exchange some prisoners and and I
want to give you a little terrible
truth presumably Hamas has released the
prisoners who are the least poorly
treated am I right the ones who hadn't
been tortured those are the ones you
release first as you get toward the end
I don't know how many there left 50 or
some it's possible that of the 50 we
think are left 40 are
dead yeah you know what I mean we think
they're 50 or whatever the number is
might not be it could those could be all
the ones that are dead they might have
nothing to trade or the ones they have
left are in such bad shape from
torture that giving them back would be
worse than not giving them back because
of how it would make people
feel so that's the first problem that
exchanging prisoners is only good until
you get to those last 50 50 and then
you've got a whole new problem which is
you don't really have some healthy
prisoners to exchange so that's one
thing but the bigger thing is that in
order to have a ceasefire that's you
know longer than just for a prisoner
swap um you would need both sides to
want that if one side wants to fight and
the other one doesn't there's no
ceasefire if both of them want to fight
then there's no sea ceasefire but we
have this weird situation where one side
is fighting to win and the other is
trying to lose and they're both getting
what they want at the
moment because every time that Hamas can
print a new higher alleged death count
they win I mean it looks like they're
planning for the future where where
Israel's reputation is destroyed by this
and then Israel won't have as much
support from the International Community
so as long as both sides are getting
what they
want what why would there be a
ceasefire now you can say but but all
the people no the people don't have any
power the the PE the poor citizens were
being starved to death they don't have
any power they can't make a ceasefire if
it were up to them then yes of course
they would but it's up to Hamas Hamas
wants the maximum amount of bad
reputational outcome for Israel and
they're getting it and Israel wants to
win and they
are so somebody's got to want to stop
for it to
stop and it's not going to be the poor
victims who just want to eat they don't
have any
power well the hoodies are cutting
undersea telecommunications cables I
don't it's hard to imagine hasn't
affected as yet because I thought the
whole world was so connected that if you
cut an undersea cable you know somehow
there'd be too much traffic somewhere
else because I think it can all be re
routed it would just be a problem um I
don't know that maybe some of it can
be
but how are they cutting these underseat
cables is that easy to
do like what kind of Technology do you
use oh it's easy just an anchor drag
somebody
says
scissors uh the ship dragged anchors and
cut the
cables where you attack the on land
Building well yeah they're not doing
that they have a submarine somebody says
maybe I don't know um but how powerful
are the hoodies that we can't stop
them like is there nothing in Yemen that
we can blow up to make this stop there's
not a single thing in Yemen that they
really really want to
keep anything there's probably nothing
there that we could blow up that they
care
about anyway so I guess that'll just
keep going the way it's going uh ladies
and
gentlemen this concludes the best live
stream you've ever seen um by tonight it
will be taken out of context to cancel
me I'm sure that's coming but uh they
can try let them
try
um why is Yemen bad oh because the
hoodies in Yemen are attacking the ships
and closing off the main shipping artery
and also dragging breaking some of the
cables so they seem to be working with
Iran seem to be they are working with
the r all right that's all we got for
today and thanks for joining on the xlab
Forum and on Rumble and on the racist
product called YouTube we'll see you
tomorrow same
time
see
