we're up a little bit that's good keep
it up we're going to have a show show us
today you won't believe
it so good you'll wonder why you weren't
doing it every
day uh okay that didn't
work huh all right we've got a new
Wrinkle in our
technology so it looks like
the video is
[Music]
ended let's try that again we'll get
this working any moment
now oh that's
weird so is this working on
locals it looks like locals is not
working what's up with that if locals
doesn't come on I'm going to have to
turn it off so they can get on all right
well it looks like I'm going to have to
start a sear separate live
stream all
right uh don't know why don't know why
probably pushed the wrong
button so I'm just going to start a
separate separate stream
we got two streams
going is one isn't
enough all right ladies and gentlemen
for some reason the locals did not load
on my Rumble Studio I probably pushed
the wrong button so you're going to be
here on a separate feed aren't you
special
[Music]
all right good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
can understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is CPP muger
glass a tanker chaler Stein a canteen
jger flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join us now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopam me head of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now
go oh that's good that's
good all right here's something I've
never done before I'm going to introduce
you to the people on
locals all right here's the locals app
running and it's looking at the rest of
you hey locals look at those other
people in case you wondered what what
are the comments look on the other side
so we got uh two different streams
normally it's one
stream I just I think I pushed the wrong
button this morning
and excluded locals accidentally but
let's talk about all the things there's
a new video of K haris in Hinesville
Georgia it's one of the stops on her bus
tour that's right she loves a bus it's
not even a little yellow bus but she
loves it anyway and uh here's the only
thing I have to say about the video of K
Harris in Hinesville
Georgia she looks drunk to
me so take a look at it it's on my feed
but you couldn't find it and you tell me
if she doesn't look
drunk she her gesticulations are
unusually theatrical and she's got kind
of that face I'll tell you one thing
it's not her regular
personality so if she doesn't have some
kind of a substance problem which to me
looks kind of
obvious
um then we have a bigger problem because
it means she has two personalities so
whatever personality she was showing on
that Hinesville stop it's not the normal
one that's all I'm saying so you you can
judge for
yourself well here's one of the reasons
we love the
xplatform so Stephen King who as you
know is a big critic of trump which
makes him a big critic of anybody who
likes Trump which would include Elon
Musk so Stephen King thinks that this
would be worth his time today this is a
post he made he goes oops SpaceX
launches are on hold after a booster
rocket toppled over in Flames while
Landing
Wednesday
now Stephen King is not ordinarily the
person who's giving you news breaking
news
updates why would he pick this one story
to
highlight remember he's not like a just
a general news guy why because it makes
Elon Musk look
bad he had one thing that didn't work so
he has to point that out what would you
why would you think of Stephen King if
you were Elon Musk well you think he's
kind of a dick right because he didn't
there was no real reasoning had to post
that and he didn't have to put it on the
xplatform and it was basically just to
embarrass
musk so here was Elon musk's response to
Stephen King
dick not only does he call him a dick
and then musk uses his grock AI to
create a humorous uh image of Stephen
King sitting in a pile of money with a
clown behind him with a big eggplant in
his
mouth yep that actually
happened how entertaining is that very
entertaining very
entertaining I continue to like the fact
that Elon Musk refuses to act like
everybody thinks people should
act he only acts the way he thinks makes
sense he just never just conforms to
what you think he should do yeah let's
just call a dick and make a funny
picture about him good now that is
someone who understands the
xplatform from top to bottom right
there here's the weirdest creepiest news
there's according to new Atlas there's
some uh Engineers who are building it
looks like some kind of Italian company
they're building uh let's see the
Italian Institute of Technology who I
call the
instit technolog
because I'm worldly and Global and
stuff so you probably just
say you know the Italian Institute of
Technology because you're so American
not not worldly like me with my good
accents and stuff anyway they've
developed a uh flying toddler robot to
rescue people now you might say to
yourself robot that's a good idea to go
res rescue people yeah a rescue robot
that's good then then they made it
better they made it a flying robot
literally they're going to put a jetpack
on a
robot and you say to yourself now we're
talking are you kidding me a jetpack on
a rescue robot yes Robot Man time Tony
Stark yes this is going to be the most
awesome robot we've
ever wait what does it look
like they've made it look like a
child so has the face of a Todd
and it's
smallish it's not toddler size but it's
smaller than an
adult why they have to make it so
creepy you should see this damn thing
it's the creepiest looking robot you've
ever seen I could just imagine myself
trapped in a burning Forest broken leg
I'm laying there well I guess this would
be my arm not my leg I'm laying there
and I'm hoping for a rescue and all of a
sudden in the sky I
see sh I'm like yes yes it's my rescue
robot come come to me rescue robot and
the rescue robot
comes lands there and you see that it
looks like a creepy
toddler well I would get up and start
running toward the flame because that's
a scary image a flying robot toddler
with big
eyes that looks like Adam shiff just
leaving the skiff no thank you I'd
rather burn in the forest
fire no I do want a flying robot very
much all right uh there's a story that
you can't make me care about I'll just
I'll just mention it so that you've all
heard it so you don't say why don't you
mention that story Scott it's because I
don't care about it it's the biggest
fake political story I me it's probably
based on some facts but the story is
that uh you know Trump went
to uh do some event some photo op at the
Arlington National Cemetery but the
cemetery has some rules about
photography and who can be there and so
they some people in charge were trying
to prevent them from doing a big
campaign photo op because you're not
supposed to do political things at the
cemetery I understand that I don't
care I don't care that Arlington had
some rules I don't care that the Trump
campaign might have bent them or broke
them I don't care that somebody took
some photographs nobody was trying to
hurt
anybody can we agree on that nobody had
any bad
intentions the visit to the Arlington
Cemetery was about honoring falling
fallen
heroes maybe somebody brought a
camera you can't make me care about this
no
if people are showing their respect to
Fallen Soldiers at a cemetery that is
really designed to respect Fallen
Soldiers you can't make me care that one
of them brought a camera I'm sorry I'm
just not going to be involved in that
story but I mentioned it just you know
because it's going to be on the
news anyway there's a study in a King's
College London that says that uh people
cannot anticipate opposing views meaning
that people know what they think and
they know what people who agree with
them think but if they try to guess what
people who have different opinions think
not so good so it turns out that people
are terrible at understanding how other
people think now I've been
saying that I think at least in America
the Republicans have a better idea what
Democrats think than Democrats have what
Republicans think because the Democrat
view of things is the universal the one
that everybody sees and then the
Republican view is the one that usually
only Republicans see so the least the
Republicans see both sides it's a
general thing right not every person but
maybe it's uh maybe it's worse than I
think so I would love to know if I'm
wrong about this I'd love to know if if
you could actually do a test and you
tested Republicans and Democrats you
know some randomly chosen group and find
out which one knows more about what the
other team
thinks my assumption and observation is
that the Republicans would win their
hands
down but maybe not well I'm open to the
possibility that neither team would be
even
close because there is a lot of mind
reading that goes on on the Republican
side a lot of it is you know they just
want power and yeah they the WF and
they're in charge but no somebody else
is in charge so Republicans have a lot
of you know theories about who's in
charge and what people are thinking that
I don't always line up
with but it does make me wonder if if I
could be wrong by the way this is a good
um a good hygiene tip for your
brain if you can't occasionally say to
yourself huh I had a strong opinion this
way but what if it's completely wrong
and then you just allow yourself to
imagine that your opinion that you've
held kind of strongly and you've even
said publicly what if it's totally wrong
so that's what I'm doing right now I'm
modeling that so I think I'm right but
I'm AB I'm completely open to the fact
that nobody knows what the other person
thinks just universally could be I
wouldn't rule it out all
right did you know that there are a lot
of scientific papers that reference
other papers because that's very common
in science you say well this was true
with this paper and we're building on
that or we're extending it or whatever
did you know that there are a whole
bunch of papers that get referenced that
got
withdrawn but the paper that references
it doesn't
update so you have a situation where
there are lots of you know papers
scientific papers that could be
peer-reviewed that make reference to
other studies that all were also
peer-reviewed at one point but as those
other studies get withdrawn because it
turns out they don't hold up the paper
that references them doesn't get
updated so what we have is a situation
where
there um there are
hoaxes that are referencing other
hoaxes now I'm using the the word hoax
you know to hyperbolically is just stuff
that's wrong but so science is now a
nested it's like the uh the Russian eggs
you know it's like a hoax inside are a
hoax it's like the original paper is a
hoax then there's a new paper that
references the old hoax and then other
people reference them too so you have
thousands of people referencing a thing
that didn't happen and then the thing
that didn't happen gets debunked but the
other stuff
stays now you can sort that
out but it's a big problem so I only
like to point that out because when you
say that science has decided something
maybe it hasn't we've got a little bit
more skepticism about science coming up
on this
show all right the telegram CEO that pav
durov so he's been officially indicted
he bail has been set at a affordable
price for him anyway and he's on a
supervised release he's prohibited from
leaving France what do you think a
supervised release
is what's that mean supervised release
does that mean he has to check in does
that mean he's wearing a ankle
bracelet or does it mean that all of his
Communications are being uh
monitored my guess is that all of his
Communications are being monitored and
he probably has to check in pretty often
to make sure he didn't get it on the
plane
so um but the new wrinkle is that the
UAE who I believe is his country of
residence at the
moment um is pushing hard to get him
released so it turns out he's good
personal friends with I think the the
prince who might be the number two in
the country or something and so he's got
he's got good friends at the top of the
UAE and they're pushing to get him out
here's what you here's what I can tell
you for sure about this big uh confusing
situation we will never know why
anything is happening we will know what
happened in some cases and we will know
who's involved in some
cases but we're never going to know what
this is about do you agree this is not
the kind of story where it starts out
foggy but then later the details come
into focus and then we all understand
the story we're not going to ever get
close to this
one we're we're just talking about these
surf see things they let us see we don't
know what's going on at all the most the
most logical oh yeah in the UA is
putting some Financial pressure on
France they had a I think they had a big
purchase of uh aircraft that they might
put on hold so the UAA is pushing pretty
hard
but I do think that the thing that is
most likely to be
true is that everybody wants to control
the telegram app and that's probably the
one thing need to know and then
everything else starts to look like it
makes
sense all
right um so the FBI was talking to
reporters yesterday and the newest
update is they have not yet determined
the motivation for the 20-year-old
Thomas Crooks who took a shot at the
president and nicked his
ear um they say don't know the
motivation because they they found he
was not initially fixated on any one
political figure huh and they also say
that he learned bom making starting in
2019 so it wasn't a recent thing for a
years he's been studying bomb
making so isn't that convenient let's
see the information comes from the
FBI and the two updates are suspiciously
good for the
FBI because it would indicate that
nothing has gone to well and good for
Democrats I suppose because it would
indic that has nothing to do with the
rhetoric of the Democrats but rather
there was just this one Disturbed
individual who really didn't care who he
took a shot at could have been a
Democrat could have been Trump so don't
even think it's anything about what the
media saying that or anything like that
do you believe the
FBI now I think you know we all say the
obvious thing most of the people who
work at the FBI are just good CI and
Patriots and you know you'd love to have
them as
neighbors but we do have some questions
about the leadership of the FBI from
time to time and this is one of them
isn't it interesting that uh the two
stories are just good for the
FBI because it sort of absolves them and
absolves the Democrats from any danger
I'm going to say I don't believe
anything about this report doesn't mean
it's wrong so I'm not saying they're Li
Ling I'm saying I wish I had a source
that I could trust I totally don't trust
the FBI on any of this at
all so it's like nothing
happened meanwhile Jim
Jordan uh the uh he's uh he's asked for
uh the CEO of uh that company that uh
judge M's daughter works for
as you know judge Manan one of the Trump
law Affair judges and not not too
friendly to trump it
seems uh as a daughter that is a
consultant to all the people who would
like Trump to be in jail Democrats in
other words and so Jim Jordan wonders if
uh the judge had any conversations with
the company that his daughter worked for
that would tell you something
like a conflict of interest was
happening now I don't think that they
have a Smoking
Gun uh and the company laughed and said
uh no we don't communicate with the
parents of our
employees which is actually a really
good
answer so they put it in the form of you
know basically laughing that they would
be communicating with the father of one
of their employees and I have to say
that's a good response now I'm not
saying that they're not that they
haven't communicated But to answer
answer in the form of any company that
would you know why would you ever have a
conversation with some one of your
employees fathers this it's just not a
normal thing so that's a good defense I
don't expect anything's going to command
of it even if they did have some
conversations probably nothing that they
could find on paper
so I don't think that'll come to
anything but I don't mind that Jim
Jordan's looking into it seems like it's
more political than
well in Michigan they're recommissioning
another closed nuclear power plant
they're still thinking that's it's
easier to to spin one up even though
it's been closed a long time but Japan
has the same problem um basically all
over the world people are finding that
uh we better get these nuclear power
plants up and running as fast as
possible so nuclear could not be hotter
as a as a topic so I just like to bring
that up so it doesn't sneak up on you
we're we're really going to have a lot
of nuclear in 20 years it looks like it
takes a while so the the difference is
if you try to uh recommission one that's
closed even if it been closed a long
time you might be able to spin it up in
say two
years whereas if you tried to build one
you're looking at 10 to 20 years so it
makes sense to open them all right so um
I believe maybe it's today that K Harris
and her emotional support mammal also
known as her vice president running mate
walls will be talking to Dana Bash at
CNN we don't know when it would be
released but we think the interview
would be now would be taped um here's my
favorite part you know the all the
pundits are speculating that the reason
for having the VP in the meeting is that
he's there to keep kaml har
from saying something that would be
embarrassing or dumb or otherwise take
her out of the r now I'm trying to
imagine what that would look
like because I can't my brain can't come
up with a scenario where he could
help imagine this KL Harris gets asked a
question and she's butchering it so
she's like um well we uh do the thing
and what what is her vice president is
it going to do he's sitting next to her
watching her die answering a question
wrong and just like babbling through it
what's he going to
do you know what he's not going to
do he's not going to
mansplain he he is not going to jump in
so I think people were assuming that he
would sort of jump in and and and answer
the question that's a hard question that
maybe he could answer better than she
could no way
no freaking way is that guy going to cut
her off nope and I think he'd have to be
really really really
careful um is it this Thursday or next
Thursday I'm hoping it's
today but there's no way he's going to
mansplain the first uh potential Vice or
first potential woman president who's
also a person of color
how can he how could he possibly say
well let let me explain what KLA is
butchering with her explanation uh I'd
like to say it in the white guy good
explanation way so you can understand it
for the first time so kamla do you just
sit there quietly while I do your job
and show that you're
unqualified that's not going to
happen so I don't know what exactly he's
going to do but he's definitely not
going to interrupt to give a better
answer if he does it's
over it's
over I'm going to introduce a uh a new
hypothesis that I think I said in my man
cave live stream last
night that we we believe that kamla
doesn't want to do the uh you know the
interviews and stuff at least a regular
interview you know not not one where she
brings an emotional support animal with
her
but um that Scott Jennings uh frame by
the way the emotional sport animal
that's one of the funniest reframes I've
heard all year so Scott Jennings home
run good job anyway here's my
hypothesis I don't think that they're
keeping her from talking to the Press
just because she's not ready meaning
that they need to solidify what their
policies are and make sure she can talk
to and you maybe practice a little it
could be that so it could be just no
real reason to talk to the Press getting
ready they'll do it later so it could be
just completely ordinary reasons that
everybody could
understand I think it's something
else I think that she has um a real
fear of ruining everything with one
wrong
word I think she has a little bit of you
know social anxiety about speaking in
public but I think she's in a situation
that we can't even imagine imagine
you're a Democrat and you believe that
Trump is
Hitler and that the only thing that
would keep Hitler from
rising is
you let's say you're K Harris you think
it's now your job to stop
Hitler and you've got uh one debate
planned and you know that if you do a
good job in the debate you might be able
to stop Hiller but if you have one
babbly wrong moment that becomes the
viral
clip you're the person who let Hitler
take over now of course jump is not
Hitler but remember they've all
brainwashed each other into thinking
they're stopping Hitler so put yourself
in this position let's say you're not
the most comfortable public speaker
right that's something that wouldn't
bother Trump but I do think Harris has a
little bit of social
anxiety something she's obviously
overcome in the course of her public
work so she's easily overcomes it she
she shows up event she talks to groups
of people so it's not like it's
crippling but imagine you had the added
pressure of being one of the worst
public speakers just in terms of making
sense and you knew that one wrong
sentence during the
debate could change the world and just
turn it into like Darkness according to
the Democrat narrative which is nowhere
near real but they believe it think
about that
pressure I think that the pressure on KL
Harris to get it right would be like no
other president ever because no nobody's
ever convinced themselves that they're
trying to stop Hiller they're just
trying to win an election if the other
person wins it's not going to be that
different but that's not what they think
now so I think that uh her anxiety about
the debate is probably something that we
can't even imagine it's it's just got to
be through the roof I mean it's
basically her job to save Civilization
by not saying something wrong and she's
kind of famous for not saying things
elegantly
so imagine just imagine yourself in that
situation it would be the scariest thing
you could even
imagine anyway that's my theory that
she's scared to death of getting it
wrong
um so uh there's new new poll L of Fox
News that basically all the Battleground
States or the sun Bel States just the
sun Bel ones the haris is you know tied
but they're within the margin of error
okay can somebody answer this question
for me
how is it that every single adult in the
United States could have told you what
the polling would look like today no
matter who
ran what's up with that if I if I had
asked you all right a year ago all right
it's going to be a few months before the
election and I don't even know who's
going to run let let's say I didn't uh
what will the polling look like two
months before the election you could
answer that question you'd say it looks
like like a tie right or at least it'd
be within the margin of error of the
polling wouldn't every one of you know
that why do we know
that that's not even possible it's not
possible that we could all know
it normally somebody gets something
wrong this is the only thing I've ever
seen where 100% of adults would say oh
yeah it's going to be basically a tie
when the election happens how is that
that possible I mean really how is that
possible here's what I think just a
hypothesis I think that the news is now
so good at
brainwashing that even without planning
to do it they know when to dial things
up and dial it down to make the race as
close as possible so while it looks to
us on the surface like it's two
competing Fields you know the the right
leaning press versus the left leaning
press and they're they just pick their
Champions and they're fighting each
other I don't know if they
are maybe what they're doing is they're
both turning their dials to make sure
it's as close as possible even not
thinking of it intentionally it might be
a completely subconscious process where
they just sort of know that they got to
pull up the pressure or take down the
pressure or they can Coast this week but
that they all are following
money and following the money says it's
got to be closed
that's what keeps us
interested
right so I always tell you that the
follow the money
hypothesis just works all the time even
when it shouldn't that's the fun part
that following the money as in the money
will tell you what the future is going
to bring that it works even when you're
positive it
shouldn't here's one of those times I
believe that the Press just follow
profits as subconsciously if not
consciously is just turning the dials to
guarantee that it's close and they would
have done it with any two
candidates there is no correlation
between policies and polling right now
and we know that because people are
saying uh what are comm's policies we
don't even know but we're happy to vote
for it because I don't know why I guess
I got
hypnotized so you're seeing a
brainwashing operation work
work
perfectly there is no way this
is organically
tied it can't happen I mean just
statistically this couldn't happen on
its own it just can't happen on its own
it's got to be
brainwashing right come up with you come
up with another hypothesis of how we of
how 300 million people could have
accurate L guessed in advance the
polling without even knowing the
policies and without even knowing the
candidates and we all would have nailed
it what's the other explanation for
that I don't know of one I mean unless
it's just the weirdest coincidence in
the
world all right um according to the
Daily Caller there's a hiring process in
the government called uh schedule a
and you can use this it was designed to
make sure that uh the government was
giving you full uh full uh let's
say full
consideration to some hardto hire groups
so that would be that would include
people with intellectual disabilities
severe physical and psychiatric
disabilities so just making sure that
the government can maybe cut some
Corners if they're you know trying to
make sure that everybody's got a shot at
a job makes sense uh but but there was
something in there that said that for
Specialists if somebody has a special
skill then you can also use that
schedule a and it kind of bypasses some
normal hiring Pro processes and maybe
some
approvals and that the so the Daily
Caller says that the Biden
Administration is using it to basically
uh staff the Department of Justice with
a bunch of Democrats
now I hope that they're using the uh
that these are the specialist positions
and not that they're all they all have
intellectual disabilities but they have
uh hired for example over a 100
immigration
judges um through a process where they
wouldn't have a normal approval
process so they're
basically rigging the government rigging
the department of Justice by using a a
trick to get people who wouldn't
necessarily be hired
otherwise so that's
terrible but not as terrible as this
there are at least two places in the
United States where Venezuelan gangs
have captured and are holding
territory one is uh
Denver and the other is
California there there's a some some
kind of apartment housing area where the
Venezuelan armed gangs just took it over
and they're holding
it it's not that they took it over
because you could imagine bad things
happen until they get corrected they're
holding the
territory in Denver as well they've
taken over some real estate and they're
holding it with arm with armed
people the United States is actually
smaller because whatever is happening
within that territory that they hold
that's no longer the United
States it's not like somebody just did a
crime they're controlling territory they
actually stole part of the United States
because there's there's no Department of
Justice in there in their held territory
there's no America police
force that's Venezuela
now we have two parts of America that
are
literally venezuel and
controlled CU we don't have I don't know
the will or the resources to stop it I
guess now I like to think we will stop
it but I thought that when there was
only one place that Venezuelans were
capturing and
holding now they have
two it's probably more than
that
wow um I think it'll get corrected but
let let me let me go back to my prior
point about the poll being a that the
polling says the race is a tie just
think about
this the border is so open that armed
Venezuelan criminals are holding
territory in the United States and the
election is a
tie
really
really foreign Nationals have captured
an our holding territory in the United
States and the election is a
tie what how how is this even a little
bit possible again it's massive
brainwashing it's the only way you can
get here you couldn't get to this
place without massive
brainwashing so that's that's the
explanation for everything well as you
know the Biden Administration has tried
a bunch of things to cancel a bunch of
student debts and conservatives and
courts and uh America First and other
groups have sued and tried to prevent
these things and you know that story is
getting a little boring for me but I'm
going to take it up a
notch uh instead of the government
paying off student
debt and that seems very unfair to all
of
us how about
this how bet the government pays off all
Consumer Debt all of it your car loan
your house loan your entire mortgage all
of your credit
cards all at
once how much would that cost well the
current debt of the entire United States
is around $36
trillion there's no way we'll ever be
able to pay that back or
survive if you were to pay off all the
Consumer Debt it would be another $17
trillion on top
what's the
difference what's the
difference if you can't pay it back and
you're doomed you might as well enjoy
the ride so you might as well just
remove all debt just to you know one
time ever kind of thing make sure
everybody knows that they can't run up
some more debt because you're not going
to ever do it again so it' have to be
you know very clear it's once once
only what would happen well imagine that
the $17 trillion of debt was taken away
from consumers what would they
do they might upgrade their
house they might be able to consume more
because they don't have to pay the
banks you would have this massive
growth that maybe would give you a
better chance of paying off the debt
than if you hadn't done
it here's here's what I know for sure we
don't know anything about economics
you if if you say to yourself but Scott
that's obviously a bad idea to pay off
all Consumer Debt is it where's your
study it it would massively boost
consumer spending which is usually the
driver of the
economy are you telling me it wouldn't
work why would it work to uh forgive
student debt why is that the special
magical debt what makes that magic
what if if if um if taking debt away
from people who are buried with debt is
a good
idea why is it just for
students see the thing is if it pays for
itself and by the way I think it might
it might actually pay for itself um I'm
not sure anybody's smart enough to know
if if the government spends money to
make
money I'm not I don't hate that let me
give you another
example you probably heard the story
that California is going to make money
available for non-citizens to get homes
and you said to yourself what
noncitizens to get homes this is crazy
but then you look at the details and the
details are they're not giving you the
money you have to pay it back when you
sell the
house so if you get into a house and
housing prices go up over time and
you're paying down your loan you built
up some Equity but if your Equity gets
to the point where it's the same amount
that the you know you were given and you
sell the house you've got to pay back
the
loan so the government gives nothing
because they're getting it back now
remember the these are only uh borrowers
they might be non-citizens but they
still have to qualify as qualified
buyers who can pay back a loan just like
everybody else so most of them would
accept the
money someday when they sold the house
the government gets it back and I assume
that would happen even if they died and
there was an estate situation um but on
top of that the government would take
some percentage of profit in the
increase of the value of your
home so if your if your house doubled in
value when you go to pay back the loan I
think you pay back twice as as much as
you got because your house went up in
value some calculation in that
neighborhood so the way it was
designed is that if everything worked
perfectly and the the loan defaults were
just sort of a normal 2% or whatever
that the government would probably make
money it would actually legitimately be
an
investment now it would take a long time
for the money to come back so you got to
you know discount that and calculate it
all but at least there's at least the
model this suggests you could get some
back so I do like anything that the
government does that they've at least
calculated they could make a
profit you know I'm I'm much less
opposed to that kind of spending if if
the if it looks like oh that's got a
good return on investment not in the way
that K Harris says
it so just think about it I I say this
more as a uh by the way this is more of
a mental experiment
if you can tell me why we shouldn't just
get rid of all Consumer Debt I'm open to
that I'm not saying this is a great idea
I'm saying that if the concept of
getting rid of student debt makes
sense and we have no hope of paying back
the debt
anyway why not give everybody a break
and we'll enjoy the ride to
Doom all right so I'm not 100% serious
about this
it's just that if you don't understand
why it's a good or bad idea then you
don't probably don't understand the
whole the whole um topic and I don't I
don't understand if it's a good or bad
idea so I don't understand the whole
topic but I'm sure nobody else does
that's the word that's my problem I
don't think anybody does understand the
national debt and what the what the real
implications are and where that's
going all right according to news Max
82% Americans are considering delaying
retirement I don't even know how anybody
would
retire here's
why um people who have a good jobs and
they have the ability to not retire are
thinking to themselves some version of
this whatever I used to think I needed I
might need 10 times
more so they're not not going to quit
because the value of money might just
decrease to the point that whatever
you've saved you'd better have a lot
more so so every year you work get you
more of what you want but on top of that
I think there are going to be so many
people who can't work either because
robots take their jobs or one reason or
another that the people who can work and
can add to the the economy we're almost
obligated to do it that's what I feel I
I feel that because I'm physically
capable of working and physically
capable of adding to the economy that
retirement would be unethical in my case
does that does anybody feel that like in
theory I have the wherewithal that I
could just stop working and you know
just do whatever I want all
day in practice I feel like if I re if I
just retired I would become a drain on
the system in instead of a a benefit and
I can't do that like my brain won't let
me be a drain on the system if I have
the physical ability to be the opposite
of that and add to it because we're
going to need a lot more margin of
safety than we have because we got some
big stuff coming you know the robot in
AI age we don't know what that's going
to do so those of us who might have some
you know extra resources we're going to
need extra extra extra resources because
there going to be people who need it
whether you like it or not whether it
gets taken by taxes or you're just
helping your family who's not doing so
well one way or another the people who
can make
money feels like an obligation to do
it so that's I'm just speaking
personally that uh I feel like retiring
just wouldn't be morally and
ethically appropriate as long as I can
still get up and do what I do
so I guess I'll keep doing it for a
while well I was impressed that some
Democrats are making a good argument for
why you don't need to see the policy
details for
Harris are you ready for this what would
the what possible argument could you
make that says you don't really need to
see the policy details do you think they
can do it before I tell you what the
arguments are do you think that you'll
just laugh at them like okay that's just
that's just
stupid Let's test it are you he the
argument uh that the point of being
having detailed policies now we all know
that the details of any policy get
worked out through Congress and lots of
negotiating so even if a candidate had a
specific
policy there's no reason to think that
that is going to become law it's that
everything gets negotiated
so Democrats say that the purpose of
having specific policies as a candidate
wait for this is to highlight their
values and I say huh okay that so far
I'm with you that the reason to have
detailed policies such as build a wall
is so that you can understand the values
so Trump says build a wall and then I
say oh his value is he wants to really
protect the border the details
wall no wall whatever it is but he wants
to protect the border so I think yeah
actually that makes sense and you can
see some democrat um policies where you
say all right that's not exactly what's
going to happen probably but you can see
that they're you know valuing this
community we valuing this this
thing and I said to
myself I hate the fact that that makes
complete sense so here's the second part
of it the reason for detailed policies
is just so everybody understands their
values and we're already in a values
race that's that's the
killshot the point of individual
specific policies is just to say where
you're
heading but we're already past that
we're already into the it's very clear
what kamla Harris cares about it's very
clear what Trump cares about we've
already passed the need to have specific
policies
now that's a little
conceptual you have to sort of think
about it for a minute but if you think
about it I agree with that there's
probably no reason for specific policies
that do you know who wants specific
policies the press the Press wants
specific policies they have something to
argue about and
criticize but if you were to talk to the
citizens not the not the ones like me
who are you know following the news and
we're we're news nerds but just an
average person and say do you need
details of KL Harris's policies or do
you feel like you generally know which
way she's
leaning I think
95% of Democrats would say you know what
I don't really need that
details I know she wants to raise the
taxes on the wealthy
Jack right I know she wants to be you
know a little Kinder On the Border but
still add some
security Jack
I don't think they need the details I
think it's just the press and and the
Nerds like me who would care but the
public doesn't care so here's another
one only a dozen podcasters care about
the policy details so this is also
Democrats defending the lack of details
yep you're right yep it's the podcasters
who care so we have something to talk
about you're you're totally right if I
were just
voting I'd feel like I knew
enough but as somebody who talks about
it every day I was like huh give me
something to talk about want
something to talk about but I don't need
it I mean it wouldn't change my
vote so I mean it and then you look at
it say the tax policy so Comm Harris's
tax
policy probably just gave people reasons
to not vote for because the people were
going to vote for may have liked it but
they were going to vote for her there
were certainly people who had a lot of
wealth who don't want to see a wealth
tax so every every policy detail she
gives is bad news for her he gives
people a reason to say no but doesn't
really increase the reason to say yes
try to think of any policy that she
could have that would make people say oh
now I'm on that team I don't know what
that would
be I can't think of anything so really
they don't have much reason to give us
policy details and they say they're
focusing on a vision of the future and
their priorities is more important I
agree right I hate to say it Democrats
have succeeded and convincing me in a
perfectly reasonable not just
persuasive but my sense of Reason agrees
yeah they don't really need it it's just
something that I
want uh wasn't really expecting there
would be a good argument for not having
policies but there it is it's pretty
good um Nicole
Shanahan as you know she's RF she was
RFK well I guess she still is RFK Jr's
running mate because technically his his
campaign is still active is he's just
not
campaigning anyway she said that
Democrats have lost their soul she said
that during a Fox news interview they've
lost their soul they've lost their
Direction that's that's perfectly
said because again if you get into the
details of stuff um you know you could
argue all day but the bigger picture is
they do seem to have lost all interest
in free speech and transparency and
citizens picking their candidates and
all those things that you think would be
part of the historical Democrat Soul
they don't seem to be interested in
anything but winning and keeping Trump
out of office so yeah I think they went
from you know who they are to who Trump
is oh that's a good way to say
it well I often say that the things you
do are what make you who you are it's
not your thoughts it's what you do so
you can have bad thoughts but you're not
a bad person if you don't do bad things
if you have bad thoughts but you only do
good things that are good for other
people well you're a good person that's
how I see it and I think that Democrats
no matter what their internal thinking
is they've gone from who are you well
who do you want to be well I'd like to
be a person who's in favor of peace and
prosperity and you know everybody gets a
shot and that's who you want to be but
that's not what this race is this race
is about Trump
so if the race is about trump it the
Democrats have completely abandoned the
question of of who do you want to be
like do you want to be a person who acts
this way and supports this things and
you know when you die you'll say that's
who I was or do you want to die saying I
stopped Trump because that's not exactly
who you are that's more about him so
yeah it does feel like they've lost
their soul in the sense that they've
lost
introspection there it is that's what
I'm looking for uh I'm not one who
believes in Souls per se but in terms of
um poetic language it's perfect they've
lost
introspection which is very close to
what Nicole is saying that they've lost
their soul they're not really thinking
about who they are and who they want to
be they're just thinking that they got
to stop Trump because somebody told them
he's he's the
devil well did you know that there's a
uh let say there's a taxpayer funded uh
AI thing according to reclaim the net
that they use AI to uh identify
misinformation about
vaccinations and so that they can
inoculate you digitally and information
wise against any wrong think about
physical inoculations
that's right so you are now being
inoculated against
inoculations literally you're being
inoculated information Wise by them you
know blocking or um essentially blocking
uh sources of information they would
consider
Incorrect and that is for the purpose of
you not being uh afraid to get a
vaccination which in theory would
inoculate you from a disease so they're
actually inoculating you from
information to to make sure they can
inoculate your body that's a lot of
inoculation maybe too
much anyway so I got curious because I
was looking at an article in the hill in
which they had this sentence it wasn't
about inoculations but this is how the
hill describes Kennedy so see if this
Rings true to you quote Kennedy who has
long pedal debunked antivaccine
conspiracies is that
true has canity long pedal debunked
antivaccine
conspiracies well if you hear him tell
it he'll say you know it needs to be
studied there's a correlation between
especially autism and some vaccinations
needs to be looked into the vaccines
have not been tested sufficiently so
that would be an obvious place you look
to for making sure that they're safe now
is that a claim that's
debunked well I asked g chat GPT to
explain who debunked him because I
wasn't sure who did the debunking that
matters doesn't it so it turns out there
are some big serious entities that have
completely debunked the idea that
childhood vaccinations would be more
dangerous than good now notice how I
said that what I didn't say is that
Kennedy says the vaccinations give you
autism I haven't heard him say that but
I think people are are suggesting that
he's too close to that line I think he
just wants to know more because there's
a correlation that's really worrisome
and there is there's a correlation that
seems worrisome but did you know it's
all been debunked and here's according
to chat gbt who debunked it first of all
there's the CDC
oh okay well we don't really trust the
CDC do we are you with me so
far I don't trust the CDC do you so if
the CDC says it's debunked does that
have any credibility with you
whatsoever not with me but they're not
the only ones I mean there's lots more
so if you want to get more credible than
them uh it's also debunked by the uh
World Health Organization
the
wh wait what you don't trust them why
wouldn't you trust the World Health
Organization what are they oh yeah yeah
not really credible are they so you got
the CDC you don't trust and the World
Health Organization but they're not the
only ones we also have the National
Institute of
Health H who are they do you trust
them I don't now but keep in mind I'm
not saying any of them were
wrong I'm saying that do I believe it's
true because one of these groups said so
nope nope we don't live in a world where
you could believe it just because one of
these groups said it was
true we don't know you know what
tentacles the pharmaceutical companies
have with them we don't know if they're
operating in a fear because they don't
want to be treated as a conspiracy
theorist like RFK Jr Maybe they just
want to collect their royalties collect
their paychecks and not cause any
trouble like everybody else in the world
so I don't really trust that but then
then there's uh all here's the good news
there are also peer-reviewed
studies that debunk him oh few
peer-reviewed
studies how often are a peer-reviewed
study is correct and
reproducible half the time
if it's half the time it's a coin flip
if it's a coin flip why do you need a
study you see where I'm going with that
if it's a 50% chance that the study
doesn't tell you the truth it's a coin
flip and if it's a coin flip and you
don't know which way it
is the study has no
value do you see what's
missing a uh controlled randomized
uh Placebo
study where's that I've been told that
you don't really know what the science
is unless there are randomized
controlled studies does that sound like
a peer-reviewed study I mean it could
also be peer-reviewed but peer-reviewed
is the lowest level of credibility in
science it's literally just a coin
flip and if the question is does
something work or not work hurt you or
not hurt you it's kind of two choices
coin
flip so their best science is a coin
flip now of course real scientists are
going to say that's not true we had lots
of different observational studies who
funded them right who how often do we
have a study and they just looked at the
data wrong or did the stats wrong all
the time I don't trust anything about
peer-reviewed studies but then they say
that there's this one individual who who
was discredited in his 1998 study so
he's a person who came up with this idea
that uh um and then it he was thoroughly
debunked it says Wakefield Andrew
Wakefield lost his medical license due
to ethical violations and falsification
of data his claims have been rejected by
the scientific Community okay that could
be totally true
you know what else could be totally true
that if 100% of everything he said was
true including his
data that big entities would discredit
him until he was um completely
destroyed how do I know that because I
live through the pandemic did we not
watch professional doctors be completely
destroyed because they disagreed with
the mainstream we did and were the
people who were destroyed were they
wrong in everything they said not so
much not so much so there doesn't seem
to be a
correlation when you've got big money
involved you know it'd be different if
it was a different topic but where
you've got the big money in the Pharma
compan is
involved being discredited as an expert
doesn't have any evidentiary
value would you
agree in the old days if you told me
that all the big entities discredited an
individual I would have said oh that's a
discredit
individual but after watching the
pandemic and knowing that you know money
distorts everything I look at it I go
that doesn't actually mean
anything now I'm not I'm not supporting
what he said I'm saying that whoever
debunked him including saying his data
was wrong and all these ethical
violations they allege doesn't really
have credibility in today's world could
be true but how would I know so then I
said to myself all right if there's not
a single source that disagrees with
Kennedy that I that I consider
credible then how do you explain what
seems to be like a huge increase in
autism how many of you think that there
is a big increase in
autism how many of you how many of you
would how many of you you would say well
that's a known you know everybody knows
there's a huge increase in autism how
many would you say that's true so I
asked chat GP and again you have to be
careful because chat gbt might be
hallucinating it's not it's not
reliable but um I'll tell you what he
said and then you can correct me if you
see something wrong so apparently you
don't have to think that the
vaccinations are causing autism you
don't need to think that because you
have so many other
explanations that are better
explanations of why the autism is going
up you want to hear the better
explanations according to chat GP number
one increased awareness and improved
diagnosis oh so it's not that there are
more it's just that the Medicals medical
people are spotting it and labeling it
so it's really just a identification
problem or there's broader diagnostic
criteria oh oh so it's not just that
they're spotting more of them but the
category of what you would call you an
autistic person has been widened so it's
it's a bigger net so really it's just a
data thing they're just picking up more
of them because of the way they're
measuring
it um there changes in health care
practices um and if more people have
access to health care it's more likely
they'll be identified as having any
problem including autism so that's part
of it is just better health care so
we're spotting
it uh increased recognition of autism in
different populations okay so we didn't
recognize it as easily in girls it was
more obvious in boys but now that we
know what to look for and girls we go oh
wow it was probably always there we just
didn't notice it
before um how about genetic
factors well uh Research indicates
according to Chad gupt that genes play a
role uh but do not alone account for the
increase in
cases
so it plays a
role but it doesn't tell the whole story
what's
missing what percentage of the story
does it tell does it tell 80% of the
story or 20% of the story or 1% of the
story if you don't know how much the
genetic part
is you're kind of Flying Blind here
aren't
you I used to believe and by the way
this is still my operating hypothesis
there's some amount of the autis
and specifically
Asbergers uh also I don't know if you
want to count that as just part of the
same story but I think that has to do
with people who have a propensity to
easily finding each other meaning if two
Engineers who aren't quite Aspergers but
they're both you know one toe over the
line if they have a kid the odds of the
kid getting it from both sides are
better and we have a world where you can
find somebody living on the other side
of the the country who's also a computer
programmer like you and you have lots in
common so you get married in the old
days you just married whoever was
nearby so you had much more random
mixing of genes but now the people who
are you know right on the
border of having being on the Spectrum
let's say um are more easily finding
each other and finding things in common
so I don't know how big the genetic
factor is and then they say
environmental factors less well
understood
prenatal exposure to substances could be
just a pollution problem in the
environment and
uh um basically the bottom line from
chat GPT is that we can't even be sure
there's more
autism
because it we're just diagnosing it all
right now I have a um one of my BS
filters is when observation does not
match science
let's say the science is saying there's
no more autism than there ever was does
that match your
observation you live in the world are
you observing that there's more autism
or are you
not I'm observing that there's
more it seems like it comes up all the
time
now especially you know if you're on the
Spectrum I'd say it comes up way more
so to me these science here is not quite
matching so now that you've seen the
whole
thing so the whole story is that they
their entities none of which I consider
credible doesn't mean they're wrong I
just don't accept them on their word are
the ones who say that RFK Jr is wrong
about vaccinations and at least the
autism
part but on top of the autism part he he
has other
claims about chronic illness
now that could be mostly diet the
chronic illness but you certainly have
to look at the vaccines too just to make
sure you've checked everything so I have
no specific information that would
suggest vaccines are dangerous um I'm
just saying that if you look at the
world of how we know
things there are some really big
questions to be answered in the how we
know things about vaccines and whatever
impact they might be having so don't
trust
anything uh according to just the news
the news site just the news um the
Department of Defense is withholding
documents on the question of whether Dei
hiring improves National Security H I
wonder if
Dei improves or decreases National
Security how could we possibly fund the
study to find that out
oh you could just ask me no it's no
good again for anybody who's new when I
criticize Dei as a system it has nothing
to do with any groups genes or
capabilities has nothing to do with
culture it's just a system that on paper
can't possibly be good because it
requires a an artificial shortage of
enough diversity because everybody's
going to look forward to at the same
time if everybody's looking for the same
diversity and there's not enough people
in the pipeline they will not sit with
empty
jobs they will just keep going down the
capability list until they can hit the
diversity Target it guarantees that
you're hiring less qualified people
again not because of their genders or
their genes or their culture it's just a
system problem they're just not enough
of the people you want to hire so you
lower your standards now you might say
to me Scott in the real world nobody's
going to lower their standards to the
point where it would make the country
unsafe to which I say have you ever
lived in the real world no in the real
world it happens every time every time
every time in the real world so
if you haven't lived any minutes in the
real world you think oh the managers
will obviously just try harder until
they can get diversity and the highest
qualifications you could ever get
because why wouldn't they yeah that
works great if you're apple or
Microsoft and you know people are
fighting to work there you can get the
best of everything including diversity
what about the rest of everybody else
what about the government do you think
the government is getting the the the
best of the diverse candidates or do you
think if you were diverse you were part
of the diversity
world and you were qualified for any job
wouldn't you go to Apple why would you
work in the government at all why would
you go for the big money and the cushy
job and the you better respect so the
government in particular should be the
place where there's the most emphasis on
Dei and the fewest number of applicants
who are diverse who would be willing to
work for the government when they could
just go get a you know twice the pay
somewhere
else on paper it should guarantee that
we're less safe
that's the
design if you just look at the design
and you say where is this going to lead
us it's
easy now like I said if it's Apple
computer it might look different because
you know in The Limited pool of diverse
candidates who have the right technical
skills maybe Apple can get most of them
because it's such a cool place to work
so there might be big companies and may
maybe even Mark cubin you know he's a
big on Dei May maybe Mark Cuban because
he's a celebrity and you know he's got
resources Etc maybe he can just try
harder and get a fully diverse Workforce
without giving up a single
thing but not everybody else can do that
and certainly the government can't the
government's going to go for diversity
real fast and they're going to worry
about meritocracy
last that's your
government how's the government doing
well since uh 2021
our border control and our border patrol
agents have apprehended
1,746 known or suspected
terrorists uh at the
border
1,746 known or suspected
terrorists what but here's but here's
the kill
shot the majority of them 1,89 came
across the Canadian
border and they were caught at Point
points of Entry so these are just the
ones who thought it was worth taking a
chance to go across the border at a Port
of Entry when I'm pretty sure that
people can get across the Canadian
border to the United States without a
Port of Entry I mean I don't know the
details but I'm pretty sure there's a
way to do
that so when you say known or suspected
terrorists um I would like to know the
ratio of known to suspected
wouldn't you what exactly makes you a
suspected terrorist my assumption is if
you were a young male who doesn't have a
lot of records and you come from a
country that isn't friendly to the
United States and maybe you're part of a
culture that isn't at least in that part
of the country or that part of the world
does that make you a suspected
terrorists even if you've done nothing
you've done nothing in that domain are
you still suspected terrorists do they
check your social media to see if you've
said suspected terrorist things so the
the first question I'd ask is uh how
many of them are known
terrorists because they're the ones I'm
worried about I'm way less bothered by
suspected um but obviously have to worry
about them
too so we're letting in terrorists by
the gazila
the debt is
unpayable but for
now life goes on today anyway just wait
for your flying baby robots to come
rescue
you now I've had this feeling
today that something big is about to
happen because it's way too quiet you
know even though there's lots of chat
chat chat on politics none of us really
important like I was looking at all the
news stories today and I thought yeah JD
Vance said some things I don't care yeah
somebody brought a camera
to uh
Arlington not to disrespect anybody
literally for the purpose of respecting
them I don't
care uh there's a new democrat who's
going to endorse Trump that I never
heard of I don't care there's a bunch of
staffers for X GOP never trumpers 200 of
them who are now Pro Harris I never
heard of them I don't care right so
there's way too much news that doesn't
even look like
news something's about to
happen California is going to ban voter
idea for local elections well that I
think we knew that was going to happen
um I don't know does anybody else feel
it
because my feeling is that news is
generally fake and when it gets quiet
it's because the people who make fake
news are ready for to land a big one and
they don't want a bunch of competing you
know almost as big stories that are
bubbling at the same time so as soon as
I see the bubble rate go down and stay
there for a day I say oh I got something
coming I don't know that that's you know
that that there's any way to detect it
that way it just feels that way so it's
just a
feeling Scott doesn't do a real job why
would he retire well that's what I'm
saying you're not disagreeing with me
I'm saying that as long as I can do the
job and that I don't mind doing the job
it would seem unethical to stop because
I'm I'm contributing to the system in
some way that feels meaningful to
me tomorrow would be the day to drop it
if there's something big you think it'd
be a Friday thing depends how big it
is so some of you think that uh there's
a rumor that Biden will step
down so that kamla can run as an
incumbent here let me give you the
argument against it you
ready the argument against it is if
kamla had to take over the
Reigns I don't know how she could handle
that transition at the same time is
running for office I think that would
overwhelm her or anybody really so the
only way she could take over the
presidency because there's also the you
know the the turnover of you got to pick
a staff and you know I don't think you
just automatically take your vice
president staff so to me it seems like
they would be putting too much on
her 60 days before the
election I wouldn't be
surprised if Biden steps down if she
wins after the
election because even I would say
there's not like a well let me let me
put the question to you if you know
Biden is toast and let's say
hypothetically KL Harris won in a way
that you thought was legitimate
enough wouldn't you be just as happy if
she took over immediately instead of
waiting till
January I wouldn't have any reason to
make her wait I'd say let's let's just
get in there you might as well just take
over I'd rather have a human in the job
so I think they'd wait till after the
election that's what I think and and if
they were going to do something before
that um I think they would be signaling
it harder so it wasn't a
surprise so I'm going to guess that
Biden stays an office through the
election but if Harris
wins he would reason L soon step down
spend Christmas with his family and just
be out of all the January nonsense and
that would make that would make sense
for an elderly man who's got some issues
that would be the best way to treat him
I think all right that's all I got for
you
today I'm GNA go do some other things go
enjoy your day it's going to be
amazing and uh I'll see you all
later I'm going to say goodbye to
everybody on the rumble Studio I've got
a separate device running the locals
peoples so they're going to stay with me
and I'll see you all tomorrow thanks for
joining bye for now
