hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
one of if not the best moments
of your entire life sure you're thinking
to yourself
well what about the birth of my first
child
well that was cool too i'm not going to
minimize that
but it was no simultaneous sip i think
we can agree
and to enjoy the simultaneous setball
you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker shells
or sign they can't eat your flask a
vessel of any
kind preferably with no hole in it
fill it with your favorite beverage i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopa bean hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's coming up now
go
oh wait there's a problem usually it
makes
everything better well hold on hold on i
get i have to do another sip there's
something that's not working
damn it it doesn't make everything
better
george conway is still a big pimple
on the president's ass
i guess i guess there's some things that
even the simultaneous
sip can't fix
speaking of george conway he's uh he
wrote
a scathing article a scathing article in
the washington post
and if you if you saw the tweets
about the article you would know that if
you're a trump supporter
he just trashed you
he showed you with his
sarcasm that's right the
democrats once by the way once you see
this you can't unsee it
the republicans by and large try to
argue with data and reasons
sometimes their data is incomplete
sometimes the reasons are not perfect
but they're at least
trying to use reasons
and they're trying really hard to use
data
and they're trying to use science it's
just really hard
because the science is changing the data
is always incomplete
and we're not really that good at using
logic if
you talk about the whole world we're not
all good at it
but democrats seem to have completely
abandoned
that fool's errand because trying to be
rational in the irrational world
it doesn't work as well as you would
hope it would
but the democrats have completely
abandoned that model
in favor of replacing it all with
sarcasm
once you see it you cannot see it they
literally use
sarcasm as a substitute for reasons
and you'll see that all the time now
that i mention it
and certainly the whole george conway
article was that included in his article
he continued he's he's trying to dump on
the president for
you know being wrong or being silly or
being crazy and he spreads
the fake news that the president
suggested drinking disinfectant
now if you're going to spread the most
obvious
fake news as if it's true
you don't have any respect for the
people reading your stuff
and i can see why he wouldn't oh i want
to
call out one of president trump's best
persuasion plays and i didn't see it
live but i heard about it
so so give me a fact check on this it is
true
that the president referred to the green
new deal
as a as a child's plan
that happened right so i want to call
out
that that is really really good framing
because first of all you've got greta
who looks who looks
young and looks younger than she is so
she's not quite a child anymore
she's probably pushing 18 not quite 18
but you know she's she's approaching
adulthood
but because she looks young and because
the children are the ones who are
protesting etc
there is very very much a young flavor
to the green new deal
even aoc is young for a politician
so there is in your in your biased
irrational mind it does bias toward
young people
who want to you know get the most active
and fixing
climate change as they see it now what's
good about this is that it's
what i call a high ground maneuver
once you say something is a child's plan
yeah you can kind of walk away you don't
need to get into the details
because once you've so labeled it
it starts looking like it now here's
what a child's plan look like and i'll
tell you from my own
child's plan when i was a kid i was very
angry at my father i don't know how old
i was maybe six
i was angry at my father that he would
not help me build a functional airplane
so that i could fly around my town and i
thought
how hard is it really to build an
airplane
come on it's wood
it's nails we got wood we got nails
plain needs an engine look we got we got
lawn mowers
they've got engines how hard is it to
put an engine
on a little airplane that you build in
the backyard you've got lumber
you know how to measure things you know
what an airplane looks like
come on father build me a functioning
airplane or you're worthless to me
really what kind of a unscientific
father do i have who can't build me a
functioning airplane on a wood
freaking loser
that's a child's plan a child's plan is
build me an airplane out of wood dad
right you recognize that as a child's
plan you don't need to get into the
details
scott scott scott there might be more to
this than you think
i'm not sure your father has all of the
lightweight materials and
tools necessary to build a functioning
airplane
but you don't even need to get into it
it's just a child's plan
likewise the green new deal when you
throw in the
get rid of meat and airplanes and stuff
like that
you don't need to argue that stuff and
i think that it's sort of a waste of
time to engage it like it's serious
simply calling it a child's plan is
really good
because it's not as if we're capable of
hashing out the details
it's not like we're capable of knowing
if those long-range projection models
are accurate and or accurate enough
you know within a range we don't know
what the economic outcome will be
we don't know what new technologies will
come up what changes will
will surprise us
it's just a child's plan it's very good
all right um
one of the things that this whole covert
thing is doing
and i talk about this in the terms of
persuasion
everything that's associated with
everything else
gets smeared by anything that happens to
one of them
so let's say you were a twin and your
twin causes a
horrible murder well even if you had
nothing to do with it
it kind of washes over onto you
shouldn't
but people aren't going to look at you
the same it's just the way our world
works that one
that if there's any relationship with
two things
whatever happens to one just bleeds over
into the other
in our irrational minds and look what's
happening
as we collectively we citizens of earth
try to figure out what is scientific
and what is not scientific in this covet
situation
and the more we wrestle with this and
the more we see science of failing
and failing and failing correcting
failing correcting
now the correcting part is a good part
and of course
as we all are sophisticated to know
science is
mostly about failing but you're failing
forward well that didn't work that
didn't work hey
try this oops it didn't couldn't
reproduce it
try this oh there you go you reproduced
it so you're mostly failing
until you you hit that little nugget of
truth that maybe you can hold on to for
a while
but when you're in it it looks like
mostly failing
right if you get to just check out the
end result it's like hey
good job scientists uh we figured out uh
gravity and what and whatever else
but if you if you're actually in the
process of the science
creating the answers and not knowing the
answers it just looks like science is
completely incompetent
it's not it's not science is every
bit as good as it was last year when you
trusted it more
it's just that you're in the fight and
you get to see all the ugly stuff
because they can't hide it now what's
that do to your thoughts about climate
change well there should be
no effect if we were rational creatures
we would say oh you can't compare these
two things
one is the fog of war it's brand new
it's a novel coronavirus
trying as hard as we can of course we're
wrong more than we're right that's how
science works
until you become more right then you're
wrong
don't know how long that takes we're
gonna have to test a lot of stuff and
make sure
we can reproduce those tests and
everything else
but what about climate change suddenly
suddenly whatever bad feelings you're
going to develop from this
about science and you know you are right
i don't care who you are if you're
watching this it's hard to be
just as confident about scientists
as it was a year ago a year ago i bet
you
felt a little bit better about the
accuracy of science
now you're going to take that to the
climate change discussion
and even if you don't acknowledge that
that
that baggage is coming with you it's
coming with you
it's common with you and it's healthy
because the problem with the climate
argument is that there's a bit of an
over claim about what they can know
about the future
uh certainly about the economics of the
future and how we'll adjust to higher
temperatures etc
i am on in case anybody's new to this
i'm on the team that says
temperatures are almost certainly going
up
and the humans are some part of that
but it doesn't mean it's the end of the
world because we're really good at
adapting
so that's my feeling anyway um
here's uh let me give you a
anecdote from my past that will be
useful in understanding
the present we are obsessed with trying
to figure out which of our leaders are
brilliant
and which of them are idiots right it's
sort of our
our main occupation oh that's swedish
prime minister or whatever they have
king
i don't know what is it what does sweden
have do they have a president
prime minister i have no idea that's
how american i am i'm so american i
don't even know the form of government
of our allies that's that's as american
as you can get
am i proud of it not necessarily all
right here's my story
when uh i was working at crocker bank a
big
bank that was bought by wells fargo
later but in san francisco it was a real
big bank
and my job was to study the performance
of the
individual branch managers on a
variety of measures that senior
management would provide they'd say
you have to cross-sell this much and
bring in these many deposits etc
and then i would i was in charge of
collecting all the data
putting it into some kind of summary
reports doing a little programming
uh to make reports and
to tell management which managers did
better
but apparently i'm the wrong person for
that job
because that's not how it went i went
into the senior vice president
who was sort of the person i mostly
reported to for this information
and i said you know if i'm being honest
you're not really measuring what the
managers
you're not really measuring the skill of
the managers
because if you give them a goal and some
exceed the goal
and some don't meet the goal but the
goal is different for each branch
right so every branch had its own goal
that was customized for their situation
i said if you find out that somebody
exceeded their goal
and somebody did not what have you
actually measured
have you measured the quality of the
the manager i would say no
what you measured is the quality of the
person who set
the goal right because whoever set that
target
what if they were wrong what if it was
unrealistically high
what if it was unrealistically low you
haven't
measured the quality of the management
all you've done
is measured the quality of your
measuring
and you didn't even really do that right
on top of that i said you do realize
that even the data
you know forget about the fact that
measuring against these arbitrary goals
the senior management made forget about
the fact that that's nonsense
even the data is wrong and i said to my
boss
it's my job i guarantee you that the
data that's coming in is not reliable
and i gave reasons you know the state is
not reliable for this reason
i had to use an estimate i had to make
an assumption whatever
and this is when the senior vice
president
looked at me and gave me
one of the biggest red pills i've ever
choked down
are you ready for it you you can live
this experience
vicariously this is one of the biggest
red pills you will ever eat big
corporation
i'm in charge of figuring out which
branches are doing well and which
are not i tell my boss that my own data
is
worthless worthless completely worthless
and worse than worthless probably
harmful
because it's so bad you're going to be
you're going to be
firing people who did a great job i mean
that's as bad as data could be right
and my senior vice president who was one
of these
i honestly think he was one of these
enlightened people he wasn't like a
regular boss
there was something different about this
guy bill riley was his name
i hope he's still alive he was a six
foot
i think he was six foot eight bearded
elf of a guy
and there was just something a little
bit more aware about him
you you could tell it it wasn't just
that he was smart
he was just seeing things a little more
clearly and when i told him that my data
was completely worthless
for the intended task of managing his
managers he looked at me
and he gave me this red pill that i give
to you
i don't care i'm only going to use it
when it agrees with what i was going to
do anyway
how's that taste he wasn't kidding
it's exactly what he did when there was
a manager that he felt for his own
reasons
was not doing the job he checked my
numbers if they coincidentally said that
manager did not meet their numbers
he'd say well okay good hey you didn't
be your numbers you out of here
not because of the numbers because he
was going to fire him anyway
and if he found somebody you thought was
doing a good job but their numbers were
bad he'd look at it and say
damn we better we better adjust your
goals it looks like we messed up
if you think that data
is real you're not
quite out of the children's table data
is
almost always not real i know
i was i was in charge of inventing
unreal data
it was my professional job to make data
that wasn't accurate
and we still used it for decisions so
if you don't understand that that's the
normal way the word
world works that's not the exception
it's not the exception
because when i changed the pacific bell
it was just more of the same
i had similar kinds of jobs so
and of course the dilbert cartoon was
born out of that experience
specifically the experience that the
insanity that i experienced at one
company
wasn't limited to that company the
moment i
changed jobs and i realized uh you know
my first thought was
i'm free i'm free i'm getting away from
that company that makes
irrational decisions finally i'm at i'm
at the phone company now and
now it's all going to be you know good
rational
no nope that's how the dilbert cartoon
was born all right let's talk about some
other things
you all know let's talk about some
doctors
if you are going to invent a fictional
character
who was going to appear at this point in
history
maybe they existed but they're going to
appear on the the scene as a hero
what would be a good fictional name
to give somebody who is going to be
really smart but also really strong
and take the take the whole world on
their shoulders
i might give them the name dr scott
atlas
sounds pretty smart and pretty strong
right i mean the scot part tells you
that's
they're smart the doctor part helps but
it's the scott part that tells you
there's they're smart and then the atlas
part
literally based on a mythological
creature who could hold the
entire earth and heavens on its shoulder
what a great character name for this
simulation oh it turns out that that's
the new white house a
medical advisor on the coronavirus now
my understanding is um
that he's pro going back to school and
a little bit more pro let's open things
up
i don't know too much about him so i'm
going to look into it a little
and get back to you but speaking of
doctors
uh one of your favorite doctors uh
dr tadaros uh and you know of him from
the hydroxychloroquine uh videos
you know that he's uh he's in favor of
at least giving it a chance and
letting people um letting people
prescribe it
and he weighed in recently on this herd
immunity question
which you've been seeing about and the
question is this
for this specific virus do we need to
get the 60 or 70
infections before we have enough herd
immunity
and there are lots of smart people who
are saying it doesn't seem to be the
case
that it's it's not a confirmed thing i
would say
but there's strong indication that some
people have some kind of natural
t-cell immunity that's not the kind of
immunity you pick up on a test
because it's not specific to this virus
and that there may be so many people
that have it that real herd immunity
comes
at lower than 20 percent
if if real heroin immunity comes at
lower than 20 percent of people infected
how would we know that's true what would
that
look like well it would look
a little like sweden because sweden i
think is under 20 percent
infected and they seem to have driven
their
infections down to you know nothing or
nearly nothing
so that would be but that's not a
confirmation right that's just one piece
of data
that is compatible with the hypothesis
right being compatible with the
hypothesis doesn't prove anything that's
why you have the
the high quality studies because these
things can be so
misleading can be confirmation bias can
easily be coincidence
but let's look at some other examples
about the diamond princess cruise ship
you got a bunch of people on the cruise
ship in the worst possible circumstances
so in the end how many of the people on
the cruise ship
got the coronavirus
19 19
now that doesn't mean that they reached
herd immunity it doesn't mean that that
proves that
20 or so is your limit it's just a fact
that is compatible with a hypothesis in
the same way that sweden is
compatible with the hypothesis but not
proving it
how about jails do we know of any jails
in which more than 20 percent of the
prisoners got the coronavirus
i don't know but i don't think so
if that's true that even in jails
20 was sort of the peak
again that wouldn't prove anything it
wouldn't even come close to proving
anything
but it would be compatible with a
hypothesis
and so i ask you this can you give me a
counter factual
can you find a group of people who were
as
let's say in the same place in an
extended period of time
with massive infections i don't know
what kind of group that would be
but they also never exceeded 20
now it would have to be more than a
family you know a family doesn't count
because you can imagine that they
they're so close that
just everybody gets it but um well no
a family would be also the family
wouldn't tell you anything
because every family is going to be a
special case it could be that none of
them had those t
cells because also they never got colds
could be there's something
genetic could be if they're
african-american
four times more likely to have problems
so so you can't look at a family
so give me a group of non-family people
the military the military
somebody says the mumbai slums there are
closer to 50 percent i i have heard that
they're over 20
and then the confounding variable there
is lack of nutrition
in a general low health so it could
be that there are other factors old
folks homes
all right there's a good one are there
any uh senior homes
in which over 20 percent of them got it
can somebody get back to me on that
the uss uh teddy roosevelt
don't know what that is all right um
somebody says the homeless community i
don't know they're outdoors
and they also you know that
the thing about the homeless community
is that they are probably
so exposed to so many things that are
bad for them
that i wonder if the coronavirus even
has a chance
i mean i think if you're a homeless
person and the coronavirus shows up
you're like your body is like
coronavirus eric coronavirus is here
um you're gonna have to get in the back
of the line do you see tuberculosis
yeah get behind that so i'm not sure
that the homeless population
can tell us anything about those of us
who do not have
a a persistently challenged immune
system as they do
now let's get to the question of kids
spreading
here's what i believe if you have a
definite opinion about whether kids
will spread to adults you
are not being rational
you could definitely have a statistical
opinion
as in you know i've looked at it and i
feel like all things considered
it's a good risk well that would be
reasonable
it's reasonable to say i don't know but
it feels like
90 percent sure that would be okay
i'm not sure the data would support a 90
certainty
but you wouldn't be crazy but if you say
kids do not give it to adults you're
not qualified for the rest of the
conversation
because you don't know that you don't
know that
and science doesn't know that right
so there's speculation only so please
remove your certainty about what kids do
or do not do and if you're talking about
this going back to school
question which by the way i'm in favor
of
that we go back to school um
don't tell me that you know that that
won't affect that
that won't take the virus home to
grandma and let me give it to you in
these terms
would you all agree that there are tens
of thousands of children
infected in this country that fact you
can agree on right you can look it up
and would you agree that worldwide
there are hundreds of thousands of
children
that are infected do we agree with that
so far
the hundreds of thousands of children
are affected secondly
do we agree i think we do that the
uh the number of them that are
asymptomatic
and will never have a problem is nearly
all of them
it's not a hundred percent but it's
close
do we agree on that hundreds of
thousands of kids have it
and almost never do they get sick they
do
there are cases where they do but it's
very rare so let's that's the part we
agree on
here's the question how'd they get it
you ready for that how did the kids get
it
did they all get it from adults
don't know do you do you think just just
use your experience
think about the kids you know who have
ever gotten a cold
did the kids get the cold at home
sometimes
sometimes did the cold did the kids get
the cold
from other kids
pretty much every time i mean not every
time but
i don't know if i would even put it more
than 50
but i think you all have the experience
if you've had kids in the house
that if something's going around at
school
not talking about the coronavirus but
other things
that's a little bit more of an incubator
than even at home
but at home you could get stuff too of
course
here's my challenge to you figure out
how
kids got it if kids only get it from
parents but kids can't give it to other
kids
and kids can't give it to adults
i would be very very surprised
wouldn't you do you think that's what it
looks like
do you think that all those kids got it
from adults but weirdly
they can't give it to adults and weirdly
they can't give it to each other
you think no it's
to to me if i had to place a bet on this
i'd say that kids get it from other kids
they're mostly asymptomatic and that the
kids who
probably have it because they're playing
with their friends you know
when they're not in school but they're
not playing with as many of them
and they're more likely to be outdoors i
would think especially since they're
keeping away from
the adults a little bit so if you can
answer me how
the kids get it i might be open to the
argument
that they that they're unlikely to give
it to
parents but to me the most
reasonable expectation is that kids give
it to other kids that's how they
probably half of them got it and that of
course they would give it to adults
of course they would are there any cases
where teachers
have gotten it yes in sweden in sweden
there are new stories of
a bunch of teachers at some place who
got it
but they didn't study it so well
in other words they didn't do contact
tracing so we don't know if one teacher
got it and gave it to the other teachers
or if some student gave it to one
teacher who gave it to the right we
don't know
but the question of whether working
teachers will get coronavirus
and they'll spread it in a school
environment i think is answered
the answer is yes how often
don't know could be not often
all right with all with all of that
said how is it we still don't know if
if herd immunity is a thing and at what
at what level it happens
how is it we still don't know if kids
spread
to adults and if you think you know
you really need to talk yourself out of
that you don't know
it's a little bit of hopeful thinking
that it doesn't happen
i saw i just saw an article that said
there's no evidence
of kids spreading to teachers there's no
evidence of it do you know what there's
also no evidence of
that if we disbanded the military in
this country
that we would be in trouble or or taken
over by another country
it's never happened never happened so
let's get rid of our military because
there's not a single example
of the united states being taken over by
another country
so no military needed i mean
the fact that there's no evidence
of a kid giving it to a teacher you
should
you should discount the value of that
information to zero
because you know what else we don't know
everything
you know what else we don't know about
the coronavirus and how it spreads and
how to treat it
everything everything is up we don't
know if the masks
work or not i mean there's still debate
on that
we don't know if hydroxychloroquine
works we don't know
if herd immunity is coming soon or later
we don't know so as soon as you feel
you're certain about any of this
i think you're on uncertain territory
look at this look at the time it looks
like
i can tell you that there's
there's a new poll out on the question
of teachers unions
comparing what people think of teachers
unions
now compared to how they thought last
year
and this is from rasmussen so rasmussen
asked people their opinions on
um teachers unions
yeah and what do you think how do you
think that came out
and so this is brand new i think it's
breaking is probably getting published
right now as i'm talking 39 percent of
american adults
still think it's a good thing that most
teachers belong to a public
employees union all right so at the
moment
39 percent think it's good that teachers
have
a union that's down from 45
last year so they've gone from 45 to 39
in one year that's kind of a big drop
uh but it is back to levels measured
um several years ago
and 33 now say it's a bad thing that
teachers are unionized so do you know
what i say
to the to the popularity of teachers
unions
from people who are not teachers looking
out from the outside
do you know what i say about the
declining approval of the teachers
unions
here's what i say hold
my beer because i'm going to drive that
i want to swear but i'm not going to
i pulled myself back from the edge
please insert a mental swear word
where it's needed i'm going to leave you
space for it
okay you can put the you could put the
f word in there and you'll you'll feel
the space
all right it's going like this
hold my
okay you filled it in beer
i'm gonna drive that
fill in the blank statistic
into the blank fill in the blank
teens i'm going to blow that number into
the teens
and then we're going to dismantle the
teachers unions
and we're going to give the black
citizens of this country
the first break that they've had in a
long time
which is maybe a chance at a good
education
for you know the majority um
i think we can do this so
watch for that
have i ever mentioned
that i always get my way in the long run
we'll see if that's true uh there's a
video of
l.a county sheriffs pointing their
their weapons at allegedly
three black teens who were allegedly
victims of a
homeless person allegedly attacking them
so there's lots of allegedly's
in this story so the video is of the
police who are clearly aiming their uh
their uh rifles i guess at
somebody who's not in the in the scene
and the thinking is hey hey they're
aiming those rifles at the
three black teens even though they were
the victims
so how do you explain that and all the
the spectators really young no no no
you know they're the victims don't aim
your guns at them
if you think that you learn something
from that story
you are so wrong video lies
a hundred percent of the time video
can't tell the truth
it can't because video can't give you
context
video gives you what it gives you it
leaves out context
so does video lie a hundred percent of
the time it lies it's only a question of
how much is lying
so if you say i saw the video duh it's
true
well you don't know how anything works
that's not how it works
if you saw the video well you should say
yes i saw the video i was misled
that's what you should say yeah i saw
the video so i know what didn't happen
what didn't happen is whatever you
thought you saw
with that video so will it come out
that there was a reason that they had
they had to worry
and a reason that they were pointing
their weapons yes
yes it's going to come out that there
was a reason
that they pointed their weapons now it
may be that they didn't have all the
information
because there's some suggestion that
they didn't know what they were coming
upon
so since it looked dangerous and they
didn't know it was dangerous in what
particular
way they just pointed their guns at
everybody until they could sort it out
now they kept pointing their guns for
what seemed like too long
do you imagine if you'd seen the rest of
the scene whatever was off camera
do you think that the three black yous
were saying oh
okay glad you're here thank you officers
i'm glad you're here uh let let us make
sure that you know you see we don't have
any weapons
it's this homeless guy you know i've got
a little cut here
can you give me some medical do you
think it went like that
do you think as soon as they saw him
that they they immediately broke off
from what the trouble was and said ah
thank god you're here
can you arrest this guy i don't think so
i think that there was something
happening that made that situation a
little ambiguous
and we're going to learn that all right
and by ambiguous i don't mean that the
black views were guilty of anything i
just mean that the situation may have
been
hard to sort out if when you first
showed up that's all i mean
let's see what else we got how about the
so apparently q or q anon
has gone worldwide did you know that
so instead of being a silly american
thing
q has apparently gone worldwide and it's
becoming
i would argue a bit of a religion
now not quite yet but it's moving in
that direction
and you might say to yourself uh i don't
quite understand why that's
spreading isn't that so obviously
not true that it couldn't possibly
spread
i mean how do we not have heard immunity
against cue
you know what i mean there should be
should be enough people in your family
or your social circle to say
um yeah bob i i know you're interested
in this stuff but
i've got to tell you it doesn't look too
credible to me
well let me suggest this for context
let's bring science into it um
does science say that you will be more
addicted to something
if it if it gives you a reward every
single time
or does science say that you will be
more addicted to something
if it pays off sometimes but you can't
tell when
answer you will be more addictive
it more addicted if the payoffs are
unpredictable meaning sometimes you get
to pay off
sometimes you don't and you really can't
tell in advance when that's going to be
that one causes addiction what is q
q is a bunch of predictions often
with enough vagueness that you could fit
them to different situations
but does q get big things wrong
such as i think arresting hillary
clinton
was one of them yes does it matter
that they get things wrong because you
say to yourself
if you see them getting things wrong
doesn't that disprove the whole
we have insider information thing i mean
they'd never be wrong if it was inside
of
information or rarely wrong but that's
not how
the brain works if you're if you bought
into q
and you see them get one thing right and
three things wrong
will you be more attracted to it or less
you want to say less don't you you want
to say well if i got three out of four
things wrong
any reasonable person is going to walk
away
nope nope
opposite if it gets one and a four right
you make people addicted it becomes a
religion
at one in four how often do your
prayers get answered one in four
if you pray for a promotion one and four
times if you wait long enough
you might go on was it the prayer
well that's for you to decide
but what i'm saying is that the the
nature of religion
which gives you unpredictable payoffs
for your praying and your religiosity
and the rest of the time you say well
you know god is not an atm i mean i
don't i don't just like put a prayer in
and take money out
he works in mysterious ways that's part
of the process
if i get if i got one in four prayers
i'm addicted likewise q
if he gets one and four
you're addicted um the other thing that
it has in common with religion
and again i'm not gonna if this sounds
like um
uh mocking religion then you're hearing
it wrong
i'm just telling you that there are
things which bind things to a movement
and they're fairly
common and universal and it works for
religion
it works for q which is which is not to
say that either them are false
it's just the way people think
so the the vagueness of the predictions
is very powerful because when you when
you have vague
predictions um people do the work for
you
and so you let's say you you had four
predictions
one of them is clearly right but could
have been right by coincidence you know
could have been a good guess
and let's say two of them are a little
bit ambiguous
well it's going to look like a belief to
a believer it's going to look like three
and a four were right
because they're going to say this one is
definitely right and these other two
well you know if i didn't have this one
that was right
maybe i wouldn't believe that there
those vague things are true but since i
got one right
i'm going to say these other two were
close enough the way they were worded
allows for me to say that this thing
that happened fits
and now suddenly you're three and a four
three and a four so vagueness
works in favor of belief because it lets
you fill in the blanks
this is by the way a standard hypnosis
trick
i use it all the time i use it when i
create my comic
the reason that dilbert doesn't have a
last name company doesn't have a name
uh dilbert's boss doesn't have a name
not a first name not a last name
it's all intentional because it allows
the reader to read into it
and fill in those uh those open spots
and it makes you more addicted to the
property
here's the here's the other thing that
religion and
q gets right if you spend time
working on something you will be more
addicted to it
it's just natural just the things you
focus on become more important to you
over time
the nature of cue is that they say do
your own research
so you take the q as your starting point
and then you go off and do a bunch of
work
you invest your time once you've
invested your time in something
you're done right you you've married
yourself to the movement
because once you put time into it you
can't explain it to yourself
except that you believe it and that's
part of what you do
so religion like you asks
the people who are believers to do their
own work
you read this bible can be interpreted
many ways
you know go listen to how different
religious people are interpreting
it find your own connections you know
figure it out yourself
and i think there's something nerdily
delicious about
trying to unwind these mysteries be they
religious or be they
cue so i think the the operative things
are that
um you get unpredictable rewards
there's vagueness and uh
that last thing all right so
so there's a reason that q is growing
it's not an excellent
all right um
well let me ask you this remember uh
2016. i think you remember it
and the the take on trump was that he
was a mentally unstable russian agent
who will destroy the economy and lead us
to nuclear war
all right so you remember 2016 those
were the things
uh mentally unstable russian agent
destroyed the economy lead us to nuclear
war oh and racist of course
racist in there so that was 2016.
what is the big problem with trump after
we've observed him for
three and a half years um
here's the big complaint about him
lately
we can't tell if he's joking about mount
rushmore
so since we can't tell if he's joking
about mount rushmore by the way that's
the biggest problem at the moment
we'd better nominate a cadaver to run
against him
that's actually happening i mean joe
biden isn't quite a cadaver but i don't
think i'm getting
too far ahead of myself
isn't that a big change and i asked
myself why aren't they using all the
things they were using before well
the things they were using before in
many cases were debunked
such as the russia occlusion thing but
what about the other stuff
the other stuff seems like they would
just be evergreens right you could
always go with mentally unstable
and you know you could always go with
you know he's a racist and
he lies you know all the basic stuff why
are you seeing as much of that
well let me suggest here's a reason joe
biden's campaign
is making it really difficult to
criticize
trump here's why biden
lies in every ad everyone and it's
usually
like a real blatant obvious lie and
they're the kind of lies that even the
democrat fact checkers would say
okay i grudgingly agree that's a
complete fabrication
so how do you run against the guy who
your biggest complaint is that he's a
liar
when every one of your campaign ads and
a lot of stuff you say in public
are clearly demonstrably obvious obvious
easy to google
lies it kind of takes that away from you
a little bit
because you know you know it would come
right back how about the idea that
president trump is uh
mentally unstable well
if you had any other candidate running
against trump
you'd probably trot that one out and say
look at my completely
reasonable uh you know completely
mentally healthy candidate
compare that to trump look at what he's
saying about mount
rushmore that's crazy right you'd hear
that if you had a candidate
who was demonstrably and you know
inarguably mentally healthy biden's not
he's just not i mean he's mentally
health unhealthy in a
in a old-person way not a
specifically crazy way but it kind of
takes that approach away
so they can't accuse the president of
lying because biden is lying in every ad
it's hard to say the president's crazy
because that just brings up mental
health and you don't want to go there
how about uh the argument that trump
doesn't take his job seriously
like he doesn't care about it he's just
you know golfing
well sure he's still golfing a lot and
he's still a trump but if you're looking
at the other guy who doesn't leave his
basement and he sends his wife out to
talk for him once in a while
does he look like he's taking this job
seriously
no no biden doesn't look like he's
taking it seriously
it looks like he's hiding in his
basement and waiting for whatever it is
to be over
it just feels like he's waiting it out
how about the charge that trump would be
a puppet
for some other power let's say russia
well that's a little difficult because
because biden is literally a puppet for
another power
which is you know whoever's controlling
him on the democrat side
and he's pro-china
so the whole puppet of a foreign power
thing doesn't really work
when the person you're running against
trump is literally a hollow-down puppet
how does that work so that's not a good
attack anymore
used to be and then i'm gonna quote uh
trey gowdy who i don't know if he made
this up but it's just a perfect
term he said that biden keeps committing
uh
we're saying a bunch of quote racially
curious comments racially curious
now isn't that just the dog whistle
what's the difference between you know
it's it's a racist dog whistle
versus racially and curious state
or racially curious statements they kind
of sound the same don't they
so biden by his own inability and
terrible
campaign has removed from the attack
list
lying because he lies acting mentally
unwell because he acts that way not
taking his job seriously he doesn't
leave the basement
much a puppet for other powers
that's he's even running as a puppet i
mean the man is saying i'm not even
going to make it four years barely
you know don't count on me for that
second term
i'd better bring in a whole cabinet to
support me
you know look at my vice president he's
running as a puppet
and then of course he says racially
curious thing which which
partly takes that off the table as well
so
i think the uh the candidate himself is
just
absolutely torpedoing the campaign
and the campaign is torpedoing itself i
guess
here's a question for you um
russia apparently is claiming that it
has the first vaccine
but of course it has not gone through
the the longer more rigorous
trials that you would do if you really
really wanted to be careful
and apparently it's already been given
to putin's you know daughter or
daughters
and uh this is really going to challenge
what it means to be anti-science isn't
it
because this is going to bleed over into
the whole vax or anti-vax
thing now if you think you're hearing my
opinion on vaccinations it's not going
to be here
all right so i'm not going to i don't
want to even hint
my opinion on this topic while i'm
talking about it today someday i might
i'm not sure i have a fully formed
opinion there but
this is not it okay so i'm just going to
talk about the story don't
don't make some assumptions about my
opinion
the the big knock against vaccinations
has been that they're not
fully tested right the
the vaccinations are not tested when
they're put
in combination with other vaccinations
they've been tested individually
but not in combo so that's one of the
big problems
so now russia comes out with this
vaccine
that all the people who are in favor of
vaccines are going to say oh no
you don't want that one because it
hasn't been tested sufficiently
uh and by the way line up for your
vaccinations that haven't been tested
sufficiently
so it's going to cause the pro-science
shall we say you'll argue whether
they're pro-science
the pro-science pro-vaccination crowd
um are gonna have to explain why you
can't have the russian vaccination
because it's just another vaccination
that hasn't been fully tested
that looks good hasn't been fully tested
so um
i don't have an opinion on this i'm just
saying that this completely messes up
the whole
you know what does it mean to be
anti-science because now everybody can
be anti-science
you know you you don't have to be on the
pro science team
because apparently there is none there's
no pro science team
the vaccination question doesn't have a
pro-science team
it only has a well we feel pretty good
about it
cost benefit yeah we're fairly sure
we like the odds but i'm not sure
there's a pro science team anymore
here's a question that uh mike cernovich
first
you know he uh he inspired me to ask
this question by one of his tweets
yesterday
would the protests have started without
all the fake news
if you imagine a world and it's hard
imagine a world where the news was just
accurate and that's it no agenda
no no team just accurate news
would we be having these protests
and the scary answer is no these
protests are 100
created by fake news and what i mean by
that is that
you know the the even the initial george
floyd stuff
the the michael brown stuff it's all
fake news
in the sense that while a tragedy did
happen that part's real
the interpretation of what happened has
all been fake
we know that the in the michael brown
situation which sparked riots in the
creation of
was it the creation of black lives
matter did it happen after that
but now we know that you know two sets
of officials
the state and now the federal looked at
and said um
it looks like a justified shooting the
whole thing was fake news
and then the george floyd thing comes
this guy's you know
full of fentanyl he's going to die no
matter what
i'm not saying the police did the right
thing because it looks to me like the
police have some explaining to do about
you know the way they handle things but
clearly we're not out to murder him
there's nothing that would suggest it
was a racial
component to it and if the news told the
news
accurately as soon as the issue of
systemic racism became a national
a national phrase they should have said
well where do we find it
and how do we dismantle it and that
should have led them straight to
wait for it the teachers unions the
teachers unions i have estimated
are 80 of systemic racism
because if the teachers unions did not
prevent competition
in school competition and free market
work always improves things we've never
seen the opposite you always get a
better product
with free markets but the teachers
unions prevent that
if they didn't we'd have more free
markets we've had better schools
and then while you can't get rid of
racism
if if your black candidate comes in for
a job and you look at the racism
as a good college solid college
performance
and you've you'd like to get some
diversity in your business anyway you'd
say
oh hell yes hell yes look at this
this is a good good educated person
that's what we're asking for so
racism will always exist because our
brains are just wired for
pattern recognition but we're not good
at it so we see patterns that are not
really patterns and then we act on them
so you're always going to have that but
you can make it
a lot less important in other words as i
like to say
michael jordan doesn't worry about
racism
much during his day he might worry about
it for other people's benefit
and i guess he does but i doubt he
thinks about it in his personal
experience
today maybe in his past but not today
and the point is you can't all be
michael jordan
but if you're financially success and
you're successful and you're doing
well racism isn't going to hurt as much
so you could you could take away 80 of
the pain
of system systemic racism by getting rid
of the teachers unions
and i'm going to drive their popularity
into the teens if it's the last thing i
do
so yeah it is literally true in my
opinion
that the fake news is causing all of
these protests
and now the fake news is trying to stop
it because they realize
that that they've created a monster that
will get
trump reelected and it will let's be
honest
the protests will get trump re-elected
if that doesn't happen i'm gonna have
real questions about the accuracy of
those polls
or the accuracy of the vote if it's at
this point
it's kind of a layup for the president
i don't even know if the challenge is
still in it
because the public is really done
the public is done with lawlessness and
there's only one candidate
promising an end to it with a specific
solution
i've got the national guard they're
waiting
now what's the other thing that uh
everybody said about this president a
month ago but they stopped saying
he's a dictator right
would your dictator have already sent
troops into chicago
yeah of course he would would your
dictator have already sent troops into
portland to
calm that situation down yeah
probably on day two it wouldn't be day
55 any dictator would have taken
care of that stuff right away but he's
not
and it's so obvious that he's not
because of this very thing that he just
won't send the troops until they're
requested
i think that argument is gone too so
there's not much left
um all right
so let's see if i covered everything and
well it looks like i did it looks like i
did
enjoy your last months of relevancy
cartoon boy
says this guy in all caps
i hate to block the all caps shouting
trolls
but they will be missed um
yeah i think everybody's saying what i'm
saying now i don't believe there's
anybody who thinks that the looting is
going to do anything except
get trump elected it's pretty
it's pretty direct line at this point
um happy birthday
to uh sue happy birthday
all right that's all i got for now and i
will uh
talk to you later
