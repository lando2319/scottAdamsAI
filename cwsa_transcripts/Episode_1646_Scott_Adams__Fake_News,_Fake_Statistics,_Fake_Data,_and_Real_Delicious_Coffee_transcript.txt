good morning everybody and welcome to
the best darn thing that ever happened
to you
and
i don't know how life could get any
better but it just happened
you happen to be watching
coffee with scott adams
think of all the poor people around the
world
not necessarily monetarily poor
but spiritually and philosophically poor
entertainment deprived
those are the people who are not here
with us today
and if i may say so
and i don't like to speak ill of other
people especially when they're not in
the room
but the people who are not watching this
they're not as smart and not as sexy as
you are
i'm just saying
i don't have science to back that up
but anecdotally
every one of you looks smarter and
better looking
than every other person who isn't
watching and i don't think that's a
coincidence
well we'll talk about statistics and
things that are just as exciting as that
but after a thing called the
simultaneous su a sip
i don't know what that was
and all you need is a copper a mug or
glass a tanker jealous to sign a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and do you know how hard it is to read
your comments at the same time i'm
talking
try it sometime it's not easy
go
ah
yeah
i didn't think it could get more
satisfying but then it did
it did
all right if anybody's new to this
live stream
uh the connect connect the dots that's
happening on my head is just a
dermatology thing
uh i did not get beaten up
i deserve it
i think we could all agree on that
if anybody ever deserves to get beaten
up it's probably me
according to at least a third of my
a third of the people who follow me on
twitter
all right
oh
damn it
technical difficulty of the the worst
possible kind
looks like my notes didn't print out but
i unlike other people have a backup plan
it goes like this
here we go
so uh
let's start with cnn's fake news
how many of you have noticed that i can
do a segment just about every day of the
week
that begins with let me tell you about
the fake news on cnn
and i think most of you would agree that
when i explain why i say it's fake news
it really is
now what are the odds
that you could just do that every day
well
so there's a new video that was released
by
i guess the january 6 committee
and it shows uh
some of the capital rioters as they call
them and cnn
making what they call graphic threats
against former vice president mike pence
and other lawmakers and then they showed
the clip
now keep in mind
this is a compilation
so it shows
rioters plural
making graphic threats
so i'm thinking wow how many of them
were there
this could be pretty bad
and then i did something that not
everybody's going to do
i actually clicked on the video
to see these people saying the terrible
things
there were two of them
[Laughter]
but really one
really just one
and the other person who made a joke
about it
and laughed
so it was more like
it was less like
a compilation of people making graphic
threats than it was about one guy taking
a selfie
and saying some hyperbolic things about
you know what what they would do
with the wrong side
the guy behind him laughs and says yeah
off with her head
clearly joking
now these these people were together
they weren't just like you know
coincidentally in the same place it
looked like they were the part of the
same little group his friend literally
laughed
about yeah off with her heads now let me
ask you this
in a group of people that would say
whatever number you want to put on it
98 percent
just patriots
i'll just pick a number without any
backing but i'm guessing 98 of the
people there were literally just
concerned about the quality of the
election and were patriots were the 98
percent
going to let the 2 percent drag
mike pence into the courtyard and behead
him or hang him or something
like to to imagine that this specific
crowd of people literally the most
patriotic
were gonna hang mike pence who had been
like the loyal number two he just had a
like a technical legal
constitutional disagreement about what
his powers were that 98 of the maga
people were just going to hang him
now
i don't want to minimize the fact that
there were probably bad characters in
the crowd
but aren't there bad characters in every
crowd this size
i mean how can you put this many
americans in any place and not have a
murderer a pedophile
you know some some dirty trickster
an fbi agent
if you took a hundred americans randomly
selected and just put them anywhere to
protest about anything
how many of them would just be so
disreputable
they were only there to loot
or they came there for the violence
it would be every crowd of american
people would have a few
so
uh this is this is the diversity we
celebrate
which i actually do in a weird way i
love the fact that there's every kind of
person
yeah i don't think you'd want it in a
different way
because if you thought about it like
imagine everybody was sort of the same
it would get old fast
i mean
life would be very uninteresting unless
everybody was just all over the place
which is the way it is
unfortunately some of them are doing
illegal things
now here's the weirdest most iron ironic
thing
uh apparently there's some evidence
i don't know how solid this is might be
more anecdotal
that the defund the police
movement is causing higher gun ownership
because people are realizing and also
more vigilantism but higher gun
ownership because people realize they
have to arm themselves
in the most dangerous places
so if you're in the most dangerous place
and you know that the police have been
defunded you're going to go get yourself
a gun
now what's interesting about this is
that
um
defunding the police is sort of a small
government move isn't it
did you ever think about that
that you know not
not if they're going to use the money
for some other stuff then it's the same
size government but if the only thing
they're saying
because mostly they don't have an
alternative right
even the people who say defund are not
saying i know the alternative is more
like let's experiment or there must be
one
but i would say defund the government is
a small government thing
and doing something that actively
encourages
greater firearm ownership of private
citizens
it's kind of republican it's kind of
republican
and i was thinking what could you do if
you were a republican candidate
and you just wanted an interesting
persuasive messaging
right so forget about what's logical or
true what would be just a a good
persuasive messaging thing if you're a
republican
well i tweeted an example
and i think we'll see how that tweet's
doing a little later
and i said a big difference between
democrats and republicans
is that republicans only want you to own
firearms if you choose to do so
whereas democrats are making it a
necessity
republicans don't want that many guns in
the hands of the public
now i'm not lying
republicans actually are the ones who
would want fewer guns at the hands of
the public
in this specific case
because this is a case of basically
people getting illegal firearms
in many cases at least that's what we're
talking about here so in the most
dangerous neighborhoods there's probably
a whole bunch of illegal firearms people
are buying
and for the wrong reasons to go be
vigilantes
so
i don't know i think you could you could
have fun with this if you were
a republican candidate and just act like
uh
you know that you and the democrats are
competing
on guns but the republicans only want
you to have one if if you want it
the democrats are making it a necessity
but let's let's just shorten it to that
that's your whole message i'm a
republican
i'm running for whatever office in some
high crime area i'm a republican
we want people to be able to own a
firearm if they want one
our democrats are making it a necessity
because they want to defund the police
don't make it a necessity
make it an option we live in the land of
freedom i don't want you to be safe
enough
that you don't have to get a gun but if
you want one i'm going to make sure you
have that right
it'd be hard to lose wouldn't it
it'd be pretty hard to lose
it just completely guts the other
argument but you'd have to depend on
this somewhat anecdotal
stuff about people arming themselves and
becoming vigilantes because of defund
the police
here's a interesting story of which the
interesting part
is not the story
so chris wallace famously left fox news
to go to cnn
and he got
reportedly eight to ten million dollars
a year
compensation to do that
but i don't think he's put anything on
the air yet and there are reports or
rumors
that he's not getting you know producer
and they're not giving him support but
at the same time he went over there
because of
jeff zucker
who now is retiring well retiring
he's resigning
because of his uh
his relationship with an employee that
he did not disclose at least allegedly
that's his reason
and
so that's you know the story is more
like a you know shot and freud
sort of a story because people who were
mad at chris wallace they want to be
happy that he left fox because they
don't like him and then he went to
someplace worse so
you know blah blah
we're happy that chris
chris wallace is unhappy i guess for
some people they would feel it now i
never had a uh particular feeling one
way or the other about
chris wallace's politics or his
performance
um
but i i'm reading this story
and you know i'm looking for the hook
you know what's the interesting part
and then there's this throwaway line
that you know wasn't essential to the
story but you know it's good context
that he's 75 years old
what
suddenly this story went from oh mildly
interesting you know somebody changed
jobs and didn't like it maybe
and you know maybe not because we don't
really know what he's thinking but then
like he's 75 years old
are you kidding me
did you have any idea he was 75
i would have guessed 55
i would have guessed
55. and he does not show it man
you know and his father lived forever
too right so it looks like he has good
genes
but you know this was like this slightly
mildly
interesting story that as soon as i hit
that like what the hell
is happening to the world and here's the
thing
at 75
he went and got a better job
because the money still mattered he
figures he'll probably be around for
another you know 30 years
maybe
so
what does that say about either a good
lifestyle i don't know if that's just
good genes but i imagine it's good
lifestyle right
because you look at him and his weight
he looks like he exercises doesn't he he
looks like he exercises an easter egg
i don't know if that's true
i mean you know if we find out he's a
chain smoker and
whatever i'd be surprised
but
isn't that impressive
damn you know i say the same thing about
joe biden
but joe biden's only a few years older
than chris wallace
and chris wallace looks like he could be
joe biden's son
it's i i don't know i was just blown
away by
what people can do if they're really
trying health wise
all right
one of one of the most interesting
things in the world and in the news to
me anyway is when
statistics and common sense don't match
so the reason that people
use statistics
is because if you could just look at
stuff
and say
well based on
looking at this thing i'll determine
this but it doesn't work and we we know
that for a million reasons so you need
this whole discipline called
statistics
and then there are all these blind spots
that people who do not study statistics
would not even know is a blind spot and
i would argue it's one of the biggest
problems in the world
because you don't have to be an expert
in statistics to learn what kinds of
situations you shouldn't trust
and when statistics is you know
a good thing to use and when it's not
and i would think that the best class
that you could have
for a let's say life strategies degree
would not be necessarily a class to
learn how to do statistics although that
would be great for many people
but for the mass of people who don't
need to be a statistician
wouldn't you like to see a class that is
just about
the blind spots
you know just like if you run into this
situation i'll just give you an example
if somebody's doing a meta-analysis
i'm not going to teach you how to do a
meta-analysis
i'll just explain what it is
and they'll say this is why you can't
trust it
you know this reason because
it's susceptible to what you decide is
in the meta-analysis and what isn't
right that ends up being what determines
it
so
how interesting would it be to be a
class that was no more let's say no more
complex than what i just told you
that oh meta-analysis you can't trust it
because
people will be selecting things and then
secondarily there might be one study
that's the wrongest study but also the
biggest
and if it gets put in the average it's
going to make everything wrong
right so i didn't i didn't use any
complexity whatsoever
but i taught you how to recognize a
blind spot
that if somebody said here's this
analysis and you should trust it because
it's a meta-analysis
you should at least be able to say well
maybe i mean it doesn't mean it's wrong
because it's a meta-analysis
but i would ask these two questions
now
beyond that i'm wondering if there's an
even deeper meaning
when our common sense doesn't match
statistics
and just makes me wonder if that's
another clue that we're part of a
simulation
i'll just put it out there this would be
one of my weaker
you know pieces of evidence
but if you were building a world with
software
i could imagine there would be
situations where you didn't want to have
to explain everything
and you just wanted to put it in the
code all right if this happens then this
will always happen
why
what is the rule of physics that
requires it
i don't have time to write one so i'm
not going to make it a rule it's just it
just happens
so in theory
one would imagine that a symbol a sign
of being in the uh
a simulation
is that there should be some things that
your common sense says
that should not work statistically
but then when you do the math it does
so i mean this is my weakest evidence
for the simulation but i'll throw it in
there
let me give you some examples how many
of you have heard of
the
monty hall problem in statistics in the
comments
i'm just wondering
because my audience is unusually well
informed so just look at the answers
yourself to see where you stand
wow
on locals it's almost all yeses
and how about over here oh
this is quite impressive
now i told you you were smarter and
better looking than all the people who
are not on this live stream right now
and you just proved it
i don't know what percentage of the
general public would know what the monty
hall problem is
but i'm guessing
20 percent
i'll bet no more than 20 percent of the
general public has ever heard of it and
for those of you who haven't heard of it
i'll tell you what it is in a moment
but wow this is this is a really
interesting indicator of the kind of
people watching this live stream
if you know what the monty hall problem
is the odds of you being a rational
person
and really having that preference to be
statistically and scientifically sound
that's a probably a pretty good
indicator
all right here's what the modern health
problem is and i'm not going to do the
boring long explanation i'll just tell
you to google it
if this interests you this is one of
those cases where your common sense
doesn't match
what the math and the statistics will
tell you
and by the way this is something of
which even the highest level thinkers
had long disagreed on
because even the smartest people in math
and statistics
completely disagreed
until simulations were run and the
simulation always came out the same way
so
there's that
all right this is what it is monty hall
problem
um this is just from wikipedia suppose
you're on a game show and you're given
the choice of three doors behind one
door is a car
behind the others goats so you got two
goats and one car and all the doors are
closed you don't know what what is what
you pick a door say number one
and the host who knows what's behind the
doors
opens another door say door number three
now you still haven't seen your door yet
right you've picked a door but it hasn't
opened so that now the host is going to
play with your mind it says opens up one
of the doors you didn't pick
and it shows that there's a goat behind
it
and he then says all right now do you
want to pick door number two which is
the only one
that's not picked and not already opened
do you switch
what do you do now keep in mind the the
smartest people in the world
on this kind of stuff
disagreed
anyway
i'm not even going to tell you what the
answer is that's what makes it fun so go
go look look it up if you want to but
here's i think the bottom line
i think the way to explain this is it
depends what you assume
and
that's that's the blind spot for a lot
of statistics
that it's not really this is the
statistics
that are fooling you
you're making different assumptions but
you didn't realize it
and so the different assumption would be
about
for example
was the host always going to open
another door
and was it always going to be door
number three
right
so if you knew that the host was always
going to do something would your
assumption be different than if you
thought that is spontaneously thought
that based on what you chose
so all of these have a different set of
information
that's being revealed and that's what
makes it interesting now my point is not
what's true and what's not about this my
point is that there's really a big
difference between what you think looks
logical
and what is not now here's what i'm
going to ask you because i'm not great
at statistics but i think this is true
let's say if you have something that's a
one in a hundred odds
what are the odds that happens one in a
hundred
let's say the odds are
200 to two
what are the odds
well the same as a hundred to one right
two hundred to two is same as a hundred
one just math
um but what about this
if i told you that you had one shot
to win something that's a hundred to one
and you you just take you one shot
or
i tell you you can take a hundred to one
shot over and over and over again
which one has a better chance of you
winning
the one where you do it once it's a
hundred to one
or you can do it a number of times but
it's always a hundred to one
the people who study statistics would
say it's the same
right
yeah the the the people who are the
smartest about statistics would say
that's that's a pretty basic one it's
the same
but here's where the common sense fails
if i only get one shot
i'm there and done
but if i can do it infinite times
there's a hundred percent chance i'm
gonna get that
am i wrong if i can do it infinitely no
matter i just do the hundred to one
forever
until it hits
so how could the odds be the same
if one of them is a hundred percent
chance of winning and one of them is a
hundred to one
but they are
[Laughter]
right
now i of course it depends on
right now i think it depends a little
bit
on whether you can do something infinite
times
if you're going to do something just
twice
is there a big difference
let's say you're limited to twice it's
either once 100 to 1
or you can do it twice
in that case
i'm pretty sure the odds are so close to
identical that they're basically
identical
am i right
but it's the infinity that that makes it
a completely opposite so
now um if there's anybody here who knows
a lot more about statistics than i do
and i imagine that's quite a few of you
actually
some of you are probably thinking
scott you have this all wrong you've
described it wrong you got the monty
hall right thing wrong and that's my
point
that's my point
my point is that
you can be reasonably smart and
statistics are still sort of a weird
blind spot
and that even people who understand them
can disagree
so this hundred to one thing is the one
that's been
uh that's been puzzling me forever
and when i see something that can cannot
be false and cannot be true at the same
time
i tell me i tell myself that can only be
because of the simulation
but of course that's not true
it could be just something else i don't
know
all right
now
i might make that meaningful in a moment
so here's something you need to
understand and i think we all understand
this in 2022 in a way we never
understood it say five years ago
that a lot of the news that is true news
meaning it actually happened
is also fake news
because
somebody gets to decide what context you
see it in
and whether or not you see something
that would change your mind if you saw
something else so we've we've sort of
left a realm where the news is either
true or false and that's what matters
because a lot of the news that i call
fake news on cnn
is completely true news
that they've presented in a way that's
clearly meant to mislead
so if it's technically true but
presented in a way to mislead obviously
i'd call that fake news as well
but here's a real question
how much of what you see that's maybe
technically true and sometimes not even
lots of times not even
how much of that is organic
meaning that there was just
you know the business model of the
the news entity just said oh we'll get
more clicks if we do this so that's sort
of organic
and how much of it is because outside
forces have caused it to happen
now if you have a degree in economics i
always say that knowing that economics
gives you like another field of vision
you can just see things more clearly if
you understand the world of money
and you know the short version of that
is follow the money but if you know
economics you can follow it a little
more easily
and economics suggests that given um
a baseline beginning of the media
companies
that over time they would all be
captured
by people with money
let me say that again
any understanding of economics and
if there are people who have economics
backgrounds
can you back me on this or even deny it
so look at the comments
to if you're if you're not
versed in economics
economics would guarantee
just guarantee
that over time
all the news would be owned by
people with money who are not
technically part of the news
right
now the only question is how long it
takes
and whether it's happened to every new
entity i'm going to name a name but i'm
not going to make an accusation about
them okay
this is just an example
so axios is a relatively new entity
could it be that some newer entities
don't have money influence when they
start
but that over time economics would
guarantee that they did
now it also
economics also largely guarantees that
it has it when it starts
but it doesn't totally guarantee it
right so you know i'm not making any
accusation about axios they have a good
reputation as a matter of fact
um and i recommend it i would go further
i would say uh i've added axios to my
sort of daily
daily scan
it's worth doing
but anyway um
and this is very relevant as we're
watching the joe rogan situation
in case you didn't think i was going to
make this relevant
because have you noticed as i say
the continuing roganization of america
which means that all stories must be
told through the filter of what did joe
rogan think about it
or say about it
or one of his guests
and
it's becoming a little bit more obvious
thanks to observers such as glenn
greenwald
and i'm going to tell you what he has to
say about it now remember economics
suggests
that all news will become fake over time
if only in the way the context is
presented not necessarily the detail of
the news
so glenn greenwald tweets this
it was only a question of time
it was only a question of time before
the all-out war on rogan began
he's way too big and off-key to permit
him to keep going
the concept of free speech in the us is
a mirage
you have it right up to the point where
it matters or can threaten power centers
then you don't
it was only a matter of time
in other words the economics
of joe rogan
his success
made him big enough that he was sucking
power away from the existing power
centers
so what economics suggests
is that the existing power centers would
attack
now that's not proof that they did
right
we're just in a situation that says wait
a minute whenever you have this
situation
you can reasonably predict
if it hasn't happened yet
it's going to happen
how many who have a degree or background
in economics will back beyond that
that that once he became a threat to
eyeballs and and credibility and he
became big enough
they had to attack him
for pure economic incentive
you couldn't not do it really
so sure enough you see all the other big
media centers start to attack him
but then the question is
is that truly organic
because it would be organic in terms of
economics is
organic
if they just said hey here's my
competition now so just like cnn and fox
news go after each other each night
you would expect them to turn on rogan
and likewise you would expect rogan to
turn on at least cnn which he did
so all of the part which is just
you know media entities insulting each
other
that's organic
but is there a level beyond that
where somebody's putting extra money and
you don't know about
because
did you notice
the interesting timing
that the very moment that joe rogan
seemed to have weathered the storm about
ivor mechton and dr malone and dr
mcauliffe
that the moment it looked like he could
weather that
well look suddenly there's a compilation
video
of him using the n-word now of course he
only used it in the context of talking
about it
but you know that would be left out of
the video
um
so then he had to apologize about that
which is a whole sub-story
but
here's a
here's a hypothesis this comes from
twitter user local distance
w-o-k-a-l
distance so just search for him and
him or her i don't know on twitter
but i'm going to read you uh that thread
because
and i'm not going to endorse the thread
so there's a conclusion reached in this
thread that i do not personally reach
but
whether or not the conclusion is right
follow the logic
because it suggests that if it hasn't
happened it will
right
so local distance has this thread
and he's responding to somebody that
goes bubba
since you asked i love your work as he's
talking to somebody else he says i'll
tell you
this is a professional political attack
so that's his hypothesis about the joe
rogan stuff
three waves one right after the other is
not a coincidence
good spacing good timing so it's
absolutely professional
so in other words somebody who
understands this world
is saying if you see somebody murdered
and it's you know two in the chest one
in the head
probably not a coincidence it looks like
professional work
but who is it you ask
that takes some digging but
and then he does some digging
he goes uh the video compilation of
rogan saying the n-word was dropped by
uh at patriot takes an organization i
guess
six days ago
you see the video in the tweet in
picture one so he shows a picture and
patriot takes takes credit for
republishing
republishing the information
uh
that they take credit is important and
you'll see why all right so there's an
organization that
republished it but also takes credit for
it interesting that they republished it
instead of published it
but then they took credit for it
interesting
and then local distance goes on as you
can see in their bio patriot takes is
partnered with uh at midas touch another
organization
and this is where it gets interesting
who is midas touch
well
they are a professional uh political
organization in fact they are a democrat
super pac
more on that in a moment
run by three brothers
all right this is all local distances
thread
the three brothers ben brett and jordan
maisalis i guess all of them have worked
in media and have expertise in
understanding and manipulating media
the most important thing for us is that
brett was a social media manager for
ellen degeneres and is an expert editor
which matters because
patriot takes works with midas touch
and i'd say it's safe bad now this is
local distance talking in this threat
i'd say it's a safe bet that given their
expertise in social media management
that the n-word video was created by
midas touch now i'm not saying this
this is an allegation
in this thread
but we are not done
midas touch is a super pac
well what's a super pac you ask well
a super pac is a political
advocacy group with a special twist
super pacs may raise unlimited sums of
money from corporations unions
associations and individuals
then spend unlimited sums to overtly
advocate for or against political
candidates
so in other words they can gather tons
of money and use it to influence
elections
this means that a super pac can take in
unlimited amounts of money and then
spend however they want politically
might as touch is a super pac they can
take in as much cash as they want
4.7 million for the 2020 cycle and 1.5
million for the 2022 cycle to be exact
and he shows his sources to recap midas
touch a super pac which can collect as
much cash as it wants from pretty well
anywhere and is a professional strategy
and media firm
run by people with deep ties and
entertainment
likely had a hand in the n-word video
now we don't have proof and there's no
allegation of proof just
likely associations and a hypothesis
um and that that they work together blah
blah so the question is why why are they
doing this and what do they have to gain
i think a clue can be found in the
letter at that patriot takes wrote about
all of this
look at the highlighted part now he
highlights the part of their letter it's
an official statement in response to the
broken apology
says that uh this is what patriot takes
said the past week patriot tanks
republished and brought to the attempt
to the national spotlight dozens of
recorded instances where joe rogan used
the n word blah blah blah
but of course
the context was
talking about the use of it
he didn't use it in its native form he
was talking about it right and the
videos have now received millions of
views
so local distance says patriot takes is
bragging about their millions of views
and how they made the video the center
of the national conversation
they're bragging about their clout
rogan is the one guy the leftist can't
cancel if a group could cancel rogan it
would be a massive show of power
woke people in legacy media groups have
been trying to cancel rogan for ages
because he steals their audiences and
doesn't play by the rules rogan also
rogan also offers his enormous platform
to people like jordan peterson that woke
progressives and media circles really
don't like
the group that takes out rogan
would gain a lot of clout and a lot of
power
the group that can say we cancelled
rogan if we can get him we can get you
too
would be able to swing a very large
stick
and that's what this is ultimately about
it's a play for power says
local distance in this thread
in short
goes on white vocal distance
medius medius touch is a political super
pac that is very likely behind the
patriot takes account they're attempting
a viral hit on joe rogan so they can
take him out both because they don't
like him and because they want
monetizable clout for having done so
blah blah goes on some more now
let me be very clear
i am not endorsing or backing the
hypothesis in this threat
but what i am endorsing is the
understanding of how things work
it's a very good description
of how things work
now it gets more interesting
how many other people need to get taken
out either because of somebody's
business model just competition
or for political clout
how much of the joe rogan situation do
you think might be
somebody just proving they can do it
could be that
how much of it is uh democrats don't
want him to have a voice
could be that especially as the next
election comes up
and how much of it is organic and how
much of it is
you know business models
i don't know
but
whenever you see something like this
and i i know you want me to talk about
the fact that joe rogan
uh did another video um i guess you
could call it an apology
in which he described the context and he
was horrified seeing the video himself
i don't have much to say about it you
know some people said it was too far i
get that point
some people said never apologize i get
that point
but
i'll say it again
be very careful
when you second-guess people who are far
more successful than you are
at this stuff
right
take a little bit of humility
when you're looking at somebody who
built
a media empire
with nothing but his own good judgment
am i right i mean talent judgment etc so
if you're if you're saying i would have
handled that differently if i were in
his shoes
you know what else you would you would
have handled differently
everything
that that's why he's that's why he got
100 million dollars and you didn't
because he doesn't do it the way you do
it
be careful
when you criticize somebody in their own
domain remember
this is his domain it's not yours
his domain is the
public
you know how to read the room
he's literally a you know a stand-up
superhero in in today's world
he stands in front of audiences and he
feels them
like in real time
he just feels them he's about as
connected
he's about as connected to his base
as anybody but maybe trump was i hate to
use him in the same sentence because
then it gets political
but oh my god could it be anybody who
had more experience
and is more directly connected like in a
visceral way
standing in front of huge crowds saying
a lot of the stuff that he probably says
on the show
and then he does the show and he has
lots of feedback so
i'll tell you my own
interpretation was if if it were me
it would have been a lot shorter
but i give that advice for everybody for
everything
right
it i i think the his instinct to say
something about it
felt right
the general message he said about it
felt right
but it went it went way too long
he could have hit the high points with
exactly the same point
and i just think it would have been
punchier and better but that that's just
a general statement i make about
everybody's communication even my own
you know if i reread my own tweets i
always think well i could have i could
have left out a word there so it's not
much of a it's sort of like saying
somebody should have done something
sooner
right it's the most generic attack you
could make you should have done it
sooner
true of everything that's good
all right so that's all i mean i'm just
not too interested in the apology part
because i'm not gonna i'm just not gonna
double
i just can't get to the point where i
can
check his work if i can't do his work
am i right
don't check his work if he can't do his
work and i can't do it i don't have
11 million
followers
so
um
but
because everything in the world is
really about me
this brings me to me
and
here's some information you might not
have known
my audience is down about
um
25
maybe 30 i don't know
uh you can you can follow it on the
graph and it just went boom
and and it happened kind of quickly
now there are two reasons for this i
imagine
number one is talking too much about the
pandemic
and a whole lot of the world has moved
on
so i i think i had far too much of a
california perspective
because i was you know i was still in
the prison camp and still am
you know so the people who are out of
the prison
are not going to be so interested every
day hearing prison stories
i get it
i get it
but i tried and failed
and let me say this about myself
i tried
failed to make it more about how we
think about things
but i guess you know
it's just too hard to
you can't thread that needle
you know it doesn't work for everybody
it worked for some of you and i think
for the people on locals it worked
better but
it's a hard general message to do
so my audience is down 25 or 30 percent
and here's one of the things i ask
is that organic
now if i had to bet on it i'd say yes
yeah my bet would be yes
but in the context of seeing what's
happening to joe rogan
and then if you rewind the tape back to
2016
there was something that trump required
in order for him to win that first
election
that i provided
and nobody else did
there was a key to his victory and i'm i
don't think history will ever record
this but it's easy to check i mean you
can go back and check it yourself it's
very easy to check
that until somebody uh reframed him
as a persuader
he was just a liar
am i right he was just a liar in a con
man but until somebody could explain
everything that you saw in a different
frame which was oh this is you know 3d
chess
and then that phrase oh it's 4d chess oh
he's not playing 27d chess and then
everybody started talking about
was he or was he not doing it
intentionally
now that started with a blog post called
clown genius and i redefined him from a
clown
to yes he's a clown but he's a clown
genius he's doing the clowning for
effect and it's working and it will work
i think that without that reframe
and if anybody says that didn't come
from me
just google it yourself you can find out
i don't think he would have won
and i think that there might be you know
half a dozen voices who could say
something similar
that they added something to the process
that was somewhat necessary
you know there were a lot of big
accounts you know the mike cernovich big
account made a difference you know you
could list
a dozen other people who just had big
accounts and made a difference
somebody says narcissist
jessica
jessica you don't want the shelley
treatment do you
there's somebody who wants to get
shelled
you probably knew
you're either new or you're such a good
troll that you know what to say to to
try to get me to
to divert to you
all right
so the point is if you were trying to
lay down suppressive fire
to keep trump from running for office
and winning
would you start now to try to
delegitimize and de-platform
anybody whose voice
would be you know part of that tapestry
yes
now if the whole thing that i read from
vocals
thread if that way of working is a
common way that things happen and i
think that it is
it rings true to me you know i've seen
enough
i've seen enough things you know
personally and in the news that says
yeah that's that looks like a thing
am i already being attacked
and if and if this drop isn't organic
is there an attack to come
because i would expect that anybody in
the top i don't know
20 or so influential voices and
influential would be anything from a big
platform
like a like tucker carlson
look how much tucker carlson gets
attacked right how much of that is just
softening up
the uh the room for the elections
probably a lot
probably locked
um so i i told you that i was expecting
that i would get one of these
like the the lower class version of the
joe rogan treatment
and i'm wondering if it's already
happened
let me ask you this
most of my audience dropped off if i if
i base it on the
feedback
there was there were a number of people
just dropped off because it was too much
vaccine talk and that was organic
but there were a number of people who
were convinced
that i was one of the primary pushers of
vaccinations
where did that come from
and it came from one tweet
which was widely misinterpreted
but totally my own fault
um i'll give it to you graphically
here's the mistake i made now let me
give you some context
if somebody says something and 99 people
understand it and one does not
understand it
it's fair to assume that the problem is
with one person
and that if 99 people understood it then
the person who said it did a good job
but if something like 80 of the people
who see it don't understand it or don't
understand the way you meant it
then clearly
by definition
that's the problem of the speaker right
so
given the number of people who
misinterpreted a tweet i did in 2021
clearly my fault
but
was that mistake
big enough
to cause the reaction that it got
because it was a tiny mistake
but the reaction was really big
so i'll show you the mistake and i'm not
softening it
clear mistake all right
so nothing i'll say next
is a hedge toward the fact that oh this
was just a mistake
but it was a small one
and i wonder if there was anything
behind the fact that it turned into a
big impact here was a mistake i said
that once i got vaccinated personally
in 2021 that from my personal uh
perspective
as a person who is pro-vax only for
myself
i never told anybody else to get vaxxed
and you can fact check that
never nev because i'm not a doctor and
you all have different risk stuff right
so i never said anything about you
i just said that my specific case
all things included i took a guess and
it was a guess
that was my guess
so the moment i got it i had this weird
psychological effect
which is that and here's the part that i
got wrong here was my mistake
i didn't say from my perspective
i i implied it but not well enough
from my perspective the moment i got my
second shot
i never again thought about the risk to
myself
that was just my personal perspective
from that moment on i worried about the
mandates
only i worried about the mandates
and the you know the economy and stuff
so from from this moment i was done but
here's the thing that people jumped on
they said what about us what about us
for us it was always done
scott
scott
it's always been done for us in fact we
don't even think it ever started
in some cases
so i'm not uh nothing i said should
discount this point of view
again that was my mistake not your
mistake
so i should have maybe you know um
just acknowledged there was another
point of view and then it would have
been a little bit more clear that it was
just a perspective
so i'm not saying any of this is true
i'm saying that from a mental
perspective the moment i got the second
vaccination i never again thought i was
in a pandemic
i thought i was in a oppressive
environment
and then people said to me oh you've
changed them anyway
so
i have no direct evidence that
i was the subject of any kind of
organized attack
however
i do expect one
if that wasn't it i would expect one
here's another weird statistical thing
and i'm not sure what to think about it
but there was another this other study
or a latest study at the bar elan
university in israel
it shows that vitamin d
might be perfectly able to predict your
outcomes
along with age
so
this article about this new study
suggests
that the
your odds of having a bad outcome are 14
times higher
if you
have low vitamin d 14 times
and then you
add on age as a predictor and you'd have
two good predictors
now
andre's back house has uh poured some
water on this
and so i always take him seriously
and he pointed out that the the 14 times
more likely actually had a range from
you know four to fifty or something so
it was like gigantic range
but in all cases it was
a serious multiple
right even at the lowest it was four
times bigger risk
that seems that seems big enough to be
meaningful right if it was 50 times more
i doubt it but you know somewhere in the
middle but it doesn't matter where it is
in that range
it would still be the same conclusion
that it would help you predict
and given that they've done
retrospective studies and it did predict
it's
probably
you know it's it's short of being proven
and and let me clarify i'm not saying
that adding vitamin d would help anybody
let me say this clearly we're only
talking about its ability to predict if
you're somebody who's going to get in
trouble
a separate question which is definitely
not proven
as far as i know i don't think it's
proven
i i don't think i've seen proof that
immediately adding vitamin d once you
get in the hospital is necessarily going
to cure you
like that that's a different subject but
the question is does it predict
that you're overweight and it does
because people are overweight have lower
vitamin d on average so does it predict
that you have i don't know cancer
or something i think it predicts a whole
bunch of
general low health things
so as a proxy to determine whether you
should hide
until the virus is over or you should
just live your life it would be a pretty
good
risk management
factor
so andres has some questions about the
the value of it and you should take him
seriously
but i think that
there's no question that people with
high vitamin d
have better immune systems right
[Laughter]
am i wrong about that
that it
if your immune system has good vitamin d
you're almost always going to have a
better outcome of against just about
everything
i don't know
so so to me i don't know why this is
controversial
and as some of you have been nice enough
to
point out
i probably was one of the earliest
people to say at the very beginning of
the pandemic hey there seems to be some
weird correlation here that's vitamin d
related
and
so far
looks like there might be not causation
not causation that has not been
demonstrated
all right so
uh
in theory
and i don't this is not confirmed but i
i did see a report that california even
is going to drop coronavirus
restrictions on february 15th
meaning that the
temporary rules are going to time out
can i get a
confirmation on that
that even in california unless they
renew it which could happen
that it times out on february 15th
i don't see any way that the governor
could politically extend it i think the
fact that we
we caught him without his mask
at least the masks are gonna have to go
away in nine days
but
um yesterday i went to safeway without
my mask i was the only person not
wearing a mask and safeway big grocery
store
locally
and
nobody asked me to put on my mask
now
have things changed
or is it something about me
and i guess i would ask this question of
you
because you know how you can't really
see yourself the way anybody sees you
i've been told
that i look dangerous
not dangerous in the i will kill you
kind of dangerous
but dangerous in the kind in the way
that i could make trouble for you
like i can make your day unpleasant
is that true
does anybody get that vibe from me
somebody says you scared the hell out of
me so i'm getting mixed mixed messages
mostly no
some some are saying definitely yes
you look too short to be dangerous
but remember in this context i don't
mean dangerous physically
interesting
well
because i would have said no like my my
self-image is that i don't i don't seem
dangerous in any sense
but uh other people have said that
yeah interesting
all right um
but here is my uh funny observation
about safeway in my state in california
you've seen all these videos of people
shoplifting with impunity
you'll see a video of somebody filling
up a big bag and then just walking out
because
there's no penalty for shoplifting
so the store isn't going to chase you
because they don't want to get hurt
and you know it's not going to work
anyway
and they can't call the cops because the
cops don't care
so the same store that you're wondering
if they're going to make you wear a mask
if you're an adult by the way i think
kids might get asked to put on a mask i
don't know
uh but
here's what i i was going to say if
somebody asked me to put on a mask if it
was a manager not if it was an employee
or not if it was a
another customer but if somebody who
worked for the store asked me to put on
my mask
i was going to say you do understand
that
even shoplifting
is not
you don't even enforce shoplifting
and the employee would have to stand
there and say well
okay that's true
so i would say let me get this straight
i could fill a pillowcase with goods and
walk out of the store and you wouldn't
say a peep am i right
well that's true
but you do need me to put a mask on nine
days before that's going to be dropped
for obvious reasons
i mean who wants to have that
conversation with me
who wants to who wants to waste their
time
having that conversation with me when
nothing can be gained by it
so i think we've just reached the point
where people
maybe think about asking me
but they know it's not going to go well
don't you think it's not so much that
they're afraid of me in any real sense i
don't think
but i think they just know the
conversation won't go the way they hope
it will go
that they look at me and they say that's
not somebody who's going to put his mask
on just because i asked him to
so it might be that
i think it's the look on my face
that i'm not going to put it on
just because you asked me to
that might not be the only reason
on twitter i tweeted this
and
somebody
chimed into the comments
and said
um i you know you're bluffing
you wouldn't actually shoplift
right in front of the employee just
because they made you wear a mask and i
thought to myself
oh you don't know me at all
if you don't think i would literally
shoplift
just to make a point
you don't know me at all
we have never met
i would totally shop left
just to make a point
especially if it was on video
if you could videotape me breaking the
law
just to make a point
even better
let's let that thing go
let it go viral
anybody who thinks i don't like
attention enough to break a ridiculous
law
just to make a point
you really don't know me at all
yeah i would probably stream it
anyway i thought it was funny that
somebody could
misinterpret my
basic character that
that grossly
all right there we have it
so the question is
can we learn to identify
when professionals are taking somebody
down
and do we see it in the joe rogan
situation
i can only tell you that the people who
are good at seeing it
think they see it
which is different from meaning it's
true
and in my case you know i just use my
case as an example i would say i don't
see it
would you agree
i was saying the joe rogan situation it
does look like that's there's something
fishy going on but in my case i would
say there's no signal for that it's just
something i'm alerted to in case there
ever is a signal would you all agree
that in my case there's no
i wouldn't say there's any direct
evidence of that
yeah
so don't take any speculation beyond
speculation there's no direct evidence
of that
all right this
disagree
um
i mean i can easily be next
but that might also me be thinking too
much myself
um which is
it's adenoidal and weak i don't know
what that means
all right i need to go and uh i will
talk to you
oh my god i just saw a question here
on locals the question was should joe
rogan
interview trump
if
trump decides to run
yes
[Laughter]
yes
it will probably ruin ruin his business
so maybe it'd be a bad idea
but if he wants to make a point about
free speech he should invite both biden
and well okay or whoever he's running
against
okay that's the way to do it
he should put out two invitations
and
optionally
you know again i'm not
let's have some humility let it let us
not as i've done before and i think i
have to correct myself on this i think i
need some humility about anything that i
suggested joe rogan do in his own domain
but one way to go would be to say
uh i'm inviting um
all of the candidates
so you see both sides
or or just whoever says yes
right
or whoever says yes he does have the uh
the clout that he could do both he could
just do back to back
somebody says rogan isn't a trump fan
perfect
perfect
and that's why you want to watch him
right
that the reason you watch joe rogan is
that you believe that what he says is
true you know what's the interesting
thing about both of rogan's let's say
apologies if you want to call that both
of his videos sort of explaining his
situation
is that you believe them
think about how weird that is
now you might you might have criticized
you know the form of them or the timing
or whether whether people should
apologize those are different questions
but was there any ever even one moment
in either of those videos
where you thought he wasn't talking from
his actual honest
opinion and the answer is no
think think think about anybody else who
could do that
who else could pull that off
seriously
who else could pull off
both of those videos and nobody even his
i don't even think his biggest critics
said it was not sincere
if you can't even get your critics to
say you're lying
you're doing something right
and on that note
we will talk to you
tomorrow and have i mentioned
how good looking you are
and how bright
and caring
see you tomorrow
