[Music]
good morning everybody
and congratulations on another
successful
morning
uh and this is coffee with scott adams
the highlight of civilization
and wouldn't you like to take it to the
next level
next level that's right all you need is
a copper marker elastic thank you stein
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
who likes coffee i do
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
unparalleled i say it's the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better
and watch how your day
goes from who knows what the way you
started
to way better than that after the
simultaneous sip it happens almost
instantly go
checking yup
yup
it worked again
i don't know how it does it
really
well i had an interesting spiritual
experience yesterday
that lasted half of the day
it was the damnedest thing
i'm going to tell you about it
but
i'm completely aware
that you might not care at all
i'm still going to tell you
because there's something in here that
might be useful to you
like really useful
like really really really useful
there's a reframe
in here
now some of you might know
that my pandemic's been a little
difficult
i uh going through a divorce i've got a
cat with cancer who's going to be
checking out
probably in a few weeks
i've got a dog who's past her expiration
date she's she's healthy but
she might have another year
and uh things are
things are a little difficult at the
moment
and yesterday i was
driving along and actually i was taking
a walk in the nice
sunshine and
felt really good
and
i randomly was listening to some music
in my headphones and a song by peter
gabriel came on
salisbury hill
and apparently he wrote this song when
he was he had a spiritual he calls it
a spiritual um
experience
he went on top of this hill called
salisbury hill
and he doesn't say if he was taking any
hallucinogens but
i'm thinking maybe
and i'm going to give you the lyrics of
the song and they're gonna tell you the
reframe that happened with me at the
same time
every once in a while you know how a
song will
hit you at exactly the time that you
need it
and maybe it's just the way you
interpret it
so i'm gonna read these lyrics
and i want to see how you interpret them
because some interpret them as
something about god
other people interpreted it as
something else
i know that when i heard it i cried and
i didn't even know why and i had to go
look up the lyrics and it took me a
while to like piece together what was
going on
and
here's what he said
uh so here are the lyrics from his
spiritual experience
climbing up on salisbury hill i could
see the city light
wind was blowing time stood still
eagle flew out of the night he was
something to observe came in close i
heard a voice
standing stretching every nerve had to
listen had no choice
i did not believe the information
just had to trust imagination
my heart going boom boom boom son he
said
grab your things i've come to take you
home
to keep in silence i resigned my friends
would think i was a nut turning water
into wine open doors would soon be shut
so i went from day to day through though
my life was in a rut
until i thought of what i'd say which
connection i should cut
i was feeling part of the scenery
um
ah i walked right out of the machinery
my heart going boom boom boom
hey you said
grab your things i've come to take you
home
i back home
when illusion
spinner net
i'm never where i want to be and liberty
she pirouettes
when i think i am free watched my empty
silhouettes
who close their eyes but still can see
no one taught them etiquette
i will show them another me
today i don't need a replacement i'll
tell them um that the smile on my face
meant my heart going boom boom boom hey
i said you can keep my things you've
they've come to take me home
so
here's the reframe
you're probably thinking
that you're seeing tears of sadness
but actually you're not
you're seeing tears of joy
which is what i experienced yesterday i
didn't think it would happen when i
reread that that kind of caught me by
surprise
but here's the reframe
everything ends poorly
that's it
everything ends poorly
if you fell in love and stayed together
your whole life
one of you is gonna die
first
and then the other one will die
you don't really have the option of
things ending well
things could be longer they can be
shorter but they don't end well
never
and once you realize that
it can help you put things into a better
perspective and here's the reframe
if it was ever good
it was worth doing and here's the way to
to ask yourself
if you regret it
if you had a choice of going back
and you could remove the memory and all
the pain
your whole memory of it could be gone
all the pain all the memory of it
but
in order to do that
the deal would be you'd have to forget
the good stuff
whatever it was that you liked about it
at one point
so you couldn't
you you couldn't get rid of the bad
memories unless you got rid of the good
ones and here's the question
would you do it
would you get rid of the bad memories
at the expense of the good ones
if your answer is no
then you didn't lose anything
you didn't lose anything
and what happened to me when somehow the
the
accidental connection of that song
which has very let's say ambiguous
meaning you probably all read something
into it that was different
but you know i have this this feeling
that
i live in a simulation
and that the model that makes most sense
to me the one that seems to explain my
situation
is that there seem to be levels like a
game
and that you can't go to the next level
until you solve a problem
that is thrown at you continuously at
your current level
and have you noticed that some problems
just seem to repeat until you solve them
like the supply chain problems are going
on right now
but also in your personal life
it seems like you get the same problem
over and over again
and
as i was thinking about this reframe and
thinking to myself
wouldn't i be better off to have had
this
with a poor ending than to have never
had it
and
a lot of people had been giving me you
know sympathy and empathy for going
through a divorce
but the truth is
that for much of the time that i was
married or with christina
that my average day was
even my bad day was better than your
best day
how do i feel bad about that
like how do i feel bad that i went
through a period where
on some days things were so good i
couldn't even explain it it was like
beyond explanation
but everything ends
and then something will begin and i'll
tell you what i felt
which is that in order to get to the
next level
which feels like what happened i mean at
least in some mental model way
um
i had to get to forgiveness
right whenever whenever there's a
relationship
everybody's blaming everybody for
everything you get to that point
but until you get to forgiveness
it feels like you're locked into some
kind of hell
and yesterday as i was listening to the
song i was thinking about
why am i like why am i having bad
thoughts about something that was
amazing
for so long
my first my first marriage the same
thing
like i wouldn't trade her for anything
even though it didn't didn't end well
but i wouldn't trade it
because i'd have to get rid of the good
memories
and so i felt this overwhelming feeling
of forgiveness
which freed me
from some kind of a prison
that i maybe i didn't even know i was in
and so that happened to me yesterday and
if it helps
to think of that reframe which will
probably be in the book i'm writing as
part of the book
then i offer that to you so i offer you
my experience
as one that maybe maybe you can have as
well
but
when you uh
when you find yourself in a tough time
you know it's the end of something good
something that you you know had a lot of
value in even a life
you know you might my stepson died of an
overdose a few years ago so even even
those tragic things you can say you know
i wouldn't i wouldn't trade the good
parts
so i'll give you that to start
well uh
this is coincidentally related in a
weird way
apparently pete davidson is
in discussions with jeff bezos rocky
company
blue origin to go up in space
now the other thing that pete davidson
is
getting a lot of attention for is dating
kim kardashian which apparently kanye
west
who i call yay
doesn't like that too much so you've
probably seen that in the news some back
and forth
but
i wondered if kanye west
has had his
moment of forgiveness yet or if he will
be hoping that
that rocket blows up with pete davidson
in it
and i was thinking to myself
you know a week ago
a week ago i would have been
i would have been hoping for the rocket
to blow up just to get pete davison even
if it killed like five
five innocent people
you know you go through your dark
your dark thoughts
and you're thinking the worst possible
thing
well i think kanye has not quite worked
through his
his trauma
and i can't imagine the thoughts that
would be going through his head
as pete davidson is not only
sleeping with the mother of his children
but is also getting all this attention
for going into space
i think if i were in kanye's head space
i would actually be hoping for that
thing to explode
and
i don't know it's a weird situation tom
brady decided he's not going to retire
after all he's coming back for another
season at least
which is interesting because as jeff
pilkington pointed down on twit twitter
somebody paid 518 000 for the last
touchdown football that tom brady threw
well
i don't know if the value of the last
football
is going to go down a little bit when
it's no longer the last football
but
i was wondering how anybody was going to
handle that situation
and i thought there's a perfect solution
he should take his football
then he bought for 518 000
and he should see if tom brady will just
you know take a sharpie
and write on the football oops
or or sorry
and just that just oops and i think it
would double this value to a million
dollars
well let's talk about all the probable
fake news i'll start with probable fake
news that russia asked china for
military support
anybody
do you think russia asked china for
military support
the examples given were financial
support
which you could argue as military
support you know given that
the war caused the sanctions which
caused the
need for it
uh and then they're also talking to them
about drones
do you believe that
do you think russia is talking about
buying drones from china
i feel like no
right
first of all would we really know that
i mean i i know we have spies
but would we really know that that
conversation was going on i don't know
i feel not
this feels totally made up to me
elon musk tweeted i hereby challenge
vladimir putin to single combat the
stakes are ukraine
what
did he really tweet that
elon musk actually
uh challenged putin to us
[Laughter]
oh i hope that's true
please be true
please be true
oh that would be amazing
can you imagine the pay-per-view on that
i don't even know who i'd bet on
i don't know
unless elon musk is taking some you know
karate classes or something we don't
know about
he said he's serious
well i don't think i don't think ukraine
is going to take that bet
oh well so i'm going to say it's fake
that russia asked china for military
support
they might have asked them to buy more
more oil or something
um here's another one you know the story
about the
the hospital that was bombed in ukraine
and there was a pregnant woman
who was taken away in a stretcher
and that story looked really really fake
well
now we hear that the pregnant woman
um and her baby died
uh but nobody got her name
so
pregnant woman and her baby died
but nobody got her name
i'm not so sure i believe that story
now i'm not saying that there aren't
horrible tragic things happening because
it looks like there are a lot of them so
there's no question about the horror and
the tragedy but this specific story
this specific story is once again
a little bit too on the nose
a little bit too on the nose i'm going
to say no
probably i mean it could be there's
nothing that would rule it out from
being possible
but it's a little too
propagandy-ish purple purpose or perfect
all right how about the video did you
see the video of the russian tank firing
on a residential apartment building
how many of you saw that video today
tank russian tank firing on a
residential
building
do you know what was left out of the
story
the why
why were they shooting on a residential
building
do you think it was just a residence
full of people minding their own
business
well if you see the video
you can see that this apartment building
is the high ground
for that entire area
so there's a whole bunch of low
buildings
on the approach
but then there's one you know
multi-story building
that is the obvious place
for the snipers and the people with the
anti-tank weapons it's the most obvious
place they would be because it's the
high ground
so it looks to me
like the russian tanks were aiming at a
specific apartment buildings
where they probably saw something or saw
some gunfire or something
so to me it looked like they were
shooting at military targets who were
hiding in the most obvious place that
you would be
in the high ground where they have you
know the view of the field etc
so that's what it looked like
yeah the ukraine soldiers are mostly
using residential buildings you'd think
they they would just because of the
placement of them
so i'm going to say that's a fake news
only because the context was left out
now how about that big russian tank
column
did you hear the news that had dispersed
that there was a 40-mile tank column and
it dispersed and now it's basically
deployed and ready to attack and that
the artillery has gone uh into positions
in the forest where they can attack kiev
without being seen as easily
well i saw a
i forgot i wish i'd written down the
name of who said it but there's somebody
who seemed to know what they were
talking about who said no nothing was
dispersed
they just got off the road because they
were sitting ducks
they're basically hiding
on the side of the road so they're not
as obvious targets
and
that there aren't many tanks in the
column
have you ever heard that
i think i need a confirmation of that
but apparently there aren't many tanks
in the column and that the column is a
resupply column primarily
and that it had some tanks to protect it
but that the ukrainians
realizing it was a resupply column and
here's something i learned
for a military operation of this size if
they were you know actually shooting
they would need to be resupplied every
like day to two days
or they'd be out of ammo
so they can only shoot for about a
day-ish
before they run out of all the ammo that
they carry with them
and then after that is it's got to be
daily supply runs all the way back to
the post
and
so the question is
did the ukrainians
take advantage of a russian blunder by
getting in that long column by taking
out the front and back
and that's all you had to do they didn't
need to kill anybody
because they're stranded because they
don't have a lot of weapons
except these i guess they do have some
artillery but it looks like they
basically ukrainians are going to defeat
the russian army in the north
maybe
now
is it my imagination or have you started
to see
the beginning of that opinion
because i think i was the only one who
said ukraine is going to surprise on the
upside
early on
everybody else was uh 48 hours it's over
and i kept saying you know you're not
counting the weapons because they're
going to have good weapons
they're not they're not going to have
the bad stuff
and that that would probably make a
difference it looks like it is making a
difference that with the russian
blunders
and
so
um there could be 70 000 soldiers in the
north
and about the same amount in the south
and the in the east
or the west
east and west i guess
and it could be that if the ukrainians
essentially defeat the northern army
it's half of russia's invading force
what happens does the south keep going
or do the ukrainians just take that take
that victory
and then redeploy so forces to the south
have more anti-attack weapons and more
drones than ever before
and actually start beating the russians
back in the south or at least you know
back to crimea or something
yeah now russia does have the problem
that it can't go too severely on the
civilian population even though all the
so-called experts are saying they'll do
exactly that
yeah
um
all right
so keep an eye on that but here's what i
would be looking for which is more
analysts saying you know you know
ukraine might actually win this war
you're going to start seeing it
doesn't mean they will but i think
people will start talking about it in
those at least as a possibility
well back to covid south korea's
infections are through the roof or at
least in terms of percentage increase
um
and there's concern now that all those
countries that did really well during
covid are just going to get slammed by
omicron
so
south korea is having their problems
china's got these
uh problems new zealand will probably
have a problem they don't get
but i saw some video of these china
quarantine camps where apparently china
is cranking out all these little
little standalone
[Music]
it's about the size of a two dumpsters i
guess
and
they'll put somebody in there it's got a
little toilet room and a bed
a table
and they just stick them in there and
they can't leave for two weeks or
whatever it is
it looks really
it looks really
inhuman
and you know somebody said that there
are millions of them i doubt there are
millions of them
but is there any chance that these
countries that weren't infected early
are going to get away with it
it looks like they're going to have
major problems and again what would be
the impact
if asia
gets you know just hit hard with omicron
and they're trying to kill it by
shutting down everything
it's the supply chain again
is it a coincidence that we're seeing
one after another supply chain problems
when we've never really had them before
and then suddenly it's just all supply
chain supply chain
i don't know
looks like something's being tested here
so
our reality of course has split into two
worlds you're familiar with the
johns hopkins study that said masks and
social distancing didn't make any
difference
and i guess
rand paul is introducing something that
would get rid of fauci's position in the
future and put it in three organizations
and according to rand paul and according
to the johns hopkins study
masks and all the lockdown stuff totally
didn't work
now in the other reality
that is just as robust
just as robust
if you go to huffington post
they will tell you just matter of factly
that masks
and distancing totally worked and
there's all kinds of science to prove it
did
what's true
i don't know
how did how did asia
manage to escape the worst of it if none
of that stuff works
was it just the testing
was that it was it the testing alone
that allowed china to and south korea to
get away with it
or
is it blindingly obvious that distance
plus masking must have made a big
difference
because in asia they're probably a
little more fastidious about wearing the
masks and more more places
it works so good it isn't working now
well remember uh the masks everybody
agrees
that they're not going to work that much
for omicron
so the possibility is that they worked
great for the earlier versions they
don't work at all for omicron but it
would still say they worked up until now
so
i don't know what do you think
do you think the sciences
is totally in and the mass worked or the
science is totally in the mass didn't
work
i don't know
beats me
doesn't matter
um at this point
but that's just one example of where our
reality is
um
really hard to discern and
here's what here's what's changed in
recent years i did a
viral threat on this
and what changed is everybody
understands that we've been duped by all
the experts all the time
it used to be it used to be that we
thought the other team was being duped
but our team whatever our team was for
you but that your team
was not being duped only the other guys
they're falling for all kinds of hoaxes
what's different
is i believe that both teams now
understand that all we're seeing is fake
news
from both sides
because you know you can see the
the liberals waking up to it every day
so would you agree that that change has
happened that people understand it's not
just the other team being hypnotized
right
i'm not imagining that we do know that
it's happening to us as well as other
people
now in that
environment what the hell do you do
there and as i said the thread there's
there are no trusted truth-tellers
anymore
there's nobody who's just a person
in any kind of a job
that you would say to yourself well you
know they might be wrong about some
things but at least i trust them they're
not going to lie to me
and and i would put myself in the
non-credible category with everybody
else
because we're in a world where even if
even if
by some miracle i was the only person
who never lied to you you wouldn't know
that
you know even if even if somebody was
the only reliable truth teller and maybe
it could be me
even if it were me
you wouldn't know it
because somebody would tell you i wasn't
in fact right now i i believe i have the
best prediction record in the country by
far
but if you were to read people's
comments about me they'd say the
opposite
so which is true
see it wouldn't even matter if you had a
good truth teller
it wouldn't matter if somebody could
actually do the job because nobody would
believe them
so what are you going to do
so i've suggested that there should be
something like a supreme court of
reality
in other words actually trying to
develop a system
that maybe isn't right all the time
but like a court trial
you come up with a system to find out
what is true and what is false
won't work every time but work way
better than whatever we're doing
better than guessing
and
um i saw russ garber say that maybe it
should be more like a regular trial as
opposed to a supreme court model but i
do think that one of those models or
some version of it
should be employed
so that we have something that the
public can look at and say you know
maybe they don't get every one of them
right
but the supreme court of truth did rule
that this is fake news
or they did rule that it's out of
context
and then there's a
um
and then there would be a minority
opinion
so that you'd always have access to the
minority opinion
just like with the supreme court
so i don't think it's like the supreme
court or like a regular jury trial but
you might look to them for some elements
that you could put together
now here's here's a little uh
story i like to tell
whenever you ask yourself is it even
possible to design a system that would
be fair
given human
psychology
and i always give this example as some
of you have heard
suppose you were a drug dealer
and you were buying some marijuana
and you wanted to split it with whoever
invested with you
so you got a big pile of marijuana and
you want to split it but you don't have
a scale and even if you did have a scale
you'd still argue about who had the
better buds and you know whatever
so how do you divide it
if the two of you want it to look fair
so you want to both feel like it was
fair
but
you don't have a way to measure it
well there is it turns out an easy
system
and the system is that one person
divides up the piles
and then the other person picks a pile
so the cleverness of the system is it
removes your ability to complain
because the person who divided the piles
in the first place can't complain
they're the one who divided the pile and
the one who chooses one of those pilots
can't complain because they got their
choice
and they got to look at them before they
chose
so sometimes you can be surprised
how a
unsolvable looking problem can be solved
before the constitution of the united
states was created
how many people thought you couldn't do
it
i don't know but i'm guessing a lot of
people said you know don't even try it's
just going to be dictators forever it's
the only thing that works there's no way
you're going to build a system
that gives you
fair fair outcomes and everybody agrees
it's a fair system
but we did it
it worked
we actually built a system which most
people think is credible now it's not
perfect
it's not perfect for anything
all right
um
so how would you divide devise such a
thing
the first thing you do is i don't think
you could have
the same people making the decisions all
the time would you agree with that
so probably you don't want the supreme
court model exactly because you don't
want people appointed for life you
wouldn't trust them right so the first
part of the system is it's got to be
some kind of a rotating group
the second part of the system is
there should be at least
some experts involved
in the in their decision so you know
maybe you have a different group for
every category
but you should have some people who are
outside the group
and have good skills at criticizing and
analyzing
but also some people know what they're
talking about plus some other experts
etc
so i feel like you could come up with a
system where you would at least know
that a group
of people who had been selected just for
this question had looked into it
carefully and that by a
by a majority of you know nine to three
the group had voted that this is true
news or
uh
fake news
what do you think
yeah it basically would be a fake news
slash reality committee
but
here's the thing as long as that group
rotates you could revisit some things
that people didn't like
so let's say they you know day one the
group gets together and says masks
totally work
but then a let's say a new study comes
out
maybe maybe if there's new information
they go back and they rule it again
possibly with a new team
possibly with a new team
and then you would know something you
didn't know right
if the reality team had said it's true
and then later they changed and reversed
and said it's false that tells you
something
it either tells you something new
information is important
where it tells you that we don't really
know on this one could go either way
i'm saying that i was approached about a
blockchain system for solving this now i
would need more than that because
blockchain doesn't tell me
why the system would work
so there has to be some balance of
interest and
and transparency and all that so i think
it could be done and i would say
uh the dumbest idea ever in all caps
somebody says
and i think that the constitution
did not foresee the degree of fake news
that we're experiencing today especially
the the weaponized ai search engine kind
of fake news
and that we actually need something like
another
branch of the constitution
now if you could do it without getting
the government involved that'd be great
but how does that work
unfortunately the market system which
normally corrects
imbalances
is creating the imbalance
because as long as the psychology of
people is that we'll look at fake news
before we look at real news because the
fake news is more interesting
as long as that's the case
what the hell are you going to do
i'm seeing lots of uh
divorce questions on on youtube let me
just say one thing i'm not going to be
talking about my personal situation
beyond you know the most general
statements
um but you should assume
that in the world where everything is
fake
that whatever you're thinking or
assuming about my personal situation
there's no way you're right
because if you're thinking it falls into
some like easy category we say well
that's obviously one of these or one of
the no
it's definitely complicated
so if there's one thing i could tell you
even i don't know what went wrong
that's and that's legitimately true i
have no idea
it's so complicated that
i don't think the people involved even
though
like i could give you 12 reasons
why something ended
and i wouldn't believe any of them but
they sound pretty good right and i think
that's always the case i told you this
about movies
one of the smartest things i heard about
movies is that when you don't like a
movie it looks like every part of it was
bad
that acting the
casting it was all bad
but when the movie is good you think wow
every part of that was good
but neither of those are true
usually
so it's the same with any kind of
complicated
any kind of complicated situation
whether it's a relationship or a movie
anyway
you really don't know why things went
the way they went
obama
has a covet
he's got a scratchy throat
it could be because uh michelle changed
her strap-on maybe i don't know
or it could be covered
i'm just kidding
i knew you'd laugh at that stupid joke
just kidding
all right
well here's the best news for california
potentially michael shellenberger is
running for governor of california
now i've spoken of michael many times
because he's probably the most
productive
non-elected person in the country
meaning that he's he's worked hard on
promoting nuclear as a
solution for everything from clean
energy to climate change and now the
world has gone his way
he turned his focus and wrote a huge
best-selling book san francisco
about the the homeless and the addiction
problem
dug into what works and what doesn't and
came up with a set of you know a
prescription for fixing it that is based
on human nature
surprise
right because when the democrats are
involved they usually ignore human
nature
when they build their systems and then
of course they don't work
but
michael schellenberger who had
been registered democrat for most of his
life decided to become an independent
because he didn't like what he was
seeing in either party basically
but
he's
laser focused
on looking at
systems that work
not just goals
but systems
and
and he's really really good at finding
out which systems worked where and why
and then breaking it down to their
simple elements to say we should do this
and not do that so he's got
prescriptions from everything from you
know addictions to homeless
to
the
forest fires to energy
and they're all
detailed
they're very detailed
very specific based on things that work
in other places
and how would you pick the guy who's
done everything wrong
newsome
i mean all the big issues he got wrong
it looks like
so how do you pick the person who got
who has detailed solutions that look
totally practical
well the problem is if he runs as an
independent he doesn't have party
support
but did you know
that there are basically three parties
in california if you count independents
and the independents are the biggest
party
so i think the independents are bigger
than either the democrats or the
republicans
and he's running as an independent now
can he make that work as an independent
because that's that's the tough thing
right
it's hard to get
elected as an independent
but i don't know if it's this hard after
california has failed so badly on so
many
you know big issues
so certainly the door is open
now the other thing that michael
schellenberger has going for him and
running for governor is
um
me
and other people helping him of course
so he has a lot of support from people
who've been watching him for a long time
and know that he can produce
if he didn't know he could produce
you know i wouldn't be as full-throated
in my endorsement but this is one this
is one case where i could say
unambiguously this is really a clean
this is a clean decision
there's just no way he's not the right
choice there's just no way this is
really easy
doesn't mean he gets elected
but it would be a easy decision for
people who looked into it
while amazon has decided to relocate
some of his offices from downtown
seattle because it's too dangerous
seattle is so crime-ridden in parts of
it because the
defund the police and whatnot that even
amazon's moving out there was a
mcdonald's that closed
frickin mcdonald's closed how often does
that happen i think it happened one
other time
so seattle's a mess
falling apart
and
i say to you
people
people of the world
if we could get ourselves some kind of a
supreme court of truth
and we could get ourselves a michael
schellenberger
governor in california
and we can
get ourselves out of the last mandates
of this pandemic
and we can
put the pain on putin
without a nuclear war
and we can use the
the putin situation as a way to get more
energy independent
i feel like
it might look like things are going to
hell
but we are really in a pretty good
situation except for inflation
i have one remaining big
worry
and that's inflation i don't quite know
how that plays out except that i guess
it is a tax
without
i guess you could say it's a tax
now the other possibility is that there
is a
transient portion of this
well there is a transient portion so i
think if you get past the ukraine
situation you get past covet
the
if we can get our supply chain working i
think we're fine
i think we'll be in good shape
um
somebody's asking me a question that i'm
going to give you a generic answer i
don't live with regret
and that's part of the reframe
if you ever enjoyed it
then you got what you wanted
if it turns bad at the end
everything does every company goes out
of business
it just takes a while
some companies might take 300 years but
they're going out of business oh they're
going out of business
and you know every relationship ends
because people die at the very least
you're gonna die
so um
don't ask about regret i don't have
any uh
and let me let me put it in the most
stark terms
both of my marriages
totally worth it
totally worth it i would do it again in
a heartbeat
no matter how they end
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is
no doubt the best
thing you've ever seen
in your life
and
the news has largely stopped because
there's nothing but inflation in ukraine
and
the lingering covet issues and
we're talked about those too much
i think also that you're going to see a
huge
change in
rare minerals
do you believe that the rare minerals
only seem to exist in the places that
are hard to get at them
why is that
do you do you think we don't have rare
minerals anywhere in the united states
it
is pollution based
is that the reason we don't do it here
because it would be too polluty
somebody says the u.s has plenty
yeah era
maybe
but yeah i think those are technical
problems that are likely to be solved
yeah the dollar has left its position as
the sole means of trade
but let me ask you this
would you rather have a dollar or a
or whatever
ruble
i don't think it's close yet is it
wouldn't everybody still rather have a
dollar
oh did bill maher already go into
ben shapiro
i'll go watch oh it would it be the the
one
why i told you ukraine will win
day two why do westerners not believe in
ukraine oh okay
troll
um
all right i'll go watch that uh ben
shapiro thing
did shapiro use the really frame with
bill maher
did he
did that actually happen
you know the the really frame is where
you go really
really
really
uh yes he did okay
we'll have to watch that just to see
that
yeah shapiro is
somebody says ben shapiro is a genius
but it's funny that's not like a
compliment it's just a description
because he's like literally a genius
so you think the dollar is done soon i
don't know i'm i'm not betting against
the dollar if you bet against the dollar
you're
that's
it's a pretty uh contrarian bet i think
yeah the dollar the dollar only has to
be better than the other ones
that's that's the thing right it only
has to be better than the alternatives
it doesn't have to be great it could be
degraded by a lot it just has to be
better
the frame used in reference to trump
oh the really frame used in preference
to trump by okay all right i'll go watch
that all right i got nothing else for
you today
no doubt this was the highlight of your
life and i'll see you tomorrow
all right tomorrow it is
