good morning everybody
come on in come on in this will be
the best coffee with scott adams
ever and i'm talking about since the
beginning of time
15 billion years since the start of the
universe
and this will be the best one that's
right
well some of you know that i had surgery
yesterday and while i would not normally
talk about my
health conditions on periscope
i feel i need to because i've been
sharing this with you and
you all had to suffer through my
sniffling
and my complaining and i thank you for
it so number one
thank you thank you for putting up with
my blowing my nose on camera
pretty much every time thank you for the
nasal sounds that you put up with i
really appreciate it i mean that
um secondly yesterday was one of the
best
freaking days of my whole life i gotta
say
which sounds weird right because i was
literally in surgery
so yesterday around noon or so i got
pulled into surgery
for these um polyps i have in my sinus
which if you imagine your sinuses are
like
caves the polyps would be like the
stalactites
except more bulbous and if you have
enough of them and i guess they're just
genetic some people get them some people
don't it blocks up your sinuses
you lose your your your taste you can
lose your hearing
temporarily yeah you know and you become
stuffed up and you can't breathe and all
that so anyway i uh
had them taken care of i got in my head
and snipped them out
uh bandaged it up
i thought that when i woke up because
you know i was under general anesthesia
i thought when i woke up i wouldn't be
able to breathe through my nose
because it'd be all packed with you know
gauze and stuff up in my sinuses
but the doctor was very impressed
with how bad i was meaning that
there were so many polyps in my sinuses
it was some kind of a world record i
guess
according to me that when he removed
them
even adding in the bandages and even
accounting for the swelling i can
breathe better than i can ever breathe
in my life
breathing through my nose day after
surgery
so that was exciting but i got to tell
you what was
so much what was great about the whole
day
number one i've been socially isolating
for
forever right and i had to do two
serious weeks
of really bad social isolation meaning
as a newlywed i did not even
touch my bride for two weeks so
i was a little bit starved for human
contact of any kind and i'm being
completely serious
so being fussed over by doctors and
nurses and you know it's a whole team
coming in and out and they're they're
adjusting things and there's poking you
with things
and even though every single thing they
did
hurt you know like even when they put
the tape on
they tape it so it hurts and they put
the needle in it hurts a little bit
well almost everything they did was hurt
a little bit
but i was so excited to be around
human beings within within touching
distance
and of course they were all dressed like
beekeepers right i mean they had the
full
the full protective gear on there's not
one of those people i would recognize
if i saw them today if i saw them today
i only saw their eyes the whole time but
they were very nice
very professional so anyway then they
they fill you up with uh fentanyl and
they wheel you in
i i of course don't remember any of that
i woke up
not knowing who i was or where i was but
i could breathe
and if this works meaning that if i
recover and it's still as good as it is
now
this is such a life-changing
event for me because i've actually never
been able to breathe through my nose
not as a child not at any time i had a
deviated septum i fixed that it didn't
help i had allergies
i thought that was a problem couldn't
get those under control
but this this actually just bulldozed
the highway so we should work now it's
not permanent so i might have to do it
again someday in 10 years or something
but at the moment i could not be happier
i got home
and you know christina had waited for me
the entire time and she was
she was uh taking care of me when i got
home because you can't
you can't do too much you don't want to
drive or do anything that would be
include lifting or thinking so
then christina fusses over me in a good
way you know
taking care of me and
i just had a really good day
and the whole time that i was in the
hospital
it was such a newsy day there was so
much news
and i had surgery was delayed a while
so i was just on my phone you know
tweeting and looking at the news and
doing exactly what i would have done
except when it was in a really
comfortable like bed with this warm and
warm blanket on
and people people being nice to me and i
was like this is way better than being
home
this is way better than social isolation
and so i just had a terrific day it was
so good
that uh last night christina was making
sure that i
you know was still um cognizant enough
to take
the right meds at the right time and she
was
suggesting that i take the uh was it the
tylenol whatever it is the one with
codeine
that knocks you out she said we'll take
that one around bedtime
that'll just knock you right out 20
minutes you'll be gone
so i'm like perfect 20 minutes i'm going
to be sound asleep
well i'm still waiting so i've been up
for 24 hours straight i haven't even
been close to sleep
because i'm just not even a little bit
tired
i think part of it is because i slept
all afternoon on the uh
during surgery and i've never heard of
this
i don't know do you actually get a good
rest when you're
when you're uh you're in surgery i don't
know
but anyway i don't have any pain today i
can breathe
for the first time in my life i don't
have my sense of smell back
i understand that might come around
slowly but
i could not be happier today i just
wanted to share it with you and also
thank you for putting up with it i think
my voice will change
uh i don't know how maybe maybe you hear
it already
all right let's talk about some other
things enough about me there's so much
news
look at this look at that so much news
uh let me read you some tweets that i
thought were extra clever
this one from twitter user cambrie
at kamv tv
this is one of the most clever tweets
i've seen in a long time
i don't know if she got it from somebody
i think she made it up but it's great
and it goes like this
i remember when the news used to tell us
what happened
and we had to decide what to think about
it now the news tells us how to think
about something
and then we have to decide if it
happened
that's true isn't it it used to be they
tell you the facts and then you decide
what you thought about it
now they tell you what to think and
you're not sure if those facts actually
happened
this is a really clever tweet so
kudos to cambrie
um i tweeted yesterday that trump had
one of the best
tweets of his entire tweeting life and i
was going to tell you what i liked about
it so here's the tweet from trump and
then i'll break it down for you
he said germany pays russia billions of
dollars a year
for energy and we are supposed to
protect germany from russia
what's that all about also germany is
very delinquent
and there are 2 feet of nato we are
therefore removing some troops
and of germany so the point of the tweet
is to announce that he's moving some but
not all troops out of germany
but the first part of the tweet is
really good
just in terms of engineering you know a
tweet
let me tell you why if you were to try
to describe to somebody
in a long form what the situation is
it would take you a number of sentences
maybe a paragraph or so
you know like why is it that we care
that germany is buying any of its energy
from russia
because you'd have to understand that
that would give them a security
susceptibility because you know russia
could just turn off
the energy at the same time that germany
is part of nato
which is supposed to be protecting all
of our countries and nato
against russia germany is making
themselves
especially vulnerable to russia
now it takes a little while to explain
it because there are several moving
parts
so the way trump does it and you've seen
this technique i think from me
from mike cernovich from other people
who
uh tend to get a lot of retweets
and he does it with a question
so by putting a question in a tweet it
turbo charges it
you'll see you'll see a lot of us do
that who know how to do this sort of
thing
so let me read it again so you can see
how provocative how cleverly
he takes a complicated thing compacts it
into
you know just the first part of a tweet
because he needed the rest of the tweet
to explain what he was up to
so he compacts it into two sentences
that are just about as perfect
as you could write these two sentences
first of all it's direct sentences all
right
very direct look look how quickly this
sentence
tells you what's happening oh did i
forget the simultaneous if it's coming
up after this
um look how directly he gets to it
germany pays russia billions boom
that is a simple direct statement now
you know what you're talking about
germany pays russia billions of dollars
a year for energy
perfect and we're supposed and he says
and we are supposed to protect
germany from russia what's that all
about
now the what's that all about part is
is the the magic of it so the first part
is perfect
because it's clean it's direct it's
simple which is hard to do
if you try to write a sentence that
clean and that simple
a little harder than you think i'll get
to the sip in a moment
but the what's it all about is the magic
part because that's the part that
invites you to figure it out like it's a
little bit of a puzzle
but it's not enough of a puzzle that
you're not going to be able to figure it
out
so you have to spend some time on it if
you want somebody to really remember
what you did you have to make them spend
time on it
you can't let them go zoop and onto the
next thing it won't be retained
so by putting in the form of a question
what's that all about
you actually answer the question well
what is that all about oh okay i'm
putting this
putting all the pieces together all
right so that was his tweet
it was quite excellent but i know you're
here for the simultaneous sip and it's
coming up
it's coming up now and all you need is a
copper margarita glass of anchor tells
us stein a canteen jogger flask a vessel
of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
dope being hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the coronavirus
the economy yeah racism everything go
ahead
i feel my nasal polyps healing even as
we sit here
amazing really um
if you watched tucker carlson last night
you know that he uh and and if you also
follow
mike cernovich on twitter you know that
tucker
used mike cernovich's scoop
about a memo that he got a hold of a
republican memo
that has been characterized as
republicans deciding to go easy on the
tech companies
now i think there's room for
interpretation but that's
that was the essence of the story
and here's the part that bugs the hell
out of me
as mike cernovich pointed out on twitter
tucker uses his scoop which i didn't see
anywhere else
i didn't see anybody else have that
scoop except from
mike and he doesn't mention mike
cernovich's name
on the show as as the person who came up
with the scoop
now that is not standard that's not
standard behavior
i don't think or at least it shouldn't
be
and i got a real problem with that
because
the entire context of yesterday was the
big media companies
essentially censoring or
you know what's the word uh suppressing
certain voices and then tucker did it
that's literally what tucker did he
suppressed mike cernovich's
voice by not giving him attention when
it was clearly
appropriate to do so which would have
been you know presumably
good for mike in whatever ways that
attention is good for people who
operate in the public and sell books and
stuff
so um
so that bothered me i just wanted to
point that out and give mike a shout out
for that and we'll talk more about that
um
in no particular order if you're if
you're not following
undercover hoover on on twitter you
probably should
it's uh at john w huber h-u-b-e-r
and he tweets this and the reason
the reason that this got my attention is
because the whole
russia collusion story was so
complicated
and it already feels like it was 10
years ago
that as new information dribbles out
it's hard for your brain to
take these new dribbles and connect them
with this complicated story that already
feels 10 years old even though it isn't
and so and so you can sort of miss the
big picture
just in the details here's one that i
missed
so ask yourself if ask yourself if you
knew this
so undercover hubert tweets i'm not sure
everyone had fully internalized yet
which is an understatement that
i'm not sure everyone had fully
internalized yet the steels meaning this
you know the steel uh dossier the
steel's primary sub
source was directly on his payroll
what what
payments were laundered through a front
company and the source was dependent on
that income from steel to maintain his
work permit to live in the united states
what are you kidding me
how did i not know that
so oh somebody's saying if uh
if cernovich got it uh why couldn't
tucker have gotten it well he could have
and then he might have mentioned where
it came from so he didn't mention where
it came from
in any event and we're left assuming
that
but if but if your criticism is that
that i can't know that for sure
that he didn't have some other source
that's true i can't know that with 100
certainly
but 90
all right uh so the fact that the steele
dossier and the whole russia collusion
thing
was based on steel paying his getting
information from his own employee
or basically a guy that he he gives
income to
it's just it's just the worst
worst situation and
i saw something about
who was the head of the cia there what's
his name
i can't remember his name but
he was writing the book and then he
didn't have access to his notes because
he lost his security clearance
what was the ex-head of the cia's name
[Music]
uh why am i blanking on that doesn't
matter
um so i don't know how people don't go
to jail for all this stuff
how do people not go to jail no it
wasn't clapper brennan yeah
so brennan i guess is uh writing a book
but he doesn't have access to his own
notes from the period when he was
ahead of the cia because i guess trump
trump said he couldn't have him
which which is probably just spite but
it's funny
he had that coming um
so espn had a story about the nba
academies in china did you see that
so the nba apparently started these
academies
where they would work with young chinese
basketball players to try to develop
them to try to to get some superstars in
china
because if they could get some you know
local chinese superstars
and import them to the nba then china
would watch
the nba so it was a good good business
move but it turns out that
and this isn't funny except that it's
funny
i feel terrible laughing at this i might
have to wait until i'm not laughing
anymore so i can
so i can say it but so
uh apparently the local chinese coaches
who were part of the academy so there
would be some i guess american who would
be
you know they had but then there would
be the subsidiary coaches
and the i guess the local chinese
coaches
uh if you don't do a good job they hit
you
[Laughter]
they hit you they like like punch them
they'll kick them and punch them so
these guys these chinese basketball
players are trying to you know play
basketball and they
you know if they fumble the ball the
coach will come over and punch him
so here's here's the mba
you know first of all they get they get
sort of a bad reputation just for being
subservient to china
in general so so they're already behind
the ball so to speak
being subservient to china because
that's obviously
not a popular thing in america but then
to find out that they're running
academies of uh of child abuse
in china just couldn't be more
perfect anyway by the way if i start
bleeding
don't worry because i'm supposed to be
bleeding for another day or so
um
anyway so espn basically threw the nba
under a bus with a story about their nba
academies and the
the players getting uh abused and
there's nothing funny about anybody
getting hit but what's funny is just how
how awful this is it's just it's
if imagine being the commissioner of the
nba and you wake up one day and you're
like oh well let's see what's in the
news
check espn yeah espn
uh-oh apparently i'm the head of a child
abuse
uh ring so that was probably a bad day
for the commissioner
all right uh you of course all saw the
tech ceos ceos being interviewed by
congress
oh my god that was quite a thing now i
didn't see all of it but i
saw the important points and here's the
thing that's a real
there's something happening now let me
just say this as a general comment
there's something happening with reality
in the world now
that people can know something is true
and that thing can be extraordinarily
important
and we will act like it's not there have
you seen that
it feels like there are all these
stories of things we just act like are
not there
for example the russia collusion thing
it was obviously a coup
to overthrow the legally elected
president of the united states
why isn't that in the news every day
that feels like a big thing
right so
here's here's the other thing that's a
big thing so yesterday
matt gates is interviewing or
questioning
the tech ceos and he's talking to google
ceo pinchai if i'm saying it right i
hope i am
and he he says uh to him you know
that he had testified earlier in a in
some prior
uh hearing that they did not manually
um what would be the word they did not
manually
mess with the search results in other
words the algorithm was the algorithm
and google said they didn't do anything
to promote or suppress
any political point of view that sort of
thing
so then matt gates
challenges him on that and
gets him to admit the google ceo
gets them to admit in direct language
that they do in fact
create these black lists if you will or
lists
of people to suppress and that they're
doing it
manually now
so now he admits exactly that yes it's a
manual process
which we create a list of people that
we're suppressing
and then matt gates says so you admit
you're creating a ma you're manually
creating a list
of people you're suppressing and then he
says
no no
i'm like okay let me put this in an
analogy form so you can see it better
um let's say it's not about technology
at all let's say it's a
um google ceo did you
murder a cat and
 i says no i did not
did not murder a cat
did you pick up a cat
strangle it put it in a little wooden
box and bury it
oh yeah i did that
but you're saying you didn't murder a
cat
no i didn't murder a cat okay
okay you didn't murder a cat
but you took a live cat you twisted his
neck until it wasn't alive you put it in
a box and you buried it
that you did right yeah that's what i
did
but you accused me of murdering a cat no
that's a murdering a cat
that's a cat you murdered it just say it
you murder cats i don't murder any cats
i don't know what you're talking about
i'll sometimes twist their necks put
them in a box
put them in the ground well not murder
now i think the way pinchai was trying
to
lawyer his way out of the answer
was by saying that no no it's not manual
it goes through the algorithm in other
words
they manually create a list and then the
algorithm uses it
it wasn't him using it it was the
algorithm using it
oh yeah they created a manual list for
the algorithm to use
but once the algorithm is using it i
mean it's out of their hands
right it was the most ridiculous
lie i've ever seen in public i mean just
completely ridiculous
and here's the example so we just saw
me let me finish this it gets better so
now we know
that this at least google admits they
are manually
influencing search results and therefore
obviously
um controlling elections at least to the
extent that they can suppress things and
promote things
you know for example that breitbart
basically just got
disappeared and a number of other sites
pro-trump
sites just got disappeared would that
affect
your your election of course yeah
absolutely so we have established
yesterday without any question
that the big tech companies at least
google that one
because he admitted it is and it's
obvious
is is influencing elections and they
don't plan to do anything about it
apparently
there was no no sense of oh yeah we're
going to change that
or nothing like that basically he just
acted like he was just going to keep
doing it
by simply by not saying he wasn't going
to do it
so here's the punch line so then the
the ceos were all asked if they thought
that china
was stealing uh intellectual property
and here's the fun part mark zuckerberg
said absolutely yes
facebook does not operate in china
that's important because they they have
a chinese competitor is it wechat or
something
so facebook doesn't make money from
china so zuckerberg says
yeah totally they're still an ip
so then they go to the other three ceos
who make a lot of money in china
a lot of money tim cook says
no no they haven't they haven't stolen
anything from us
it took about five minutes for somebody
on twitter
to tweet the story of an entire
artificial apple store in china there
was a fake apple store
not only did they steal you know
the iep but they recreated it in a store
a whole store that looked just like an
apple store but i had a few differences
you could tell
if it was the most ridiculous lie now
do you think there's any chance that
china isn't trying to get into
the apple technology the factories are
in their country
the apple factories are in china
yes china's getting it to apple stuff of
course
and tim cook looks right at the congress
it's like
don't know anything about that nope
then then jeff bezos gives the
weaseliest buzz smart
let me say this all four ceos geniuses
just brilliant people right so nothing
i'm going to say would detract from the
fact that these are really smart people
these are operating at the highest level
as opposed to the members of congress
like
simpson brenner or whoever it was who
looks like a like a monkey basically
talking to these guys so
then jeff bezos gives his answers like
well i've read reports
which is not answering the question
about amazon
it's it's simply saying i read reports
because we've all read reports
and he got away with that he got away
with that answer
i read some things so
that's why he's the richest guy in the
world because that was a pretty good
answer
if you're trying to avoid answering
pretty good
so that was good and then the more
interesting one was
pinchai the ceo of google
and he said no he said no
but soon after he corrected
i don't know how much time elapsed it
wasn't that much time
but later on he made sure that he
updated them and said no
um in 2009
google was hacked by china and they
stole some of our code
that's exactly what theft is
so but he wasn't going to say it
apparently until there was a published
report because apparently that had been
in the news when it happened
so it would be hard to deny something
that could be so easily
googled right i mean you just have to
use his own product
well is that true let's google china
hackers
well there it is 2009. i guess you guess
you delight
so google kind of had to correct that
because the report was out there
you know in conflict but if you see that
the three
ceos who have the most financial
interest in china
all bowed to china the one who didn't
have a financial interest
didn't what can you conclude about that
well here's what i conclude i conclude
that the tech companies can't do
anything
that china would object to because if
they did it would be a pretty big
problem
so doesn't that mean if the tech
companies are controlling our elections
and china has direct control of the tech
companies
doesn't that make china in charge of our
elections
because it does now you say to yourself
yeah it's not that direct sure china's
pushing a little influence here and
there other people are pushing a little
influence but it probably all gets lost
in the rounding right
i don't know because riddle me this
if joe biden were not running against
trump could the tech companies be so
pro-biden and anti-trump
could they get away with it because is
it a coincidence that the tech companies
are
universally supporting the most
pro-china
candidate running for president
it could be a coincidence it could be a
coincidence
but if it were not true
i think they would have to change
something in other words
if it were not conveniently luckily true
the biden is pro-china and also a
democrat so of course the
tech companies are going to favor the
democrat
what if that were not the case would
they have to make it the case
would they have to you know get another
candidate
i don't know at this point it's looking
a lot like china runs the country
now what's the solution to that turnout
the only solution to that because i
think i think that
the foreign influences and every other
influence all the
malign influences even the cheating on
you know whatever
cheating there is with ballots et cetera
voter suppression all that
if you if you count all of that some of
it's gonna you know
wash out the other but voter turnout is
sort of the only thing that's gonna
protect the country
if you don't have massive like sort of
historically high
turnout china gets to decide who the
president is
that's it if you don't have historically
like super turnout china is your daddy
because that's the way it's going to go
so there's that
you all know seth macfarlane from family
guy and
other great things i wrote about him in
my book loser think
uh because he's a perfect example of
loser think and what i mean by that is
not that he's
um unintelligent because he's actually
quite
quite intelligent he's very talented in
a number of different areas
he can sing you know he can he writes he
acts
produces directs i don't know does all
kinds of stuff
so so starting with seth macfarlane
very talented and has a really
impressive talent stack
but what he doesn't have is experience
in the fields where people make
decisions the fields such as economics
etc
and it comes through in his tweets and
i'll give you an example he tweeted this
today
or yesterday god only knows what trump
administration has to gain
by completely blowing off all
responsibility to formulate a strategy
to contain the pandemic one would think
a responsible effort
would help his chances in november
instead
this utterly deranged
so let me break it down for you god only
knows what the trump administration has
to gain by completely blowing off
so this is a mind-reading thing where
he's trying to read their minds
that's not a thing so as soon as you're
into mind-reading mode you're you've
you've lost the the scent of of uh
of your argument all right
and exactly like there's a that they
haven't formulated a strategy
now i'm going to give you a lesson from
loser think on my whiteboard about how
to evaluate
trump's performance on the coronavirus
because i think most of us would agree
that if trump is seen as doing a good
job on the coronavirus by november
he will get reelected if he is seen as
doing a poor job
it's going to be harder so did trump do
a good job
or a bad job on chronovirus and how
would you decide that
let me teach you from my book loser
think
these are some of the things you would
learn there so i would say there are
five things you should look at you can
compare them to
the other president who is doing the
same job at the same time
oh wait there wasn't one oh so i guess
you can't compare him to the other
president
who was president of the united states
at the same time
who was making different decisions and
got a different outcome
because that person doesn't exist but
we imagine it does and that's sort of
the the seth macfarlane
um method he imagines a competent
president and what that would look like
and then he then he looks at trump and
he says man you're not nearly as good
as the imaginary one in my mind
that is loser think because the
imaginary one doesn't exist
and you don't know what that person
would do if they did exist
it is completely irrational to look at
one person doing one thing in one case
and saying well that's not as good as
the other imaginary person would do
now there will be some modifications to
that what i'll get to but
in general that's the starting point
number two you could compare the united
states performance to other countries
and if we were say in the top 20 percent
you'd say pretty good probably something
to do with leadership
not necessarily but probably if you're
in the top 20
but here's the problem all of our data
is bad
is is uh sweden doing really well or
we're really bad
get onto twitter spend five minutes
looking at sweden
related coronavirus arguments and data
and you will learn we don't know what's
going on there
we don't know what's going on in sweden
we don't know what's going on anywhere
really
all of our data is bad and
here's the bigger part it's not over yet
right because it would be easier to wait
to the end wouldn't it
if you waited to the end you could see
all right
we don't have to judge the the outcome
of the game at halftime
which wouldn't make sense right because
we're at half time now
so comparing to other countries at
halftime
that's kind of dicey but it would be
real
really good if you could compare him at
the end when
everybody's buried who's going to be
buried and you can count up the deaths
which ultimately would be the best for
the scorecard
but here's the thing we're not there yet
we're not there and what happens to all
the countries who are doing really well
right now
how about the countries that got their
in their infections and deaths down to
like
single digits what's going to happen to
them
in november it's coming back
the the thing that everybody misses in
this is that there's nothing that's
going to stop this virus
from infecting herd immunity everywhere
unless something gets invented that
hasn't yet been invented
if you think there's going to be a
vaccine well that's terrific
i don't i don't believe that a vaccine
is going to save us
i think that all of the other countries
are going to end up being kind of
comparable
because the virus can't be stopped and
even if you're taiwan
and you like drive it to zero which i
think they did at one point
as soon as you open your airports it's
coming back
because we didn't drive it to zero so as
long as the united states is not a zero
and other big countries are not a zero
and there's
global travel and everybody opens up
their economy because why wouldn't you
if your
infections are so low it's just going to
come back
so if you're looking at it today you're
looking at the game at halftime and
you're acting like you know how it ends
you don't
it would be completely irrational today
to compare any country to any other
country number one
all the data is bad all the data is bad
and not comparable
and you know what's what's up with the
vitamin d what's up with the uh
uh the uh vaccinations for tuberculosis
they have some kind of connection what's
up with hydroxychloroquine use
what's up with the age what's up with
you know do they count right do they
test right
do they do they measure the deaths
accurately
we don't have any of that as soon as you
think that we have
good data on this you are so far into
imaginary wonderland
that i don't know how to get you back
right so we can't compare them to the
president that doesn't exist we can't
compare him to other countries because
the date is bad and that would be
half time anyway we can't compare the
final outcome because that's months away
but we could look at his strategy and
see what he's actually doing
now the only way you could you could
judge his strategy to be
bad is if it was just so obviously bad
for example if his strategy to fight the
coronavirus
was to sacrifice a chicken and sing to
the moon
we wouldn't have to do any kind of a
study to find out that that was
bad strategy right it was just sort of
obvious
so is there anything that the president
has done or is doing
is just obviously wrong and could you
say that he doesn't have a strategy
as seth macfarlane says well i don't
like to use the word strategy because
there's no in some sense there's no no
such thing
that's another conversation but we do
have a
system and let me explain it
my understanding of the federal let's
say the federal government's response to
coronavirus
is number one let the states take the
lead in deciding
on a city-by-city basis what to do
that's our federal system does anybody
think
that's crazy is it crazy to let the
states
take the lead on the on the details
within the state no
that's our system it's exactly what
you'd expect the president to do
now the other thing you'd want them to
do is to backstop them so if they don't
have enough ppe
don't have enough ventilators well
that's something the federal government
could really do they can step
in with their emergency funding and
powers and
get that done did the president do that
yeah yeah he did that so we got the
ventilators we got the ppe
didn't run out hospitals didn't crash
so that worked out the other part of the
plan was
that we would stay flexible and we would
probably
experiment with reopening and then pull
back if we needed to
experiment pull back and then we would
also be trying you know try masks
try this try that and that we would be
picking away at it because nobody knew
the right answer
in a situation where nobody knows the
right answer
somebody guesses door a another leader
guesses door b
and let's say b turns out to be the
right one but they both guessed
there was no information to be had they
just guessed
is leader b the good one because they
guessed right
well you know history history will
record it that way
but uh no it's just a guess
so the system we used was to stay
flexible
try stuff pull back try stuff pull back
give the states as much authority as
possible share as much information as
possible
do the press conferences it looked
pretty good to me
i mean there's nothing about that that i
just described that is like
sacrificing a chicken and singing to the
moon so you could argue that it could
have been done better
right but you wouldn't have any
information there
you could say i think hypothetically if
something was done differently you'd get
a better result
but you can't know that and there's no
evidence of that
here's the uh last category the
president's tweets
his communication his pressers and
basically just the way he talks about it
i would say that's not been an a plus
and i don't think anybody would say that
i think you know he could have been
stronger on masks perhaps
but did it matter is there anybody not
wearing a mask
because the president maybe i don't know
but i feel like i feel like republicans
would have ended up there anyway
i don't think that if trump wore a mask
every day
do you think that that would cause the
voters to wear more masks
i don't know might just cause the
democrats to not wear masks
right because we see that whatever trump
does
half the country is going to do the
other thing or say it's wrong
so there's no evidence to suggest that
if trump had been stronger on his
messaging on masks
more people would wear masks just that
is not an evidence
because of his special case that people
would rather do the opposite of their
democrats
um what about his uh speculating of
you know hydroxychloroquine well that's
halftime too isn't it
is hydroxychloroquine the real thing if
it turns out
that by november we find out that
hydroxychloroquine works
trump is your president i don't know if
we'll do that
so i'm still at 50 percent chance that
the hydroxychloroquine when administered
early
and with the azithromycin then zinc
that's the important part
that i'd say 50 chance that there's
something real there
and 50 chance that
confirmation biases overcome us and that
there isn't anything there
um but will we know that by november
don't know um
and so i would say that communication
wise
he probably should have stayed away from
the medical stuff a little bit
but he did listen to the experts
he did listen to the experts i just
described a perfectly rational
approach we don't know if in the end
that's going to be better or worse
than other countries because it's only
half time and the you know the infection
rates and curves in different countries
were not aligned
so it's not like everybody started at
the same time and did the same things
so you should have some timing
differences it should be
expected the countries doing well
will eventually do less well and the
ones that are doing less well
will eventually do well and that you can
see you can see the curves crossing a
lot
between now and the end of the year all
right
let us talk about hydroxychloroquine
because we must yes we must
and i issued this challenge on twitter i
hope some of you saw it it goes like
this
and i feel like i should just run right
through this
have you ever seen a story about a guy
who got coveted
you know actually was infected got early
treatment with hydroxychloroquine
zinc and azithromycin all three
and then he died have you ever seen that
have you heard of one case anywhere in
the world
in which a person any person
anybody in the world got the coronavirus
and within a few days of getting it also
got the three drugs
and then later died because if you can
show me
one of those ideally
five five would be good then i would say
to myself well that's not a cure is it
you know it's still worth studying but
since
five people who took it in exactly the
right way
five of them died and we can confirm it
let's say
i would say well that moves to the
skeptical side
because remember the claims are that
it's nearly a miracle
the claim is that the word cure
in quotes because it's not technically a
cure but it's so close to a cure
that you can kind of say nobody's going
to die now let me ask you this
i know some of you were afraid that it
would be too easy to find such cases
but let me ask you this if democrats
could find any of those stories
wouldn't they be in the news already
don't you think that the democrats would
run
one profile a day in one of their pet
media vehicles don't you think the cnn
would have a story every other day
about the person who took exactly the
right amount at exactly the right time
and died anyway because that would be
the kill shot
there isn't a single chance that trump
could get elected
if five stories ran about five
real human beings who took exactly the
hydroxychloroquine thing
with the three drug combo and died
it would only take five real stories
to end the trump presidency how many
have you seen
zero so now i've tweeted it to half a
million people
now most of them are conservative so
they're not going to try to you know
accomplish the challenge i would imagine
but there will be enough democrats there
will be enough
operatives because a lot of people watch
my twitter enough people
you know a lot of congress apparently
watches my uh
my periscopes i've learned so there will
be enough people
on the left to see this challenge and
they will say to themselves
my god that's true that is true right
does anybody disagree
with this statement that if the media
ran
just five profiles of somebody who died
on the drug that
you know trump seems to like that would
be sort of the end of him
because the coronavirus is the big story
it's going to determine the election
so if you don't see any of those in the
next month
that might tell you something doesn't
tell you it works
because you could you know the the lack
of evidence is not proof of something
but it would certainly push me a lot
further into the
there might be something here category i
would raise my 50
estimate so this will just be fun to see
if anybody can
rise to the challenge and by the way um
i wouldn't say i would be just as happy
but i would be
i would feel like i had done a service
for the country
if those five people do appear because
don't you want to know
i mean it's kind of important you kind
of want to know if the hydroxyl
chloroclean works
i kind of want to know the answer so
even if the answer is not the one i want
i kind of want to know the answer even
if it changes the election
because it's that important all right um
andy noe tweeted this little fact
if you're not following him uh to watch
all the protest
action and video you're missing a lot so
is andy no
ngo and he tweeted that according to
law enforcement source there have been
22 homicides in portland
since june 1st so that's seven weeks
22 murders in all of last year there
were only 36.
so we got 22 murders in seven weeks
compared to a full year which would
typically be 36.
and then he said that the mayor ted
wheeler dismantled the gun violence
reduction team
because he and others said it was unfair
to blacks
now are you seeing a pattern here
i'm seeing in your comments people
saying that herman cain died
so i don't know about that story but
we'll look into it later but people are
saying it in the comments so you don't
have to say it again
i just said that so you don't have to um
so here's the pattern it looks like
uh if this rate continued of this number
of homicides you'd have some
[Music]
you know if if you assume that there's
some breakdown of how many black people
are getting killed
by murder and white people etc if it's
typical of a big city
hundreds of black people will be
murdered
because the mayor dismantled the gun
violence reduction team
because it was unfair to the black
people
hundreds of which would be murdered by
this change
now i'm pro-gun all right i'm pro-second
amendment
so i don't have
i guess i don't have a philosophical
problem with
not taking guns away from people
but i'm just not sure that
the black citizens of this country are
getting
are really getting uh any favors from
the white people in this country who are
literally trying to help them and doing
all the wrong things
now this this story reminded me you know
so ted wheeler is a white guy
trying to help the black community
probably means it probably means well
you know i have no reason to think he
means anything you know
bad so he he thinks he's doing a good
thing and it probably ended up in the
murder of
hundreds murder murder of hundreds of
his citizens that didn't need to get
murdered
but he protected the feelings of some
people and i guess that's good too
but this reminds me of is it my
imagination or have
white women completely ruined the black
lives
black lives matter movement is that
is that just my imagination because i
keep seeing more videos
of uh actual real black people
yelling at white people who are trying
to help them
but they're not helping them at all you
know like the the
the white girls who are graffitiing
black lives matter
on a business and and the black citizens
are back there saying
don't do that that's just going to look
bad for us
you're not even black why are you
writing black lives matter on a building
they're going to assume it's us in the
right
so just over and over again uh and
if you're watching the arrests correct
me if i'm wrong it's all white people
getting arrested
right whenever you see these arrest
things i guess there have been some some
black people arrested but it feels like
it's mostly white people
and it's just making the whole black
lives movement
it's just ruining it it's completely
ruining it and
when you see black people complain that
anything that they do that's good
gets ruined by white people the first
time you hear that you say well that's
that's not true it's not true that
everything good that black people do
some white person is going to come steal
it or ruin it that's not true
and then you look at all the examples
and you go
it's a little bit true it's not maybe
100 true but it's
it's trueish it's got some truth to it
trump had a couple of interesting
executive orders which is one of his
advantages he has because he's an office
so he can actually do stuff
whereas biden can talk about stuff but
trump could do stuff and he did two
interesting things uh one of them he
said he was happy to inform all the
people living in their suburban
lifestyle dream
which is just a great phrase coming from
the president
that you will no longer be bothered or
financially hurt by having low income
housing
built in your neighborhood so he signed
an executive order
overturning some obama rule that
required low-income housing in the
suburbs
now here's the important part of that
would this have been possible before the
protests
do you think that trump could have
gotten away i don't know if he'll get
away with it yet but
he's trying do you think he'll get away
with an executive order
banning low-income housing in the in the
suburbs
today and the answer is yes
the answer is yes you can get away with
it
but could he have gotten away with it a
year ago
here's why i don't think he could a year
ago if you had seen that the president
wanted to um strike down low-income
housing
requirements what would you think of
that a year ago you would have said
well no that you know why can't we help
the low-income people
you know everybody's got to live in the
town i mean the town isn't going to be
all prosperous people
right if the town has restaurants you
need restaurant workers they have to
live somewhere
you've got senior citizens so of course
you want some low income housing
around your suburban area it's just fair
and it kind of makes sense
right so that's what you would have
thought a year ago and you would have
said well that sounds a little racist
sounds a little bit racist because
you're saying low-income housing but
maybe you're thinking people of color
is that what you're thinking right so
that's what it would look like a year
ago
what's it look like today today it looks
like the best idea you ever heard
because the protests are making it
seem and again it's how you feel it's
it's what you think is true it's not
what's true that matters it's just what
you think is true
and when you watch the protest what you
think is
i need to get as far away from that
group of people as i can
young people without much money let's
just call it that
youngish people without much money
because they look dangerous
they're protesting they're lighting
stuff on fire they got
purple hair my god purple hair
i like purple hair but somebody's going
to say something like that
so trump is so good at picking up free
money that's i always say that about him
and because of the protests this
low-income housing executive order
became free money it was like a pile of
money
just sitting on the table and all he had
to do is walk by and say
is this money does this belong to
anybody
no all right it's my money and just pick
it up and he did
i think this was in terms of timing this
was the best timing you've ever seen for
an executive order
i mean i mean i just laughed when i saw
it's like oh my god that's just perfect
independent of what you think about the
idea the politics of it
is perfect then after this
the ceos of the tech companies did their
uh
their hearing he does another executive
order
directed to the fcc to implement uh
preventing online censorship
to limit section 230. so i don't know
the details of that yet i'm not sure
there are details
but the president just said how about i
use my executive order
and just tell them they have to you know
stop uh discriminating who exactly can
argue against that
is there anybody on the other side of
that is he going to force the democrats
to say
no we don't want freedom of speech
there's nothing you can do about it now
i don't know if this executive order
will have any impact
but it does put pressure on the tech
companies
and a lot of trump's base had been
screaming for months
that he wasn't doing enough to protect
the base you know their their voices and
keep them on the platforms etc and i
don't know if this is enough
but it's a lot right an executive order
from the president
to prevent online censorship that's a
lot
right i don't know how it'll play out
but it doesn't it's not nothing
it's a lot all right
um when you're trying to figure out who
the liars are in this world
it seems like it's getting easier and
easier now nbc
news used to be something like a news
business
but now i think everybody agrees
it's something else i don't know what it
is it's either
a cia front
i don't know but it's whatever it is
that they don't seem to try too hard
to get the news right it looks they're
more like the national
enquirer of news at this point so nbc's
andrea mitchell was interviewing dr
fauci
and of course asked about
hydroxychloroquine
and fauci gave this answer which is that
all of the gold standard clinical trials
the only ones that really can tell you
if something works or not
have shown it has no effect
and it might even be harmful now is that
a lie
no no that's completely 100 true
the only you know high end
you know with uh controls and you know
placebo and all that the only high-end
studies
did show that it didn't work but
what did andrea mitchell and nbc and dr
fauci
leave out because there's a lie by
omission here
here's what's left out the trials that
didn't work
were when they tested the wrong thing
they tested
hospitalized patients who were near
death
who already had these psychotone you
know storm or whatever it is their
immune system had grown wild
which is not what the hydroxychloroquine
is supposed to work on
because the the infection has two phases
when the infection grows and then the
dangerous part is if it causes your
immune system to go crazy
nobody thinks that the
hydroxychloroquine is for that second
part
but that's what they studied so if the
only thing you studied
was the wrong thing should you go on tv
and say the studies show it doesn't work
for the thing that didn't get studied
because when they study the other stuff
these are not as high quality studies so
even though there are a lot of them
you don't have to you don't have to
tweet me yet another
study about hydroxychloroquine working
if you get it early
i've seen them there are a lot of them
but they all have the same quality
they're not a gold standard you know
double blind sort of test so
doesn't matter how many there are they
don't add up to credibility
right there could be hundreds of them
they still wouldn't mean anything
because that's why you have the gold
standard study
the whole point of the gold standard
kind of study clinical trial is that all
of the other things
don't work if they did
then that's all you need to do you never
have to do the other kind
now is it true that the more studies you
have
that look at it from different angles
even if they're not 100
you know quality studies if you have
lots and lots of them does that
eventually
tell you that you know you should use it
here's my take
then it becomes a risk management
decision
then you say to yourself well there's a
good chance it could work
and there's almost no chance it'll hurt
you so
it doesn't cost much won't hurt you
might work let's try it so you'd end up
in the same place
of trying it without without that
certainty
so here's my point i don't believe
there's any way that dr fauci
doesn't know what i just said right you
you'd agree that
he knows everything i know and lots more
so there should be nothing i know that's
this basic
that he doesn't already know and he
knows that when he says it's been tested
and didn't work he knows he's talking
about the wrong thing
right in the beginning you could say
well you know he chose to focus on this
or you know he likes to talk about the
the high quality trials but he uses
those as an example of how the
completely
other thing won't work and that has
not been tested in those same kind of
trials and when they do test
it looks like it works in the in the
lesser trials
so um i would say that yesterday when i
saw this was my departure point
for dr fauci so i like to give everybody
maximum benefit of a doubt i don't like
to do the mind reading where you say
well i think you're lying or
i think you have a you know some
interest or something i'd rather give
everybody the benefit of a doubt because
usually that's right
but i can't anymore
i can't anymore this is just so
obviously a lie
and it's really important one this this
isn't some
this isn't some small thing this is
important
and he lied about it and nbc did too so
don't trust them
um
here's uh interesting thing uh i tweeted
just before i got on i want to see how
many retweets i got in that
that the root of all of our problems and
i'm going to say this as many times
in as many days as it takes until it
becomes a thing
that the root of all of our current
national problems are the teachers
unions
now if that isn't immediately obvious to
you
let me give you some examples 1500
retweets so people are agreeing
so this was my tweet i said most of our
national problems and then i list them
unemployment poverty systemic racism the
school's close the uptick in suicide
the crime drugs and even trump
derangement syndrome
are all caused by the teachers unions
because the teachers unions
restrict competition for schools so they
they're the force that stops you from
having more charter schools and more
private schools and all that and because
they restrict
school choice that means less
competition
and it means that people get bad
educations
and if you live in a poorer part of town
you're definitely going to get a bad
education
so does giving poor people a bad
education
does that increase unemployment yes
yes it does does giving poor people a
bad education
increase poverty yes yes it does
does giving poor people a bad education
increase
systemic racism in a sense
here's the way i like to say it systemic
racism
exists but it's not going away
it gets sort of just baked into
everything and everybody is just sort of
it's like the air but if you have a good
education
and a good job does racism bother you as
much
it's still there still bothers you but
it's not stopping your life from
succeeding right
so if the teachers unions could allow
poor kids
and black kids in this in this context
the black kids
to get well actually any person of color
i suppose
to get a better education there would
still be systemic racism but you
wouldn't notice it as much
it just wouldn't be a reason to complain
about it it's like yeah
people are jerks that's it people are
jerks i got a good job
that's it how about closed
schools that's totally the teachers
unions and
all the problems that the closed schools
cause including an uptick in suicide
teen suicide going through the roof
teachers union
crime drugs all of those are caused by
poverty
bad education so basically we have
essentially one problem in this country
the teachers unions if you could if you
could thwart them
fix them get them out of the picture or
whatever and fix
education for kids all of those other
problems
start to get solved you know within a
generation
if you focus on the exact wrong thing
such as the death of george floyd as
tragic as it was
if you focus on the entirely wrong thing
literally the smallest problem in the
black community
feels like the biggest one maybe but
it's definitely the smallest one
because if you fix the george floyd
problem let's say
let's say the police officers get found
guilty and go to jail
i guess you're you fixed your structural
racism right no wouldn't fix anything it
would be the smallest
thing if you're talking about the entire
your community of
you know the country the black community
in particular it would be the smallest
thing
but what if you fixed education what if
every black kid was just guaranteed
if they wanted one to have a good
education even if they didn't have
two parents even if they weren't rich no
matter where they lived
they'd definitely get a good education
what's that fix
that fixes everything basically
so um teachers unions
are the devils i might be saying that a
little more
uh the ap reports that there's a russian
disinformation
campaign going on and that they're
spreading stories on their websites
that are conspiracy type theories to
you know mess things up in the united
states
but here's the thing i read some of the
examples i've never heard them before
so apparently there are these
russian-made conspiracy theories
on these obscure websites none of these
got into any you know
name brand website they're like no
traffic websites
with these ridiculous conspiracy
theories that i've never even heard of
and they look ridiculous on the surface
i didn't even
remember them they're so so nothing and
i realized that the russian
disinformation
can't pierce all of our
domestic disinformation there is so much
disinformation from our own media
that you need a lot of russian
disinformation even to get noticed
because you know you when you think
about disinformation from a
from a foreign adversary you your
imagination goes to all right there's
all our good information
there's this big body of clean credible
good
information and then damn those russians
they're putting this this little bit of
wrong information
into our good clean information it's
ruining everything
except nothing like that's happening
what's happening is you've got a giant
turd
and russia is flying over and pooping on
it like a bird
so you've added a little bit of bird
turd
to an eight-foot pile of manure
i guess that's foreign interference but
that bird turd is not going to penetrate
eight feet of disinformation from our
own media
i mean it's just good luck russia
russia if you could come up with better
disinformation than cnn and msnbc
go ahead knock yourself out all right
here's an interesting factoid to throw
in the mix
so uh dr james todaro he's one of the
front line doctors who was a pro
hydroxychloroquine
uh but he's i find him to be the most
credible of the bunch and especially
he's the most credible on the um
on the topic of hydroxychloroquine being
suppressed
right so there's two questions one is
does it work
which he thinks it does and then the
other question is is somebody trying to
suppress it
i would say his argument that it's being
suppressed is really strong
his argument that it works yeah i could
be convinced but i'm not quite there yet
so here's what he tweeted today he said
after four months of appeals since it
was taken down
google finally uncensored our initial
paper on hydroxicolar queen
in treatment of kovid19 and then he said
it's strange google reversed this
decision immediately before appearing
in front of congress today to discuss
censorship
so google uncensored their paper that
they've been trying to get uncensored
forever
the day that they were called in front
of congress to answer for their
censorship
maybe a coincidence maybe not
all right here's the worst story of the
day i'll land on this
so uh you remember mike schellenberger
who wrote apocalypse never i had him on
here and he's an expert
on environmental stuff so congress
asked him to come in for a hearing so
that they could
you know learn what he had to say
compare it to everything else they knew
and make better decisions
sounds pretty good right congress
invites an expert in
expert gives them some information maybe
they agree with it maybe they don't
talk to some other experts that's all
good stuff
right well what happens is
they gave him the the bill bar treatment
the democrats
basically just used their time to malign
his character
and just leave it there all they did was
just trash him
the democrats anyway so imagine being
invited to congress and here's the
the key part of this he's not an elected
representative
you know he's not the ceo of a tech
company that's effectively running the
world
he's not the ceo of a tobacco company
he's a guy who's trying to help the
earth he's trying to help
the earth like that's his job you know
like he lives and breathes and has been
doing it for i guess most of his
or all of his adult life learning
everything he can about you know green
technology every bit of
conservation everything and he's just
going in to tell him
to tell them what he knows and they
trashed him
the democrats um that is
so wrong i don't even know how to
express it
because it's one thing to trash you know
the
you know a politician or somebody who's
in the ring and you've got a
a rivalry but when you ask a citizen
a private citizen who just happens to be
an expert on something
you ask him in and then you use the
power of congress
to ruin his reputation or try to
or try to and squash him like a bug
 you sorry didn't mean to swear
slip down but um
that was the most grotesque thing i
think i've seen
from any government because that's just
that just crosses the line
right you know you can do anything to
the professionals
and you know obviously michael
schoenberg's a professional
but he's a private citizen like we
didn't elect him
yet we might elect him someday
but haven't elected him yet that was
just inappropriate
all right um we'll go check on herman
cain
i guess there's some story there um
did you enjoy today's periscope i told
you it would be the best one ever
i think it was what do you say
um the left is being surprised by the
right's tenacity somebody says
are they thoughts on election day do you
mean the day itself or
the result
um on the day itself i don't know that's
all up in the air
it's hard it's hard to know now did you
see the uh
there was a some local local news
program i think it was they did a test
of mail-in ballots
and i think the test was just to mail a
bunch of ballots and just see if they
arrived
and something like three out of 100
didn't arrive
and i thought to myself uh three out of
100 is too much
if if 3 out of 100 just got lost in the
mail
that's a problem it's a pretty big
problem because our elections
are decided by less than three percent
oh you agree it was the the best ever
and happy birthday to
mausman uh or mossman
wassman uh
thank you thank you yeah i don't take
days off
i don't like sleep so i've been up 24
hours and i'm not even a little bit
tired i don't know what's up with this
but i will talk to you tomorrow
