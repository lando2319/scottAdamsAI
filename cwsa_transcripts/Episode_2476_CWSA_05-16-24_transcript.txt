well locals people are here YouTube in

you I want to make sure everybody's here
before we get
started Rumble anybody come on there we
go Rumble in the house yeah
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the best time of
your life if you'd like to take it up to
levels that you w won't even really be
able to explain to your
grandkids all you need for that is a
cuper mug glass of Tanger chel Stein the
canteen joer flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
happens right now
go ah I see we have a visitor from
Canada watching today a visitor from
Canada congratulations I don't know how
you escaped don't go back don't go
back all right well we got news today um
theme of the show today will be that
we've entered the serious gaslighting
phase
serious gaslighting phase oh not just
the ordinary gaslighting we're getting
into the serious gaslighting phase why
is this doing
[Music]
that weird all
right um you know America gets uh kind
of a lot of criticisms for things we do
internationally but there is one thing
we
do that that's that's it's going to
drive me crazy why that looks like that
on the
[Music]
side why is this happening today but has
never happened
before what would be causing that to
happen
oh
huh
well can't really figure that out
there's some weird lighting effect that
has never happened before
or uh it's really driving me crazy
though there we go all right well that's
better all right we're in good shape
now so I was saying that America gets a
you know bad reputation for some of the
things we do but uh here's a report that
this should change how you feel about
Americans yeah if you happen to be
American and I'm not talking to you
Canadians but if you happen to be
American this should make you a little
bit proud this is a report from unusual
Wales on X and uh unusual Wales tells us
that company called Novo Nordisk the
maker of OIC and wovi is now Europe's
Most Valuable company according to
Bloomberg all right all right the the
company that makes that fat loss thing
OIC the the biggest most valuable
company in
Europe good job now that is how America
makes Europe great we are going to keep
eating until Europe is the best richest
place in the world now do we get credit
for that no everybody just says oh you
Americans you're just fat and loud and
poorly dressed and you keep attacking
countries for no reason except to make
money and I say well that may be true
but have you considered how rich we're
making a European company
have you I think that's got to be
factored into our good
works yeah if there's anybody else who
would like me to eat until you're richer
I'll do
it I'll sacrifice for you I'll get as
fat as I need to be until you're
rich well Jamie Diamond our uh most
famous Banker in America thinks we
should be uh doing dealing with our debt
issue because if we don't it will be be
far more uncomfortable in the
future far more
uncomfortable are there other things
that are fatal to all of civilization
that we speak of in such soft
terms well the debt will probably
destroy the United States and cause a a
ripple domino effect that will destroy
really all life and civilization forever
before we get to the to Mars and have a
chance of
survival um but the way Jamie Diamond
phrases that is uh it could be far more
uncomfortable in the future
possibly now here's the question that
scares the out ofy I don't know
about
you but in my opinion it seems obvious
that our debt problem is the biggest
problem would we all agree with that
there there's nothing on the the same
level as that right we don't really have
a risk of a nuclear war not
really we're not really going to burn up
from climate change anytime soon you
know maybe it'll just make the plants
grow better I don't know uh but our debt
situation is quite
literally you know no joke the end of
civilization because when the economy
breaks it's not going to fix itself it's
just going to be broken what are you
going to do you have to start over so
when I see here's the thing that scares
me there's no serious person who's
suggesting a way to fix it now I've
never seen that
before every other problem has somebody
whose job it is you know somebody gets
Rich usually as suggesting a way to fix
it like oh you can fix climate change if
you just build lots of solar panels and
window Mills now you could argue whether
that would work or not work but you
can't argue that somebody is suggesting
It's Your
solution and you could go write down
every other problem it's like what's
what's the solution to Ukraine well some
people would say fight harder some
people would say pull out but those
would be actual
recommendations those would be
suggestions but you do realize that
there's nobody serious who is even put
forth an idea for solving the debt
problem nothing not not Trump not Biden
not their advisors not the pundits not
the bankers not not Larry Fink you know
not Black
Rock why is
that the and I hate to tell you but the
only reason I could think that nobody is
suggesting a
solution is because there isn't one
I don't know if a solution would even
look like anything but stupid so when I
mentioned it and a number of people said
okay how about this how about that but
the things they suggested they don't
realize that we're so far beyond where
those things would make a
difference for example I saw a good
suggestion uh just moments before I get
on here that if you're going to give
money to other countries you should at
least ask them to pay back
the interest for the money that we
borrowed now I say to myself
oh that's not a bad idea except we're
only giving money to people who don't
have money so I don't know how that work
but suppose they did suppose they
started paying us interest on some some
monies that we uh gave to other
countries that would be like
0.001% of our
debt it would make any difference well
what if some other people said oh we
should C spending
10% it wouldn't make any
difference that that doesn't get you
anywhere near
survival it would make a difference to
the number but it wouldn't help you
you'd still be dead so there actually
isn't any
solution that any serious person has
ever
suggested how do I I don't have any
other way to interpret that other than
we're just going to write it to the end
and it's going to come pretty soon how
else do you interpret it I mean I I hate
to be all doom and gloom but I don't see
any other way to see it do you tell tell
me your reason I should be
optimistic I can't think of
one and worse I think that Trump will
come in to what looks like an impossible
to solve problem it might have to get a
lot worse before anything can get
better now here's what I think could
save us uh I just saw a bill p uh post
replying to one of mine and he asked me
if the Adam's law of slow moving
disasters
applies and the answer is it
should but normally by now you'd at
least see some hints of what that
solution would look like I'm not seeing
any I haven't seen anything that's even
a whiff of a suggestion of a
hint that anybody has any idea what to
do so the only thing I can think of is
that we're on the cusp of a enormous
economic
upheaval where all the rules will change
you know we're one year from every have
from people like me having a robot in
the
house like an actual robot in one year
if I'm still doing this there will be a
robot standing behind
me don't you know that's true right
there will be an actual robot living in
my house in one year now what's that
going to do to the economy I don't know
nobody knows but the stimulating effect
will be like something we've never seen
before so it could
be that there's some clever way we
introduce some digital currency that you
hate and something about new Industries
and something about getting people to
live cheaper in my opinion the only way
this can be solved is by building cities
from scratch
and they would be specialized cities you
ready for this idea biggest idea you
have ever heard of what are you going to
do with all the
homeless you cannot put them in the city
with everybody else and just say hey how
about you live in the sidewalk nope how
about you build an
agrarian um City I'll call it a you know
it's rural so it's not a city a an
agrarian town and you say everybody who
works who lives here will get a cheap
place to live because we'll build it
cheap but you have to work in the
fields so you have to actually do some
farming that way it's a job that
everybody can do did you ever do you
ever wonder why it was that we didn't
have so much homeless in the past
because we must have had mental health
and we certainly had lots of
Alcoholics I don't know the answer to
that but I think the answer is that they
could get jobs in the past I think you
could be you know total alcoholic and if
you showed up to pick the cotton or to
lift the bricks or to carry the ice
somewhere that's all you need you could
just sort of show up and have muscles
and you could do your job so I think we
would need to build entire
communities where the people who can't
do anything except maybe show up
sometimes and carry some stuff can have
a
job so I don't think that you can mix
the people who are living on the streets
you know with Jamie Diamond and Larry
fank and me it just doesn't work but you
could one could imagine build a
community that was self- sustaining paid
for itself had almost no energy costs
and you could cycle people in who are in
a bad situation and they'd have a place
to live cheaply and with a you know
dignity and stuff so I don't believe we
should try to
incorporate the homeless the drug addict
the mentally incapable with the rest of
every other people it just can't work
you got to build them their whole new
community that's just for people like
them we we probably need communities
that just for addicts where you can't
get any drugs in but it's a nice town
just impossible to get anything into
it and I think that we need to build
towns from scratch where the ordinary
cost of living for a young person would
be almost nothing imagine if you will
that you're a 20-some and you're looking
at the impossibility of buying a house
but I say to you hey Trump's building a
new city and he's going to try to
attract a lot of young people so let's
say that's a theme uh young uh baby
making age people and if you go there
there'll be tons of people who are
single and about your age and all of
them are in similar situations and
you'll build this community together and
uh you'll be able to afford to live
there because the homes will be so cheap
and the energy will be free and you
won't need a car and Wi-Fi will be
everywhere so you could build you could
build ,000 a month lives that would be
high
quality so that's my suggestion is
building cities from scratch except each
City should be built around a theme it
might be one for retirees one for drug
addicts one for people who can't do any
kind of work
but carry stuff and other for people who
want to build a let's say a high-tech
life and have some kids and I think
that's the way we're going to get out of
this uh there's some pressure on black
rocks Larry Fink to not get paid because
of his screwing the pooch with ESG now I
doubt that'll succeed but imagine your
Larry think and there's a very large
movement that you should not get paid a
penny
you shouldn't get paid at
all now and apparently the movement to
not pay is pretty big but is that the
only thing happening with ESG no it's
not it turns out there's an article
opinion article in the Wall Street
Journal and I didn't know about this but
this is hilarious all right if you're
following ESG the uh Equity social
governance whatever it is trying to be
good people
ESG people like black rock created lists
of companies who were bad at ESG so that
they can be damned and
criticized and do you know what the
counter the counter to that is this is
so
cool there's actually a list now of ESG
idiot
companies ESG idiots people who are
implementing ESG and they get a grade
and the more the more ESG they've
implemented the worse their
grade so you know you can only get a you
can only get a good grade By ignoring as
much ESG as possible and so it's it's an
idiot list they actually made an idiot
list for a company's doing
ESG
perfect now you worry about the uh
slippery
slope people always criticize me because
I say the slippery slope isn't real but
I think people misinterpret what I mean
by that when I say it's not real of
course I'm not saying that some things
don't keep going in One Direction and
you wish they hadn't because we observe
that that's obviously true what I'm
saying is that if you say it's a
slippery slope you've described the
problem in a way that there's no
solution and I don't like that so I say
don't do that instead say everything
goes in the direction is going
everything everything good everything
bad until something stops
it so it's the until something stops it
that is the part that gives you
something you can do oh well maybe we
should do something to stop it that's
the way you should think about it and
talk about it so when I see that the ESG
was becoming this huge toxic thing I
didn't say to myself well it looks like
it's ESG forever and it'll just get
worse until we're all dead no I said
there will be some counter force that
will pop up and here it is now there's
the the list against the list there's an
ESG uh hero list and an ESG idiot list
and it's the same companies on
both I love that there's a hero list and
an idiot list it's the same list here's
the ones doing the most ESG yeah that's
our list except we call them idiots
because they're screwing their
shareholders anyway so there reports
that the uh Zeal for ESG is falling off
well last night I watched the Flynn
documentary how many of you have seen it
General Flynn it's his story about the
government targeting him in the Trump
era uh letby recommended it
highly I recommend it highly um a lot of
it is you know character stuff about his
family and you know just how bad things
were when he was being abused by our
government but I feel like that was
necessary
um it was important to you for you to
see that there was a real human being at
the bottom of this
Badness and I I'll give you the summary
I don't want to ruin it for
you but it's way better than I thought
and when I say way better I don't mean
just that it was well produced which it
was
um but it just makes your brain
go
really did this really happen in America
I'll just give you the the quick version
of it it would appear now keep in mind
uh you know somebody's going to say this
before I say it but it's a
documentary you do know that I say often
the what I call the documentary effect
means that when you're done you will be
completely convinced that the
documentary told you the truth and
there's nothing left to
know but if there were another
documentary it might change your mind
because all documentary are persuasive
so was this documentary persuasive yes
it was wow super super
persuasive could somebody have a
counterargument some other context that
I'm not aware of yes they
could but like all documentaries if
you've only seen one I really can't
imagine it like literally my brain can't
imagine what the counterargument would
be but of course that's the Trap
the Trap is that you can't you can never
imagine what the counter argument would
be if you haven't heard it so as far as
I know and I've never seen it in any
other context there is no counter
argument as far as I know this is the
documentary tells you exactly what
happened I I've never seen anything that
would refute it but let me let me give
you the big picture so the big picture
is that General Flynn was considered the
most respected expert in the a military
intelligence
field and Trump uh and he worked well
with Trump and uh here's the part you
didn't know tell me if you knew this
Flynn's a Democrat and has always been
one did you know that did you know that
Flynn was a
Democrat and always was his whole fames
Democrats always have been describ
themselves as Kennedy Democrats
now you might ask yourself why was he
willing to work with Trump isn't that
weird well it turns out they had one
common
interest bet you didn't know
this the common interest was according
to Flynn this is his view of the world
for the last 59 years the United States
has been creating unnecessary Wars for
profit and he wanted to stop it and he
would have had the power to do it he
would have known where all the bodies
were hidden so to speak you know how
everything works and Trump had appointed
him to what would have been the head of
all of it he would have been the head of
all the Intel
everything and in his opinion the
military-industrial complex is the only
reason we're having war after war after
war and that he saw it firsth hand in
Afghanistan for example and he wasn't
going to put up with it and he was just
going to gut it he was going to gut the
military-industrial complex with
Trump
why because he's not just a Democrat it
turns out he's a patriot and as a
patriot and as someone who swore
allegiance to the
country he realized the only way he
could live out that Duty was to
coordinate with Trump because Trump had
a similar interest in taking down the
swamp but what happened
instead the swamp took him out it's
exactly what you think he was taken out
with trumped up charges by the worst
people in the government and every bit
of it was just to get rid of him so he
couldn't gut the government's illegal
criminal activities that they've been
doing for 59
years it's exactly what you thought it
was and worse
I didn't realize that he was going to
dismantle the people who dismantled him
I didn't realize it was that direct I I
always thought it was like well you know
people don't like anybody who's working
with Trump I thought it was more of a
generic if they can get to any Trump
people they would it had nothing to do
with what he was going to do per se it
was just he's a trump guy we're g to go
after all the Trump
guys it's all the same it's just this
it's just the military-industrial
complex intelligence people uh Gathering
up to stop Trump and to stop him because
Trump and um yeah so Trump and
Flynn were uncorruptible
that was the problem they were
uncorruptible
now I'm not going to say that you know
they're they're the holiest people and
you know they're on the side of the
Angels I'm just going to say that Flynn
does seem to be apparently a pure
Patriot like every indication is just
that Trump simply didn't have an
interest you know any monetary interest
in being part of the military industrial
complex so for him what would be a good
job for Trump which would be a good job
for the country would be to shave that
down a little bit and that's why they
came for him so once you see the
the uh the evil that came after Flynn
and you see the characters involved it's
the same people who went after Trump and
it had nothing to do with what Trump did
or what Flynn did in terms of illegal
Behavior it wasn't they it it was
entirely to keep the prophet pump
working it's exactly what you thought it
was so I highly recommend it uh not only
because it's really eye openening but
and and by the way you do know that the
bad people threatened to put his son in
jail over probably nothing and that he
plad guilty just to keep his son out of
jail and there really wasn't any other
choice I mean he was screwed harder than
I've see any any American ever
screwed I mean you
know Peter Navaro is still in
prison that elections
coming Peter Navaro is still in prison a
political prisoner we all know that it's
just political prisoner an election's
coming act
appropriately all
right uh Marjorie Taylor green is saying
that you know she's speaking out again
as she has often times about the fenel
deaths so between 2019 and 2020 2 the
the Georgia fenal deaths because that's
your state um have increased over
350% so from the time I started
complaining about it in 2018 when my
stepson died from an
overdose from that time all the
complaining I've done and all the things
people have
said it's up
350% how many people is that it's a 300
Americans every day are
killed 300 Americans every
day now do you remember there were some
reports that say that Trump was
considering SP sending Special Forces
into take out the
cartels and you know my opinion is that
it seems quite obvious to me at this
point that the cartels are working with
the same bad people who got rid of Flynn
and are trying to get rid of trump is
that fair
because they do seem to have the power
and if they want to stop it they have
the ability the only way you can
interpret our current situation is that
the baddest people are working with the
cartels either to share money or because
they have some common interest in
controlling the countries south of our
border now we've been told that it's
probably I think the Mike Ben's opinion
is that has more to do with controlling
the other governments because the
cartels are so powerful
everywhere that have partnering with the
governments would be a little bit
helpful but it would be way more helpful
if we partner with the people really in
power the
cartels now how do you explain that if
we're working productively the American
uh comp country with the cartels how
does that make sense with the fact that
we heard a story that Trump might want
to go in militarily against the cartels
the only way that makes
sense is exactly what it looks like the
people in power are not telling Trump
what the real situation
is and I believe he does not know that
the cartels are our people because the
deepest part of the deep state knows and
they're not going to tell him and I
think that's the only reason he would
suggest military action is he doesn't
know that this has all been it's all
fixed that they're not really our
enemies in the sense that the darkest
part of our country is working with them
it's they're basically us it's coming
from inside the house how else would you
explain it how else would you explain
that no one else has ever talked well
let me put it in another more
historically
everybody who might have ever been uh
let's say briefed on the real
situation does not suggest military
action
the one person we know from lots of
reports the the intelligence people have
said directly there are things we're not
going to tell Trump how do you explain
that the only person that we know hasn't
been briefed on the situation is the
only one in favor of military action
there's only one way to explain that
he's the only one who doesn't know the
truth and the people who know the truth
have told us Direct ly we don't think we
can tell him the truth they've said that
in public I'm not
speculating they say it right out loud
we don't think we can tell Trump the
real truth so I think that's the whole
story I think Trump is not aware that
they're on our team I mean in the worst
possible way they're on our
team now would I think that if I had not
seen the Flynn documentary well I'll
tell you after you see see the Flynn
documentary everything's on the table
because if you see what they're doing to
Trump right in front of your
face the
laware and then you see the uh the Flynn
documentary and because it was Flynn not
Trump he didn't get nearly as much light
on his
situation it's the same situation it's
the same people and the same
situation and if these are happening
right in front of us you have to ask
yourself what else could they do we're
pretty sure the same people or the the
legacy of these same people killed
Kennedy don't we I mean a lot of us
think that I think that's the likely
scenario that they were at least in on
it might have been other interests like
the mafia but I think uh I think our
people were in on it so if you think
that's true what are the odds that the
elections are not riged
I mean seriously what are the what are
the odds that our elections are fair
given what we saw with Flynn given what
we're watching right now with
Trump given what we think happened to
Kennedy given what might have happened
to
Nixon given that there's a suspicious
number of CIA people in the Atlantic
Council that uses Soros as a
bank I think every bit of this is
real there was a time I wouldn't have
believed any of it but the things you
can observe and are you know clearly
verifiably
true suggests that the the zone of
Badness is way bigger than you could
have imagined and that it's all possible
I'm not saying it's all true every
allegation of Badness but it's all
possible none of it can be ruled out for
well that's too wild I saw in the
comments somebody saying what about the
moon hoax I don't know I think the moon
landing was real but if you told me it's
impossible that they oaed it I would say
no it's
possible if you need me to say it's
possible oh yeah oh yeah it's possible I
would bet against it I would bet it was
real but is it possible absolutely
totally possible and I wouldn't have
said that a while ago
well uh last week this rasmason is
telling us this raspon polling company
that Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed
a new law that requires all absy belts
to be counted within an hour of the
polls closing on Election Day that isn't
that a good idea because you're supposed
to have all the ballots in on Election
Day or they shouldn't be counted if it's
after election day and and the longer
you wait you know the longer some
suspicious thing might happen so that's
that's a rule that we could all agree on
right who in who in the world would be
against
that I mean nobody could be against that
well so obviously a good idea right so
pretty much 100% of people will be in
favor of that I would
think so let's see if you can guess what
percentage are opposed to it anybody
want to take a guess what percentage of
the people pulled or
opposed to counting all the votes on
Election
Day what do you think that would
be if you
guessed
26% you would be
correct there is no question dumb enough
that you won't get 25% of the people
roughly to get the wrong answer that's
right a quarter of the people ped
thought that you should be able to count
the vote after election
day how is that even a
question how are we even asking the
question it's election day it's not
election week it's not election month
it's election day because we want it to
be one day because it works better if
it's one day if you drag it out it's
only for there isn't another
reason to drag it out
there's no
justification for not doing
this but you can always get that solid
one quarter of the public to be in favor
of
anything well do you remember that uh
the her report where
uh where her hu RR said
uh that Biden was a dementia riddled not
not his exact words but he was a
quivering pile of mental destruction and
debris and there was nothing left he
didn't use any of those words I'm
putting words in his mouth but he said
that Biden was an old feeble man
essentially and of course the Dem the
Republicans said well wouldn't it be
nice to have a recording of that just
find out how bad it was imagine how bad
it was that her thought it was necessary
to tell
us just think about
that in the context you know of a legal
situation is it ever necessary to tell
you that oh by the way this person seems
to be mentally
incompetent it's usually not important
right if you're just looking at the
details of some criminal
allegation but he thought that was
important enough that we needed to know
so how bad is it well it's bad enough
that Biden is invoking uh uh executive
president privilege to not release
it just imagine
that that there's a recording he had
with a you know uh let's say would it be
an officer of the government or the
court I don't know what you'd call them
but you know an official kind of person
so it's not like a personal
conversation right it's a conversation
he knew was being
recorded and that he did I would say
within His official
capacity which should make it available
to us right unless it's uh unless
there's like a secret
involved but he's invoking executive
privilege I don't know if it applies
maybe it does I don't think we
necessarily need to hear it do you and I
would agree with the White House's
interpretation that it's being requested
for political
reasons not for any business I think
that's
fair right I'd like to hear it but I
weirdly I'm going to back I'm going to
back the White House on this one I I
think the executive
privilege I feel like that needs to be
strong you know I say the same thing
with Trump say the same thing about
anything with Trump I think Executive
Privilege needs to stay strong and I
think it's funny that he's invoking it
in this situation but it it it's not
really going to prevent us from knowing
what we need to know it's not really
going to us in in anyway as a
country so I'm okay with it believe it
or not I'm okay with it so I'm I'm not
going to just reflexively say bad Biden
bad and everything else good yeah I'd
say let him let him have his secret
because is it really a secret do you do
you really need to know he said he's
going to do a
debate all questions will be answered in
the debate
um well there's a report that food
prices fell on the whole in April for
the first time in 12 months do you
believe that that's according to the
data released by the labor department a
department of the government releasing
data about the economy in a presidential
campaign year and it seems to suggest
something opposite of what we're
experiencing it's almost like the
government makes up in an election
year yeah don't believe it I don't know
if it's
false I'm saying that a
government economic data in an election
year has no credibility
whatsoever no credibility
whatsoever well Peter Navaro was not was
not a president yeah I'm hearing you say
Peter Navar was not allowed executive
privilege but I'm not I'm not going to
do the you know you did it to me so got
to do it to him kind of thing I'm still
going to call balls and Strikes Peter
Navaro and needs to be
free and Biden has dementia and uh but
we can still keep you know executive
privilege well and then there was
Senator Corey Booker now this gets to my
theme of
gaslighting I think we've we've left the
we've left field where all politicians
lie because that's just Baseline right
Baseline Trump gives a rally speech
CNN's going to find 26 things to
complain about in the fact check if we
looked at all of them we'd say oh okay I
see why you're factchecking that but
directionally it's true right so when
when Trump lies is almost always
directionally correct words if he says
there's crime coming across the border
there is directionally he's correct you
know
um so we've reached but we've reached
this
point where the gaslighting which is
different from lying lying is just
saying something that isn't true
gaslighting is looking right in your
face and telling you something isn't
true when you could see for yourself
it's true that's completely different so
gaslighting is not just about not being
true it's about telling you something is
not true when you can see is true you
can see it yourself it's obviously true
and they just say no you're not seeing
it um this cat has no head well I'm
looking at a cat I see it has a head no
it
doesn't I'm looking at a cat right in
front of me the same cat you're looking
at we're talking about the same cat yep
the cat has a head it's meowing no it's
not how do you explain the meowing if
the cat has no
head maybe you're imagining it I'm not
imagining it there's a cat right in
front of me there's a cat right in front
of me so gaslighting is different
because it actually makes you doubt your
sanity if you've never had it happen to
you trust me you can't understand
it it it cannot be explained to someone
who's not experienced
but as a nation we're about to
experience it together because Biden is
just going to tell you that the economy
is opposite of what you're observing
apparently that's the plan to just tell
you you don't see that what inflation
inflation I solved that a long time ago
what what do you mean inflation I I
don't know what you're talking about are
you sure you're okay are you off your
meds I'm worried about you maybe you
should see somebody professional if you
think the economy or the inflation is
high I'm a little bit worried about you
if you think inflation's High yeah
possibly it's the meds you're taking
have you gotten enough sleep so that's
how gaslighting works it's not about the
facts it's about the person you're
talking to and making them crazy and
we're pretty close to crazy
now so Senator Cory Booker said this in
the post he said inflation is down more
than 60 60% since its peak and core
inflation is at its lowest level in
three years uh the president's economic
policies are strengthening our economy
and reducing costs for American families
there's more to be done let's move
toward an economy that works for
everyone now that's something that a US
senator said in
public does that square with anything
you've heard or observed or F
really doesn't does it well thankfully
we have Charles Payne at Fox Business
who responds to Senator Booker and he
says quote
[Laughter]
golly I couldn't love that more if you
if you don't watch Charles Payne he's
pretty great at um his commentary he
goes golly Senator Booker you are too
smart for this kind of misinformation
infl inflation costs keep piling up at
an unacceptable rate Pace U but and then
he shows a graph and the graph is just
like a straight line up because it's
cumulative and I think Booker is looking
at maybe you know maybe some you know
period instead of looking at the uh
cumulative
effect so those are two
opposite things
it's either keeps going up or it's it's
down more than 60% do you think those
two things can be the same can you live
in a world where it's up 60% but also or
it's down 60% but it's also up every day
that's gaslighting you actually will
think you're crazy if you start
listening to this stuff meanwhile Mark
Cuban says uh they talking about some
good things in the economy he says
consumer bankruptcies or historic lows
consumers facing third party collections
are a record
lows um credit card balances are down
1.2% even though the population has
increased that's good isn't it household
debt as a percentage of income um not
counting covid uh and uh oh it's a it's
had a historic low except for Co and
used car prices are down 59%
so I guess that's a lot of good news for
the
economy
right
okay at the same time that's being
reported by Mark cubin and by the way I
think I think the numbers are all real
except there might be a little context
left out do you think little context
left out so for example the U the cost
of used cars coming down is that not
purely the effect of the pandemic being
over the reason used cars were so
expensive is because the pandemic am I
wrong about that so to quote that as a
statistic it's not really a sign of
Health in the economy it's very
cherry-picked yeah but Newsmax reporting
that roughly onethird of credit card
holders were delinquent on their
payments in 2023 and that's up 25% from
2019 this is from the Fed so could it be
could both of these things be true Mark
Cuban says credit card balances are down
just a little bit 1% or so but could it
be true that the balances are down but
the delinquencies are up of course he
can yeah there's no reason that they
can't both both be true so it could be
that people are you know holding back a
little bit the extra um borrowing
what what would be a reason that people
are adding less to their credit card
balances can you think of any reason
that they would add less to their credit
card
balances I I have a
suggestion could it be that Newsmax is
report that onethird of credit card
holders are delinquent would suggest
that maybe they're not adding to their
balance don't the credit card companies
stop letting you use their card if you
don't ever pay them back
am I wrong about that wouldn't the the
decrease in balances be because the
people are broke and they haven't paid
back the balance that they already have
on there and so the credit card company
says we can't give you any more credit
you already spent it all and you're not
paying
us yeah there's a little bit a little
bit of context left out a little bit of
context uh let's see what else uh 18% of
Max down their credit cards in the first
the first quarter of
2024 so if 18% maxed out their credit
cards by definition that's 18% of the
public who were unable to increase the
balance on their credit card why it was
maxed it couldn't go any
higher all
right uh in the hill there's an opinion
piece saying Biden has become detached
from economic
reality detached from economic reality
well I would like to suggest an idea for
a game show and the game show should be
um Biden says something and then there'
be a panel of contestants and the
contestants have to decide if what he
said is based on dishonesty or dementia
and that would be the name of the show
dishonesty or
dementia welcome to another episode of
dishonesty or dementia today Joe Biden
will be talking about the unemployment
rate uh the unemployment rate is
110% panel was that dishonesty or
dementia you can ask any question you
like uh where did you get that number
where did I get that number you dogface
pony soldier stop asking that
fatso all right was it Dementia or
dishonesty God they look so similar they
look exactly Al I don't know
so dishonesty or dementia you know that
came from one of the Trump
ads Great
Frame the dishonesty or dementia makes
you think past the sale the sale is it's
not
true but you have to decide which of the
two reasons makes it not true because
he's lying and he knows it or he can't
tell the
difference let me ask you
this when you hear Trump say something
that you don't think is true do you ever
think it's because he has
dementia no you don't I mean Democrats
might say that but they don't think
that only Biden you can't tell just
think about
that if you can't tell if it's
dishonesty and by the way dishonesty is
a way better word than lying because
lying is what everybody does but
dishonesty almost feels like its own
category because lying is so normal in
politics you know it's hyperbole
exaggeration leaving out context that's
so ordinary that we almost don't even
notice anymore because we you know we
discount it in our minds but
dishonesty would include you know
accepting gold bars and sewing it into
your suit like gold bar
Bob dishonesty suggests there's
something up with
Ukraine and and Hunter and all that so
dishonesty is a much better um political
word anyway dishonesty or dementia let's
keep that frame open um representative
Ayana
Presley uh was at some hearing talking
about uh I think it was sexual
harassment cases that were going um
unaddressed in the FDIC or something and
uh she's talking to the board and she
got all mad because it's a bunch of men
on the board and so that was kind of
bothering her and then she did her
little TI raade which was actually
pretty good I have to admit I had I
haven't heard much from her except weird
things out in context when she got going
and she was making her Point her point
was something like 80% of the sexual
harassment cases were being ignored
that's a pretty good point wouldn't you
agree like if that's
true that's a pretty good point and
maybe somebody needs to get in
somebody's faces face about that and she
did a really good job I have to say
she's impressive as a communicator she's
impressive um but then she ended it with
I'm so tired of white men failing
up
what I'm so tired of white men failing
up so the idea was that people only had
these jobs because they were
white now of course it's
racist and so I don't have to tell you
she was uh
immediately you know disavowed by all
Democrats and then she had to
resign because all the Democrats saw
this as racist it's so obviously racist
and they they banded together and
together uh what with the protests that
Soros funded against her the pressure
was too much and she had to retire so
she quit her job in disgrace no none of
that happened
nope nope it was just one day of
Republicans complaining about her being
a racist in public and nothing will
happen nope apparently you can be a
Democrat and just be full out racist and
it won't won't cost you a thing there
will be no push back whatsoever she has
a totally safe situation but totally
racist on the uh on another angle which
is the fashion angle if you haven't seen
the picture she's taken to dressing like
uh CLA Schwab she's got like this sci-fi
outfit on and the shaved shaved head I
don't know if she has alipa or something
but
uh but it's like a total CLA Schwab the
shaved head and the the Space Age outfit
it's kind of a good look if you think
I'm making fun of her I'm actually
not it was a good look you know if
you're G to have a shaved head and
you're a woman you might as well like go
for it like lean into it it looks like
that's what she did with like a style
you maybe like a style choice that would
you know detract from the the head it's
actually a pretty good pretty good look
I liked
it um Mitt Romney says provocatively
he's having too much fun uh he says that
Biden should have pardoned
Trump now you say to yourself what he's
such an anti-trumper why does he think
Biden should have pardoned him well he
gave this reason he goes why he goes
well because it makes me so he's
pretending if he's President Biden he
says it makes me President Biden the big
guy and the person I pardon the little
guy W that's actually a pretty good
point it's a pretty good point except
that obviously it doesn't work since the
person who had pardoned him is the one
who's behind the whole thing we assume
so no he's not going to Pardon him he's
the one who put him there in the first
place but it's a typical Romney thing I
think he's just having fun like I can't
imagine he's trying to accomplish
anything useful at this
point well meanwhile the new Dutch
leader is uh in in Holland is or the
doer putting together some strict Asylum
policies which would be different from
the rest of the European Union and so
the question I ask you is this this is a
uh gear Wilder and he's declaring he
calls it the strictest Asylum policy
ever in Dutch
history and uh it will do things like
not prioritize housing for Asylum people
to which I said why were they
prioritizing housing for Asylum people
but apparently they don't want to do
that anymore
um so that's sort of going against the
grain and we'll see what happens however
there is another leader over in that
part of the world who is also uh opposed
to the uh the eu's migration
rules or when I say there's another
leader I mean there used to be yesterday
until he was assassinated now I think
he's still alive but he has a number of
bullets in him they're trying to remove
Slovakian prime minister so he was shot
several times in public I think he's
still alive as of the last I checked
before I went on here but it didn't look
good and uh do you think that has
anything to do with anything
except that he's not going along with
the
program it feels like maybe that was one
of
ours it feels like maybe somebody
American was behind it I hate to
say anyway I have no reason to believe
that except that it would be
consistent um so
well let me let me put that in
context if I told you it seems to me
it's likely that America was behind the
assassination of the or attempted of
Slovakian prime minister because he
wasn't going along with whatever the
migration rules
are I don't think I ever before even
maybe this week would have said you know
there's a good chance America is behind
that I would have said that's ridiculous
why would we do that but given all we
know of what has happened to Flynn and
to Trump yeah that could happen sure if
you watch Ukraine you can see that this
looks like an ordinary business I would
say that's the most likely most likely
has some kind of state sponsorship to it
but we'll find out later could be just a
crazy person you never know but
apparently they think the slovakians
think it was political so not so much a
crazy
person uh poller John mclan mlin
according to just the news reports that
RFK Junu will take more votes from
Biden uh I think that's true I think RFK
Jr will take more votes from
Biden and uh some have suggested that
one of the reasons that Biden wants an
early debate is he has more chance of
keeping RFK JR out of it now RFK Jr said
in a post yesterday so this a little
confusion I have here he said he
qualified for the CNN
debate did you see that post so
yesterday I saw him say hey I qualified
for the debate as if he's going to be in
it now qualifying means I think you have
to have you know your polls have to be a
certain level before you can be in it
and but that doesn't mean that CNN
agreed right that only means that he
believes they should agree I don't
believe it means they
agreed now what I would expect is that
CNN will protect Biden even though they
are criticizing him um I
think that you know part of the reason
for even agreeing to the uh the debates
would be to freeze out RFK Jr so it
could be about
that but um uh here's my take on
it
uh oh I got to say one other thing
first um did you see Chuck Todd on one
of the shows he said that he thought
that RFK Jr's
voice uh would make that it would be
good to have RFK Jr on the debate stage
because it would make Biden look
stronger because his voice his voice he
says would make Biden look like a
stronger
candidate now I don't disagree with that
because we're very influenced by voice
and height and appear and hair and
attractiveness all that stuff yeah it
all counts definitely voice makes a
difference if you had a really annoying
voice you wouldn't go as far it's just
just a fact and and I will even go
further if he had not been a Kennedy I
doubt he would have been this far
because people do have a problem with
his voice privately it's the thing
people tell me the most they say yeah
well I can't even get interested in his
policies because I can't get past the
voice so it's a real issue um a lot of
people said Chuck Todd was being a dick
for bringing it up because it's a
disability to which I say yeah it's a
dick move it's a total dick move it's
also
true so you know sometimes maybe it's
good to have a dick to tell you what
only somebody who's a total dick would
say out loud if it matters and I do
think it matters now I will tell you
that I have offered to help RFK Jr fix
his voice because I think there might be
a quick fix but I don't know what maybe
one in five odds it's not not high odds
and it goes like this uh if you've heard
his sister talk you know she's got a
similar propensity she doesn't have the
condition but you can tell there's a
weakness there that you maybe easily
could have gone over to a full spasmodic
dysphonia
and I think that both of them speak from
their
throat meaning that they produce
words uh down in the throat like
this now if I right now I'm I'm
producing my voice in my throat uh I
don't know if you can tell but if I
still had the problem of spasmodic
dysphonia you wouldn't be able to hear a
word I say because of where I'm
producing the voice because I'm
producing it at the very place the
problem is the vocal chords
but watch
this okay now I'm up in the top of my
head if you use humming as your
Technique the humming allows you to
Center the production where you produce
the voice and you can move it up out of
your throat and into What's called the
mask of your face so if you raise your
tone a little bit uh when you want it to
be deep and have a deep voice you tend
you tend to go down into your Thro to
produce it but if you don't mind talking
a little bit higher and and the audience
won't mind you can do what I'm doing
right now which is using perfect
technique to talk I say I think there's
at least a 20% chance since this
technique is not common and it's not
even taught by uh voice
professionals this technique you would
never even run into if all you did is
talk to regular voice professionals this
is something that you know one voice
doctor taught me and I walked down to
there being able to almost talk normally
even before the
surgery the trouble is you have to
practice it over and over and over again
and I couldn't keep up with it but I did
see people completely cured with nothing
but humming and practicing this
technique people had the condition cured
with no medicine or surgery just
changing where they produce their voice
so I speculate
that there's at least a 20% chance that
RFK Jr has never been exposed to the
technique but once
exposed it could take half a minute to
master
it so there's a 20%
chance that he could speak perfectly
before the
election isn't that
weird I I would bet against it I'll bet
against it 80 to 20 I'll bet against it
but I don't think I know if he's ever
been exposed to this technique I'm using
it right now by the way so you do have
to use it consciously you have to remind
yourself to you know to produce the the
sound up
here somebody saw a video of me a few
years ago and said my voice sounded
different I think that's true because
I've been practicing producing my voice
up in the top of my head there was a
time when I couldn't talk for more than
10 minutes without getting a horse and
that was because I was using wrong
technique anyway the two debates um here
are the things
that that Biden is asking for uh no RFK
Jr just the two of them microphone's off
when Trump is talking uh Democrat groups
would be hosting it you know like
CBS and
CNN and uh there's having it early which
would give by plenty of time to recover
if it doesn't go well but I would add
that it gives him plenty of time to
replace him I think that is his advisors
probably want it to happen as soon as
possible because if it's a total
disaster well you can still replace them
if he had to I mean if it's really that
bad you could replace them but here's my
take I think that uh Biden is doing a
Gavin Nome which is the the dilbur
strategy you know how have gav Nome said
uh reparations hey that's a great idea
why don't you go study it and come back
and basically using the bureaucracy to
kill something that he can't kill on his
own so it's like yeah form a committee
make a
recommendation no maybe you should study
it some more just making it go away I
think that's what Biden is doing with
the
debates I don't think he necessarily
thinks he's going to
debate I think think he was trying to
make it so hard that it just wouldn't
happen and I think that that's going to
get even stronger because I think he's
going to make up a reason that he
couldn't possibly be on the stage with
that criminal
Trump something like that but the other
possibility is and this is the one I
like the
best his staff hates him
Biden I think his staff hates him
and here's why because they're not
stopping him from
debating I think that Biden thinks he
can do it because he doesn't know how
degraded he is his staff knows he can't
and they just gave up and said you know
what like if you can pull it off go
ahead but we can't help you anymore so
if you're going to go down in flames
let's do this right away Le let's get
the Flaming over with and then maybe we
can go on with our lives so it might be
capitulation you might be seeing
capitulation where they just gave up
said all right go go debate good luck
with that nobody will know if it's
dishonesty or
dementia so maybe they gave
up uh looks like CNN's uh anchors will
be Jake Tapper and Dana
Bash they're going to be tapping and
bashing tapping and bashing anyway uh so
they'll be the
moderators uh speaking of Jake
Tapper um he was mentioning on air that
President Biden lied in his last debate
with Trump when Trump said that uh
Hunter Biden was getting money from
China and Biden acted like he didn't
know the country
China you need to hear the
reply because Biden you know so Trump
makes the
accusation that Hunter took Millions
from China and then Biden when he's
defending himself he goes and he and he
said uh he took money from uh uh
China he acted like he hadn't hurted the
country China is it
called what what's the name of that
China China I think is the country
you're talking about yeah I've heard of
it but even Jake Tapper is saying Biden
lied directly so that's CNN Jake Tapper
which I'll give him credit for he's
saying he lied what happens what happens
if I if he's asked again if he's asked
again is he going to say it didn't
happen like he did the last
time or or will the question be the last
time you were asked you said he hadn't
since then it's a matter of fact that he
did take money from
China what do you say
now what does he say
now don't you think the CNN maybe got
the memo that Biden needs to be taken
out I
think Jake Tapper and Dana Bash are
being sent as
assassins to make sure that Biden does
not survive to the uh
convention maybe just
speculating all right there's a paper
study from uh some author named Michael
monrie and another one named Pierre
linard and they say that what causes
radicalization is
Envy the Envy causes
radicalization may I make a suggestion
for next time you could save a lot of
time and a lot of money if you would
just ask
Scott Scott we're thinking of doing this
major research to find out if Envy is in
any way related to all the protests and
the
radicalization and I would have
said
yes and they would said are you sure and
I would have said yes and they would say
well how can you be so sure and I would
say have you ever seen a
protest and they would say well yes I've
seen many of them how many millionaires
are at the pr
test
um not a
lot that's right do you know why
millionaires don't
protest why no Envy they're doing fine
it's only people are not doing fine who
protest and they only protest because
other people are not doing are doing
better if nobody had money would there
be an occupi Wall Street no no right
yeah and everything is about somebody
has something that you wish they didn't
have so it's Envy yeah all all protest
or Envy but beyond that they're also
fake breitbard is reporting that uh
there's some China
money then made its way into left ring
wing groups that are doing the
anti-israel protests in the US are you
surprised are you surprised that any
Chinese
money made get into those protests no
not really not too surprised so you've
got George Soros and China on the same
side you have funding groups that are
protesting
well um I was talking to my to my
uh smartest uh Democrat friend I
mentioned him once in a while it's fun
to have somebody who's really smart and
well informed who disagrees with you
totally because then you can see you
know the depth of the brainwashing and
the gaslighting and it's really it's
miraculous but uh he is a graduate of
one of these uh IV League schools that's
having little issues right
now and I hate to enjoy it as much as I
am but do you know why I am do you know
why I enjoy that he went to a better
school than I did and they're having
protests Envy
Envy yeah if I'd gone to the college he
went to as an
undergraduate I'd feel completely
differently but now I just have
Envy not really I don't have much Envy I
guess everybody has a little bit but I
don't have a lot all right ladies and
gentlemen I'm going to uh reiterate the
most useful thing I've ever
done uh I was sort of keeping track the
other day of you know have I done
something useful in this world you know
did did I do anything that anybody cares
about the leony value and I'll tell you
one of the things I'm most proud of is
that
um that alcohol is
poison has been so effective and I don't
know how many people have quit drinking
because I just told them alcohol is
poison and it's not because I said it
it's because the framing is so uh
persuasive but
maybe dozens or hundreds of people by
now have told me that they quit drinking
really just from that the one reframe
alcohol is poison and I think to
myself if I could get a thousand people
to quit
drinking I'm almost certainly going to
save somebody's life or at least change
some lives and I thought well that's
pretty
good and I thought if I didn't do
anything else like if if the whole rest
of my life produced nothing
that'd be pretty good like I'd feel like
all right I got that one thing done
helped helped dozens or maybe hundreds
of people and but then something
happened uh the other day that I'm going
to reiterate so you've heard this before
but I mention it because it's just so
useful um I was doing a live stream the
other day uh just to my subscribers on
locals and somebody asked me for a
reframe to help them get out of their
head and you know stop having
ruminations and bad thoughts and I
suggested the reframe of that I tried
myself and it worked where you just say
get out just get out of your head now
the frame that makes it work is to
realize that you are a person who has
two completely different lives this is
the key there's a part of you that lives
only in your head where you think about
the past which literally doesn't exist
it it's imaginary it existed at one
point but now it's just the thoughts of
the past but you also have thoughts of
oh what will happen in the future I'm
worried about the future and that
doesn't
exist so so the life you live in your
head is a completely imaginary one so
things of the history in your past that
don't exist anymore and worries about
the future that doesn't exist yet but
the outside world is all real stuff
you know stuff you in touch breathe
sense and we live in both of those
worlds we go back and forth and so the
idea that I had that worked when I did
it was I just said get out and I what I
meant was get out of the imaginary world
and get into the real one and just walk
out in the sun walk out the door pet the
dog do a chore
exercise just get out and so suggested
it to my subscribers or a few hundred of
them watching in the man cave I said hey
if you have this problem you know try
this thing just say get out get out and
then I followed up and a whole bunch of
people just like a wall of people saying
yes it worked it worked it worked and I
thought really did that really work now
if I hadn't seen you know and
experienced that alcohol as poison
caused dozens or hundreds or even
thousands I have no idea of people to
quit drinking which is a tough thing to
do I wouldn't have imagined that just
two words get out could cure somebody's
mental problems or at least at the
moment and so I said you if there's
somebody who hasn't tried it yet go
ahead and try it and then I checked in
again last
night oh my
God apparently it's curing mental
illness
instantly really like actually and so
I'm going to ask you this as a favor try
it once just try it once just tell
yourself you have two worlds there's the
imaginary one in your head and then
there's a real one and all sadness comes
from the imaginary one everything that's
mental illness is the imaginary one now
you want me to take it one step further
all right you want want me to connect
all the dots you ready for this ready to
have your mind blown you know there's a
huge increase in uh mental
illness and uh phones have been blamed
for that but what exactly is the
mechanism by which a phone causes mental
illness let me suggest that phones make
you live in your imaginary world longer
than you would normally be there when
I'm on my phone and I'm looking at
somebody else I'm imagining myself
compared to them in my imaginary
world so every minut you're spending on
social
media with other people's imaginary
worlds it brings you into your imaginary
world because you're looking at people
who don't really have those lives just
the way they look right they're they're
giving you an impression it's an
imaginary and so my my speculation on
the
mechanism is that using phones doesn't
just keep you awake it doesn't just give
you envy it does give you envy it
doesn't just do that it doesn't just
distract you it doesn't just cause you
to exercise less it causes you to be
inside your
head and that will make you batshit
crazy and the cure for it is to y'll get
out as soon as you find unpleasantness
because you're in your head get out
just get out join the real world just go
Z hey I'm in the real world again look
at
this real world you'll feel instantly
better and so as a public
service uh I would like to cure all the
uh alcohol
overuse and all the mental illness in
the United States and if I can get that
done I'll feel like I did almost enough
and that ladies and gentlemen is all I
have for you I expect all of you to try
it tomorrow and if you're not convinced
yet oh I wish you could see all the
comments that I can see because I can
see all the comments but if you're on
the other platforms you only see your
own so tomorrow I'm going to ask you how
many of you tried it so I want all the
YouTube people the the ex people and the
rumble people uh you tell me if you
tried it by tomorrow and watch what
happens if you haven't tried it you're
going to see a wall of yeses where
people said holy crap why did that work
now the next thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to make a a very small
two-minute video in which I explain this
technique because if it works you're
going to want to share it so uh let me
do that as a public service normally
that would only be for the subscribers
at locals let me ask subscribers on
locals you wouldn't mind if I released
this to everybody even though you play
pay a subscription to see the good stuff
right everybody okay with that um
because the thing is that locals we talk
about this when we're private uh has
become sort of a
brain where I'm sort of like the host of
the brain but the brain does the
thinking it's like the the group of
people and this wouldn't have happened
you know the get out thing that couldn't
have happened except somebody in the
community asked me the question I
speculated you know took a shot at it
and then the crowd tested it and then
the crowd told me it worked so it's like
it was one giant brain you know with a
little bit of orchestration but I wasn't
the brain the brain was the larger
group and that's cool so ladies and
gentlemen on the other platforms I'm
going to spend some time with the locals
people privately but
be sure to come back tomorrow and let me
know if that worked so goodbye to
YouTube and Rumble and the xplatform I'm
going to say hi just to the locals
people see you
tomorrow
