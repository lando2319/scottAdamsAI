oh
well ladies and gentlemen i'm running a
little bit late this morning
so you're seeing the unprepared version
of me
watch me print my notes and close my
blackout shutters and
pull up my comments
without even missing a beat
because that's what i do
all right
oh damn it
i'm not gonna be able to do what i want
to do
all right hold on locals people
gonna make a quick adjustment here
and then
everything will be cool
well people on
youtube you're seeing the show before
the show it's the one that
usually only the local subscribers say
i can't reach my notes i have to unplug
hold on
you know what i say about quality
totally overrated
yeah i could try to make this a quality
program
but who would want to watch that really
i think you'd rather watch me struggle
and
and fail
let's see
let's see
in one moment i'm going to be up and
running here
how many of you found empty shelves
today
uh
god damn it
okay
for some reason that didn't work hold on
again
i'm having a technical technical
difficulty
tweet fail to send
for some reason i can't tweet i wonder
what that would be
is twitter
down um weirdly if i can't tweet i can't
see your comments
oh and now i'm all up here
all right well i'm gonna have to keep uh
this on this perspective
wow
your local store had no spaghetti are
you kidding me
how the hell do you run out of spaghetti
that's pretty bad
all right
so
i know why you're here and something
that has to do with the simultaneous sip
and all you need is a couple of glasses
of tango chelsea stein canteen juggle
flash vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better except my punctuality
is called
the simultaneous sip and watch it
improve your antibodies now go
um
my favorite story of the day
was in the huffington post
the huffington
post ah antibodies yeah
and the huffington post reports that uh
this is the headline
daniel craig you know him he plays james
bond
prefers going to gay bars and you
probably can't guess why
that's right
daniel craig he prefers going to gay
bars and you probably can't guess why
i think i can
i'm going to take that challenge
and i think i'm going to guess
why he goes to gay bars
well i think i'll keep my guess to
myself
but i've got a i've got a hypothesis
why a good-looking actor
would go to a gay bar
time and time again with his gay friend
often
um
the article was written by in huffington
post
by ron dicker
d-i-c-k-e-r ron dicker
so
i don't know maybe you could
meet this challenge too
why would a actor
go to a gay bar
i don't know i'm stumped
i assume it's because the drinks were
low-cost
maybe
better parking
i don't know could be a lot of reasons
have i told you
that following the money always predicts
now here's everybody knows that if you
follow the money
people tend to do whatever is in their
financial interest right no no surprise
there but it also works
and i don't know why
where it shouldn't work
let me give you an example
uh remember the story about the elk that
had a tire
that somehow it got a tire around his
neck but then its antlers grew
so couldn't get the tire off
so after years of people sighting this
elk they i guess they tranquilized it
and
they removed the tire
but the way they removed the tire is by
removing the the elk's antlers
now that's not a big deal because
antlers regrow every season but
people ask well wouldn't it make more
sense to cut the tire
you know why why wouldn't you cut the
tire
just leave the antlers
and
i got the best the best answer to that
from grover norquist
you all you might recognize that name
all of the news junkies know that name
grover norquist so he's uh he's most
famous for
uh
being against extra taxes
yeah he's the low tax
guy
so we follow each other on twitter and
uh grover saw that story
and in answer to the question why the
tire was removed instead of the no why
the antlers were removed instead of the
tires
grover tweets
they could not sell the tire for as much
as antlers
they could not sell the tire for as much
as antlers
i thought to myself
well that's probably true
they probably didn't throw away the
antlers didn't they
because it seems like
do people buy them
for i don't
i guess they do right people buy antlers
is that a thing
now here's here's the funny part
i don't personally believe
that that had anything to do with why
they removed it the way they did
but
watch how often it predicts
you you'll see a situation in which
there's no way the money makes any
difference it's like a big
psychological decision or it's
political or it's health related but
it's definitely not about the money
but coincidentally
the decisions will always be in the same
direction as the money
even if it's not much and even if the
other decisions are other variables are
way bigger
it's just something to watch for let's
say for fun
i i will not assert
that it works in some statistically
meaningful way
i just know that my observation is it
always works
i assume that's confirmation bias
it couldn't always work right
that can't be true
it can't always work
but it looks like it
i mean it's hard to find any maybe you
just don't notice the exceptions that
could be the case maybe the exceptions
are just boring and they don't they
don't make even notice
all right
last night i'm told
tucker carlson had a
segment
about the auckland i think is a
professor who did a study and and
determined that the havana syndrome the
so-called secret microwave
sonic weapon
there was injuring diplomats in our
embassies
probably was nothing but
mass hysteria
now
how many of you saw that
how many of you watched tucker's episode
about the havana syndrome
possibly not being real
a lot of you saw it
here's the funny thing
i record tucker every night you know i
just i have an app that works with my
comcast slash
xfinity
and i recorded that show every night as
long as well as you know gupfield and
the five
so so those are three shows that i
record every day
the only show
that doesn't have audio on my recordings
is this one
the ones i recorded yesterday are all
fine
and in fact the show before tucker's was
fine
like it has a little lead in it records
a like a minute before the show starts
and that has audio as soon as tucker
starts the audio goes off
and i thought to myself oh darn it's my
device so i went to a different device
same thing
the the app is called stream and it's
part of the xfinity
the cable company where i live so it's
the cable companies app
so
here's the weird part
there's nothing i've wanted to see more
than that episode
because
it agreed with me
right
so so yesterday uh
you know i heard that
tucker had something that doubted the
that there was a weapon
now most of you know i think i'm the
only public figure
who said on day one of that whole
embassy of anna syndrome thing that's
it's mass hysteria and there's no weapon
so the fact that there would be a major
segment on a major news channel even an
opinion show
was really really interesting to me
because i have skin in the game
why is it that the only thing i can't
play
no i looked for it on youtube and i look
for the clips and it doesn't exist
now here's the interesting thing
part of the
story and i don't know if tucker talked
about this but part of the the story
whether talker talked about it or not
is that uh the media has been reporting
this is true that there's some kind of
weapon maybe probably
allegedly
in nbc and cnn
uh is
uh nbc has been part of that reporting
and as you know if you follow glenn
greenwald especially nbc is often
accused of being the the cia's
captured
network
meaning that nbc news basically reports
what the cia wants them to report
now i'm not saying that's true
i'm saying that's that's the uh that's
the allegation
and you see people like glenn greenwald
back up the allegation quite well
so i'm saying it's an allegation with a
lot of evidence
that's all i know
so you've got an
nbc
still trying to sell this thing as maybe
some kind of a russian weapon
which sounds exactly like this something
the cia would want you to believe if
they want to put pressure on russia and
they need the public to back them
and
i'm asking you this
what are the odds that that one thing
that the cia doesn't want you to see
allegedly right we don't we can't
confirm that but what are the odds that
the one thing that the cia doesn't want
you to see also is the one thing that
can't be seen
it's not anywhere else
can somebody find a clip of that just
that segment
of the auckland professor talking about
the havana syndrome
and and tweeted at me
because i wonder if it exists
i wonder if it's already been scrubbed
from the internet
is that a coincidence
because you have to ask yourself is the
one thing that you know the cia doesn't
want you to see
when i say you know it
let's say you're let's say you're highly
confident we can't know anything in
today's world so certainly any absolute
confidence of anything is ridiculous in
2021
but it feels like it
just a coincidence that that's the one
thing i can't watch i know
probably a coincidence let me let me say
clearly
probably a coincidence
but the fact that i have to even ask the
question is very disturbing isn't it
like why do i even have to doubt
that that happened naturally just a
technical problem
i don't know i hate that i have to ask
the question
how many of you think taiwan is at real
risk of
uh china attacking militarily in the
comments
in the comments how many of you think
there's a real risk
of a military attack and let's say in
the next two years
next two years risk of a military attack
i'm seeing some yeses and some low low
percentages like five percent
um
okay i yeah so
somebody here pedantically is saying yes
there's a risk okay technically
technically there's a risk right so i
would say that's a given
that there's a risk
it's just so small
so cnn had a uh opinion piece on this i
thought was pretty good i forget who
wrote it but the point of it is that
there's not really any indication that
china is too serious
about a military attack
and i saw a map
of the
the incursions
which was very interesting because i'd
never seen it before it was some context
about all these military planes that
china is putting into
taiwan's airspace
now when you heard that
what did your mind
give you as a picture
when you heard that
chinese warplanes lots of them
were suddenly penetrating taiwan
airspace what did your brain
give you as a picture for that
like what was the little
the visual that you got you gave it to
yourself because you didn't see a visual
but what did it look like
did it look like planes flying directly
over taiwan
probably not because you're
sophisticated viewers of the news and
you said to yourself no no not over the
land
they were over the airspace
meaning that over the ocean
around taiwan
that china claims as their own
right
i saw a picture of that incursion
let me show you what it looked like now
my picture is not to scale
and it's not the same dimensions but
i'll give you the idea
imagine if you will
that this napkin
is the space that taiwan claims for
their airspace
let's say taiwan is right in the middle
and occupies maybe i don't know
20 of the space but it's in the middle
here
maybe even 10
where do you think the all the chinese
uh incursions were
they're all on this corner right here
that's it maybe a little bit more
that's it
it was in this weird little corner
which taiwan when it draws its airspace
around itself it declares its own
airspace
so i don't think it's an international
standard
it's just taiwan saying hey this is our
space
and china just flies directly out and
they cross this little corner
of the ocean that taiwan claims as their
airspace
how many of the flights were in all of
this other area
none
none
they were all just this little corner
all china did was clip this corner but
they did a lot
you know hundreds of times but just this
little corner
that's it if they had flown here
like just outside this little corner we
wouldn't be talking about it
but because they clipped the corner
we're talking about it
now what gives taiwan the right to this
little this little this little piece
right here
the only piece that was violated what
gives taiwan that right
nothing
nothing
taiwan just claimed the right
they just said hey this is ours and and
i looked at you know my example is bad
because it's uh symmetrical
but the actual airspace is more
i don't know it's more like weird shaped
something like this
so the corner that china is clipping off
is sort of the extended corner
it's the one that looks a little
furthest
from the island itself
am i wrong that if you had seen that
picture from the start
and known that the violation is the most
trivial violation that they could get
away with
china is violating their airspace of
course but in the most trivial way
according to the the picture and i had
never seen the picture until today
yeah it's still provocative etc but the
people who seem to be smart on this
topic don't think there's any real risk
it looks like it may be for
internal politics because there's some
big chinese meeting coming up so it's
probably just for internal reasons
so i think you can stop worrying about
that one right away
um
well finally the company is the country
is coming together
because the people who are against
vaccination mandates
are gloriously
gloriously
all over the map
so you got your you know black lives
matter you got your
christian conservatives
you got your police officers you got
your teachers
so you got your
democrats you got your republicans
i can't think of another issue that
unified the country this much
can you
airline pilots thank you
yeah
it's uh
it's weirdly
i want to feel
i want to join the rest of you and feel
anxious and bad
about the division in the country
because we're all talking about it
but i'm not feeling it
like i know it's there i'm not denying
the division in the country i'm just
saying that
a lot of this stuff looks like the
normal and maybe even preferred
evolution of thought
meaning the fact that the government
took control during the
emergency
wouldn't you want that
don't you want the government to take a
firm control even if they make mistakes
it's your best bet during an emergency
i can see somebody says no well i like
that you're consistent
so i appreciate the people saying no i
don't want that i don't want the
government to ever take control in any
situation
that i feel that's a
that's a legitimate opinion and i won't
i won't criticize it because it's
consistent i imagine that those saying
that just always say that so if you're
consistent
i support you
so let me just put it in my opinion in
my opinion
because obviously a lot of you disagree
in my opinion the government needs to
take control in military matters and and
maybe a big crisis like this did they do
it well that's a separate question but i
think it's your best bet
now i'll accept that you disagree with
me on that
but
it's only good if the if the people can
take it back
the people need to regain you know grab
it back and of course the government
when it takes power it doesn't like to
give it up at all
we know that right but we have plenty of
examples of let's say hurricanes
where the government took power during
the hurricane as an emergency
and as soon as they were done they got
out of there as soon as they could
because they didn't want to be there
grabbing any power they just wanted to
do the job and leave
and what i see is as these this anti-vax
coalition
which isn't organized in any sense but
sort of a informally you know natural
coalition without organization
i feel good about it
i feel good that there's a balance of
power
the government took control
um most of you disagree but i thought
well it was our best bet even if it is
it's not ideal
but it might have been our best bet
that's how you get the vaccines etc
but i love the fact that the country is
starting to push back
and i'm not even you know it doesn't
even matter that i'm on the side of the
pushback people or not i like that they
exist
it's a good it's a good reminder to the
government who's in charge
so the more people who resist and the
more actively they resist i'm not saying
i'm on their side or not on their side
they can make their own decisions what i
say is i like living in a country where
it's happening
i like living in a country where the
government can take control
and then the people can say you know
just about now
is when you need to be giving it back
and they won't take no for an answer
that's not all bad right it's an
uncomfortable place to be we're not
happy where we are we'd like to be in a
better place i get all that
but i like that our system allows this
constructive tension between government
and the people and so far i still see
the people having the power
it might take a while
it's not going to be instant but i think
the people will get what they want i
believe the mandates will not stand
what do you think
do you think the mandates will stand
i think they'll stand in some places
but i don't imagine that the people will
let them stand for long and certainly
not everywhere
yeah i think there'll be too much too
much pushback eventually
so i've got this question whether we
have a supply chain problem or the
simulation
has been proven
when i go to the local local grocery
store
where i live the shelves are basically
full
right if you look down the row of
shelves it looks full
with one exception
you'll see this long row of products
and then there'll be this little hole in
the shelf
no more than this big
in a gigantic line everything's full but
just this little bit
that little
hole represents the product i came for
and i'm like oh crap the one thing i
want
is the only thing missing
so i go to the next aisle to look for
the other thing i'm looking for
and there's only one thing missing
and it's the damn thing i want
now i noticed this first during the
pandemic
christina asked me for some like very
specific things a specific brand of soda
which literally disappeared during the
pandemic
it doesn't exist anymore
as soon as she started saying this is
the only soda i want
it just disappeared
it was
dr pepper
no caffeine
and also diet
just disappeared
i think that's that's what it was and
likewise she had a you know a food
product
that was on a shelf with all the food
products were there except that one
that one food just disappeared and never
came back
now
is that the
am i supposed to believe that the one
thing i look for is the thing that's
missing
here's the other possibility
so one is that's just a coincidence and
it's confirmation bias and i don't
notice the other things that are missing
you know just normal psychological
phenomenon
but it's also very consistent with us
being in a simulation here's why
because
there's nobody else buying food
if this is a simulation
i'm the only one buying food
and everything else is an illusion
right
so the npcs don't buy food
they just look like it when you're
shopping
they look like they're buying food
but as soon as you leave they empty the
carts and put it all back on the shelves
so here's my point
if the simulation has a bug
the only thing that's going to be
missing is the food that you buy
because it's your simulation
the generic food that's the background
food that you'll never buy is just there
to create scenery
it never changed and there was no bug in
it so the only thing changed was the
your specific food
now i'm not too serious
uh jen says oh my god scott where is
your brain gone
simulation theory is such an illusion
now jen do you know that uh
elon musk
has the same opinion i do about the
simulation
and the actual scientists and
philosophers who know what they're
talking about do
it's accepted science
in the sense that it's accepted as a
serious
alternative uh understanding of reality
doesn't mean it's true
but it is completely accepted
by smart people as well maybe
all right
by the way i just did that one for fun
i'm not too serious about the supply
chain thing
uh trump has uh
said some new provocative things about
arizona
uh which i will not tell you are true
okay so i'm going to tell you a bunch of
things that trump says
but uh don't don't imagine that i say
any of this is true
is that clear
i don't know that it's untrue
i don't have an opinion on it true or
untrue but we'll talk about in a moment
so these are trump's claims
um talking about uh a couple of
precincts in pubert pima pima
arizona
and apparently there are great
irregularities there trump and others
have claimed and trump says they
overplayed their hand and got caught two
precincts in pima
had over 100 turnout for mail-in ballots
which is impossible and 40 precincts had
over 97 returned which basically
impossible
um
and that if you add these things
together the irregularities is more than
the amount enough the margin to win
turn a turnout rates of 99 and 100
is what you get in a third world country
blah blah blah
so
and he shows a uh a graph in his
statement
now the graph that he showed
to demonstrate that there was a certain
time of night when all the ballots
turned in a different direction
i think it was dr shiva's
his analysis
so
here's my question
why is trump
complaining about arizona irregularities
and not using information that came from
the arizona audit
wasn't the arizona audit
on his side
what am i missing in the story can
somebody connect the dots for me
how could it be that dr shiva
has this solid
incontrovertible
evidence that trump is putting forward
now how could dr shiva have that
but the people who were certainly
looking for that
the arizona audit they didn't have that
they didn't have that
or they didn't believe it enough to put
that forward as a claim
a different county
is that why was it
so so pima wasn't part of the maricopa
audit okay that's the answer thank you
remember i was telling you yesterday
that this model that we have
where i talk out loud and you correct me
in real time
it is effectively like a different form
of intelligence
because in real time you just basically
fixed my brain
because i was i couldn't connect why
there was a disconnect there it was just
a different county
so that's the answer okay
now
if you didn't know anything except what
i just told you
and that describes most of us if you
didn't know anything but what i just
told you trump makes these claims
dr shiva seems to be the source of some
some part of it
and it claims more than you know
something close to 100 turnout which
would be impossible how credible are
these claims go
don't tell me whether they're true or
false because you don't know
we don't know if they're true or false
we don't know if true or false had
changed the election only is it credible
meaning is that the kind of thing you
would be
inclined to believe because of its
nature and maybe the source and
everything you know about life
credible or not credible
i'm just looking at your answers and i
see
not interestingly
i thought most of you are going to say
yes
i really thought you were going to say
yes
interesting
i'm kind of uh
shocked
i'm blown away
so i think most of you are
are good with the difference between
what is credible
versus what is true
often you can't know what's true but you
can tell if the claim is
credible
all right so some of you think it's
credible some of you think it's not um i
told you at the beginning of the process
of the election and the audits
that 95 of everything you see
about a claim of irregularity
without even knowing what the claims
would be
before they even happened i told you 95
would be bunk
was i right
how was my prediction
that 95 of the specific claims not not
the general idea that there was a fraud
i'm not talking about the general idea
i'm talking about specific claims i said
95 of them would be false maybe 100
but then at least 95 of them would be
false how close was i
one of my best
predictions because no matter what you
think about whether the election was
fair or not overall
would you agree with me at this point
that the specific claims
have 90 95 well you could say 100
been debunked
true true or not
i think that's one of my best
best predictions of all time because
again i'm the only person saying that
that i that i know of
i can't think of anybody else who said
no 95 of everything you hear is going to
be wrong
he only provided data not claims
how are you measuring this i'm not
measuring it with any science
i'm just saying that i haven't seen any
claims that have been confirmed yet
so
predicting that 95 of them or more would
not be confirmed seems to be pretty
close to the mark
no all right
so let's keep an eye on that that's kind
of fun
um
there's something happening here that's
really interesting
now i might i think some of you are
going to imagine i've changed my opinion
when you hear this next part
because on twitter today i think i saw
at least three people
uh hallucinating my opinion
and telling me that you know it's about
time i came to the right opinion because
i was so wrong before
to which i say
i never had that opinion you thought i
had
i never had that opinion so some of you
are going to have that experience in a
moment
you could have an experience that you
think i changed an opinion
that isn't going to happen but see if
you feel like it
tell me in the comments if it feels like
i changed my opinion just feels like
that to you okay
i've told you before
that one way i judge the truth of things
in the news
is i look for a correspondence between
what the science says
and what direct observation tells me now
if my direct observation conflicts with
what the science says
it doesn't mean the observation is right
it means i've got questions
for example
science says that smoking cigarettes
can give you cancer
my observation
is that people who have lung cancer
almost always smoke cigarettes
very good
compatible totally compatible right
science says if you take this antibiotic
your
bacterial infection will probably go
away
i take the the i take the drugs
my infection goes away good science and
observation pretty good they can form
but
science is also telling us that very few
people are being injured by vaccinations
science is very clear about that
yes people can be injured by any kind of
vaccination really any kind of medicine
but they're not many
not many at least compared to the number
of people who are having uh covent
problems
but i asked on twitter because people
keep telling me anecdotally that they
know people who are injured by
vaccinations now first first question
does anybody know
that somebody in their circle was
injured by the vaccination do they know
it
or is it just that they got the
vaccination then a very unusual
health problem happened soon after
you agree they don't know it right
they just have a strong strong suspicion
so strong that they they speak of it as
if it's obvious
right
now could
in and you also know that in a big
country there would be coincidences like
that that would look exactly like people
were being injured even if they weren't
don't give me the verse database because
that's a different story
all right
so here's my opinion that you're going
to think is a change of opinion but it
isn't
you ready um so i asked on twitter how
many people personally know people who
are injured by the vaccination that
doesn't mean they know it means i
strongly suspect it and it's a lot
it's a lot
the people who say i personally know
people or multiple people
that they believe
were injured by the vaccine it's a lot
so
what do i have now
i've got the science telling me one
thing that the the side effects are rare
and then i've got personal observation
but it's really the third hand personal
observation
really all i can observe is people
telling me they observed something
pretty sketchy right but if i had
observed it myself
i would like likewise be subject to
confirmation bias
so so the fact that other people are
telling me and maybe they have
confirmation bias
probably doesn't change much because if
i had directly seen it myself i'd
probably have the same confirmation bias
so
let me say this as clearly as possible
and tell me if you think this is a
change of my opinion
there is clearly a disconnect
between observation and science
are you happy
everybody happy
how many of you have been beating me up
saying scott scott scott
there's so many people you know i can
hear all these reports it's in the
veyres database which is not confirmed
stuff
are you happy
i too
i too see what you see
meaning that it is clear to me there is
a disconnect between the science and the
observation
that does not mean the science is wrong
you all get that right doesn't mean the
science is wrong
but it is a big honking red flag
so all of you who keep telling me scott
scott scott
why are you missing the big red flag
i'm not
i'm not it's a big red flag exactly like
you say but just be aware
that confirmation bias is still the most
likely explanation
i don't know that that's the explanation
again i can't be sure of that just like
i can't be sure that the reports are
real
i can't be sure of anything at this
point
but yes i am completely on the side that
says
there's something going on here and i
don't feel like we're fully informed
that's different from saying you
shouldn't take a vaccination
right
i'm not saying you shouldn't get
vaccinated and i'm not saying you should
i'm saying that this is one of those
perfectly
crafted situations accidentally crafted
in which
your science and your observation
they've got some disconnect
i would say that's true
i still think it's probably confirmation
bias
plus
probably these vaccinations have more
side effects than others
probably
that's as far as i can go
all right
chris vickers
blue checkmark fellow on twitter you've
probably never heard of him but he's a
blue check he tweeted this today he goes
set a date now
after that date no hospital services for
the willingly unvaccinated
so it's a blue check twitter person
calling for unvaccinated people
do not have
medical care
after a certain date because you know
they've been warned you've been warned
to which i tweeted back
if we didn't need to treat citizens who
injured themselves by their own choices
one way or another
we would we could close 90 percent of
our hospitals and still have extra
capacity
so chris
have you not noticed that most of the
reasons people are in the hospital are
bad choices
now you think this one's a bad choice
other people don't so i'll recognize
that people disagree whether vaccination
is a good or bad choice
but
that's mostly what the medical
community does
the entire medical community
is correcting for your dumb ass mistakes
i mean of course people are dying from
natural causes but
when was the last time you saw somebody
in the hospital waiting room or the
emergency room who looked perfectly fit
and if they do it's a broken leg because
they did something dumb
right
it seems to me that a tremendous amount
of our entire health care budget is
correcting people's dumb ass choices in
life
so why would you why would you call this
one out to be special
it's not special at all
we're making a bad choice every time we
wake up
exercise today nah i'm busy
eat less
not today
right smoke less
okay um
provocatively
i asked this question
is it just a coincidence that everything
i
try to influence goes my way
is that just a coincidence probably not
a hundred percent
but have you ever noticed that
coincidence that whenever i'm
persuading on a particular topic
it seems to go my way
well today we learned that uh great
britain has decided that nuclear energy
will be the cornerstone of their plan to
get to zero carbon emissions
great britain is all in
on nuclear
power now um adam townsend had a uh
podcast i think it was yesterday
in which he had uh
an expert from uh oklaho i think oklo a
new generation nuclear startup
and asked this question on my behalf so
adam had solicited questions to ask
these experts and one of my questions
got asked
and it was if america can't get nuclear
if we can't get nuclear in america
how can we get it in space
now the expert explained that because
it's space
the type of energy you can use up there
is not
every kind of energy you couldn't burn
oil or
you can't use coal in space
you can't run an extension cord for
electricity so there's lots of things
you can't do to get energy in space but
the one thing you can do is nuclear
in fact we already do it
i think some satellites are nuclear
right
fact check me on that
um
and uh adam asks on my behalf can there
be a space force
without that
and uh the expert said basically you
need nuclear for space
now once you know that you need a
domestic nuclear program a good one a
robust nuclear program
because otherwise you give up space
it's over isn't it
the the question of whether america
needs to go hard into nuclear energy for
domestic use is completely answered
by just that one fact
if we give up space
that's the end that's basically putting
a timer on the united states to no
longer be an important power
you know it might be 50 years in the
future
but it definitely puts the timer on and
says okay if you're not going nuclear
you're not in space if you're not in
space you're not going to rule anything
on earth either you're done it's the end
of your republic
so i think this only could go one way
and also climate change etc
was screaming for an answer the answer
was already there it was nuclear just
people were not well informed
so when people like michael
schellenberger
testified to the american congress
and gave them information
for the first time a lot of them were
under-informed but once they were
informed
you saw that the united states congress
both parties are like yeah nuclear boom
so just being informed and brought up to
date on what the real risks are with the
newer technologies etc
was enough probably
so
uh shellenberger for the win but did you
know
that uh michael schellenberger also
did the same thing in great britain
also
brought his expertise to great britain
in 2019 and it was asked you know what
to do about climate change et cetera and
told them the same thing there is one
solution
it works
there's one solution nuclear there's not
a second solution
and now and now great britain also
now informed
yeah apocalypse nefer was uh
michael schellenberger's book that
talked about that
and now informed great britain's uh not
just
on board with nuclear but aggressively
aggressively on board
so i asked this question provocatively i
said
you know is it a coincidence that
everything i persuade on goes my
way
it's not because i caused it
it's because i could tell what which way
things are going to go
right
now i did of course try to influence as
much as possible
mark schneider was a big part of
informing me
so that i can form others and i don't
know if you know but a number of people
in congress follow me on twitter
did you know that
there are quite a few people in the news
business and in congress who followed me
on twitter and so i've been
you know informing basically use using
what i knew from mark schneider from
michael shellenberger to
[Music]
communicate the safety and the necessity
of nuclear and here we are but i don't
think it was my uh power of persuasion
that made the difference
i th uh obviously it was you know
schallenberger making a big difference
mark schneider i think made a big
difference
um but i think we were it was inevitable
i basically predicted something that
couldn't go any other way
there was only one way this could go it
was a matter of how much time
but as soon as people were brought up to
speed
information wise
there was only one way it was going to
go
so when i cheekily say is it a
coincidence that everything i
try to influence goes my way
it's not because i influenced it
necessarily maybe i did but not
necessarily it's because i'm good at
picking things that are going to go that
way anyway let me give you another
example one of my earliest uh efforts
for influence was getting
smoking out of public places and out of
out of offices and stuff so i put a lot
of work into that
but wasn't that going to go my way
anyway
i mean really
you know do you think that smoking was
always going to be allowed indoors
no no i just knew
it was obvious which way it was going to
go
i threw in on that direction
maybe i made some difference maybe not
but it was more like a prediction
and it's easy to predict the inevitable
likewise other
persuasion that i've been very involved
in
was the right to die to have a
doctor-assisted death
so in california that passed so that was
the law
and i persuaded very hard on that topic
but again wasn't it gonna go that way
anyway
really i feel like i just picked the
topic that was going in the right
direction
so
um
just keep that in mind but i like
putting that out there because it's
provocative
um
here's a question
all right i'm going to quiz you to see
your general knowledge of a very
important fact about covet
you ready uh if you get this fact right
if you get the right answer
then i would say that your opinion about
vaccinations
might be credible
because it means that you know more than
other people
all right so here's the test we're going
to see if you have if you know enough
to have a good opinion about
vaccinations
here's the question
do vaccinations cause
more variance
like the delta now the delta came before
the vaccinations but do the vaccinations
cause
more
or could they cause
more variance
look at the answers that are streaming
by on on each of your platforms we're
seeing a mixture of no's and yeses
do you see that the mixture is pretty
mixed
pretty mixed
seeing a lot of yeses but seeing a lot
of no's
now how could you have an opinion on
vaccinations
unless you know this
pretty important isn't it
all right how many of you have heard of
the
the chicken vaccinations
which there is a study that shows that
the vaccinations for the chickens
for some chicken disease
actually did
according to a study did increase the
variance how many of you are aware of
that study
are you aware of the study about the
chickens
and how their vaccinations increased
the number of variants
because that's what is always tweeted to
be when i bring up the topic
okay so if you're not on twitter maybe
you've never seen it but
let's just say there is a study
and the study says that where they
vaccinated the chickens it increased the
variance
so
let's say that was true
now it's just a study
you'd want to see some more studies and
etc but let's say it's true
let's say you believe it
does that if it's true does it tell you
something about the coronavirus vaccine
if it's true for chickens oh and i'll
add something i'm going to add something
the chicken vaccination
is also leaky
just like the coronavirus one leaky
meaning that even when you're vaccinated
um you can still get it
you just won't die
so they're both leaky
does the fact that you know the chicken
vex the vaccination let's say you do
know that cause more variance is that is
does that mean that you have the same
risk with the coronavirus
go let's see in the comments
uh this vaccine isn't as novel so you
can't compare that that is a correct
answer i'm looking for something else
but that is a good comment
yeah you can't compare
they're just different technologies etc
um
we're not comparing to natural immunity
now drop that topic for now
chickens are not humans of course but
remember we're talking about the logic
of it
we're only talking about the logic of it
is the logic that if your vaccine
stops most of the virus
that the only ones that can get out
are the are the bad ones the variants
that escape the vaccinations coverage
this paid comment says selecting for a
specific protein to target which is what
we do with chronovirus increases the
probability it could cause mutations i
haven't heard that before
but i don't know if that's true but add
that to your
questions
all right here's what i believed
was true
what i believed is that the more virus
the more variants
anybody
does anybody agree with me not the more
filters
but the more virus
to me if you had
a billion times more viruses they'd be
just naturally mutating all over the
place
and some of them would be stronger like
the delta and they would take over but
suppose only one person in the world was
ever infected
we'll just take the extreme only one
person in the world has ever been
infected
with that one person
create just as many variants
as if a billion people were infected
the answer is no
no a billion people infected create more
variants because there's more virus
right
so if your vaccine was not leaky
would you have a problem
nope
if your vaccine is not leaky you give
somebody the vaccination and they're
just out of the game
they're taken completely out of the game
because they won't get it
and they won't transmit it if it's not
leaky
but our vaccines are leaky
so in that case
do they cause more variance or fewer
well let me tell you about the chicken
vaccination
the the case of the chicken vaccination
does tell you something
i think
about the coronavirus vaccination
it does tell you something and it's
important
except that it tells you the opposite of
what you think
here's the problem with the chicken
virus it was completely different
opposite really from coronavirus what is
the thing everybody says about
coronavirus
dammit
it only kills
less than one percent of the people get
it and most of them are old
right so coronavirus is a virus that
kills
almost nobody
percentage-wise there's still a lot of
people number wise
the chicken virus
would have killed all the chickens
fairly quickly
so without a vaccine the chicken virus
basically just takes out the chicken
so they give the chicken a vaccine
but then i can still get the virus
and now the chicken that would have been
dead
and couldn't spread is a chicken that's
very much alive
and spreading like a
the study about the chickens
proves the opposite point
than the people who are sending it to me
think what they think is that it shows
that vaccinations
cause more variance
what it really shows is that if you have
more virus everywhere you get more
variants
because these vaccinated chickens are
just full of virus
almost as if they had not been
vaccinated in in the classic way
so keeping chickens alive so they can
spread virus like crazy causes more
variants
because there's more virus
because there's more virus
so the more virus
the more variance
it probably isn't because of the
vaccination now go to coronavirus
you get a vaccination for coronavirus is
it the vaccination that causes you to
live longer
no
the thing that caused you to live longer
is that the coronavirus doesn't kill you
in the first place
except less than one percent
so
where the chicken virus kept chickens
alive that would have otherwise not
spread because they would have been dead
the coronavirus doesn't keep anybody
alive
as a percentage
okay i shouldn't put that in a absolute
as a percentage of people with
coronavirus it's trivial
because the people who die are less than
one percent
does that make sense
that the coronavirus doesn't change the
number of people who
who have
virus accepted reduce it
because we know we do know that if you
get the vaccination
you'll be
spreading it for
less fewer days
so probably the vaccination creates the
coronavirus creates less infected people
whereas the chicken virus created more
infected chickens
literally the opposite right
so the chicken virus is opposite
of what you should learn
from coronavirus
just remember this
more virus means more variants
keeping chickens alive creates more
virus
keeping people alive doesn't change
anything because they were going to be
alive anyway
except for the less than one percent
how's my argument
now
remember i'm not a virologist most of
you knew that
most of you knew i'm not a virologist
but the person who first said this
is a virologist right so the opinion i'm
giving you
has no credibility because it's coming
from me
but now i'm going to drop the bomb on
you it came from somebody who actually
knows the field
i'm just repeating it
now i don't know what the general
consensus is but i know that one expert
said exactly what i just said
in a sense more virus means more
variance and that's the end of it more
virus is more variance period
so just look for wherever there's more
virus more variance
um
so the brett weinstein i'm saying this
in the comments is that the virus
forces uh
evolution
no it doesn't
it doesn't force evolution
the virus is is creating variants at
exactly the same rate no matter what
it doesn't force any evolution what it
does is let things escape
right it does let things escape
but
some things are going to escape anyway
so
uh
i think
so so let me just say this
uh brett
is also highly educated
and i think in even in the correct
fields uh largely speaking
um
luke says now scott knows more about
biology than the brad weinstein signed
who's biology expert
no
i'm just telling you that somebody who
does have the right expertise disagrees
with him and i'm repeating that argument
now
what credibility should you put on
my discussion
of the variance
low
low you shouldn't put too much
credibility in what i said but i am i am
trying to present the argument in a way
that at least you can figure out what's
wrong with it
right so all i've added to it is the
notion that more virus equals more
variance with no exception
and that's that's something you can fact
check so now ask your experts
is that right more more virus just
always means more in fact more variants
so just boil it down to that
and and let's get a fact check because
could brett uh weinstein be right
that the vaccinations are
somehow promoting or causing variance he
could be
definitely could be
i wouldn't know but now you have a
question
does more variants more virus cause more
variants or does more
or does more blocking
cause more variance
good question
all right
uh mauritius says
fax framing and resistance uh
okay
i i read your comment but i don't want
to
mention that one out loud
all right
um
that
is pretty much
what i wanted to tell you today
um
letter to god please give scott a jordan
peterson intervention and save boo
why does jordan peterson need an
intervention
what's the difference between
observation and empirical evidence
well i think
level of rigor
you know empirical evidence suggests
that you
tried to collect it in an
organized fashion
whereas anecdotal just means you sort of
ran into it
well i don't know that jordan peterson
needs any interventions he's
he seems to be
you know i mean
he has some medical problems but i can't
help on that
ah itty bitty thank you for that
oh you liked my assist story yesterday
that's strange
um
what's this uh
patrick kerry says bret agrees with your
statement
uh you mean the statement that more
virus means more variance is that right
so yeah i guess i guess i guess i should
have been more careful with my
uh response to that i don't know exactly
what
brett's opinion is on this so i
shouldn't try to characterize it and
then talk about it if i if i haven't
seen the details
so just assume that everything i said
about that is low credibility
uh why are we vertical today because
so there's a weird
locals
i guess a bug or maybe a design flaw
it would be hard to explain
why
but it has to do with the fact that the
only way i can see the comments and also
have you in the right orientation is to
have two screens
the only way i can see the comments is
if i tweet
and then i go to twitter and open it and
then it takes me to the right place
otherwise i can't find it
i mean i could but i don't want to do it
live while you're waiting
and
so it's just an interface oddity that
makes it difficult if you're pressed for
time
um
yeah the number of variants doesn't
matter it just matters if you get a bad
one right
please read steve kirsh's analysis on
the vaccines for balanced analysis
mine's pretty balanced
do you think that my
my take on the vaccines is not balanced
the reason you hate me well those who do
is because it's balanced
i don't think anybody has more balanced
opinion than i do do they
somebody says i'm not balanced
what would be an example of that
not being balanced on the vaccination
be more specific i'm open to that being
true by the way i'm not denying it
i'm asking for a specific so i can see
if i can agree with you
because i because i'm trying to be
balanced
uh it seems to lean toward provax for
sure
let me push back on that so i think
that's where this is coming from people
think that i
i speak more about things that are pro
vacs how many of you would would agree
with that i think i would agree with it
too do most of you see that
that i say more things that are provacs
by their nature
than anti-vaxx
right
i agree with that too
that so that would be an observation
that i think is just objectively true
does that mean that i'm unbalanced
is it does it mean that i'm unbalanced
if i talk more about one side
is that how that works
is it by how much time you spend
because that does matter if you spend
more time on something people do get the
feeling
that that that means more to you
well what if what if the information is
biased in one direction
at least the official information is
biased in one direction if if i talked
about every claim
on the internet that is not accepted by
general science then there would be
maybe even more content anti-vaxx would
you agree with that
if i if i addressed every claim
that's this anti-vaxx
i would be talking more about anti-vac
stuff than provac stuff do you think
because there are a lot of claims
on twitter that are anti-vaxx
now what is the reason that i don't talk
about them
what what what is it
about my approach
that causes me to talk less
about the many many claims
of
vaccination somebody says lack of
knowledge
i would argue that i see all of that
because people want to send it to me
people are trying to change my mind or
at least my approach
and people are sending me the anti-vac
stuff just all day long
i've seen it i've seen a lot of it
so i think i think i'm well informed
about what the anti-vax people are
saying
why do you think that i don't talk about
as much
how deep do you read it
fairly deep
i mean as deep as i read other stuff i
don't i don't think i skim it more than
i skim anything else
yeah don't bring an allergy in yet
because that just gets us off track
um
explain the agreement for ade why don't
you ade is what
define ade
can somebody define ade for me what is
that
uh the intervention is for you
all right um scott people hear you say
you don't want to persuade them to take
the shot but
still you word things the way that feels
to them you actually are how could i
avoid that
how could i avoid
wording it in a way that you think i'm
talking you into it if
the data leads that way
should i should i not lean the same
direction as the
official data
would it be
anti-dependent enhancement
anti-body dependent enhancements
meaning what
i mean i know what the words mean
but why
why should i be talking about that
so
yeah so the thing that eileen thank you
exactly
i tried to lean toward credibility
meaning that
the official
the official responses
as wrong as they've been
the the official science about code as
wrong as it's been
it tends to have higher credibility
you know until they change the minds
then things that you hear about in a
um in some twitter
link to an article that never gets any
traction so i wait for the scientists to
tell me which of the other things i
should pay attention to
and
um you give too little weight to fairs i
do give i give um
wait were you here
so somebody said i give too little
weight to verse
if you if you watch this entire live
stream do you say that's true or false
i give too little
weight to fairs now vera's is where uh
reports of bad outcomes are
i just had a whole discussion where i
said i agree with you that the number of
reports of bad outcomes
is alarming and conflicts it conflicts
with and actually hurts the credibility
of the scientific opinion
i said that as clearly and directly as
you could possibly say it and the vares
database is just the
uh the obvious example of those reports
but it doesn't have to be embarrassed
because i asked on twitter and tons of
people say yeah i got a friend i get a
friend and they get a friend
scott would you call joe rogan for a
chat i don't think he and i
are the right ones for that chat
oh but let me let me let me say this i
don't know how often
joe rogan has multiple guests
for like a panel discussion i don't
think he does that model but if he did
there are better people than me to put
on it
i don't think i'm the right person for
that
it would be entertaining but it wouldn't
it wouldn't be as useful as you want it
to be
um so he says i got vaccine because of
scott's discussion and by doctor's
advice well i hope your doctor's advice
was a little bit
a little bit weighted more than mine
well i've been on i've been on joe
rogan's program so if you google it you
can find it
he does have multiples on but not
multiples who are on different sides
right
has joe ever had
people who are on different sides of a
debate on this at the same time
i'm saying yes
i don't think i've ever seen one oh he
has a few times
that would be the perfect
situation
although he's on spotify so he's he's
behind the paywall it'd be better not to
be behind a paywall
yeah a tim pool
would be sort of a good choice for that
i think i'd be a good choice but i don't
have the wherewithal to set it up
i mean
i do have to wear with all but i don't
have the time and interest right now um
spotify is free
why are you saying spotify is free are
you saying that his program on spotify
is free that's not true is it
wait am i missing something important
it's not a paywall
oh it's just ads uh really
i don't know that i don't use spotify so
spotify is not a subscription service
it's just got ads
that's the reason i didn't have spotify
maybe i should get it
all right well thank you see this is
that this is that example again of a new
kind of intelligence
in real time
you watched my mind be changed
and you saw it a few times
it's kind of cool isn't it
that that we we are collectively like a
a single
single rational entity it just takes all
of you to correct me on a regular basis
to get there
um
body autonomy
what about it
i don't know
uh so didn't watch the episode with dr
gupta complete i did not no
um
all right uh so there's no ads if you
have a subscription on spotify okay that
makes sense
um
alex says
god can you imagine being married to
this guy i assume you're talking about
me right
well
i'm not sure i understand
that was my phone
my phone just said i'm not sure i
understand
well i do understand somebody said
imagine being married to that guy you're
not wrong
imagine being married to me it's no
picnic believe me
um so you're right about that
would i host uh brett weinstein uh
versus andres beckhaus
uh no
i would not host them if just the two of
them no because that's not the right two
the the ones you want are uh
because both of them are kind of critic
both of them are skeptics i would say
skeptic of different things
but i want somebody who's a believer and
at least one skeptic and then somebody
who can do some fact checking
so you you want three people
one of them just a fact checker
and the other two being on on other
sides of the issue
so that would be the ideal model and
then maybe a
one moderator so you need four people
moderator plus those three
three plus i was good yeah
actually let's make that a thing
you want to make that a thing
you want to do a little uh let's do a
little uh persuasion
experiment
whoever just said let me call you out
twix bar so user twix bar over on the
locals platform
just
just has a comment that says three plus
host
and i like that branding
so let's see if we can make
three plus host
a model
that people understand as the best model
now of course the news will often
violate that model but let's see if we
can get somebody to do it
three plus one the the plus one is the
host
and the three are people on two sides of
an issue and then a fact checker who
doesn't seem to be associated with
either of them
and then a host
who can keep it all straight
and oh and then here's the the last part
last part is not a timed event
or if it's timed it's a lot of time
right it could be three hours but you
don't want to have five minute hit
right it can't be it can't just be
you know something that it's an episode
on uh hannity or something
you know it's it's got to be his own
show it can't be an episode on somebody
else's show wouldn't have enough time so
let's see if we can make that happen
three plus one
is the model three plus host and it will
be one fact checker two people on
opposite sides and the host the host
does a good job of moderating and making
sure the fact checker gets in there
what do you say let's make it a thing
let's see if somebody can do one of them
and then
no matter how it works then we refine
the model maybe the first one isn't so
good but you just refine the model based
on what you learn
oh uh ben shapiro would be
yeah there's lots of people you could
think of who have the platform
so here's the first thing we need we
need the platform and the host
right getting the guess i think would be
the easy part
ooh dave reuben
dave rubin
i think he has all the technical
wherewithal which is what you need
because you need the three screens and
and the you know the organization of it
all that's the stuff i can't i don't
have the time to do
but dave rubin
wouldn't you watch uh
dave rubin now
i would make
with all
with all respect to dave rubin who by
the way by the way dave rubin is one of
my examples of the talent stack guy
he's got like a whole bunch of talents
that just work together perfectly i mean
his career is a
um
he's a role model in terms of how to
make something work i mean he really
does a great job of
combining talents to make something
special
but
part of his talent stack is that
he's agreeable and people like him i
don't know i think you need somebody
who's a little bit more of a bastard for
the pushback
all right a little bit more of a bastard
i don't know if he could go full bastard
because you're gonna need to shut down
both of the experts but at different
times
and maybe even the fact checker so
you're going to have to have a strong
like a dictator's hand
to say whoa whoa that didn't make any
sense
right
now
uh i worry that dave is too nice
because he usually does interviews in
which there's not a lot of conflict
but maybe maybe i mean if if he wanted
to do it he'd be a great platform for it
because he's got a big platform
so dave if you're listening to this and
somebody will probably tell you if
you're not listening
[Laughter]
that's a challenge to you
if you could put this together and
uh and be
tough on them
or ultimately get somebody who would be
so may you know just because you're the
the host doesn't mean you have to be the
moderator
so the three plus one doesn't have to be
the host
the host could just introduce it and say
here you go
you know it's my program but
you know take it away
so that could work
that could work but i think dave could
do it i just don't know if he wants to
be the one
to be that much of a bastard you need a
bastard
like i'd be good at it because i'm a
bastard
michael malus
cernovich would be good
cernovich could do it
uh maybe corolla see the problem is
you've got to find somebody who's also
well informed
so being a bastard isn't enough
you need to also be well informed
dvorak
crowder
guffeld
mark um oh there you go mark levin
okay
there's one so let's just take that as
our example mark levin is he well
informed yeah
yeah is he a good communicator yes big
platform yes
could he be a bastard
yes
i mean that in a complimentary way yeah
you could totally be a bastard about it
somebody said bill maher
i accept that
bill maher can be a bastard
again in the best way you know you just
have to be a bastard sometimes and
shut people down and challenge them
uh too polarizing somebody says maybe
i'm probably too polarizing too
uh
you do it from reuben's studio i would
do that
i would do that if you wanted to
um i don't know it needs to be in the
studio but
you need the resources
um
all right sam harris
good good suggestion sam harris actually
that's my dream team right there
my dream team would be
not even me doing it my dream team would
be
sam harris doing it
that'd be pretty good
because i think sarah maris has the
intellectual weight
as well as the ability
to
change his mind
which is rare
so i think he could do it he'd be good
at that i don't know if he could be
enough of a bastard
probably
i know what do you think could sam
harris be enough of a bastard
to make that work
uh you probably need somebody who well
let me revise that i think sam
for all of his strengths uh his
sort of intellectual approach to things
might not fit the bastard host model as
closely as possible
you need a bastard host all right i've
talked too long i gotta go
and i will talk to you all
later
