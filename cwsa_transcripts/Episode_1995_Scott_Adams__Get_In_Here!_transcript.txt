almost instantly all right so the uh the
Youtube feed looks like it's
working
but uh
come on in here get in here come on
a little technical difficulty but you
have arrived at the highlight of
civilization and you've arrived in time
for the simultaneous Sip and if you're
late for it you probably want it to be
but all you need is a cupboard glass
attacker Chelsea Steiner canteen drug a
flaska vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines the other day
thing makes everything better it's
called this simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
foreign
yeah I hope
I hope those I hope people are not stuck
on some broken live stream I hope the
old one broke
I just love it when
YouTube dies just before I need it now
this was going to be the most important
live stream I ever did
in all likelihood this would have been
the highest rated live stream I've ever
done
because I know the content but you don't
and of course the technology doesn't
work on this one this could have been
like a a life-changing
you know live stream uh it didn't work
Changed History probably it could have
changed the history of the actually
changed this the direction of my whole
life possibly
all right let's go private over here on
on the locals
platform you're private thanks for
remember reminding me all right I think
enough oh here we go looks like
everybody's back in
let's do this
um number one would you like some good
news anybody want some good news
there's some really good news like
really really good news
CNN reports that viruses are down
everywhere the covid-19 the RSV the flu
basically all of them are starting to
dive and it's winter
what's going on
I don't know why I'm not sure if it's
going to last but
I have a theory
and the theory the mass work
shut up
I just have to tell you somebody over on
YouTube just says Ah masks work I assume
that was a joke but it was a good one
shut up
that's funny okay you got me out of that
one
but is it possible that through all of
this Badness and the the coven and
everything is it possible that we've
just
supersized our immune systems
like I don't I can't think of any reason
that that all of the viruses would be
down
at the same time in the middle of the
winter
they should be Sky High right
this should be the peak and it's going
down
so
it could be that
uh
yeah actually the only thing that's
going down is the hospitalizations so it
could be that maybe Something's Happened
maybe our immune system's got
maybe ramped up a little bit I don't
know or it could be that people are just
not going to the hospital
yeah they have natural immunity right so
there may be so many people have been
infected with something that's close
enough to something else
because I can't think of any other
reason right is there any other
hypothesis
why all the viruses would go down at the
same time in the middle of the winter
there's no other hypothesis right it's
it's
oh warmer no
the week people died off
that could be
could be that the people were going to
die already died anyway I'm going to
tell you this good news
um One update on the fascinating story
of Stephen Crowder versus The Daily wire
and remember he was offered a big deal a
lot of money and he said it's not about
the money
blah blah blah it's about you know
whether he would be able to do what he
wants to do and not be penalized in
terms of censorship or losing money and
stuff now
uh
I made my criticisms about a recorded
phone call and and went over the deal
but there's one part I left out
that
or will remind me did I leave this out
that it looked to me at the time and I
didn't mention that I don't think but uh
Candace Owens did that he's probably
looking to just start his own thing
and so one way to get a lot of attention
for starting your own thing is to you
know make a big deal and torch the
people who were trying to hire you now
doing his own thing makes sense and and
I heard from Candace Owens on video
that he encountered or he'd asked for
120 million
now what does that sound like
what's the first thing you think of and
I don't have confirmation of that that's
just something I heard on Candace's show
what does it tell you that if the if the
number was 120 what would that tell you
yeah oh there we go Joe Rogan it looks
like he was trying to get a bigger
payday than Joe Rogan
doesn't it
and that that was the play play was to
try to Joe Rogan size himself
because you can get a lot of attention
by going doing his own thing and maybe
that's the only way he can say what he
wants to say without getting censored
so yeah oh yeah and the the dollar
amounts were spread over X number of
years that's right
so it sounds to me like it was probably
uh uh a play where one of two things
would happen
either the daily wire
the daily wire would either up their
offer or modify their offer or
or you'd start his own thing and at the
size that the scale and size he's
operating at the starting his own thing
makes sense
doesn't it
I feel like it probably makes sense
but we'll see
um
so the story on CNN about the Wagner
group I call them Wagner but if you want
to be really Russian sounding let's call
them Wagner
because they sound more dangerous that
way
oh whose Army is coming after us the
Wagners
it reminds me of a dog waggiest day the
Wagner's the Wagners aren't going to
hurt us they're just gonna be wagging
but what if I told you
the Wagner's were after you
oh no not the Wagner's the Wagner's are
coming now that's dangerous happening so
I'm going to call it Wagner's from now
on that's what CNN does
but I guess the story is that the Wagner
group is getting all the good weapons
and they're the only ones that are
making any progress in terms of taking
over territory in Ukraine
and
what's interesting is the head of the
Wagner group is just saying it directly
are you saying that only the Wagner
group is doing anything in the Russian
army is kind of useless
and he's able to say that out loud
because apparently either either Putin
is losing control over him because he's
the only one
because he's the only one you know is
getting any progress or the Wagner group
might be getting ready to take over
Russia is that even a possibility
it doesn't seem like it would be I feel
like there'd be enough firewalls there
to keep the Wagner group from taking
over the Kremlin
but they might be the only the only
operating military in a year
like it's possible that the vaginal
group is all this left that's you know
functioning in a good way so it makes
you wonder if the Wagner group could
take over the country
so that would be the the scariest
situation probably even scarier than
Putin well we'll watch that how many of
you saw Tucker Carlson
talking about the history of the CIA
running the country
from the Kennedy assassination through
today
does anybody see that
it might be one of the greatest things
I've ever seen on television in all
genres
like that's a pretty big claim isn't it
the greatest thing I've ever seen on
television in any genre Sports
news
natural disasters anything moon landing
yeah now I don't know if it's true
or let's say I I think I think we know
that the facts he gave her true that
they seem well demonstrated in history
but I don't know if the interpretation
is right on but if you if you missed it
I'll try as best I can to give you the
summary
but you really have to see it in context
it honestly is one of the greatest
things I've ever seen on television
yeah maybe I oversold it but definitely
listen to it so here's the basic idea
we know from audio tapes as Tucker
explained that Richard Nixon believed he
knew who killed John Kennedy because he
said so to the head of the CIA
on tape that we have
and the head of the CIA answered with
no answer whatsoever
so that's on audio
so soon after Nixon said he thought he
knew who killed John as he called it
Kennedy
um
the the Watergate thing happened now
here's some contexts that I was not
aware of
that Tucker filled in did you know that
Richard Nixon was the most popular
president of all time
according to the margin of his win for
his second term if you look at how how
much he won his second turn by nobody's
ever been close he's actually the most
popular president
in the history of the United States
did you have any idea
I had no idea I would I would have
thought he was closer to the bottom but
only because I was brainwashed right I
was a very young man when the Watergate
stuff was happening so I just accepted
what the news told me
I was totally brainwashed into thinking
Nixon was a monster
do you know what else Nixon did
he ended the war in Vietnam
do you know what else he did
he made friends with China
who would not want those things to
happen
the people who sell weapons
for one so
so then the Watergate thing happens
which brought down Nixon did you know
that the uh
the four members of the Watergate
break-in were xcia people
did you know that
the very group that we suspect or or it
looks like may have brought Nixon down
huh that's interesting
how about
um
did you know that when Nixon you know
the Watergate thing happened he was
removed from office he was replaced not
by his vice president because the vice
president had already been taken out
Spiro Agnew
but rather he was replaced by Gerald
Ford
and Gerald Ford
was next CIA guy
who also
was the head of the Warren Commission
that interestingly said it was just one
shooter and nobody else was involved
so the xcia guy
who only was in the vice presidency
because the Deep State already took out
the vice president
and then they took out the president and
they installed the guy that they had
installed at the head of the Warren
Commission to say that nothing had
happened to John Kennedy that was
strange and then that guy that guy
became president
that guy
I didn't know this like well I knew like
a lot of the parts but I hadn't
connected them
so then Nixon gets taken out
by the Watergate thing which was a bunch
of CIA people
and
then the Washington Post
writes about the story you know big
breaking story and uh it was Woodward
and Bernstein
Woodward was uh was he somebody who came
up through the journalism
uh let's say path no he was an Intel guy
Woodward was an Intel guy who somehow
got one of the biggest jobs in
journalism at one of the biggest Outlets
without experience and then suddenly he
got all the scoop on Watergate from
somebody in the Intel Community he used
to work for
is any of this sounding a little shady
so it looks like maybe the Washington
Post and Woodward and Bernstein were
were in on it it looks like Gerald Ford
was in on it it looks like the CIA has
been running things or the you know
Intel or deep state or whatever has been
running things since the days of Kennedy
or before and all of it's just
all of it is just uh orchestrated
see Roger Stone somebody says
okay
um
now what else
and then here's the question I asked
myself well how do you explain Ronald
Reagan
does anybody think Ronald Reagan was a
CIA deep State person
there's no there's no suggestion of that
right and and here's the thing you have
to ask yourself
so we get somebody who's not a deep
State person and somebody tries to
assassinate them
reggae got shot
he lived
but it was Reagan like the exception
that proves the rule
that he was so popular he could get
elected anyway you know even if there's
some
you know movement against him
but then he does get elected he gets
shot
like Kennedy
didn't matter if he was Republican
or like Kennedy a Democrat
if you're if you're somebody who is not
already deep State you get assassinated
or they or they try
then who who replaced Reagan do you
remember
do you remember who replaced Reagan
yeah Bush Senior
out of the CIA
coincidence that of the CIA
now
what about uh Clinton
have any CIA connection
well they the Clinton seems to have some
deep State connection I don't I don't
know what else I have
how about Obama
does Obama have any uh CIA connections
deep state
oh I think you're going to find out
something about Obama
I I might know more than you on this
topic but you might have some might have
some surprises in the future might have
some surprises
all right
um
so then what about Trump
was Trump a deep State CIA guy
nope
did the Deep State and the CIA take
Trump out
yes they did right in front of you
yes they did
you know when when you see the whole
history of it
as Tucker points out brilliantly
you can't miss it
you can't miss it
it's right in front of you
it's really incredible
I don't you know my entire history is
fake like everything I knew about the
United States is all made up it's all
fake every bit of it
oh well
and and you know the reason that I can
say this in public without any risk
whatsoever do you know why I can say
this in public without risk
because they're so they're so firmly in
control that I'm irrelevant
like it's not going to change anything
that I said and they don't have to worry
about me I have no there's no risk to
the system whatsoever at all
all right now
let's let's solve some more Mysteries
you want to solve another mystery
why why is the government not working on
Tick Tock to ban it and Sentinel to do
something serious about it
only one reason
only one reason yeah somebody in
intelligence doesn't want it to happen
for whatever reason don't know the
reason but you can know who it is
we definitely know who it is we just
don't know why
right
can't we guarantee at this point that
the politicians are not in charge
which would explain everything
right and it would explain everything if
the politicians are generally not in
charge it's just the Deep State telling
people what to do and then they act like
they're in charge
that's the only way I can explain it I
can't explain it any other way
somebody says defund the CIA
who do you think is in charge of funding
that's asking list the CIA to defund
themselves they're already in charge or
you know some permanent members are in
charge not necessarily just CIA but I'm
sure they're part of the larger story
all right there's uh more information
about the lab League Theory and the
fauci files
and now we know that behind the scenes
that the experts were saying they it
looked like there was a good chance it
was a lab leak
but publicly the government was saying
oh it's not a lab leak no no came from
some kind of a bat or a penguin or
something but apparently behind the
scenes the experts were not saying that
they did however
seemed to drift in that direction over
time
but the question is why was our
government lying to us
when it was a very real possibility in
the experts Minds you know it was like a
50 50 60 40 situation whether it was
natural or lab related
and
the do you agree with
the government lying to you
in that context
do you think the government should have
been honest and say you know honestly we
can't tell if it's a lab leak or not and
our experts are sort of up in the air on
it
yeah I I was listening to a spaces
yesterday and I heard a Counterpoint to
that your first instinct is right right
your first instinct is of course they
should tell you of course they should
but then the Counterpoint is this
it's War
right the pandemic looked like war and
we didn't know who we were fighting we
didn't know if somebody had
intentionally let out a virus we didn't
know if Panic was going to be a bigger
problem than the virus itself everything
was unknown
so under those conditions where the
stakes are really the fate of the whole
country
and it's all unknown
and your government decides to lie to
you for your own benefit
is it unethical
they're doing it for your benefit
literally for your benefit
is that unethical
yeah probably probably
you know but but I will tell you that in
general
if somebody's on my team and they lie to
me for my own benefit I'm going to treat
that with
you let's say more empathy than if
somebody was just trying to screw me for
their benefit if you're screwing me for
your benefit then you must die
if you're lying to me for my benefit and
you've got a good argument
even if you're wrong
you had a good argument at the time and
you had my back
I'm not I'm not going to be as hardcore
on that but you can be you can be I
wouldn't I wouldn't criticize you for
being a maniac on that it just that's
that's where I that's sort of my current
uncomfortable stance on it all right
um how many of you are aware that Dana
White who was caught on video slapping
his wife after his wife slapped him
first in Cabo
coincidentally was launching a new show
on TBS called powerslap in which people
stand there and slap each other in the
face
until one can't take it anymore
now is that a total coincidence
well it doesn't seem like a coincidence
right like that that I don't know how
many minutes of Dana White's entire life
are caught on somebody's camera phone
camera phone on their phone but uh it
was kind of a big coincidence that just
before he launches a major show
about people slapping each other
that just before that he gets caught on
camera
slapping his wife who slapped him first
but neither of them got hurt and neither
of them complained huh
now there are two ways to say it's not a
coincidence number one
it was a clever plan for marketing
does anybody think that's possible do
you think it was all a setup and it was
just marketing
I would say that's very possible
it's not my it's not my first
conspiracy theory Choice I've got a
second theory
that's sort of in between
it goes like this
for If he if he's launching this new
this whole new business what do you
think he was doing every day
probably every day he was talking about
the word slap
as you know it's like slap this slap
that and they was looking at videos of
people slapping he was probably looking
at some you know test competitions to
see how it would work out it's probably
all day long this guy was around people
slapping people in their face
then when he comes home what does he
talk about with his wife
oh these people are slapping each other
I got a slap thing I'll call it a slap
fight slap power power slap it's going
to be slap slap slap slap slap
right so he and his wife are talking
about people slapping each other
and not dying
because in theory they're all supposed
to survive right it's just hahaha we
slapped each other and and the context
is these people are really big and
slapping the hell out of each other
as opposed to what the couple did which
was sort of got each other's attention
nobody was hurt
so
I think that the priming is what was the
problem
that's just a guess right we can't know
what was in their heads we can't know
what really happened but my best theory
is if all day long you're talking about
people slapping each other and then you
get drunk
and your your wife slaps you because she
knows it's not going to hurt you
and all day long you're talking about
people slapping each other and you get
slapped and you slap back
I think that's what happened
the fact that it was on a camera is
probably just because he's famous right
so people probably always take his
picture if they recognize him
it's probably pretty common
so
that's my theory what what do you think
do you think that the excessive priming
about slapping
just bled into his normal let's say his
reflex drunken decision
that's what it looks like
now also you have to know that for him
to launch a slap Network what must he
have done in his mind
in his mind he must have talked himself
out of it being dangerous
you know or at least too dangerous
obviously there's some Danger
but he must have talked himself out of
it being dangerous
so that when he did it he was already in
the frame of well a slap isn't going to
kill you it's literally entertainment
he made slapping entertainment
that's probably how we thought of it and
he didn't hurt his wife so that's
important
all right
um if you've seen the uh the
advertisements were in the video
I'm just going to say it directly
I'm not a doctor
but it looks like a brain damage
competition
because the people get slapped at least
you know in the previous
they look like they have brain damage to
me they're actually wandering around
they don't even know where they are they
can't even stand up they don't have
their balance
and they don't even
you know they don't they actually like
they're not even conscious for a little
while
you know that uh concussion is brain
damage right
like it's brain damage that's what a
concussion is now I don't know if
they're getting concussions but I know
they act like it so in my non-medical
opinion it's a show about
people who are giving each other brain
damage
and
I'd love to tell you therefore I'm not
going to watch it
but honestly
watching stupid people slap the out
of each other
is way more entertaining than it should
be
like I'm not proud of this moment
and I'm going to be less proud in a
moment
by the way does anybody want to hear me
say that the anti-vaxxers were totally
right
hold on for that hold on for that
because it's coming
now
all right well good I gave you a little
thrill it's going to get better in a
moment I got double whiteboards double
whiteboards that's how right you are
all right
but anyway power slap is interesting
have I ever mentioned that I end up in
the middle of of national stories way
too often and it happened again
yesterday I don't know if you caught
this one yet but it starts with uh Elon
Musk tweeted
that his cousin who is Young and in Peak
Health had a serious case of myocarditis
after the shot and went to the hospital
but he said that after he'd said that he
himself Elon Musk had major side effects
for my second booster shot felt like I
was dying for several days hopefully no
permanent damage but I don't know
now
this is a a headline story on Fox News
you know just a few hours after he
tweeted it
here's how I ended up in this story
he was responding to my tweet
so somehow in the middle of this story
like like I I I wasn't talking to him I
was just tweeting about something and
then he responded to it and then it's a
national story so somehow
like this is what makes me feel like I'm
living in a simulation
because
it's just too weird how often I get in
the middle of a story it can't it's hard
to describe
in you know it's hard to understand in
any normal way
but
um here's the fascinating part from this
and and so that you will all stay with
me
here's what's going to happen
I'm going to tell you that the people
who the anti-vaxxers appear to be right
but then I'm going to talk about some
why right I'm gonna I'm gonna give you
some details why usually you most of you
disappear when I talk about anything
facts related but I'm only going to talk
about how we analyze it
but having I'm going to start with an
admission okay
just so you'll stay around
at the moment
and anything could change
but at the moment the anti-vaxxers
appear to be the ones who were the most
right
and the ones who are the biggest winners
did I say that directly enough
now do you accept that as a direct
statement
right
are you okay with that
that at the moment with what we know
right now
it would look like the people who didn't
get vaccinated
are the lucky ones or the right choice
I could be one or the other but wouldn't
you say that they if so here's their
situation let's compare it
uh I got vaccinated
you know reluctantly and I waited as
long as possible and
blah blah but
uh so I had no bad outcomes I got a
little bit of you know Omicron
few days of discomfort no big deal so
now I have I have natural immunity
from the Omicron
but I also have this you know let's say
not perfectly understood
vaccination thing inside me forever
so how happy am I
that were sort of on the other side of
the pandemic I would say
but I have this extra like nagging thing
in my body
am I happy
well I'm not unhappy but I could be a
lot happier right my perfect situation
would be natural immunity
and no vaccination in my body
so I don't I that's not the best
situation for me right
best situation
would be somebody who did not get
vaccinated
got a little Omicron
or maybe even a worse one but recovered
now you've got natural immunity
and you have no vaccination in you
can we all agree that that was the
winning path
everybody
is there anybody would disagree with
that
that based on what we know today which
could change
you know I'm going to stay open to
reversing this decision if anything
changes
but at the moment every day we get more
bad news about the vaccinations of the
shots
um
and but we don't get better information
right every day is just negative
the
the big one of the biggest wild cards
was this long coveted
and
anecdotally it looks like the
vaccination
side effects appear to be bigger than
the long covet now I don't know that to
be true
and if I learn later that it's not true
I might reverse my decision but at the
moment just anecdotally
I'm not hearing tons of people saying I
had bad covert experience that's
lingering they do exist Dr Drew being
you know a notable person with that case
I think
did Dr Malone say he had some long
covered I can't remember I think he did
so there are some notable we know that
both exist you know there is something
that people identify as long covet and
there are things that people identify
correctly or not as vax injury
but it does seem like the vaccination we
hear more about
than the long covet
so you know so that looks like a win now
here is the most interesting part to me
right
um and first of all is everybody
accepting
that that's where the data is at the
moment
that the smartest happiest people are
the ones who didn't get the vaccination
and are still alive
now there is a category of people
that according to mainstream medicine
are only alive because they got the
vaccination do you believe that that's a
true thing
do you believe that
the medical professionals oh you don't
okay but I'll just say that they believe
it right the medical professionals still
say
that you know millions of lives were
saved of the older people
but at the cost of maybe lives of the
younger people
and maybe at a cost of you know longer
term damage that we can't predict
now I'm only saying that's what the
experts say I'm not saying that you
agree with it would you agree that the
experts still say
mostly experts still say
that the vaccination probably saved
millions of lives but we don't know any
long-term damage
and it definitely killed some people too
definitely killed some people all right
so uh we allow that you disagree with
the experts that's that's where the bulk
of experts are at the moment
um so if I compare myself to an
anti-vaxxer today
I would say the anti-vaxxers have a
right to be happier than I do
I want to make sure
that I'm not leaving any wiggle room for
myself
have I
have I said as clearly as possible
they're the happy ones right now
and have a reason to be completely
right
um
but here's the fascinating Parts
somebody asked let's see it was uh
Elijah Schaefer
who who yeah who was
he says I'm still intrigued by how many
intelligent people got duped into taking
these he was responding to Elon Musk uh
are you can are you uh intrigued about
that or curious why did so many smart
people
take the vaccinations
and let me list some people who got
vaccinated
Dr Robert Malone got vaccinated
and he was one of the inventors of the
technology
now he's of course not getting boosted
because information has come out that's
you know makes that look like a a
sketchy decision for most people
um
so Elon Musk who most people consider
one of the smartest analytical
people in the world
he got asked
Dr Malone
who invented it got waxed
the executives of Pfizer
who should have known the most about his
safety
they took it
they ate their own dog food all of them
the the scientists who invented it
all took it now I go okay okay so the uh
I accept
that you you don't know if they took it
okay let me just do a little carve out
here we all accept
that we don't know for sure who took
what right
you don't know if we found out later
that the Pfizer Executives just said
they took it and didn't
well we get a big problem
that would be death sentence
do you agree if you ever found out that
the Pfizer Executives only lied and
didn't take their own vaccination that
should be a death sentence
death sentence and in fact if the legal
system can't kill them the public should
hunt them down
no just kidding you can't say that on
social media nobody should be killing
anybody don't do any violence
but it would happen right
it would happen
like they'd be hunted down and I think
the public would actually tear them up
to pieces now I don't I think they took
the Jabs
if I had to bet on it about all of the
executives took it
but if I had to bet on it I would not
bet that all of their scientists took it
would you take that back
there's no way we'll ever settle the bet
but I'll bet that all of the executives
took it because you know they had the
executive pressure on them
but the scientists
I don't know
maybe not
I'll bet not all of the scientists took
it I'm that's just a guess it's just a
hunch
can't prove it it'll never be proved but
I wouldn't be surprised if all the
executives took it would you
executives are just sheep right
so basically if the CEO CEO took it and
maybe he had to for you know his risk
reward to make his billions of dollars
it was a good risk but if the CEO took
it you're pretty much your ass is going
to have fired if you don't take it so I
think the executives probably took
how about our government
how about the members of the CDC
do you think the members of the CDC who
had maybe more information than we did
do you think that they all got jabbed
I'll bet they did
now I'll bet they did the same reason as
the executives
did fauci get fully vaxxed and boosted
I'll bet he did
do you think fauci himself didn't take
the vaccination
the shop
and and why would he take it if he knows
so much and he knows it's dangerous why
would the Pfizer people take it if they
know so much
well let me give you an answer
the Pfizer people and fauci don't have
the same calculation that you and I do
because they get rich
if they're right
so even if they think the vaccination is
dangerous let's say you came to me and
said you said Scott
uh there's an incredibly High 10 chance
this shot will kill you
there's a nine and a ten percent chance
that if you take the shot and convince
other people to take it you will make 10
billion dollars
and really quickly
would I take the shot if there was a 10
chance it would hurt me and that 90
chance I'd make billions of dollars
I don't know at 10 maybe I wouldn't take
the chance
but let's say you said it's two percent
if it were two percent it the the
vaccination would be like you know
mowing down people like crazy because
two percent of a billion or whatever
however many get vaccinated is a big big
number
but I'd take a 98 chance of dying for a
billion dollars
would you
I would
so fauci and the executives of Pfizer it
does make sense for them to get
vaccinated if there's only a two percent
chance they're going to drop dead from
it
I'm not saying there is a two percent
chance I don't know what it is but it's
not 10 percent
probably
there's some news out now that the CDC
knew that like close to 80 of people
were having terrible side effects that
were permanent or something
I don't believe that
like that would be jail time if they
knew that but you know maybe maybe I I
suppose anything's impossible at this
point
all right
um but we're in the uh
the phase where how about college
professors
what percentage of college professors
across all disciplines you know these
are the smartest most analytical people
what percentage of them took the
vaccination
close to 100 percent
well over 90 percent
right so
if you ask why did Elon Musk get
vaccinated
you have to ask why did the people who
make the thing get vaccinated why do the
people who know the most the CDC get
vaccinated why did all of our
politicians get vaccinated why did
almost all college professors get
vaccinated
why did Dr fauci himself get vaccinated
now some of them maybe they're lying but
uh
our professor is 100
you're right I think you're right
paranoia all right let me let me go to
the board
all right
having uh having said as clearly as
possible that the anti-vaxx people seem
to be the winners
I want you to hear that clearly the
anti-vaxx people appear to be the
winners
but I'd like to give you a little lesson
on how to properly analyze things what
to compare to what right
there's a report uh historically you
know X number of people reported bad
vaccination related things for different
vaccinations as soon as the uh the jab
became available the kova jab the Veris
report skyrocketed to levels never seen
before
now this is a comparison of the covid
vaccination
to Prior vaccinations
suppose now the various report of course
is not a study but suppose it's all true
what would that tell you
what it would tell you is
that the coveted vaccination is way more
dangerous
than prior vaccinations
so far so good
that you know even if it's inaccurate
it's so different
that it's definitely telling you
something
would you agree it's definitely telling
you something and something you should
totally pay attention to
all agree
but is this the right comparison
no this is the wrong comparison it's the
right comparison for looking for a
danger signal
that's the right way to use it it's the
wrong comparison to tell you if you
should or should not take the
vaccination
here's the correct comparison for that
it's comparing the outcomes of the
vaxxed versus the unvaxxed or the shot
versus unshocked because you don't want
to call it a vaccination in the early
days this is the data whether it was
true or not we don't know if it's true
we don't trust any data but the early
Alpha Delta situation where the virus
was more deadly
it seemed that the unvaxed were having
worse outcomes
now I'm not saying it's true
but you'd all agree that was that's what
we were presented with right
this is the correct comparison it might
not be the correct data and it might not
be the correct decision
but it's the correct comparison right
you don't compare
coveted in a pandemic
to other vaccinations not in a pandemic
that doesn't make any sense at all it's
just a signal to look look deeper that's
all it is this is where you look once
this gives you the signal then you look
over here
and this was telling us the opposite
of what this was caring about us but
this was the correct comparison
were they lying to us about the data
were were people being over counted and
or under counted yes
is there any is there any pandemic data
that you should trust
no so I'm not saying this is accurate
I'm saying that was the context in which
all these smart people got vaccinated
would you agree with that
would you agree that the context of
which all these smart people got
vaccinated from musk to Dr Malone Etc
was when it looked like there was a big
difference between the outcomes
even if it was wrong and even if it
didn't count side effects right
yeah so that's where we were so it's
easy to see how smart people
would have gotten vaccinated but
correct me if I'm wrong because I might
be a little out of date is it true that
the current information we're getting
which is no longer the deadliest virus
is Omicron
that we're seeing this happen which is
this is reversed we're seeing more of
the people with vaccinations who having
bad problems can you confirm
can you confirm that the situation has
reversed at least in the data
from when all those smart people got
vaccinated
so the same smart people who got
vaccinated are not getting boosted I
don't think musk got boosted I don't
think that um
Dr Malone got boosted
I know I didn't get boosted
because I'm now in this context
now what does this tell you is this
telling you that the that getting vaxed
is more dangerous than not being vaxxed
no it's not telling you that that's the
wrong comparisons
see it's always a comparison problem
it's always the same problem it's a
wrong comparison because the at this
point
the people who are getting vaccinated
are old frail people
right
if the old frail people didn't get
vaccinated
they'd probably be dying at twice that
rate according to the experts who might
be lying to us who knows right so that's
not my opinion so what you should
compare here is that these old frail
people
do not compare them to the unbacks
compare them to the old frail people who
didn't get vexed
right
so you should only look at old frail
people compared to Old frail people but
at this point every old frail person is
vexed
am I right
everybody who was old and frail
got pushed into it because why
because they're old and frail
if you're old and frail do you think you
put up a fight
about the vaccination
not a chance now Grandma at 80 years old
did not have a choice of getting a
vaccination I mean on paper she did but
she didn't right so basically you're
just vexing the out of the people
who are going to die tomorrow anyway
you should see this
this doesn't tell you the vaccinations
don't work
it also doesn't tell you they do
it literally doesn't tell you anything
because it's not a comparison that makes
sense you're comparing healthy people to
frail people under every situation the
frail people are going to be dying even
if you did all the right stuff
you could do everything right for this
group and they're still going to die 10
times more than healthy people
does that make sense
so
I'm going to try to have it both ways
I'm going to try to have it both ways
the anti-vaxxers clearly are the winners
at this point and I think it'll probably
stay that way
and and I don't want to put any shade on
that whatsoever
they came out the best they they have
the winning position
but
if you think they got there by good
Analytics
that didn't happen
no that didn't happen
because you could analyze it correctly
and make the wrong decision
would you agree
would you agree that you could analyze
it with the best analytical capabilities
but all the data was
the data was just so there
wasn't really anything that we knew or
could or could guess
so my take was always this
it's going to be a guess
because I don't know what long covet
would do to me and I still don't
but I also didn't know what the
vaccination would do to me and I still
don't
so to me it was two unknowns that were
both enormous and both of them could
have ended your life or your life
quality
so
I waited as long as possible to reduce
the risk that something quick would
happen I looked at people in my category
and that I did what people in my
category were typically doing
am I glad
no
no I'm not glad
no because it because as things turned
out
the unvaccinated have a current
advantage
because they they feel better the the
thing they're not worrying about is what
I have to worry about which is I wonder
if that vaccination five years from now
not regret
all right let me stop you right there
did you hear me say I regretted anything
did anything sound like regret
no
also if the data had gone the other way
I would not ask the anti-vaxxers to
regret it either
do you know I would not yes if it go on
the other way if the data had let's say
amazingly said this was just a miracle
drug and everybody who didn't get it was
a big old dope
would I be telling you you should regret
not getting it
no I wouldn't
because you didn't know
and I didn't know
we were just doing the best we could
but it does it it does turn out
that the the heuristic or the rule of
thumb that everything the government
does is bad for you
it turns out it worked this time
it worked this time
because really the anti-vaxxers I think
were really just distrustful of big
companies in big government
that's never wrong
is never wrong to distrust government
it's never wrong to distrust big
companies but
it wasn't necessarily right right
every now and then a big company will
produce a good product at a good price
and nobody dies
hey it happens every every now and then
our government does something right
sometimes
sometimes it happens right
so if you just took the position let's
just distrust everything the government
did well you won
you won
you won completely right now
as far as I know I I feel like I'm on a
shrinking piece of ice
floating in the ocean right somehow I
got trapped on a little iceberg in the
ocean it's just like shrinking as I'm
floating into the sun
I am currently in the only remaining
category of people
who might have made the um statistically
right choice
by accident
totally by accident because people in my
age group
it looks like maybe there was still some
benefit
not necessarily to me personally which
is why I made the wrong choice
or the sub-optimal choice wrong implies
that I analyzed it wrong
suboptimal means you know you may have
analyzed it right but you didn't end up
in the right place I did not end up in
the right place
agree
you would all agree with that right I
did not end up in the right place
the right place would be natural
immunity no no vaccination
but to say that I got there by making
bad decisions
that's a completely different argument I
think I think the people who understood
how to make decisions
all ended up in the wrong place
because they knew how to make good
decisions
just the data was unfortunately not good
so
what do you think
I'm not seeing much pushback so I I
think
so I think maybe we're almost on the
same page here so the weird the weird
thing is we're actually coming together
in the weirdest way
in the in the weirdest way I think you
know our positions are starting to merge
yeah
uh
what's from Ben Garrison's cartoon
well bengar Ben Garrison's uh the
is literally an idiot
so I I'm not I would not argue with that
uh idiots got the wrong the right would
you agree with the following statement
some idiots got the right decision
some idiots got the wrong decision
some Geniuses got the right decision
some Geniuses got the wrong decision and
lots of them you know not just some like
lots of them
so what does it what does that tell you
about intelligence
there if all of your data is uh
non-credible intelligence doesn't help
you
that should be your conclusion this is
an intelligence didn't have any role in
this
but instead the people who ended up in
the right place
are enjoying
the feeling that they were the Smart
Ones and that it was obvious all along
and here's where I'm going to make a
departure from my past
if you're one of those people
that has to feel really good
doesn't it
how many of you are feeling like that
like that righteous oh my God I was
right from day one
that has to feel great
I think you should enjoy it
and so I'm going to say enjoy it and you
can enjoy it at my expense
you can even enjoy it at my expense but
don't be don't be inaccurate don't be
inaccurate about me but just enjoy your
feeling
it might be my opinion that what we've
proven Beyond any question whatsoever is
that your intelligence and your wisdom
and your experience had nothing to do
with your decisions and that they were
not that being smart and being well
informed just didn't help at all didn't
help at all
but you should take victory and I should
take defeat we can agree on that right
that that my position is now the weakest
and and your position has gone from the
weakest to the strongest
and that we can just say that's true
now this is how I try to protect myself
from cognitive dissonance
the way I try to do it
is by being wrong without hesitation
when when it looks like that's the case
the people who didn't give acts are
absolutely in the winning position
we all guessed you guessed right and and
when we guess right what do we always do
we say it was because we were smart
you don't think I would have said the
same thing
I hope I wouldn't have
like my My Hope for myself is if it
turned out that getting vaccinated was
just unambiguously the right thing to do
and let's say it cured your cancer at
the same time that's not the case but
suppose I'd been right
I like to think I would have told you I
guessed
I like to think I would have said you
know I got everything right but honestly
it was a guess because I couldn't have
known
I don't know if I would maybe I would
maybe I would be doing what you're doing
like you know dancing on the graves of
the people who got it wrong I might be
but I like to think I wouldn't be like
you
but you win
do you win
you win
you are the winners
you are the winners all right let me say
that part with no ambiguity you won you
won
I don't know if you somebody says you
got to write for the wrong reason no
uh that would be too strong I'm not
going to say you've got it right for the
wrong reason because your reason was you
didn't trust the big companies and you
didn't trust the government
how is that wrong
that was exactly right
no you didn't get it right you didn't
get it right for the wrong reason
it was impossible to know
but your heuristics worked
and my analytics did not
Fair
all of my fancy analytics got me to a
bad place
all of your heuristics don't trust these
guys it's obvious
totally worked
now there may be a class of people
who use your heuristic
did not get vaccinated and are dead
do you think any of those exist
do you think there's anybody who did the
same thing some of you did most of you
probably and said no no I don't trust
the government did not get vaccinated
and then they died
but they're not here to
to be part of the conversation
so you can take total Victory because
the people who would argue with you are
already dead
so there's nobody here to call you wrong
I'm here and I'm calling you right
so the people are here
are more likely to say yeah I guess you
got it right the people who would
disagree with you are all dead
so they're not here to argue with you
yeah
all right
they would be dead either way maybe so
maybe so
all right ladies and gentlemen that is
my provocative live stream for today
I was gaslighted
weren't we all
um
that pilot story is true by the way well
I heard from a uh oh on the pilot story
so there's a story about
um rich people don't want to hire pilots
who were vaccinated
and that got conflated with
uh commercial airline pilots in general
commercial airline pilots in general if
you're working for one of the big
Airlines
they're not going to be penalized for
being vaccinated
if you're a rich person who's anti-vaxx
you know you might just have a personal
preference for an unvaccinated pilot
that's just a personal preference
so I think that affects probably a
I don't know what percentage of Pilots
but so it does seem like there's two
different situations
so much more you don't know
wasn't that always true there's somebody
here saying there's so much more I don't
know
that's always true
uh
how was how was Sri Lanka forced by the
wef to give up fertilizer
wasn't it just the leader trusted him
wasn't it just the leader make the
decision the WF didn't make anybody in
Sri Lanka do anything
all right I guess I don't understand
that
all right um
the leader was Waf so the leader was a
wef
person
so all right but he he wasn't forced by
the WF he just believed him that was the
problem
and he but he also acted in a way they
didn't recommend
because the WF didn't recommend that all
countries stopped doing that
he just he just took it too far
yeah messing with the food supply that
was crazy
um
watch the doctor Drew interview is lenko
you know you know what I was expecting
but never uh haven't seen yet I kept
expecting somebody
and I don't think this is the case to
say that the excess deaths were caused
by anti-vaxxers who were taking
hydroxychloroquine and hydro and uh and
I've Rebecca
didn't you expect that story
because at around the same time that the
vaccinations kicked in
don't you think people were also
um taking a lot of ivermectin
hydroxychloroquine at about the same
time
now I don't think those things were
killing anybody but didn't you expect
somebody would try to make that case you
know some pro-vaxxer would say well
it's not the vaccinations that kill you
it's the hydroxychloroquine that we told
you not to take it just just you'd
expect somebody to try that like I don't
think it's the case but you'd expect
somebody to try it
yeah
all right uh have I forgotten any
stories
Sweden for the win
anybody who believes this Sweden uh
made all the right choices and got a
good outcome
that's just so not what happened
that's so not what happened
Sweden just has too many differences let
me just tell you one thing about Sweden
that you didn't know did you know that
the swedes routinely uh
supplement their vitamin D
because they know they don't get enough
Sun
so it's very typical to take like I
don't know the cod oil or what the fish
oil or something uh so they're they're
all vitamin D
so that helps number two the apparently
it's the easiest culture to stay away
from people
because it's not that dense and they
have the highest ratio of people who
live alone
and also have a second home
so that they could thirdly
even though they didn't have mandates
people did naturally
stay away from each other because it was
a pandemic
so
if you think Sweden ignored everything
and got a pretty good outcome
just everything about Sweden is
different
you can't compare
huh
uh I don't know anything about the J and
J being the better choice
no hydroxychloroquine is not listed as a
treatment
it's not true
except on some fake website
uh you have bonuses for getting wow
I also think the swedes are probably not
very fat and they're not very old
so basically they had everything working
for him
and
and their results look exactly like
you'd expect
for their country
yeah the J J wasn't available to me I
didn't have that option
all right that's enough for now YouTube
talk to you later
