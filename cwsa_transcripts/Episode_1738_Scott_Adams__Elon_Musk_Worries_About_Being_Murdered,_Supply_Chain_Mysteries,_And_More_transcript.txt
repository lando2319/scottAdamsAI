good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with scott adams
and today we will be talking about 2000
mules we will be talking about elon musk
we will be talking about the war in
ukraine and all things interesting
and some other stuff too you're going to
love it it's going to be the best time
you ever had while you're exercising or
getting ready for work or possibly
commuting and all you need to make it
extra special is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker chelsea steiner canteen joker
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dope mean hit of the day thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous
go
ah
so good
delicious
well here's a cool story in technology
so apparently lockheed martin is
building these uh
hybrid airships they're part uh
lighter than air what do they put in
helium or something
so they fill them with a gas but they're
actually heavier than air
but they've designed them
to be gigantic
so now they've got orders for these
hybrid airships that are the size of a
football field
and they're very stable apparently and
they can carry 20 tons of cargo
to remote spaces
which is a pretty big deal
because a lot of remote spaces are where
you drill for oil or you need resources
or
you know you got to bring them something
so
i can't imagine what would be cooler
than traveling by gigantic airship
i wouldn't mind that it was slow
i would just think it would be a cool
way to travel in luxury
uh don't we need these i think we need
gigantic airships let's get these going
by the way here's a cool little uh
related factoid when i was testing
virtual reality goggles i think it was
htc's goggles now this was about three
years ago
one of the contents that you could
explore
was you could go into the hindenburg
the airship that caught on fire and was
destroyed and you could walk you could
walk around inside it you could go to
the the control
area where the pilot is you can walk
into the back you know area and see
stuff scattered around but the funniest
thing was that on the airship that you
know caught fire and blew up
uh they had a smoking room
there's actually a room with little
ashtrays that was their smoking room on
the on the on the hindenburg
anyway
rasmussen has a poll
um they ask people among other things
how likely is it that climate change
will be a catastrophe in the next
hundred years
and half of the people who asked about
50
thought that it was a good chance or at
least likely
a little bit likely so half of the
country thinks there's a catastrophe
coming in next hundred years
do those people reproduce
here here's an evolutionary question
if you looked at the half of the country
that believes that everything's going to
go to hell
versus the half the things everything
will be okay
do they have the same amount of children
what do you think
in theory they would have fewer children
right
does it work that way maybe it's not
that direct
but i do wonder if
scaring one side
uh has a difference in
who ultimately survives
because the ones who are not afraid will
be the ones who have children
they do not reproduce that's why they
need immigrants
that's an interesting concept
if the left is in favor of abortion
and maybe less in favor of traditional
marriage and traditional children having
it wouldn't make sense that they would
be in favor of immigration because it
would be the only way to
repopulate the country that actually
makes sense
it's the first time i thought of that
that was a good comment
and now i have to think about a little
more is there any connection there or is
that a coincidence
is it a coincidence
that the people who want to create their
own humans
don't want as many to come from the
outside but the ones who can't or won't
think they need some more outside people
because they can't make their own
huh
kind of makes sense
all right uh rasmussen also asked who's
in favor of drilling doing more drilling
60 of the country was leaning in that in
that direction
which makes sense
um you know that's basically most
republicans and
you pick up a few independents and stuff
i guess
and
52 said biden should focus on oil and
gas prices
which i don't know how you could do
much about them except for drilling more
and building more pipelines
and 34 percent say uh
we should we should focus more on
limiting carbon dioxide emissions
so that's where we are as a country
now
what would the country look like if half
of the country were not convinced that
we had a catastrophe in the next hundred
years
i feel as though
the news has really changed the entire
nature of
innovation and technology that
in fact the direction of civilization
itself
is really kind of dependent on what we
think about climate change isn't it so
climate change is kind of the
macro thing that's guiding everything
all the smaller decisions
what if it's wrong
it would mean that the news
basically you know trimmed 50 trillion
dollars off the gdp for no good reason
but i do think that fighting against
climate change even if it's not going to
be a catastrophe
which i think it won't be because i
think we'll respond to it not because it
isn't a problem
just to be clear
i'm not saying it's not a problem
i just think we'll figure out how to
respond to it adequately
um
let's talk about two thousand mules
everybody says scott
why don't you go watch dinesh d'souza's
big hit movie 2000 mules which refers to
the mules being humans
who allegedly
ballot harvested and brought ballots to
boxes and maybe stuff them with people
who weren't going to vote
on their own
so we don't know that exactly what
crimes may or may not have been
perpetrated there but here's the worst
advice i'm getting it goes like this
scott scott scott
do not form an opinion on this movie
unless you've watched it
does that sound reasonable
do you think it's reasonable that i
should not form my opinion until i watch
the movie how many think that that's a
reasonable thing to say
pretty reasonable right
but to have an opinion on a movie
without watching it
what would that make me
well what would you think of me
if i had a strong opinion about the
movie or didn't have any opinion
but i had not watched it
yeah
you're all wrong
you're all dead wrong you could not be
more wrong than the answers you give me
right now
and i'm going to change your mind and
you won't believe how easily i'll do it
because right now the most obvious clear
smarter thing that anybody could say
is that you have to watch the movie
before forming an opinion
that is the cleanest most obvious thing
anybody could ever tell you
it's also
100 wrong
100 wrong couldn't be more wrong
now let me change your mind uh give me
60 seconds
60 seconds i'll change your mind
watch the
michael jackson documentary
that says he absolutely definitely
molested a bunch of children absolutely
when you watch that documentary you will
be convinced that he definitely did
those crimes
then watch the documentary that came out
later
this says that the accusations are
 and there's no way he did any
of that stuff
you know what will happen
you will walk away completely convinced
that he did nothing and that he was set
up
it i'm done
if you think watching one documentary
tells you something you don't know
anything
you've learned nothing
you've learned nothing
so if you think that watching the
documentary will give me an opinion
that will tell me that
either there was fraud or there was not
you're so wrong
you could not be more wrong
i will not
form an opinion
after watching the movie i promise you i
won't
i'll watch the movie i'm definitely
going to watch the movie you don't have
to argue about that but i'm not going to
form an opinion from it
why
why
why will i not form an opinion after
watching it
and why did you you all formed an
opinion
why are you all wrong and i'm right
because you haven't seen the opposite
documentary
have you
if somebody made another documentary
whose only purpose was to debunk this
documentary do you think it would be
persuasive
it might all be lies but it would be
persuasive
right i'm not saying that the debunk
would be the accurate one and this is
not accurate could easily be the
opposite
or they're both inaccurate it could be
any of those things but if you don't
understand that any good documentary
will convince you it's true
you haven't learned a thing
let me say that again because i want to
insult you a little bit
because i want you to feel this like i
want you to be mad at me right now like
i actually actually be a little pissed
off at me
if you think that watching any
documentary
gives you information
you're wrong
you're as wrong as you could be
you could not be more wrong about
anything than that
now
but let me say clearly
i do have my suspicions about the
election
and i do imagine
well i'm quite sure of it i'm sure if i
watch the documentary i will be even
more certain
at the end of it that something
sketchy happened
those of you have seen it would you
agree with that assessment
that if i watch it i will certainly come
away with the impression
that something sketchy happened right
now why do i have to watch it since i
already know what will happen
doesn't your advice sound ridiculous now
there's a hundred percent chance that i
know what will happen if i watch it
without even knowing what the content is
there's a hundred percent chance it will
convince me
so that's the reason
that i'm telling you that if you were
convinced by the documentary the only
thing you learned
is that documentaries are persuasive
if you think you learned that an
election was sketchy because you watched
a documentary and this is not about
dinesh d'souza this is not about 2000
mules
this is about
thinking you learn something from a
 documentary it doesn't work that
way
the documentary is meant to show you one
side
if you don't see the other side you know
absolutely nothing
like okay i'm being too much of an
 about this
but
how many of you are bothered and
persuaded at the same time
have i made my point
if you feel certainty because you
watched a documentary no matter how well
done
no matter how accurate no matter how
credible no matter how correct
if you formed a certain opinion by
watching one side
you've learned nothing you've learned
nothing in five years
nothing
and i'm really disappointed
honestly i'm seriously disappointed
do you not see that you're being fed
exactly what you wanted to believe
how hard is it to convince you of
something you already believed
it's easy
it's easy
so just be a little bit more critical
about this movie please
please be more critical
doesn't mean it's wrong
doesn't mean it's wrong
in fact the you know what i've what i've
heard of it sounds
like a reasonable approach
and by the way i've looked at the debunk
and the debunk looks like
does that make you happy
so i haven't seen the movie but i've
seen the debunk and i read the debunk i
was like
that's the best you can do for a debunk
that maybe the cell phone data isn't as
accurate as it should be to know that
somebody actually put something in a box
that's where you're going to bank your
argument on
we've got zillions of videos of people
putting multiple things in boxes
then add the cell phone data that says
same people went to multiple boxes lots
of times are you telling me
you know that that well first of all
that doesn't prove that there's a crime
but you definitely can't debunk it
do you think that could be debunked
i don't think it can be proven or
debunked so if you believe the debunk
you're a idiot let me say that
again
if you believed
any debunk of the movie
you're a idiot
if you believe the movie
because it agrees with what you believed
and you think that watching a
documentary tells you something
you're a idiot
sorry
[Laughter]
let me apologize to you
before i go on i don't mean to offend
but i am trying to get your blood
boiling a little bit right
because
i'm honestly
concerned
like genuinely i'm concerned
if you believe documentaries if you
think if you know you learn to not
believe the news right
don't you feel better that you don't
believe the news
don't believe documentaries and again
this has nothing to do with this
documentary just don't believe
documentaries period
you learn not to believe the news this
is your next lesson
all right
how many of you tried to watch 2000
mules as i did several times
and were thwarted each time by various
issues
i did a little poll because i was
wondering
am i just having some kind of massive
boomer problem here
that every time i go to watch this
 movie i can't figure out how to
do it
and 30 percent of the people who
who responded so they couldn't figure
out how to watch the movie
let me tell you
so this is a subset of my discussion the
other day
let me apologize to hugh
i didn't mean to call you stupid hugh so
i apologize for that
um
what was i talking about oh
so i've said before that streaming
movies has become impossible to do
because you can never remember which
platform you wanted to watch and your
password's always wrong and your credit
card expired and
you can't find the thing and it's not
out yet there's every other problem
so i've tried now i think five
to purchase or watch the movie
i failed all five times now i'm still
gonna do it
because that's actually my normal amount
of failing to watch a live stream
so once i click the link to go to rumble
and the page never opened
so one time rumble just i don't know the
server didn't work or i don't know i
don't i don't know the reason
i've clicked on several links that
purport to be the movie but aren't i've
clicked on several links that purport to
be the movie but are really the trailer
i've clicked on several links to places
where it used to be but it's cancelled
i've gone to locals now by the way i i'm
an investor in locals
i went to locals and there was a page i
didn't recognize
i couldn't tell if it was telling me to
subscribe
for a year or it was just buying the
movie so i thought uh
i don't know is there some place i could
watch it for free
because i didn't want to put in my
credit card information unless i had to
just the work it wasn't the seven bucks
or whatever i didn't care about the
money it was just in order to do the
work
so then i look for it for free and then
i go to rumble and
rumble you know again i got a trailer
instead of the movie and then my wi-fi
broke
uh and then i got to i finally went back
to locals and tried to buy it there
because i figured out it looks like some
kind of special page just for content by
and it didn't say
i mean the page was so unclear i didn't
want i didn't know if i was buying a
subscription to locals or buying just
the content i couldn't tell from the
page
and then
then finally i got to the point where i
said all right i guess this is how i buy
it so i started putting in my credit
card information
and i didn't have my credit card on me
it's in another part of the house
and
where i have it written down i have the
old one
and so i thought i have a rule
that i won't get up and go get my wallet
i'll just cancel what i'm doing and do
something else
so that was the last time i tried
so the next time i try maybe i'll not
try unless i have my credit card near me
and everything so by the way so how many
have a similar experience
where you went to watch the movie and
you just got thwarted time and time
again
am i
in the comments
other people yes i'm seeing some yeses
now again this has not almost nothing to
do with a specific movie so this is not
about locals it's not about rumble it's
not about 2000 mules it's about
streaming
streaming is now so hard you just can't
do it
thirty percent of time you gotta do it
you just don't you end up doing
something else instead yeah look at all
the yeses to this now i know this is a
boomer problem right you don't hear
anybody who's 30 years old arguing you
know even talking about this stuff
but there are a lot of boomers and we're
trying to watch this thing so there's an
interface problem
all right
why why isn't the supply chain the
biggest story that it's the only thing
we're talking about
what's going on there what do you think
because it seemed to me that the supply
chain was a you know end of civilization
size problem not really but you know
really really big
and then it just got worse right
so it was the worst problem in the world
and then it even got worse
but we don't really talk about it much
at all
and yeah we're talking about baby
formula
but here's the thing that's that's the
exception that proves the rule right
the fact that we're only talking about
baby formula
and microchips now and then
that seems a smallish problem doesn't it
not if you have a baby it's the biggest
problem in the world but in terms of
everybody
and even the baby formula thing probably
will figure it out i imagine
but i'm wondering if this is what's
happening
could it be that the supply chain is
making enough corrections
that the important stuff is getting
through
and that the things we're waiting for we
were sort of used to waiting for
prior to a supply chain problem have you
ever tried to buy furniture
buy a piece of furniture
with no supply chain problems whatsoever
go back five years no problem with the
supply chain
how long does it take to get furniture
six months
just normal how about ordering a car
with no supply chain problems
you order a car
months
months right to get a car and that's
normal
so the things that i'm waiting for are
things that i thought i would wait for
anyway
and in some cases maybe add two months
but it was you know such as my drum set
i ordered an electronic drum set took
several months
but i don't really care
you know so maybe they say well if your
ship has electronic drum sets on it you
can wait
and if you've got something important on
it like a microchip well go to the front
line
so i'm guessing that there was an 80 20
thing that happened
where instead of just first first come
first serve
they just do the 20 that's the 80
important
and so we don't notice that things are
20 degraded because we're getting our
important stuff is that what's happening
so i i feel like that must be what's
happening where it's not being reported
but i'm assuming that the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters is in play
that there are millions of people making
millions of small adjustments
to get the important stuff to us faster
and maybe slow the less important stuff
i guess
so but i also don't know if we're near
some kind of breaking point
are we literally going to run out of
food
at this point i would say my grocery
stores have more things than they did
during the pandemic
i don't know about baby formula
so i have more things and i would say
that the weight for goods that i ordered
by mail is not too bad
i've probably ordered
i don't know 25 things by
um
by amazon
in the past now maybe month
say 25 things i think
one of them is
and it's a trivial product
delayed a month that's about it and it
was trivial
all right ports don't work that way
somebody says they don't work that way
but they could
there's no reason you couldn't put the
important ones to the front of the line
i don't see any physical reason you
couldn't do that
food is from the usa china stuff is
delayed that's that's probably what's
going on that the food is mostly us food
but we've got massive droughts and
we've got problems with uh fertilizers
and all kinds of things so we'll see
elon musk
tweeted this today
or yesterday if i die under mysterious
circumstances it's been nice knowing you
what no further explanation
if i die under
suspicious circumstances
or mysterious
now let me ask you this do you think
he's serious
do you think he's seriously concerned
that somebody will kill him
i think yes
yes i think that's real
i think that's absolutely real
i don't think the odds are very high
but i think that's absolutely real
now do you think that if you're the
richest person in the world you have
access to
presumably politicians and power brokers
and the people who really can see behind
the curtain
aren't you a little worried that
somebody who can see behind the curtain
way better than you can thinks that
there's somebody back there who might
murder him
for what
buying twitter and finding out what the
deal was there
i feel as if he already knows
he's going to find something at twitter
that will be really really bad for
somebody who has power
what do you think
now he's being ambiguous here so we
don't know what topic he's even
referring to
you know we don't know if it's based on
some specific information or just a
general fear could be just trolling
could be just being interesting who
knows but
uh i'm worried about it
because he knows more than you do about
how stuff works in the real world
right i know a little bit and maybe more
than some of you just because i have
access to some stuff
but he has way more access
than just about anybody right and he
probably is already getting
here's my guess this is pure speculation
can you see any possibility
that twitter insiders are not already
talking to musk
don't you think that's already happening
don't you think there's somebody who
wanted to suck up to him in the
technical world and said look
before you you know get complete control
of the company let me tell you what's
going on here and where to look i'll
tell you where to find the bad stuff
you don't think that's happening
there's got to be somebody who thinks
it's in their best interest to do
exactly that there's got to be at least
one secret conservative or
patriot or just free speech person they
don't even have to be republican or
anything but there has to be at least
one person at twitter who knows how to
reach musk
and knows what the deal is
don't you think
by now he's probably heard uh at least
rumors of why he might find
and he and if and if the rumors about
what he might find or how he might
control twitter also
is enough to make him worried about
being murdered
there's there's probably something there
but we'll see
so after he tweets if i die under
mysterious circumstances it's been nice
knowing you his mother tweets
that's not funny
and then he tweets back to his mother
maya
elon tweets sorry i will do my best to
stay alive
how small the world gets
when you know you feel like you're
talking directly to elon musk and then
he's talking to his mom and you're part
of the conversation it just makes the
whole world seem
so small and personal it's kind of
awesome
and then some saudi person with a lot of
followers
was saying that if he
something about a blessing if he dies
and elon musk replied i'm okay going to
hell if i die because the vast majority
of all humans ever born will be there
now
remember when you thought that trump was
the best tweeter of all times
and maybe he is maybe he is
but you can't get much better at
tweeting than this
and and sure enough his uh
his tweeting to replace all marketing is
working again
i mean i could not be more interested in
twitter
right now because of his involvement
and i'm sure that my
twitter numbers are probably still going
up i i think it has more to do with him
buying the company let's try let's see
i'll check my twitter growth now
because we all a lot of the conservative
leaning
folks had big bumps let's see what
happens is it still high
yes it is so the day before elon musk
was announcing things my numbers were
anywhere from under 100 new followers a
day
to you know 300 b would be a good day
as soon as you bought it these are the
number of new followers 3 300 10 times
so on the day they bought it i got 10
times the number of new followers the
next day the next day 20 times next day
10 times next day 15 times next day
about uh eight times
and we're still at uh
today or yesterday was uh 856 new
followers
so it's a it's some kind of a multiple
or two or three or something or ten
number of followers
and um
[Music]
i don't feel that that's just the shadow
banning thing being
loosened
i feel like it might be just more people
coming to the platform
so i think his his marketing might be
working and by the way that's what he
says he says it's just people coming to
the platform
you might be right
i've noticed that elon has responded
directly to mike cernovich
at least several times
and it's interesting to see how much
he's on that cernovich is on
uh musk's radar
they clearly have you know some
commonality of thinking about some of
these important things
and
uh one of the most interesting ways to
watch the news
is to watch who knows who
to know who's influencing whom and you
know what what
alliances are being formed
and
so mike cervich printed out a left-wing
account that was um talking violently
and noting that that person had not been
banned by twitter and elon musk uh
responded to that tweet from cervich
saying that twitter obviously has a
strong left-wing bias
so there it is
so um there's no doubt about what elon
musk intends nor about what he thinks
about this whole situation which i love
are you following this whole situation
with steve schmidt
he was one of the
lincoln project anti-trumper famous
people
and
he he went on this
tweeting tirade
where for somebody followed it and said
for 24 hours
he just kept tweeting like crazy and
hardly took any time off from tweeting
and it takes a minute and a half just to
scroll through all of his tweets for
that one day
and people are asking is there something
wrong with him
does he have a mental issue or is there
some kind of drug he's on and of course
we don't know right we're just watching
him act differently but as someone smart
said
the only times they've ever seen this
kind of a change in behavior
wasn't because of mental health
it wasn't because of a sudden mental
health problem
but people have seen sudden changes like
this when some kind of drug was involved
now i'm not suggesting he's on any drugs
i'm just saying his behavior looks
unusual for his past behavior
and uh
it looked like drugs to me
so
again i'm not making that allegation
because we're just observers but there's
something going on and i think that we
have to
um when somebody says he's a narcissist
and that's what's going it could be it
could be that that's all that's going on
but the uh
the amber herd or amber turd trial
has definitely alerted us
to how uh a certain group of people act
you know with projection and gaslighting
and you know
lying about everything and blah blah
blah blah
and it seems to me
that uh this looks exactly like
something's going on there so there's
either you know personality disorder
mental illness which are sort of cousins
uh or
some kind of change in medication or
or or drug situation
but
watching somebody at this level of uh
i guess you know what do we call it uh
prominence
uh watching him sort of melt down in
public i hate to use that meltdown
because people use that about me
whenever i get on a rant he's melting
down
so i withdraw that word
but there's something going on
that and i think that we have to be
careful about knowing what is a
political opinion and what is a health
problem i'm not sure we're good at that
um
oh cope is about is about word yeah
i feel like we should be a little
smarter about knowing what's a health
problem
um wall street journal has an article in
which they talk about a uh
study that said with kids who have
healthy early attachments to a caregiver
such as a parent
so if they have a good loving protected
relationship with a parent at least one
they'll be in better shape to with
withstand
the uh let's see the lure of social
media and the social media won't bother
them as much because they've had some
love and
and
care from a parent
now that's one interpretation is that
the kids who had early good associations
with parents can resist
social media better
here's the other interpretation
every kid is different
how about that how about that's the
whole explanation how about some kids
are born
uh the kind of kid who will easily form
an attachment to an adult
do you think every kid is capable of
forming a strong attachment to an adult
it's not up to the parent
the kid is part of the process right
have you not been around enough kids to
know that some form attachments with
adults and some don't
and the adult would act the same every
time it's always the kid the kid decides
if they have an attachment to you you
don't get to decide that
it's not your decision how attached to
kid is going to be to you
it's the kids decision and have you ever
seen you know three kids
raised the same but one of them has an
attachment one doesn't
i mean
you know this is this is such an
obviously study because to me
the the biggest part of this is just
that the kids are biologically
genetically they have different impulses
some of them have an impulse to be close
to a parent some don't
or some act differently maybe they have
the same desire but they act differently
to get it
and so i would say this is yet another
study that you shouldn't put any
credibility in oh whatsoever
well here's
here's
the story that i find most interesting
today so russia had its may 9th
victory day
celebration and it's a it's a world war
ii victory celebration and normally they
parade their military stuff and they
talk about how awesome they are
uh and people were expecting biden or
they're expecting putin to say something
like they were having victories in
ukraine but he didn't
so he claimed no victory in ukraine even
partial victory no no victory he claims
um
and here's the but here's what he did
say
you said that the uh russian soldiers
are fighting bravely in ukraine they're
fighting bravely
now here is the linguistic path that
this has taken
at the beginning of the war
all the smart people said
and of course i don't think any real
smart people said this some smart people
is sort of in quotes
let's say the media was saying that
russia would just conquer ukraine in two
days and in and out
now
then they went from
they'll crush them in 48 hours to okay
it's not going to be 48 hours come on
people we you know even even
the united states took longer than that
to conquer iraq you know the two two
days was sort of hyperbole it never
really meant two days come on it really
meant
that russia is so much stronger military
that they will definitely win
yeah it just might take a little longer
but they're definitely definitely going
to win just takes a little longer
all right so we went from two days
they're going to win
to well they're going to win it's just
going to take take a while
and then
the next step we have achieved in which
putin says that his team is
fighting bravely
let me give you some advice
never join the team that's fighting
bravely
do you know what fighting bravely means
it means you lose it
not nobody who's winning is called
fighting bravely
when people are winning
it's called winning
victory
winning
they they conquered this land they beat
this army
they won
fighting
and i'm not arguing that russia is
losing
i'm not i'm not arguing that i'm saying
that the linguistic path
went all the way from easy win
to tough win to
oh
at least we're fighting bravely
to me that sounds like russia feels
they're losing
but they're fighting bravely
now you can say scott you're reading too
much into this
to which i say yeah maybe
but this linguistic path is very clear
it's very clear
i didn't make this up
i mean you could look at the coverage
yourself it did go from two days to oh
they'll get it done they'll just take a
while
to fighting bravely
that really happened
and
suddenly the news coverage from there
seems to be all the same
there's more fighting in x tomorrow let
me predict the headlines tomorrow
there's more fighting in mario pole
there's more fighting in the east
the ukrainians have pushed back the
russians and some places that probably
aren't important
still having troubles getting weapons to
ukraine
right
how hard would it be for me to tell you
the news tomorrow
pretty easy oh somebody's reading god's
debris
i think you'll find that quite timely
uh
i fought bravely to stream 2000 mules
yes
but i failed i will succeed
um
the poland ambassador from russia so
russia's poland ambassador one of them
was at an event to mark i guess the
victory day and he was hit with red
paint
at a poland victory day event
so the the ambassador is standing there
and the interesting thing is he's not
trying to clean the paint off his face
he wouldn't fool jesse's smullet and and
left the
you know left the paint on and just made
sure everybody got a good picture of it
and i thought to myself
that's a pretty good diplomat
that's a pretty good diplomat
that he didn't get angry when he was
covered with paint and he didn't even
take it off he just let everybody take a
picture of it
interesting
um
why do you still use msm as a new source
i use them as a mocking source
if you haven't watched my content
well i think there's going to be a lot
more of that i think it's going to be
real tough for any kind of russian
diplomat
to feel safe in any country anywhere i
think russian diplomats are
unfortunately
going to be targeted i don't
don't
endorse that but i think it's going to
happen
more of it anyway
all right here's an interesting story it
was a new york post article by melanie
notkin
and she's talking about the wage gap and
the trouble that women and women will
have finding a partner
now the good news is
that
women's incomes are are up
and
uh good news for women anyway
is that in 2021 um nearly 60 of college
students were women
so that means that men are moving into
more labor types of jobs which would be
lower paying typically and women are
moving into what could be at least if
they take the right majors higher paying
jobs
and
the article goes on melanie notkin's
article
reporting that it's really hard to find
a woman and one of the speculative
reasons i'm sorry it's really hard for
the women to find a man that they're
willing to let's say marry
because the men earn less than the
women and
traditionally
from an evolutionary
perspective
women have been attracted to men who
have resources
makes sense right because you need
resources to stay alive and
raise babies and stuff like that
so what happens if
if women are the ones making the money
and having the babies which looks like
what's happening
then men are
sort of
kind of don't have a purpose
and so
what happens when women just can't find
men
the the kind of men they want to marry
because the kind of men they can find
are
just they're not they're not killing it
what happens then
i don't know
but some of this could happen
uh somebody's complaining that i made
his penis obsolete
sorry
yeah
and so i think that there is a
definitely a big shift going on i think
the women are becoming men and the men
are becoming women
um and i mean that
in a
hyperbolic but also in a literal sense
that uh the women are becoming more
masculine the men are becoming more
feminine
i don't know what the reason is i don't
know if that's social media or that's
diet or lifestyle or i don't know what
that is but it's definitely happening
when you say wouldn't you say that that
is a very it might be soy it might be
i wouldn't rule that out
um
estrogen in the water somebody says
who knows
i do know that our system of traditional
marriage will probably
become just one option
it already is but i think the
non-traditional marriage
area is going to explode
it's going to be bigger i do not see a
trend back toward traditional marriage i
think we have a one-way trend away from
it it's what i think there will always
be traditional marriages there'll always
be plenty of people who want them but as
a percentage of the total i think it
will
continue to decrease i'm not saying
that's good
i'm not saying i want it to happen i'm
just saying that it looks like that's an
obvious trend
and here's the problem
that i see
imagine 200 years ago there was nothing
to do but work and try to survive
if you married the neighbor's daughter
well you were lucky and that probably
worked out
um but imagine you're in this world
where you have infinite choices it seems
like for everything and you could shop
for a new mate anywhere in the world and
ship them in if if things click
i feel like our pickiness is through the
roof
because we can be picky if you couldn't
be picky then you get over it and you
just all right i guess i'll marry the
neighbor's daughter
um but if you can be picky then you will
be and if we are picky in all of our
other decisions from what app to use to
what clothes to wear to everything
if we become super super picky
i i think marriage is doomed because
you're getting married and then you get
real picky about your spouse and then
it's over
so
i think our pickiness and the
explosion of choices and options
makes marriage essentially obsolete
it'll always be the right solution for
some group of people that'll never
change i don't think
but it's mostly obsolete for most people
pretty soon
i think
um
yeah try getting off the internet and
joining the club you know if i did not
do this for
uh work
i'm pretty sure i would just get off of
social media
i think i mean i don't know i don't know
that for sure but i don't find value in
any social media
beyond the fact that i have a functional
value right here that i it helps me
watch the news and interpret it but if
if i were not doing this
and i were only just trying to
have a job and a family or whatever i
don't think i'd even watch the news
i wouldn't pay attention to anything
except that i do it
professionally uh erica's in the shower
that means that the uh
important part of our presentation is
over
uh you've never had a biological family
so your understanding is less
all right i'm going to try not to go off
on you for that comment
but i really want to
i'll try to do it without going off on
you
it is true that if you don't have a
biological family you can't understand
it
but the concept is people who have not
had a biological family
so everybody i'm talking about is people
who have the same situation as me
which is they have not experienced it
and i would acknowledge that if they did
experience it they would be addicted to
it and they would like it
because when you have a kid you're a
pretty happy advocate most of the time
most of the time you're pretty happy you
did it
so
your comment is
an accurate statement
that i would have a different
appreciation of it if i had a biological
child but that wasn't the topic
the topic was people who haven't done it
and decide not to because it doesn't
work for them
they don't see the benefit
but i agree that if they went ahead and
did it anyway they would find reasons
they liked it they would still get
um
uh
bio dads or donors
uh it's not too late for you you should
try it yeah it's too late for me
um
scott likes to support those who get
censored
do you think that's the same question do
you think me blocking somebody is a
question of censorship
how many people think that
how many think that me blocking trolls
is censorship
because you can still see them right
i only block them from myself
don't i
but you can still see them interacting
i'm not blocking them for you i'm just
blocking them so i don't see them i feel
like that's just me deciding what i want
to look at that's not censorship
my reasons for not having kids are the
same as aocs
does aoc say she doesn't want to bring
somebody into the world because of
climate change
i've never heard her say that
i don't think she says that i'll bet she
doesn't say that that doesn't sound true
all right
uh yeah either go luddite or cyborg
those are your two choices
all right do we need a what uh mini skug
you don't want a little scott
oh the those virginity rocks t-shirts
have nothing to do with preferring
virginity so yeah that's that's a big
brand for the young kids the teens
that there's a brand called virginity
rocks or i don't know if it's a brand or
it's a saying but they have a lot on
their clothing it doesn't mean they like
virginity
that's not what that's saying
they like the brand that's all
all right uh
oh somebody's asking if i could father
aoc's baby
sure
sure
i'm all in
could you could you tell her that the
deal is on and i'll father her baby if
she'd like
no not really not really
not really
do i think that elon has people doing
his tweets for him because they seem so
good
no
because when he talks in person he is
you can just tell his tweets or his like
nobody can write those tweets
you it would be impossible for someone
else to write trump's
good tweets
you know maybe somebody did the boring
ones like announcing something but the
good tweets that trump did there was
those were trump
now i actually saw i stood in the room
and watched trump um assemble a tweet
so i've seen it in real time i've
watched trump tweet
and and uh designed the tweet as i was
standing there
so i know he tweets himself now he
didn't send it
he he dictated it to dan scavito who
presumably sent it
that was trump i was talking about
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you later youtube
see you tomorrow
