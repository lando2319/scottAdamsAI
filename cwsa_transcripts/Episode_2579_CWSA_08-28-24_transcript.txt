show we're going to have today it's
going to be kind of
amazing Today's show will be so
good that I wish I were you so I could
watch me that's how good it will be
[Music]
yeah good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams it's
going to be extra good today I promise
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even comprehend with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cuper mug
or glass a tankered chalice or Stein a
canteen Jer flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine h of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous a
sip and it's going to happen right now
go oh I pity the beverag
less
well little bit of science then a little
bit of politics yeah we'll get to the
chainsaw whale head stories you know the
important stuff but first there's a new
study that says you can use brain
stimulation to block traumatic memories
that's right they will find the place in
your brain where your traumatic memories
are stored and they'll zap it with some
stimulant and whack
it so uh how does that work
though I've got questions I'm trying to
reconcile how could it be that you have
free will but that it's also true that
if you stimulate the brain with
electricity in a certain way it can
change how you
think seems like two things in
Conflict I'd like to give you one
factoid that you can research on your
own there's no such thing as a brain
surgeon who believes in free
will I'm just going to leave that
there that that that's your key to
unlocking the next level of awareness
you got to use the key yourself I gave
you the key now you have the key that
there's no brain suron who believes in
free
will they have to do the
rest well there is a study science
direct is talking about a that says a
high a high carbohydrate diet if you
have a high ratio of carbs It's
associated with an increased risk of
depression
hm eating a lot of carbs is associated
with
depression huh is there any way they
could have saved some money on that
study oh yeah they could have asked
Scott next time next time I could save
you probably several weeks and maybe
tens of thousands of dollars you just
ask have to ask me Scott what do
depressed people do
when they're
depressed well they probably eat because
eating gives you a little boost what do
you think they eat well probably
something that boosts their mood pretty
quickly like a steak well I mean they
might like a steak but what would really
give you like a little you know like you
got a little shot of heroin in your arm
but it's not a heroin a carb a good carb
will do that one of the reasons I don't
carbs is is practically a psych you know
hallucinogenic thing for me you if I if
I eat uh just a bunch of carbs I would
just sit there in a coma after a while
but I'd be happy at first so it does it
make sense that if you carbs you'll be
happy in the short run yes will eating a
lot of carbs make you happy in the long
run everybody knows the answer to that
is no because you're going to get heavy
and it's not going to be good for your
brain so uh yeah you could you could
have skipped the science there just ask
me yeah eating ice cream makes me happy
in the short run how do it work in the
long
run not so
good here is what I call ironic science
and we'll get to the the politics in a
minute ironic science where the thing
you didn't see coming turns out that you
can use a giant bubble of
CO2 to store renewable energy
according to clean uh clean
technicia so apparently they have this
way that they can compress
CO2 and then uh decompress it and
somehow they can store energy and then
release it through the
decompression now imagine if that
becomes a real
thing and that we're
using excess
CO2 to store
electricity from Green energy now I
wouldn't bet very much that this will
become a big thing but how cool is it
that what at least some people think is
our biggest problem the CO2 could be our
biggest
solution I I've have long uh wondered if
we will have a industry where sucking
CO2 out of the air and turning it into
products in this case a battery is going
to be a thing so much so that people are
sucking too much CO2 out of the
atmosphere I think there might be a
point when humans are for just for their
own economic reasons they're sucking CO2
out of the air and turning it into stuff
that they can
sell could be a problem
someday well here's something cool new
outlas is
reporting that uh um there's a new
design hasn't been tested yet uh it's a
startup called Deep
fision and the idea is they would use
regular um Nu nuclear energy technology
not not the generation 4 you know not
the new stuff but rather the stuff that
you would be afraid of if it melted down
but what they would do is they would
drill this ginormous 30inch hole 30 in
wide uh a mile deep and they would put
some kind of mechanism nuclear mechanism
a mile into your hole so to speak and
somehow they would need no mechanical
Parts just two pipes I'm not sure how
this works they they put some water into
it and the water heats up the pressure
of the water is enough to keep things
pressurized so you don't need mechanical
pressure just the weight of the water
that because there's a mile of water and
then I guess the the nuke Cooks it up
and then shoots it back up as I don't
know hot water or steam or
something but the point is you could
actually have nuclear power in a hole
and then if the thing melted down you
just close the
hole Yeah because it would be below the
water table so it would never need to be
you know continually cooled because it
would be below the water table and if
anything went wrong you just leave it
there apparently you can just cover the
hole and walk away now will that ever
become a thing I don't know but how cool
would it be if it did we just drill
gigantic holes and put non-mechanical
stuff in there things that you know
don't need to be revised too much
because it's not mechanical and just
have all kinds of Power well remember
that CEO of telegram the messaging app
got picked up in France there's talk of
you know he's got looking at 20 years of
charges that look suspicious to all of
us um the French are going to extend how
long they're going to hold them let me
tell you everything about this story
that you need to
know you will never know what this story
is about I don't think there's the
slightest chance that you and I will
ever know what this guy was up to and
who wanted him
arrested or any of that probably the
real story is something you've never
even heard right it could be anything so
here's the scary part the telegram CEO
being picked up is more proof that any
government whether a democ or not can
arrest you make up a bunch of
and hold you
forever so if you think that oh it's
good thing I've got this justice system
and all that you really don't we're
we're at a point where the government
can make up any story and hold you as
long as they want
and you know this has the tape Brothers
written all over it meaning you know
maybe the tape brothers did something
that the law doesn't like but I'm not
sure that's why they were
arrested I feel like why whatever the
reason was we'll never know you know
it's some other deep dark reason we'll
just never know so to speculate on this
story seems like a waste of time because
we' just be guessing but the one thing
that is the takeaway is that any
government can arrest any person for any
reason and just make up and keep
them in jail forever that's I think
that's guaranteed and evident and
obvious at this point so it's a scary
world here's a story that shouldn't
bother you a bit over 1 million
ineligible ineligible voters were
removed from the uh Texas voter
logs according to the governor
Abbott and he was bragging about his
election Integrity efforts so thank
goodness thank goodness right
imagine if there had been a million
ineligible voters a million now that
doesn't mean that you know they would
all vote but the the speculation that
some people have is that the ineligible
voters maybe they get a ballot or maybe
somebody pretends to be them but that in
some way somebody's voting those names
without being
them but that's not something you have
to worry about is it I mean we would
obviously
know with our tight election security
you would know if a million people were
going to you know illegally Vote or even
any big number 10,000 10,000 would move
a lot of races but you would know if
10,000 people had voted who were not
legal voters right because our elections
are so
secure there there's no way you wouldn't
know that
right and there's no Kraken that's ever
been
found Am I Wrong nobody ever found a
kraken so there's no reason to believe
that large amounts of you know illegal
voters are voting in the United States
that'd be crazy crazy people who
believes that come on come
on well here's the next story um there's
a claim that there are a thousand ways
to commit election fraud
um Elizabeth Nixon's writing about this
so there's a engineer and data science
Scientist by the way I don't know the
validity of anything that's going to be
in the following story I'm going to
report that it's being
reported I can't tell you it's
true but here's a
report see if it would answer all of
your remaining
questions because it would Mar
if this is true and I don't know that
it's true I'm I'm not selling it as true
I'm selling it as something that's
reported if it's true it answers all of
my
questions now that's the first time that
would have ever
happened because I do say if there were
massive cheating how in the world would
we not know about it you know how could
you really get away with that well
here's a theory I'm just going to read
it to you but again I'm not telling you
it's
true I'm just saying well I got a lot of
questions
now so this uh engineer and data
scientist Kim Brooks she was working on
cleaning the voter roles in
Georgia so isn't that great we got all
these volunteers who are helping making
sure the voter rules do not include dead
people or people who moved away or
people who are not can't vote for one
reason or another so she uh cleaned it
up and uh she'd clear a name let's say
there was a specific name she'd clear it
either because they're dead or whatever
takes it off and then she's pretty happy
it's off it's
off uh but then
uh it would be back within a
month what she would remove it from the
election the election log meaning
eligible to vote and it would be
gone but then it would be back in a
month huh now remember I'm not claiming
any of these reports are true I'm
claiming that there is a
report huh how could that happen how can
you take it off and then it would come
back and so it says at that juncture she
realized that a program within the
Georgia voter registration
database was
methodically adding
back fake
names H so reportedly again I'm not
saying this is true I'm just saying it's
reported reportedly she looked deeper
for new registrant the culprit was
principally Driver Services creating new
registrations and in this case the
manufacturer was a person or persons
in other words there was a person doing
it using a
program within the government office
someone was stealing names and
duplicating even tripling that person's
vote and then forging their
signature sometimes it was someone who
just died or a teacher who had no voting
record in the case of a nurse who died
in
20122 with three
registrations he was registered to vote
in two counties
and all three of her voted in the 2022
election and the 2024
primary each signature was slightly
different and even spelled
different they even even in the
signature they spelled their own name
different three different
ways allegedly and again I'm not saying
it's true I'm just saying it's
reported the operation Works under AVR
or automatic voter registration is being
used to register
migrants they will not vote but their
names have been
entered into the voter registration
database when they apply for a driver's
license and their vote will be voted for
them I imagine that this is uh repeating
something everyone
knows so the allegation is that's why
the border is open to get more of these
non-voters illegally on the voter
roles uh how many states do you think
use this this system this automatic
voter registration system in which one
database would be populating the other
database and massively illegally if the
claim is true how many well the claim is
that in 20 in the year 2020 there are 20
States who use the system
that would
allegedly I'm just saying what is
reported I don't know what's true
allegedly take names from one system
that were not eligible to vote the
driver's license databases and put those
names onto the other system but in the
case of people who were registered two
or three times there must have been
something Beyond just taking new people
and putting them on the the roles must
have been something beyond that so how
many states use that system the one
that's suspected of being the culprit in
these elections
20 there were 20 States who allegedly
used these
systems how many of those did Trump lose
and of 20 states that used that same
system how many did Trump
lose
18 Trump lost 18 of 20
states that use this same system
allegedly now the claim is that there
are these registration fraud
Rings um as identified in the Arabella
document I don't know what that is uh in
the work of Omega for America so there
must have been somebody who looked into
this
and um the idea is that uh every each of
these states has a dozen or more NOS
which do nothing but fill out ballots
for fake
regist
H and Peter bernegger whoever that is
his team in Wisconsin has video of NGO
functionaries doing just that
what at 1:00 am early morning after
election day what I don't know that
that's
confirmed um and Porter reports multiple
schemes using the deceased non-voting
and
Felons blah blah blah they steal an
individuals drivers like license number
Social Security uh blah blah the only
thing that changed is the address and
the
signature generally they use people who
don't vote they change a street number a
county a
signature
huh well what do you think now let's put
this in context all right the first
context is that when the original 2020
susp suspicions were coming out and
there were lots of different claims I
said that whether or not any of these
election rigging claims are true the one
thing you could know for sure is that at
least 95% of the claims would be
debunked was I right yeah probably 95%
of the claims were debunked some of them
are not debunked but not confirmed or
not found by a court or not big enough
or somebody didn't have a standing so
you know there's some gray area stuff
but 95% of the stuff you could
check turned out to be you know not
conclusive now does so what would you
say about this new claim about this one
database that's feeding the other
database is that in the
95% well you don't
know but the caution is that every claim
has a 95% chance of not being true
that's my claim so so this is another
claim that you might say has a 95%
chance of not being true but let me tell
you what's different about
it this is the first time that all of my
questions could be answered which is how
could they do this at a scale and get
away with it if if it's
done if there's massive cheating how can
you get away with it now I had I had
been thinking had something to do with
you know the computer computer code
after the vote is given and maybe there
is something like that but I don't have
any proof of that but this would make
way more
sense if it's true that there are NOS
who are dedicated to putting together
these fake voter
lists that gets me to my next
point we have a
world in which it would
take one whistleblower
just one to change the entire freaking
world because America would be
completely changed by one whistleblower
who actually had the goods you know say
a video or you know said yes I
personally did this this is what we did
to the database if you could get just
one Everything's changed the entire the
entire power structure of the United
States would be altered
forever and of course the United States
affects the rest of the world in a big
way it's a world changing
event one
whistleblower and that one
whistleblower would get rich because
there are going to be some big rewards
and if I were a whistleblower I would
say how big is the reward and they might
say something like we'll give you
$10,000 and then you say if you really
have the goods nope 10,000 ,000 doesn't
even get me interested all right we'll
give you
$50,000 nope not
interested a 100
nope we'll give you a million
dollars
pre-tax or after tax
pre-tax no we'll give you $2 million so
after taxes unless Harris gets selected
uh you'll still have the million left
over well now we're
talking for $1 million I will prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt that I worked
on a team that rigged the election and
that I know where the other NOS are
doing the same thing if that's true
again I don't know that it's true it's
an
allegation so how would you like to be
one of those
cheaters knowing that all of your
co-workers all of your people complicit
allegedly allegedly we don't know that
that's true every one of them could get
a million dollars for turning your ass
in oh it's getting interesting now
people have I been telling you
forever that this movie this reality
we're living in that's way too much like
a movie there is something required that
hasn't happened the movie cannot be
completed until
the Kraken is
found every part of this movie requires
the Kraken to be found after we're sure
that it can't be
found that's what an act three looks
like that's a real act three so I'm
going to double down and say that I
don't
believe that given the current setup the
design of our election going
forward and part of the design is now
The Whistleblower rewards right so The
Whistleblower rewards are now part of
the design of the
system here's things that you could
guarantee without knowing anything if if
somebody drew a system on paper and
brought it to you and said all right
here's here's what we're going to do
we're g to give $100 no questions asked
to everybody who Rings your
doorbell what do you think will happen
and I'd say well once word gets
out I I would imagine it be this huge
line of people people ringing my
doorbell correct now did you have to
test it did you have to actually run a
test no it would be so obvious from the
design that people are going to knock on
your door forever trying to get their
$300 very easy to predict now let's do
it with the
election if you had an election system
was super complicated and it would be
really hard to know if anybody was doing
anything like what was suggested
and the the stakes are
gigantic I mean it's practically life
and death fortune or no fortune I mean
really really high stakes and it's
possible so it's possible and the
incentive to do it is through the roof
it's the biggest incentive you could
ever
have if you if you showed me that on
paper and said what do you think will
happen there's lots of ways to
cheat and the benefit of doing it the
upside is gigant
antic well I would say well on paper
there's going to be massive cheating
there can't really be any other way this
goes now we were told that there really
was no way to cheat without getting
caught if that's true well then I revise
everything I've said but we know it's
not
true if anybody involved in the election
wanted to have a fair election they
would just say hey let's just do paper
ballots and then everybody will stop
bitching right you do the paper ballots
everybody looks at them you can double
count them if you need not double count
but you can recount them if you want to
everybody's
happy and and we know exactly what to do
to get to that point we know that we
want to clean the voter roles it's
really easy to know how to do it legally
is that what's happening no no every
sign that we're seeing especially in
Georgia there's a new Movement by the
Democrats to resist cleaning up the
voter roles why in the world would they
want to resist cleaning up the voter
roles and removing ineligible voters
only one
reason there are not two reasons for
that the only reason is that they plan
to use those dead voters and ineligible
voters to vote what else what else could
it
be give me the other reason no if you
read the reason it'll just be look like
nonsense words put together no there's
only one
reason so on
paper the design of the
system pretty much guarantees massive um
fraud that doesn't mean I have proof of
it it's just that the system design
guarantees
it
and now there's a tweak to the system
design now the system design includes
this new element that wasn't there
before which is knowing in advance that
there will be a whistleblower reward and
probably a big one because remember the
Whistleblower doesn't have to accept the
offered award The Whistleblower can
negotiate if you had the negotiating
which by the way if you're a
whistleblower you should
negotiate don't take the first offer
because you've got this drawing hand
there so
negotiate so if you add negotiating and
whistleblowing
to the current system what does the
design tell you will happen again I'm
not being magic or
guessing I'm saying if you design a
system that very clearly will give you
one outcome what are you going to get
well you going to get that one outcome
it's designed to give it to you all
right our design in 2020 almost
guaranteed a rigged election because it
was possible and the stakes were high
now I don't have proof of that I'm just
saying that that the design guaranteed
that there would be an
effort now we have a design that pretty
much guarantees that at least one
whistleblower will try to get
rich right it's hard to imagine that all
those people who would be willing to do
this illegal thing they're all criminals
every one of them is a criminal do you
think you can trust a criminal not to
take a million dollars to sell you
you can't trust a
criminal so if I take this design and
just fast forward it the design should
give us a result that we don't trust at
the end of the
election it should create a situation
where the government is not willing to
certify it that's our design now I'm not
saying magic will happen I'm saying our
current design guarantees
it right the current design guarantees
rigging it guarantees it by
Design and now that we've got the
whistleblowing thing with enough money
behind it that's a that's a design that
design guarantees a whistleblower even
if they're making it up you know
somebody's going to take a run at it so
the current design pretty much
guarantees we're not going to have a
result by
Design again I'm not saying if this
happens or if this no by Design
we can't get a result this time because
it will be evidence of massive cheating
beyond the margin that would determine
the outcome so my prediction for the
race is no outcome now what what happens
after that is a big black box in my head
I have no idea maybe redo it I don't
know do you keep the do you keep the old
president in charge long enough to fix
something does does the house pick a new
president and then nobody's happy I mean
the whole country would fall apart if
they just said oh Trump's the president
so I don't know what happens but my
prediction is no election no no election
certification so we'll
see
um Harris got community
noted because she said that uh Biden and
I believe that women should make
decisions about their own healthare and
their body not the government and the
community not andx said you required
healthcare workers and big companies in
the military to get Co vac vaccinations
or lose their job that is the opposite
of bodily Freedom so now I'm fantasizing
that the debate happens between Harris
and Trump Harris of course is going to
bring up this you bad Republicans you
want to take away the bodily autonomy
and then Trump
says well you know everything that I did
was to take thec decision away from me
in the federal government and move it
closer to the individuals in the state
and women are the majority voters in
those States so if you can convince each
other what to do with your bodily
autonomy I'm sure the rest of the world
would go along with it but women you
need to decide you need to decide what
it is and I'm sure the system will
support you I know I
do takes the whole abortion thing off
the table and then you do the kill shot
but if if we're talking about bodily
autonomy your team is the one who had
mandatory vaccinations and I would never
do that you know I I was in charge of
making sure you had the option but I
would never make them mandatory because
I would not want mandatory constraints
on your body but you might I mean you
might want to do it on your own in your
States but it's out it's out of my
control and I think you're both happy
everybody's happy that I don't have
anything to control your body everybody
good with that
it'd be a pretty strong argument so I
fantasize about there's new drunk comma
video where she's talking to somebody in
an airport where she looks totally
sosed I'm thinking about Jason from the
Allin pod said that there was an
Evidence you know it was a a dark Maga
claim that she was uh drinking too much
and there's no evidence of it well I
don't know if you seen the compilation
Clips yet but we add this to the
evidence however I'm going to fool you
by saying this one I don't think should
be part of the compilation and the
reason is it looked like she was just
flying in an airport somewhere you know
either on her way or on the way back and
it wasn't official
business I have one feeling if she's
drunk giving a speech in her official
capacity if she was off duty and had a
few drinks in the
plane I can't imagine that would be too
different from presidents we've had
before uh my my concern is if she can't
control it enough that she you know she
can do it on her off time versus you
know work time now I get that if you're
president you still need to be coherent
if you get the 3:00 a.m. call but
realistically we've had drinking
presidents for a long time I just want
it not to be during the
job and if she was is just flying around
I have a different feeling about that
even if even if she was
drunk well the author of a white
fragility one of those books that made
wokeness a big thing um who is herself a
white woman um has been accused of
plagiarizing from Minority Scholars
that's the whole
story the whole story is
that white people are bad apparently she
proved
it anyway Meto Zuckerberg had put in a
statement and he basically admitted that
the Biden Administration pressured them
to censor Co stuff and he and also the
Hunter's laptop stuff and uh maybe some
other stuff and he said it was wrong and
he wished he pushed back and uh he's not
going to be as political or spend his
money the way he did before you know
Shoring up election Integrity thought
but it probably worked the other way um
so he's not going to do that kind of
funding and he's not going to endorse
anybody he's not going to get political
what's that sound like to
you that's a trump
endorsement I'm sorry it's a trump
endorsement he's not going to spend
money to help the Democrats alter
elections the way they had he said that
Trump did the most badass thing he'd
ever seen when he did the fight fight
after he got shot he's seen that the
Democrats are the enemy trying to censor
him and his entire his entire game is
free
communication and they were trying to
ruin most basic thing about his platform
which is some of its honest
and I think you know Zu Zuckerberg he's
one of those people that I love the fact
that you don't have to wonder if he's
being dumb you can just rule that out
you know lots of times when you see
somebody doing something that maybe
isn't what you would do you say oh my
maybe they're dumb you know maybe they
have some clever thing I don't know
about but maybe they're dumb you don't
have to worry about that Zuckerberg
isn't
dumb like we all agree on that right so
I think not endorsing anybody in the
current
environment you're endorsing Trump
that's what it feels like now I'm not
going to put words in his mind and I'm
not going to read his mind so I don't
know that I'm tell you how I feel it
what I feel is that is no longer
necessary to oppose Hitler you know what
I mean if you thought Trump was Hitler
and the other side are the good guys you
kind of have an obligation to to be
against them or at least say the words
even if you don't do things but if
you're not willing to say the words and
you're not willing to do
things at the very
least he doesn't think Trump is Hiller
that's a big deal because I suspect
maybe he did think that because he was
acting like he
did anyway uh so Harris now has changed
her view on having live microphones that
are open during the debate so in other
words Trump's microphone would still be
on while she's doing her talking and
that makes interrupting possible why in
the world would KL Harris
want to invite Trump
interrupting
well here's what I think remember I keep
telling you that uh that she's got this
David plof guy working for her and I
think he might be a genius for all this
stuff because he keeps doing
non-standard things that work such as
why don't we just have her give no
interviews I mean who comes up with that
idea in the first place like who who
even come up with that idea of just not
having her in
public and it works it works so every
time you see somebody come up with a
very non-standard idea and then it just
totally works you're probably looking at
genius if it happens more than
once so now this little bit feels a
little like
genius but maybe desperation too because
you could have them at the same time
I think I think it's obvious that Harris
cannot win a debate against Trump and I
would think that the Democrats know that
but what they could do is make Trump
look like a
bully what they could do is give kamla a
whole bunch of cool onliners to say when
she gets
interrupted it's like sorry I'm talking
now you know that thing so I agree with
the people who say that it's a trap and
that Trump uh Trump won easily over
Biden by not having his microphone on uh
I think that works for Trump when I when
the first time I heard that the
microphones would be off during the
Biden thing I said to myself oh my God
there's no way there's no way Trump
loses the only way Trump can lose is
being so unpleasant you know by
interrupting that people go I don't even
care what your policies are you're just
being a jerk now I hate you so since
it's a Vibe election
if Trump wants to get the right Vibe he
wants to you know visit the Vietnamese
restaurant and show everybody loves him
which he did go to a black barber shop
see that everybody's fine with him he
hasn't done that but he should
but being the nicest Trump is really his
best play so yeah I I think he would be
wise to do what he was doing which is
say well you know we'd already agreed
there would be no microphones let's
stick to it
we'll see what
happens so there was a hearing in
Congress on the Trump assassination
attempt and it featured three really
interesting people so um you had uh Navy
SEAL uh Eric prince who used to run his
own private Army uh for sale and you had
Dan banino and uh Ben chaer he was a
Washington Regional SWAT operator who
was on site that day now those would be
three in my opinion seemingly highly
qualified voices that would tell it the
way it is you know they wouldn't make a
something up and it was fascinating so
there were you know massive evidence of
incompetence which I call the the dilber
filter you know every organization is
incompetent at this point and probably
there was a bunch of stuff that just
looks like incompetence but on top of
that you know unambiguously there was
incompetence but on on top of that there
were questions which don't have an
answer such as cleaning off the roof
prematurely you know uh kind of uh
cremating the body before anybody knew
you know a whole you know what what's up
with the encrypted apps that that guy's
got how did he learn to make a bomb with
a remote that's just made for that just
a whole bunch of
questions that the three of them were
very clear that these are super
important questions and unanswered so I
don't know what it all means but when
the smartest people in the game tell you
there's something that doesn't smell
right I would definitely trust that
right normally you don't you don't trust
doesn't smell right but from these
three if Dan banino tells you something
doesn't smell right in in the domain he
knows
about I'm sure listening to
that so and I I think it's like the
telegram CEO story you'll never know I
don't think there's much any chance at
all that will ever know the truth of
what happened with that guy that Thomas
Crooks assassin
guy well James Carville was on I think
it was CNN and it was talking about RFK
Jr and he said that RFK Jr should be
locked up in a menal institution has no
business being on the street what is
that that would be called
projection and
gaslighting RFK Jr doesn't have any
mental problems are you kidding
me he's he's the most like reasonable
person you'll ever
hear why would uh car will have to say
that well because he he's part of a
party that has a massive mental health
problem and some of us have noticed that
the real problem doesn't seem to be
politics there is a massive mental
health problem and the specific mental
health problem appears to be related to
this dark Triad you know narcissism and
some other things and what they love to
do if they have that particular mental
situation is to project which is blame
other people for what they are or what
they're doing and to Gaslight which is
different from lying I I like to explain
this a lot gaslighting is telling you
that something you're looking at
directly isn't
happening that's not just saying that
yesterday when you weren't there I did
something that lie you can't tell if
it's true or not that's just a lie but
if somebody's looking at something
directly and you say it's not there and
it's just obviously it's there that's
gaslighting because it makes them feel
like am I crazy if you pull it off so
this is gaslighting and I think that's
pretty much all they have left is
accusing Republicans of doing
what Democrats are doing and vice versa
so that's that's an example of that um
KL Harris is also uh once compared
policing just just
policing to lynching and Jim Crow and
now she can't stop bragging about how
strong she is on law enforcement that
would be
gaslighting because we know for sure
that she's not super strong about
policing and she's telling you it's the
opposite so when you know something's
true that she's not the one who is
really for policing and then she tells
you but I'm the one who's really for
policing that's
gaslighting all
right and it will work because Democrats
don't get real news they only see the
the fake news that's in their
Silo here's some news Well Kennedy was
talking to uh Tucker Carlson and it made
quite a bit of news here so he said he
was asked to be on the president's
transition team they would be the ones
who select the people who become part of
the
administration I kind of love this but I
know it's going to cause some trouble
within the Republican party because the
Republicans are going to say wait a
minute why are you picking these people
who are not lifelong Republicans that we
can trust and then Kennedy will say but
but they're really smart and capable and
they're not super political so these are
the ones you want and then the
Republicans will say I don't know
that one person when they were in
college once said something I don't like
so I'm leaning toward this because I do
think that Kennedy could be important in
finding people who are brave and not
political and have the right priorities
that would be kind of fun so I don't see
Kennedy being the one who does the
vetting I see him being you know part of
a vetting system in which you know he
might pick a ex Democrat or a current
Democrat for a few things I wouldn't
worry about that looks positive to
me Tucker asked RFK Jr if he would ever
be willing if asked to become Trump's
CIA
director I love that question and he
said yes I would
what yes I would but I would never get a
senate
confirmation he said he would never get
a senate confirmation because the
intelligence a agencies would just force
the uh the Senate not to confirm him do
you believe that I do I believe that
even if you were asked to be the CIA
director the CIA people would contact
their Congress people they own and say
uh don't vote for this and then they
wouldn't and there's no way they could
become that of CIA I believe that's true
I totally believe
that um
Kennedy says that the reason the
Democrats now hate Free
Speech or at least it looks like it
because they're trying to suppress free
speech in every possible way they can uh
he says it's because the party does not
believe in the
people and that they're making Elon Musk
a villain because he's providing free
speech and uh and he says quote if you
don't believe in free speech it means
because you don't trust the people I
disagree with that I don't think that's
what's going on I don't think that the
Democrat leadership even thinks about
the
people I'm not even sure that's one of
the variables on their top 10 I think
this purely about people keeping their
power and staying in their jobs and
making money I think all the free speech
stuff is purely a power playay has
nothing to do with trusting the people
but I like the fact that k puts his
trust in the
people um I just hope that he doesn't
lose sight of his practical you know his
evil sensing um part of his
brain anyway um so the DNC has
apparently filed a lawsuit against the
Georgia election board to block their
new rule so the Democrats don't want
Georgia to clean up the accuracy of
their voter gos you I mentioned that
before what would be their reason only
one reason there's only one reason you
would vote against cleaning up your
voting roles there's not a second reason
you all would you all
agree there's not even a second reason
that's
offered because what it's probably just
word soup it's you know nothing that
even makes
sense so there's
that here's something else uh or K Jr
said in the Tucker interview he said he
was originally not interested in working
with Trump but his wife Cheryl uh asked
him to hear Trump out now I saw Raheem
Kasam saying that an X I haven't seen
the news story itself but do you think
that's
true do you think it was Cheryl who
asked him to hear Trump
out so you know weren't you wondering
like how that marriage works
weren't you you were right you're like
how's that work it seems like they're
just too different I don't see how in
the world they can reconcile that but if
this is true and by the way RFK Jr has
shown you know no propensity to lie
about anything that I've seen so the
fact that he says is true seems very
likely it's true just the fact he's
credible if that is true then that
suddenly puts his wife in a whole whole
different frame and a positive one not
because she might you know be
a
um uh just got a message from zubie
that's interesting I'll have to contact
him a
later so
uh yeah anyway so it makes me it makes
me think that uh his wife Cheryl is
maybe a more complicated person than the
news that indicated and more supportive
and maybe more
wise uh but clearly she's supportive and
wise if this if this is right and I
think it is Nicole Shanahan you know RFK
Jr's VP running mate while he was
running put on a ven diagram which is
funny because you know ven diagrams but
it showed a ven diagram of Occupy Wall
Street that would be the you know the
Democrats who didn't like large
corporations and the tea part which was
Republicans who didn't like big
government and she says that
uh that her movement if you can call it
that is uh the
intersection so the intersection of
people who don't like big government and
the people who don't like big
corporations is when the big government
and the big corporations are colluding
with each
other and I thought wow that just that
hits it perfectly you know you could
call it fascism but then nobody knows
what that word means but if you show it
in the ven diagram you're like oh yeah
the big corporations have too much power
but some like that the big government
has too much power but other people are
happy with that but when you look at the
intersection when the two of them are
working together that the big
corporations are bribing the government
and the government's doing stuff with
the big corporations that you don't like
it is the when they work together that
it's a problem and that's where we can
all come together how about less of that
well you heard the story about uh RFK Jr
allegedly I think it's true uh he used a
chainsaw to cut off the head of a dead
whale and put it on his car and he tried
to take it home and it was oozing whale
juice uh and I guess he had some
fascination with skulls and he he was
going to do something to get a wh whale
skull which I kind of love CU I mean the
whale was dead and uh a huge whale skull
like if you could
you know get a whale skull and clean it
up and you know put it on a display in
your house how cool would that
be I mean seriously if you had a giant
whale SK skull and you had some way to
display it it'd be kind of cool so I
don't know what he was up to but it
doesn't matter it was just something he
wanted to do so axios is reporting that
there's now this environmental advocacy
group that wants some investigated
because it might be illegal to transport
a dead uh a Dead mammal's
skull so there must be some law that
says you can't transport a Marine Mammal
skull come
on come on who even knew that was a
law come
on so uh I think it's not only uh
fascinating that somebody tried to
transport a dead whale's head I find it
fascinating that there's a law that
covers that specific situation but even
more
ironic here it comes here it
comes remember this was a environmental
advocacy group that was going after him
so is it ironic that an environmental
advocacy group would turn themselves
into garbage
I don't even think you could recycle
that kind of garbage no these are
garbage people because if they decided
that they looked at the whole world and
all of the environmental problems and
they said you know what if we could
solve this aquatic mammal skull
Transportation problem well then we'd
have a better world to live to leave to
our children wouldn't we no they are
garbage
and so the very thing that they're
trying to have less of they
became meanwhile Harris has a tax plan
that would absolutely rape the rich uh
top uh top rate for individuals would
climb to
44.6 which if you add your California
tax on gets uh well over
50% um the other rates are just through
the
roof if you're a wealthy person and
you're supporting Democrats you're a
idiot you're a
idiot Mark Cuban if you support this
you're a idiot and I don't think
he does I mean I don't know what's going
on with him he's playing some kind of
playing some kind of strategy that I
don't fully understand so it's hard to
hard to judge it but nobody's in favor
of this who has money
nobody you I don't think you could find
one wealthy Democrat who would be down
for this and let me tell you where my
red line
is I pay roughly 50% in
taxes if if you've never experienced
that and much more if you throw on
property taxes and sales tax and stuff
so you know maybe 60% of my money goes
to taxes if you put it all together
um it's too much
you know there's some point where I say
you know what my taxes are outrageous
but I get that people doing well pay
more I mean that the concept itself
doesn't stress me too much but at some
point it's just abuse and it just feels
like punishment because I don't think
it's for the benefit of the country it
just feels like punishing people who
made money and here's my
deal I already made this money with the
old rules
if you're just going to take it
from me which is what this is It's just
confiscation they're they're actually
talking about just taking the money that
you have if you have too much just take
it
um this is move out of the country
stuff th this is literally sell the
house move to Costa Rica I'm not going
to pay more than 50% in taxes and you
know the billionaires would be crazy to
stay here
crazy so we'll see what happens I don't
I don't think most of it's likely to
happen but it's probably a good solid 30
to 40% likely it's just
horrible anyway I would think it would
bring a few more prominent Democrats to
Trump because it's
crazy uh Trump says he wants to build a
create a space National Guard and build
an iron Dome missile system around the
US yes we need that for sure um I think
I saw Elon say it it was time to start a
Starfleet
Academy literally we're going to have a
Starfleet I mean it won't be you know
the whole world in Starfleet like the
real Star Trek but yeah we need a
Starfleet Academy for our space Army
that's coming meanwhile tulsey gabard
apparently is endorse jump I thought she
hadd already done it so I kind of missed
that story but I guess it's she had not
officially endorsed him and now I would
say that the uh Royal Flush is
complete remember I was telling you that
if feels like Trump is assembling a
poker hand of a royal flush and he
needed a
queen right after I said he needed a
queen telsey Gabbert
endorses I guess he got his Queen so now
he now he has the uh the full Royal
Flush now you could argue you know who
who's the king and who's the ace you
know Trump's the Ace of course but uh
well maybe maybe Trump's the king and
Ark is the Ace because the ace is
sometimes one but sometimes 11 well
that's only in if you're if you're
playing a different
game so uh yeah he's got a royal
flush and uh or the other way to look at
it is he's his pirate ship is nearly
staffed um
I I saw um Greg geld mentioned the
pirate ship analogy and he was nice
enough to credit me on that and
uh- which by the way I don't
require I I like it when my ideas get
used by anybody I don't know if I've
ever told you that directly so anybody
who wants to take anything I've said and
say it with or without
credit I'm okay with that like I'm I'm
not in it for the credit I don't I don't
work that way
so anyway the pirate ship is about
staffed here what I love about the
pirate ship is that if forgives a lot of
uh rough edges because there could be a
lot of people on the same team who've
got their own rough edges and if you
call them Pirates and you say well we're
at least on this pirate ship on the same
Mission together it sounds a lot better
than it's a whole bunch of people with
flaws so there's something about the
pirate ship analogy that just totally
works for me I think it's that bad boy
thing and now a bad girl because we got
tulsy on
board I also love the framing that RFK
Jr's done um with make America healthy
again make America great again you could
you could see why the left bristled at
it because they're like great again why
are you saying it was so great back when
there was slavery now that's not what
anybody was thinking but it was easy to
twist that into something bad so they
did so I personally I've never been an
embracer of magga I talk about it and I
like the people who are part of it but I
don't I didn't like it associated with
me personally you know even though the
the Press likes to associate me it's
just I didn't like the word I don't like
how it sounds it sounds too much like a
magot too easy to turn it into something
negative so I was never on board with
maggus since the beginning although I
would acknowledge it became a
gigantic successful branding thing so
you could argue that Trump got it right
because it was so successful however
when you hear make America healthy again
oh my God is that
hit make America healthy again refers to
not just our our systems and our our
election process and how we select
people and you know what we do in the
world I mean we need way more Health in
our
systems but physically we're dying we're
just physically less healthy and it's a
big big big problem and I think RFK Jr
with make America healthy again found a
way that everybody can
agree because not everybody's going to
want to make America great again because
they think that's moving backwards which
by the way uh KL Harris is cleverly and
again this has to be plof I guarantee
you this is David ploof uh she's saying
that Trump is taking you backwards and
she wants to take you forwards how good
is that as
persuasion well it's so good that I once
taught Bill Clinton how to do it because
remember how he took uh he he might not
know I was behind it but uh the the idea
that uh Bob Dole was you know taking you
to the Past CU he was saying hey you
know I'm the great generation let's get
back to those old ideals it made it easy
for Clinton to say well you're taking us
to the Past I'm going to take you to the
Future that is always the winning play
I'll take you to the Future always beats
I'll take you to the Past even if the
past looked pretty good nobody wants to
go back to the past it's just nobody so
K Harris once again has a perfect frame
which is that they're about the future
and Trump wants to make you this again
guy oh you want do again you mean the
past ah I see so you're taking us back
to when you know nobody can have an
abortion and you know there were slavery
and Jim Crow oh you want that again too
easy to mock but what do you do with
make America healthy again oh I'd like
to go back to when we were less healthy
no that's One
Direction you know even though you say
again you know that we're less healthy
so nobody argues that we were healthier
in the past nobody has that
feeling so that's good
um RFK Jr on climate change because I
know this is where a lot of Republicans
are going to say wait a minute I
disagree with you RFK Jr because you're
Pro climate change but I didn't know
exactly what his nuanced thinking was
but here's something that would make you
a little bit happier he said Democrats
have become subsumed in this carbon
Orthodox uh meaning that the only issue
is carbon and it's the thing that
they're going to measure for everything
so if you're
measuring carbon that's what you'll
manage to have I told you a million
times that you can only manage to things
you measure so if let's say there were
three things you thought were good ideas
but one of them you could measure and
you did measure that's where all your
attention would go because you can
measure it as soon as you can measure a
thing it just sucks all the energy to it
cuz Okay you can tell if I make a
difference so he's saying that the
concentration on that may be diverting
from some better things you could do you
know to just make the environment
cleaner that may have nothing to do with
CO2 uh but then he goes further so I I
can't follow him on this part of the
journey but I appreciate it he said uh
the reason that we protect the
environment is because there's a
spiritual connection
so it's not just the CO2 stuff he says
there's a spiritual connection and when
we destroy nature we diminish Your
Capacity to sense the
Divine
[Music]
um uh I love the way you put it so in
terms of poetry and you know verbal
capability it's through the roof you
know it's it's standard Kennedy how the
hell did you say this so well stuff um
so it's impressive in that way and
probably hits people just what they want
I'll give you the uh the less religious
version of
this that we don't feel complete until
we can go outside in a nice environment
that's
outdoors and I completely agree with
humans can't be humans until they can
experience a clean
environment and I would argue that maybe
you know a lot of inner city um problems
might have to do with not having access
to
Nature let me ask you this if I said you
could never go into nature again you'd
only be in an inner city that's sort of
dirty and squalid what would that do to
your
brain it would kill
you yeah the best part of my day every
day is even though my dog's got three
good legs and one limpy one uh I take
care to the Park and I simply stand in
this park under these trees it's a just
the greatest Park tiny little Park it's
only just a few Acres you can see the
whole park from any part of the park
but it's
extraordinarily
nourishing I simply stand there and I
feel like like these needles just went
into my arm and they're giving me like
happiness instantly I get out of the car
I walk 10t and my entire body just
goes and stays that way until I get back
in the car and then there's some you
know lasting benefit for that during the
day imagine if you never had
that that would probably explain a whole
bunch of people in inner cities never
they just never see the beach you know
or maybe once every you know three
months or something um that would make
you crazy so I don't think you have to
call on the divine
you could simply say that what makes a
human a human and a complete human
absolutely requires some kind of commune
with nature on a regular basis and you
can't get around it so I'm completely
with them you know with a
tweak well let me compliment president
Trump uh I've been I've been wishing he
would do something in a specific way for
the longest time I think I've said it a
number of times
and
finally he did
it now I hope you understand how
powerful this is so he was on a podcast
I wish I remember the name of the host
he's somebody who does a really good job
but uh he was asked about the uh hoax
that he had once said that the military
are suckers and
losers now as you know there was one
General who claims he said that then As
Trump said there were 26 people who said
it didn't happen but if somebody says
you did something and you say no I
didn't are they convinced no they're not
that the argument it didn't
happen it just sounds like a lie because
if people want to think you did it no I
didn't well there's somebody who says
you did and it's a general
so right so here's how he answered
it he said who would say it a stupid he
I think he said that three three times
who would say it you who would say that
who would say that and then he answered
his own question a stupid person or one
who was mentally
ill that's
it that's the
one that's the
one that's the one I wanted to hear who
would do this that works with the fine
people hoax who would stand in front of
the the country as the president in
prepared remarks at least you know
mentally prepared remarks and and say
that neo-nazis are fine people the
answer is no one no one that's how you
should have known it was a hoax without
needing to check that the video was in
fact edited who would stand in front of
the world and say maybe you should drink
bleach or inject bleach or inject a
household disinfectant into your body
no one no one not Trump not anybody
unless they were quote stupid or
mentally
ill who would say in front of a
general that soldiers were uh suckers
and losers no one no one would say it
but putting it in the form of a question
is the stronger form of persuasion if
you just say no would say it is not
nearly as good as who would say
that I'm just think about it just use
your common sense who would ever say
that in
public first of all who would believe
it yeah who would believe it but that
even if somebody believed it who would
say
that that the who would say it is the is
the one that unlocks the brain of the
brainwashed okay you do have a good
point there because it's not a statement
it's a question and if you can't answer
the question you're going to have to
figure out why you can't answer it who
would say that exactly once you see the
pattern that three of the biggest hoaxes
I would argue the three most powerful
hoaxes were from Trump were were about
things that nobody would say so yes
president Trump you are powering up for
this debate in a way that is making me
very happy I I feel like who again I'll
say it whoever is advising Trump right
now doing a good job there there's
something good happening
there all right here's a little story
that is just interesting apparently we
used to think that old trees couldn't
absorb any CO2 so old growth forests
weren't going to help too much for
fighting climate change but now there's
new information that says that the old
forests actually grow new Woody biomass
and do absorb so my question is this
when you're putting together those
climate models and you get wrong the
fact that existing old forses can in
fact absorb CO2 how much did that change
your
model did they did they go and revise
all their models well probably not
because you know this is one maybe one
study maybe they need to see some more
before they're
convinced um
but I I remind you that when you have a
model that has you know I don't know
hundreds of variables or whatever there
are that it doesn't take much change to
even one of those variables to get a
wildly wrong answer and that's why
people who have never done any kind of
predicting or modeling don't really
understand how bad the models are
models are not
real they're all fake and the way they
do it is they throw the one throw away
the ones that don't work this year they
add another one and then they tell you
models work know what works is if you
throw away the ones that don't work and
replace them with a new one it will
always look like the models are working
it's literally nothing but a trick and
the entire scientific Community are
 idiots when it comes to any kind
of magic tricks or how how they get
fooled they're brilliant people I mean
it's hard to be a scientist without
being brilliant but they are notoriously
easy to
Fool in some cases because they're a
little bit too literal I guess there may
be something to it but scientists tend
to be easy to
fool with
scams
um so there's a report that the US is
helping Israel uh hunt down the head of
Hamas that y Yaya sinir
guy the most simulation sounding name in
the world
sinir war and uh did you know that we
have a we have a technology that's this
deep penetrating um radar or sonar I
forget what it is that they can map out
the uh the
tunnels so apparently the US has some
kind of attch where they can actually
just map the tunnels
did did you know that was
true I wish I knew about that a long
time ago so if they've got complete
control of the territory which they seem
to and they can map out the tunnels it's
only a matter of time before they you
know get everybody they need to get but
uh apparently we're doing a lot and the
story is that the US wants to find
senoir and take him out because they
think that would be
um the administration American
Administration Biden uh believes that
that would give Israel a reason to say
the war is over so the war doesn't have
an over Point there's just sort of more
of what you're doing like it would be
hard to identify well what would be the
end of the
war what's the end and so you could sort
of artificially have a fake because I've
taught you that if people want to do
something but they they can't come up
with a reason but they want to do it and
that's that's this people want to have
an end to the
war but they don't have a reason they're
going to need a reason then the war so
from a persuasion perspective the fake
because the reason that you use to do
your thing because you wanted to do it
anyway but you needed something that
sounded like a reason would be that
sinir gets captured or
killed now in my view
that makes no difference to anything
because I just replace him with number
two and go on but in the fake because
persuasion
World it might be a strong argument that
the public thinks well you got the head
guy it's a time to wrap things up so I'm
not entirely sure that that's what the
us is thinking it's just reported that
that's what they're thinking maybe a lot
of people thinking different things in
the
administration but uh just know that we
now have the tech to pretty much capture
all of those tunnels or most of them or
a lot of
them all right that's what I got for you
today that is the end of my prepared
remarks I'm going to talk privately to
the wonderful
sexy good-look people on locals
subscribers and for those of you on X
and YouTube and Rumble thanks for
joining and uh I got lots of fun coming
up in the next few weeks I'll let you
know about lots of things happening but
until then I'll see you tomorrow the
rest of you but locals hang in with with
me I'm going to have a extra sip of
coffee to wrap things up and then it
will be locals
alone
