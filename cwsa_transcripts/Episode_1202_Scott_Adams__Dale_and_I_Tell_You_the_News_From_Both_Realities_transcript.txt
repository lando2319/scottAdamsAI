[Applause]
hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time it's time for a
coffee with scott adams
best part of the day now i gotta tell
you that the sunday after thanksgiving
is just about the sleepiest day of the
year
but we're gonna dig deep and find some
fun here today
in all of the boringness but first
in order to enjoy it to its full full
full extent all you need is a
copper margarita glass of danger
chelsea's inaccurate drug a flask of
vessel of any kind
so with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including recounts
it's called the simultaneous tip that
happens now go
so good so there's a really interesting
chess game going on in the middle east
and i hate to be fascinated by
war and death but
it's hard not to be you know if you're a
human
you've always got these you know two
thoughts going on well that's horrible i
hope there's less of that
i don't want any death and destruction
over there but on the other hand
it's really interesting which is not
really uh
not really fun somebody said it's
the scott sophistry hour
anybody who who accuses you of sophistry
that's that's one of the dumbest
the one one of the dumbest criticisms i
don't even need to say more about that
it's just dumb
usually when they accuse you of
sophistry is because they
they don't agree with you it doesn't
mean i'm wrong
um anyway talk about the middle east
so as you know there was a uh
assassination of a the top iranian
nuclear scientist guy everybody assumes
it's israel but the timing is the
interesting part because
if biden goes ahead and takes office as
many people assume will happen this
really
throws a little uh wrinkle into it
doesn't it because what is iran going to
do
here's the clever part does iran
just ignore it because if they do
there'll be more of it right there'll be
more more targeted assassinations i
assume
more things will blow up and that sort
of thing
but what if they what if they retaliate
if they retaliate they either retaliate
weakly you know in a weak way that makes
no difference
so what's the point or they tell you
they retaliate
strong what would happen if they did a
strong retaliation
when biden is trying to figure out how
to
maybe get back into the iran peace deal
it would really make it hard for biden
to make
any kind of uh overture for peace or an
agreement with iran
so i think if if we assume as everybody
assumes that israel
was behind it let's call that a
safe assumption baseless oh it's
baseless
i have not seen any not one piece of
evidence
certainly nothing's been proven in court
so i think we could all agree that the
allegations that israel is behind that
assassination
baseless by definition because there's
no evidence
right don't you know that if something
is baseless then i guess you have to
treat it like it didn't happen
because it's baseless now i have argued
of course
that there are some situations which are
so
obvious that you don't really need too
much proof
do you how much proof do you need
that israel israel was behind that
assassination
would you be willing to make decisions
and act upon
your belief that israel was behind it
while knowing it's baseless i thought we
didn't do that
can you act upon something with no
evidence
just because you know that the the way
the situation
is constructed there really is sort of
only one person who could have been
behind it if you know what i mean
it wasn't estonia
estonia gets a free pass and all of this
stuff don't they
so uh we'll watch that but it looks to
me that
israel has made the right chess
move because if you're the second in
command
of the nuclear program in iran
you're not so effective today
i don't think you're doing much
communicating with your staff
if you're the number two nuclear guy so
at the very least it's going to make
things less efficient over there
all right um
let's talk about something else so
i tweeted today my minimum requirement
for unity with democrats
now democrats are calling for unity some
of them anyway
and i i like the
i like the concept of unity and i like
anytime a national leader calls for
unity
we should take that pretty seriously and
i think that the united states should
have as its very strong goal
to be unified of course you need a
system to get there
but here is what i would um recommend
in order to get good with somebody it
helps
if you tell them what it would take
because you don't want somebody who's
trying to
find some unity with you just guessing
what you need
right it could it just isn't very
efficient for the other person to say
okay i want some unity with you
i'd like to get along i'm gonna guess
what it would take to do that why make
them guess
why not just say look i'll be okay with
you
under the following conditions you know
i'll still hate your policies and will
still argue about politics
but i'll be okay with you as a citizen
as a person
i'll be okay with you under the
following conditions
and here are my conditions now it's not
the only things that have ever bothered
me
i'm just saying it's the only things i
need sort of the minimum
to to think about unity
and my minimum requirement is that the
democrats apologize
for the fine people oaks the drinking
bleak hoax
and the russian collusion oaks which
they like to confuse with russian
interference which actually did happen
and of course i'm using a little
persuasion trick
do you recognize it what persuasion
trick am i using
maybe more than one let's see how good
you are at spotting them now i've been
training you for
for a few years i'll read it again
and then you tell me what persuasion
trick
yeah laundry list is one of them but
there's another one i'm going for
all right see if he can catch it my
minimum require for unity with democrats
is an apology
for the fine people oaks drinking bleach
oaks and the russian collusion oaks
somebody says high ground no
it's uh i see why you're saying high
ground but that's not what i was going
for it's
thing he passed the sale that is correct
very good
most i'm seeing in the comments uh
most of you are actually getting the
right answer do would you have gotten
that answer before i started talking
about this
thinking pass the sale thing would you
have all spotted that
because i'd like to think that i set
your filter so that you can spot it now
all right so it is a persuasion trick
to make them think about the apology
for the hoaxes it makes them think past
the question of
hey were these things real or were these
things hoaxes
now they were hoaxes i'm not trying to
fool people
into thinking something untrue i'm
trying to persuade them into thinking
something that's true
that is real you know it's closer to
reality than whatever they were
imagining so it i would say that this is
ethical persuasion manipulation
is a word that i would use for unethical
persuasion
where you're persuading something that's
good you're persuading other people
to do something that's good for you but
maybe not so good for them
that's manipulation but regular
persuasion where you're getting people
to do things that are good for them and
good for you
i would say that's just leadership all
right
and of course this uh triggered a bunch
of people to say
what do you mean find people hoax i saw
it myself
on tv he said it i heard it with my own
ears
and i'm taking a new technique with
those people
my old technique was let me show you my
evidence
here's the transcript here's my argument
for why it's a hoax
as you've witnessed i've been doing that
for years with almost
no success almost
no success in simply presenting an
argument with facts
and really clear facts ones which they
can check
oh here's the transcript now i see that
i only saw the first part of the
transcript
now that you've showed me the second
part i can see it's a hoax
but when i only saw the first part i was
convinced i saw everything i needed to
see
and then i was fooled all right so that
never worked you would think that would
be the most
obvious thing that would work right i
believe something incorrect
well let me give you incontrovertible
proof that you can check yourself in
five seconds
you can google it yourself just look for
yourself
in five seconds i can show you a fact
that disproves your original thought
didn't work not ever
[Laughter]
so here's the new technique
when somebody makes that claim he did
say it i saw it with my own eyes
i retweet it and i tell the world there
are still people who think this happened
there's still people who believe this
and boy does it trigger them
of course they go crazy because you're
calling them out to embarrass them
for a fake memory which they still think
is
true and so they're going to start to
defend their false memory
which they can't it's not it's not
possible because it didn't happen
and here's what here's the new trick so
the new trick
compared to the old track the old
technique was i would show them the
transcript
and make my argument and never worked
the new one is this
i say if you believe it happened i
challenge you to go find the transcript
and paste it in the comments and of
course
they think uh what kind of trick is this
are you telling me that if i go get the
transcript myself
i'm going to debunk myself and of course
they don't believe that
and the first thing that they will do
predictably is go get
the fake transcript which is the first
half
where they leave out trump's
clarification that was unprompted
that modifies what he said so you're not
confused
if you only see the top half you are
confused that's why he
clarified it so
that's the first thing they'll do is say
here it is here's the transcript
i win i said he said it in public
there's the transcript i've won my case
and then you say
no it isn't that's not the transcript
now go back and find the whole
transcript now the reason that i do this
is because it is impossible to talk
somebody into
believing something they thought they
saw with their own eyes
but it might be possible to get them to
talk themselves out of it
you have to make them work because if
you do the work and say here's the
transcript just read it
that just never works because they're
just automatically in
defensive mode but if you make them do
the work on their own
you go find me the transcript no that
wasn't it
nope nope you did not find the
transcript yet you found the fake one
now go back and find the rest of it
because even you can see that wasn't the
last
thing he said i mean you can tell from
the the excerpt that's not
done so we'll see if that works i'll
report in later but it looked like it
was making an
effect all right uh i'd like to read
to you uh two versions of the news
okay one version uh
let's say the two movies on one screen
version of the news and it's about the
pennsylvania
legal challenges and it goes like this
first i'll give you the news from the
let's say the right the news is there
are lots of irregularities
and uh constitutional violations in the
pennsylvania election
and is working itself through the legal
system and we have some indication from
the supreme court
that they're likely to agree and throw
out a bunch of votes
so pennsylvania is looking good not only
that but a couple dozen
state legislators have said that they
don't trust
the certification of the election pretty
good source right
pretty good all right
somebody just reminded me to put my ring
back on thank you
here's the second version of the news
pennsylvania they keep trying these
lawsuits and they keep getting kicked
out
why because there's no evidence there's
no proof
there's no proof there's no evidence
pennsylvania lawsuits
no chance it's over it's dead and done
it's buried and it's a hundred feet in
the ground
it's covered with dirt it's covered with
gravel it's covered with
nuclear waste that's how far in a hole
the legal challenges are there is no
hope
no hope in the world cannot be done
the constitution and in fact physics
itself makes it impossible you can't
change
time reality is set nothing can happen
the election is over over over over
over and then the other news
looks like when it goes to the supreme
court
things are going to go pretty well over
trump
both of those news
somebody says in the comments why is
dale wearing your wedding ring
what do you like to know
and so i'm trying to figure out what is
real
what is real let's take the let's take
the fact that
i think 26 state legislators from
these republicans from pennsylvania now
have
no uh no confidence in the vote
so is 20 26 a lot
if 26 gop legislators say they're
not confident is that a lot because the
first time i saw the news it was
out of context as in
uh is 26 a lot ima
just if you want to know how completely
incompetent
the news business is imagine that you as
a consumer heard this news
26 republicans are questioning the
credibility of the election
what did that tell you nothing
because you don't know how many
legislators there are do you how many of
you knew
how many legislators there are i didn't
how many how many
how many legislators are there in
pennsylvania
oh beats me don't have an idea
now how many of the the answer is there
are 203 seats
so that would be 26 and and of 203
so i think somebody did the math for me
here in the comments and said 11
so are you done it's only 11
you can kind of ignore 11 can't you
or can you is 11 a lot
or is 11 nothing because it's not a vote
right if it were a vote 11
would be nothing if it were
a number of people who are going to die
from coronavirus
11 would be sky high you'd be
like that'd be the end of civilization i
think
not quite but it's 11 percent
oh oh it's not really 11 let's modify
this a little bit
because there are only 113 republicans
do you expect that there would be any
democrats
no matter the information no matter the
data
no matter the evidence do you believe
that any democrats
would say the election was not credible
once they've won all right is it
reasonable to
think that any of the democrats could
possibly be
honest even if they believe the election
was
fake no so i think if you're going to be
reasonable and say
okay how much of a big deal is this 26
legislators and a 203 you have to
subtract the democrats
because the only group that matters are
the group that
could change their mind if you've got a
group
that you know with a high degree of
certainty
it doesn't matter what the facts are
they're not going to use the facts to
make any kind of decisions here
they're going to use politics they won
now re
reverse the situation let's say
republicans had won
and the democrats were thinking of
challenging the credibility of the
election
would you expect even one republican
if they had won to question the
credibility of an election
that they won no
quite obviously that would be zero
you know is anybody doubting that do i
need to
do i need to give you proof that if the
republicans had won the election
that they wouldn't be questioning the
credibility
because i've been told that nothing can
be true or known until you have proof
i don't have any proof how can i prove
that republicans would act like human
beings act
every single time human beings are in a
certain kind of situation
now forget about republicans it's the
democrats
that are the human beings in this
specific situation
who have won and defeated
orange hitler it's not just winning
it's not like winning a softball game
they defeated
orange hitler is there any reasonable
chance
that that group the winners are going to
say yeah maybe
rethink this maybe we should open up the
possibility that orange hitler would
become our leader again
no no you don't need any
evidence you don't need any proof those
democrats
are simply not relevant to the question
of whether the election was credible
they don't have any value to the
decision
so take them out so now it's 26 out of
113 republicans
ooh what's 26 and of 113
alexa what is 26 divided by 1136 divided
by 113 is approximately 0.2301
23 if 23
of the legislators who could change
their mind
in other words they're the only ones who
have even a possibility
of saying yeah i think this election is
not so good
23 23
is enough it's what it's way enough
it is completely enough because if the
game here is to get the house
and you're gonna have to fact check me
on some of the constitutional
ins and outs here but i think that if
uh the house looks at these legislators
and sees that nearly a quarter of them
think the election was thrown
that would give them enough cover to say
there's too much doubt
right how much reasonable doubt does the
house
need in order to say you know i think
we're just going to make our own
decision
and ignore the election what is the
quantity or percentage or however you
want to
measure it of how much doubt
if this were a legal case how much doubt
would you need to get somebody off
who had been accused it wouldn't take
much
maybe 10 percent doubt 5 percent doubt
how much doubt would it take to find
somebody innocent
even if there was a lot of evidence but
there was still a ten percent
doubt you would let them go
wouldn't you now what if it was a 20
doubt well then i think you would
definitely let them go
could you imagine convicting somebody if
you felt in your own mind there was a 20
doubt you wouldn't you wouldn't even
come close to convicting them
you wouldn't even consider it because
you're a reasonable person
right so i think that pennsylvania
at least in terms of the republican
goals here
i think they accomplished what they
wanted to and it's probably still not
done because i think it goes to the
supreme court now
at least one of the challenges about a
rule change now one of the rule change
one of the reasons that i guess is the
the pennsylvania court
the high court said that the legal
challenge in which
they challenged a 2019 rule change
about mail-in ballots so the challenge
was to get rid of those votes
that had been the subject of that rule
change because
the change came from the court and not
the legislature i think that's the
nature of it
and therefore the change was
unconstitutional
so it got challenged and this is why the
court
rejected that challenge
because of the doctrine of
latches or laches
h e l-a-c-h-e-s have you ever heard that
word before if you're not a lawyer
if you're not a lawyer have you ever
even heard that word
have you ever heard of the doctrine of
latches or laches or
somebody says latches i don't know how
to pronounce it oh thank you
in the comments they're saying it's
latches so the doctrine of
latches doesn't have a t in it but lach
and here's what that means i have to
look it up and what it means
in uh just ordinary talk
not legal talk is that you waited too
long
and if you wait too long to accuse
somebody of something
there's an implied a disadvantage
for the accused and i think there's also
uh an assumed uh just a fairness and
appropriateness
and it's sort of subjective right
so the the thought is that you've waited
too long to make your claim
and therefore we can ignore the claim
so the claim was ignored because they
said
you didn't miss a deadline this is the
important part there was no
deadline to make the claim per se
in terms of a law or a statute or
anything like that
it was just felt by the court that has
seemed
too long now
remember i told you that the court will
rule on your
feelings sometimes
more than they will rule on the letter
of the law
so i think this is one of those clear
cases where they said
it would seem inequitable and unfair and
it would disenfranchise voters
if we do this so we're not even going to
look at the claim
that it was unconstitutional
how do you how do you describe what i
just described
other than saying they put feelings
ahead of the law
and i believe that this is a common
thing not an
uncommon thing rather that the court
does
sometimes say what's best for the world
in our opinions we're the judges
so we get to be a little subjective
what's best for the world
and sometimes judges think what's best
for the world
is to ignore the law that ignore the
constitution
i would argue that abortion
rights are an example of that i would
argue that
uh you know the supreme court kind of
made up a right
i know people on the right to believe
this you know the privacy or whatever it
is
sort of crafted a law out of nothing and
said ah it's sort of there
if you look hard enough i think that was
just an example of the supreme court
saying that in their in their opinion at
the time
that the world was better
ignoring the law you know or just making
up a law of their own
if you will so it's not that uncommon
but there you go i would say that the
odds of something like that
getting overturned by the supreme court
i'm no supreme court expert
but i would think this whole uh doctrine
of latches just looks like to
me
looks like to me but we'll see
all right um
i said yesterday that i'm going to start
giving out compliments
to various entities especially
especially entities and people
that i have criticized in the past so
it's just a holiday thing
i'm going to complement people and
things and entities that
i had been tough on in the past here's
an example have you seen
any photos of the new ford bronco
i was pretty brutal about ford when i
was trying to buy a ford truck and it's
just
a hard process but oh my god the new
ford bronco
it's redesigned that thing is beautiful
now i don't know you know what roof use
is going to get i don't know how it is
order
you know automotively and all that
but i am so
glad to live in the country with a
company
like ford american company that can
build such a beautiful product
i think the same thing about apple all
the time you know i criticize
apple about various things but man you
can't
you got to give it up for their design
their design is
beautiful this ford bronco i want that
thing
with a an irrational lust the moment i
saw the picture
i just i just freaking had to have this
thing
so you know i i bought a new vehicle not
that long ago so i won't
but i'm going to look at it hard for my
next vehicle for sure all right that's
my
compliment of the day to ford um
so i did a little uh unscientific
twitter poll and i said this
according to the news and social media
you consume and this is
important according to so this is not
you making up opinions out of nothing
but according to the news and social
media that you personally consume
which of these claims has more evidence
and the claims were
that there was election fraud is there
more evidence for that
or climate emergency i used emergency
just to be more clear that i'm not
talking about climate change
but rather that it's an emergency which
has more
evidence in my scientific unscientific
poll
87 of you said that election fraud has
more evidence than climate emergency
now if i if i made this same twitter
poll
and ran it on alyssa milano's
on her twitter feed
pretty sure the numbers would be either
completely reversed or
or a hundred percent would say the
opposite
so here's my point
what does it mean when people say follow
the facts
and follow the evidence and follow the
proof
and believe the experts
and listen to the science what does any
of that mean
when we can't do those things
so here's some advice for you if
this is good advice by the way and i
think you would agree this is good
advice
if you find yourself in the middle of
the road and and there's a bus coming
right at you
and you realize that you don't have
enough time to get out of the way
transport just just use your transporter
like star trek could go disappear
and then just reappear and transport to
a different place
that is my advice is there anything
wrong with my advice
do you find any flaw in my advice
that if you don't have enough time to
get away from the bus in the normal way
of like walking or jumping
you would just use your star trek
transporter
why not oh oh
i forgot transporters don't exist
is that the only reason you can't use my
advice
because it's not a thing it doesn't
exist
but it would be great advice otherwise
wouldn't it i mean if it did
if it existed pretty good advice
so here's some more advice that's
exactly like that transporter example
follow the science
[Laughter]
do we have how much proof do you need
the people can't do that you can't do
that
because you don't know which science is
real how about
follow the facts you can't do that
because you don't know what facts are
real look at the fine people hoax
the people who believe the fine people
hoax here's
here's the here's the head scratcher
and i know this might come as a shock
they're not dumber than you
they're not they're not dumber than you
they just believe something sincerely
that is not
the case so if they follow the facts
how's that going to work out because
their fact is wrong
but they're not dumb they don't have a
lower iq than you do on average
not not at all people
cannot follow the evidence they don't
have that power
it just doesn't exist right
all we have is confirmation bias and
we know what team we're on so we know
what the team argument is
we have opinions that get assigned to us
by the media
but there's nothing like people looking
at data and evidence
and applying their reason and coming to
good decisions
you don't live in that world no any more
than you live in the world where you can
use your transporter to get out of the
way of the bus
so the advice to follow the science as
joe biden condescendedly says because
he's a idiot
because it just isn't a thing it just
isn't
a thing you can't do it or not do it
it's just not a thing
[Applause]
all right um here's a concept which you
should keep in mind
we talk about the fog of war with any
big story that
just blows up and the in the initial
days
everything you know about the story ends
up being wrong right
we call that the fog of war when it's
when it's new and there's too many
things happening all the information is
wrong
you don't know anything until the few
days have gone by
i would say that the election and
allegations of election fraud
were very much that fog of war situation
very much a fog war meaning that
whatever
allegations of fraud came out of the
first
week or so after the election if you
were to look at them
on average what you should expect
is that they would be weak or false
compared to any allegations which were
developed
over more time so if you were to look at
the
bag of allegations after let's say the
fourth week of research
versus the bag of allegations on the
first week
there should be a big difference and the
democrats
have lulled themselves into a sense that
the
highly inaccurate fog of war accusations
that came out of the first week
tell you the quality to expect after the
fourth week
when we've had time to look into it and
i don't think
those are going to be even close
all right now if there's nothing there
then it will be bs in the beginning and
bs at the end
but if there is something there the
normal way you should expect
things to go is that the initial things
you heard were more bs than real
but by the end it would be more real
than bs but it will take you a while to
get there
so everybody who's looking at the court
cases that
you know got filed a few weeks ago and
it's just taking a while to work through
the system and go to the higher courts
etc they largely are meaningless
they're they're really nothing but um
stalling tactics i think i think that
was actually the legal
strategy was just to stall keep the
topic open
until they can find better evidence
i've said this before but boy do we need
a dictator retirement system
have you ever noticed that whenever you
want a dictator to
leave power what are they going to do
if you're a dictator and you give up
power
do you end up like gaddafi do you end up
like
mussolini giving up power looks like
kind of a bad deal
and if the only way you can end a bad
situation is to get a dictator out of
that job
why would they ever leave you you need
some kind of an
exit path where a dictator who's in a
pretty good situation because
dictator gets to retire
with some kind of confidence that they
won't be killed and they can still have
a you know good life and their family
won't be
rounded up etc and
although i do not consider president
trump a dictator
look at the situation that has been
created
not by him here's the situation
there's this sketchy election was that
his fault
is it president trump's fault that the
election
has low credibility not really you know
there was a pandemic
we we did the best we could but there
were too many opportunities for cheating
so we have this election that is at
least doubted by
the majority of the country at this
point so he didn't cause that
in fact he argued very strongly against
male imbalance which may have helped i
don't know maybe he'd still be
complaining
about the voting machines but
they've created a situation why where
they're saying that once he's out of
power
they're going to go after him and try to
put him in jail
and the only thing that's keeping humana
jail
say half the country is that
he's still in office and the moment he
leaves office
he's going to go to jail now
do you have to be an expert on human
motivation
to know what that will cause i can't put
myself in the president's
mind but if you put me in that situation
am i going to concede the election
would you concede an election if the
people who are asking you to concede
are saying would you please concede this
election and we can just put you in jail
why would you do that so the the
democrats have created a situation where
he
has to hold on he has to fight
and if there's a gray area he has to
push it
if there's a boundary he has to test it
if there's a door he has to see if it's
unlocked
if there's one breath left in his body
he absolutely has to pursue it
because they made that situation he
didn't create that situation
this situation was created by democrats
and no matter what he wanted about being
president or not being president
no matter how bad he felt about losing
etc if he lost
he doesn't have a choice now you kind of
you kind of
forced his hand if you want him to
concede
you're gonna have to give him an exit
ramp
he doesn't have one let me suggest one
just for fun and conversation this is
never going to happen
but it's possible it's just
deeply unlikely there are two pardons
which i think would help the country
move forward and i think
you would agree you won't like
one of these pardons and people on the
other side of the political
divide they're not going to like the
other one
so it's going to be like a hostage
exchange
you know one pardon for one pardon just
to move the country ahead
and they would go like this a blanket
pardon for hunter biden
blanket pardon meaning not specific to a
crime
and i believe richard nixon got one of
those it's just
time limited so in other words you say
we pardon everything you've done up to
today's date
likewise you do the same thing with
president trump
now you might need to put pence in
office for one day
to do the pardon to make it legal or
whatever but you could do it
and you trade you trade
a hunter biden pardon a generic one for
everything up to that date
for a president trump pardon for
everything that's happened up to the
date of his last day in office
would you object because the hunter
biden stuff i think
is real and it's also a risk to the
united states
because it puts him in a in a
compromised
blackmailable situation wouldn't you say
which
makes biden the senior in sort of a
blackmailable situation
and so i feel that you know even
republicans are way better off
if hunter biden gets a pardon like just
a generic
get in a jail-free card because i don't
want
chyna to come later and say you know we
got a little something on you
hunter biden or i don't want
i don't want joe biden to be thinking
well
china hasn't directly threatened to
blackmail me
but they do have the goods they do have
the goods or they might have the goods
so i'm just going to be sort of biased
in their favor
not because they've threatened me not
because of a specific problem
but because of hunter just the whole
situation i just don't want china
to use that in some way of course it
would affect him
fathers are affected by the
you know the needs of their children so
i would say we should get past
if if it turns out that the that biden
takes office
still uncertain but if it happened i
think we should do a trade
uh pardon for a pardon all right
um somebody pointed out on twitter and i
i hate when i do this so i i apologize
to the whole world
for doing this every now and then i'll
see a witty comment on twitter
and i'll remember it but i won't write
down who wrote who said it
so i can't give them credit but the idea
is so good or funny that i still want to
say it but so it's not mine
i'm just saying i don't know who said it
first uh somebody said it must be a
simulation we're living in
because what are the odds that
the that this election fraud thing would
come down to
republicans finding a a uh
a bald-headed genius whose last name is
brainard
now i don't know if you've seen a
picture of him but matt brainard
who apparently is uh you know some
genius data analyst
uh on the trump side of things and he's
been looking at all the fraud
allegations from the data analysis
domain and he's one of the people in
this conversation that people
actually trust because he had you know
serious
talent and experience in this domain
data analysis
so his data analysis is picking up some
interesting things
such as he said quote i can show you the
names of people who voted in multiple
states
and the raw data states make available
so in other words he's just using the
dates
he's using the state's own data he's not
making up data he's just using the
state's own data
and he said you could show that the same
people voted in multiple states
now here here's the question the first
thing you ask
is uh scott
don't you know that there are probably a
lot of people named
scott adams who voted in all 50 states
because there are people named scott
adams
who did vote probably in all 50 states
i don't know about rhode island or
alaska but probably
i'll bet there are three scott adams's
in my town so if you looked at
you know for duplicate names on voter
rolls against states
of course you're going to find a lot of
them but
i did a follow-up and i said uh if i
tweet this
i asked somebody who knew the answer to
this question if i tweet this
am i gonna be embarrassed later that
somebody's gonna just say
uh scott you know there are a lot of
people with the same name
and of course let me go back to my
initial point
did i mention that matt brainard is a
genius
and his last name is brainard if your
last name is named after a brain
you're pretty smart it has to happen
that way
because the simulation so matt brainard
does know
that people in different states could
have the same name believe it or not
geniuses geniuses know that nobody had
to tell him
so he did check for that of course so
whatever they did to double check for
that
he is smart enough to know that people
with the same name live in other states
so don't worry that that's all that's
happening there's more than that now
is that enough did he find enough of
those
votes that would change the election
well here's the really clever part
of this alleged election fraud
if the election fraud happened it
happened in multiple ways
in in the areas where it happened so in
other words there probably were
some dead people who voted there
probably were some batches of ballots
that got you know
grabbed from the people who were
supposed to get them
there probably were some people voting
in
two states there probably were some
ballot corrections there probably were
some
fake ballots fed in somewhere there
probably were some
is you know some mischief with the
software
probably and the problem here
is that if you're on the other team and
you're trying to say hey
this election is fraudulent what if you
find
three of the seven ways that the
election was stolen
or let's say you can prove three of them
you feel pretty confident the others are
real
but you can prove three of them and of
seven
what will the court say you've got seven
claims
three of them look pretty darn solid
four of them may be true but you can't
prove it
the court will say those three
if you add them together do not change
the result of the election because you
needed all seven
and the court will say it's not enough
because the whole point you're bringing
it up is to change the result
if you're bringing us something to court
that even if we ruled on it
wouldn't change the outcome of the
election we're not even going to rule on
it
we're going to say go home that's a
waste of time
so the genius of this alleged
election fraud is that it was
packetized i'll use a
an analogy from telecommunications where
your data is put in little packets
so that if something happens to one of
the packets
you haven't lost everything and you can
autocorrect you can correct and resend
it
so what they've done is they've
diversified their fraud
so that if any of the individual frauds
get found
it won't matter because they're too
small
you needed all seven or maybe you needed
five and a seven
or you needed the right ones out of the
seven you have the big ones
finding three and a seven which is i
think what we're heading toward
you know in conceptual terms not real
numbers but i think we're
heading toward finding some but not all
at least in terms of proving it of the
hoax
of the of the fraud and it won't be
enough
so it would be enough to put biden in
office
all right that is what i had to talk
about
today you know i think that there's a
good chance that pennsylvania
will go the way that the republicans
want
there is a good chance that the supreme
court because i think they've already
signaled it
that they're not going to go with this
doctrine of latches
business i feel as though
that was just too obviously political bs
that
i don't know that the supreme court is
going to buy into that
but i'm no legal scholar so i could be
surprised now
suppose help me with this right because
it gets
complicated obviously uh if
pennsylvania got reversed and either was
taken out of the mix
no let's just say it got reversed let's
say it was reversed and
i don't think this is likely but let's
say it gets reversed and trump becomes
the winner
what is the next state that he would
need to win
to flip the entire result what is the
next
state that has the best argument is it
georgia
or wisconsin i think michigan's got a
lot of issues but i don't know if that's
the most
reversible one
uh where's your head at what's your plan
post-election we'll talk about that
i'm seeing a lot of people say georgia
somebody says arizona yeah i guess i
don't know enough to dig into those too
much
california yeah i don't think it'd be
california
all right so we we have opinions all
over the place here we do not know
let's see got some new news coming in
um
all right
so let me look at some questions here
before i go
um
somebody says if he gets pennsylvania he
needs two more of the disputed states
that's what i was looking for
so that's a fact right he would need two
more not one more
so people are saying georgia and
wisconsin well maybe we'll see
somebody says it seems you're so
cleverly trying to uh
soften you up for abide in presidency
does anybody think that i'm uh catting
on the roof
at you to get you uh mentally prepare
for abide in presidency
i think that's the effect of it that is
i think that's
you know the result of what i'm doing
it's not my intention exactly
because i'm not afraid of a i'm not
afraid of republicans
staging a violent rebellion so i didn't
feel i needed to do that
i do think it would be accurate to say
that that that's what i am doing
but that's not the point of it the point
of is just to talk about it as
objectively as possible
and that's just what comes out of it
but most of you think that i'm uh
cleverly uh
cleverly persuading you to accept a
biden presidency
well let me tell you this if
there are there are two different paths
here
one of the paths is that the republicans
hold the senate they win in georgia
they'll say they win both seats they
hold the senate then you've got a
a deadlocked government i would say
wouldn't you agree that if the senate is
held
a biden presidency is not nearly as
dangerous
as if it went the other way i think you
would all agree with that
but imagine if you will that both
democrat senators win in georgia which
would give
the senate and the whole government to
the
democrats and here's the second part
republicans think that the election was
stolen again
if that happens all bets are off okay
i can't predict what would happen if
democrats
win both houses in georgia and it looks
like it was rigged
now even if it doesn't look like it was
rigged republicans are going to think it
was rigged because they expect to win
right
and since only president trump
allegedly had problems in the general
election and
and the republicans did great in the
undercard
they should expect and also because
special elections
favor republicans you should expect the
republicans to win
but what if at four in the morning both
republicans are ahead
the voting stops for two hours and when
it recommences all the votes are for the
democrats
what are the odds that what i just
described is about to happen
in a few weeks in georgia it's not
zero i mean i don't i don't don't know
what odds you could put on that being
stolen but it's definitely not
zero if i had to guess
i think there's at least a 50 percent
chance
that under the under the condition
that the presidential election was
stolen
which would which would uh prove that
the stealing is possible
right if that's true and i think it's
true
if it's true it's not proven but i think
it will be
then i think the georgia election will
be stolen
or at least they're going to think about
it or at least they're going to try
i don't know we'll see
um it would be a harris presidency
somebody says the slaughter meter is
scots frankenstein
you know the frog the slaughter meter
made an assumption that turned out
not to be the case the slaughter meter
based
its prediction on the assumption that
the
the election would be uh fair
ish or fair enough and i don't think
that happened
so i think the slaughter meter
prediction became
moot because the thing you predicted
was sort of sabotaged by something else
the the cat has many comorbidities
somebody's asking me how's the cat that
was on the roof
is the election not fair and why well
the
allegation is that the election was not
fair
we know that elections can't be fair
because the news is fake
social media is biased there's some
amount of fraud no matter what
um etc
i think the rebellion on the right is
probable nope
nope it is so unprobable
if they aren't punished for their fraud
they will do more fraud
well the other possibility is that
we will put in more controls
so you know there are two ways to reduce
the amount of fraud in the future
if you believe it happened in the past
and one way
one way is uh
i forget it i just read a comment that
just threw me off
um somebody says if
pennsylvania is ruled in the courts it's
very possible republicans get all three
is that because there's some connection
in what
pennsylvania is doing and other states i
don't feel like they're connected
somebody said is this part of your
promise to make the biden presidency
unmanageable
i never promised anything like that i
would like the biden presidency to
succeed
why why would i not want america to
succeed
what are my other requirements for unity
i think it's easier
to keep your requirements for unity
to some minimum number something that
could be done
like i don't want to have a list of
things you must do all of these things
or i can't talk to you again
but they're just a few easy ones they're
simple
simple apology
um
all right just looking at your comments
here
plus people were locked down yes that
obviously affected the
election what is my opinion on the
global reset
i don't think the global reset is a
giant
scheme in which uh the
the virus was intentional released or
anything like that
it's obvious that things will be
different
but it's because we want them to be
different so you could call that a reset
but i'm just not really dealing with
that whole reset thing
you know i'd rather call it the golden
age and say yeah things might be better
people who did the fraud won't put in
controls to prevent fraud
right so if the only people who are
working on the question
of protecting the elections are the
people who did
the fraud yeah you're not going to get
any improvements
but i would imagine that if any effort
is made to improve things
they would be bipartisan
uh did darpa win
well i think what you're asking is did
a.i win
so remember what i told you if ai is
already controlling us
then what would happen is we would get
the most controversial or provocative
outcome
that didn't actually kill us did you
notice that
ai is keeping us alive because
it could have given the election to
trump there could have been riots in the
street it could have been the end of the
republic
i didn't think it was going to happen
but it could have been if you were a.i
do you want to end the republic or even
take a chance of it
or do you just want to keep us fighting
with each other but not
so violently that the computers get
destroyed too
i don't think we have proof that ai
already runs things
but keep an eye at how many times our
our politics goes in the direction that
is perfectly
uh designed for ai but not for us
see how many times the
the actual outcomes boost
ai at the expense of humans
it's going to be a lot right
did did amazon and google
and all the companies that have
algorithms
did they grow as opposed to recent event
from recent events
or did they shrink they all grew
algorithms got more important
there are more servers more data being
analyzed
so ai grew
human beings are pretty
you know pretty challenged right now
we're suffering through this pandemic
and through the election itself so
i would look for that pattern because i
don't know we'll ever know the exact
day the ai takes over for humans
we know it has to happen there isn't
really any way it can't happen
in the long run in the short run you
could fight it off but in the long run
ai
of course has to take over for humans of
course
and they won't even have to we won't
have to fight them for it
we will surrender we will surrender to
ai
without even knowing we did let me give
you an example
i've done this one before but i like it
let's say you get an apple watch or
something
that tells you when you're dehydrated i
don't know if that's possible let's say
that's possible
probably is and it tells you when to
take
to have some beverages now you put on
your watch and it goes pee pee pee
in the middle of the day and it says
you're a little dehydrated
and you say to yourself i've got free
will
i don't have to take a drink just
because my ai
said i'm dehydrated watch me not
a little time goes by and you say you
know that's dumb
why would i resist my own technology i
bought this to help me i'll take a drink
and then it tells you again
you know tomorrow to take a drink and
you say
all right it worked last time why
wouldn't i take a drink
so you do what the ai says and you go
get a beverage
now what you think happened is you got
some information
and then you used your free will totally
you in control here
and then you did what you wanted to do
it wasn't the ai making you do it no
this was your decision
the whole way you decided to get a drink
except that you would very quickly
become addicted
to being smart because knowing when you
need to take a drink
is smarter than the way you used to be
are you going to choose being dumb
over smart when being smart works every
time
being hydrated is a really good deal
it's good for your health
it's good for everything so it's a
trivial example but my point is the ai
becomes irresistible by being
useful and that's what ai is
it's useful to the extent the ai
continues to grow in usefulness
we are helpless because we don't turn
down
usefulness we can't we're just not built
that way
we can in the short run you know well i
got my free will
i don't have to choose that door but in
the long run you're going to choose the
door that makes sense
it's the one that works that makes your
life better and it will be the one that
ai put there for you
so ai will control you completely
eventually we just don't know if it's
happened yet that's all for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope's off you youtubers
you've got another minute of
lovely entertainment here uh
somebody says this is gross well that's
a
that sums it up it's gross
scott has the good stuff you keep
talking about already come out
the good stuff is the data analysis so
look for anything that comes out of matt
brainard so the the work
that i was seeing some hints of ahead of
time was the
matt brainard stuff so that's what i
consider the good stuff
i don't have i had no personal insight
into anything about the software
although i do believe any system of that
type will be corrupted
eventually if it's not already but it's
the matte brainerd stuff
that you should pay attention to
um take us airplane shopping with you
well christina already bought her
airplane she got a
extra 3 30 i think
i think it's the 3 30.
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
later
