we got
lights but do we have
notes we
will come on in here
everybody we're almost
ready for the best thing ever
do
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization wow do I have a show for
you today it's going to be amazing
better than usual even I know hard to
believe but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that even
Starships can't travel to all you need
is a cuper m a glass a taret a tanker
chel ofin a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dope me the end of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now go
ah space s x is successful again I'm
being told in the comments another uh
perfect re-entry I hear nicely done
SpaceX well if you're uh not reading the
Dilbert comic by subscription only on
the xplatform see the subscription
button in my profile or or on locals
Scott adams. locals.com you would know
that dog bird's Clone Army is attacking
the
there will be Bloodshed that's all I can
say about it for
now all right uh today is
dday dday so we're honoring the uh
Normandy invasion vets as we
should uh there seems to be some news
from there let's see uh how could we
possibly um show our best level of
respect to the veterans and to the
people of France our allies
well it looks like uh Joe Biden is
allegedly his pants in public and
was led off by his wife during the
ceremony now the first part of that uh
is only
rumored it just sort of looked like
that's what happened because if you saw
the video Joe Biden sort of tried to sit
down but couldn't figure out if he
should or had to sit down or maybe he
was bending over to take a crap in his
pants that's what people are saying onl
line I don't think that's true
necessarily to me I thought he was
trying to sniff an invisible
child look at it again and you tell me
if he's not sniffing An Invisible
Child looks like it to me but uh one
thing we can be happy about and I think
you can join me in this this is one of
those few times when when I think we're
all on the same page I say to myself
thank God we don't have a president
Trump over in France embarrassing the
country am I
right lucky
huh yeah no we sent uh we sent our bag
of bones over there to his pants
and not make it through the entire
ceremony but uh it's a good day besides
that all right here's one of those
reasons that I think I'm living in a
simulation last night I said to myself
huh I think I want to eat a banana
before I go to bed and then I said to
myself I'd better check the science on
this cuz somewhere I read that you
shouldn't eat right before you go to bed
cuz it would mess up your sleep but I
thought I really want a banana I really
like
bananas well today I see a study eating
banana before bed for possibly the best
sleep ever CU they're packed with
nutrients improve your health and they
got pottassium and they got magnesium
and oh my God banana will put you to
sleep so
fast now what are the odds that I would
literally be staring at a banana last
night wondering about the science of
eating a banana before bed
literally and I wake up and
oh Owen sends me a mess sends me a study
about banana before bed that was so
specific I don't think you could get
more specific than
that well Disney has reached a
accomplishment and a lot of people said
no they'll never be able to do
it and when I see a company do something
that you know people like me said no
they'll never be able to pull this off
but they did so I'm going to give them a
shout out so Disney did something I
never thought was possible they're
making a Star Wars movie that I'm not
even slightly interested in fast
forwarding past the romance parts so I
can see the cool technology in the CGI
that's what I've been doing for a while
it's like G can I get past the woke
 all right lifesaber yeah there
whoa who look at that Sith go
down but now they've made it so bad that
I'm not willing to fast forward through
the stupid parts to get to the cool
space
Parts didn't think it was possible they
pulled it
off um I don't know if I've told you
this but I love believing in things
aren't true if they are entertaining to
me and and it doesn't make any
difference if it makes a difference I
don't want to believe things that are
not true but there are a lot of things
that you can believe or not believe and
it really isn't going to make any
difference at all so here's one I choose
to believe not because it seems credible
I want to be careful here I'm not saying
it sounds credible to me but I want to
believe
it I guess it was a researcher on Joe
Rogan show who said that uh somewhere in
some godforsaken part of the world in
Pakistan they found evidence of a
nuclear explosion 1700 years ago and uh
the buildings are turned to Glass and
some of the people were still sitting on
the steps of their homes and just like
turned into glass or something and there
and apparently there even scavengers
didn't eat the bodies and that they're
Radioactive
and that there was some ancient
civilization who's been coming to Earth
forever and uh it was probably some
advanced technology that they had that
did something
bad the volcano well the volcano doesn't
have you still sitting on your front
steps because remember it's not covered
in lava so even if you say well it's not
lava but it's all the ash coming down
you wouldn't be sitting
Outdoors until the ash covered you up in
the same position you were sitting so
whatever it was it did happen quickly
it's what it looks like you know people
are just Frozen in place that doesn't
say
volcano I don't know if any of that's
true I just think it's fun that is the
uh theme for today all the news is funny
all right I'm going to read you another
piece of news and watch How I don't even
have to give you the punchline and
you're just think oh that's kind of
funny right we'll test this
Senator Bob Menendez son you remember
Senator Bob Menendez he is currently
under uh invest what would you say he's
under trial uh being tried for uh
massive um corruption and taking gold
bars and sewing them into his clothes
and uh but his son Bob men's son uh just
won the New Jersey House
Primary how do you compete with reality
imagine if you're in Hollywood and
you're you're trying to make up some
good
fiction and the news is just pumping out
the the fiction like crazy or actually
in this case real but that's just
naturally funny that New Jersey you know
sort of our our fam most famous corrupt
state don't have a problem with the son
of the most corrupt person no well he'll
be fine I mean that's his father
it's not like we've ever seen any kind
of you know notable examples where the
father and the son are coordinating on
some kind of big
political oh yeah I guess we did see
that the
bidens but let's not notice that it
might be happening somewhere else let's
just pretend this is okay it's
funny well we are no longer a republic
but uh I and many other people are
struggling to figure out what the hell
we are
um and there are three competing views
one is what I'll call the Deep State
view that the Deep state is the real
government you know the people behind
the scenes the Deep State the other view
which I hear in my comments every single
day is that there's a global Jewish
conspiracy running the US government if
not the world
itself now here's the interesting part
if the Deep state is who's in charge
then Biden will
win but if the other conspiracy theory
that it's a global Jewish caball
secretly controlling the
country then Trump will win because
Trump is favored for you know handling
the Gaza
situation so we're going to find out
which one of the conspiracy theories is
real if Biden wins there is not some
kind of weird not weird but Jewish
conspiracy control in the country if he
doesn't
win maybe you go the other way but I
don't buy into either one of those
theories I have a theory of my own that
the country it's not a republic but it's
not run by the Deep State it's not run
by a Jewish
conspiracy um I believe America is run
by Alexander soros's current
lover literally
here's how that works Democrats have to
do whatever the person with the money
says they have to do and Soros is their
biggest
funer so that would put Soros in control
the younger you know Alexander because
he's taken
over but as far as we can tell Alexander
Soros seems to be a with very
little
capability and I would say he is either
under the sway of his old boyfriend or
his new alleged girlfriend ha abedine it
looks to me like the Democrats maybe the
Deep State uh had to put in somebody to
control him because he was sort of
running the country but he was running
it into the ground because every single
bad thing that's happening in the
country is funded by this one
guy am I right there's one guy
who's funding everything bad that's
happening in the country and he won't
even do an interview you know why
because he can't he's the Joe Biden of
young people
I assume he's addicted to drugs because
I just assume that about everybody Rich
at that age you know I feel like I I
feel like he's just Joe
Biden I I think Soros has a hunter Biden
problem that's my guess now I don't have
facts none of this is based on facts
it's just
observation and what else could it
be if you follow the money it all goes
to one
person and that one person is not
doesn't have any indication that he's
capable of handling that level of
responsibility but I think his boyfriend
was and I think maybe his current fake
girlfriend is so I think he's being um
manipulated from outside forces but
that's our government it's not a deep
State it's not a Jewish conspiracy it's
not a republic it's not a democracy it's
not a dictatorship it's just this one
 guy that's
it how do we just keep ignoring that
it's one
guy uh well you want some proof uh let's
see Soros back da is trying to
overturn Governor Abbott in Texas his
pardon of Sergeant Daniel Perry now
Perry was ruled to have been acting in
self-defense but of course because was a
black victim Soros backed da wants to
reverse the
pardon why why do why would he want to
do that it doesn't matter it's just more
that one guy it's just
Soros right they did it intentionally
it's right in front of you what why are
we acting like we're just ignoring that
it's that one guy and he's not
capable so we better figure out who's
controlling him because it's not him
um there's a report that a bunch of
people like uh mcabe you remember him
people in the doj the FBI folks this is
in Breitbart by the way Joel Pollock is
talking about this on X and people in
the doj and the FBI are worried about
being thrown in jail in the second Trump
term you know you're hearing a lot of
words like revenge and uh reciprocation
and getting even and all that
don't use those words
anymore uh I would like to recommend the
proper framing of this question you
ready and this is going to be so good
that I'm going to make you wait for a
little pause before I drop it on
you do not say that you're going to jail
your opponents even though they appear
to be jailable do not say you're going
to round them up in a RICO charge
because that sounds like you're
targeting people and not crimes
right you don't want to do that you
don't want to Target people you want to
Target crimes because you don't want to
be like
them so don't say Revenge don't say
reciprocity don't say you're going to
slap them all in jail here's what you
say pause for
fact you say no one is above the
law I'm pausing while you
laugh oh yeah yes ladies and gentlemen
you're going to take you are I'm telling
you what you're going to do you're going
to take the that they've been
giving us for years you're going to wrap
it up in a tight little package and
you're going to shove it so far up their
 asses that they can taste it and
you're going to do it with a
smile you're not not going to do it out
a
hate you're going to do it because it's
funny and it's going to get you to the
same place you're still going to get
your making sure the justice system
works the way it was
intended because nobody's Above the
Law treat it the way it is it's
funny you can do your business
later but for now
just enjoy the joke of it yeah you know
nobody's Above the
Law I don't see why mcabe would have to
worry unless he broke a
law do you know what uh Republicans
really really don't
like weaponizing the legal system don't
like it at all so if nobody has broken a
law I personally would never be in favor
of going after somebody without you know
actual legal
justification so I think we can say and
we can be quite honest about it and we
can enjoy the
laugh nobody's Above the
Law all right uh hotep Jesus had a funny
comment the other
day and this isn't exactly what he said
but it sort of reminded me of it so I'm
going to borrow it and this will be my
theme for the day and it goes like
this what would happen if white people
ever got
mad that's it what would happen if white
people got mad now you could argue well
you know the the white single women have
been mad for a long time yeah but you
know what they were born
mad we accept we just assume women are
mad American
women American women are just sort of
naturally mad so it doesn't it doesn't
seem like anything but the Baseline to
us but what happened if the white men
got
mad because we've never really been
close to that and what I imagine is that
people know what it looks like no you
don't you have no
idea the the the depth of what white men
would be willing to do if they had to is
pretty much
bottomless there's all almost nothing
yeah if if we really decide to do
something we you I say we there's not
much that's ever going to stop
it but it's the wanting to do it the the
being on the same
side uh that's the hard part and that
part apparently has been solved by The
Worst Behavior we've ever seen in
America by one political party yeah
we'll get to that a little
bit so here we are
if you haven't watched the the
news white men are really mad now not
alone I mean marger tailer green is you
know continuing to be awesome so you
know there're plenty of white women who
are mad and there were always you know
liberal women who were mad to begin
with but uh let's have some fun shall we
should we have some fun at their expense
I say yes and now I begin with my fun at
their
expense so uh Democrats apparently in
the hill there's an article that
Democrats feel that Biden is uh he needs
to he needs to relate more to the people
on the question of
inflation and specifically this is how
the Democrats are putting it they said
he needs to feel more pain or to to show
that he's sharing the
pain to which I
say finally some good advice from
Democrats I also would like to see Biden
in
pain yeah seriously like lots of it I
think that's their best idea yet let's
show Biden in all kinds of pain that
should get him across the Finish light
so finally we can agree that Biden
should be in more
pain um I wonder if the Biden campaign
is suffering from having a Dei uh Le
leadership does that sound like a Dei
idea you know I think he needs to be
more of a victim like us let's work on
how much we hurt and we can hurt him and
then he'll represent us by by all of his
pain so how's the victim stuff
working if if the Democrats had been
right that you can do Dei without any
cost that it doesn't actually have a
supply and uh demand in Balance you just
have to try a little harder and you get
the same quality
employees but you have to work a little
harder to you know get past all the
racism and stuff and find good
people now nobody who's lived in the
real world thinks that could work
because we all know there's a supply and
demand in balance and we all know that
people will just go deeper and deeper
into less competent people to meet their
near-term diversity goals because those
are the ones that we put forward and we
watching the most
closely so if the Democrats were right
they would be running a terrific
campaign no matter who was Staffing
it if the Republicans are right that Dei
is by its design the end of
civilization then you would see the
worst political campaign you've ever
seen and you would see them suggesting
that maybe Biden needs to look like he's
in more pain because that's the dumbest
 thing every anybody ever
thought and at the same time if you were
hoping that you could make uh Biden look
more
sympathetic maybe you shouldn't put your
opponent in jail because they just gave
all of the sympathy to their
opponent if if you're running a victim
based operating system which is what
Democrats are oh victim victim victim
don't make a victim out of your biggest
opponent you just gave him all of your
power do you remember the source of your
power Democrats it's that you can make
people think you're
victims you just gave all of your power
to your opponent why because you're a
bunch of dumb with a Dei campaign
full of incompetence not because of
anybody's genes not because of anybody's
culture it's just the system it
guarantees that you'll scoop up more
incompetent people than you wanted it
guarantees it by design and has nothing
to do with anybody's individual
capabilities so uh good instincts
Democrats yeah why why do I even need to
watch Disney movies when I can watch uh
I can watch the Democrats eat eat each
other faster faster than the cannibals
ate uh Biden's Uncle that's right I feel
like this is all just Biden's Uncle
playing that because the Democrats are
truly eating themselves
yeah that that's there there's a
interessing is that the right I've never
used that word in public I'm I have no
shame so I'm going to do it again
interessing is that even close to a real
word like sort of siblings against each
other is that what that is I don't know
sounds like that's a word but it's like
a little Civil War within the
Democrats all right um the empathizer
and
chief all right
um it's just winning it's just all kinds
of winning for the Republicans and it's
just getting funnier and funnier right
here's here's the latest funniest
winning the ex black panthers party
leader the leader not just a member ex
ex panther party leader he praised
Donald Trump yes this is really
happening
yep 50 Cent is voting for Donald Trump
and the ex Black Panther Party leader
voting for Donald Trump oh and we're not
done there's more to come and here's
what he says uh David hilard former
leader of the Black Panthers he prays
Trump in a viral
video
um and uh oh his grandson says he was
misrepresentative but here's what he did
say um he said that Trump a presumptive
republican nominee is a decent man and
quote a friend to African-Americans and
he said he knew Trump when he was a
college student in New York City he said
Trump is a person who's a decent man and
he supported the Black Panther Party he
was someone who gave us
money now who knows what's true but does
it matter that's just
funny that's just funny to to watch the
Democrats just completely the wheels
have completely come off we all see it
now right
so that's funny here's another little
factoid
Nvidia the uh company that makes the
boards and the chips for
AI their current value is over $3
trillion and they just uh ease down
apple as the second biggest company
Microsoft is still the biggest a little
bit bigger so here are the biggest uh
five
companies um you got Microsoft Nvidia
Apple Google and Amazon each of them is
over uh well over $1 trillion in value
the smallest one is 1.9 that's Amazon
now if you were to add up the value of
the five biggest companies in the world
let's see
369 11 12 13 about $13
trillion is the value of the biggest
comp the five biggest
companies if we sold them all off to pay
down the
debt uh you'd get about 1 third of it
that's onethird of the current debt if
we sold off all five of the biggest
companies in the
world just keep that in mind all
right meanwhile the xplatform and Elon
Musk has uh apparently worn down the
Australian e- safety commission and the
eare in there has abandoned her legal
fight with uh Elon Musk so X continues
to be the only place Free Speech uh
thrives the only place that anybody's
fighting for it it seems like and he's
winning and I would say that everything
positive happening in the country is
because of Elon
Musk let me say it again everything
positive in the country is because of
Elon Musk if he hadn't saved
X we wouldn't have one place where
people can figure out what's true and
boy of they figured out what's
true Wow have they figured out what's
true we're going to get to that in a
minute all right uh so report I don't
know how old this is this might have
been a while ago but uh Scott Galloway
was on Real Time with Bill M and he said
that uh um part of the reason there
protests on the campuses for the homas
stuff especially is that the students
need to have more sex and that there's a
a big sex sex drop off of young people
just not having
sex and here's my take on
that um the reason they're not having
sex is not immediately
fixable because the reason they're not
having it is that they're not attractive
to each
other do you know what men are not
attracted
to women
protesting I've never once in my life
saw a woman in a protest you know
yelling and protes it doesn't even
matter even if I agreed with it I'm
talking about even protests I agree with
and I say to myself well there's a
complainer even if the complaint is
Justified yeah I'm not even not even
commenting on the content of the protest
but if I see a protester I think that
looks like
trouble little little too active there a
little bit too active in the complaining
I think that's going to bite me in the
ass and then what about the men who were
going along with the women who are
organizing all the protests do you think
the women have a lot of respect for the
men who are followers
no no not at all and then you add the
fact that everybody's getting fat and we
all have different preferences and you'd
never sleep with a conservative if
you're liberal and and we've we've
rendered the country completely
unfuckable so you need to change that
and it probably needs to change with
women more than
men uh
well maybe not maybe it needs to change
in both sides about equally let me back
up on that and say uh that's probably a
just looking at from my perspective but
maybe we need we need to figure out how
to be more attractive to each other
maybe a little
that so why do men have a low uh sex
drive and low sperm well um I've said
this before but I'm going to say it
again 20 years ago if I went to the
shopping mall and walked down the middle
of the mall
I probably couldn't leave without an a
hardon you didn't want to hear that but
the fact is you would just walk in
public and it would be insanely
Attractive people not often you know
what one in 20 or something but you
would see beautiful people and you would
be fully erect by the time you left any
public area if you're young and
male that doesn't happen anymore you can
stand in public for hours and never see
an attractive person I don't know where
they
are I I don't know if they ate too much
or stopped taking care of themselves I
don't know maybe it has to do with I
don't know I have no idea what it is but
you don't see them I don't see them in
public don't really see them
anywhere anyway um here's the other
hilarious thing that Biden is really
brilliant behind closed doors so a lot
of Democrats are coming forward and
saying you know granted he does look
like he's completely gone in public well
they don't say that but they say but
behind closed doors I just spend some
time with him and he's sharp he's so on
the ball so believe it or not it's it's
hard to pick one of the
funniest uh top 25
hoaxes what is that it's it's funny to
pick one of the top 25 Democrat hoaxes
but I'm going to nominate this for the
funniest of the
hoaxes Biden is brilliant when we're not
watching now come
on that's
funny that is just plain
funny yeah and you know what I think we
should
do is when he's giving public speeches
because we know he's incompetent in
public they should build a little
structure around him on the
podium and the door would be open when
he
starts cuz you know just to make sure
it's really him and he'd
say folks
uh and then you see he's a real person
and then they would sort of gently put
him like back into the structure and
they you close the door and then they
keep the microphone in there Wireless of
course microphone and then Brilliance
would come out cuz we've learned that
when he's behind the closed door that's
when all the genius comes out and I
think we can work with this we just have
him meet with uh meet with the world
leaders and he'll shake
hands shed his pants whatever he does
and he'll Mumble a little bit and then
they'll bring in the portable it's like
a skiff for a president it's just like a
little room it's portable and they'll
put him in the little room and they'll
say could you say that again to uh
president
macron oh yes uh President macron we are
your best allies and we're going to
fight with you for Ukraine very good
very cogent brilliant really in
fact so yes I think we can solve this
with a little tiny
house
um MSNBC had a focus group um uh I don't
know if you call it that but they
interviewed three black
voters and I don't think they were
expecting this all three were Pro
Trump didn't this happen before MSNBC
keeps trying to find a black person who
doesn't like Trump and they failed twice
in a
row they can't even find a black person
who's who's not going to vote for
Trump it's their entire job is to insult
Trump and say that he's going to be bad
for black people they can't find
one they're stilling looking for the
black person who can't get an ID to
vote anyway so uh but one of the U one
of the people on the panel had a framing
that I liked a
lot remember how the Democrats say how
are you Republicans saying that he's
going to get the black vote because he
went to jail oh you freaking racists you
think that black people are going to
relate to him because he went to jail
CU you think black people relate to jail
and so therefore they're going to relate
to Trump what kind of flaming racist
would even have that idea you stupid
stupid
Republicans and one of the black people
said uh yeah we relate to him because uh
he was he's being persecuted by the
system of American Injustice and we
could relate to
that that's the key word persecuted
here's the wrong way to say it Trump
went to jail so he'll be popular with
black people
no no that's just walking right into
their narrative and by the way it's not
exactly what anybody's thinking here's
exactly what I'm thinking as put into
perfect words by a black woman on
msnbc's panel quote persecuted by the
system of American Justice that is
exactly what I feel I feel like he is
persecuted by the system of American
Justice what do I feel
personally do you know what I feel
personally really in danger because the
same system could go after me and it
shows signs that it will because it's
hunting Republicans like crazy at the
moment and you know you could say well
they already wounded You by canceling
you so you don't have to worry about
them coming back for a second bite to
which I say I don't think met these
people yeah they're coming back for a
second bite if they can if they could
get away with it of course they
would so yes persecuted by the system of
American
Justice um but I don't think we need
Revenge I just say nobody's Above the
Law they dragg down to Chris Matthews on
some kind of a stretcher or something I
I didn't even know he's still alive but
Chris Matthews on
MSNBC and he said
quote I'm telling you that Trump could
end up rolling the score he's going I've
got the Congress I've got the Supreme
Court I own it all I am a dictator and
then he's he finished with the punchline
are you ready for the punch line it's
very reasonable to assume that's where
he's
headed no Chris Matthews you crazy
batshit bastard that's not even a little
bit that's not even a little bit
reasonable not even
slightly it's like they've never met a
republican Republicans are real serious
about the
Constitution it's their defining
quality so you can imagine the you know
the Democrats wanting to bend the rules
and do God knows what it's because they
don't have the same feeling about the
Constitution it if your main operating
system is the Constitution is what we
need to pay attention to you don't end
up with any of this you might end up
with Republican policies which the
country is practically begging for at
this point but no how many of you would
support Trump being a dictator
zero of course it's zero and there's no
mechanism by which he could you know
form a private army or something it's
it's crazy all right here's the Bia
crazy women update I think this was in
the guardian or some British publication
uh some woman named Zoe Williams had an
opinion article says getting fit is
great but it could turn you into a
right-wing
jerk and she says the more
self-actualized you become the higher
you are on self-righteousness blaming
other people's problems on their failure
to be as healthy as you
H so let me see if I understand the
point here from Zoe who by the way is a
deeply unattractive woman if we we can
judge by her
photo um she's saying that if you learn
to control your own outcomes let's say
by going to the gym and getting fit if
you're a person who has learned that you
can control your own Fate by your
actions that might you turn you into a
person who believes that other people
can control their Fates by their actions
H that does sound dangerous doesn't
it totally
dangerous
wow um msnbc's Katie tur had some little
panel on there and she was complaining
that uh people are not believing the
corporate news anymore she didn't use
corporate news as a phrase but she was
talking to the news she said that people
are getting their information on social
media and so they're not believing the
news
anymore who whose fault is
that whose fault is that I wonder why
people wouldn't believe the news I'm
going to get to
that but it looks like Elon Musk broke
their business
model the business model of MSNBC and
CNN and most of the news and this is not
an exaggeration their business model is
telling you things that are not
true
unfortunately that is that an
exaggeration their business model
depends on telling you things that are
not true that's the design of the
system and so X gave people a place to
find out what's true stop laughing stop
laughing what I mean by X gives you a
place to know what true I do not mean
that everything on X is true I do not
mean it doesn't have massive
disinformation all over it here's what
it does have has both
sides you can actually find both sides
we can't see that on mcbc can't see that
well you can start to see it on CNN
actually they're they're definitely
pivoting toward the middle this year
but yeah as soon as you could see both
sides it didn't matter how much
there was also because you can just see
the
debunk and that should completely break
their business model because once you
realize that their business model
depends on lying because that's how you
get the clicks and that's how you get
access to the government let me explain
that more if the corporate media did not
lie they wouldn't be able to get
interviews with the current
government that's a fact everybody
understands it it's not something I just
invented today everybody knows that if
you don't carry their water at least
some of the time you don't get
access it's the reason that Fox News
doesn't have as much access to any
Democrats they won't go on the network
because they don't have to they'll just
go on the other networks yeah so the
business model is built on lying for the
in for the benefit of the people in
power so that you have access so you can
do your job also on top of that things
which are the most ridiculously untrue
get all the clicks so the only way you
can get access is by lying for the
benefit of the people you have want
access to and the only way you can get
money is by buying because that's what
gets the clicks whereas X has found a
different model which is they can make
money by traffic and they're getting
their traffic by letting everybody say
what they want to
say so in theory their business model
should continue to decline because it's
unfixable they have an unfixable model
there's no way to fix that you just
die the solution is dying not or having
bill prop you up like The Washington
Post there's some thought that Trump is
going to lose his license to carry a gun
in New
York uh there's some thought that Hunter
Biden will not lose
his I need to fact check on this if
Hunter Biden somehow doesn't get
convicted and in theory he's off drugs
now could he keep his gun or keep a gun
if he wanted a gun I don't think he has
one
is that could we actually see Trump
loses gun rights and Hunter Biden
not that's a possibility right now
that's funny too I mean because Trump
doesn't really need gun rights he he's
he's surrounded by people with guns so
the last thing you want is to Trump for
Trump to have access to a gun or anybody
else it it you know it's just there's
nothing good that could come from
it all
right so
uh so let's talk about the hunter laptop
and all the other stuff so here are all
the things that happened this week
everything is pro Republican everything
is pro Trump this week it's a crazy
crazy good week if you're interested in
seeing things work in the right
direction wow are they working in the
right direction including Trump's
conviction I mean that's very much
working in the right direction
accidentally so the FBI has said in
court that the Hunter laptop was real
after the entire media told you
endlessly that it was not so that
basically uh uncover the evil of the
entity but here's the funny part uh Bill
Amman famous uh billionaire who is far
more involved in politics this cycle
than prior Cycles so he was a Democrat
historically but he's quite pointedly
turned on them for a number of reasons
and thinking that uh Biden might or that
Trump might be a better choice
but he's not quite up to speed now I say
this with affection and with respect uh
because Bill Amman is an adult in the
room and I think he's really adding to
the you know to the
body you know politic and and to the
country but it takes a while to get the
whole picture took me a while
here's what I think he's missing he
commented on how the Press um had
ignored the hunter laptop story actually
lied about it even if they knew they
probably knew probably lied and he's
saying that uh we won't learn from our
mistakes without the people responsible
acknowledging their
culpability and that is just yet to
happen does he think that that's a
possibility that the people involved
with this will admit their culpability
because that's something I would never
say out
loud like I say almost anything in
public I would never say that and the
reason is it seems a little bit just
short of where reality is let me give
you
reality this wasn't a
mistake people apologize for
mistakes that wasn't a mistake they did
it intentionally as part of a large body
of work which they also do intentionally
and for which they don't apologize and
the reason they don't apologize is
because who would apologize for stopping
Hitler or trying to that's not an
apology situation so the thing that bill
hasn't quite wrapped his head around is
that they think they're in a different
movie in which everything's on the table
because they're trying to stop
Hiller why would you apologize for
trying to stop Hiller and it didn't work
you should have a pad in the back for
that you should get an award because you
tried that he so bill hasn't quite it
looks like you know just based on the
public statements he may have different
thoughts
internally but why would you even ask
for them to admit their
culpability unless you thought that was
a possibility that there was just a
mistake and that honest people who admit
their mistakes there there are no honest
people
the media is by Design only the
dishonest people at least the you know
so-called corporate media it's all
dishonest people and they're doing it
intentionally and universally and every
single day and they know exactly what
they're doing why would anybody
apologize for what they choose to do
every day they wake
up don't believe it allow me to give you
the score for how the Democrats are
doing lately you ready for
this this is called the
climax this week we uh learned that
fouchy lied about the lab leak he lied
about the gain of function he lied about
uh science uh he lied about the
distancing he lied about the masks he
lied about the shots he lied about the
closures everything we know about the
Ukraine war is completely made up seems
to be an energy play has nothing to do
with NATO or protecting the country or
Putin is bad we know that bid is
certainly not cogun in private
come on even the Democrats know that's a
lie why don't they apologize for saying
that Biden is perfectly fine in in
private they're not going to apologize
because it's intentional every one of
them wakes up and says it every day
intentionally because they're trying to
stop Hiller why would they ever
apologize for
that here are some things we know the
egene C Carol lawsuit against Trump only
existed because New York made up a law
that canel the uh statute of limitations
just to get Trump we know that Bragg had
to use a novel prosecution idea in other
words made up a law in order to stop
Trump and we can all see it we know the
Russia collusion hoax was the operating
system of the Biden campaign from top to
bottom we know that the laptop was hoax
as he said most of us have figured out
that the January 6 Insurrection was a
hoax because Republicans don't do
insurrections and don't take out their
guns right that was all a hoax we also
know that the entire uh committee the
January 6 committee was corrupt and that
they uh well here's one example remember
the claim about Trump choking the Secret
Service guy in the Beast the the car
that the president rides in and uh
apparently the secret service agent
wanted to testify that it didn't happen
and he wasn't allowed to testify for the
January 6 no we're not guessing whether
they're a bunch of Crooks we're
not guessing it's right there everybody
it is now public information the January
6 committee thoroughly
corrupt do I think that we should get
revenge on them no do I think we should
do reciprocity
no I just think nobody's Above the
Law so I'd take that into
account how about the George Floyd hoax
how about putting General Flynn in
 prison how about the election
security hoax where they tell us the
election is fine and then they backed
off to well okay sure they're gigantic
holes and we can't really audit any of
this thing but believe us trust
us yeah we trust you because after the
Russia collusion hoax the lapt
 hoax the pandemic the
January 6 Ox the George Floyd
 ox and putting General Flynn in
 jail
jail Peter Navaro is still in
jail and you think we're going to
believe that your election was
good
sorry now do I have any proof that the
election in 2020 was rigged nope do I
need
it no not
anymore there was a time when I said you
know you're going to have to prove that
nope no you don't have to prove it
anymore every part of the
Democrat machine is a hoax do you
believe that the election the most
important thing is the one thing they're
going to play straight there isn't a
 chance there's no chance that it
was straight none not in the real world
not in the real world in the
real world there are what 30 to
50 hoaxes that your news tried
to tell you was real and the same
 people running the election and
you think that they played that spright
no chance no
chance how about the maral Lago box gape
 how about that inflation is
under control no problem about it how
about the border is sealed no it's not
it's a big problem wait there's nothing
I can do about it because there's
nothing I can do as president oh yes
there is wait no that's a trick
too it looks like I closed it but I did
nothing
how about those climate change
models how about Tesla that just got a
low ESG score and Philip Morris got a
high
one ESG is a hoax Dei is a
 stupid idea by stupid people our
government is run by Alex soros's
boyfriend and or girlfriend this
week funny Willis Case is being delayed
Jack Smith case
delayed so you're going to have to run
for office you on your
one obvious laware case that even your
own experts say is and
that's what you get to run on so good
luck in November you brought it
on
yourself meanwhile attorney general
Garland got grilled by Matt Gates and
others and certainly if you watched that
you thought he's crooked by the time you
were done fou she got roughed up as I
mentioned but what's Trump
doing Trump doesn't interview with
Hannity says that uh Trump that fenel
and other big drug dealers kill as many
as 500 people per dealer if you're one
of the big ones he says they should be
put to
death that's actually a policy change
that would work and I find it a very
good
idea that's actually real that's like a
real thing and by the way Trump is
pretty much admitting that he failed am
I right he failed now he doesn't say
those words but he's basically saying
you know I tried didn't
work now he's got a new idea that's more
aggressive that's what you do
you try something and when it doesn't
work you say that didn't work let me try
something more
aggressive that's how you actually do
everything that
works you got to listen to a republican
if you want even figure out how to do
anything all
right
um some people say that Biden's the
biggest election risk is that uh he's
not right with the Gaza is
Israeli Palestinian situation and that
uh he's doing a terrible job on managing
U our relations with
Israel I'm waiting for somebody to tell
me that it only looks like a terrible
 job in public but really when
he's behind closed doors he's a
genius he's got it all figured out
behind the closed door
there and Biden just authorized cross
border attacks on Russia because he
hadn't yet figured out the dumbest
 thing you could ever do and he
thought oh how about
that how about
that now do you remember I told you I've
never seen white people this
angry Good
Luck Good
Luck because
you know I've heard people say you've
you've awakened the Sleeping Giant and
you know you poked the bear too
much there's a thing I've been telling
you about Republicans for a very long
time they're flexible they're
flexible Republicans are quite
flexible until they're
not and if you forget the until they're
not part you got a big surprise coming
and we have reached until you're
not what I see is a level of energy and
fight and the Republicans that I've
never seen before you know the America
First legal thing Steven Miller's
brilliant
brainchild is just rolling up these
 criminals that are that are
basically had going unchallenged forever
you know all the lawsuits against the
racists
Etc that's great Congress finally found
their balls and they're calling people
in just to scream at them in public
which I love even if it doesn't change
anything you you give me every day I
want to see marjerie Taylor green
yelling in the face of somebody who made
America
worse I'll watch that every day every
day give me more all
right
God I thought I could go one day without
a Jewish worldwide conspiracy person in
the comments but we didn't make it we
didn't make
it got
it I got
it all
right
um what else we got going on
today I think that covers the big stuff
and I'm going to go talk to the uh
locals people
privately um there may be more more
swearing I don't know sometimes I can't
hold it in and uh ah

allergies all right everybody on X and
uh and YouTube and Rumble I'll see you
tomorrow same place and I'm going to go

hear there's a little bit of a
delay we're now in the stalling just to
make sure that the rumble Studio catches
up to all of you because I don't like to
