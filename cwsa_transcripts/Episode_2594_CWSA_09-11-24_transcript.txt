could be a big audience today people
trying to find out Scott what do you
think about that
debate well you're gonna find
[Music]
out good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
I mean not counting the debate last
night if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that would
be a cuper mugg or glass a tanker chel
or Stein a Canen Jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
of the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
well there's yet another coffee study
says it's full of vitamins and
antioxidants and they studied 400,000
people and they found that uh if you
drink coffee for 13 to 14 years you have
a
substantially lower risk of
death and so ladies and gentlemen I'm
going for
immortality if a little bit of coffee
can make you live longer a lot of coffee
can make you immortal that's just common
sense so please join me in
immortality if you like
coffee well today's September 11th and
we will remember the tragedy and the
victims and the heroes
Etc um but it makes me think that uh
there there's some kind of a limit to
how many days that can be special there
there are 365 days
typically and uh now we have September
11th is special and January 6th is
special and of course December 7th is
the day of infamy and December 25th we
got your Christmas July 4th you got your
Independence Day we got the juneth and
of course June 8th my birthday so quite
a few days are already spoken
for so if you are planning to do any
kind of big thing that would be
remembered in history you want to stay
away from the reserved day
is um something
in March would be good there's nothing
in
March yeah so if you're going to do
something that's going to be world
changing and it's going to Mark a day
look for March it's sort of unspoiled
territory
there well we will talk about the debate
of course I'm just waiting for people to
Pile in here um the update on inflation
has fallen to 2.5 % which is in line
with
expectations so we got the core
inflation is unchanged but they expected
that so that's good right all the
inflation's over thank goodness here I
thought my prices were higher than they
used to be but no no now I know that
inflation is right back down to almost
where you want it to be two would be
better than two and a half but you know
pretty close let's see uh what does that
imply
well I would I would think that with
this good inflation news the FED will be
uh lowering interest rates the stock
market will be up and enthusiasm about
the economy will be rising right around
election day which should raise a little
flag in your mind that says huh huh the
administration that's in charge says the
economy is extra good right before the
election I wonder if there's any data
they left out
well according to Republican researcher
Jackie
ktz I think that's at least somewhere
close to the way she pronounces her
name um since Harris took office gas is
up 46% electricity 30% fuel oil 43%
airfare 21 hotels 49 groceries 21 baby
food 29 K2 through K through 12 food 66%
rent 22% Transportation 32% car
Insurance 55% overall inflation 20% real
average weekly earnings down
3.4% now even if you adjust for the fact
that some of these comparisons are wonky
because of the pandemic you know for
example I imagine the pandemic lowered
airfare for a while because demand was
down so I'm not sure where we're
counting from but um generally
speaking generally speaking uh
prices are way up and I think everybody
knows it well importantly after the
debate Taylor Swift endorsed Harris and
signed off on her letter saying why uh
she she called herself a single cat lady
which was kind of funny but also
suggests you know maybe that cat lady
thing hurt a little
bit maybe it hurt a little bit well as
others have pointed out and Trump
pointed this out himself it's really
expensive to be a public figure and
endorse a political
candidate what do you suppose it will
cost Taylor
Swift to support Harris well if it's
anything like we've seen before she
should probably instantly lose about 20%
of her annual pay meaning that fewer
people will support her we don't know
that but that would be a typical
response so so let's see recently she
made $92 million in a year with her tour
so let's say she takes 20% off of that
so that's that's going to hurt a little
bit um let's say that her music catalog
which is estimated to be worth 500 to
$600
million let's say that goes up in value
and she's got this uh what do you call
unrealized uh capital
gains so let's say it doubles in value
then she'd pay 25% on her extra half a
half a billion so that might cost her
125 million
or
um and of course her income taxes would
be higher because she's a high income
person under Harris so if her
endorsement makes a difference it puts
Harris over the top uh should cost
Taylor Swift for the for that several
hundred million
dollar several $100
million now you could argue that Elon
Musk cost him way more than that for
endorsing somebody you might say that me
endorsing
Trump cost me some number of millions of
dollars which it did and uh it's
expensive so I have to admit I kind of
appreciate that she's willing to to
basically lose hundreds of millions of
dollars
to use her free speech and have her free
opinion of how things should be but it's
going to be expensive
Taylor all right Elon Musk saw that and
responded humorously on X uh he said
remember she signed it off as a single
cat
lady and so Elon Musk posts this he goes
fine Taylor you win I will give you a
child and guard your cats with my life
okay that's really funny I will give you
a
child coming from Elon Musk who's got 11
11 children for various baby bamas I
will I will give you a child and guard
your cats with my
life see th this is why I doubt that
Elon Musk is on the
Spectrum now he says he is I mean he's
referred to himself as having Aspergers
but you can't write that joke if you're
on the
spectrum that that is not the kind of
joke you normally this is a
sophisticated joke I mean it's actually
really well written
so I don't know what is up with you
musk's brain but it's not operating like
your brain and my brain and that's good
for him I
guess um you know I do wonder if JD
Vance's single cat ladies you know
one-time reference he made that of
course they making a big deal about does
that feel like his deplorables
moment meaning that single cat ladies
represent a pretty large percentage of
the total
voters and people who love single cat
ladies I suppose so it kind of feels
like he you know he uh insulted a group
of Americans who are not going to forget
it very much like the deplorables
comment
um and I don't think that he meant it as
anything but a colorful way to talk but
so did
Hillary it's just that sometimes these
stains don't wash out and I think he's
got one that doesn't wash out but it
only affects that one uh that one
demographic and they were probably all
going to be for comml Harris
anyway so I saw yesterday this uh
compilation of uh yet yet again the
media that backs the Democrats using the
same language in every newscast it was
it was a after Joe Biden did the State
of the Union the most recent one and all
the newscasters were saying it was fiery
that's fiery fiery fiery and you could
look at it go oh well they obviously had
some kind of memo that they're all
they're all supposed to say fiery
because when you see them like back to
back they're just all using the same
word it's fiery he was fiery today
it's pretty obvious that you know was
sort of a talking points memo when they
all got it or that's what I used to
think and when I say used to think I
mean
yesterday I have modified my belief on
this topic because the moment or even
before the the uh debate was over I saw
the first person on the right say hey
that was really three against
one and I thought that oh yeah that's a
that's sort of a clever way to frame it
because it you know you're saying that
the moderators were for one side 3 to
one and I saw somebody else say it and
then somebody else and somebody else and
somebody else and it was exactly like
that that fiery
thing it looked like but I'm pretty sure
this is not the case it looked like
every Republican got a memo instantly
saying uh you should say it's a 3:1 just
say it's 3:1 now that didn't
happen I I feel confident that there was
no memo and nobody told anybody to say
that but everybody said it everybody
said it it'll be in the comments you
watch the comments and the PE the people
who didn't hear me say this as they're
coming in the first thing they'll say is
it was three to one so sometimes it
looks like it is a memo I'm sure that
was true with the dark thing during the
2016 thing everybody say dark his speech
was dark that was definitely a
memo but apparently this can happen
spontaneously as well and I'd love to
know who was the first one to say it did
it did it come from one of the you know
Fox News hosts who said it first because
it must have been something that a lot
of people
saw was it one of the Trump campaign
people who said it so if anybody knows
who was the first person to say that it
would be interesting because that that
just swept through everything and I'm so
bored with it I don't want to ever hear
it again because it just it already
feels like swimming is the best exercise
and it just feels like the most basic
thing you could say about the debate so
I'm like I'm so bored with that but we
will talk about
it um all right so the debate
happened um I'll be a little bit all
over the place on this because I took so
many notes but I I saw a screen that I
thought was a joke so it showed uh
Daniel Dale the fact checker for CNN and
next to them it showed a
graphic that I I knew was fake when I
saw it because it said that uh Trump had
33
lies and Harris had
one and I thought okay that's that's a
pretty good meme but I'm surprised that
they didn't go to zero why would you do
one you know if you're going to make a
meme joke and then I saw it again and I
thought oh wait a minute the second
person who's sending it
around isn't indicating it's a
joke and then I had to go look at the
source and play the video for
myself it was
real did any how many of you watched the
debate can you even believe that
somebody called the CNN
fjer scored at 33
to1 what
we're going to talk about all the uh the
lies I mean I won't have time to talk
about all of them because the thing was
it was just full of lies and hoaxes but
how in the world do they have the balls
to say it was 33 to1 I'm going to
mention all the things that were obvious
lies and that Daniel Dale didn't catch
any of them except whatever the one was
that obviously had no obviously whatever
the one was was one that doesn't matter
in other words he must have randomly
picked out of the many many lies that
Hara said he must have picked the one
that wouldn't hurt her so that he could
say he found
one I mean he needs to quit like
immediately if it was his own idea that
there was only one problem on Harris's
side just one he needs to quit or be
fired he's an embarrassment to CNN at
this point I I was kind of I've been
curious about him because I wondered if
does CNN tell him what to say or or are
these actually his
opinions yeah
so um at this point it's obvious I think
it's obvious I don't want to be a mind
reader but how many of you would agree
with the following statement Daniel Dale
knew he was lying a
lot with his analysis would you agree
with that I don't know any other way to
explain it because the lies were so
obvious and so numerous and and the
people watching it all knew and he
couldn't catch more than one that's just
there's no way that's an honest attempt
at doing your job that is completely
dishonest and I wonder was he forced to
do it at the at the risk of losing his
job was there somebody who said look
here's the deal I only want you to say
there was
one well but there were 15
yeah I know but I want you to say there
was one or we'll fire you do you think
that happened because if it didn't
happen he's a piece of I
mean that is one worthless piece
of person unless he was forced and
I'm going to give him the benefit of a
doubt that he was
coerced to be that bad CU if he did that
naturally if that was organic no it
couldn't have been because I've I've
seen him work
I mean you you can tell he's biased but
he's not a
idiot right so he was presenting himself
as really just a idiot and
there's no way that's real or organic
because he isn't he he's clearly
unethical and corrupt that seems obvious
but he's not
dumb
anyway so that wasn't a joke uh Bill
Mitchell had a list of the things Harris
said wrong I had maybe a quibble with a
few of them so so I removed them but
I'll tell you the ones that are obvious
so Harris used the fine people hoax and
was not fact checked by the
hosts keep in mind that the hosts uh
fact checked Trump in real time I saw
two different numbers one said four
times and one said seven um four for
sure but none Harris was never fact
jacked in real time and we'll talk about
what they fact checked on Trump but she
she put down the fine people hoax didn't
get caught she said project 2025 was
Trump's that's not uh she said he wanted
to be a dictator that's fake wanted to
terminate the Constitution nope nothing
like that she said that Trump told uh
Putin that he could quote do whatever
the hell he wants and go into Ukraine
nothing like that ever happened she
blamed the Afghanistan withdrawal on
Trump that's ridiculous she used the
bloodbath hoax that was Trump talking
about economics and they made it sound
like it was going to be a violent
Insurrection um they talk she said that
Trump would have an abortion monitor
that doesn't make sense and he's never
suggested anything like that um she said
that uh uh back in the 70s was it uh
that Trump refused to rent to Black
Families my understanding of that is
that the Trump um company plad guilty to
discriminating in um
renting but that that was never tied to
Trump so so there was an acknowledgement
by the staff that they did but there was
no no smoking gun that said Trump told
them to do
it use your own judgment on that one uh
Central P five she Hara said that Trump
called for executing the Central Park 5
that was not true he called for
execution in general and did not mention
the Central Park 5 and uh also
at when Trump defended himself he said
that that was when they had been found
guilty later I think that changed but oh
no the police I think it was based on
the police saying they were guilty so
that was Trump's
defense there was the suckers and losers
hoax uh Trump never called military
veteran suckers and losers there was a
then Harris had a new one she referred
to Trump's uh tariffs as a national
sales tax and never explained that what
she meant was in effect that a tariff
would look like a sales tax to
Americans so that was just a lie because
she didn't explain what the context was
um she uh distorted unemployment Fe
figures she uh she what else did she
do it's quite a long list
here um she said that there are no
troops in combat zones under the Biden
Administration she said that five police
officers died on January 6 so she
alleged the way she said it was like
they died during the event that was not
the
case um
and let's see there was another I think
there was one point where she had three
three hoaxes and one
answer one in one answer she used the
fine people hoax the stand back and
standby thing as if it was a malicious
she was talking about he was talking
about but he wasn't and then the
bloodbath
one
so here's the thing it seems clear to me
two things things number one KL Harris
knew in advance that she would not be
fact jacked don't you think that's true
do you think she would have brought out
the fine people
hoax if she thought ABC was going to
fact check her I don't think so somehow
she knew she wouldn't be fact jacked and
he
would
right now I saw uh Mike cernovich and
some other people suggest that she had
gotten the questions and
Advance because when the initial
question came out she had great answers
but when uh there was any kind of
followup she struggled a little bit now
I'm not sure you could tell from that
alone you know because confirmation bias
would slip in there a little bit and you
you'd imagine you're seeing it even if
it's not there but here's why I think
she saw the
questions um and many of you knew this
that the head of the
Network the CEO who owns Disney that
owns ABC is your best friend for 30
years do you think they're somebody's
best friend of 30 years I don't know if
they're best friends but they're good
friends for 30 years uh do you think
that her good friend of 30 years
wouldn't tell her the
questions see in the world I live in
it's just guaranteed if your best friend
has access to the questions and she
would cuz she could just say hey before
you ask the questions you need to run
them by
management and then she just sees them
and then she goes to Kell Harris and she
goes hey here's what the questions
are now if you're telling me that her
friend didn't do that for her knowing
that there was a zero chance of getting
caught because all she had to do is say
look you know I wrote this on a piece of
paper take this to kamla make sure
nobody else sees it it would be the
easiest thing in the world not to get
caught so if it has a high
benefit and you have easy access to it
you're literally the
boss H High benefit no chance of getting
caught easy
access under those conditions cheating
happens almost every
time so you don't have
to I don't think you have to dissect the
difference between the prepared answers
and the less prepared answers there's
some something to that there there was
one example I think was she somehow knew
that there were
9,000 or however many she knew she knew
the number of Polish people living in
Pennsylvania for some reason which
sounds like something you wouldn't even
know there was no reason to know it
unless you had prepared for the
question so there were some signals that
she prepared for the question but I'm
telling you that the
setup largely guarantees she saw the
questions
largely guarantees I mean in the world I
live in if your friend has a big benefit
for you easy access to it and almost no
way to get caught and even if you got
caught it would be blown off I mean
people would say ah well yeah it happens
every time in that in that
condition all right
um let's
see
so here's some of the fact checks
uh well we'll talk about that separately
let me give you the
overall um Harris won the handshake how
many of you noticed
that so Trump does this thing where he
establishes dominance with his handshake
like he'll grab your hand and pull you
in and you know like control you with
two hands and it's a strategy it it kind
of establishes your Alpha dominance
because you controlled the handshake it
wasn't an equal thing
and if you noticed when they both walked
on stage that Harris closed the distance
and shook hands with him behind his own
Podium so Trump instead of meeting her
halfway she walked to him and then she
introduced herself hi I'm KL
Harris now that was funny because I
think he probably knew who she was
without the introduction but they had
never met so if you've never met it's
sort of normal to say your name it's
kind of weird when famous people say
their name I've I've had the same
experience you know I'll be in an event
where people went there to see me
and I'll still introduce myself you know
like we came here to see you we kind of
know your name but it's just an
automatic habit anyway so I think that
she uh immediately and strategically I
don't think any of that was an accident
she took the
handshake
initiative number two I thought they
both look great did anybody have that
impression so compliments to hair and
makeup compliments to whoever dressed
them compliments to ever whoever did the
lighting but I thought both of them
looked great like as good as they've
ever looked Trump looked great I mean he
looked young and energetic his hair was
on point makeup was good uh Harris
looked better than I've ever seen her
recently um so real good job on the
support staff making both of them look
good um the the bottom line is that
Harris beat expectations because she was
well prepared probably knew the
questions and she simply did her her
standard answers
now Trump said he had his best ever
debate and he's not wrong about
that I I actually felt that if it had
been a normal debate against a normal
person you know under a fair
circumstances I could imagine that you
would rank him the winner but it wasn't
that you know the mo moderators were
clearly on one side we'll talk about
that and he missed a lot of layups
meaning that she gave him so many
openings to end the race he didn't take
any of them
why I don't know I don't know was he not
skilled enough was he not prepared I
mean when the fine people hoax came up
you know he dismissed it as a debunk
hoax do you know what else he could have
done he could have turned to the
moderators and say are we are you guys
debunking hoaxes today or you just going
to leave this one for
me just imagine that
if he just turned to the hosts and said
are are you jumping in with any uh
factchecking here or do you want me to
do this one then he should have said if
it was up to him so first of all he
should have called out the host for not
being equal fact cheing if not then then
at least when it became an obvious
pattern he should have he should have
hit it so that that was a missed
opportunity he should have said if
you're watching at home for some of you
this will be the first time you ever
heard that the fine people hoax was a
hoax you're not going to believe me when
I tell you it's a hoax but do this go to
Snopes and just look up the find people
hoax you'll find out that Biden ran his
entire campaign on something that you
could have told was fake simply by
listening to the whole video instead of
the edited one just think about who I'm
running against they ran that entire
hoax and the media and you see that your
ABC HOA are sitting here
silently they let that go it's the most
dangerous hoax in American history and
they just sat there and let and let you
say that right in front of the public
I'm going to end that tonight every one
of you you've got a computer at home go
to Snopes it's a left leaning fact
Checker so you can know that if they
fact check this one it wasn't because
you know they were being biased and he
could have ended the entire the entire
election would be over she just handed
him the kill shot and he didn't take it
and I felt like he that happened several
times he he is terrible at explaining
his way and of
hoaxes I don't know why because he's so
good at everything else it it's kind of
a mystery to
me but it's obvious now that the um
campaign knows that he's not that she's
not going to get fact jacked by the
media and they know that they can
overload him with hoaxes and it will
just make him frustrated and keep him
off point so she offloaded she just she
just went heavy with the
hoaxes and it worked it
worked so once again yet another signal
that her advisers are really really good
I hate to say it but they're really good
I keep telling you it's not an accident
that that things look different for kind
of Suddenly It's Your advisers they're
really good and if they told her look
just keep dumping those hoaxes on them
because you just bury them in hoaxes
nobody's going to fact check it anyway
that was the right
advice I mean if you're unethical in a
weasel but it's politics so it's
normal um some people said Scott you
idiot it wasn't a tie I kind of called
it a tie meaning that it didn't changed
many votes but
um people said to me but Scott she said
the thing that was wrong and then uh
Trump correctly um corrected it so he
gets the point and then there were lots
of points he made so if he add it all up
he won that's not how anything works it
wasn't a debate in in the sense that
there was any back and forth of of of
any consequence
and it doesn't matter who won on points
it matters how you felt that's it so I
didn't even score it on points it's not
like a boxing match where you could win
within a knockout no none of those
points made any difference to anybody at
all so if she avoided a question some
people said ah but the Public's going to
notice that she avoided the very first
question or people better off or worse
off she didn't even answer to which I
say nobody's going to care that she a qu
that she avoided a question it's the
most ordinary thing that politicians do
and I will go further and say that when
I first got into the public um sphere
when Dilbert took off uh my publisher
decided that I needed some media
training here's the entire media
training if you don't like the question
that they ask answer the question you
feel like answering the one that you
want to answer that's good for you
that's
and then run out the
clock because if somebody's asking you
questions it's usually on video they
usually have a time limit so if you
don't like their question just ignore it
and answer some adjacent question that's
the one you wish they had asked and she
did so if you're saying to me but Scott
she's showing her weakness by avoiding a
question nope that's not what she showed
she showed she's well
trained avoiding that first question was
exactly the way she was trained that is
Media training it's exactly what it
looks like so was she prepared yeah yeah
she was
prepared um some say her you know her
smugness will be a turnoff others say I
saw a fisher king note this on X that uh
her her facial expressions where she was
sort of sort of mocking Trump for his
various points as you know looking like
what's wrong with you oh oh are are you
being crazy
now you know so she really worked the
facial stuff and to me it was very
off-putting but was I going to vote her
no didn't matter what I thought what do
the single women and the people in her
base think about all the faces she was
making a trump probably loved it cuz
they were feeling the same feeling that
her face was exhibiting and it probably
worked so you can't judge it by what you
think of it you have to judge the debate
by what the people she's talking to
likely responded to and I think they
probably responded to her face if they
liked her uh the there were no
great memorable lines that change
anything but there were a couple of
funny ones uh when Harris interrupted
Trump he he did the uh I'm talking now
basically a call back to her doing that
in the
debate and it worked so he took away
from her the ability to do that to him
so he was prepared for that and he and
he handled it by doing it first now if
he had prepared to do it first you know
if she ever interrupted me he would do
it first you know give her that line and
then joke about it that would be good
preparing that would have been smart if
he wasn't prepar prepared for it and he
did it
spontaneously it was even
smarter so that was just a good play
whether he was uh expecting it or not
um and then she had a good line saying
that Trump was fired by 81 million
people I mean that's a good one for her
base a yeah you're the guy who fires
people well you got fired by 81 million
people it's a pretty good line
politically it kind of stick in your
mind a little bit probably will get used
again she did bait Trump and oh my god
when I saw it happening I said don't go
in the Trum when she said that Trump's
uh rally crowds were bored and would
leave early as soon as she said that I
said don't take the bait don't don't and
he took the
bait and I could feel my heart just
sink because it put her in charge she
she was
basically directing the terms of the
conversation and he was letting her
because he can't handle the apparently
he just can't handle that kind of
specific attack on his ego I guess so
that was
really the the baiting of the Lesser
important things to get him to defend
them that was just
brilliant that was brilliant and
worked um she didn't cackle very much so
her anti- cackle efforts have been
successful um I would say of trump
remember you know he said it was his
best debate ever and I'm actually
agreeing even while I'm criticizing him
because I think her
debate I hate to say it but it's one of
the best you're ever going to see
because she was so well prepared and I
think this has more to do with her
advice
than it does with her honestly I don't
think it give her all the credit you
have to say she her advisers were just
right on point I don't think on her own
she would have come up with that rally
crowd thing but somebody who really
knows the psychology of things that you
know if you stick that in there you're
going to take him right off his game she
did and it
did in my
opinion um so here's how I put it if I
put it in basketball terms I would say
that Trump uh made every two-point jump
shot so if he had an open jump shot he
made it cleanly so he did everything
that's sort of the basics you know you
want to hit hit all your points Etc he
missed all of his
layups so like you know debunking the
fine people hoax and ending the the
entire campaign that was a
layup it wasn't hard to end the entire
campaign you just had to do it he didn't
do it so he missed several layups and I
don't even think he I don't think he
even attempted a three-point shot so he
didn't get any kill shots like uh you
know only Rosie odonnell I mean the only
Rosie odonnell remark was you know for
the ages you didn't have any one of
those so nothing special but also
nothing that's a big mistake you know
falling for these little baiting
things you didn't spend a lot of time on
it so it wasn't the biggest mistake in
the world but yeah nothing
special
um let's see what else I would say that
the viewing public is not influenced by
how many lies either of them told or how
many hoaxes that's why kamla can just
throw in the hoaxes one after another I
don't think anybody cares that anybody
avoided a
question
um and uh here's a take that I thought
was kind of brilliant I saw a few people
have this opinion that it might only
matter what the pennsylvanians thought
about
it and Pennsylvania cares about
fracking so if Trump if Trump made a
dent in the Pennsylvania vote just by
the fracking conversation and nothing
else he won the
election she may have won the debate
but if he did only that one thing made
Pennsylvania little bit just a little
bit more prot
Trump that's the whole
game so we do have this weird situation
where I think she won the
debate he may have won the
election which would be
fascinating and that would be compounded
on top of her not picking Shapiro as her
vice president so you can almost see the
after Story forming if Trump
wins it's going to be the fracking and
it's going to be you know not picking
Shapiro as her
VP so we'll
see um the most annoying thing that she
did uh is possibly my
fault I have to take some responsibility
for this I I don't know for sure so I
might be aggressively connecting dots
that shouldn't be
connected have I told you the story
about helping Al Gore and Bill Clinton
during their campaign against Bob Dole
in which I did give some advice to the
campaign and my advice was that Bob Dole
kept saying he was going to take the
country back to the greatest Generation
you know better ethical moral patriotic
spiritual um ways and I said just say
he's taking you to the past and you're
taking them to the Future and that's the
end of the
race and so they did and that was the
end of the race if you remember Clinton
slogan turned into uh we're a bridge to
the Future and he's a bridge to the past
as soon as you can successfully frame
your opponent as taking you to the Past
nobody cares how good the past was
it's the past there's just nobody
interested in the past they're
interested in what are you going to do
tomorrow but if you can get away with
that framing that is really really
powerful and so it makes me wonder if
any of the people advising
Harris remember that from the Clinton
days because if they did that was my
fault so I might have had some indirect
role in that it might they wouldn't know
it by the way they wouldn't be aware
that I had any role in it they might
have just seen the VP and the President
Clinton say it and say that that sounds
good they would not necessarily know
that came from me all
right the Harris campaign very cleverly
again freaking brilliant said right
after the campaign that uh uh that they
won it and they're looking forward to
having another
debate now Trump tried to frame that as
well why would they need another debate
if they won this
one but they're framing it as we beat
you so badly we'd love to do it
again so I don't know if they'll do it
again I don't think it's a good
idea I think if Trump took a second bite
the odds of him correcting his you know
the holes that he had in the first one
were pretty high because the the his
holes are really obvious you know he
just didn't go well against the h say he
could practice that and nail it next
time I think that the Harris campaign
will just find a reason to say no so
Trump will say hey let's do it on Fox
News they'll say no we don't like Fox
News and then that'll be it but they'll
be able to say they wanted a
debate and then still not have one so
they win twice once by saying they want
it and another time but not having
it every time I see Harris's campaign
work it's always
good I hate to say it I really really
hate it but they're very smart and they
you know consistently if it were one
thing I'd be like well I got lucky you
know blind squirrel finds n but it's
kind of every day now and when you look
at the fact that they hid her from the
public for so long and then when she
finally comes out and everybody's
expecting the worst she does her best
performance that borers on genius
campaign
work maybe it's just genius it's
brilliant it's evil it's unethical it's
immoral but it's
brilliant all
right
um I think this happens every debate
every debate there's a rumor that the
Democrat was wearing an
earpiece so there's a there's some
allegations that her uh Harris's ear
earrings were a special kind of earring
that does exist apparently that doubles
as a like an earplug not earplug
a what do you call it a headphone except
is sits outside your ear but my
understanding is although it's outside
the ear like like an earring
that's got a little speaker thing that's
pointing toward your ear so only you can
hear it now there's a picture of that
device that has that quality that it's a
like a headphone thing yeah and I'm
seeing Oh here here it
goes and here's a
picture here's a picture of
it you see that so that that's a picture
that is exactly the um that earbud
headphone
thing so if this is a real picture she
was definitely wearing an
earbud is it a real picture no of course
not no that's not a real picture if you
see the real picture it's she's not
wearing those that's a photosho
picture uh very
photoshopped now I was lucky enough that
I saw the real one like half a minute
before I saw the photoshopped one so you
know you could see what happened yeah it
was a Photoshop I guarantee it it was a
Photoshop all
right uh but we're there's always that
hoax every time there's one of these
debates there's always the somebody was
giving her the answer
hoax um let's talk about the fake fact
checking by the hosts David
mure uh so he challenged uh Trump said
uh he said you said you lost by a
whisker but all the other times you said
you had been cheated so did you change
your opinion and believe that you did
really lose and Trump said that uh you
know he was being sarcastic when he said
he lost by a
whisker now that's what I
thought I I said it actually in advance
I said that when he said I lost by a
whisker that he was sort of you know
joking and the implication was that they
cheated so he said lost by a whisker
just sort of being jokingly sarcastic
about it now that's exactly how I
interpreted it but I'm also aware that
if if you if you're coming from a
different perspective you wouldn't
necessarily interpret it that way so
David mure decides to fact check him by
saying you know we checked all the video
and it it didn't sound sarcastic to
me to which I said wait a minute one
person's opinion of what somebody's
thinking is not a fact Jack
what kind of fact check is that my
opinion of what you were thinking when
the person just told you what they were
thinking now you don't fact check
somebody's internal thoughts in a debate
for
president you're going to let the fine
people hoax just go by but you're going
to fact check him on what you believe he
was secretly
thinking oh my
God that that that's just so you know on
the nose
corrupt that's it's
incredible um let me give you a little
uh I don't know why I need to tell you
this but somehow it seems relevant I
once uh spent the whole day with David
mure So a number of years ago he was
still with ABC and he came out to where
I lived and hung out with me all day to
do a story on my voice because you know
I had that voice problem for a while and
ABC did a nice special on you know this
condition and helped me helped me
promote that there's a cure for it now
so uh ABC News and David Muer
specifically did a very
useful valuable thing for a number of
people because to the to the extent that
people found out there was a cure for it
they probably went out and got it some
of them anyway so he's you know uh if I
can judge him from that one
experience very nice guy enjoy enjoyed
talking to him totally and uh and he did
a valuable thing for people and it
really mattered I mean it really really
mattered if they got fixed so there's
that now there's one other interesting
thing that happened that day so I was
married to my first wife then and uh we
went to dinner to continue the
conversation and as we're driving to
dinner my my ex-wife first ex-wife was
telling a story about somebody she knows
and it was a a longish story about
somebody he doesn't know and just
somebody that the two of us know we get
to this restaurant and we get
seated and we're sitting right next to
the guy we've been talking about in the
car for the last hour in the
restaurant and and we had go you know
David you know that guy we were just
talking about for an hour that's him
right there and he was like what yeah
you know the guy we just talked about
for an hour we just sat down next to him
he's right there we go hey how you
doing that really
happened to this day I can't it's one of
the freakiest things that's ever
happened to me so when I see David mure
I I think about that weird simulation
experience anyway that's enough about me
um let's talk about I know I'm going to
get hammered for this but I'm going to
do it anyway because I just have this
need so there's a question about uh
babies being born alive and then Trump's
claim that uh that the doctor can
basically kill them or let them die
after they're born
alive
now the
Democrats and uh also David mure I
believe fact checked that and said uh no
that doesn't happen there's there's no
example it just doesn't happen that's
just not
true
so uh I have a take on what's
true and it's real interesting because
it's almost like both sides are using
the same
language but they're somehow ignoring
part of it or something here's what I
believe to be
true that if there's an abortion and it
would normally if if the baby is old
enough to have some viability there's
probably some medical reason for the
mother not necessarily but there might
be but that when the baby is born the
examples given of where they were in
fact alive after they were aborted they
were not
viable meaning that they might only have
a few hours to have a heartbeat and they
there's nothing you could do now is that
how you understand it or do you
understand that some of those babies
could have a long healthy life if they
just put their effort into
it my understanding is that although in
the medical
community people can be wrong you know
you probably are aware that one of the
biggest causes of death are medical
mistakes you all know that did you know
that just in general forget about
abortion in general one of the biggest
ways that people die is that the
hospital the doctor made a mistake very
very common now if you assume that
medical help is still better than no
medical
help then although you can hate the fact
that medicine kills a lot of
people you can still say okay we're
still in favor of health
care if it's the same in this abortion
situation that there might actually be a
case where a baby was born alive and
they let it die that could have been
saved and could have had a you know a
full life of some kind then that might
actually be true but it wouldn't be
unusual if you look at the larger field
of medicine they make mistakes because
they're
humans
but it's hard for me to imagine a
situation and by the way if you're
thinking I'm going to be Pro or
anti-abortion I'm not I still think
women need to figure it out just tell me
what you decided I'm just describing it
so you can understand it better I
hope what I think happens is that you
probably have at least one medical
professional at least the doctor
probably nurses and some other people
involved if you know if it's a normal
procedure and you may have at least the
mother being involved in the decision
now you've got the hardest decision in
the freaking
world that you aborted but there's
something there with a heartbeat
whose job is it to figure out what to do
now it's it's yours you the mother you
the doctor and maybe a few other people
involved it's the hardest decision in
the world do
you um try your best and maybe all
you've done is taking something that
didn't need to suffer and giving it a
week more of
suffering just pure
suffering or do you say let me give it
some um whatever this is whatever you
want to call it you could call it a baby
or not but I'm going to give us some
painkillers but since I don't think it
can survive under any condition I'm
going to make sure the painkillers are
lethal nobody would check and by the way
is that unethical it's the way we handle
seniors when when a person is a 100
years old and near death and can't make
their own decisions anyway
the the doctor and the family member is
closest they decide do we give you a
basically lethal dose of painkiller and
hurry things up because there's nothing
there's nothing that can be gained
there's no upside now could they ever be
wrong yes they could be wrong and they
could end up basically killing somebody
who could have had a whole life just
like every other part of Medicine they
can be wrong but here's my
take if the if the mother and the doctor
in their best
judgment make a decision at that moment
I don't want anybody else in the world
involved because it's the hardest
decision in the world and they're the
closest to it even if they get it
wrong I still back them it's the hardest
decision in the world we should just
stay the out of that
because they're not going to be happy
about it yeah just just imagine your
mental state if you had to be in that
unusual situation where there's a
heartbeat after the
abortion if you're the
doctor how do you deal with
that I mean that that's got to be the
most disturbing thing you can even
imagine so I say under those situations
it's life and death
literally and if the if the mother and
the doctor and their best judgment have
decided that really easing the pain of
whatever this creature is is their best
play I think second guessing
them is
immoral just feels
immoral because of how difficult that
decision is and we don't I I'm going to
assume that people make mistakes it's
still immoral to second guess them I
think now this is not not an opinion on
abortion
because it's it's just such a special
case it's not really about abortion in
general so I think the truth is that U
neither side is describing it exactly
accurately and if they did they wouldn't
have a
difference if they if they explained it
accurately I think they'd be on the same
side
basically that's my take um and so
here's the easier way to understand that
I believe that when these um babies are
aborted yet they have a little bit of a
heartbeat or life left in them that the
doctor probably sees it as hospice and
the way you would treat hospice is not
the way you treat somebody
else look at the video oh somebody
saying that the photograph of her
wearing normal earrings is not equal to
the
video okay I'm not in this there's
nothing you can do to convince me she
was wearing a deer
piece there's nothing so you just give
up on that
one all
right then there was a question about uh
Trump went about the eating the animals
the Haitians or the immigrants eating
the animals and of course they got fact
checked in the way that the fake news
fact checks things how does the fake
news fact check uh something that's true
but they want to say it's not true true
they use the same technique they say we
asked somebody and they said they didn't
have any information about
it so David mure fact checks him by
saying you know we talk to the town and
the town says they don't have any
information about people eating
animals well did you talk to any of the
town's
people because apparently there are
quite a few reports doesn't mean it's
true I don't know if it's true but there
are reports
so uh and then Harris did the whole oh
oh you you think oh you're being so
ridiculous now you're saying they're
eating animals oh and she pulled it off
unfortunately she won that
round
um so
anyway I think everybody's going to
blame ABC for being bias they clearly
were um I don't think that's why Trump
did not
um did not win because I don't think he
won um I think Trump needed to do a
better job of dealing with the hoaxes
and that's the whole to me that's the
whole story he wasn't prepared for the
specific most obvious attack and if you
don't prepare for the specific most
obvious
attack what are you doing
so I hate to say it but one of them did
their homework better was prepared
better and it was
haris now it's not going to make me vote
for her because she's she's shown one
look it does however make me feel better
about one
thing then in 2018 when uh I was
predicting that Harris would be the
biggest problem for trump it was because
I'd seen her act this way you know when
she was doing some Senate hearings thing
she was like this which also suggests
perhaps yeah I'm seeing a video of her
not wearing earrings that are the that
kind
um
anyway so uh a couple of closing
things the Venezuelan gang that trenda
araga gang they took over a hotel in El
Paso turned it into a violent drug Den
according to the Gateway pundit
so took over a hotel I don't know how
many of the other stories about
Venezuelan gangs taking over buildings
are
true but it certainly has my attention
some of them might be exaggerations I
don't
know anyway if you didn't catch it on
the all-in Pod
event apparently ell Elon Musk said that
uh America would do great if they can
just get rid of all the regulations so
we can operate and he says uh quote I
think the reality is that if we get rid
of nonsense regulations and shift people
from the government to the private
sector we will have immense prosperity
and then he said I think we'll have a
golden age in this country and it'll be
fantastic so maybe the golden age is
still on but it's going to
require a trump now I saw uh the Kennedy
and shanan weighing in on the debate I
don't think either of them should be
happy about that debate because I don't
think he brought up the chronic illness
thing for
example um so I think they were a little
underserved by that
debate and uh just the news is reporting
that a bipartisan group of attorney
generals is urging that social media
have a warning label on it a health
warning label on social media now it's a
bipartisan group what do you think of
that I think it's pretty good I think
there should be warning labels on social
media but I think we should take it
further I think there should be warning
labels on the Nightly News on the
networks and it should
say this news is not intended to be
reality sometimes it's fiction if you
were to believe it as reality it could
cause mental illness such as as you
might think the world is going to burn
up from global warming so it's unhealthy
to watch these programs unless you
understand that it's
fiction now is that going too far no
it's not I mean it's not going to happen
but that would be completely honest and
appropriate to say that it's not
necessarily true what you see on the
news because if you're a kid how old
were you when you realize the news
wasn't true
probably not very young right I'll bet
in your
20s you thought the news was
real maybe for most of your
30s somewhere around the
40s you start noticing patterns and you
think wait a minute I'm not so sure this
news is even
real and then if you're me you know when
you get older you're more likely to have
been a subject of a news report if
you've ever seen yourself in a news
report or you're an expert on that
category then you know it's really fake
and that's when you're like oh what if
the rest of it is fake too and then you
find out it is at least the political
stuff pretty much all
fake so let's put those warning labels
on there people warning labels all right
that's all I've got for today um my
announcement for tomorrow is I don't
expect to have a show tomorrow I just
have some personal business to take care
of that I couldn't schedule any other
way so um you will miss me tomorrow live
anyway probably if I come on it'll be
for five minutes or something just to
say hi but uh don't worry it's nothing
important nothing nothing of consequence
I just have something scheduled tell you
about it
later um and that's all for today I'm
going to talk to the locals people
privately but thanks for joining on and
Rumble and YouTube I'll see you all
tomorrow no not tomorrow soon we'll see
you
soon bye for
now
