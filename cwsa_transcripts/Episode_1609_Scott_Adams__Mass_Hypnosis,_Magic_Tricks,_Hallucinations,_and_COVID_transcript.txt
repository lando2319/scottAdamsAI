well
this morning i'm going to print
something out while i'm showing you a
magic trick and you're going to love it
because i got to print out my notes all
right
how would you like to see a magic trick
then i'm going to
dovetail into
a fascinating discussion about hypnosis
and
all weird things you're going to be
amazed
but first let me call up all your
comments here
there we go
all right let's see if i can make a
good view of the table here
there we go
all right i'm going to show you a trick
maybe some of you have seen this before
it's a normal coin
some some country that's not america i
forget
and i'm going to make this coin
disappear
by rubbing it into my hand or my arm
all right
so i'm going to i'm going to rub it into
my arm
until it disappears inside the arm
are you ready
probably don't think i can do it all
right
watch this
first of all there's nothing in the
hands
nothing nothing else here right it's
just a coin
all right so the coin will go on my arm
and then i'm going to rub it
until it disappears
now i haven't done this trick in a while
and i'm doing it live without much
practice
so i can't guarantee it'll work on the
first try
but all right i think i got it
watch this
gone
all right well like it doesn't always
work on the first try but the second try
watch this
watch this are you watching
watch carefully
are you amazed
huh how about that
that's an example
of cognitive blindness
the reason you don't know how the trick
was done
is that i made you cognitively blind
even though i showed you exactly how i
was doing it
if i were to replay this slowly
and show you where the trick happened
you could see it right in front of your
eyes
but because i blinded you and i'll tell
you i did it in a minute but i'm going
to do another trick first do you think i
can turn a penny
into a much larger coin
you know something that
um
you know would be worth more for for
example
uh
so let's take this penny there's nothing
in this hand right
and nothing going on here
so i'll take this normal penny
and i'm going to change it into a bigger
coin all right i'm just going to rub it
rub it rub it and there's nothing in
this hand right
rub it rub it
amazing right
now
here's the uh trick there are two things
that uh
two things that i want to teach you the
second one is about
imagination the reason that the penny
trick works
is that you can't imagine
how i do it
if you can imagine that you'd see it
instantly
but it's a lack of imagination and when
you look at the news this is what's
happening to you all the time the news
will say
uh a thing is happening
and you won't really be able to imagine
the alternatives that story so you
believe it so a lack of imagination is
is also behind
behind magic here's how this trick was
done
the larger coin
just goes behind it
so when i show it to you this way
and this way and this way and this hand
it's not there and then i just go boop
like that now how's the other one work
the one where i did this
here's how the
cognitive blindness works
i told you that it doesn't work every
time
and they also made you focus here right
so there are two things i told you that
caused cognitive blindness one it
doesn't work every time so when it
doesn't work the first time you accept
that as normal you might even laugh
because my trick failed
that's a diversion
the first failure is part of the trick
that's that's what diverts your
attention
now the way the trick is done is that
when i do it the second time did you see
the trick
the trick's already done
then all of this stuff
is after it's already gone
hey look
it's gone
want to see it again
all right
oh it didn't work my trick didn't work
let's see if it works a second time oh
it worked the second time
yeah so all i did was when it dropped
instead of picking up the with the hand
i was going to use
you were no longer paying attention
because you were diverted by the fact
that my trick failed so as soon as the
trick failed your attention stopped
paying attention and you didn't notice
that i picked it up with this hand
did this
and it was already gone
now
what's that got to do with the news
well
i'm going to tell you
so one of the things i i often say
is that
if you have a
variety of talents they can work well
together in a way that
one plus one equals two
if you add two talents together
sometimes you get three
now
having um
a window into how magic tricks work
is really really compatible with
hypnosis
psychology
and politics
let me grab my notes and i'll show you
oh damn it
all right
um
first let me uh
uh we're going to get back to the magic
tricks we're going to cover some other
things so rasmussen says that uh 48
of the people they polled say 2021 was a
poor year but not as bad as 2020. does
that sound about right
that apparently 2021 and 2020 were just
the two worst years that people remember
does anybody want the simultaneous sip
are you addicted
you're going to have to do this aren't
you well if we're going to do the sip
all you need is a copper mug of glass
tank or gel stein canteen jungle vessel
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now watch your antibodies surge
ah
i don't think it's
technically scientifically correct to
call this a booster shot
but it is
but it is
that's the 25th booster i've had this
morning
feeling good
all right
um
i tweeted this today and i keep
trying to find my footing for this
persuasion
and so this is what i tweeted you've
heard this concept before but i'm i'm
trying to
a b test my way up to a better way of
saying it
so lots of times i'll say something one
way and if it gets a little bit of a
reaction
i'll think whoa i got a good reaction on
that
maybe if i can say it in even better way
i could get a bigger reaction so i've
been doing with this with the idea that
we have been blinded
just like a magic trick
by the fact that we're watching a lot of
trials
so you're watching a trial of the kyle
rittenhouse and you're thinking to
yourself
well he's innocent until proven guilty
you watch george floyd
he's innocent until proven guilty and
all these other major high-level trials
you know uh gelane maxwell
innocent until proven guilty
and then the government is accused of
something
what happens when your brain is full of
innocent mental proven guilty
and then the government does something
that looks sketchy
do you say to yourself
well innocent until proven guilty you
know i'm gonna need some evidence
there's no direct evidence so
government gets a pass
that is a magic trick my folks my uh my
audience
the magic trick
is to create a cognitive blindness in
you
that the government has the same
standard as a citizen
for innocent until proven guilty
it doesn't
only citizens have the presumption of
innocence
your government
has a presumption of guilt
meaning if they can't prove
that what they're doing is honest
by making it transparent
letting everybody see it audit it you
know know what's going on if they can't
do that
the presumption is guilt
but you have been fooled
by a magic trick
by seeing all these trials of citizens
and innocent until proven guilty is just
sort of
a recording that runs in your mind and
makes you blind to the fact that
attorney general garland
refused to answer a question from
representative massey
when he asked him how many government
employees were involved in the january
6th event
he wouldn't answer
and still hasn't
presumed guilt
presume guilt because that's fair
not only is it fair it's the only system
that can work
the the system that the only system that
can work well
for citizens is presumed innocent
but the only system that can work for
your government is presumed guilt
until they show
their records delay until they open up
the kimono and show you what's going on
in there it can't work any other way but
we have been magic tricked into being
blind to the obvious
that if you don't tell us
what we ask about your potential
criminal activity on january 6 we have
to assume you're guilty
and the republicans are completely
dropping the ball here because
apparently you can start an impeachment
uh process against an attorney general
now i don't think he should be impeached
for involvement in january 6
because we don't know of anything right
we have no evidence of that but he can
certainly be impeached for not answering
the question
am i right
he needs to answer the question at least
to congress i you know i would make an
exception if if they wanted to answer
the question only to you know some
bipartisan part of congress but i need
our elected representatives to know
what's going on
i don't 100 need me personally to know
what's going on but if a bipartisan
group
is is has access to the same information
and they're both happy
i'm probably going to be okay with it
all right so i believe that garland has
to be
at least
subject to the process of impeachment
there's there's no chance he can get
impeached because of the you know the
democrats in in charge but there's
nothing that stops you from starting the
process
because it would be
in the same way that when
trump went through his impeachment
procedures it was more about the show
it was more about the public
perception of things i mean that's why
the democrats did it the republicans
should do the same and and limit limit
the charge
to the lack of
answering the question
if he answers the question well just
drop the impeachment
likewise
our election systems
which are not transparent at least the
electronic part you can't really audit
those we have to assume that they are
corrupt
i don't know that they are but the the
starting presumption has to be
corruption
and they need to prove that it's not
and if anybody asks you to believe that
the next election is valid
well
i wouldn't trust that person again ever
because that's somebody who either
doesn't understand anything about the
world
or they're
lying to you or something
but
we are being
subject to continuous magic tricks that
make us cognitively blind and the other
the other magic trick was about lacking
imagination you just can't imagine
an alternative
here's another cognitive blindness
example so yesterday i tweeted
that i'd spent a whole bunch of time
trying to figure out how to log off of
twitter
i could not figure it out i googled it
and of course if you google how to do
anything you get all the wrong
the old the old ones for the old
software and the wrong platform if even
if you say how to log off from the
browser
it'll give you all the the app log offs
instead i mean the searching for how to
do anything is just useless
half the time um
but so i find i found it
with the help of other people
and
it was always right there right in front
of me
like it was right on the page
but here's what they did let's see if i
can
give you an example with a blank piece
of paper
um
well i'll just describe it
you're quite aware of interfaces you've
used a lot of them and you know that if
you're looking for how to log off of
something
it's almost always in the top right
or if there's any other cluster of menus
it'll be in the menus
because where else would it be all right
the the log off command should be
somewhere where there are menus
so you look where the menus are
and it's not there
you look up in the top right hand corner
it's not there
here's where they hit it
and they
use this as a page so it's supposed to
be up here
normally that's where your brain expects
it and then there's some
menus along this side
so it's not here and it's not where it
belongs they put it all the way at the
bottom of the page
all by itself
without anything that looked like a menu
it was just your icon
now if you tell me that they didn't
intentionally put it there so you can't
find it
i call you a liar
because nobody makes that big of a user
interface mistake
that's not a mistake
they they just intentionally made it
hard to log off
now they're not the only company that
does that that's pretty pretty uh
pretty common
now when people said scott
are you blind
are you blind it was right there in
front of you and the answer is yes
yes i was cognitively blind because they
put it in the wrong place
not blind blind but it's the same same
thing if i go in the refrigerator
and somebody you know put the mustard
that is always supposed to be in the
door
if somebody put it in the body of the
refrigerator
i'll never find it
because i just won't look in the body of
the refrigerator now that's a bad
example because i probably would look in
the body of the refrigerator but if you
put things where they don't belong
you can blind somebody to the obvious
they just won't even look
there
so a lot of a lot of what's happening to
us in the news is that
um
all right
i feel like trump could win reelection
by running on transparency
the transparency for the elections to
make them auditable but also
transparency for the whatever happened
on january six
and he could just run for election say
look
your government is not telling you who
won the election i mean they can't
because they can't audit it we don't
have access to it
and they won't even tell you about
january 6 the biggest
apparently shocking event in the country
and now if you go to google and try to
find the daily death rate in the united
states from covid
they even they're even hiding that now
again when i say hiding i don't mean
literally
i mean if you go look for it you end up
in a pile of you know a rat's nest of
stuff and then you get a graph
that's a little hard to interpret for a
while unless you're used to interpreting
graphs
how many people in the united states can
accurately interpret a
graph
half
something like that you know where many
of us
are the people who pay attention to
politics and stuff so if you're watching
this
you probably can read a graph
right
pretty much by the time you're absorbing
this sort of content
you can read a graph
but most of the country can't
it's like if you just put it on a graph
it's just gone forever
now compare that to what they used to do
which is the daily death count
i think was the daily might have been
weekly
was on the cnn front page and i think
you would see that single number
how many people died today
with any google search
if you just googled i think it'd be
come right up today this many deaths
but it's clear that the yeah the death
number is being um
let's say a de-emphasized so that you
become
a little bit cognitively nearsighted
for finding that it's obviously being
de-emphasized now my personal opinion is
that the government
and the citizens are largely on the same
side
about
the pandemic now
and what i mean by that is i think the
government is looking for an escape
hatch
a way to get past
all the the bad stuff that people don't
like the mandates
so i think the government wants out of
this both democrats and republicans i
think they all want to act
as do as do the public but it's a little
harder for them
because they have to do it without
looking like it killed people so they
don't really have a way out unless we
help them
um
so
i would i was saying this on locals the
other day but i'll tell the rest of you
in in public
um
i wonder to what extent
china watches the biggest
critics of china in the united states
now i think i could claim uh that i'm in
the top 25
uh of china critics do you think that's
an overclaim let me check that with you
of vocal
public critics of china would you say
i'm in the top 25
just look at your comments
yeah some are saying you know
top 10 but let's say top 25. now do you
believe
that china keeps an eye on
through
through agents or trolls or operatives
or whatever do you think that china
keeps an eye on the
top
25 china critics
probably
i mean it would be a normal
thing to do i would think because you
want to know what the public opinion is
and you want to know who's who's moving
the needle and all that
so if you assume that somebody in china
is keeping an eye on me
that also
opens up a channel
in which the things i say can get all
the way to
china's leadership
now how many would say that that's
possibly or likely true
the things i say in public about china
could get all the way to some some part
of their leadership
not necessarily to she but somebody in
their leadership
yeah mostly most of you are saying
likely and i think it just makes sense
don't know for sure but it makes sense
and so
that opens up the possibility
uh that they've given me administrative
access to their brains
which
i don't think they saw that coming
because when they follow me
they're not following just somebody
who's a critic
there's following they're following
somebody who can slip
a linguistic kill shot past their
defenses
and get it on the inside
and
change things from the inside so to
speak
and so
i asked today on twitter when did the
omicron olympics begin in china
that's right
i did i went there
hashtag omicron olympics
because
i don't want china to worry about
anything except the gigantic surge and
infections that they're about to bring
to the world
and so their olympics will become a
national shame
and will be called the omicron olympics
at least by some of us
omicron olympics
now i'd like china to really really
think about what the world is going to
think about them during the olympics
kind of bad luck that the pandemic and
china's olympic games
happens at the same time but
my guess is that this is going to be a
nightmare for china's leadership because
the reason you do the olympics is for
public opinion
am i right
that's the only reason you do it isn't
it
give me a fact check on that because
it's not really economically viable
i think the country that hosts often
loses money right
give me a fact check on that does
hosting the olympics make you money or
lose you money i thought it lost money
and i thought that you do it
yeah people are saying lose and
i think that you do it
for esteem
right
and this is going to be
a disaster
it looks like there's a disaster coming
for china in terms of public relations
i think the omicron olympics
uh the gold medal is going to go to
omicron
i think the silver metal will go to
delta
delta variant
and then the poor alpha will
will metal but you know only the copper
only a copper
so that's the first message i'm going to
slip past the censors
is that the omicron olympics are really
about uh a giant disaster and now so
much
anything to be proud of
um have you heard the news that there's
some suggestion
that getting the booster shots
uh might and i don't think this applies
to every person but cause immune system
fatigue
which would be a lay person's
explanation for well i don't want to get
all doctor and tactical with you
because i can't
so i don't know what it means to have
immune system fatigue but smart people
like ian martis
too knows what that means
and uh
apparently it's a risk it's one that
people
were worried about from the beginning
now here's my question
we know how vaccinations were tested
right
we know that uh what were they 40 000
people tested and we know about when
they were tested
and we know at least what they tell us
about the outcome now we don't know the
long-term effects of anything but we do
at least have what the pharma companies
told us
was the data for what they tested
whether you believe that's true or not
but let me ask you this
did anybody test the booster
did did i miss a whole
a whole phase where boosters got tested
now i get that the booster is one of the
things that's been tested
but nobody tested that amount
right nobody tested a
third or fourth booster shot
would we not be taking complete
well would we not be taking the drugs in
a way that is untested
it's one thing to say we tested it in
the short term
because most of your problems actually
happen in the short term doesn't
eliminate the long-term risk but
yeah it reduces it a little bit
but it seems to me that the boosters
have never been tested have they
can you fact check me on that because i
don't know that that's true
but i'm pretty sure they didn't do a 40
000 person randomized controlled trial
of boosted versus non-boosted and if
they did
oh they didn't right
so i'm not boosted at the moment
and i i can't imagine that i would get
boosted unless
i can imagine some life event where i
just had to and i was like ah
i don't like these odds but i'm going to
do it anyway because i have some trip or
something i have to do i can imagine
that pushing me over the edge but at the
moment it doesn't make sense for me to
get a booster until i see how omicron
plays out
does that sound unreasonable
that
since it's only going to be maybe i
don't know two weeks
i'm guessing two weeks we'll know
everything we need to know about if
omicron's gonna you know totally take
over for delta
and
so
i i don't think that the
risk reward favors the boosters
in the next two weeks
now two weeks from now we might learn
something else
yeah somebody said asthma is a risk for
me but
there's something weird about the asthma
risk that might actually i've seen data
that i'm not sure is reliable but the
asthma risk might actually be the
opposite way
because one of the meds that you use for
asthma this buddhesinide
has been shown to be protective against
uh
covet
so i actually take a preventative every
day but i'm doing it for asthma
and
i don't even know that the risk is
higher for asthma
you know i realize that the original
data said it was but i think updated
data
has a suggestion that that's unclear at
this point
but weight is certainly
a comorbidity
so uh so that's that's my risk reward
i'm gonna wait at least a few weeks
before i even make a decision on
boosters unless some life thing gets in
the way first i hope not
um
is the death rate in
america getting close to the point where
we uh
started opening up things last summer
so remember last
last summer when things started
loosening up it's because the death rate
had a a low enough level now we're not
quite all the way back down to there but
if you adjust for the fact that we're in
the winter
it's looking pretty good
it's looking pretty good
death rate why infections are through
the roof because of omicron
and
um do we need to grade on a curve
because it's winter
i don't know if the fact it was summer
had anything to do with loosening up
because everybody you know people around
doors and stuff
but
i wonder if we're not right getting near
the level where at least we could be as
open as we were last summer
um important thing many of the children
are hospitalized with uh omicron that
may be true but we're still at close to
zero deaths
can you fact check that for children
we're close to zero deaths for children
remember right
we don't know about long covet but
anyway
um
so there's a meme being used mostly
against mia seems
i guess other people too but i feel like
it's mostly against me
um
i don't know if i started on reddit or
wherever but the word is cope
and the idea is that a lot of people
including me
actually almost especially me
are
coping
by finding a way that they were right
after all
when in fact they were wrong all along
now in my case this is based on a mass
hallucination
and i can tell you how the mass
hallucination was formed because now now
i have a good idea for it so if you look
at you know my twitter traffic you can
see that people have all kinds of
hallucinations about my opinions
now if you've watched
most of my content the people in locals
have
if you watch most my content
you'll know that the opinions they say i
have are just not my opinions
but they're really really sure that i
held those opinions and that i was very
wrong and some of them are actually
crazy
like it's like one of the opinions i
heard today that was assigned to me
is that i trust big institutions to tell
me the truth
i'm literally the creator of the dilbert
comic strip
i might be the most famous person in the
country
for doubting big institutions
give me a second name
of anybody in the united states of 300
and i don't know 60 million people
and of 360 million people name one
person more famous for doubting
the quality of data from big
organizations or end their honesty
name one person
who is more famous for doubting data
from big organization
nobody right
out of 360 million people
i'm alex jones
okay but i i would argue i'm more famous
than alex jones alex jones is more
famous than i am within the realm of
people who watch this kind of content
but in the country
i'm way more famous
for doubting data from big organizations
am i wrong
seriously am i wrong
that i'm literally like the most famous
person who dated doubted data now if you
watched me talking about the vaccine
data
was there any time
that i suggested that you should trust
the data from the big pharma companies
did i ever say anything like that
because i'm pretty sure i said the
opposite
lots of times
right
and now
now why is it that people have this and
in fact
yesterday james lindsay was
coming after me on twitter
and he actually
dropped what he called a linguistic kill
shot laughingly
because he doesn't believe any of this
stuff it sounds like or at least he's
skeptical about the persuasion
uh predictions i've made about trump
but
um
he gave me the nickname vax adams
and then you know laughs when he said is
that a linguistic kill shot and here's
the thing
it is
it is
yeah my my reputation and career might
be ruined by that
a pretty high likelihood in fact it will
take all of my energy to prevent that
from happening
because it is such a good linguistic
kill shot
and you know it's out there in public so
i'll tell you what it is because i'm
going to spend a lot of time seeing if i
can if i can reverse it but i don't know
if i have that power
i don't know if i have that power now
the if you heard that nickname and you
heard other people talking about me as
opposed to hearing what i say you would
easily come to the opinion that i'm the
biggest vaccine promoter in the united
states
and nothing like that has ever happened
very much closer to the opposite has
happened from the beginning in fact i
think i'm the only person
that i know of who predicted
at least a non-scientist i'm the only
non-scientist i know of who predicted
that the warp speed vaccines wouldn't
work you know publicly i predicted that
then people asked me quite reasonably
they said well why did you get the
vaccination
how could you predict it won't work
and then get the vaccination
very easily
there's no conflict in that at all
now how many of you see that
that there's no conflict there
i predicted they wouldn't work
and then i got them
let me give you another example
i've also predicted
that it's unlikely that ivermectin makes
a difference
and i would take it if i got
if i got coveted
is that inc is that incompatible
unlikely
i predict that ivermectin will be shown
not to be a big deal
at the same time
if i get covered i'll take it right away
assuming my doctor agrees you know i'm
not doing the the horse-paced version
now why is that
because a risk management decision is
not like a prediction they're just two
different things
and if i can predict that the vaccine
won't work
let's say i'm predicting 75 chance it
won't work
but if there's a 25 chance it does work
there may be a situation if you're a
certain age or comorbidity or whatever
that is worth a shot
it still makes sense
so there's no there's no conflict there
at all and also we had lots more
information by the time i got the shot
so i also waited
i think six months
from the first availability of the shot
to get as much data as i could
why did i wait
because i didn't trust the data
somebody says you were paid uh
i wish how much would they have to pay
me
to get vaccinated
if i didn't want to get a vaccination
but what would be my
price tag for that
do you have any idea how much that would
cost
that would cost a lot like i don't know
if anybody would pay that
um
so uh
so
wildly through the internet and i think
part of it is that whenever you want to
win an argument you want to win it as
somebody's expense
so we like to put
we like to put names and faces on our
uh our arguments
so somehow my name and face are being
tacked onto the provax
side
when that's
highly misleading
highly misleading
but
yes in fact the vax adams linguistic
kill shot if that if that became like a
growing trend would actually take me out
of the game because every time i said
anything about anything
somebody would say well there's max
adams
you know he was wrong about all the
vaccinations in fact i have the best
prediction record of the pandemic by far
now i make that claim because i hope
somebody will challenge it someday
but my public claim is that nobody made
better predictions than i did
in the pandemic not even close
now did i guess i'm wrong
yes of course
yeah
everybody who predicts lots of stuff
gets things wrong because you can't
really predict the future
that's not a thing
i mean you could try but we don't nobody
has access to it it's not like you get
it right every time
so let's see what happens
anyway it looks like i will be the
sacrificial
attack dog
for all the people who were sure the
government was lying
now i also asked the question and i got
so far zero answers
i asked on twitter name name one thing
that you're sure the government or big
pharma
lied about
relative to covet in the pandemic
besides masks because they've already
admitted that but besides masks
what has the government or big pharma
lied about
not being wrong
but lied about
no vaccines there's no evidence they
lied
now i'm not saying they didn't lie
right so let's be careful i'm not saying
the government didn't lie and i'm not
saying that pharma didn't lie because
they're both entities that lie a lot
they're very lying entities but do you
have an example
of something that isn't clearly
something that isn't clearly a mistake
the lethality of ivermectin you don't
think that the ivormectin is just a
different opinion
because that's all i think it is i think
it's just a different opinion
for most people
now it could be that big pharma is
funding studies that make ivermectin
look bad or something
but in terms of a lie
what would be a direct lie now don't go
back to tuskegee we're talking about the
co just covet
uh asymptote now
so you're you're all of the examples are
things that they thought were true and
they were just wrong
do you actually believe that the
government didn't know
or let's say do you believe the
government knew
from day one
that they would do boosters
do you think they knew that
but there's no evidence of that right
so
so here's the
getting back to my original standard
if the government is suspected of
something
do you presume innocence or presume
guilt
you can presume guilt
so those of you who are saying
the government told us one thing but
then we found out a second thing was
true
it's fair to presume guilt but there's
no evidence of it
would you would you give me that
it's fair to presume guilt
because it's uh the burden is on them to
prove it
but there's no evidence of it
that i'm aware of
now if
there is evidence
that somebody in the government or
pharma lied about the knowledge that
boosters would be even likely
um
tweet that at me because i've not seen
anything like that
um when they said that
hydroxychloroquine was not safe for
children they lied
or was that a different opinion
because you could imagine
that if somebody said i believe
right or wrong but let's say a doctor
believed the hydroxychloroquine had zero
use for covid
but every drug has at least some risk
for somebody
then you would say it's too risky for
children
that sounds like an opinion it doesn't
sound like a lie
because i don't know who would have the
the reason to lie about that
no vax passports see everything here is
about bad predictions
i do believe that the government
wouldn't want to do vaccine passports
but may have you know evolved into that
position so i don't think you can say
they're lying if they have one position
in one situation
you get more data and they change their
position
that could be incompetence it could be
lying it could be just being wrong it
could be predicting badly
how do you sort that out
i'm with you on the presumption of lying
can we meet in the middle
can we meet in the middle and say that
i 100 agree with you
that if you start with the presumption
of guilt
that's a better system than a
presumption of innocence until proven
guilty
does everybody agree with that
it's just a better system presume the
government lied to you until they prove
they haven't
yeah could they i don't know if you
could prove that it'd be tough to prove
but you should still have the
transparency so maybe maybe this is
where
many of you who have been quite
uncomfortable with my position maybe
this is where we can come together
i'm kind of adamant about not drawing
judgments without evidence
and a lot of the claims against the
government are evidence-free claims
based on history based on not trusting
them but i'm completely with you
on the history and not trusting them
and where i think where we can meet in
the middle is we just agree that the
burden is on them
and you have to start with the
assumption of bad intention
that's fair
there's no presumption of innocence for
the government
there's also in my my opinion
no direct evidence that somebody lied
about some of these big things there is
directed evidence they lied about the
masks
all right let me let me list some of my
predictions that i think i got right
about govet
and then you can tell me something i got
wrong
on the list of things i got wrong there
were at different times i had different
estimates of death
ultimate death rates
so as
their the data changed or what we knew
changed i changed my opinion about the
death rates so if you wanted to
mark me as wrong in my initial ones
because when we did the the two-week
lockdown
i thought wow
if the experts think we can get through
this with a two-week lockdown
the death rate's going to be
less than the regular flu
should be should be maybe we even save
lives
but that was based on the assumption
that that the two week
flattened the curve had a chance
right so that failed completely
and uh not long after that my estimate
of death
was over a million
i think you can check this in my record
now we it looks like we'll cross a
million pretty easily and my biggest
disagreement with was with people who
said it would be under a hundred
thousand
which would put it in regular flu range
say some not me but say some
um
and i always said that the death rate
would be way more than one once we got
going after we got past that two-week
period and it looked more serious
to me it looked like
uh scott you said real death count is
closer to 225.
find me the the source of that because i
know that during the course of the
pandemic i've revised my death counts a
number of times so here's here's what
i'll say
the
the the correct predictions that i'll
claim are that it was not a regular flu
some of you are still back in regular
flu territory but um
from the start
i said this is not like the regular flu
and and the risk of it is much higher
you will remember that i was i think one
of the first one or two
public figures jack bosovic was there
early to
uh to call for china
to close travel or for us to close
travel with china
at least a week before the president
closed it
so if you go back to my original close
the border you could see that i was
concerned that this was not the regular
flu
until we do right it was a fog of death
there's the fog of war
so it just seemed you know closing the
border until we knew what was what just
made sense
um there was a time
and i i have to give you a confession
um
i did lie to you
i did lie to you
it's kind of hard for me to say
uh during the pandemic
i told you a lie
that was a whopper
like a really big one
and i told it a lot of times
a lot of times do you know what it was
does anybody know
now i'm not about masks i was right
about masks from the start
or it seems i mean maybe we could
uh not about the vaccine
nope
not about the vaccinations at least for
them not about the origin not about the
golden age i think i think we are in the
golden age we're looking good for
that you got the virus now
it's way worse than that
all right let me let me use some
background i'll i'm gonna i'm gonna open
the kimono a little bit here
when
when the original uh and you've heard
parts of this maybe but
um this was pure dishonesty
this was pure dishonesty
in the beginning of the pandemic i heard
from some of the smartest people
in the country
that we were totally
and the civilization
had a few weeks left in it
and that it wasn't so much that the
virus would kill us but the disruption
in all of our systems
would crash the entire system
in other words the psychology of the
pandemic
would destroy civilization
and i believed
there was a really good chance that that
would happen
because the argument for it was
pretty damn good
that the virus would be bad but the
reaction to it would be far worse
and that as soon as you introduce
friction into all these systems that are
in interconnected
the interconnectivity of it would just
crash the whole system
and that's what i believed
was very likely
for the first few months of the pandemic
and i lied to you
i lied to you
i told you everything would be fine
i told you that we would work it out
and that the
the human ability would overcome
all of these problems
and every day i came on live stream and
told you you know you're going to be
fine
we're going to work this out
and i lied to you
now
i lied to you for a purpose
and the purpose was
that if mass psychology was the big risk
that somebody needed to turn that ship
you will recall that a great many people
in the media well actually you don't
know this but a lot of people in the
media
have said to me privately
that i kept them sane
during that period because i think i was
the most uh
let's say calming voice
that we could get through this that i
heard i mean i don't i didn't hear
anybody else
uh telling you every day that we know
how to fix this like we'll figure it out
we'll get through this
and
i did that because that's how you get
through it
that's how you get through it
and by persuading people that they would
be fine
you could reduce maybe the hoarding
because the hoarding could have taken us
down right the hoarding of of goods
alone
could have crashed civilization
it could have
and
i needed to help at least take the edge
off
just take the edge off
and so
while i was more afraid than anything
i've ever feared in my life
in the in the early parts of the
pandemic
uh i lied to you and said that looks
fine we're to be good we'll work through
this
now
that's my confession
now i i like to think that i lied to you
for a good purpose
and that it had a utility
and that that utility was good for me
right everybody has a personal interest
in everything
but
primarily to keep the world running
right
it was mostly about keeping the damn
world running
i think i even told you you wouldn't run
out of toilet paper
i think i told you that we came close to
running out but we didn't
now
let me let me promise you this
i'll make you a promise if there's ever
another situation
in which i have this choice again
where i can either be honest
or i can try to save your life
i'm gonna lie to you again
because i'm still gonna try to save your
life
i'm not i'm not gonna
like put honesty over your damn life
so
uh
so i apologize
this is this is my formal uh admission
of lying to you all big lie
i mean that's a big lie
there's no way to there's no way to
sugarcoat that
but
um i did it for that that purpose and
that intention
and
i think it worked
i think it worked
so if it worked for you
thank you apology accepted
um
he had the big lie
and you know i did have two competing
thoughts you know to be honest my
competing thought was that we would get
through it
but you know it was
it was really competitive with my
thought that we're really really close
really really close to something bad
now having had a test run with a
pandemic
what's going to happen if another
pandemic hits
well it won't be as bad
i mean you can imagine the virus itself
might be worse but let's say it's
another pandemic of this scale i feel
like we could just
we could just paddle right through it
like just like a
hot knife through butter
so we're definitely in better shape than
we're bound let me make my argument for
the golden age you've heard it before
nuclear power is back
climate change in my opinion is largely
solved in the sense that we know how to
build enough solar panels and batteries
and nuclear power plants to have all the
energy we need
um so we do know how to do it and we do
know how to mitigate against the warming
that there will be we do know how to
reforest
the deserts
we can reforest deserts that's like real
we can do that now
and
and so
uh you're lying again
somebody says no actually this i believe
so this this stuff uh i believe
uh i believe that the mrna platforms
will end up um
being used for curing cancer and a
variety of other things i think that uh
one of the the weird side effects of the
pandemic
i don't know if i've mentioned this
before but what happens when you take
all the medical experts in the world and
you give them a reason to communicate
with each other
and the medical scientists
i feel as though the connections that
were made in the at the top level
of the medical community
are
oh my god valuable
like maybe nothing more valuable has
ever happened
you know in recent civilization
but it's sort of invisible because it's
just a bunch of people who have met each
other
like that's all you know it's like oh
all the experts
know how to contact each other and share
information now in a way they never
could before
that's sort of like silicon valley is
formed
well they haven't done much yet but all
the really smart technical people seem
to be moving into the same area of the
country
let's watch and see what happens right
now that they all know each other and
they're in the same place
so and that's a big deal
um
my biggest problem is inflation but that
ends up just being a stealth tax
and we i think we can survive taxes
is this my way of doing year in review
yeah i'm trying to give you the
optimistic view
that
the
the
i guess the weight of the pandemic
makes us blind to other things this is
another example of cognitive blindness
because our attention is being put on
the you know kovitkov itself and you can
you can just miss the fact
that well here here's one
manufacturing
will probably be migrating back from
china and that's something that happened
this year
that's gigantic
that is so big
um
elon musk put a rocket into space
uh
and
you know now he can retrieve his rockets
and reuse them so space travel just made
a gigantic move forward
on economics alone
not just feasibility
and
so we're you know we've we've entered
space like we've never done we've got
nuclear like we've never done
we're this close to curing cancer and
the common cold
you know we are so
swimming in good news
but it's invisible
it's uh it's invisible because we're
focusing in the wrong place
um
you know we have massive
crime waves and stuff like that and
which is even affecting my neighborhood
by the way i i live in about
the safest place you could live in the
united states
you know short of
you know some really rural place
but my neighborhood is like full of
crime now like we're
we're organizing
as
as well-off neighborhoods do we're
organizing you know the commun the
neighborhood watch and you know we're
putting up
video everywhere i mean we'll have video
of every inch in the neighborhood pretty
soon
and
uh we're talking about hiring our own
security
right as probably a lot of neighborhoods
are
so
uh you know
that's how bad the crime is has come
that it reached my neighborhood and i i
moved to a place where there would be no
crime
right i mean i i picked this town
in large part because well there'll
never be a crime wave
but there is
so
um
anyway
i think that psychedelics will be
approved
more so than
the beginning
i think that
the mental health crisis in this country
is about this close to being solved
do you believe that
massive mental health problem in the
country
about that close to being sold
with hallucinogens
see if you're not up on this topic you
don't know how powerful this is
there are people who have you know quit
addictions
and lost lifetime of depression on one
psychedelic experience
and it's fairly common
and apparently it's reproducible
so
uh big pharma won't allow it yeah they
will they'll just get in on it
big pharma will find a way to make some
money on it
so you can doubt it but the
there's certainly strong indications
that that's going to happen
how to make things worse no i think the
uh
the psychedelics will be used within the
medical context
we just need to get that approved
pushing more drugs well
we are we are a drug-addled world the i
think the biggest problem with modern
society is social media i think that
broke us all
you all show your true colors in the
comments jake says yeah the the people
who are um having a bad reaction to the
idea of psychedelics
do some research
do some research if you look at what
we've learned in the last just few years
uh you'll be amazed
you'll be amazed that a lot of that
stuff was demonized and you know maybe
you should demonize it for purely
recreational uses but within the medical
context
it is
it's going to be a miracle drug it's
going to be a big big deal
all right yes government and feared
stopping child trafficking well that's a
tough one i don't know that that's going
to happen
right away
what do you say about research
what about it
be more specific
oh when somebody says i became vax adams
when i said when i got faxed and i don't
care if you die
i think that's uh
okay
but that was agreeing with him so
they're mad at me for agreeing with them
that i'm 100 in favor of their freedom
to do whatever they want
so they're mad at me for agreeing with
them really hard
i think that's what's what's happening
you you should see the number of people
who are agreeing with me angrily
do you get that
i i don't know if this is just a
something that happens because of the
way i argue with people but people will
get real mad at me while agreeing with
me
that's a weird thing
yeah
yeah are you following the story of mike
cernovich was stalked by a guy
at one point he was being stalked by
some guy and that guy just became a mass
shooter
that
that's some scary stuff
you know i immediately looked at the
name to see if i'd had any interaction
with him but i don't think i have
um
oh yeah somebody says vax adams won't
stick because i'm the dilbert guy
already well you know
i think you could have more than one
nickname unfortunately
um
it's cute
all right that's all i got now
and uh is everybody ready for is is this
new year's
it is right
is anybody doing anything tonight
is this new year's eve
like new year's eve is usually the one i
ignore
i i i can't really get excited over a
random date on a calendar
random date yay random date
yeah i don't drink
so new year's eve without alcohol is
just a way to be tired in the morning
all right well that's all i got for now
not much news happening i'm sure we'll
have a big year coming i can't wait for
the 2022 election cycle which starts
tomorrow
and
i hope you got something out of this
today
and i will talk to you
in the morning
maybe i'll do a live stream at night
maybe but i don't know we'll see
