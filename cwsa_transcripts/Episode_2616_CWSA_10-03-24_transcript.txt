the stock market what would you be doing
today it's not looking that
good well I'm sure it'll pick up it'll
pick
up we're going to do a show that will
Delight you in ways that you didn't even
know you could be
delighted yeah wait for
that let's get our comments up from the
locals people who are special in every
way
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams for lots
of good reasons and if you'd like to
take your experience up to levels that
nobody can understand with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need for that
is a cuper Mugger glass Tacker cheler
Stein a canteen Jugger flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine h
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sipping happens now
go oh my goodness I'm
quivering quivering with excitement
did you know that you could buy only the
hard copy version of wind bigley because
Amazon is in charge of the Kindle and
the soft cover this one comes from a
third party but uh you can only buy the
hard cover of the new second edition
it's the second edition of wh bigley
it's uh got some minor updates similar
to the first version with a few updates
that you might like but
do you know what you do when Amazon says
we're not going to publish your book and
we're not going to give you a
reason
nothing so apparently Amazon can just
decide that this book won't be published
in in two of its forms even though one
of them they're
publishing now see if you can understand
this they've AC they've accepted the
hard cover and you can buy it right
now the soft cover and the Kindle are
rejected although they're identical to
this same title same
content everything but one of them is
accepted and the others are rejected and
there is no way to find out why or to
fix it there's no mechanism there's no
way to reach anybody and you just get
automated responses and say we rejected
it if you try to follow up
digitally now here's the question is
that political do you think it's a
coincidence that one of the books that
would give you the best impression of
trump uh even though the book is about
persuasion it's not about politics per
se do you think it's a coincidence that
that's not allowed to be published and
that there's no explanation remember the
hard cover is published on the same
platform so it's not the
content and if it were something
technical it would be great if they told
us but I don't know what it would
be so we have big question marks on that
all right um I was going to have a guest
this morning but uh there's a technical
level of complexity involved that I
couldn't solve in time for the show so I
think I'll do that separately we'll do a
separate feed at some point real soon
anyway uh flood
update some people are saying that FEMA
is failing you know I don't think you
can ever tell if FEMA is doing a good
job or a bad job during the
event because it would be quite normal
that if you were one of the people in
you know the actual flood disaster
Zone whatever FEMA did wouldn't feel
like
enough so I'm not going to defend FEMA
that's not my job but I would say that
we're not going to really know if they
performed until the end
um we do know there's a bunch of stuff
that's not getting done we know that
there's lots of services that are not
completed and people are stranded and
there's all kinds of problems but that
doesn't mean the FEMA is failing
necessarily or in some comprehensive way
the the things we worry about are
allegedly some of the equipment that we
could have use to get the electricity
working in those places has already been
donated to Ukraine to get their
electrical grid working so if that's
true and I can't confirm that's true
that would be a big deal uh we also hear
that maybe females had of money because
they gave a lot of money to the migrant
um processes which are not really
supposed to be their primary duty if
that's true and I can't confirm it's
true that would be a big deal but I
can't really see the US government
running out of money just for one thing
when in fact we have no money for
anything how do you run out of money
when there's no money in existence in
the first place you can't run out of
something you don't have so what we have
is credit I don't know why we have it I
mean we shouldn't but we
do
so um Brian Kemp said he was
outraged so governor of Georgia he he
had to call the white house uh after
only 11 of the 90 counties hit were
included in the the FEMA disaster
declaration now if that's
true and and of course all these stories
you haven't heard the other side you
know maybe FEMA says something like well
we didn't declare them but we still do
all the work so nothing really is
different so if if you haven't heard the
other side you just don't
know yeah so it seems unlikely that they
just gave their money all to you know
illegal immigrants or legal
immigrants so keep an open mind about
that uh but it doesn't look good if if
you're asking me does it look good I'd
say no it it looks like there's some
female problems but I would give them a
little bit of little bit of a slack
until we know what's what it's still the
fog of war in that situation but it does
seem pretty pretty
bad um us job claims have risen a little
bit more than estimated and hiring fell
to 3.3% in August matching the lowest
level since uh 2013 unless you include
Co so employment
looks sort of just tepid not great not
terrible uh no no real story there it's
just not
good but I wonder if we're already
seeing the effects of people assuming
that robots are going to be doing more
than more than the employees do you
think anybody is saying I better stop
hiring because I know I'm going to have
to do a lot of firing because I'm going
to replace people with AI and
robots there I just saw an estimate
there's somebody who knows a lot about
AI who thinks that only 5% of jobs could
ever be replaced by
AI paperback and Kindle are
there oh so somebody saying that maybe
Amazon has approved it since this
morning well that would be explained by
me going public and torching them on
a I was just beginning to torch
them so I'll check on that and we'll
we'll see but I'm getting a report in
the comments that the uh the Kindle
version and the soft govern might be
approved I just don't know
why all
right so we'll keep an eye on that um so
anyway the expert thinks that only 5% of
jobs might be ever replaced with AI
based on the current kinds of AI if we
get some better kind of AI in the future
then more jobs can be replaced but I've
got a real
question I'm not so sure robots are
going to
work are
you you know if if only 5% of jobs can
be re replaced by
AI does it become more jobs as soon as
you add the robot body to it because
then the body can lift things and move
things in the real world or does it stay
5% because here's my thing I I spend a
lot of time with h chat GPT Ai and it's
improving you know it's improving at you
an impressive rate but it's nowhere near
something I would trust in a robot
body and is there something I don't know
about what's going on is there a whole
different AI That's for
robots because if I had to depend on the
reliability of chat GPT to put in a
robot that could lift me up and throw me
across the room I don't know if I'd want
my robot to have that brain in there you
if if it's bigger than me I think the
biggest robot I would allow in my home
would be maybe 5et
tall I don't want any robot that could
beat me in a fair fight like I I want to
think oh it's only 5 feet tall I can
like push it over and then outrun it
because they still they still walk like
Joe
Biden for some reason nobody can fix
that 30 years of freaking robots in
movies and they still can't walk fast
nobody can make a robot that can walk
fast I don't get that seems like that
would be the easiest thing to
fix well here's my take on
politics in case you're wondering would
you like to hear my take on politics
have you noticed that the things that
Democrats are afraid of and the things
that Republicans are afraid of are very
different now you're going to say to
yourself du yes that's the whole point
of politics one group is afraid of
certain issues the others afraid of the
other issues and you you tend to work on
things you're most afraid
of sometimes we work on things that are
like investments in the future but
mostly politics is about what's
bothering you the most what scares you
the most then you put all your resources
in that direction so you won't be scared
so you build up militaries and stuff
like that but have you noticed there's a
qualitative difference between what uh
Democrats and Republicans are afraid of
that goes beyond
policy you would expect them to be
afraid of different things just because
they have different political
views but here are some things that
Democrats are afraid of they're afraid
of
trump they're afraid of Trump's chaos
and his personality and all the things
you'll do and you'll you'll be stealing
your democ you'll be stealing your
democracy they say it could be the end
of democracy so the number one thing the
Democrats are afraid of is
Trump um stealing their democracy
they're worried about white supremacy
and the the militias up in the mountains
and all the all the white supremacy
that's in
[Music]
everything oh so Amazon separated the
hard
cover from the other two entities so
that if you look at one you won't
necessarily find the other two
perfect it's always something all right
so uh Democrats afraid of trump they're
afraid of all the white supremacy that's
uh they can't find any any of it in the
military they're afraid of climate
change and they're afraid of
Russia what do all those things have in
common Trump stealing your democracy
white supremacy and the militias up in
the hill uh climate change and
Russia what do they all have in common
can you see the the common
element none of them are
real they're literally things that if
you if you had not been told you should
be afraid of them you would never be
afraid of
them there is really zero chance that
Trump is going to steal your democracy
in the context of the Democrats already
stealing your democracy clearly the
elections have become just a cheaters
contest let's be honest our election
system is a cheaters contest I don't
know where all the cheating is but you
see election interference in every
 thing that happens everywhere
from you know both sides in different
ways so it's a cheating contest and to
imagine that Trump is the one that
steals your democracy that was probably
been gone since
1963 literally like literally no joke
it's not likely we have a democracy we
have something like the impression of a
democracy that's enough of an illusion
to keep the country together but I'm
pretty sure we don't have a lot to do
with who gets power and what happens and
in the biggest decisions
so somehow the Democrats have managed to
convince uh or the the press and the
propagandists have managed to convince
something like half the country that the
biggest things they should be afraid of
are all things that are good for the
people in
power let's see getting rid of trump
well that' be good for the people in
power because they want to be in charge
uh saying the white supremacy is the
problem well that would be good for the
people in power because it keeps Trump
out of office uh what about climate
change well that would be good for the
people in power because it means that a
trillion dollar will be heading their
Direction and for the all the the
services and the Technologies and the
companies that are pro- Democrat so that
would be good for them what about
Russia's the biggest fear oh the
military-industrial complex can make
lots more money if Russia is our enemy
than if we found a way to get along with
them so Democrats are living in a
completely fake fear world now here are
some things that I would consider real
things to be afraid of now I'm not
trying to make you afraid but I wanted
you to want you to contrast the reality
of these versus the complete fictional
fear of what the Democrats are living
under so these would be things that
Republicans would be concerned with
government censorship of what they call
disinformation which is really the end
of the first amendment and the end of
any kind of
Freedom that's what Republicans are
worried about is that real it's
completely real I mean it's documented
in so many ways you can't you know I
can't even mention them all but from the
Twitter files on we've seen that the
government has colluded with um the
media and platforms to censor and censor
the truth not just misin information
censor the truth and probably know
they're doing it so should you be afraid
of the loss of free speech well depends
if you think you ever had it what about
the fact that our food supply is
poison that bothers me a lot that's like
I don't know it'd be hard to come up
with a bigger problem than that
poisoning you with your food
supply um but that's a big issue
especially with RFK Jr part of the
pirate ship uh I'm worried about Dei I
think Dei is destroying the country it's
just destroying the fabric of the
country which was merit-based and now it
isn't a non-merit based system is
guaranteed to fail and I'm really
worried about that and that's very real
and we're seeing the mass incompetence
problem everywhere from the Secret
Service to you name it it's everywhere
I'm worried about the debt I have no
idea how to solve that no idea how to
solve it and it's terminal by the way if
we don't solve it we're all
dead um and I don't know how to solve it
and nobody has an idea
so that's a problem how about uh nuclear
war well I don't think it's an imminent
problem but it's one that I worry about
um how about the supply chain breaking
down that's a really big problem
especially if a ran gets into a fighting
War more directly with Israel or the
United States they've already threatened
to turn off the oil and and maybe block
the straight of Horus or we think they
would I don't know if they've threatened
that so I worry about the supply chain I
worry about the next pandemic that
um may be coming along I worry about the
population decline the birth rate
problem in the United States I worry
about that I worry about energy shortage
that's driven by having too many robots
and too much Ai and self-driving cars
and then we don't have enough energy to
keep the lights on I worry about that a
lot how about uh how about foreign
countries hacking our infrastructure and
being able to turn off our lights in our
water anytime they want I worry about
that I'm pretty sure that's real
according to uh the FBI it looks like
China is already hacked into everything
and they can just turn us off when they
want that's a problem
um and of course I worry about the Deep
State controlling the world uh the
country so I feel like those are pretty
well documented easily defended obvious
real
fears here's what I put zero fear into
Trump stealing my democracy white
supremacy
milias that nobody can find climate
change and Russia wanting to attack US
unless we attack them I mean if if we
keep going after Russia enough then it
becomes a problem but I don't think it's
a problem if we're just waiting
around all right I'm getting a
confirmation that's still just hard
cover that's available on
Amazon so just think of that so A bunch
of you went to Amazon to check my claim
and you came back with different stories
about what is available and what's not
you can't even tell if you can buy my
book just think about that the a number
of you went to check just to see if my
book is available for sale and you can't
tell you can't tell some of you say it
is and some of you say it definitely
isn't the hard cover is definitely is is
available wow well dog mhof is in
trouble but I don't think any Democrats
will care or hear about it
allegedly uh in 2020 in 2012 he slapped
his girlfriend for flirting at some
party where they were all drunk she
allegedly hit him back uh no file no
charges were filed some say allegedly he
paid $80,000 to make the story go away I
don't know if that's
confirmed um so the Daily Mail says they
have three sources I
guess now if you look at the way the
media is handling it so far the the
biggest part of the
media the biggest part the media is only
uh kind of ignoring
it so I don't think Democrats will even
hear it or if they do they'll think it
must be a nothing from the
past um but Chris Cuomo news Nation he
did do a little video piece in which he
said that if this had been Trump who had
done these things or anyone close to him
it would just be the only
news to which I say that sounds about
right yeah
yeah so we're going to get the
completely different treatment because
it's him now um I love the fact that
uh that MSNBC in particular was trying
to turn wals and Doug mhof into the new
model of
masculinity and then you find that the
new model of mascul the new model of
masculinity slapped around a girlfriend
uh got the I think it's was The Nanny
the same girlfriend I think it's the
same person right got her
pregnant yeah so there's your new model
of masculinity that didn't work out the
way anybody
hoped bill maluan is talking about the
northern border so apparently just in
three states on our northern border so
this is this is not the entire northern
border just three states uh Vermont New
York and New Hampshire and keep in mind
that yeah just three states and uh
currently according to the border patrol
they got 19,000 illegal immigrants in
2024 so far that's higher than the
previous 17 years combined and they came
from 97 different countries now how many
got through if 19,000 got
caught but only in three states that
border so we got a whole bunch of states
that border
Canada that's a
lot how many terrorists do you think are
inside the
country if I were
Iran let me tell you how I would build a
defense against the United States and I
don't think I'm giving them ideas
because this is sort of obvious if our
borders are open you would sneak as many
operatives as you
could and any one motivated operative
with a little bit of Weaponry that
doesn't seem too hard to
get could do horrible damage horrible
damage
and again I'm not going to give many
ideas um oh you I think my wind bigley
the first edition you're still seeing in
various forms it's the second edition
that's not available in all its
forms anyway so I would expect that if
we have war with Iran suddenly the
lights are going to go out in the United
States so yeah and I suppose it depends
how bad things get but if we took out or
Israel let's say Israel took out the oil
refineries in Iran which basically
eliminated their way to essentially
eliminate their economy they wouldn't be
able to survive I think they would turn
the lights off in the United States I
think you literally wouldn't have
electricity and I think that they have
the ability to do that either through
physical sabotage or
hacking and here's the thing I wonder
if something that big did happen to us
in the United States there's there's no
restraint that we would use to make sure
it didn't happen again so that would end
Iran as an independent nation in my
opinion if they turned off the lights in
the United States and it you know we
couldn't get them back on and it caused
a 100,000 people to die just from the
lack of electricity which is possible by
the way you could have 100,000 people
die if that happened even we judged well
we were a little bit responsible for you
maybe poking the bear some people would
say and other would others would say no
we're just responding to them poking us
all the time we' never get to the bottom
of that but if something that radical
happened on the
Homeland I think the US Military and
Israel would essentially just colonize
Iran and just take over the government
there what at whatever cost I think at
any cost we would do it at that point
point so that's probably the only thing
that's keeping Iran or China or anybody
else from turning off our lights because
it does seem we're super vulnerable the
only thing that we have is not that
we're protecting our facilities or even
our borders the only thing we have is
that if somebody does it we're going to
find out who you
are and we're going to make sure that
everybody who's ever close to you is
dead so that's the only protecting us
right
now yeah there's a bunch of counterfeit
um versions of all my books so for all
of my books as soon as I get published
there'll be all these counterfeits so
hold this in your mind Ju Just Just hold
this truth so on
Amazon I can only get my hard cover
published because they give me technical
problems that they can't solve and
there's no mechanism to solve it for the
soft cover and the Kindle but how many
counterfeit versions of my book did they
approve and you can buy them
today a
lot people just massively print
counterfeit versions of my book and they
won't take them down but the real one
they won't put up and I'm worried that
the reason I can't publish the real one
is because the counterfeits have already
taken the space meaning that they the
the system probably says oh that book
already exists but it would be the
counterfeits so I worry that that's the
problem or it's just political it'd be a
big coincidence if it
isn't well do you know how California
had that new law that said that
disinformation was going to be illegal
especially political disinformation and
you could go to jail for a political
parody and it turns out that a uh
federal court has uh tossed that out
it's unconstitutional so the California
ban on Election related quote
misinformation looks like that's just
going away so thank goodness there are
still some courts that
operate we don't have much going on
going for us
but
fortunately well here's some good news
um uh October is so lit when it comes to
all the election stuff the the things
that it looks like maybe people waited
to tell you
but here's one did you know well you did
know that the Republican the
RNC where uh uh Lara Trump and uh who is
she working with she's got
a she has a co-chairman person Michael
Watley so Laura Trump and Michael Watley
um in case you're wondering if they've
been
busy you're wondering hey is that orang
getting anything done listen to
this so apparently the
RNC has recruited and trained hundreds
of thousands of volunteers thousands of
attorneys and I have already held
thousands of
trainings ahead of the
election so that the total number of
volunteers is
220,000 and they've had over over 2,000
trainings and they've got 5,000
attorneys
recruited 5,000 attorneys
220,000 volunteers and they've had 2,000
training sessions does that sound like
they're working
hard sure
does sure does now it's impossible to
know from a distance you know how much
of this is needed and whether you got
enough but these are big numbers
so remember I told you months ago I said
that the the wild card and all of this
the election might be Lara Trump's level
of
aggressiveness in terms of how
aggressively are you going to make sure
that cheating doesn't happen this time
this is aggressive now Michael Watley
gets of course credit as well that's a
they they're their
team but I have nothing to complain
about here
do you feel the same does this feel like
this is a serious no joke we're really
going to try to fix this problem don't
know if it's enough don't know if
they'll be observing in a way that can
make a difference but
wow this is the best news I think I've
heard in a long time my perfect scenario
goes like
this Democrats massively
cheat Republicans catch the cheat in
time
and it's enough to redo How We Do
elections in other words we'll learn
that our elections have too many holes
cuz we we'll catch too many problems I
don't
think it's practical that we're going to
have an actual election result unless
unless Trump wins by Landslide and the
Democrats decide
uncharacteristically they decide it was
a clean election so I think what you're
going to
see is that Dem rats will be questioning
the election if they lose even by a
landslide and they'll say Russia
interfered they'll do all the normal
things and they'll try to put Trump in
jail so we're just getting going and
we're only the third of
October um oh look it's another
coincidence oh look at all the
coincidences happening in October right
before the election here's a coincidence
according to uh Scott presler who's a
signing people up to vote in in uh
Pennsylvania doing an amazing job um
this Saturday Trump is going to come
back to Pennsylvania to that Butler Farm
Show Place the same place he uh almost
was
assassinated so imagine how much press
he's going to get and how much
pennsylvanians will be paying attention
when Trump goes right back to the very
place where somebody took a shot at him
right that that naturally will be
just complete press saturation there's
no way they can ignore it and it'll make
you think if you're a republican it's
really going to make you think to vote
it's really going to make you think to
register if you haven't because
Pennsylvania is the key thing so not
only is Pennsylvania the key state but
by coincidence it's a it's a place where
he got shot at and almost killed shot
actually
and here's a coincidence you
you'll never guess turns out that the
Pennsylvania voter registration website
is going to be unavailable for
maintenance that evening from 6:00 pm.
which is 1 hour after the
rally to midnight so the exact period of
time where people would be thinking
about Pennsylvania thinking about voting
thinking about
registering that's when the system won't
be
available the one time that Trump goes
back to Pennsylvania to that same place
the one time he's going to get the most
press and the most
attention they're going to do a little
maintenance on the system so you can't
register
then coincidence it could be it could be
that the maintenance was scheduled long
before the the baller
thing
but don't you think it looks like
election interference
if you wanted to make it not election
interference you know in the let's let's
say they scheduled it a year ago so
there's nothing there's nothing weird
about it once you knew that Trump was
going to be in
berler shouldn't you change
it shouldn't you re couldn't you
reschedule it couldn't you do it maybe
after
midnight I don't know I got questions
I'm not I'm not willing to say this was
done specifically to depress Trump
voters from registering I'm going to say
that if you knew it's going to be a
problem you should reschedule so if they
don't well then that looks a little
slippery meanwhile according to the
Gateway pundit you know we've got this
big uh question mark about uh overseas
votes these would be Americans who are
allowed to vote they just happen to be
overseas so there's a big program by the
uh Democrats to make sure that those
overseas voters are definitely voting as
many as
possible uh it's called the uni the uh
uniformed overseas citizens absentee
Voting
Act and so the Democrats are going to
really really uh they put money into
it and they're going to go look and make
sure that all those people voted do you
see any possible problems with
that no what what's wrong with making
sure people vote how could that possibly
be a problem I you are so suspicious no
they're they just want to make sure
everybody has a right to vote and that's
available and Nothing Stops people from
expressing their Democratic preferences
so stop thinking there's some like plot
or or it's obvious that there's
something sketchy going on there's no
evidence of that whatsoever no evidence
at all let's see uh they're trying to
win approximately they say there are 9
million Americans
that are overseas and could vote some
percentage of them so they're working on
that 9 million the only problem is uh
there are only 2.8 million of them that
are of voting age and can vote and live
overseas so they're going to they're
working to get 9 million votes out of
the 2.8 million wait a minute okay which
is a bigger
number nine is bigger than 2.8 right so
they're only 2.8
are of the right age and also are
overseas but they're trying to get 9
million votes out of the 2.8 million
okay I take back everything I said uh
you should really really worry about
that now this is coming from the Gateway
pundit and various sources and do I know
that there's something sketchy here well
this is one of those cases where you'd
want to hear the
counterargument so the the accus ation
is that they're very clearly signaling
that they're going to get way more votes
from overseas than there are human
beings who are eligible to vote
overseas so it does feel
like the setup is being broadcast to us
you can see it coming from a mile away
unless they have an explanation and
maybe they have different data about
who's overseas and what they expect to
do maybe
but do you trust that does this look
innocent to you it doesn't look innocent
to
me now one would
hope one would hope that the Lara Trump
Michael wle RNC people have some way to
get extra visibility into that process I
don't know what that would look like but
there's got to be some way to see the
votes opened up or something
we'll see maybe if that's completely una
auditable we got a
problem meanwhile uh judge Chuck Ken has
unsealed Jack Smith's new uh
indictment uh and this is the one that
it got on all the the lawfare stuff I'm
the worst person to listen to so I'll
tell you what I think I know the only
the only thing you can get out of my
analysis of the law pair of stuff is
that somebody who watches the news
doesn't even understand it like I I do
this literally every day I check all the
news stories and my brain just turns off
when I look at the legal stuff partly
because it's always just so boring and
partly because you you know if you're
not a lawyer you can't really understand
which parts are important and which
parts are just formalities and which
parts will be overturned so you don't
have to worry about them you know it's
hard for me to dig in so look for the
actual lawyers you know the Jonathan
tures and the dtz you know look look for
the people uh who've done
this uh to give you a better look but
here's what I think is true from a non-
lawyer stupid
perspective it looks to me like it's
another oh it's a coincidence what a
coincidence that this dropped just
before the election and we won't have
time to know that let's say the uh
accusations turn out to be false and
let's say there's a court process and
let's say that Trump is completely
exonerated well you're not going to know
that by election day because by
coincidence this drops just in time to
to Poison the Well and make people think
who there's with all of this action 165
pages there must be something there now
my understanding is that
um this was Rewritten because of the
presidential immunity decision at the
Supreme Court which said that if Trump
did something under the official Banner
of his office he had some
immunity uh so apparently it's being
Rewritten to emphasize the things he did
which they're defining as outside the
scope of His official office for example
they talk about his tweeting in his
personal account as opposed to his
presidential account because is using
the personal one would be a sign that
he's doing it knowing he's doing it and
will side of the presidential you know
umbrella does any of that matter I don't
know you'd have to talk to a lawyer not
me but um you've got this totally biased
prosecutor you've got this totally left
leading judge and they just dropped this
thing that cannot be defended there's
just no defense against it because it's
complicated and people just say well
there's something there with all that
smoke there must be fire but of course
the play is cre lots of smoke so that
people think there's a
fire so during the election season it is
not true that with all that smoke there
must be fire that's just not true during
an election season it's just true that
it could be but in the non-election
context a whole bunch of smoke probably
tells you there's a fire and the
election season doesn't mean anything it
just means somebody's making an
accusation
um so I tried to figure out just exactly
what was in that thing and as far as I
can tell it's mostly somebody called it
hearsay meaning that it's bunch of
people who were acting in ways that
maybe they thought were compatible with
what Trump wanted but there doesn't seem
to be anything that Trump said or did
directly that would be illegal as far as
I know now this is too preliminary to
know that that was a true statement so
I'm waiting for the news to surface you
know what's the thing we need to know
can you give me the quote that says
Trump did something haven't seen it I've
seen a bunch of quotes that other people
thought they were doing other things but
here's my big question about the whole
situation everything that Trump did on
January 6 and this is this is all about
the January 6 business um everything you
did in order for it to look like it was
against the
law would require you to know that he
knew the election was
clean that's the trick they're playing
on the country and Democrats are falling
for it Democrats actually believe you
can me you can measure the temperature
of the
earth
accurately and they believe that you can
know if an American election was clean
or not
I don't know how dumb you'd have to be
to believe either of those two
things but super dumb there is no way to
know if an American election was clean
you can know if somebody had a specific
complaint and there was time and
standing to pursue it you could know how
the coure
ruled but there's no way to know that
there's is or is not something hidden in
the system that was changing the result
how do you know what you don't know
you don't hey look there's a giant pile
of
hay somebody said there might be a
needle in it how do you judge there's no
needle in
it well I don't see a needle no court
has decided there's a needle you can't
prove there's a needle but then I say
but you also can't prove there's not a
needle because you're not even looking
for it well why would I look for
something that is unspecific well that's
my point how would you know if there was
something in the system that was
corrupting it if you didn't look well
nobody's complained there's no court
case I know this had nothing to do with
my point how would you know that some
State actor maybe with some insiders
hadn't done something how would you know
there weren't some male carriers who got
together and said let's just throw away
all the mail from the the red
neighborhoods how would you know there
is no way to know those things unless
somebody came forward as a
whistleblower or just somebody got
lucky there is no way to know and our
systems are designed to make sure you
can't know now if there's only one thing
you ever learn you should learn that the
system the way a system is designed will
tell you the intentions of the designers
but not on day one on day one it could
just be poorly designed
and then you go oh okay they didn't mean
for the machine to not
work that was just a
mistake if it's 10 years later and and
the Machine is still doing the wrong
thing you can no longer say that's an
accident at some point and we're well
beyond that point at some point it's the
design
intention because you would fix it if it
were not the design intention right so
that's why you can't tell in the first
place but is obvious it is now obvious
very obvious completely obvious and by
the way you will never see anybody
debunk this
point there's your dog not barking
you'll see people say there was no proof
of fraud
true there's no proof of fraud that a
court accepted oh let me put it that way
there's no court accepted proof of a
2020 fraud doesn't mean
anything it doesn't mean you didn't have
any fraud
yeah your our systems are designed to
make sure you can't tell and that's
really
obvious so
um what else is going on so my main
point there is that uh I've got this
question about the latest um Jack Smith
indictment stuff how much of that
depends on Trump's inner thoughts
as in if Trump knew because they like to
say he knew the election that he lost
the election don't let anybody say that
in front of you if somebody says he knew
he lost the election just get all over
him and say how the could you know
the unknowable how do you know you you
couldn't even describe how the election
is put
together and then you go into why do we
have voting machines at
all so
I think the entire January 6 hoax and
I'm going to call it a hoax The
hoax is that we know what Trump
knows or that he could know whether the
election was clean or not to me it seems
obvious that he really believed it was
rigged which would make 100% of his
actions make
sense because if he thought it was
rigged and he was trying to fix that
problem that would be doing what the
President should do but on top of that
even if he did it as a private citizen
it's what a private citizen should do a
private citizen should try to fix a
problem with the with the
system if you had the power as a citizen
you weren't elected to anything and you
saw that there was some big thing that
you could fix what's your responsibility
as a citizen fix it fix it it's not your
job but it's definitely your
responsibility as as it would be for all
of us like the
flood the the flood is you know sort of
the government's job and FEMA the one
supposed to be doing it but you've seen
a bunch of people said what the hell
this isn't getting done so they're
taking their own helicopters and raising
their own money you know trying to get
their own uh you know internet
connections in there and stuff so
citizens do have a responsibility to fix
things that are
broken so whether Trump was operating
under the banner of hisob job or
independent of his job that didn't
change the fact that it was his job as a
citizen not a paid job not an elected
job but as a citizen absolutely he he's
supposed to go fix that if he's the one
in a position where it makes most sense
for him to do it if I were in the
position where I could fix that I would
feel that was my job an unpaid job but
it would certainly be my patriotic duty
to try to fix it
so yes don't let anybody make you think
past the sale the sale they have to make
is how do you know that
Trump could somehow know the unknowable
that it was a clean election when it
looked like it wasn't that's not
knowable don't let anybody make you
think past that well there's more Diddy
updates I keep seeing videos of Jaguar
Wright who is a musician
herself and she claims have all kinds of
inside information about diddies parties
Etc she said she used to be a sex worker
and so she sees the world from you know
the the darkest corners and she was also
part of Diddy's world so she's seen you
know the entire field she
claims and here are the things that
she's
saying um that there were in fact
Satanic rituals again this is just a
claim uh I would put her credibility
as a coin
flip I I'm not sure that I lean toward
her being accurate on
everything but it does sound accurate I
have to admit it has that there is a
ring of truth to it I just don't know if
all of it's
true so i' take with a big big grain of
salt this particular
Source uh but it's worth listening
to so she says that young girls were
stuffed into suitcases and later
discarded in
Alleyways you'd think there somebody
would ask a follow-up question on that
oh hold on hold on young girls put in
what
suitcases and then you take the suitcase
to the
alley wa are they alive in the
suitcase and why'd you put them in the
suitcase and if they were
dead why'd you put them in an alley so
so that's the sort of accusation where I
say hm
Satanic rituals probably
not girls stuffed into
suitcases if I had heard it happen
once I might have said well that's
terrible but it could happen once but if
you're saying it's sort of a routine
thing to stuff girls and suitcases and
drop them in alleys that's a little less
credible
sounding um she implicated Jay-Z saying
he has hundreds of victims there's not
yet any uh solid evidence of that and
then she goes this far she says there's
some Sinister web that ties together
Diddy Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey
Epstein okay I'm out I'm
out two on the
nose is that a little bit
convenient just a little bit too
perfect oh it CL cleverly ties together
all these loose ends now it could I'm
not ruling it
out I mean stranger things have happened
but it's a little bit too exactly like
what people are expecting you know in
their conspiracy
theories and uh she says that Diddy was
a product of Music Mogul Clive Davis and
Lucian gra never heard of him and taught
him everything he
knows well interestingly last night I
was watching a Whitney Houston
documentary that involves Clive Davis
discovering her and uh according to the
documentary Clive Davis is just the
nicest guy and man can he help your
career because he's a nice guy just a
nice nice guy
so do I believe that version of
him no because
honestly almost nobody is that nice
if he's as nice as he was in the movie
he's really nice that that would be one
seriously nice guy and maybe he is maybe
he is so I'm not willing to go so far as
to throw any of these characters under
the bus I think we can throw didy under
the bus with some confidence but all the
other names I'm really
uncomfortable assuming that there's
actual evidence of crimes there might
be there might be I mean there's 120
alleged victims
according to one attorney so how big
this could get we don't know but don't
assume that some big celebity name you
heard is necessarily going to be
guilty well Israel is uh supposedly
going to Target in the next day or so uh
maybe Iranian nuclear
facilities
maybe um oil
facilities and uh Israel did just today
I guess strike a Russian Air Base in
Syria now the reason is that some
weapons for Hezbollah were allegedly in
an airplane that landed there so they
were really going they weren't going
after Russians they were going after the
Hezbollah supply line but uh they
haven't done that
before so it attacked the warehouses it
was trying not to kill too many people
apparently and Russian air defenses
tried to intercept the isra missiles so
it was a missile attack and they
failed so does that tell you anything
does that tell you that Israeli missiles
are better than Russian air defenses or
does it maybe tell you that Russia has
to use all their good stuff in
Ukraine is it possible that the Syrian U
military assets are just all the the
crap stuff left over that didn't go to
Ukraine maybe don't know
but certainly Israel has demonstrated
that they can reach anything and they
have demonstrated
by
basically not having any damage from 200
rocket or 200 was it InterContinental
missiles that got sent at them from Iran
with no damage really to speak of I mean
nothing major so so we're in that uh
that weird area where everybody's
posturing and they've got to make sure
that they look strong and they they made
a defense but they didn't go too far
because you don't want a bigger War so
everybody's trying to balance on the the
head of the needle
here so what would you think is are they
going to attack is Israel going to
attack the nuclear facilities which
would slow down Iran's ability to have a
breakout nuclear thing uh with nuclear
weapons or would they go after something
that's more directly related to their
economic weal
being so if they go after the oil
terminals Iran has said they'll go after
all the oil terminals in the area so the
entire world will be out of oil would
they do
that don't
know there there's a real good chance
they
wouldn't because if they took out all
the oil facilities in the Middle East
that would make every country in the
Middle East say does uh anybody want a
little help destroying Iran uh we'll
we'll send some
people I mean I can't imagine that the
other the neighboring countries would
put up with that you know is Saudi
Arabia going to put up with that I mean
I think that's that's World War I now I
think World War II would still be
limited to the Middle East mostly except
for terrorist acts in other countries
but I feel like I feel like Israel
probably won't go after the oil
refineries because that would be too
much for shock to the whole world but if
they go after the nuclear facilities and
that's all they go after and let's say
they succeed in slowing it down then
they get a definite
benefit uh and they get a might not
spread it might be the least likely to
spread to a larger field and um and they
could say that they
responded so I guess I would bet on that
as the first most likely thing they
would do is take out the nuclear thing
because if they take out the nuclear
threat the threat that Iran can make a
nuclear weapon in two weeks which by the
way is the estimate that they're about
that if they wanted to they could have a
nuclear weapon in two weeks do you know
what I say about
that if Iran could have a nuclear weapon
in two weeks which by the way I'm not
sure that that's true but if they could
have it in two weeks they already have
one how how the hell would we
know if they had a nuclear weapon
already if the experts were saying they
could make one in two weeks if they
wanted to are you telling me they could
make one in two weeks if they wanted to
and they didn't make one they've had two
weeks in what world does a country not
secretly make an actual nuclear
weapon that would be insane they should
make it as fast as possible and tell
everybody they got one or at least
suggest it so that you don't know if
they can attack with a nuke or not now I
suppose Israel's intelligence would
probably be good enough that they would
know if they had a breakout nuclear
weapon but uh if I were Iran I hate to
say it but I would have made the nuclear
weapon
already so there's that uh then there's
the thought that if Iran got into a
general War like a big wider War where
really the you know the mainland of Iran
was under
attack that they don't have enough uh
manufacturing ability to replace their
weapons after a fairly you know intense
fight so if they use most of their
weapons fighting they don't have a way
to rebuild them fast enough to stay in
the fight and the only place they could
get them would be Russia and Russia is
not likely to send them a lot of weapons
at the same time they're trying to use
them in
Ukraine so Iran is probably not capable
of a sustained war that it could
win um so these are all the
variables now I haven't heard the news
talking about a decapitation attack and
given that Israel has shown that they'll
take out the leaders of Hezbollah and
Hamas if they
can um do you think that would really
stop from taking up the leadership of
Iran I feel like it's on the table it
seems a lot safer than taking out the
the oil facilities if you take out the
oil facilities it's War for sure if you
take out the
leadership I don't know maybe it's worse
I don't know how to judge that
one but most importantly there's uh the
BBC reports there's some science that
scientists have made a a huge
breakthrough in analyzing the brain of a
fly now even a fly has a super
complicated brain but it's a tiny little
brain and way way less complicated than
you know bigger mammals but they think
they've made this big breakthrough and
sort of mapping it almost like
physically building a map of how all the
neurons connect to the other ones and uh
it's the most detailed analysis of the
brain of an adult creature ever produced
now what they don't say is that it's the
first step in understanding why
Democrats vote the way they do you got
to start with the fly but then you work
your your way up so it's like fly
salamander Democrat no I'm just joking
I'm just joking I kid the Democrats now
they're like everybody else except
they're afraid of things that don't
exist well meta has these new smart
glasses um that you can wear with some
VR
capabilities and uh some people combined
that with an app called uh Pim eyes
that can do facial
recognition and it'll allow you to walk
through a crowd and the personal
information of everybody you look at
will pop up on your
glasses so you'll know the name and
address and social media history and
they say phone numbers but I don't know
where they get that so you can actually
see the phone number of somebody as you
walk past them in a crowd total
strangers now is that going to stay
illegal
probably probably but imagine going to a
party wearing your nerd glasses and you
could tell who's
single suppose that's the only thing you
knew you could tell who's single just by
looking at him suppose you could tell
their job just by looking at them
suppose you could tell how much money
they have just by looking at them with
your glasses that's all
happening that's all happening
so my little life where uh most of the
time I'm
Anonymous it's about to end really
quickly you know if I leave my my small
town here and I don't run into somebody
who watches the show every day I'm kind
of anonymous like if I go to an airport
I'm not usually recognized sometimes not
usually now all it would take is a few
people with those glasses on and they're
going to ID me right away so does that
change my life I don't know it might
might change my life
radically yours
too um apparently the Doctor Who
prescribed the drugs for Matthew Perry
that he died of an overdose of has plad
guilty according to the
BBC so there were two doctors involved
one had some facility that had
ketamine uh and the other was his doctor
so I guess his doctor was working with
the source doctor so none of it was
illegal in terms of the doctoring but I
think the the amount that they got and
the way it was distributed the way it
was the way it was ingested there are
the questions there I guess but
uh here's the part that was just really
scary so according to the
indictment uh the the two doctors
involved they were exchanging text
trying to figure out how to get this
drug to to Matthew Perry and uh they're
trying to figure out how much to charge
him and one of the doctors said and I
quote I wonder how much this will
pay those are the
doctors the doctors the people who were
responsible for
keeping Matthew Perry
alive were wondering how to rob him and
calling him a
wow if I can make any advice to the
medical professionals uh who are
watching now I wouldn't ever call any of
your customers
morons because you never know when
that's going to get discovered I feel
like all of our messages are
discoverable and at some point they'll
all be available publicly everywhere
that seems inevitable
but maybe don't do that yeah don't don't
be like
that meanwhile according to the
independent the US Army is rolling in a
robot dog with a gun on
it and uh we've talked about this before
we got robot dogs with
flamethrowers we've got uh every kind of
drone and now we have uh robot dogs with
guns fitted at the top well you know I
want one of
those uh if anybody's thinking about a
good Christmas pres to send
me at the top of the list is a robot dog
to defend my house now here's where
we're going with us these These are
actually being deployed in war zones now
so
Ukraine the Ukrainian military is going
to be seeing robot dogs with guns and
flamethrowers coming over the hedge
r that is not going to be a fun battle
I'll tell you so we've now entered the
we've now entered the age in which
humans are going to fight
robots that's here because already the
ukrainians are using their robots to you
know breach the front lines and shoot
the Russians so we now have humans
fighting
robots it's real it's
now the question is this how long will
it be before both sides are just all
robots now if if major power fights a
smaller power it's going to be the major
Powers robots against the humans of the
smaller power and the humans won't have
a chance you know assuming that the
superpower has lots of money to make
lots of robots humans won't have a
chance but what happens if two
superpowers that can make unlimited
robots get in a war with each other
would it ever make sense for the US and
China to be in a war in which we put
humans on the front
line if we could if we could send
unlimited drones and unlimited robot
dogs wouldn't you just have the robots
fight the
robots it's just going to be battlebot
right and then what happens when one of
the robot sides
wins does the other side say whoa whoa
whoa we're not going to put our humans
against your robots and you've already
beat the robots we
surrender it's going to be like that
Star Trek where they would do a
simulation of the war so they didn't
have to have the actual war and then
whoever lost the simulation of the war
had to volunteer to be basically
suicided you know in some humane
way I think we're actually heading to
that place like actually
literally where after the robot war is
over the losers have to accept the
penalty whatever that penalty is could
be slavery
anyway so you might all want your own
robot dog to guard your house and uh
also the Second Amendment is going to
get a little
dicey if the Second Amendment says you
can own a
gun what's it going to say about your
robot dog with a machine gun mounted on
it or or let's say it's a
singleshot sort of a home defense weapon
but it's mounted on a robot do we have
laws that will handle robots with guns
and uh if the robot becomes
sensient is it your fault if the robot
uses the gun to Sho somebody because it
would be the robot's
decision I don't
know so that's what I got for you today
I'm going to take a little time to talk
to the uh locals people on their
own and
uh once we get that going um
anyway so we going to talk to locals if
you're on X or YouTube or Rumble thanks
for joining it'll take about 20 seconds
to be private with the locals
people so that's when we do our
interstitial
