well i just remembered that i forgot to
tweet that youtube would be
live too so you might have a smaller
audience than usual
smaller audience but really better
in many ways
and congratulations on making here
because this is the best thing that'll
ever happen to you in your whole damn
life
and to make it even better all you need
is a couple of my girl glasses a tanker
cello sue stein a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
the dopamine hit of the day some people
call it
syphinosis
it's called the simultaneous step it
happens now go
ah
that is some good hypnosis right there
can you taste the persuasion i think you
can i think you can
well are you surprised that i'm here
anybody
because i did my best to get canceled
yesterday
here i am
here i am
now
in case anybody missed it
i was essentially taking a challenge
the challenge was that i could say
things that violated the main the
mainstream narrative about vaccinations
and even and i tossed in the
election of 2016 just to make it extra
dangerous
so i violated the narrative i think
maybe harder than anybody's ever
violated it
at least according to my viewers i said
i did i did succeed in violating the
narrative
still here
still here
didn't get even demonetized and i get
demonetized for all kinds of stuff
didn't get demonetized
and
did not get a strike
did not get a warning
nothing
nothing now i predicted that that would
be the case
despite
being a fairly high profile
you know
pundit who talks about stuff in public
now how many of you would accept that
the test showed something
you know it's not a science so you can't
make any hard conclusions about it but
would you but would you say the the
demonstration was
useful
i don't know if it conclusive is a
little bit too much to say but was it
useful
yeah colin i hear you
not yet not yet okay well maybe i'll get
cancelled later
um
so
a lot of the uh
a lot of the concern that i'm getting
from both the reasonable critics and the
unreasonable ones is that i talk too
much about
covid
and on top of that
too much about my own critics would you
say that's fair
fair criticism
i i agree with that completely
but have you seen the news lately
do you know what the do you know what
the the biggest news story is today
is snowed
that's it
that's it that's all this happening the
biggest news story today is snowed
we'll talk about that in a little bit
i would like to
tell you that unfortunately since i talk
about the headlines
i'm a little bit captive to what's going
on there and i would talk a lot less
about myself
i hope
if if something interesting were going
on in the world
but there isn't
at the moment i mean it'll heat up i
mean this is going to be a good year
2022 will be lit for politics
but
um let me let me
give you one partial defense
when i'm talking about the pandemic i
don't feel like i'm talking about the
pandemic
and apparently that's not getting
through
do you know what i mean by that
that all of my pandemic talk
you know unless i'm just like telling
you some new update or something but
when i'm talking about the you know the
meat of it and how we deal with it it's
not really about the pandemic
at all
it should be
about how we determine who's
hallucinating
and who is thinking clearly
that that's what it's supposed to be
about
if i have confused you
to make you think that i am either
persuading you to do or not do something
in the pandemic none of that's happening
none of that is happening or at least
intentionally
i don't have an intention or a
really even a motivation
to give you medical advice or or
anything like that
so none of that's happening
but
uh there is a fascinating thing that's
happening at the moment that does
involve me
i'm in the middle of something that i
consider fascinating but to be honest i
don't know if you will
if i can be honest
everything's more fascinating when it
affects you personally
but
i believe
you will learn something
as i talk about this today
so i think you're going to see something
that may open your eyes a little bit
and it will look like i'm just defending
against my critics and there's some of
that
certainly
but i'm going to go a little deeper
and try to teach you something that's
seriously useful
okay so if you stick with me
you're gonna hear some topics you're
sick of and god i'm sick of them
i am so sick
i don't even want to hear the word
vaccination again for the rest of my
life
we're all sick of it
but my promise will be
if you stick with me
i'm going to give you at least one
really really useful tip
for discerning what's real and what
isn't
so just stay with me see if i can
deliver that okay
but first some other things
um i saw a tweet from michael sokolow on
twitter he says it's interesting how nbc
is plugging the quote
winter olympics
and apparently they're not mentioning
that it's in beijing or china
so nbc is maybe
at least allegedly we don't know what's
in their minds
but
and michael goes on to say even the
graphic they're showing has a big winter
olympics with only a small
beijing
in the lower corner
now
have we reached a point where
willingly doing business with china
is embarrassing
yes or no have we reached the point
where an american company doing business
with china is literally embarrassing
yeah yeah we're there
it's literally a corporate embarrassment
to do business with china
now i feel sorry for nbc because you
know they make these deals
years in advance
i imagine probably four years ago they
knew they would handle the olympics
maybe they could have seen the signs
then but
this is going to be i think a ratings
disaster
is that is that a pretty safe
um prediction
do you think we'll be surprised and the
ratings will be
sort of normal
i feel like it's going to be at least in
america i think it's going to be a
disaster
we'll see
um
china's got really big problems right
now
i don't know if i've ever seen a country
with bigger problems so they've got that
default of the big real estate company
going on over there they've got a
demographic bomb they you know they're
being blamed for the coronavirus they've
got the uyghurs so now they've got a
giant
karma problem
uyghur uighur karma
if the hashtag
uighur
karma ever gets traction
i don't know even the government could
fall in china i know that seems really
really unlikely
that the entire government could fall
but it could it could
uh rasmussen is uh did a poll
and they were asking people about their
opinions of the fbi
and apparently 46 percent either feel
strongly or somewhat
agreeing with roger stone
in the following sentence now this will
blow you away a little bit
this will blow you away
this is the united states public and 46
of them agree with roger stone
quote that a group of politicized thugs
at the top of the fbi
who are using it are using it as biden's
personal gestapo
so the thought that biden uses the fbi
as his personal gestapo
is agreed to somewhat or
or a lot
by 46 percent of the public
46 percent of the public
thinks it's fair to liken the fbi to the
gestapo
how many of you would agree with that
i think all 46 percent of you are on my
live stream right now
pretty wide agreement yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes yes
you know this is exactly the kind of uh
accusation that i usually avoid
all right
is that fair
maybe maybe i don't that may be my own
self-image but i like to stay out of the
this group is like hitler and that group
is like hitler and who's like the
holocaust i don't like to get in any of
that stuff it's just that's sort of what
you argue when you run out of argument
but
i find that uh characterization
you know hyperbolic of course but not
untrue
you know it feels like a hyperbolic way
to say it hyperbole
but
it isn't too far from what i see
to me it does look like biden
has some control over the fbi and that
they are doing some of his bidding
and that would look very disturbing
now we don't know
we don't know but maybe
elizabeth holmes who is on trial for
uh defrauding people i guess
got found guilty on
several of the charges and looks like
she's got some serious jail time or
fines coming
and i don't know that there's much to
say about this
john carroll says in the comments the
other 54 don't know what the gestapo is
no you're not totally wrong there
um
you know i'm only mentioning the
elizabeth holmes story because it's in
the news
but there's nothing interesting about it
is there
um she broke the law she got caught she
got prosecuted i think that's the whole
story
now there is definitely an element to
this of how in the world did she
convince
so many people that she was legitimate
i think that elizabeth holmes convinced
more smart people that she was real than
just about anybody
how'd she do it
is it because
she's female
now i don't think it was the sex appeal
per se
i didn't see her really selling sex she
whenever i saw her she was dressed
conservatively etc
i think it's because she
is a woman
not because of the sex part you know i
don't think necessarily the
you know any sexual interest is why
people believed her
but how many how many investors
do you think would
love to have a successful female
entrepreneur in their portfolio
i think it was a portfolio decision
that they all need a they need a
successful black person
that they're funding so they can say
they are
which is not a bad impulse right you
want your
activities to have some correlation with
the demographic of the country on
average on average not every person
every time
but to me this looks like a
gender preference thing
meaning that there were so many people
who knew they hadn't invested enough in
women's
startups
that they probably were just primed to
throw money at her as soon as she looked
legitimate
unfortunately she wasn't totally
legitimate
so that's that whole story they're
interesting uh
part of the epstein
gillane maxwell story so apparently
when epstein did a settlement back in
2000
whatever
2009
he paid half a million dollars to i
guess
virginia
jeff jeffries accusations
and
apparently part of that agreement
because it was a civil lawsuit
is that it would uh basically keep
everybody else quiet and they wouldn't
be able to sue or something like that
in other words
we we may have a perfect
uh concealment of the truth
so you got epstein who's dead
you've got glade maxwell whose records
are sealed
and now it looks like there won't even
be maybe the option for civil
settlements
because that may have been
preempted by other agreements
they
whoever worked on this and was virtuous
behind this 2009 thing
do i have that right i know dershowitz
was involved with
defending epstein at one point
but
this is kind of kind of brilliant
i i would say that whoever was behind
if if somebody was behind it
if this is a cover-up
is really really good
[Laughter]
because it looks like they're covering
it up right in front of us
totally getting away with it
does anybody think they won't get away
with it if
if what we're seeing
is exactly what it looks like
which is it looks like a massive cover
up
it looks like it's working right
what do you say
and the weird thing is that they're
doing it right in front of us
the i don't think there's anybody who
thinks
oh they're playing it transparently or
anything no they're covering it right in
front of us
and there's nothing you can do about it
and
it's the kind of issue where because it
doesn't affect most of us
except in the the general way that you
want you know criminals to go to jail
but because
i don't have any connection to any
anything in this story
i can watch the powers that be
apparently
covering up horrible
you know activity by famous people
and i just say huh
well that's suboptimal and then i go on
with my life the fact that almost nobody
else really really cares about the case
allows them to do this right in front of
us
and we're like ah suboptimal
i got other things to worry about
it's kind of
amazing usually these things at least
have a little bit of a
a little bit of a cover story that oh no
there's nothing like that going on
goodness no nobody's covering anything
up
here's what's really happening but this
doesn't even have a cover story does it
there's not even a cover story it's like
no we're just going to cover this up
pelosi is
probably going to step down as speaker
no matter what
and
the speculation has begun about who will
replace her
isn't this the same problem that the
democrats have about running a candidate
for president
which is they don't have any talent
it really you don't really notice
until they need a leader yeah no bench
you don't really notice until it was
like
well who the hell are they gonna run for
president
like like name a name like who would
even be
like a legitimate candidate and now they
speak of that same thing and you look at
the names that they're floating and i'm
thinking
do any of them look like they could do
what um
do what nancy pelosi did
they don't they don't really look like
they have the weight
that she had if you know what i mean the
gravitas or something
new some
maybe i think newsome is too polarizing
but i suppose you could say that about
everybody you've heard of
all right you saw the story about the
major interstate in eastern virginia so
snow closed the road while people are on
it so it snowed until people couldn't
move
and there were people who were stuck on
the road for
19 hours
they were in
their car
on the road
now obviously many of those cars ran out
of gas
um
so you know they were stuck and then
there was snow and then the cars out of
gas
and so even
senator tim kaine
was in that
and he he spent 19 hours
on the road
now you should read some of the threads
of people there's there's one by i think
a
news person who was stuck there
it it's really scary
now
somebody says where do you go to the
bathroom
i have to think there was a lot of
yellow snow by the end of two days
because it was sort of like an overnight
almost two days situated i don't even
think it's resolved yet
it's not resolved right there's still
some of them still there
but there had to be a lot of yellow snow
um some people didn't bring food some
did
people ran out of gas it was amazing
now i'd like to answer a question that
many of you have asked me
many times i've been asked the following
question
scott
how could you live in california with
all the problems there
well i'll tell you the number one reason
i live in california
that generally speaking
i do not risk death
by walking outdoors
that's it
that that's my reason
i have lots of other reasons right but
that's the reason i moved here
because i once uh had my car break down
i've told this story before in the
middle of the winter just about now is
you know i think it was february-ish
uh in my senior year of high of college
and i was miles from civilization in in
a snowstorm like this one but i was the
only car and my car broke
and there was no other cars
and i didn't bring a jacket
in the middle of the winter
because i was just going to be in my car
and i was in college
right
if you're you know if you're 19 what was
i 20 i guess if you're 20 years old
and you're just going from your car to a
building you don't really need that
jacket
until your car breaks down
25 miles from civilization
so when i read this story i am super
triggered by this i gotta tell you just
personally because if you haven't almost
died
from exposure
you don't quite understand how scary
this was
really really scary
do you carry a black a jacket or blanket
in my car yeah yes there is a spare
jacket in the back of my car
that is correct
and that's in california
but as soon as the weather turns you
know below 70 there's a spare jacket in
the back of my car
yes
and always probably will be
well
here's the topic that you're sick of
hearing about but i'm going to try to
give you some value so
those of you who are tired of hearing
about this
i'm not going to be offended if you want
to do something else but i'm going to
try to give you something you haven't
seen yet okay
you've all heard now about mass
formation psychosis and dr malone talked
about it he's not the creator of the
idea but he was popularizing it
and the idea is that we're we're all so
uncertain and confused and scared
that our minds are not working correctly
is that good enough for a summary
that we're all so uh isolated scared
and we don't know what's true because
the news is so confusing
that we're in a state of easily
easily being persuaded
but also simply not thinking correctly
like we've lost our ability to reason
does that seem like what we're in
do you feel that we're in that
now i've said to it we're always in it
so it's not really the pandemic
you know we've been in it since at least
the 50s
so that that's my contribution this is
not new but it's definitely here
i'm certainly not questioning whether it
exists
i'm just saying it's not new all right
however
i just tied two things together today
that finally made sense to me
i tweeted this morning that there are a
ton of people who are really mad at me
but their anger seems not to have a
reason which they are willing to offer
and so finally in frustration i tweeted
today
can somebody give me an idea
why so many people are angry with me
because i actually don't even know the
topic
is it
vaccinations
is it is that i said something about the
joe rogan interviews that were
sub-optimal you know even while saying
he's a national treasure
and so i asked the question smoking hot
wife jealousy somebody says
uh could be could be
and so i asked the question
and the answers were
all over the board
they were all over the board
now what have i taught you
is happening if you ask a question
and you let's say you ask a question
about something and everybody gives you
one of two or three standard answers
what what would you judge about that
situation
you would judge that maybe you have a
you have a different opinion
and that
you know it's two people with a
different opinion
um
but what would be your uh take
if you asked a hundred people what they
were angry about with you
and they all had different reasons
what would be the take
they're all angry with me so it's the
same person they're angry about
but their reasons
are all different
and it all happened about the same time
how do you explain that
here's how i explain it
when you see that it's almost a
guarantee of of
some kind of a
mental phenomena right
if people had largely the same
complaints about me i'd say oh that's
something to look at maybe it's me
or maybe it's them
but if people's
if people are mad
and the thing that cued me off is that
all of their their
criticisms were generic
so the criticisms all fell into certain
categories
very reliably
so they would say you're coping i don't
know what that meant
like what was i wrong about
they'd say
accept the l
and i would say i didn't even know i was
competing
what is even the topic i'm accepting the
el on
then there were you know another there
so all these generic things
so
have you put together the two things i'm
about to put together for you yet who's
ahead of me
who's ahead of me
it's a mass formation psychosis
the mass formation psychosis
that i've been talking about and dr
malone talked about is all in the news
is the reason
that people are mad at me
because if they were mad at me for a
specific let's say a prediction
or a specific
anything
they would just say so
but it's the mass
it is the mass formation psychosis
that is exactly the reason people are
mad but they don't know why
they don't really know why i saw some
people offer reasons
that might be explanations one was
the the best one i saw is that the
for a lot of the people on the right
which would include a lot of my audience
um
that joe rogan is a quote lifeboat
for their opinion and i put a hole in
the lifeboat
that's actually not bad
good because there's something
irrational happening
could be that
could be that i simply disagree with
people's opinions or they think so
because here's the weirdest part
almost everybody who's mad at me doesn't
disagree with me
now if you don't think that's true
i could pick anybody who is by critic
and just walk through what is it you
think that i think that's different from
you and you wouldn't find anything we
disagree on
and yet people are still hopping mad
hop and mad that is the the mass
formation psychosis
because because if people had a good
solid reason
they would just tell me
and there would be a
similarity to it
now the best the best theory i got
that had any meat to it
was that people believe i once had a
different opinion in which i trusted
vaccinations
and trusted the companies involved
but that as time has gone by
people say
that i've changed my opinion
because i realized how wrong i was
did anybody see let anything like that
happen
for those of you who watched me have you
seen me change my opinion on
vaccinations from the start
now the people on locals watch me the
most there is a subscription service
and
almost all of them are saying no
but i did see a yes
so even even on locals somebody's saying
yes but overwhelmingly the people who
watched me the most
say my opinion has never changed but
here's where it gets really weird
all right here's your first tip
for uh understanding when you're
hallucinating and when you have a clear
view of the world are you ready for this
here's your first
clip or your first tip
let's take the uh the specific
accusation one of the few that i got
that multiple people had
is that i trusted
the big pharma companies too much
so that that's that's what people are
saying about me
that i trusted the big pharma companies
too much
now here's how you can tell if that's a
hallucination
and you could use this technique for
other people in different situations
just for a moment
just for a moment try to take yourself
out of the fight
and just like look at it like you're
looking down from space
right you're not in it has nothing to do
with it you're simply looking down from
space
at this accusation
and the accusation is this
that the guy who is the creator of the
dilbert comic strip
whose 30-year run
is almost entirely
based on not trusting management
and about money distorting things
my entire career
is based on that principle you can't
trust management you can't trust what
anybody says the data is all made up
right
anybody who follows my comic would be
aware of that that i am the single most
vocal skeptic
of large companies in
the whole world
the whole world
you you could search the entire world
and you would not find anybody
anybody
who has spent more time
saying you shouldn't trust
what people in power tell you
now
do you think that that guy again
remember you're going to pull yourself
out you can look at it like your your
has nothing to do with you
nothing to do with you
you have you come to believe
that the person who is most identified
with not trusting big companies
and indeed said it directly a thousand
times
since the beginning of the pandemic
publicly at least a thousand times
you think that that guy
has a problem in which he trusted
big pharma literally one of the least
trustable entities
of all time
just ask yourself
does it sound reasonable
if you were to take yourself out of it
and just say all right here's here's the
thing that the person who is most
associated with distrusting big
companies
is actually
one of the most trusting of big
companies do you think that actually
happened
this is this is the technique
right to ask yourself is that really did
that happen
if you can say to yourself yeah that
sounds actually pretty reasonable
well then go with it
but i'll tell you what it sounds like to
me and of course i'm i'm in the middle
of this i'm biased it sounds to me like
somebody's saying
you know
i don't think mcdonald's sells
hamburgers
that's what it sounds like to me when
you say the guy who created dilbert is
too trusting of big organizations it
sounds exactly like
i don't think mcdonald's sells
hamburgers i don't think they do
me comic is 100 behind you
good to know i love me comic
it's a good comic
um
so um
i decided i would do a self-audit
because uh wouldn't you agree at this
point that it's also still possible
that i'm experiencing cognitive
dissonance and everybody else in the
world is right
right
so i thought i'd do a self-audit so i
started compiling
my predictions about the pandemic
and so i started making my list if you
would like to participate in that
please remind me or message me
on anything you think i got wrong
ask me a specific prediction
anything you think i got wrong
or anything you think i predicted right
just in case
i don't have a full accounting
uh scott could this be someone trying to
damage you well it doesn't really look
organized
it just it looks like uh it looks like a
bunch of people
who have lost their minds
from the
mass formation psychosis
so but i do think it's fair when
hundreds of people tell you that you're
losing it
that you should take that seriously
don't you think
you know
at the same time i can defend myself and
say oh this looks like obviously a
delusional thing
at the same time
don't you think there's a responsibility
on my part to take it seriously
if so many people are saying it right
so i'm gonna do an audit of my own uh i
guess sanity if you will
and so help me out
tell me what things i predicted wrong
uh or even right and we'll see how i did
just on the pandemic you don't have to
go beyond that
now other things that people criticized
me for was a tweet made before biden was
elected i said if joe biden
got elected there's a good chance you'll
be dead in a year
now how many of you think
that a tweet that says
if joe biden gets elected there's a good
chance you'll be dead in a year
how many took that as
literally uh the holocaust will
will be kicked off in less than a year
and
how many took it that way
because if you did you're not you're not
really a good reader
here's how you should have taken it but
i will accept that it could have been
clearer
right
you should have taken it this way things
will get a lot more dangerous and
especially for republicans
does that seem fair
that the way you should have interpreted
you know because twitter is all about
hyperbole so yeah you should be mentally
reducing the hyperbole before you
interpret it
if it's your first day on twitter you're
you're excused but if you spend any time
there
you know that the absolutes are never
meant to be absolutes right
if you say everybody does x nobody
thinks you really mean everybody
not everybody everybody just lots of
people it's just the way we talk
so um i predicted that if biden got
elected there's a good chance she'd be
dead
in a year
crime has spiked
the number of people dead from corona
virus way more than trump
um we probably have a little more risk
with our nuclear adversaries than under
trump although you could argue that one
overdoses through the roof
um
am i leaving anything out
suicides through the roof
overdoses suicides
coronavirus
crime
and then you throw on top of that the
political prisoners
the january 6 political prisoners and i
think we just have to call them
political prisoners at this point i i
don't feel
i don't feel that we we should assume
that they're just part of the justice
system
it doesn't look like that to me and i
think that the government has the burden
of proof
that they are not screwing us
so if you say to me scott can you prove
that they're political prisoners
i would say nope
nope
nor do i need to
because if you're making it look exactly
like their political prisoners that is
the assumption that the citizens should
operate on
it's up to the government to tell us
that's not what's happening and they
haven't
right so the government is guilty until
presumed innocent so january 6 those are
political prisoners
until
the government makes an argument that
they're not
okay
so that's the operating assumption
uh
let's uh test another theory for here's
another way to sort out
uh truth from hallucination
you all know robert o'neill
does everybody know robert o'neill
rob i think he goes by
um he was a little bit famous for uh
putting a bullet into osama bin laden
i think more than one actually i think
he had some fun with it
but uh he tweeted today
that twitter had deleted joe rogan's
interviews with dr robert malone and dr
peter mccullough
and rob asks us why do you think that is
why do you think that is
what would be your answer to uh rob's
question which is a very good question
why do you think those two doctors
got deleted
now what are the possibilities
now one possibility
is political right yeah one possibility
is
uh money
that big pharma
pushed the right levers and made it
happen right
so let's let's consider our
possibilities
so uh one
there is a uh
a very impressive conspiracy
in which the pharma companies
can actually have the stuff taken off of
social media maybe because they're big
advertisers
something like that now does that seem
reasonable
does it seem like a reasonable
possibility
that big pharma is getting their critics
kicked off of social media yeah
yeah that could happen
it's certainly within the realm of
possible right
possible
okay let's talk about some other
possibilities
um is it possible that the reason they
were those two doctors were kicked off
is that they can't even convince
other doctors that they're right
because i don't think twitter used its
doctor judgment
do you
do you think there's a
doctor who works at twitter who said
yeah i'm a doctor too
i looked at this stuff and i've judged
that
as my doctor experience tells me this is
not right
do you think that happened or do you
think twitter
got advice
from experts
what do you think
um i think
that you have to ask this question so
rob o'neal's question is a good one
now we don't know exactly the answer
right why did these two doctors
get kicked off
that's a good question
right
but the question that also is a good
question is
why is it that these two doctors
can't convince other doctors that are
right
but they've done a good job of
convincing
non-doctors they're right
would you be concerned
about doctors who could convince people
who don't know anything
but could not convince people who know
as much as they know
does that worry you
because if they could convince other
doctors
then twitter wouldn't have kicked them
off would they
do you think if there was a
a solid even a minority but a solid body
of other doctors saying yeah you know
i've looked at their argument and i
gotta say that's pretty strong
now you might say to be scott scott
scott
twitter doesn't even check with other
doctors i don't know
but you don't know either right i don't
know that they do
but you don't know that they don't
it seems kind of obvious that they would
especially if somebody asks how why'd
you do that
now of course they don't have full
transparency so i guess they they could
do anything they want
so that's my
here's my next
uh
advice for sorting out bs from reality
now keep in mind that none of the tips i
give you for sorting reality from
hallucination will be 100
you got that right these are all sort of
rule of thumb
way so just as you say you follow the
money
it predicts almost every time doesn't it
but it could also be wrong
so would you agree that the that the
rule follow the money is a really good
rule of thumb for figuring out what's
real but you know not every time
you give me that
so i'm going to give you some more like
that
so that are in the category of follow
the money doesn't work every time
but it works a
lot and it is if the expert can't
convince other experts
and they're and they're skipping the
other experts because they can't
convince them
and they're going directly to the public
there's a reason for that
there's a reason for that
i'm seeing a counterpoint here
let's see
i saw a counterpoint about dr malone
having people on his side
where is that
no i miss it
i think there's some counter argument
that dr malone has
people on his side but you would have to
limit that to the specific question
wouldn't you
so the question is not not dr malone
good or bad
that's not the question the question is
specific claims
that are not in the mainstream
so if if the doctors have convinced
people that their specific claims
are true
and there are lots of them
we should be talking about that right we
shouldn't be talking about
there's this one doctor who says
something
we should say there's a whole bunch of
doctors
and we'll put some more on and they'll
say the same thing
but why do these two doctors get all the
invitations there no other doctors who
agree with with them
yes you don't even know the claims
disputed that's correct i don't know all
of them
i do know that there is one specific
case of dr malone
uh
tweeting information that was considered
false information
about
the outcomes of the vaccine
so i think that's what he got kicked off
for my understanding is he got kicked
off
for
tweeting data
that was misinterpreted or obviously
wrong
now
it's the obvious part
that is where we're going to disagree
i would having looked at the debunkers
and then looked at the the data that dr
malone tweeted
uh the debunkers looked stronger
to me
but could be wrong
could be wrong
all right so ask yourself why you would
ever agree with doctors who can't
convince other doctors to agree with
them i would never do that by the way
um so arthur is saying good point arthur
says scott's got
not working for me because other doctors
are afraid of being canceled
let me call complete and total
the other doctors are afraid of being
canceled
absolute complete and i'm
surprised that you believe that
let me tell you
let me tell you what the real world
looks like
in the real world
the
people are too different
for every person you find
who doesn't want to get canceled and
there'll be lots of them
you're going to find at least one person
who likes the attention
you will
you will find at least one person who
likes the attention now the doctors you
can trust
cannot trust are the ones who need
hospital privileges do we all agree on
that if you require hospital privileges
you can't go against you know the
mainstream hospital opinion
you'll get kicked down
but
that still leaves a lot of people
right retired people retired doctors
what about the other people who worked
on the same team with dr malone have you
seen all the interviews of the people
who have the same experience
as dr malone about mrna technology
worked with them on the project
same experience have you seen the
interviews with them
why not
do you think they're all afraid
all of them
so this is very similar to the um
you're going to hate this but i'm going
to do it anyway do you remember the
fine people
thing in charlottesville and when you go
to debunk it
people will always go down the what i
call the the well
until the last thing they have left
is that
in a big event like that
nobody could have unknowingly been there
without knowing it was a
a nazi neo-nazi event
that's like somebody who's never been
born in america or never been here
any large group of americans have every
opinion
again i'm speaking weird absolutes but
if you take a hundred americans just
randomly and put them in a room what do
you think they're gonna have two
opinions
no they have like 100 opinions
so if you're telling me that doctors are
so
are so single-minded
that their fear of their career
is is the the guiding principle that
just got all of them
basically the entire industry
was so high minded
that they had to do what their medical
masters told them to do
we don't live in any world like that
at all
in our world people disagree with
everything
vigorously all the time if they believe
it
if they believe it
have you met any private doctors
who
agree with him but just don't want to
say it there must be some of those right
but we don't live in a world where
anybody can shut down an entire
profession
i don't think that can happen you
just google it scott google what
you've got to be a little more specific
than
just google it
now
if you say there are in fact many
doctors who publicly agree with
dr malone i'd like to see them on
interviews
get a few more of them you know it'd be
great get like three of those doctors
bring them in and say
here's some claims made what do you
think
i'd like i'd watch that
all right
but i i believe it is uh
not really
a
good understanding of the world if you
believe an entire profession
can be hive minded that easily
pick any
pick any category of
debate in this country
do we have any category of debate on any
topic from climate change to whatever
do we have any topic
that you can get this many people on one
side
not really
you can't get that many people on one
side over anything
and and people will take wild risks that
you wouldn't take
would any of you take the risks that i
take with your careers
i guess i'm a good test case
you've seen how many risks i take with
my career would you do that
well
somebody says you're rich but i did it
before i was rich
i did get fired from my day job before
my
before my uh
dilbert job took off because i took a
big risk
yeah no but even before i had the fu
money you're right about that
um
oh here we go nathan says now
i haven't read nathan's whole comment
but i'm going to make a prediction
that there's something not specific here
here we go
nathan says people are mad at you
meaning me because you say things that
are not true okay can you give me an
example there won't be one and give
yourself outs
okay that's generic
so so far this would be a sign of
cognitive dissonance because it's that
new generic thing but let's see if he
goes further he says malone is head of
organization consisting of sixteen
thousand doctors that agree with him on
covet issues it's called the unity
project
that is a claim
which could easily be checked
so let's take let's say the specific
data
that dr malone got kicked off of twitter
would anybody like to take a bet
that his 16 000
people in his unity project
disagree with the
the data
how many of you think that the his 16
000 people who agree with him in general
also agree that the data he
he promoted on twitter was accurate
would anybody want to take a bat with me
i'll bet that the majority of the people
that you say agree with him would say
that the specific data that he got
kicked off of twitter for
was not reliable
or it had been misinterpreted
anybody want to take the bet
you don't have to agree with every
single subject yes but the only things
we're talking about with malone
or what he got kicked off of social
media for
and i i i'm going to make a prediction
that the people who are on his side
don't agree with him on the stuff he got
kicked off of twitter for
anybody want to take the bet
you'd only need to find one person
just find one other person who thinks
that data was accurate
i don't think you can so the problem
with malone is
and somebody also said that uh
they said i was not giving dr malone the
credit he deserves
for his qualifications in other words i
was under
selling his credentials
i did the opposite of that
i basically drooled all over his
credentials as some of the most
impressive credentials i've ever seen
that's unambiguous
nobody
nobody is questioning his credentials
that's the one place we're all starting
with
okay we all agree has lots of
credentials
now let's talk
so so you can see that the the
complaints about me are just actually
crazy
yeah
all right
but here's what happens when you
separate the uh the expert from the
criticisms so dr malone went on joe
rogan
sam harris uh tweeted a
let's say a
criticism of dr malone by z-dog anybody
watching z-dog you can see him on locals
and and elsewhere
and z-dog was also
md
criticized dr malone on a number of
specific points and went through them
so now now you know something right so
now if you've seen
if you've seen
dr malone's full interview
and then you looked at z-dog's criticism
of him
which didn't happen at the same time
right they happened in different places
and times
you would have a pretty good idea
because now you've got the pros you've
got the cons right
how many would agree with that
because now you've seen both sides and z
dog remember z dog is a very good
communicator
and a doctor
so he knows what he's talking about
well
that didn't work out at all
because
after z dog did his criticisms
twitter user paul collider i mentioned
him often
went in and criticized the criticisms
and here's the criticisms of the
criticisms
is that in each case i don't know if it
was every case but in the the ones noted
z-dog had misinterpreted
dr malone
and had criticized a misinterpretation
so in other words
if i hadn't seen paul collider's
criticism of the criticisms
i i would have been much more persuaded
that z dog was saying something that it
was an actual
debunk
now
is paul collider correct
that z dog
misinterpreted malone
i don't know
you would need a you would need yet
another fact-checker to fact-check paul
collider who fact-checked
z-dog who fact-checked
malone
none of this is useful information
it turns out that as soon as you uh
as soon as you separate the claim
from the criticism
everything goes to
so my problem with the the joe rogan one
one
one interview
is that it removes the criticism and
once it's removed then you're not really
sure if you're even talking about the
same thing anymore and then you get into
word thinking and who said what and it's
just useless
yeah fact checking is dumb because you
usually don't have a you don't have a
reply to the fact check right that's the
problem with fact checking so fact
checking is a bad model better than
nothing but it's a bad model because it
separates in time and space
the claim from the debunk they have to
happen at the same time
otherwise you don't know anything right
you need somebody to say oh no no you're
misinterpreting me
i can't defend that because i never said
it so get back on my point
and now what's your criticism
so that that's why it needs to happen at
the same time you need the person who
makes the claim
to continuously pull the person back
into the actual claim
because if you know anything
when people criticize they make up their
own hallucination of what you claimed
and then they're off on that you've got
to have the claimer say nope
stop
never said that
now let's talk about what i did say
right
that could work
all right so um and then i also uh
tweeted one other critique
of dr malone and um
smart people said but scott that that
fact check
is like generic and off the point and it
looks like they're it looks like the
fact check the way it's written is
weasel words
like with no credibility whatsoever
and that was actually a reasonable
criticism
now keep in mind i didn't tell you the
the fact check was right
i told you you need to see it
you need to see the claim you need to
see the fact check but i will say that
the doctors who did not agree with dr
malone
um they did seem to be weaseling about
maybe related topics like they like they
weren't answering as directly as you
think they want that you wanted them to
but here was my interpretation
one interpretation is you can't trust
the fact checkers
and that's a fair interpretation
the other interpretation is that the
doctors
were aware of all of malone's claims
and
um if they thought he was saying
something that was true
i think they would have addressed it
or
were false in other words the fact that
the
the doctors weren't seeing
what um
malone saw
does tell you something even if they
didn't address it because it's hard to
be specific about
that stuff
um
all right
weird comments going on today
all right here's your next uh trick for
determining who is hallucinating and who
is not you've heard it before but every
time i apply it to a specific situation
it helps more examples you see the
better
generally speaking
generally speaking
right i will allow that there will be
exceptions
um
uh addison says do you suppose people
are tired of you attacking experts would
do it without doing the work to
understand the issues
yes i believe that that that people
believe i'm doing that but i don't think
it's happening
in other words i've asked for a specific
claim
and then i say
what have i said about that claim and i
don't have any examples
so it's
what you're saying would would be right
if we were talking about something
specific but nobody can even tell me why
they're mad
like what do they disagree with i don't
think it's only because i've uh
because i don't think i've dismissed any
experts i've said give me a specific
claim
and we'll look at it
i don't i don't think that that's
unreasonable all right here's your your
tip
general tip but i'm going to apply it to
this one
if you have four people in a room one of
them says
there's an elephant standing right in
front of us
the other three
who are just as smart
just as capable as spotting elephants
are looking in the same room as a little
room and they say
wait what
i don't see an elephant
there is an elephant right there
right there i'm looking at it look at it
and the other three people are like
um we don't see the elephant
who's right
it's a generic situation we're not
talking about the pandemic it's a
generic situation
one person sees an elephant
three do not they're all equally trained
in spotting elephants and it's it's a
little room
it's not i'm not talking about a forest
or a jungle
it's like a little room and you're in
there with it
who's right
somebody says all of them
you get extra credit for saying all of
them i know what you're going out there
yeah
i always bet on the three and here's why
hallucinations are additions to scenes
usually
there could be exceptions
but a hallucination
is something added to the scene
you don't have hallucinations of
somebody sitting in a room with an
elephant
who doesn't see it
right that hallucination just doesn't
happen the hallucination that does
happen
is
is somebody adding something to a scene
first of all
will you accept that as a good
generalization
if somebody sees a conspiracy theory
let's say a false one and the other
people can't see it
who's probably right
assuming that they can see all the same
information right there's no difference
in information who's probably right
the ones who can't see it right because
hallucinations are positive additions
dr malone
may be seeing things
that people with the same amount of
experience and vision
are not seeing
if the other people saw it too
i would say well they're all experts
you tell me four experts are in the room
they all saw the elephant there's an
elephant in that room
but if four experts walk out of the same
room with the same expertise the same
experience and three of them say there
is no elephant in that room and one of
them says i see it clear as day
who do you bet on
the three who don't see it
or the one who does
now keep in mind
the one who does is showing his work
so there's no like extra knowledge or
anything like that he's showing his work
it's completely transparent
and three of them don't see it
but one of them does
somebody says you'd believe the one i do
think that many of you would believe the
one
however
the reason that you might believe the
one is that you have been fooled
and primed
by the following model of reality
the people who are the rogue and
disagree with the the mainstream
sometimes they're right and then they
become heroes
i'm an example
for example when i predicted that trump
would win in 2016 i was a weird rogue
outlier
when i was right
that he won in 2016 i got a lot of
attention
did that make you think that the rogue
outlier is right more than wrong
it shouldn't
because the reason the reason i got a
lot of attention
is that the odds of the rogue
person being right are really low
that's the entire reason that i did it
because i knew that if i got it right
you know it would boost my credibility
now i did i was pretty sure he would win
for reasons
but
but i i have experience with this
the rogue person is almost always wrong
almost always
and you have the opposite impression
because when they are right it's all we
talk about
right the reason you know sully did such
a good job of landing that plane in the
hudson river
is because
it was rare
right that's why you heard of it
so your mind your mind imagines that
rogues are often right
the reality is the wrong 95 percent of
the time
if you just looked at your whole life
and all of the rogues who made a claim
five percent of the time not only are
they right but it changes history
and then you can't get that in your head
my god that rogue was right and changed
history there was wright brothers
there was rogue
bicycle making wright brothers
they made a plane that nobody said could
happen the rogue
the rogue is always right now the rogue
is almost always wrong
so bet against it should you have bet
against me
in 2016
what was the smart play
was the smart play to bet on me
or was a smart play to bet on all the
experts in the world
the smart play was to bet on all the
experts in the world
all right now i i had a very specific
angle into it if you followed that maybe
maybe that would be different but in
general
don't bet on the rogue
it's a bad bet
all right
so that's your other trick so here are
your tricks
for
not being an expert yourself
but but but deducing
the quality of the experts
uh first follow the money of course but
i don't see any specific
monetary incentive going on here do you
now you could argue i don't know some
doctors are raising their profile or
something but i don't know i don't
really see the monetary
incentive of the rogues of the rogue
doctors
so i would discount that one in this
case
um but i would definitely say why can't
they convince people who were
um
on their side
now you say that they have
and i say there isn't the slightest
chance
that the people who are even agreeing
with them on the general stuff
also think that the data that they got
kicked off for twitter for
was real
now i could be convinced you just have
to show me some other doctors who say
this data looks real
and dr malone got kicked off for it that
could you could do that i mean you could
convince me
but
um right now if they can't convince
other doctors and i don't see evidence
of it um well i could that could change
and
um i'm not also not aware of anything
that i'm especially disagreeing with the
doctor about except the things he
tweeted about data
i'm not through the entire the entire
interview
but i've gotten through a lot of the
good stuff
i will finish it off see my problem is
that
uh
you see the problem right
i guess i don't have to say it again
um and i would i would argue that i have
never disagreed with dr malone on his
expertise
would you accept that
um
i'm seeing these names steve kirsch
brett weinstein steve kirsch brett
weinstein why why are you saying that
why are holden
holden lou keeps repeating these two
names
and why are you doing that
um here is a here's
mass formation here so here's a yo-yo
gamer is just says in all caps scott
equals boomer equal disconnected
there's a good comment there
all right holden um i'm going to
ban you
for just repeating the same thing over
and over again
you are now hidden i thought you had
something to say but apparently you
didn't
um
whoops i'm looking at some
i watched it all
why do you compare yourself to great men
what
that's a weird comment
oh so here's my take on malone i don't
believe i've ever challenged him on his
uh expertise
has anybody seen me do that
has anybody seen me challenge dr malone
on his expertise i don't think i have
why would i that'd be dumb
i've only challenged him on my expertise
so i believe that i might be better at
him at determining what data looks real
from a study based on the fact that he
tweeted some stuff that looks pretty
sketchy
and
i think i'm good at determining who is
hallucinating and who's not
that's my expertise
i think i'm good at determining bs
that's another part of my expertise
so
i have on one side we have some let's
say rules of thumb for determining who's
hallucinating and he falls into
pretty much all of them
which doesn't mean doesn't mean
i'm right and he's wrong
uh one particular did he state this in
question the the one i remember was data
that showed that the vaccines were more
dangerous for
young people than we thought
so give me a fact check on this but i
believe that's one of them
but if you looked at the data he just
misread it
now is that the one um
is that the one where he claimed a lot
of myocarditis but the only people they
studied were people who had it
whatever it was was like a real basic
error
so that's one of them i know about
um
all right
how many of you think that there some
part of the government is trying to
train you through the pandemic
into
being easier to control
how many think that was an explicit
an explicit
goal of somebody
i'm seeing some yeses
a lot of yeses
who do you think was doing that
do you think there was a meeting or
meetings in which people said you know
if we can get people to do a bunch of
little stuff like wearing masks
it will be easier to get them to do more
stuff do you think there was anybody
who ever had that
conversation
i'm going to say no
i'm going to say no
because i think what it is is just a
collection of a whole bunch of people
doing what they think is right or good
for them
i think it's just a whole bunch of
self-interest
averaged together i don't think there's
any big puppet master who's
manipulating us into making us more
subservient
to me that looks sounds a little crazy
actually
because it would imagine that there's
some person or person who has that kind
of power
and that kind of like long-term plan
i mean if you have a name
of a person or persons that consider it
but
there's no evidence of anything like
that
somebody says not sure but it's the end
result is it
is it because that's not what i see what
i see is the public getting increasingly
less likely
to do what they're told
am i wrong
to to me the the entire united states is
on the verge of revolution
if you think that this caused the
citizens of the united states to be more
compliant
i would say we're very compliant in the
short run
because you know it's an emergency
nobody knows what to do it's like oh
tell me what to do i'll do it in the
short run americans and everybody else
can be very compliant
but we are a very non-compliant country
in fact you could argue that the entire
history of the united states is about
non-compliance
we're the most non-complying people ever
you know do you think somebody's gonna
well probably somebody who's gonna wear
masks even after they're not required
because they did before
but i'm pretty sure we're all just dying
to get out of these
little
limitations
um
all right
and then
how many of you think that my big
problem is my attitude
or the the way that i communicate
how many how many would say that's
that's my big problem
that's the way i communicate
no no really oh that's interesting i
thought i thought that was going to be
all yeses
and i'm getting more no's and yes's
i'm surprised
because a lot of people are saying that
um the problem is my arrogance
and
um i'm sensitive to that criticism
because
um
it's not the first time i've heard it
so you have to take it seriously if you
hear it more than once
but i'll tell you what it feels like on
the inside
on the inside i think i've been telling
you
that nobody knows what to do
like i told you that i guessed about
vaccinations and nobody's good at
predicting our leaders probably aren't
even going to make a difference
so to me i've said the opposite of i
have the answer and you don't to me i
said it's unknowable we're all guessing
good luck
to me that sounds the opposite of
arrogant
but does it sound arrogant to you
yeah i think it is here's what i think i
think when i demolish people's arguments
because most people are not good well
let me give you a set up here
would you agree that uh debating and
reasoning are learned skills
it takes some natural ability but do you
agree with the notion that reasoning and
debate are learned skills mostly
you know on top of whatever your
intelligence is
would you agree
that somebody who practices it a lot
is going to be better than somebody who
doesn't practice
is that fair
i think it is because that would be just
like everything else right everything
you practice
now
can you think of anybody who's practiced
more than me
in fact one of my biggest criticisms is
i can't stop practicing
because i'm on twitter all the time
responding to arguments and criticisms i
don't think anybody's practiced more
than me and not just on twitter for my
entire life
i wrote a book on how to think clearly
so here's my
my take i think that people who don't um
have the same amount of practice
when they're when they encounter
somebody who does
it's very triggering
because our opinions would be different
but i would argue that my opinions are
sort of
carved out of a lifetime of practice
but if your opinion was just something
that you you know ginned up on the spot
but you're not really somebody who works
on
you know the technique of debate and
rational thought
that it would be very off-putting
it would be very off-putting
to see somebody who's experienced at
this tell you that you're wrong
so i think some of it is that reaction
there's a big difference between
practice and talent yes but for the same
amount of talent practice will be the
difference
all right people don't know the
difference between facts and opinions
weirdly weirdly they act like they don't
i mean they do know the difference
between facts and opinion
but we all consistently act like we
don't
and i think i fall into that too
knowing what you're talking about helps
you
uh
all right interesting
all right i think
those questions can you comment on aoc's
sexual frustrations
well i think you mean the comments she
made the republicans are uh
mad at aoc because they can't date her
so she actually tweeted something like
that
republicans really secretly are
frustrated because they can't date her
and i thought that was just provocative
tweeting which she's good at
i wouldn't take any of that too
seriously
what if the hallucination is you thought
you heard elephant but it was really
chair
well
what do you think will be my response
when you challenge the analogy
if there's one thing i could do
like for my career
like the the one accomplishment would be
i love if people stop challenging my
analogies like that's going to help
um
uh see oh okay addison has a 20 dollar
comment here i love you
but bo i don't love how you seem to so
often disregard individual beliefs
as unimportant well i've never done that
or delusion
uh never done that
just some things are delusions and some
are not
and a good example is your view of trans
athletes and women's sports no that's a
terrible example
that's the worst example you could ever
cough with my view of trans athletes in
sports is that sports are broken
it doesn't even have anything to do with
trans i just use the trans topic
to make my point that sports themselves
are
poorly organized
for modern life
they're great i love sports just played
every sport you can think of
i love love sports but in in the current
mode there they have a lot of problems
uh
so i use the trans thing only to
attack the inadequacy of sports
what i mean by that is people should be
playing with people who are similar
ability
you all agree right
people should play with the people of
similar ability
100 of people agree that that would be a
good situation that's all that's my
entire opinion
my entire opinion is people should play
with the people or someone doesn't
matter gender or whatever
so if you're telling me that the issue
with trans is that they they're on a
team in which they're demolishing women
i say right right that's that's my
problem
why would you form a team
where one person is
for whatever reason
you know
let's say uh when lou el cinder that was
his name before uh kareem abdul-jabbar
when he was in high school
do you think they put i'm just guessing
but do you think they put 14-year-old
kareem abdul-jabbar
on the jv team
or do you think he got bumped up to play
with the older people because it would
be ridiculous
to have somebody seven foot four or
whatever he was
playing with uh you know 14 year olds
right
so we routinely
balance things and say oh okay this is a
special case you know yao ming you're
not with the regular people you go play
with the tall people
all i'm saying is we should just do more
of that because it works
we should never even be having a
conversation about gender now some of
you say but wait scott that would be
unfair to women
because they wouldn't get sports
scholarships
exactly
exactly
not because there's something wrong with
women
it's because the sports are broken why
the hell are we giving anybody a sports
scholarship to college
how about don't do that
whether you're male or female how about
no men get them
either would that make more sense do you
i went to a college in which i could
tell this some of the resources that
would have gone to my education had been
funneled into the basketball team
how's that good for me i'm not on the
basketball team
so while i think the sports are great
and entertaining and good for people etc
the sports themselves just need to be
fixed
you need to get the other thing you need
to do is get the traveling teams just
get out of that
like if there are parents who are
dedicating their life
to
a son or daughter's
softball career
that isn't even going to get them into
college
bad idea
stop doing it
just have friendly games among people
who are similarly talented and call it
today the best possible sport you could
ever have playing with people of similar
talent it's amazing
all the other stuff get rid of it
all right so did that help you i know a
lot of you had a problem with my trans
opinions but the truth is i don't have
an opinion about trans
i really don't i have an opinion about
sports
you you just thought it was an opinion
about trans
uh
somebody asked
if you're wearing the one extra coat
that i keep in the car what will my hot
wife wear and the answer is my hot wife
will have a coat
and i will freeze to death
because i often bring an extra jacket to
dinner
because females uh
for whatever reason don't often dress
warm enough if if it doesn't look good
so i will bring my one extra coat and
then i'll freeze to death over dinner
because i have to give up my coat as
soon as i sit down
so i started to uh
uh
oh nick says you could be communicated
poorly you mean the trans topic
you are correct
but
intentionally
in that case i communicated it poorly
because i was sort of enjoying all the
pushback on the trans stuff
uh with people not quite getting that i
was never even
even on that topic
i'm very pro-trans by the way
very very pro-trans
under the assumption that
why can't anybody do what they want
why am i telling people what to do
it has nothing to do with
them or their choices i just don't want
to be in the position of telling people
how to think and act
all right arguing
arguing and reasoning is adam dopamine
here saying
arguing and reasoning is like sex
everyone assumes they're good at it
because they like doing it
yeah bingo
bingo
um
i have a woo
all right um i apologize in advance
or not in advance i apologize
for making this too much about me
i hoped i hoped i could deliver
which was uh the topic is me but i'm
trying to teach you these rules you know
elephant in the room
if you can't talk the other experts in
it don't talk to the lay people
don't have uh
one person talking to an expert you need
you need a proximity so those are the
concepts
um but i don't care
uh you know my role my role in all this
is trivial that but the interesting part
is how people think
um
scott you said the three doctors were
not credible because they were not id'd
i corrected that uh as i said it because
somebody said they were id'd
right so you said they were not credible
because they're not id'd but in fact
they were id'd but they're um
the way the story was written
it was a little misleading to me
um
your biggest prediction
was that someone would withhold vital
information until after the election
30 days after election pfizer announced
the vaccine did i make that prediction
does anybody remember that prediction
that
did i ever say that
somebody would withhold vital
information until after the election
because that doesn't feel like something
i would say because it's so obvious
i
oh i did so somebody says i did say that
yeah i i'm i'm i thought i would not
have predicted that because that would
just be a statement of the obvious
right
was barely a prediction because i think
everybody said that
did i watch don't look up no i didn't
uh
here here's a comment clot that's my new
nickname clot your problem is people
know you're smart enough to make
everything you say manipulative toward
their persuasion ends that's true yeah
one of my big problems is that
if you think people could fool you
you're extra cautious
and
dr johnson might
my mascot is back you all know dr
johnson my mascot i used to call my
trolls trolls but once they become
prominent they become mascots
because like
at a certain level the troll just
becomes part of the entertainment so dr
johnson you are promoted to mascot yes
why were you so afraid of covet
how does anybody determine
who was afraid of what
how would you know that about me
well i examined my own mind to see if
you know anybody else's impression of
what i'm thinking is even close
how often do you think it's close
not often
um
let me tell you where my fears were uh
i'll try to be as honest i think i could
be honest completely honest about this
so i told you that when the pandemic
first started and i was shouting to
close the borders
there were smart people telling me this
civilization was about to end
actual civilization and the argument
wasn't that everybody would get infected
but that the the psychological part of
it on top of the actual infection would
just
close everything down and then
civilization would crumble there'd be
sort of a
cyclic um it would build on itself
basically
now
that
was a very real risk
and his scare duff
anime
all right
now you'd have to know and i'm not going
to tell you but you'd have to know what
source i was relying on to know about
that risk
let me just tell you it was a good one
it was a good one
let me tell you how good the source was
now
you won't be able to guess
um this is how good my source was that
told me that civilization might be on
the brink of ending it was the same
source that told me
the leak probably came from the wuhan
lab
before you ever knew there was a lab
there
before you had ever heard there was a
lab in wuhan
i knew privately
that it was the source of the leak
same source
told me civilization could be about
ready to end meaning that there would be
military on the streets basically
and
that scared the out of me
i'm not going to lie
i don't think i've ever been that afraid
for civilization
and you know for myself of course in the
family
um
so that part
yes i was afraid of but the actual risk
of getting the virus
i think i was in the normal range
whatever a normal range is
i i definitely
took steps to avoid it
but as i famously tweeted by the time
i'd gotten vaccinated myself
at the time i got vaccinated
any concerns i had sort of dropped to
zero
now they weren't zero you know everybody
has risk but once the risk gets down
into the background noise level like the
same risk of getting into your car
same risk of a heart attack right once
that risk was down with rest i i didn't
really worry about it a lot
so i would say that i was very worried
about civilization
i was a normal amount of concerned about
getting infected with something that
could kill me a sort of on the on the
border of whether i have a comorbidity
or not
age-wise
and so
i can't say that there was ever a time i
made a fear-based decision
well except that
uh i made the decision to not let
civilization end
so i wanted to see what i could do about
not keeping you know not ending
civilization
so i will never know if i made any
difference
but i probably was the most prominent
voice saying everything would be okay
and i do know who listens to me
and who doesn't
um
somebody says arrogant
well let me test that
is it arrogant to say
is it arrogant to say that
i was one of the most prominent voices
to say things would be fine
true or not true
i don't know who else was doing it
yeah i mean i think that's just a
statement of fact so
uh how much impact they had i don't know
no way to know
all right i've gone way over my my limit
and
i think it's time to go
yes arrogant are we defining arrogant
the same
i'm not sure if we're defining that word
the same
wouldn't arrogant
suggest that i
uh
i think your opinion is less than my own
on this topic that's what that would
mean right
but i don't think i'm disagreeing with
anybody
so i think it's arrogant if you disagree
i don't think it's arrogant if you agree
is it
somebody says you prefer smug i prefer
overconfident
will you accept overconfident
as a description of my demeanor
some of you said yes
if you if you think i seem overconfident
you are accurate
because that's exactly what i'm trying
to look like
i recommend it by the way being a little
bit overconfident is is exactly the
sweet spot what you don't want is to be
exactly accurate or underconfident and
you won't you don't want to be too
confident then you get into crazy
territory you want to be find out what
is the exact like reasonable amount of
confidence
and then just 10 more
so so i'm trying to do that so i don't
uh i accept that as a valid criticism
but not anything i'm going to change
and by the way the
what you see as my
arrogance or overconfidence
is part of the reason people come
because
even even things that are annoying are
attractive
meaning
attractive in a weird way like a car
accident you can't look away so some of
it's like a car accident you can't look
away and i'm completely aware of that
uh speaking as if you are the only
intelligent person here is not have i
done that
how many
how many you think that character is
characterizes me have i spoke as if i'm
the only intelligent person on here
i don't think so
i'm
i'm saying no's and yeses
so apparently there's a difference of
agreement
in my opinion this is the smartest
audience
on the internet
like literally
i'm not just buttering you up
i believe that if you've gone through
all of these you know live streams with
me
i'm positive that you're smarter than
the average like a lot
if i don't say that enough maybe i
should
how many of you would agree with that by
the way here give you a chance to
compliment yourself how many of you
would agree with the notion
that your ability to reason or at least
to detect bs
has been improved
by watching my live streams how many of
you think you got something out of it
that's a life skill
on locals it's all yeses
um
see lots of
okay let's see
so youtube just stalled out for a minute
here
all right so lots of yeses on youtube as
well
right and i think that all of that um
that training specifically about
spotting illusions
is one of the most useful life skills
you could ever have
so i don't think it's an exaggeration
to say regardless of what i don't know
what the education level is or whatever
of the viewers i don't have a good sense
of that but i would say in terms of just
understanding how to
analyze a normal situation
you're way above average way above
average
top 20 percent at least
uh
i think i just can't find this way to
the end here you know what's happening
is uh i just enjoy this interaction
and so
uh
there's no school so i don't have a
reason to leave at the moment
all right that is all for now though so
i will go talk to you
later sorry if i seem arrogant
