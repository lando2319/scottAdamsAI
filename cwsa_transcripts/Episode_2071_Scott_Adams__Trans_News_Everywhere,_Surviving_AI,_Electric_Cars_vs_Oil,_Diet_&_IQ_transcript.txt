foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a finer moment in
your whole life
and if you'd like to take it up to
levels that no one's ever seen before
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker jealous of Style again teen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dopamine the other the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous ship
and it happens now go
oh yeah that's that's the good stuff
yes it turns out
in case you were worried about my health
my health is perfect
but sometimes you have to sleep more
than three hours a night so after after
yesterday's debacle I just went right
back to bed I just slept until noon and
then I felt great all good
so sleep
it's kind of a miracle drug
well what's in the news there's an
account I follow that I don't think is a
real person
called Tyrone Williams he says a lot of
controversial things but some of the
very interesting things he says is I
didn't realize that there was a science
about IQ and nutrition and apparently
there's a lot of it I don't know how
much it is reliable
but one of the claims is that when
iodine was added to Salt it increased
IQs by 15 points in the United States
does that sound true
do you think that iodine added to Salt
increased IQs by 15 points
MC's yeses and those that seems like a
stretch but the larger point is
apparently there are a number of
things like calcium magnesium and
folates
and probably some other things vitamin D
maybe there seem to be really correlated
with intelligence
how hard would it be to pick some poor
part of the country
and just say hey work on this experiment
we'll give all of you poor people good
supplements good nutrition just see what
happens
might take a long time to see what
happens but I think by the third grader
so you'd know if their IQ was you know
boosted
so I would love to see that
uh it really makes me wonder how much
of the IQ differences that there are in
the country are genetic and how much are
nutritional
because the nutritional stuff
we probably need to fix
if only for National Security
doesn't it seem to you that it would be
a national security issue to have
educated and healthy kids
it's hard to separate education and
nutrition from Homeland Security
because if you don't do it all right you
you lost no matter what
yeah obesity Etc
so Michael schellenberger says that he
has a whistleblower
information
saying that he and the other Twitter
files authors are going to be targeted
do you think that's real
because Matt taibi has already been hit
pretty hard
um with some fact checking some of it
may be important some of it not
and I think Barry Weiss and Matt
sheldonberger are going to get attacked
as well
now
I don't think any of them started as
Republicans or conservatives
but simply because they're not
pro-democrat narratives
that's enough
apparently they are being what's the
word
starts with an H
o haunted
they're being hunted
that is the best prediction I ever made
that was the the least obvious
although I've had some pretty unobvious
predictions yeah they're literally being
hunted according to a whistleblower
now keep an eye on them you might have
to help protect them
but I love the fact that the people
being hunted
do have some recourse now you can go on
sub stack you can go on locals you can
go on Rumble
you can go on true social so apparently
getting canceled is not what it used to
be but uh better better protect those
three authors I think they're too
important to to let them let them swing
on their own so
well I just would like to put in the
word that uh those of you who protected
me when I got hunted and canceled
I appreciate it immensely
just immensely changes everything really
the fact that there's some way to still
monetize your life if you've been
canceled
so protect those three uh authors I
think I think the world is better with
them well you may have noticed that all
the news is about trans issues
it's all I think 50 of the headlines are
about trans
it's the weirdest phenomenon just to
give you an example
uh I think this story is fake or maybe
not but does anybody know if it's true
that the first female VP to head Bud
Light
that there's that for the first time
they have a woman who's in charge of Bud
Light which could explain a little bit
about the Dylan mulvady connection
you posted it four days ago but I don't
know if it's true
uh I know I've seen it but apparently
the LinkedIn profiles changed so I'm
going to say that's a maybe
it's in Forbes okay
it's probably true
so do you think that it's a factor that
the VP of Bud Light is a female
do you think the fact that she's female
is why this happened
we don't know
stop being a bunch of sexists you
misogynists pieces of garbage
how could you possibly know that it's
only happening because she's female
you don't know that there's no way you
could know that
I I now certainly
certainly my bias agrees with you
if I were to check my bias it very much
is screaming at me
a man would never have done that a man
would never have done that
but is that true
I don't know if that's true because I
think a man or a woman might have some
external forces and may feel the need to
bow to some external forces do you think
that the VP of Bud Light has a boss
yeah because it's only the VP is the CEO
a man
I don't know probably right so there's
probably a man who made the decision so
I'm not sure I'm not so sure you want to
jump on the diversity higher on this one
I I think you need to raise your game a
little bit higher than
there was one time a woman did something
that's that's not that's not exactly
evidence
right
but could be a factor you never know I
just wouldn't assume it
um then we've got uh Trans in sports
so the Biden Administration is proposing
some kind of new rule for K-12 and
um mostly for college and K-12 that
would ban it would ban any trans bands
so it would ban the Bands
so you would not be able to say no trans
athletes can compete
in the the gender that you don't want
them to compete in I guess
now there is however a
um exception
and the exception is that the schools
would be permitted to adopt uh
uh wouldn't be permitted to adopt a
one-size-fits-all in other words you
couldn't ban trans
in general
but you could ban a trans a specific
trans for a specific sport
if you thought it was dangerous where
there was some other good reason
I'm perfectly good with that
does anybody have a problem with that
let me let me give you my Universal
example
um in my in my town there was at one
point there was an 11 year old kid a boy
who was so good at soccer
that he was elevated to the the teenager
league so he's like 11 years old but I
think he played with 14 and up which are
big big difference now did it make sense
that they would take this one 11 year
old who was really really good at soccer
and and put that one kid in a league
where normally he would not belong
of course it does of course it made
sense
it made complete sense because if you
were playing against him and you were 11
years old how fair would that be it
wouldn't be fair at all the kid would
have just annihilated you now I had the
privilege and it was a privilege to
actually watch him play
on a team with you know older older kids
and adults I watched him play indoor
soccer and it was a treat
watching this 11 year old just just
totally you know dribble around adults
and stuff and I got to tell you
um it made sense to put him in a
different League
for everybody's benefit
now
11 is not 21 I don't know what that
comment means
um however
I think the same is true of trans
athletes
there certainly are cases where the
trans athlete does not belong on a
woman's team
we all agree with that right
there are certainly cases where that
trans athlete would be so dominant or so
or so dangerous wouldn't make sense but
does it make sense to have a universal
band
when one of the athletes could be Dylan
mulvating
do you think Dylan Mulvaney would have a
big
genetic advantage over female athletes
in high school
you think yes some people say yes I'm
going to say no just for argument's sake
because uh Dylan Mulvaney looks about
the size of a
female athlete in high school
doesn't look like more muscles doesn't
look like more anything now I will agree
with you that just having the advantage
of male
you know male chemistry for early years
probably gave some advantages
but not enough
not enough if you put dilemma of any
other soccer field with a bunch of
high-level
you know college or high school players
I don't think Dylan would do so well
so I'm I'm completely in favor of this I
didn't think I'd be this much in favor
of a Biden policy but this makes
complete sense
now who who is arguing with the school
having the judgment to do whatever they
want
how are you arguing with that I mean
seriously how are you arguing with that
just let the school do what makes sense
if the Biden Administration says don't
do a universal ban
but you can make every decision
individually that's that's As Good As It
Gets
I don't have a single complaint with
that
all right but think about it let that
sink in a little bit more I think you're
going to like that more than you think
you may have you might be having a first
reaction
to it just because it's a Biden policy
it's not meant to be pro-trans or
anti-trans is meant to be pro-common
sentence the Common Sense part is you
can make an exception for any athlete
that's all I ask just make an exception
for any athlete for whatever reason you
think is good for the kids whatever
reason
it could be the physicality or any other
reason
that's fine with me
all right we'll see how that works at
least as an experiment it makes sense
um
so I love watching Fox News
try to do a reverse on Democrats
so remember how the Democrats made a big
deal out of President Trump saying that
uh at on January 6 saying that you
should protest or fight like hell
I think he used the word fight
now he used it of course in the
hyperbole meaning verbally fight or
protest
but not physically fight now in context
it was obvious he did not mean physical
violence
that's not what the word of fight meant
in that context it was obvious
but because he said it and because it's
politics they could say oh you said
fight that's violence
well turnabout is fair play and Korean
Jean-Pierre
um have said about the trans situation
blah blah blah kids are resilient the
lgbtq plus kids are resilient they are
Fierce they fight back
they're not going going anywhere we have
their back this Administration has their
back so because she said they fight back
the headline in Fox News was Jean-Pierre
slammed for praising trans kids who
quote to fight back stochastic terrorism
from the White House
really
is that a stochastic terrorism because
fight back in this context means
physically no I don't think she meant
physically
I don't think she meant physically but
neither did Trump
neither did Trump however
given that the Democrats did use this
trick against Trump
is it not fair play
is it not a fair play to give it back to
them it is it is fair play
it's not news all right so if I said
this is this is good solid news
reporting it's not this is not good
solid news reporting but it is fair play
it is giving back what they gave
and then of course this gets to be
juxtaposed at least on the Fox News site
and by the way the moment I was writing
this down
Fox News changed their website
like so they've moved it originally it
had the John Pierre story and also below
it a separate story about athlete Riley
Gaines being assaulted by a trans person
after a speech she gave talking about
Trans in sports
now if you have a headline that says
stochetic terrorism trans fight back and
then the very next story below it is an
actual attack by a trans person on a
non-trans person
that's narrative
right that's not news that's narrative
but to their credit
maybe it could be an accident or a
coincidence but they did take off the
other story they they demoted the Riley
game story
which at least is half right
you know I wouldn't pair those two
stories on the front page
that's a that's a narrative right even
though they're both true even though
they both happened if you present them
that way
it makes it look like there's some kind
of trend toward trans violence I don't
know how much of that there is
now of course everybody can be offended
by
um this trans person attacking Riley
Gaines who is only giving a speech and
certainly had a right to do that so we
can condemn it
but at the same time
how much of it happened yesterday
one time
you know as much as we condemn it
probably happened once yesterday in the
entire United States so I don't think
it's much of a trend
um but I'm interested that Vivek
ramaswamy and Jordan Peterson both talk
about uh that incident as uh well this
is what Jordan Pearson says
um a transgender male wearing a dress
so they're basically both of them are
calling the attacker a male or a
biological male
I feel as if the whole
wrong pronoun thing
is starting to Fall Away
are there enough uh notable people who
are refusing to call a trans athlete
necessarily a woman
are there enough famous people who are
rejecting it now you can do it without
getting canceled
I'm not ready to do it without getting
canceled yet
because I still think I still think
there's a
here's my problem with it here's my
problem I think that we're conflating
the people who have mental illness
with the people who have something
actually going on in terms of their
their gender dis dysphoria or dysmorphia
or whatever it is don't you think that
there's two categories
don't you think that there's other just
mentally ill or just gay men who like to
wear dresses and are adopting a
lifestyle versus people who have
something legitimate going on
and I feel like when you throw the
legitimate people in with the mental
illness people
you're not getting a good outcome like
it doesn't make sense to mix those two
groups and I feel like everybody's doing
it like I feel like you know Jordan
Peterson and uh Vivek may they may be
going a little bit too far in the
calling it men with dresses that may be
a little too far
but I also don't know
what the percentage breakdown is is it
90 mental illness or one percent
how would I know
because you know there's mental illness
everywhere it wouldn't be a big it
wouldn't be a big surprise if trans
people have some mental illness like
everybody else in the world
yeah I don't know so I guess I'm
uncomfortable branding the entire group
as men in dresses
when in fact there might be some of that
by how much
one percent or 99 no idea
um a judge said
just looking at this comment
they weren't applying the trans band
equally
uh oh so you'd have to apply it equally
I don't know I don't as long as you
ignore the trans part and focus on the
physicality part I think you can do
anything you want
because
we'll give you another example there was
a kid in my class when I uh when I was
young
who was unusually muscular
and bigger than most of us
and from you know early days he was just
way more muscular I don't know how and
just way bigger
so he sometimes would be put on the the
older kids teams if it was something
dangerous like you know full contact
kind of sports and I had no problem with
that
yeah no problem at all because he was
just too big to play with regular boys
he was just too big he would have hurt
us I had no problem with that at all
um I don't think he did either
so this is weird so Biden is green lit
two big energy projects
so I'm a little confused about where
Biden is on carbon
because apparently he's he's green
lighted this Conoco Phillips massive oil
project
in Alaska
and he's green lit uh bidding for oil
auction sites or gas I guess oil and gas
drilling in the in the Gulf
so those are two very big things where
Biden is pro carbon
but he also canceled that pipeline
and he's canceled other things where
where is he exactly I feel like he's all
over the place
now I wouldn't call it flip-flopping I
would just call it inconsistent
because it's not like you changed his
mind on a specific thing it's rather
that he rejected some things and he's
accepting some things but they look kind
of similar from thirty thousand feet
yeah my guess is that he just has to he
just has no choice
so it might be you know lobbyist money
but it also might be that the country
can't handle not having energy
it just might be too big of a risk even
for him
do you think it's location
that it depends where it is and that's
the bigger factor that might be
anyway that's just a question to me
so then he's also promoting electric
cars at the same time they saying that
the standard should be tightened for gas
cars and
here's the problem we don't we don't
have enough batteries
if you go full electric cars you you
have more dependency uh more dependence
on China because they make most of our
batteries so here's my suggestion
we should negotiate with the cartels in
Mexico
and tell them that we'd like Mexico to
turn into our biggest battery and
rare earth mining place because we want
it to be physically close
because I think that matters too don't
you wouldn't you like to know that your
batteries did not have to travel on the
water
I I feel like that would be a big big
advantage that you don't have to ship
your batteries over water
because it would be easier for somebody
to blow up your ship full of batteries
or to I suppose it would be very bad if
they if the ship sunk you wouldn't want
to you wouldn't want an ocean liner full
of batteries at the bottom of the ocean
would you it sounds like a bad idea
so I'd like to see the cartels negotiate
with them this way hey cartels
we're done with the old way
so you get two choices one is we're
going to send to the military and wipe
you out no matter how long it takes
the other choice is that you can give up
now
and we can turn you into Equity owners
and maybe somehow productive in this
Cobalt mining
you know battery making world
so that at least the leaders of the
cartels could say okay I could at least
have good jobs for my top hundred people
because probably that's where it ends
right if you if you take care of your
top hundred people
you're probably pretty happy in your own
family so I would try to convert them
instead of trying to kill them
I would try to convert them into uh
the the most important energy industry
as long as they didn't have management
control I wouldn't give them 51 control
of anything but you could imagine saying
to them we're going to put you out of
business but if you go willingly and you
help us close down all the other illegal
stuff because yeah the cartel leaders
would know how to close down their own
operation better than anybody if you
help us we'll give you a small
percentage of equity in these good
businesses and you'll just be Rich
Forever
your family will have
money forever
and you'll never be hunted
now they probably do need a lot of
security because they've killed a lot of
people
but there must be some way to make a
deal
and what we need is to move our
batteries like really really quickly
to be closer to here and I don't think
we'll be able to make those things in
the United States because of
too many environmental reasons Etc
what do you think of that idea
close down the cartels turn them into a
battery making country
and then there are best buddies because
we need batteries all the time and it
would be a it would be a gigantic
industry
the size of the industry could not be
understated
all right yeah I'm sure there would be
problems but there would be problems no
matter what you do
all right
so uh
here's on immigration Rasmus and edipole
that no surprise Republicans are favored
for immigration policies so this is one
of the few
um
few topics where Democrats will leave
their party
not necessarily to join the other party
but they'll vote against their own party
on immigration
because they think the Republicans are
going to keep the Border more secure and
of course they're right I mean that's
obvious
um
so it's a pretty big difference so 86
percent of Republicans trust their own
party but only 73 percent of Democrats
trust their own party on immigration
is it my imagination or will Immigration
completely leaves the news as we get to
within one year of the election
I believe that immigration will just
disappear from the news
and it will all be focused on trans
rights and stuff where Democrats do
terrible I'm sorry the stuff where
Republicans do terrible the news is
going to be about abortion
where Republicans do poorly
and LBGTQ
where Republicans do actually great but
the way they talk about it is a disaster
the Republicans just shoot themselves in
the foot with all of the the trans stuff
if they just talked about it differently
they'd be fine just talk about it
differently
um
yeah the media decides the topics
so
um I've got some some suggestions for
Republicans a little while but let me
talk about something else first
so I saw a uh one of these success Guru
Types on Instagram
who had a reframe that I wonder if you
think came from me
so this might be more relevant to the
people on locals because I think you've
seen me say it before on YouTube maybe
you've not seen me say it but correct me
if I'm wrong and the the reframe goes
like this
imagine you just woke up into this life
like it's a video game
you have a history but you didn't live
it so it doesn't affect you yeah so
there's like a memory of a history but
it's irrelevant you just appeared today
and a back story was written how would
you feel
if you just appeared into your life and
you said all right make the best of this
life you just appeared
what do I got oh okay I got a job
okay job's pretty good what do I got I
got oh my family
family is pretty good now you could be
the example that the guru gave was if
you'd been recently divorced
he said if you were recently divorced
you're still living in the past probably
like you're just you know your grief
about things that didn't work out but
suppose you just popped into existence
at that moment in time
you wouldn't be worrying about your
divorce or what went wrong you just say
okay what do I have and what do I do
with it and it would just change your
frame of reference have you heard me say
that before
because I loved seeing that somewhere
else I'm pretty sure it came from me
pretty sure but I couldn't you know it's
possible somebody else came up with it
um and I've never seen it before
I started saying it
so I think it came for me so the way
that I track my influence is to see if
unusual thoughts make it into the public
and that was a pretty unusual thought
um has anybody seen that before let's
prior to say this year had you ever seen
that before
I've never seen it
right well anyway keep an eye on that
uh Ann Coulter writing in Breitbart uh
she's on the team that says that the
Democrats are cleverly trying to uh bait
the Republicans into nominating Trump
because Trump can't possibly win against
Biden
do you buy that
do you buy that Trump can't be Biden
now I've said this before
but
aren't we fighting the last war
well if you assume cheating then it
doesn't matter who runs am I right if
you assume cheating
then it's all the same doesn't matter
who runs so that's not about whether you
run Trump or not
but
um don't you think it's a completely
different race
because the difference between wondering
what Biden would do and actually seeing
what he would do is a world of
difference
and thinking that Biden was too old at
his prior age
versus too old at what will be 86 if he
got reelected that's not the same
people don't see 86 the same as 80. I
mean 80 is crazy
but 86 is I mean that's just bad
that's just so so crazy right and then
you've also had uh uh Trump out of
office for a while
how do you think people feel about
January 6 today
compared to how they felt when it first
happened
I think January 6 is already gone
I think the news cycle has already
erased it because there were there were
no charges
and I think that it backfired
I think that it looked like a big
nothing I think that Tucker getting the
extra footage I think the the Q Anon
Shaman being released I think that story
looks completely different
and then on top of that you've got Kerry
Lake still picking at the election
Integrity maybe she comes up with
something
so far nothing
but she has some interesting allegations
about signature verification I don't
know what the the end story will be but
it's a real interesting accusation very
interesting
and we might find out something else too
so
um and then also take a look at things
that just went too far
would you agree that fentanyl has been a
you know gigantic issue for several
years but doesn't it feel like only
lately
everybody agreed it's gone too far
doesn't it feel like that
and that's the difference because you
know you know Trump would actually do
something about it or a republican would
and you know that a Democrat would not
you know the Democrat would not use the
military in Mexico but there are
definitely one or more now there are two
primary candidates for Republicans Vivek
ramaswamy and Trump himself who say they
would use the military
that's a big difference big difference
um
oh to Peter's point over here the the
issue of the political prisoners I think
is very Salient and current
so in in that sense January 6 is very
current because because the those
prisoners form a a tapestry of
Republicans being hunted
and that's that was very much a current
story because there's always going to be
a new Republican getting Hunted you know
there's always a new one so that'll stay
fresh forever
so that's a good point but the part
about
um
Trump
creating the violence I think that's
largely gone except for the the crazy
people
who never change of course
um
okay
yeah
so
yeah it was River time can you uh
correct me
my understanding is that Trump beats
Biden in polls today as if the election
were today
by a lot
was it ever true that Trump beat Biden
by a lot in any polling before the last
election
because I don't think he ever beat him
he never was ahead was he
was Trump ever had
against Biden I believe he only got
close I don't think he was ever ahead
oh there's a poll yesterday this
yesterday this is Biden's up by two
well you're going to see both those
kinds of polls but here's what I would
look for if the consensus of polls shows
Trump winning
I think he could win but of course all
that matters
all that matters is the swing States
right
so uh somebody said that Trump is not
ahead on the swing States
can anybody tell me if that's true or
not
so look into that maybe you don't have
an answer right away but it is true that
he doesn't have a lead in the swing
States now that would that would favor
um
the argument that he can't win yeah if
if Trump is not ahead in the swing
States that's a problem now I also heard
the following element
have there been enough Republicans who
have moved out of blue States and into
swing States like Arizona
that could change the election
is that a thing
I have enough Republicans moved into
Arizona that since even the last
election
I don't know if it's enough of a thing
but it might be I mean if somebody's
going to move for political reasons
they're definitely going to vote
if you move to another state for
political reasons you're probably
registered to vote
all right
here's my suggestion for Democrat or for
Republicans running for office
I believe that you could make
commercials for your opponents
and just play it straight and you would
win
right here is a commercial for your
opponent if you're a Republican
uh Democrats we'd like to take the guns
away from the people
and also let the criminals out of jail
so my big two big policies are I'd like
to disarm the law-abiding people
while letting the criminals Run free
that's the actual policy
did I add did I add any hyperbole to
that
now obviously they're not letting all
criminals Run free and they're not
taking all of your guns
but is it true that they're trying to
let more criminals free at the same time
they're trying to have you have fewer
options to be armed those are both true
do you think you have need to add any
hyperbole to that
those are just two stroke two true
statements
it's also true that Biden is tell you
you can't have your gas car
and you've got to be electric at the
same time he's approving massive energy
programs like you know the
basically you just have to describe it
uh Democrats are doing
you know you could come up with 10 more
examples you don't even have to
exaggerate
you can actually do the commercial as if
it's their commercial
and just fun and say we'd like to take
your guns away and let the criminals out
and just play it straight
and act like you can't make act like you
haven't made a connection between
letting criminals out and taking your
guns away like they're too unrelated
things and just give a commercial like
that just see what happens
it's a weird situation where you could
actually accurately describe your
competitor
and then that's all you need
you don't need to lie
all right
um
chat GPT is going to be part of Google
I'm sorry let me say that in a more
clear way that's completely inaccurate
Google search will take advantage of
chat GPT functions
so it's not a merger or anything like
that so
you knew that was going to happen right
because Bing is already doing it I think
but this is the this is the big scary
part
because it suggests the chat GPT will
have you know full access to the
internet of Google
and it's still a liar
I have no idea what's going to happen
but boy is it going to be interesting
boy is it going to be interesting
or a person isn't going to be
interesting to make it less sexist
and I would like to give you my
um
my best career advice in the age of AI
and also my best well this is also
career advice
advice number one
I was trying to think of things that AI
cannot take over completely
and I can't think of a lot of examples
but here's one
it will not be able to own a facility
for a human exercise
like a gym
humans will be able to own property
I don't think AI will be able to own
property for a long time so if you
wanted a business I would own a piece of
property
could be a gym could be a sports field
it could be an entertainment venue of
some kind but something where a human
can go to be entertained or to do Sports
because the ownership of an asset I
think might be protected for a while
and an asset where people can go and use
their bodies and and get entertainment
so that's my first advice
the second advice
is and this is what I'm going to do this
weekend I've been putting it off
I this is this is the strongest advice I
can give you unless you're retired and
even if you're retired
I'd do it anyway
it goes like this you need to take at
least two days off from everything
your job your family your personal life
and you need to figure out what's going
on with AI and you need to find the AI
applications or about 150 new ones a
month you need to find the ones that are
relevant to your life and to your job if
you have a job and you really need to
sign up for them and you really need to
use them
this is exactly like the dawn of the
computer age remember when people said
ah I don't need to learn how to use a
computer I'm already old
I'm already 65.
I don't need to use a computer
but then when you're 80 you needed to
use a computer and don't you wish you
knew how to use one
if you don't stop what you're doing and
I really mean just take time off from
work you need to walk away from
everything and just do the deepest dive
you can to figure out what's coming and
you need to refresh that every few days
you need to and if you say to yourself
that's a great idea I've got a vacation
coming up in three weeks no you're not
listening you need to do it closer to
today
something like today would be good like
I don't think any of us have a good idea
of how fast this is moving unless you're
right in the middle of it no you have to
do it today
three weeks from now is the end of the
it's the end of the Earth I mean
three weeks your whole job could be gone
you might need to find a new job in
three weeks
you want to give an you want an example
there's now an AI that will take your
book and turn it into an audiobook
and it's perfect
you just gotta feed at the text
it takes about an hour
and you're done
the entire business model of uh
audiobooks and people who are
professional readers of audiobooks it's
already gone
it's gone
it'll never come back
now at the moment the big Publishers are
still hiring humans to do it
but every one of them is looking at the
AI option they're all looking at it and
it's one year away from it would make no
sense whatsoever to hire a human the
human part is excruciating it takes days
of recording and then days more of
another human looking at all the edits
and fixing and getting the good one
it's just a mess
versus you just feed your book into the
machine and it comes out
as a perfect audiobook
there's no I mean you can't even compete
with that so that entire industry just
disappeared
what about editors they're still human
editors but the need for them is really
getting small
right so here's what might be a business
for a while
until AI takes I suppose in the finance
world
there are a zillion types of finance
things you could buy
but all you really need to do is get
you know an index fund of stocks Fortune
500 you'd be fine you wouldn't need any
advice just open a Schwab account or
some account put your money in an index
fund if you're not going to use it for
five years and that's all you need
but how many people do that
even though I told you exactly how to
everything you needed that was
everything you needed to invest I just
told you everything you need to know but
there's an enormous Financial advice
industry
why is that
why is there an enormous Financial
advice industry when I just told you
everything you need to know
put your money in an index fund Fortune
500 in the next one that's it
the reason is that people don't trust
that advice
because they don't you would have to
know as much as I know to know that
that's all you needed to know
so if you said to yourself I don't need
any expert to tell me how to use AI I'll
go use AI myself
and five minutes in you realize that
there are thousands of AIS that you
could possibly use and none of the AIS
will tell you which one to use
see like well this is just as hard as if
there was no AI
because instead of AI making something
simple
there were so many AIS doing slightly
different things with different pricing
and from different places that you would
need a human
to tell you which I AI to use
and probably that will never change
confuse Opera exactly
the confusopolies will pop up so that
one AI will not dominate right one AI
will say I'll use my industry audiobook
one of them is going to say yes we'll
make your audiobook but you have to
record using our software to make your
own you know Avatar you have to do this
and the pricing is something about the
recording but also the pricing is
something about the usage and then
somebody else will say we do that too
except it'll be free to record your
avatar and then the usage will depend on
different factors different levels and
what kind of job you are and then you'll
have two AIS
just way of two cell phone companies
and you'll say
um I'm looking at all the minutes this
one has I can share these minutes with
my family
but then this one has rollover minutes
I can't tell which one's better
that's called the confusopoly you can't
shop because it's too complicated
that's why AI is going to be
so you're going to use you're going to
hire a human
to tell you which AI to use
for a long time
probably and that human will have to be
you know using another AI to search the
other AIS to find out who's confusing
you and who's lying to you and then
there'll be Yelp for AI
so there will be not just one AI to make
audio books there'll be a thousand
it'll be a thousand
what do you do when there's a thousand
of them
how do you know which one is the good
one which one is the fake
probably a human probably a Yelp review
so it's really going to be hard
to trust AI when it's being made by
human weasels and you can spin up a
company in five minutes
all right so that is your career advice
take the weekend off as I'm going to do
and study as much as you can I'll tell
you the ones I'm going to be looking at
for sure just give you a
lay of the land here now your your
search would be different depending of
course on what things were interesting
to you but
I'm going to look at Deep Zen for
recording audiobooks audiobook dot uh AI
or IO I can't remember mid-journey I'm
going to look at Mid Journey for
creating art and of just text uh of
course I'm going to sign up for the
professional chat GPT version which I
haven't done yet there's something
called Deep fakes you can look into that
where you can make a fake it yourself
speech Kai it's also for audiobooks I
think something called descript
something called Runway
there's a product called Runway to make
a movie from text you just describe the
scene and it makes the movie
so these are all important to me because
I've got
um I've got two fiction books
that I could read into I think read it
into Runway and and make a boofie out of
it
now I need to know how to do that and I
need to know how to do that right away
[Laughter]
right away in a week it'll be a
different landscape
I mean I have to I have to dig in but I
have to stay there I can't I can't just
visit and come home I have to I have to
immerse myself in Ai and live it every
day now in order to be in business in
order to do just what I do
yeah now pretty soon there should be one
that gives me makeup and fixes my
physical appearance walleye live stream
yeah God's degree will be the first one
I do I'll make an audiobook of God's
debris as well as a movie
so that's what I'll do so I think what
humans will do is we'll own copyrights
for a while but they will become useless
I think quite quickly because of AI and
we can own physical assets which other
people might want to rent or use or but
other than that
it's going to be tough to make a living
so
can AI give me hair yes AI could put
hair on my head
although I think it would make me look
worse at this point
I don't know I'm pretty happy with my
bald head
which I suppose is good news I I I see
old pictures of myself with hair and it
looks weird
it just feels like there shouldn't be
like you shouldn't put a sculpture on
top of your head
that's what it feels like you know mine
is just utility like it's grown out a
little bit too much but what I when I
mow it back it'll just be basically my
head but
when I see somebody with like a like a
newscaster hair
I say to myself why would you do that to
your head
why would you put that newscaster hair
on your head because it looks like a
sculpture
or it looks like you just put a piece of
art you wore on your head or like an
ashtray it'd be like hey I wear a vase
on my head
why do you ask it looks pretty except
it's a hair vase
it just hair just looks wrong on men now
sorry
that's just my opinion hair on men looks
wrong to me now
it does I was just looking at a young
man yesterday and I was looking at his
full head of hair
and I said to myself I don't know it
just looks wrong
it just looks wrong and it's I'm not
talking about a fashion thing I'm not
talking about oh those young people with
their weird hair nothing like that has
nothing to do with your age or fashion
it's just starting to look wrong
somebody said Bill Maher yeah hair just
looks wrong to me Bill Maher is a good
example
Bill Maher's hair looks
it just looks wrong
it looks like he shouldn't have any
yeah Trump's hair looks the wrongest
that anybody's hair ever looked
uh
why do people with full heads of hair
shave their head because it looks better
yeah I feel sorry for the people with
hair
looks like a lot of trouble
all right I'm going to say goodbye to
the uh
people on YouTube thanks for joining
glad the news was a little bit more
interesting than yesterday and I'll see
you tomorrow
