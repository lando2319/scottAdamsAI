good morning everybody and welcome to
another highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Scott Adams
for a moment there I did forget my own
name that's probably not good
foreshadowing is it but I think we're
going to take it up a level even though
maybe you are not expecting such
Excellence this morning but you know
we're going to start start fast
and all you need to take it up another
level is do you know do you know do you
know yes you do all you need is a
copper mug or a glass attacker Chelsea
Stein a canteen jogger flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopaminea the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens just about now
oh
the gloriousness of this moment cannot
be understated
or overstated pick choose one
all right
I have a
I have a recommendation for you
um you know how social media is all evil
and it's killing us all
well there's an account on Instagram
that I'm going to recommend
it goes by my stepdad 55.
55 might be his age
or when he was born I don't know but my
stepdad 55 and it's literally this uh
friendly guy
who just does a video every looks like
every day in which he teaches you things
your father didn't teach you
it's freaking amazing
it's like one of the best things on the
whole internet
and all he does is he's he's this super
super like Pleasant guy
you know you you immediately wish this
were your dad
he is the most Dad Dad of all dads like
he takes dadness to levels of Excellence
that you've never seen before and all he
does is teach you stuff like
I think he's teaching to how to wash the
dishes how to make some meals how to do
some how to change your wiper blades I
actually didn't know how to change my
wiper blades
but he teaches yeah I just have the
dealer do it
uh let's see what else
um
so you have a sew by hand how to sew
how many of you learned how to sell to
like fix a sock or something when you
were a kid how many of the men
talk about the men how many of the men
learn to sew
I did yeah my mother taught me all those
skills or my grandmother my mother and
my grandmother Eagle Scout right yeah I
learned all those things I don't know if
anybody learns them now but it made me
think that
Instagram
um
and social media as damaging as they can
be
and how they've changed our our uh let's
say our brains and our attention span
but it made me think this
maybe maybe instead of condemning and
complaining about social media we should
take a tip from step dad my stepdad 55.
and use it for information
because if that's how people want to
consume things
here here he's made it interesting like
the reason the reason I recommend it is
not just because the information is good
but he figured out how to make it
enjoyable and short
think about how much you could teach
young people and adults too if you
created content that was meant to be
useful
and was interesting and short
think about it there's almost nothing I
wouldn't want to learn
if it were interesting and short
one of the things that YouTube does so
well
is I will watch a YouTube History
Channel you know a history lesson on
almost anything because it's short and
entertaining and well made
but if you said hey you learn this from
your history book I'd be okay uh you've
got other things to do yeah so I think
the the potential for um for Instagram
in particular maybe Twitter later is
some serious useful information
um you've seen all the relationship
advice that tends to be terrible and
apparently there was some guy selling
some kind of out of the liver King that
turned out to be a fake
so that there's tons of bad uh advice on
the internet but what if it were good
so right now you can't tell the good
advice from the bad advice
and Free Speech you know means you're
not going to change that but what if
what if you got good advice on social
media
it's possible there might be some way
that that could actually happen
here's the funniest thing about social
media uh you know the I talk about the
same characters practically every day
because they're the interesting ones
right if somebody's interesting
I can't help it they're just out there
being interesting and while I don't
personally like Andrew Tate I am so
fascinated
by the
let's say the phenomenon of him all
right
number one he does a great job of
getting attention and building an
audience great job but this is how good
a job he does I just want you to hold
this into your head and I don't need to
add any commentary to it
I'm just going to describe it accurately
and it goes like this
so Andrew Tate is at the moment one of
the most you know let's say he's getting
a lot of heat on social media good and
bad but he's getting tons of attention
and his audience is growing and stuff
and he basically is a cigar smoking
Whiskey Drinking guy who doesn't have a
stable relationship
who gives young men advice on health and
relationships
uh do I have to add anything to that to
make it funny
that's actually a real thing and and
just think about the world you live in
where I don't have to add any punch
lines to anything
I can literally just describe it
he's someone who's held up as a role
model for Health Fitness and
relationship information
who smokes cigars and drinks whiskey on
video
you know as part of his brand
and then he
clearly doesn't have any kind of a
successful relationship in his life
so oh and he's he's becoming Muslim
and and he puts his money in
depreciating assets
cars she has 17 uh expensive cars
those are depreciating assets worst
investment you could possibly make
do you think you can't get laid with one
Lamborghini
seriously do you need 17 sports cars to
get laid
foreign
it's not going to help you in your
relationship to have 17. and it's not
going to help you financially it's the
worst financial decision anybody ever
made so the other thing he does is give
financial decision Financial advice
while they invests in depreciable assets
okay
but uh so I have nothing but compliments
for his skill set his skill set is
really through the roof I mean he
definitely has the skill
there's no question about that but it's
just it's it's insanely uh
educational
to know that he can build a brand
around telling people the opposite of
what they're observing with their own
eyes
I don't know how he does it but he's
doing it well so it's working for him
here's a story I saw just before I went
live somebody has developed uh insects
that can eat plastic
and he's modified their gut biome
somehow so they actually digest plastic
and turn it back into its organic
precursors I guess if that's the right
word
Now isn't that great imagine if we could
solve all of our plastic waste problems
with insects that could eat our plastic
that's all good right
unless they get out of their low cage
what happens if one gets out
has anybody noticed that our whole
planet is made of plastic they would
basically destroy civilization
they would just eat all their they'd eat
all your car parts and you know your
computer would be destroyed
it's the best and worst idea I've ever
heard in my life
okay
but that's happening
all right this is uh the dog not barking
uh theme for today the dog not barking
most of you know comes from a
Shakespeare
Shakespeare the Shakespeare what the
 all British things look alike to me
Sherlock Holmes
not Shakespeare Sherlock not Shakespeare
see it was an obvious mistake both
British
both smart
both have a sh in their name
it was an understandable mistake
anyway yeah Sir Arthur and Conan Doyle
was the author so in the Sherlock Holmes
uh one of the cases was solved by noting
that the dogs were not barking
and instead of noticing something
happening
Sherlock Holmes was smart enough to
notice something that should have been
happening that wasn't and so this is our
lesson to all of you
don't just look at what's happening
ask yourself what should be happening
that isn't
and this screams out for this Balenciaga
story
so as you know there was one of the
photographs in a Balenciaga photo shoot
it's a fashion house in which uh some
some police tape showed
balenciago or the Bal part misspelled
with two A's b-a-a-l
who and now b-a-l coincidentally or not
happens to be a Canaanite demon god
uh Pagan's ritualistically sacrificed
children to this demon so it's the demon
of child sacrifice
all right now balenciago being accused
rightly or wrongly we do not know uh
putting what appears to be pedophile
positive images in their photo shoots
now that's the accusation
um but part of the accusation is that
there's no way in the world it could be
an accident that they that this Baal
thing was part of the shoot
and then it turns out that the the name
Balenciaga
if you break out the parts and you take
if you make the first part the Bal if
you turn it into b a a l then the second
part of it the NC AGA part means
something like you know praising that so
it means like praising the god of child
sacrifice now is that a coincidence
could be that could be it oh battle is
King right you said
the Balenciaga apparently means in
whatever language that that Bell guy is
King
now could that be a coincidence
absolutely
oh it's Latin is it Latin so could it be
a coincidence that the name Balenciaga
sounds so terrible in this concept
context that could be a coincidence yeah
to me that would not be a super big
coincidence it would be a funny one
but I would still call it a coincidence
right we see these all the time
but where's the dog that's not barking
does anybody see the dog not barking or
do you hear the dog not barking what's
missing in the story so far
what's the most obvious thing
that you would expect to know by now
that you do not know
are you really all missing this
where the name came from is interesting
but I don't think that's I think that's
going to be a dry hole
uh
thank you Erica the excellent yeah
here's what's missing uh Eric who said
who who ordered it like who who bought
that tape and who put it there
yes but uh I would generalize that a
little bit more and I would say how did
we get to today
without Balenciaga issuing a statement
that says oh about that tape
uh there's an innocent explanation and
here it is
where is it
isn't that the most obvious thing
that should have happened by now I mean
it's been days
you don't think balenciago knows
internally where that tape came from and
why it's there
of course they do
why they not telling you
Well it can't be a good reason
right do you think there's any do you
think that the heads of balenciago know
that the tape is a complete coincidence
accidental thing and they've just
decided not to mention it in public
they have a perfectly innocent
explanation
they just decided not to tell you
does that sound right
now how many of you didn't notice that
dog that wasn't barking you know raise
your hand in the comments if you didn't
notice that the most obvious thing is
missing
which one of your
um
news sources which one of your news
sources yeah yeah I think yes of it
which one of your news sources told you
that's missing
none of them
none of them nobody said that's missing
nobody said we asked for a comment and
we didn't get one did you have you heard
anybody say we asked balenciago to
comment on the Baal tape and they
decided not to or they gave us this
response right
where what the hell is going on
what the hell is going on that nobody
asked the most obvious question
well and weirdly most of you didn't even
notice it wasn't asked
you think Kim Kardashian asked she may
have asked but we didn't hear any answer
sticks did of course right yeah sticks
and Hammer did because it's an obvious
question for anybody who's a
an informed consumer news
give us some news
all right well there's gonna be another
one of those coming up there'll be just
as shocking
um how did we get to 2022
and I actually had a an exchange on
Twitter this morning
with an actual doctor
about whether white potatoes are good in
your diet or not
how in the world could that still be up
in a question that's up in there
now you might say to me Scott
uh the doctor told you they're good I'm
talking about russet white potatoes
if the doctor says there and and the
reason is apparently they rate high
according to one study at least in
satiety
satiety in other words it satiates you
or makes you feel like you've eaten
enough
and apparently it's way high on that
list on at least one study that somebody
showed me and therefore eating white
potatoes
it's a it's a good solid element of your
diet how many how many how many of you
would believe that
so satiety satiety
thank you
is pronounced satiety
okay thank you all right something like
that
all right so but but just to hold this
in your head for a second
imagine that it's 20 22.
and we can't agree whether a potato is
good for you or bad for you
now here's what I've been taught
that potatoes uh spikier glycemic index
white ones do these sweet potatoes not
so much but the white ones spike your
glycemic index and if you spike your
glycemic index it will make you hungrier
later
all right now
do you think there was anything wrong
with the study that says that white
potatoes are great for satiety
satiety in other words they satiate you
do you think there was anything wrong
with the study
well do you think you looked at potatoes
the way we really eat them or did it
look like a a baked potato or a boiled
potato
baked or
Victor boiled I think and it did not
include french fries
did not include franchise did not
include any fried potatoes you know like
hash browns or anything like that
did not uh did not include or at least I
didn't see mentioned what kind of
toppings the potato had
if somebody gave you some french fries
and they checked with you an hour later
and said we'd like some more french
fries you'd probably say yes I wouldn't
mind another french fry
no matter how full I was because I
really really like them
but suppose somebody said to you this is
a trial we'd like to eat you'd eat this
baked potato
and then you say hey excellent I like
potatoes and what am I putting on it for
topping
is sour cream and butter and
and all that and they go no no no we're
only testing the potato
you say what yeah just the potato so
just eat the potato
and then we're going to check with you
an hour later to see if you want some
more potato
so eat the potato with nothing on it
okay I'm glad they're paying me to be in
this trial
okay and then they check with you an
hour later and they say hey Scott would
you like some more potato you know what
I'm going to say I'm good I am so
satiated with potato I could not
possibly eat another potato man those
potatoes hit the spot don't get me near
another potato no no no I've had all the
potatoes I need for a week oh I'm good
on potato
in the real world nobody used to play in
potato
ever ever ever
now here's my detector rule
which I wrote about in
loser think I think here's the rule it
goes like this
one of the one of the red flags that
doesn't tell you for sure if something's
 but it tells you to look deeper
is if your observation your common lived
experience is at odds with the science
whenever that's true that should raise a
flag and say wait a minute is my
observation wrong
or is the science wrong
now my observation about eating white
potatoes is if I put them in my diet I
gain weight immediately
and if I take them out of my diet I
immediately lose weight
I've been doing it for years
for years all I have to do is put
potatoes in my diet weight creeps up
take them out of my diet weight goes
down and it's just one to one now if
you're telling me that you know 50 years
of experimenting have all been wrong
and if I told you that would you be
surprised that the studies that show
that potatoes are great at sautiating
you would you be surprised to know that
even in that study it says that other
studies say the opposite no of course
you would not be that wouldn't surprise
you at all because science on food is
complete now who was it who
funded the study on satiety of potatoes
who do you think funded the study I
don't know
I didn't look do you think it was Big
Potato
do you think there was anybody else in
the whole world who cared about
the potato study no no it wasn't it
wasn't big carrot it wasn't the carrot
people who said you know
I'd really like to fund a big study to
find out if potatoes that we do not sell
are good for people
no it was probably big potato
right
like who else would even care do you
think anybody else cared do you think
the scientists were sitting around
saying all right we gotta let's come up
with an idea
I'm really concerned about potatoes
I've looked at all the problems in the
world all the many things we could
conservate on and I'm thinking a little
bit more information about white
potatoes would be where I'd like to put
all of my scientific expertise no
somebody was willing to pay somebody to
study a white potato
who who would be willing to pay you to
study a white potato
there's literally nothing you can depend
on on food science many of you know my
story years ago I tried to start a
healthy
food product company to make a a burrito
that had all of your daily vitamins and
minerals and so of course I wanted to be
as well informed as I could to know what
was the right recommendation of those
things and do you know what I found out
very quickly
that food science
is not science at all it's not even
close to science pretty much everything
you know about food is a guess or
 or somebody paid for a
up study none of it's true the the only
as far as I could tell the only stuff
that's true is the stuff you can
immediately test on your own body
right
you know that if you eat a bunch of
sugar you feel different
you know that you know if you drink a
lot of alcohol you feel different
and you look different
right you know if you eat clean
you feel different and you look
different
you can see it you see it with your own
eyes and when the stuff you can see with
your own eyes
differs from the science which one are
you going to believe
if it were a different topic I might say
believe the science okay you know
because science is is the way that you
make sure that your personal
observations are not biased but the
personal observations are so consistent
and the science is so and not
credible that I would actually believe
my personal observation when it comes to
when it comes to food I would actually
believe that over science
yeah because I don't think there's any
reliable signs on food right now
all right
um let me tell you something that
happened years ago I dated a woman
who was just crazy
and I'll put that in quotes crazy uh
about re eating clean
eating food that was organic and had no
additives and no preservatives
and I got to tell you
she was the healthiest looking human
being I've ever seen in my life
like she screamed healthy and her diet
was just perfect
now you want to make a um a billion
dollars in the food business I'm going
to give you an idea for making a billion
dollars and this will be
um
this will be a persuasion tip
start a company that's organic food with
no preservatives
and mostly it's just fresh stuff it's
like a farmer's market but it's there
every day so you're getting like direct
from the farm just like the farmers
market but it's just there all the time
and here's what here's how you totally
put every other company out of business
you name it
clean food
clean food and you mean it two different
ways the food is literally washed and
nobody can get near it until they're
buying it
how much do you not love the fact that
when you go to the supermarket everybody
is standing next to the broccoli that
you're going to pick up and eat
I don't like it I don't like everybody
breathing on my broccoli before I buy it
even if I wash it I don't like that so
suppose you said all of our food is
behind glass
but if you reach through with I don't
know with your plastic gloved hand or
something you could put it in your
basket so imagine that first of all
nobody else can touch your food
after it's been washed
so the company washes it
company washes it and then you can get
it now hold on I haven't made my whole
case there so don't get ahead of me
secondly you say that your food is clean
because it doesn't have preservatives or
additives
right now here's why this would put
every other food company out of business
because as soon as you create that frame
that some food is clean and some is not
you can never you can never eat the
other food again
it would be the kill shot of all kill
shots so do you want some clean food or
you know the other kinds
just think about it
everybody we're all designed to prefer
clean food meaning it's as much food as
it could be and is less less
entertainment and less additives and
stuff
if you named your company clean food
you would just put everybody out of
business
think about it now
do I believe that you should avoid all
of those germs no nope I've told you
before that you should see a a baseline
level of germs in your life you should
see us creating good health
they should they make you healthier
because they challenge your your system
on a regular basis right
so what's healthy is for you is that
your food is a little bit imperfect
but that's hard to sell
all right do you remember a long time
ago I've said this so many times you're
bored with it but I told you the reason
we can't get AI to sound exactly like a
person is that we don't realize that AI
is already smarter than us and in order
for AI to act like a person it would
have to act like an who didn't
know too much and then you think that's
a real person
and you can't fool me that sounds real
to me that person is a jerk very selfish
and seems to only care about they self
yeah that's a person and I actually
heard an AI expert finally agree with me
and the AI expert said
one of the ways that you could determine
if you were talking to an AI is you
could ask it a hard question
I thought oh that's true
because AI can answer hard questions
so if you said to the AI all right
what's the capital of albonia
and the AI would know
but no human would
so you could immediately detect an AI
just by asking any hard question
and unless they lied
you say I I know a person wants best
answer that have you seen the the
interview on the street Series where
there's there's a guy who asks usually
young people ask them questions about
general knowledge questions about the
country
and then whatever they say no matter how
ridiculous he goes right
and he agrees with them and that's
that's the punch line and then they feel
like they got it right it's hilarious
every time he does it he says right
right no he says yes he says yes so
he'll go up to somebody who say uh can
you name two states in the United States
and they'll be like oh two states wow
States there's a
New York is New York one and he'll say
yes name another and they'll be like
Philadelphia Philadelphia is a state and
he'll look at them and go yes
hahaha
it never gets less funny every single
time he looks at him he goes yes
because you watch the person being so
happy that they got the answer right you
know on on film
it's diabolical anyway
um
mayor Eric Adams no relationship to me
um said that they need to remove the
seriously mentally ill people from the
streets
so they're going to remove all the
seriously mentally ill people from the
streets
now here's a question
uh did somebody just have that idea
is that an idea that nobody had until
now
or is that an idea that Dr Drew has been
screaming at the top of his lungs for I
don't know five years that I've noticed
anyway probably longer they you have to
physically take them off the streets if
they're mentally ill and maybe the drug
addicts as well because there's some
people who just can't handle take care
of it themselves
so
when I was reading this story I had the
following thought
um if you were to collect up all of the
street people
and then you were to pull them
how many would be Republicans
have you ever thought of that
it might be a zero
yeah 25 it might be zero have you ever
heard of a republican Street person
I I don't know I don't think I have
why is that
do you have any idea why that is
David to Pape yeah I don't know maybe
veterans Maybe
Maybe
well it could be that the homeless are
not very political so it's hard to hard
to say
but the other possibility is if you're a
republican you probably come from a
republican family
maybe there's more support there or
something maybe there's more tough love
I don't know I just think it's
the the homeless are mostly Democrats
feels like
so I'm not sure that the homeless
situation is a homeless situation as
much as a homeless Democrat situation
so suppose Republicans started uh
framing it as homeless Democrats
what would that do
number one
it would make it look like it wasn't the
Republican problem to solve
right
if the problem is homeless Democrats
is that for the Republicans to solve
because Republicans just move out of the
city that they do Solve IT Republicans
do have a solution for homelessness they
move
am I wrong
every Republican has a solution for a
situation that isn't good
they fix it or they move
[Laughter]
so it's not a republican problem because
Republicans have a solution it's called
moving or carrying a gun maybe carrying
a gun but Republicans have solutions for
their own problems
they're they're taking care of it the
government doesn't need to solve all
their problems
do you know why I live where I live
one of the biggest reasons part of it is
I live in the most survivable place in
the world
because my it's not so cold outside that
I'll die from the elements most days and
I'm not so close to the ocean that'll
get killed by a tidal wave I don't have
hurricanes I don't have snow storms I do
have earthquakes but I'm earthquake
proof and I'm not on a fault right so
basically I've you know picked a life
that's the safest it could be
but one of the main things I picked was
I was far away from homeless people
far away from homeless people
intentionally
and so I just said huh
if I don't want to live around homeless
people what can I do about that can I
change all the homeless people into
non-homeless people well if I could if I
could and that was good for them I would
but I can't
so I'm solving my problem
now did I not solve my problem
did I not solve my homelessness problem
yeah I moved away from it and and when
people say Scott how would you like to
go to San Francisco for some fun I say
no no how about we don't go to San
Francisco and that's our fun
how about instead of
going to the pumpkin patch or some
 thing that nobody no male wants
to do how about we just don't do that
how about that solve my problem
problem solved
uh I saw the funniest stand-up comedy
about it some guy who said that no guy
wants to go to the pumpkin patch
is that true that that no husband wants
to go to the pumpkin patch oh we'll go
we will go to the pumpkin patch we will
but no man wants to go to the pumpkin
patch because once you get to the
pumpkin patch it's just looking at
pumpkins and it's not really interesting
all right
um I saw an article on CNN that
correctly to their credit uh criticized
the fact that Merriam-Webster has
entered gaslighting into the dictionary
but they did it wrong
which I should have mentioned but CNN's
uh
uh uh opinion piece did and
here's a
here's what's wrong with the
Merriam-Webster Dictionary gaslighting
is not just lying
now you you probably remember I tried to
tell you this and I just gave up because
common usage
does change the word right so Gaslight
it used to mean not just lying
but lying about something that's so
obviously a lie
that you question your own sanity that
someone could say it with a straight
face
so it's the questioning your own sanity
that makes it gaslighting otherwise we
already had a word for lying
the word for lying was lying we didn't
need a new word so gaslighting was not a
synonym for lying it was a whole
different concept
but because the Democrats used it for
three years against Trump for just
regular lying
Merriam-Webster I think finally just
gave up and said all right well I guess
that's the definition now so now it's
closer to regular lying
so I'm gonna you know as an author
I accept that language changes and I
guess this is a change that happened you
know it wasn't wasn't my first choice
but uh looks like apple however
we should not lose sight of the fact
that the the original gas lighting is
still a thing even if it lost his word
it no longer has its own word but it's
still a thing and here's some examples
of it in the news
so
um
what is her name the spokesperson
Biden spokesperson what's her name
uh
Karine John Pierre
now the reason I cannot remember her
name if you haven't noticed
she has a three-day name which first of
all is abusive
that's abusive you know I can remember
one name sometimes too you tell me I
have to remember three names and I'm
probably out
and I'm never and I'm never
let me say two things if you have a name
that could be pronounced plausibly
pronounced two different ways that's not
my fault
that's not my fault
all right and likewise if you have if
you have a name where all three of your
names are really your first name
right because Karina is the first name
uh genre's first name and Pierre is the
first name
and Jean and Pierre are a guy's first
name so I mean it's really hard for me
to store this memory you know everybody
stores memory differently like I never
store exact memories like phone numbers
I can't remember names and phone numbers
if they're unusual but I can remember
anything that fits any any kind of a
familiar form
because first I'll think of the familiar
forum and then it will remind me of the
specific
so if somebody has three first names I
can't remember that
because my brain says all right what's
her last name and then there is none
so it doesn't fit into my form so I
can't I can't remember it
so it's not my fault but anyway
she was asked about when when was uh
Biden going to visit the Border
and she said he's been there he's been
to the border and since he took office
now Apparently that is the world's
easiest thing to fact Jack
he has not been to the Border since he
took office
and yes she says it like straight out
and that doesn't correct it
no correction
that's very close to gaslighting now
it's just short of intentionally trying
to make you feel insane
but
it's a weird kind of lie now I think I
think Trump and maybe even Biden were
you know Pioneers in this kind of a lie
the kind of a lie where it's easy to
know it's a lie
it still works it still works because
the Democrats who who watch that what do
you think the Democrats concluded when
she said he has been to the Border
I'll bet a hundred percent of Democrats
a hundred percent said oh well he's been
to the Border I guess that was a dumb
question Fox News
don't you think do you think that there
was even one Democrat in the entire
United States
who saw her claim with a straight face
he's been there since he was elected
I'll bet there wasn't even one Democrat
who questioned that do you like
literally I bet not even one
maybe within the professional class but
within normal voters I'll bet not even
one could tell the difference
that's my bet and of you know 70 80
million people about not even one knew
that knew the truth
how many of the Republicans knew the
truth
probably half
there's a really big difference in in
knowledge
all right
um
Christie gnome governor of South Dakota
is Banning Tick Tock the app on state
state devices
so individuals can still use tick tock
in South Dakota but not government
agencies on their government equipment
ah
now what does that remind you of
what is my analogy for what Christie
gnome just did
she did something that uh DeSantis does
all the time
what's the free money thank you yes she
picked up the free money
who who exactly was going to argue that
government employees should have tick
tock on their government devices
was there somebody going to come out and
say hold on hold on governor
we would like to use tick tock on our
government phone
like nobody literally nobody could make
that argument this was free money
there will be people who agree with her
and then people who shut the up
because they don't want to argue the
case even if they think they should
this is the freest of free money
right now remember I told you this when
Trump started doing it early in you know
2015-16 he he always picks up the free
money he stopped doing that by the way
which concerns me
but DeSantis he was picking up free
money every day free money sure and
nobody's going to say this thing out
loud and I get free money if I say it
out loud I'll just say it out loud and
then he gets his free money
so
that's a real good sign for a future
leader if they can at least recognize
the easy stuff
right here's another one apparently
the Department of Agriculture the
federal government is still still buying
and using Chinese drones for their
agricultural survey
and we know that the chinese-made drones
can send their data back to China and
they could have all kinds of
you know information now I don't know if
the agricultural
information really is helpful to man I'm
not sure that China can get enough from
you know the information from a drone
over a farm I don't know if that helps
them or not but
don't you think we should ban that
don't you think you'd like to know who
is the biggest drone manufacturer that's
completely American
why don't you know that
why are we sitting here and if I said to
you oh
um the biggest drone maker by far is DJI
is that the name of the Chinese company
I think it is but what's the name of the
the biggest
American drone maker
I don't know and why don't you know that
yeah well I'm talking about the hobby
size drones the the ones that an
individual can purchase yeah I'm not
talking about the the big defense
contractors
so DJ DJI is the Chinese manufacturer
but what's the biggest American only
manufacturer of drones
you don't know
why don't you know
let me ask you this
all of you are smart enough by now
you're you're all well informed enough
to know that if you had a choice of
buying an American drone versus a
Chinese drone you might even pay more to
get the American drone am I right you
would pay a little bit more to get the
American one because you might think
that it's a little more data secure
so so what's the name of that company
so China wants to sell you Chinese
drones
and your press has never told you the
name of their competitor
think about it think about the dog
that's not barking
it's a huge story you see it in the
headlines everywhere
people should not buy Chinese drones
from a company named DJI
and what's the name of the other company
they should use I don't know I've never
heard it
do you think that's an accident
is it an accident that none of the
stories about the the drones that you
should not buy includes any reference to
the one that maybe you should buy
what what the hell is up with that
no I don't think locking boring Lockheed
Boeing
um and uh Raytheon I think they make the
big drones the military drones I'm not
talking about that I'll talk about the
the little ones that fly over your house
is act be real or are you joking I'm
seeing people say I could be drones but
Mattel
now I'm talking about like serious
industrial drones but not military
uh
but but seriously am I is anybody's mind
blown
that you don't automatically know the
name of the competitor to DJI
never even heard it
now some of you are saying EXO
but I've never heard that name
EXO
so that's the name of a drum
so you have to be sort of in the Drone
business to or you know a hobbyist
actually I've heard that so it looks
like EXO
now let's let's do a little search on
that
okay let's let's find this out right now
so EXO drones
EXO drones give them a little commercial
here if this is what I think it is
yeah so that is ex drones official site
and
uh let's see if the Drone
see if it comes up okay yep there we go
so you say these this is an American
company right EXO
uh can you confirm this is an American
company I don't want to mislead you all
right well you can check for yourself
but
but it's amazing you know we didn't all
know that at the top of our
tip of our tongues all right um
so musk apparently met with apples Tim
Cook and the
um and the outcome is that Tim Cook says
Apple never was considering Banning
Twitter from the App Store
they never considered Banning it from
the App Store
and it took
wait a minute what do I hear I hear
something ah yes is the dog not barking
can you tell me how many days it took
Apple
to respond that they were not
considering taking Twitter out of the
store
how hard was it for Tim Cook
to say oh no we're not considering that
three days right
so for three days
Tim Cook was never asked by any
journalist was this true
there was no journalist in the entire
world who asked Tim Cook hey is this
true in three days
come on
come on
come on
really really
like what's going on here
now did you also notice that dog not
barking
did you notice that for three days the
simplest thing that a person could do do
you know how easily Tim Cook could have
fixed it
oh looks like there's a rumor that's not
true now let me open up my Twitter app
at Elon Musk that's a false rumor we are
not considering Banning Twitter
one tweet
and would anybody would anyone have said
oh that's unprofessional
no that would be exactly the way to do
it one tweet no no that's not true do
has anybody ever tested the theory that
you can shoot down a rumor quickly with
one tweet yes Elon Musk does it almost
every day
almost every day Elon Musk tweets that's
a rumor that's not true
and as soon as you read it do you say to
yourself oh he's lying never never you
read it you go oh that's true
all right you just shoot them the rumors
like with no ambiguity nope never
happens
who do you believe I always believe Elon
Musk every time because when some when
somebody is that quick
to shut something down and they don't
leave any ambiguity no that did not
happen you know there's no wiggle room
there as soon as I hear that I go okay
that didn't happen
and Tim Cook
didn't think
that watching half of the United States
say they were going to sell throw their
their iPhones into the sea
like that didn't get him going in two
days he had something better to do
all right there's something very
unexplained here's what I think it is
let us speculate
what is one sentence that's always true
and always false at the same time
now I asked this on Twitter I got a
whole bunch of funny answers that are
worth looking at by the way look at that
tweet you'll see a whole bunch of funny
answers things that are true and false
at the same time
and here was by my entry this is always
true and always a lie at the same time
we were considering it
we considered it
it's always true
and it's always a lie
always true and always a lie
do you know why I know this uh for sure
I made a very big mistake once when
talking to my doctor years ago
uh I forget what the context was so this
was years ago and the doctor asked
had I ever considered ending my own life
and unfortunately I didn't think this
through
and so I said yeah every day
of course
I I consider it every day
so that immediately got me into the
mental health
I I managed to get myself out of it but
it immediately puts you into the mental
health
process
and now you've got to talk to a
psychologist and you'd better get on
drugs and you know basically
everything's in question at this point
right now stop everything they're going
to have to help you and then then I said
hold on hold on we must be using
language differently here you asked me
if I ever considered it
and I answered you honestly every day
and then I decided that it would be a
bad idea and then I go on with my day I
consider everything every day
when I run into somebody in the street I
think about killing them
I've just never been serious about it
if I if I see a attractive woman I think
about having sex with her
I just don't act on it
I consider everything
considering is just my mental internal
process
considering has nothing to do with the
likelihood of something's going to
happen those are completely unrelated
Concepts yes I literally consider
everything
and then I choose what makes sense
so did Apple ever consider getting to
Knocking Twitter off of course they did
of course they considered it the same
way I consider ending my life every day
even when I'm nowhere near any kind of
suicidal thoughts so just to be clear I
have zero intention of ending my life
zero
but do I consider it yeah every day
every single day along with every other
possibility in my life I consider
everything
so I think it's true that Apple
considered it and I think that when they
were asked are you serious
they said no
which could be construed as not
considering it
so
there are things that you consider and
you also don't consider them because
you're meeting the the terms in slightly
different ways right
considering means I thought about it in
my mind but in your mind it might mean I
took it seriously that's different
I think that's all that happened but I
don't know
just a guess
all right
Lee zeldin said the smartest thing that
a republican has said in
I don't know a year
maybe a year
every once in a while you'll see a
republican say exactly the right thing
and honestly I'm surprised because
Republicans are not super good at
messaging you know nobody is really none
of our except maybe AOC every now and
then and Trump and every now and then
but uh here's Liesel then getting it
exactly right
here's a tweet he says whenever they
they meaning Democrats whenever they
propose ballot harvesting totally oppose
it
whenever they pass ballot harvesting do
it so much better than them that they
deeply regret ever passing it in the
first place
all right standing ovation
[Applause]
so
here's the answer to your question
did you ever wonder how Lee zeldin did
so well he lost but he came incredibly
close in New York did you ever wonder
how a republican could get that close to
a Democrat state governorship
this is why
this is why
everything you need to know about Lee's
Eldon is in this one tweet
he just told you I'm smarter than all
the other Republicans
that's what I heard
I just heard I'm smarter than all of the
other Republicans because I just told
you exactly what to do which is the
right thing to do
that is leadership
right
that's leadership this is exactly
exactly the leadership I want and you
know what I would agree with this
whether whether I'm Democrat Republican
or independent
because we have a competitive system in
our competitive system we thought was
about getting the votes but it turns out
that our competitive system is also
about getting out the vote I mean we
knew that but we we need to extend that
to getting out all kinds of votes so Lee
zeldin is saying this isn't the game we
want to play
but if you're in the game
don't stand there while the ball
rolls past you
I mean you feel I feel like the
Republicans were like we don't want to
play baseball no we don't want to okay
we're on the field okay we're on the
team we are playing baseball but we
don't want to be here then somebody hits
the ball and it like rolls through their
feet and they're like ah I could have
picked that up and gotten you out but I
I didn't want to be here
so dumb
pick the ball up right Lee Selden is
telling you the most obvious logical
strategic thing to do there's no
complexity here at all
and and I will even go further
so I don't think Lee zeldin can say this
directly because he's in the political
sphere but I can
so here's my strategy for the
Republicans
whether or not they actually care about
their their people voting by mail
no matter whether they care about it or
not
they should say it's their number one
priority and they should tell
Republicans this is a vote by mail
election coming up you can also vote in
person but you should consider it a vote
by mail election if you're a republican
we're voting by mail this time if
there's anything you can do make it a
vote by mail and make sure that you've
Legally Legally helped everybody vote by
mail it was anywhere in your environment
and you bear you should check with
everybody especially the elderly
especially the people with special needs
you should make sure that all of their
votes are heard
that would scare the living out of
the Democrats
but right now the Republicans are
playing as stupid
they're like oh we hate it that you do
that ballot harvesting so successfully
what is that is that the leadership you
want
the leadership you want is complaining
that the other team is better that's it
oh I'd like to vote for the team that
doesn't do a good job on ballot
harvesting rather they complain that the
other team does a good job in a
completely legal process as far as I can
tell right like that's there's no
leadership there
Lee zeldom
just showed you leadership
so now who do you want to be your
speaker of the house
too late did McCarthy already get picked
or is that not until the actual that
can't happen until the actual majority
happens right after January something
right but am I wrong
like Lee zeldin is the best leader
who doesn't have another job well I
guess he has another job but
I know I they should think about him as
a speaker
um
neuralink is ready for human
testing if the FDA approves
so uh musk says that that's that's a go
and the potential uses for neuralink
which is literally a chip which they
literally will drill into your skull not
into your brain
but they'll put a little dent in your
skull and put a little chip in there
I'm not sure I'll ever be able to sign
up for that but maybe who knows
anything's possible but among the things
that might be possible with this little
chip is restoring sight to the blind
is that amazing or what restoring the
sight
to the blind
holy cow but also maybe restoring uh use
of the limbs to the paralyzed people
what
restoring restoring the use of your
limbs to paralyze people
like this is so futuristic I can't even
it's hard to even wrap your hand around
it
but what if it works
so I I think here's you know this is
certainly a signal that the cyborg age
is
is upon us now clearly we're already
cyborgs because even though your phone
is not physically attached to your hand
it sort of is
you know it's sort of attached to your
hand so you're already cyborgs but this
chip would make a little bit better
better even than the Apple watch to turn
you into a cyborg
well
um oh by the way what uh lee zeldin was
doing by saying that you should
um
Bell Harvest better than the other side
that's uh Embrace and amplify
so that's your your lesson on persuasion
today
so what instead of complaining about the
thing you don't like
embrace it as hard as you can
and use it as hard as you can and the
other side will immediately see it was a
bad idea
and that's what lies Alden is correctly
correctly suggesting
um
there was a YouTube presentation last
night of neurolink I bet that was
interesting
yeah sometimes I think we're all captain
pike
no one more than me oh you tagged me on
that okay I'll look for it
yes the refs aren't calling fouls
exactly
so there there was a good analogy which
I approve
um if the refs are calling it loose and
they're not calling fouls you should be
fouling
right right if the other team is
following you and not getting called you
should foul as soon as you can
immediately fell
that is correct strategy
um
now do you think that Apple uh may have
blinked because Elon Musk uh saying he
might have to build his own phone
doesn't sound like a bluff does it
yeah how would you like to play uh poker
with Elon Musk
where where nothing he says is really
ever a bluff
I'm going to build a rocket to Mars no
you're not
you're not going to build a rock at the
Mars no actually I'm building a rocket
to Mars
I'm going to build a chip that people
will drill into their skull and be happy
about it no you're not that's that's
freaking crazy nobody's going to put a
chip in their skull
uh maybe they will
so I'm going to build an electric car
when nobody thinks that's economical and
now I'm the most economical car company
of all time
so the last thing I would do
is say to myself you know
nobody can compete with apple on phones
at this point I mean Google and apple
have it all wrapped up there there's
nobody who could enter the market at
this late stage and make a and make an
impression
except
the one person in the world that you
would be afraid of who would be Elon
Musk
I'm going to make another prediction
I don't think we'll find out if this is
true but my prediction is this
Elon Musk already has a phone design
the specs not not a full design not a
buildable design but
I'll bet you somewhere in his messaging
or in his files
he's got an actual design for a new kind
of phone that would not use apps
I'll bet you
I'll bet you he's at least
intellectually engaged enough
that he would be super interested in
what that would look like like from an
engineering perspective how would you
build a phone
that would LeapFrog
current phones all right here's the
first way you do it
how often do you want to use your phone
but your hands and your mouth are busy
doing something else it's like all the
time isn't it do you know how many times
I want to Google something while I'm
walking to my car
like all the time and I don't always
want to take out my phone and look for
it here's what I like to do on the way
to the car I'd like to have a question
and I'd like to just think it and then
have it spoken back to my brain
or you know maybe I speak it out loud
when nobody's hearing you know maybe
it's a an audio thing in my ear but I
like to just be walking along
and say
what is the capital of albonia and then
in my ear it says
it's the capital of ammonia or something
like all day long I want to know things
that I should Google but I'm not going
to
so if neurolink
if neuralink could get to the point
where I don't need a physical phone
then your Apple phone is worthless
imagine if neuralink could get to the
point where you could see a screen that
other people can't see
if neuralink can give Vision to the
siteless it can also put things in your
environment that aren't there
I'm assuming right so could it do yeah
and it could do an augmented reality
where if you've got the chip in your
head
anytime you want a virtual screen pops
up that only you can see and you turn
around it just follows you and you can
just make it go away by wanting it to go
away
so imagine I'm walking to the car
and I think ah who is who what's the
capital of albonia Boop screen pops up
and and I see it on a map
I think that's where we're going now
would you have a smartphone that you had
to carry around in your hand
if you could do a hundred percent of all
the things you need to do just by
thinking it
that's where we're going so I think I
think Elon Musk is going to put apple on
a business
one way or the other it's just going to
take you know might take 15 years but I
think but I think you're do you think
does anybody think you're going to be
carrying a physical phone in 15 years
does anybody think that's going to
happen
I don't think so
that seems the least likely future
possibility
yeah I don't know what it will be but
it's not going to be a phone maybe it
might be glasses with a chip or
something like that
yeah
I feel like some kind of uh
technical glasses
are in the future because they have so
many potential uses everything from
sunglasses to
whatever
um
oh could it help with brain chemistry I
would think so
imagine if neuralink could help you
change what you think about
let's say you could just tell it hey
make me see images of happy things
puppies and kittens
think it would make you happier
now
um is anybody concerned I'm going to
just change the subject totally here
is anybody concerned that the
relationships
can't work anymore
like they sort of can't
I feel like we've crossed some kind of a
bridge here
socially and has something to do with
social media
something to do with I don't know
wokeness something to do with division
maybe I don't know but
it doesn't I don't see men and women
agreeing that they should even be
together
I'm seeing men and women both agree that
the other doesn't offer them enough
right
and the the general argument that I'm
seeing everywhere from both men and
women on social media goes like this
in the old days
there was a definite benefit to getting
married and having kids
the biggest benefit is that was your
retirement
you have to have kids to take care of
you when you're old and to run the farm
and to give you physical defense if you
had Sons
Etc so it certainly made sense
and then there was a period let's say
the 50s where uh if the man was working
and the and the woman was raised in the
kids as long as everybody was okay with
that
that was a system that seemed to be
successful
but we're in a different world now
and today if a woman offers
um let's say herself to a man
this is what I'm seeing on social media
the man says what are you offering
and the woman says well
uh of course I will be expensive because
I would expect you to take most of the
financial burden
because that appears to be the the thing
that we hear the most the guy says okay
so that's what you're going to take from
me you're going to take my money now
what are you giving me
and she'll say well I'll give you
children
and then the guy says okay so you can
guarantee that no matter what happens
with us I get to keep those children and
she'll say no no if something happens to
us
I'll probably keep the children
so he goes okay you're not really giving
me children
like you can't even offer that it's not
within your power
and then she says but
you don't have to worry about that
because I will offer you faithfulness
I I will be true to you and only
physical with you and then you don't
have to worry about us breaking up and
taking the kids then the man says um I
live in the real world
as soon as you're financially capable of
taking care of yourself and your kids
why would you stay with me when you
could find somebody better
and then she would say well that's a
good point I could find somebody better
because once I have enough of your money
and to have kids
you know who's going to look not so good
whoever you're living with is going to
not look good
because your co-worker is always you
know clean and well dressed and that's
the only time you ever see them
but you're at home you're saying you
know the worst of your mate
so
so women and men are asking the same
question what are women offering to men
in 2022 and I actually don't know the
answer to the question
I literally I'm not being argumentative
I don't know
what do they offer it's the most they
can offer is a 25 chance that you live a
happy life and get to see your kids the
whole time
is that is that something you want to
trade your whole
your entire net worth for
your entire financial future you're
going to trade for a 25 chance of being
able to see your kids in 20 years
I mean it just doesn't sound like
anything that anybody would do if they
were rational now I think that we're a
zombie culture
zombie culture and that we're doing what
we used to do even though it doesn't
make sense anymore
so we're still sort of running through
the oh I guess I'm dating and I guess
I'm supposed to get myself a wife and
you know so I think we're just zombieing
our way toward it with with no sense
that it makes any sense at all or that
it even could
you're saying feminists ruined
everything I don't know about that
maybe it was the economy that did
maybe it was consumerism that ruined
everything because then you needed two
jobs
you could take this a lot of ways
but am I wrong that women are not
offering anything to men that is
reliable
they do offer but nothing reliable or
lasting
would you agree
now is it the same the other way
would you say that men do not offer
anything to women
because I feel like they offer money
sometimes
and physical protection sometimes
but do men really offer physical
protection to women
think about it do men really offer
physical protection to Women Within the
house
are you women
tell me who is who has been your biggest
physical threat over the course of your
life somebody inside your house or
somebody outside your house
there's no competition
the biggest physical threat to a woman
is somebody is a male inside their house
right
I don't think in 2022 men protect women
I think men are a bigger threat to women
than they are a protection now obviously
it depends on the situation plenty of
cases where men are legitimately
protecting women right don't don't
have a heart attack over this all right
plenty plenty of cases where the man is
absolutely protecting the woman but what
I'm saying is
is a woman is a woman really seeing that
benefit
if you're a 20 year old woman
and the only time you've ever been
abused is by your own boyfriend
maybe once or twice
are you saying to yourself I really need
a man to protect me are you saying I
better live alone because the most
dangerous thing I can do is live with a
man
I know but so I I think the entire
what do we call it in business the value
proposition
I think the value proposition for both
the men and the women is that they're
not offering what they used to
not offering what they used to and how
about having kids
let me let me be brutally honest
in the old days like what I imagine the
old days in the 60s I think I think
having a kid was sort of a good deal
because you could interact with your
kids and sometimes you could do some
family stuff that everybody liked
do you know it's like having a kid today
if you don't have a kid allow me to give
you uh my impression in one act of all
of your quality interaction with your
kid after the age of 10.
uh-huh
yep
right right
uh
pretty satisfying wasn't it
yeah now that's the sort of thing you
want to organize your entire life around
because if you do everything right
you can get that
yeah you can have the satisfying
experience of having your kid not give a
 about your whether your
live or die they only care what's on
social media you get to make one of
those and then get to sit there and feel
like what you did wrong because every
moment you sit with that kid you'll
 hate your life because you're
like I love the kid but I hate
this
I hate this moment I hate dinner I hate
sitting in the car I hate walking with
them I hate having the conversation
off their phones try signing off a phone
has anybody tried punishing a kid by
turning off their phone
how'd that work out
I mean it happens all the time
have you ever seen anybody change their
behavior because you're turned off their
phone for a week
I haven't
I've never I've never seen any kid
change their behavior because they'd
lose their phone
because they just they just find they're
finding a laptop or an iPad usually
cernovich scares they'll say don't have
screen time
yeah so uh that's also true of people in
the tech business the the people who are
least likely to allow their kids to use
technology or the people make it you
know that right
the people who are least likely to get
hernia surgery are oh
what class of people are the least
likely to get hernia surgery
doctors who perform hernia surgeries
because they know too much
the people who make your technology are
the ones who don't let their kids see it
China doesn't let Chinese citizens see
tick tock
they have a version of tick tock that's
just like a you know propaganda version
China doesn't let their own citizens use
tick tock the people who know the most
keeps their kids away from it
that is not true well it's not true for
every person
your wife quit using her phone when
she's with you
wow
yeah they use the phone in school now
too that's right
Scott Nissan
all right well I don't have anything
else to talk about so I'm going to say
that's it for today
uh
uh oh I'm saying uh all true but you're
taking your personal hatred I don't know
if this is to me or to somebody else
your personal hatred yes we can be
brutally honest too of women to an
unacceptable level you're going to lose
people unnecessarily tone it down please
do it do I sound like a does that sound
like me
do I do I have I here's what I think I'm
doing
I think I'm just being a straight caller
of balls and Strikes
I don't think that men are adding enough
to women and women are not adding enough
to men so I don't believe that I'm
showing a bias against women am I
because I'm saying that neither is
giving enough to the other I just did a
whole explanation of how the most
dangerous thing to a woman is a man in
her own house does that sound like a
woman hating
no maybe he does maybe the truth is too
brutal or maybe you were talking to
somebody else I can't tell
what about Steve Jobs
yeah Steve Jobs didn't let his kids use
stuff again
um
so you married an Instagram model yes
what
what exactly is the point of that
comment
your equal blame is not the same
experience for everyone of course
you've been a little hostile toward the
ladies
back to November 9th when you said women
were toxic to men
women are toxic to men
yeah but that's a biological
explanation
the biological explanation is that the
the biological purpose of a woman is to
transfer resources from a man to a child
so there you go
I mean from a machine perspective that's
what the machine is doing the machine is
created these creatures where the the
shift of resources works very well for
keeping the Next Generation alive
all right
um
what
where is musk's election interference
release yeah we're still waiting for the
big report and of Twitter
man
you're calling Christina the Elder
now don't
don't yell at Christina
um
remember when you called your
relationships rental lives I do yeah I
think I think rental is going to be the
model that has to
there has to be at least tried by some
people
um
New York Post on Elon Musk I didn't see
it
oh yeah maybe
no I I think the trouble is that
marriage is a rental that we don't
acknowledge
I I think people look at the statistics
and they say yeah I'm going to try to be
the one that lasts forever but
realistically it's probably a rental
like it if you got married to thinking
that you were going to be the one who
beat the odds
I would question that uh point of view
uh I should follow Andrew T Tate and go
Muslim
you know wouldn't you love to see a an
honest poll
of Muslim women versus other women to
see who's happier
what do you think that would show
if you did an honest poll I don't know
if you could do it unbiased but if you
could find a way to do it do you think
that Muslim women would be less
happy
I don't know
I do not know
yeah it could go either way I wouldn't
even know how to predict that
yeah Iran's a special case but
all right all right that's all for now
I'm going to talk to you tomorrow
YouTube I'll stay with the locals people
for a little bit
bye for now Spotify and YouTube and
Rumble
