go
well all you need is a copper mug or a
glass attacker Joseph Diana Kentucky
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee enjoy
being now for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopa beat end of the day thing makes
everything better except fill bump is
called the simultaneous set when it
happens now go
now let me test the audience when I say
the name Phil bump
how many of you don't know who I'm
talking about
is there anybody who doesn't know who he
is by today
because he's the Rosetta Stone
that opens up the entire Machinery of
the uh the Democrat
well propaganda machine basically
if you if you don't know who he is just
Google him watch the interview
oh you'll find out
right speaking of things that aren't
working
uh my book
reframe your brain is shown as hardcover
is available to purchase except that it
says they're Anna stock
now what you should know is that I'm
independently published which means that
Amazon prints them as they're ordered
there is no stock
so I'm out of something
that isn't a thing
and that's why you can't buy it but of
course you probably won't buy the soft
cover because it disappears when you're
looking at the hardcover so it looks
like the hardcover is unavailable
but the soft cover isn't even there
so if you watch my my rankings they went
from top 20 to
just sort of disappeared in the last few
days now do you think I can get this
fixed
I don't know
been trying do you think I can get the
six fake books of mine off of there that
are called workbooks but really they're
just pirate books nope there's something
like I think sex
now fake books of mine there are two
fake covers
that you could think you're buying and
you can't there's six fake books that
you can buy that aren't mine they're
just Pirates can't get rid of any of
them
right there's no recourse apparently
there's just nothing you can do about it
other people said they've had similar
problems so I don't know that I'm being
targeted
it just looks exactly like I'm being
targeted that's all I know
so
um there is a new uh Andrew Tate
documentary on BBC which says many bad
things about him let me test your media
knowledge we're not going to talk about
him is not no it's not about him
I'm going to ask you this simple
question then we're done
what kind of credibility should you give
a documentary
about a public figure
zero yeah the the right amount of
credibility would be zero but let me
tell you if you were to watch that thing
you're totally going to believe every
part of it because that's how
documentaries work the the least
reliable form of information maybe in
the entire world would be a documentary
that has a point of view
now if you don't believe me
you want to have your mind bent I've
said this before there are two
documentaries about Michael Jackson that
have been around a long time
one of them says he's a horrible child
abuser the other one says it's all made
up
you could watch either of them
individually and be completely convinced
that the one you watched tells you
everything you need to know
and they're opposites
they're opposites you can watch the one
that says he's guilty as hell and you
will be convinced he's guilty
five minutes later just watch the other
one
you will be convinced it was all made up
what's my opinion I have no idea
I really have no idea I'll tell you I
watched the one where he was
um that where they debunked the claims I
watched that a second
so if you put a gun to my head and said
all right you watch two things that are
you know neither of them are convincing
but you know gun to your head you have
to pick one I would pick the second one
I watched do you know why
because it was the second one I watched
not because it was better not because it
was more true
the the reason that in a trial the
defense gets to go last is that whoever
goes last has a huge advantage
so even though I'm completely aware of
the fact that the only reason I think
the one that debunks the claims is the
true one is because I saw it second
that's it so I'm simultaneously think
it's true
while at the same time know that the
only reason I think is true is an
irrational reason it was the second one
I watched
isn't that amazing how easily we can be
duped
all right
um
so the whole fill bump uh meltdown is
just getting more interesting I I
confess that he was well has been one of
my biggest critics who I call my mascots
for years but he's also been The Pusher
of I I did a little uh Googling to find
out what what else he's been up to now
that we know he's a fraud
uh or at least those are the suggestions
based on his podcast with gnome Dorman
but he was pushing the fine people hoax
like it was real are you surprised are
you surprised as somebody who appears to
be have unmasked as a knowing stooge of
somebody but somebody who wasn't even
trying to do real news apparently
yeah he pushed the fine people hoax uh
and now that would be in the Washington
Post and if I've told you a million
times other other news outlets look for
the Washington Post
or the New York Times or the Wall Street
Journal usually as their signal
that something is real
so he he got in the you know biggest
outlet and signaled it was real and then
everybody jumped on board he was one of
the people signaling
he also pushed the injecting
disinfectant hoax which you would know
as the drinking bleach oats but he
couldn't go so far as to say drinking
bleach because it just wasn't in the
transcript that's something the CNN did
when they don't show you the transcript
but uh but he went for injecting just in
fact then like he meant if a liquid
disinfectant instead of what he was
talking about which was light as a
disinfectant which was being actually in
trial at the time you mentioned it
um so yeah it turns out that the fill
bump is exactly what you thought he was
he is a stooge for somebody who is the
primary maybe maybe the number one
Pusher of political hoaxes in the
country
don't you feel better that you know that
so that whenever you see his work
if you ever see his work again
he's totally backed by his company how
would you like to be the Washington Post
and know that you have to back that guy
because if you don't back them you know
what
it means you know what was happening
they have to act like they were unaware
that anything bad was happening oh no
he's a great writer I don't even know
what you're talking about
that's a very awkward place to be
because surely they know he was just
making up
do you think they didn't know that
do you think his editor was unaware
that he was just making up
I don't know
it's a mystery
well Jody fauci got the full bump of
science award from me today because he
actually was on who is he talking to
um you'll remind me
he was being grilled about the
effectiveness of masks because you know
they're talking about bringing back and
uh well I was a
so once again
can can we give a nod to smirkanish for
not being a CNN stooge I mean he's on
CNN but he seems to be independent and
he might be one of the few
so yeah I mean and think of how hard it
is to be
independently minded on CNN that can't
be easy
he probably gets a little pushback but I
appreciate him and he was fair to me
when I was on the show Once once it was
not fair he uh brought on a Critic to be
there at the same time which is
basically a hit but I'll bet the
producers brought the critic on I bet
that wasn't him
uh so yes I think back I think the
producers probably tried to sandbag me
with the critic but I don't think he
would have done that that sounds like
something they pushed so I do trust
breconish
but anyway he pointed out to fauci that
studies of you know populations show
that mass didn't make any difference
where they were implemented so the ones
who had them and the ones who didn't
have them you know different cities and
locations
um Mr merconich argues that the you know
the best science says it there was no
difference
now fauci argued well you know maybe the
science doesn't show that there's a
difference at a population level
but there's plenty of science that shows
that they work on an individual level
uh
what
so fauci believes
that they totally work individually
but if you take all the people who had
individually worked for and added them
together all the benefit would add to
zero when you measured it because nobody
can find it at a group level
he actually tried to sell that that the
statistics could be true for an
individual but when you added them up
gosh we don't see it but that doesn't
mean anything
can you even believe that is your brain
just going you must be explaining this
wrong Scott I don't think I am I think
I'm explaining it pretty much the way he
did now his argument would be that he
thinks the science about the individuals
is a little more solid
then something about the population but
his reasoning would be at least this is
how I intuited it you know he didn't say
it directly
that because the individual stuff agrees
with them that must be the right one
why would he say if the two are on a
sink the individual studies and then the
group studies are out of sync
why would he pick the group studies what
would be the the logic for that it's
because it agrees on them
what else would it be
I I can't think of any other is it he
didn't offer any other reason
talk about being a film bumped
oh my God mercado's actually Phil bumped
him right out of you know all
conversation but most of the country
wouldn't know the difference
and would think that well if it works on
an individual level that must be proof
it works on a big level I guess they
just got that data on let me remind you
that all information about the pandemic
is non-credible
it doesn't matter if it agrees with you
if you're if you're accepting the
pandemic information that agrees with
your point of view
you're you've missed you've missed the
last five years
there's no reliable data
are you kidding about the pandemic it's
all motivated daily the stuff that
agrees with you is motivated the stuff
that disagrees with you is motivated and
science apparently can't study most
things they just pretend they can to get
funded for it
now well they can study it they just
can't know that they got anything useful
out of it
yeah anyway
I'm old enough to remember because
somebody tried this on me on on X today
they tried to dunk on me by saying that
there's a randomized that the best
the best trial was a randomized
controlled trial
so once you have one of those you're
good to go right
you can ignore all the weak trials
because you got the good high quality
randomized control trial the gold
standard they say
I used to believe that that was a thing
that a randomized controlled trial told
you something that you could trust that
is so not true
it just depends who funded it
who foughted it will pretty much tell
you what the result was do you know why
because if the people who funded it
didn't get the right result I'm not
entirely sure you would ever know what
happened
am I wrong
if the result is opposite of what the
people who funded it or even did the
study wanted it to be do you think that
they would publish it and say wow this
really caught us by surprise
but it's a good thing we know now
they would say it looks like we did this
study wrong there's a flaw in it so
we're going to you know just hold on to
it because there's no point in giving
people flawed data
do you know how many how many studies
would be Beyond reproach like even the
experts could look at it in detail and
say wow the people who did this study
nailed it they they got everything right
probably never
probably never
because if there's any complication
whatsoever people will have different
opinions about what was the better way
to handle that one element of the the
larger trial and they'll be like is your
sample
you know I wouldn't have picked that
sample because of some reason blah blah
blah so if you have one randomized
control trial it's closer to an opinion
or fake news
than it is to true but it could be true
I'd say it's a one in three
I give a randomized control trial if you
only had one of them
if there's only one I'd give it a one in
three chance of being useful
so you should actually bet against them
so there's some some some possibility
that the fix is in and whoever funded it
is you know making it come out one way
and the other possibility is they just
did it wrong and it's a mistake or their
control group was wrong or some damn
thing
probably one in three is my best guess
for a randomized control trial I would
have said nine and a ten
five years ago I would say well they
can't all be right but you know if you
do everything right the gold standard
nine out of ten probably I'd say one out
of three
that's my current best guess
well we're all waiting for the newest
race hoax for 2024 we know it's coming
there might be more than one
so that they might have to roll out like
three or four to see which one catches
on
but there's one they're they're floating
now about a pregnant black woman who was
shot
if you take out the part where she was
trying to kill a police officer when she
got shot
it looks pretty bad if you leave in the
part where she was trying to murder a
police officer with her car then it
looks a little different
and then there's also the uh the very
well addressed and well-equipped uh new
set of Nazis turns out there's a whole
new set of Nazis they've got nice red
shirts
they've got their you know matching Hood
so you can't see their faces and they've
got these brand new Nazi flags with
actually swastikas on them and there's
some video of them so it must be true am
I right there's video of them
I saw it with my own eyes uh don't tell
me that it's fake I saw it with my own
eyes and if there's one thing we know
for sure if I saw it with my own eyes
that's better than a randomized
controlled trial am I right no because
most of the hoaxes
people saw with their own eyes
do you know how you feel a fool a
scientists
does anybody know how to fool a
scientist
yeah you all do because it's the easiest
thing in the world there's nothing
easier than fooling a scientist I saw
one today who believed one of the hoaxes
and it was literally literally teaches
science and yet he believed one of the
major hoaxes do you know why he was easy
to fool as I mentioned to him
because a scientist doesn't know
all the ways that people are evil
if you're a scientist and you work with
other scientists who are actually just
trying to figure out what's true you
kind of imagine that other people are
like that too
it would be hard for you to imagine that
somebody would even intend
a study to be fake if you're a real
scientist you would even that wouldn't
even be in your mental model that
somebody would fake or study until you
know intentionally you'd be thinking
well some studies might make mistakes
but you would never ever think
somebody funded a whole study just as a
fraud
which I'm pretty sure is routine
actually
routine in the sense that if they get
the right answer they'll keep it if they
get the wrong answer they'll throw it
away and say it was flawed right so in
effect they're just buying an answer
so
um I think it could be that this new
group is that you know we'll see more of
them and then they'll become the new
fine people hoax they'll wait for
somebody like Trump to say something
that can be taken out of context so it
looks like he's supporting them you know
he'll say some something like
who knows but you could imagine it being
taken in a concert here's my guess about
that group probably mostly real racists
probably mostly real racist the second
part of my prediction is this hold on
that they only existed as a bunch of
online people chatting about stuff they
agreed with
until
some well-dressed new person or persons
came into the group and suggested that
they should take their act into the
public you know this chatting isn't
nearly enough you know what you guys
need
you need some nice shirts if you love me
I'll order them for you if you could
give me all your sizes I'll make sure
you get all the shirts and while we're
at it you know it doesn't cost much more
money why don't we get some Flags
don't you think you'd feel better if you
had a flag if you're out in public with
your nice shirt yeah yeah and make sure
you've got some you know face coverings
and then I'll do some project management
for you and we'll pick a time we'll
organize everybody make sure everybody
has transportation and then we'll make
sure we've got a nice public show
do you know what kind of people are good
project managers in the context of
racist organizations
apparently the FBI
apparently the feds right those
undercover people are really good at
organizing
so I don't know the truth of this group
I assume that they're real racists
but I think that their unusual level of
organization and fashion
suggests they have a project manager if
you know what I mean
somebody's making them a little bit more
organized than you would expect this
group to be
yeah it looks it looks like it's a op
and maybe it'll get bigger we'll see
but there will definitely be a race Oaks
in 2024 and I've already come up with a
hashtag before that the hoax itself
so when the hoax arises and we all
recognize it we'll do hashtag race
hoax2024.
so I want to get it going before the
actual hoax because I feel like
it would help convince Democrats that
they've been brainwashed if you can call
the if you can call the hip before it
happens you know if you can point to the
the fence you're going to hit it over
I'm going to hit it over the left field
fence it's going to be a race hoax it's
going to happen in 2024 and uh just wait
for it
I mean it's almost guaranteed
[Applause]
is there anybody think so it won't be a
race house hoax
there's nobody who thinks there won't be
one right
of course there will and you notice that
they all they all kind of stopped under
uh Biden
like all the race hoaxes you know it's
funny that no police officer
shot an unarmed black man or killed an
unarmed black man during the entire
Biden Administration so far
don't you love how Biden completely
stopped that problem just by existing as
a cadaver
very effective yeah it's almost as if
those things were I don't know not
exactly what you think
so once again uh the I saw it with my
own eyes crowd or weighing in to my list
of political hoaxes when they see it
they always say the same thing but I saw
it with my own eyes and they're the
easiest to fool
because that's how all magic tricks work
you think you saw it with your own eyes
it's how all hoaxes work
you thought yourself something real
so they actually argue that it's not a
hoax because they saw something they
believed
I feel like they don't know what a hoax
is
a hoax is something that looks exactly
like is real
but it's not
and so their argument that it's not a
hoax is that it looks exactly real to
them
not really understanding the whole hoax
concept
that not knowing as a hoax is really
integral to the hoax
if you knew it was a hoax because you
could just look at it yourself
wouldn't be so effective as a hoax
well anyway
so I do so my Approach with the I saw it
with my own eyes people is pity then
point
pity then point so I express my my
sympathy that this has happened to them
and I always say I'm sorry this happened
to you
which is a very powerful phrase because
you know what nobody wants in the
context of an argument
sympathy
because it's out of frame
do you understand that if you enter the
frame of I've got some claims I have
some counter claims we are now debating
the claims versus the counter claims
well you can't win that
but you might be able to make them feel
embarrassed
through your empathy
that I actually and by the way the
empathy is real in my case when I see
somebody saying stuff like this there's
clearly just brainwashing result
I actually just feel sorry for them
imagine going through life thinking that
this stuff really happened
imagine living in America thinking that
the president praised Nazis on
television
imagine thinking that actually happened
in the real world
I saw it with my own eyes Scott I heard
it with my own ears no you didn't that's
how the hoax works you saw things that
you thought were that because they took
out the context
they the bad people
anyways who's approved just
but you can just Google any of them in
the debunks and you'll see how they did
it to you
um George soros's son Alex
I was reading a Glenn greenwald's tweet
he's issued a I don't know Glenn called
it a Manifesto on his foreign policy but
basically it was a statement that he's
going to keep doing George Soros types
of things
and
as Greenwald s and I think it's a good
question is at what point did our
political system allow one billionaire
to tell you how he's going to change the
system and then do it right in front of
you
which part of the which part of the
Constitution was rich guy will spray
money in the direction of getting shitty
wants he's telling you he's doing it and
I do appreciate that by the way I do
appreciate transparency so I'm going to
give Alex
you know a plus for that part of his
transparency
so and it is he does have free speech
correct me if I'm wrong he's an American
citizen right
I actually I don't know that that's true
is he an American citizen
uh I think he is right
pretty sure
I think he is yeah so all right we have
a confirmation right so as an American
citizen he is innocently proven guilty
not that I'm accusing him of anything
illegal
um and he has free speech
free speech
areas apparently the legal Avenues to
donate money to causes he cares about
including politicians
so
uh
but why is it okay
I get that it's legal
it seems totally legal
but why is it okay
I feel like you should be embarrassing
to say that you're going to use your
money to buy us our system
yeah because if you can't do with
argument
should it be done
I suppose there are some things that
couldn't happen without money but
you don't think that a good argument
could
get you to a better place than money
because as soon as money's involved
people are going to look to how to steal
your money and you know just keep
stealing it it becomes a different
objective when money's involved
well I would say it's a sketchy but
legal
and uh
there's something wrong with the system
where we can't fire him
am I right
like you you know in our normal elected
system if somebody does a bad job at
least there's some chance they could get
voted out of office but he's like a
he's like a shadow government
and the amazing thing is he he's telling
you he's telling you how he's trying to
influence policy
but I guess it's not illegal
maybe it should be
maybe you should be I don't know I don't
know how you could make it illegal and
not make too many other things illegal
but uh this this is not a sustainable
situation
it would be interesting if some other
billionaire
decided to fund whatever was the
opposite of everything Alex funds
imagine this just you know for fun this
is not going to happen but imagine uh
Elon Musk or somebody like that saying
I'm going to double the funding of
whatever you do to whatever is the
anti-group for the group you funded so
if you're funding prosecutors who want
to let people out of jail I will double
what you give to their competition wants
to keep them in jail and you just double
his you double all of his uh
his Investments for one year
if you weren't there at all it would be
more like a fair fight
but if he's going to donate a dollar you
give the other side two dollars and you
never stop doing it
now if he tried to match you like you
know up his it would be sort of a
ridiculous use of money and it would
just look stupid and everybody would
just laugh at both of the billionaires
for wasting the money
but it would make his whole deal look
stupid and a waste of time
right now presumably he wakes up I'm
just guessing because I can't read minds
but wouldn't you say he's probably a
True Believer
or do some of you think he's secretly
trying to destroy the world because his
father
something something
I feel like he's a True Believer
like all the signs are that he's he
believes that he's got a better vision
for things
yeah
but don't you think that motivates him
like you feel like you're doing
something good so you wake up and say
I'm gonna give some money to good things
today
but suppose you knew that every time you
gave a dollar it doubled the competition
to your idea
would you still wake up and want to do
that job
how many days would you wake up and make
your own causes worse off because
there's another billionaire who's going
to counter counter program You by double
I know I feel like you could discourage
him out of the business with you know
vast amounts of money in a way that you
couldn't talk him out of it
you know at least just the stuff that
needs to be talked to Anna
all right I'd love to deprogram him in
public but you he would never talk to me
I assume
all right so if you didn't already doubt
science just think of these things
science failed during the pandemic I
would say completely nutrition failed
you know the the experts have been lying
to us about nutrition forever
climate predictions
um
have not materialized the dire ones
String Theory I was just mocking that on
X yesterday
string theory is so ridiculous the the
idea is that
you know there's stuff you can see
particles and atoms and electrons and if
you burrow down to what stuff is made of
and then what that stuff is made of and
you get to what a what a quark or a
charm is made of you know the smallest
elements of reality uh then the the
scientists are telling us that they're
made with some kind of vibrating string
of something and the type of vibration
determines what kind of a particle it it
is
but isn't there a missing question
what is the string made of
and somebody said energy
what's energy made of it it does energy
exist if there's no matter
if the universe had no matter
could have energy
because energy is the movement of matter
isn't it
no we can't it would be logically
impossible in an empty Universe to have
energy
you to have only energy
because energy doesn't exist except in
the content context of things moving and
there would be nothing to move
so so basically at the bottom of it all
is nothing
if it's Just Energy it's literally
nothing
yeah the whole idea and and by the way I
guess the string theory does it hasn't
panned down hasn't explained everything
you know huge amounts of money have gone
into it just like some of these other
things and it looks like it was just a
money suck and it never really had any
possibility of doing anything
so uh
yeah Eric Weinstein's been saying this
for a long time he says it better
because he understands the field whereas
I'm just looking at from the outside
I imagine imagine
the arrogance of what I'm doing right
now
if I well I have said this but 10 years
ago when I said this and I think I was
saying it 10 years ago the string theory
looked ridiculous
you would have just laughed at me right
oh let me check your resume uh Scott I'm
looking for your science accreditations
I don't see any it appears that you
don't have any sciencey background so
why don't you just listen to The Experts
right ten years ago that's that's the
treatment I would have gotten
how does it feel after the pandemic
after the pilot pandemic when I say uh
they've been working on it for 50 years
and produced basically nothing
probably just a hoax that is a big money
money spigot
does that sound crazy today
not so crazy huh see if you wait long
enough I become less crazy over time
it's a weird phenomenon I start out bad
 crazy
and then I become more normal over time
you want to hear another one
do you remember a certain thing I got in
trouble for and canceled worldwide
I should I said you should get the hell
away from a certain group of people
did you take that as something racial
I expressed it that way but is that how
you took it
because here's here's some of the
context that of course gets lost by the
full bumps of the world did Phil bump
write about me he probably did I don't
know he tweeted about it
um
but but here's the argument
if there's a segment of the population
it doesn't matter who they are if
there's a segment of the population that
has been trained to believe that you
have their stuff and they need to get it
back
you should go as far away from them as
you can
nobody disagrees with that it has
nothing to do with your DNA it has to do
with the fact that our current
environment with CRT training and Dei
and companies and ESG you know above it
all they all have in common that there's
a victim class and a patriarchy kind of
class that are the oppressors and that
the oppressors have your stuff
and you better get it back
if you find yourself in that environment
get the out of there
now the fact that I used the most
provocative shorthand for it
I don't apologize for it at all because
I was trying to make people really
really mad
so that eventually when they calm down
they could hear me say this
Black America if you didn't know it CRT
ESG and Dei have poisons your
relationship with white especially male
Americans and it's not going to get
fixed
you've poisoned the relationship forever
anybody who sticks around people who
think that you've got their stuff and
you should give it back legally or
possibly if I have to shoplift it you
need to get as far away from those
people no matter what their DNA is they
can be white
they could be the white people who
believe that Equity is is the way to go
and that the people who are shoplifting
maybe shouldn't be arrested
because after all well it's balancing
the equity a little bit isn't it you
should get a far away get the away
from any white person who thinks that
you've got somebody else's stuff
that's no good for you
and let me say again the thing that
every black man will agree with man
every black man will agree with
women I don't know I have less less
insight there
is only every black man will agree with
number one you we should not
discriminate in employment
right everybody agrees
number two
should not discriminate in making let's
say loans
absolutely not no tolerance
number three we should not discriminate
an individual relationships not who you
date Not Who Your Friends Are
not who you marry not who you have kids
with those are not proper domains that
anybody reasonable wants discrimination
however if you find yourself in the
situation where the topic is not let's
say some of those things that I
mentioned and is literally your
self-defense
if it's your self-defense you can
discriminate as much as you want
there's no rules about that
right if you're if you're physically
threatened or somebody's tried to rob
you for example
you don't have to worry about feelings
there's nobody feel that nobody's
feelings you have to worry about you
don't have to worry about precedence
you don't even have to worry about the
law except not getting caught
right none of it matters for
self-defense you just do what you need
to do to stay safe and keep your family
safe
so
anybody who's operating on the process
of keeping themselves and their family
safe they could discriminate all they
want I'll give you an example if you're
a a black man let's say you're married
and you want to get a babysitter for the
kids
would you pick a 40 year old single
white guy as your babysitter
would you or would you discriminate
because that looks like trouble
well if this were like if this were more
like an employment situation and I guess
it is it is actually employment but no
sane person
would ignore what they imagined to be
the risks
when it comes to your safety or your
family's safety you are absolutely
allowed
to use your imagination of what keeps
you safer you could be wrong you could
be just a terrible you know
discriminator
but you have every right to protect
yourself as you see fit that's not
illegal
it's just not illegal at all and if it
were illegal you should ignore that law
because that would be a dumbass law
so
what what black person would disagree
with anything I just said they would
definitely disagree with the provocative
way I said it but even I disagree with
myself on that because it was just to
get attention right it wasn't it wasn't
you know how do you actually separate
but I think the important part of the
story is
that black Americans need to understand
they're just poisoning their
relationship and white people won't tell
you because they would get canceled
so I decided to tell you
if you're black and you're watching this
you don't think it's useful to know that
white America wants to get away from you
even if they don't say it out loud
because they don't want to get sued they
don't want to be competing against you
for jobs because they can't
and they don't want to be anywhere where
there's no bail and massive shoplifting
they might not say it
but they're all thinking the same thing
now does all of the CRT EST di stuff
doesn't give you some immediate benefits
probably
does maybe some more people get a little
opportunities but
you should always weigh whatever benefit
you're getting
with the costs
and if nobody's going to tell you that
you've completely poisoned White America
so that we actually feel that it's
dangerous to be in an environment with
people who think that you have their
stuff and they need to get it back
to reach equity
you don't want to be around that
if there's any way you can get away from
an environment
where people's brains have been poisoned
not their DNA nothing is about DNA we're
about some natural thing in anybody it's
just that the Mind virus has you know
focused on a certain group of people
not exclusively
but mostly
so
do I sound as crazy as I sounded the
first time you heard it
so my my thesis here is that I sound
less crazy as time goes by just in
general
generally speaking Yeah
now I'd also one of one of the things I
pointed out
is that my audience is unique and a big
big mistake I made was not realizing
that anything I say can get into the
larger audience and the larger audience
has no idea what's going on with me
because they don't have any context so
they just figure I'm just one of those
crazy racists
when in fact
I probably was the most useful person to
Black America of anybody this year
that's my claim the most useful person
because they didn't know this
did they do you think there were any
black Americans were who knew they had
poisoned their relationship with white
America and it doesn't look like there's
a fix and that white America is going to
do everything they can to stay away from
that risk it's a it's a risk that's
Extreme has cost me so far two jobs and
one one well four jobs actually all four
of my jobs were because I'm white
so I lost
my banking career because my boss said
you can't promote white guys
true story
black people think that didn't happen
they think there's no way it was
probably just because you were a bad
employee there's no way that your boss
told you directly
we can't promote you because you're
white and male
and if you think that's the case that
I'm making this up I would give you as
my witness 100 percent of white men who
have had any experience in the corporate
world
everyone
you can ask every single one and now you
might ask yourself but why are they
quiet
isn't that obvious
I was canceled worldwide for simply
telling my actual experience and and my
actual opinion which was not meant to be
harmful to anybody
so white people have been trained to
just keep their heads down and try to
make the best of it
but that's the reason you didn't know
so the most useful person is the person
who tells you the truth that you weren't
aware of
it's just that that person is going to
take a spear in the back for doing it
but if it's worth it
I just thought it was worth it I just
felt that the truth
or let's say the additional information
was so useful
that you needed you needed to stop the
trade with a little bit of a you know
truth bomb
so that's what I tried to do
we'll see how that goes
and that ladies and gentlemen is all I
had prepared because it's a slow news
day was there some
um
story or anything that uh
that
you want to talk about that I haven't
talked about
why don't you apologize for pushing the
Ukraine war the first year you felt it
was a good side and we had to help no
Jill that would be you being an idiot
Jill has asked me to apologize for
pushing the Ukraine war
did anybody remember me pushing a war
nope no I've never pushed a war
I actually I pushed in the war with the
cartels but that's the only one uh you
you fell for the hoax that Ukraine was
on the good side did I did I was I tell
you that Ukraine was the good ones nope
nope opposite
so Jill where are you getting your
information
is it from your own
all right
uh I made predictions that were one was
the worst
and then all the rest were the best
I predicted Ukraine would win nope did
not
did not
let me ask the others did I predict that
Ukraine would win
those of you who say yes to you why are
all the other people saying no
no you imagined that I did
let me let me tell you what I did
predict
I predicted incorrectly
this is this is my worst prediction
that Putin would be crazy to invade
because the resistance would be far more
than he could than anybody's guessing
and then he attacked
so who was right was Scott Wright that
it would be way worse than Putin
imagined I was that was but I was
completely wrong that he would know that
too I thought he would know it too
barely he didn't
secondly I said that Ukraine would not
be uh
easily conquerable because they would
have modern weapons especially the
things that fly through the air that
maybe the Russians haven't seen yet that
would be drones and missiles and stuff
and what is it that's keeping Ukraine
safe so far a lot of that plus modern
weapon a plus you know they've got a lot
of fight in them apparently
so I would say I had the best
the best prediction about Ukraine's
ultimate
fighting ability I've also said
that you can't predict the final outcome
because on both sides there could be
some key collapse point
in other words you could imagine that
it'd be something that would collapse
the Russian military let's say a supply
line problem or something like that and
you can imagine that to be something
that would collapse the Ukrainian side
similarly supplies or maybe a lack of
manpower
but we don't know which what collapse is
going to come first so I've never
predicted that Ukraine would conquer
Russia
I predicted a unusually
stiff resistance because of modern
technology and then the home court they
had the home court advantage
so
there are two categories in which I have
the best predictions
which the Which social media has
reversed my predictions to imagine that
they were the worst
yeah it looks like Ukraine might run out
of people before Russia runs out of
money or willpower or anything else
why is the only state where racism is
allowed by law is that a thing
oh uh yeah in terms of the look well
that's not true
because anywhere there's an Indian
Reservation or a Native American
reservation
they have different laws there so that's
a form of discrimination
maybe not it might not be bad but it's a
form of discrimination
how do you feel about Maui being covered
in Black tarps I don't think that's a
thing
Catherine Austin Fitz don't know
anything about her
um
Nazi feds we talked about them
uh what's happening in burning man I
don't care does anybody care about
what's happening at Burning Man
nobody cares about that
um
U.S U.S troops I don't think U.S troops
are going to fight Russia does anybody
think that's going to happen
does anybody believe that
you do
you think U.S troops are going to fight
Russia
more more than are already there because
presumably there's a lot of a lot of
advisors there
yeah I would bet against it now I bet
against Putin invading Ukraine so you
should you should put that in your uh
in your negatives for my predictions
about war
in my opinion there's no chance of
American boots on the ground you know
like in actual tropes just advisors and
maybe some special forces or something
but they'll try to look like they're not
there
um well I think we've learned I think
we've learned something haven't we could
you imagine well let me ask you this
question if Biden put troops in the
ground and before the 2024 election
sorry
if Biden were to put American troops in
the war prior to the 2024 election you
think he could win
I don't see any way you could win
putting troops on the ground
no way
no way yeah so given that Biden knows
that and anybody who took his place
would know it as well
who exactly is going to be in favor of
the war
so yeah
I mean the neocons but it would be
political political disaster
tobacco War at this point I can't even
think of anything worse
is there anything that would more
guarantee the election goes in one
direction there's nothing that would
more guarantee that a republican would
be elected
well nothing's impossible nothing's
impossible but it would be political
suicide now that's exactly where I got
it wrong with Putin
I said if Putin invaded Ukraine it would
be you know political suicide
and it kind of was you know he didn't he
didn't die so it looks like he'd
probably recover fully but I'm saying
the same thing about Biden but what if
he's not in charge what if the
military-industrial complex
is calling the shots
in that case there wouldn't be boots on
the ground I suppose
have you figured out the brilliant thing
that the military industrial complex did
with the Ukraine
it's the smartest thing I've ever seen I
was thinking about it yesterday right
let's say you're the your military
industrial complex and you're trying to
sell weapons to the United States you
know you're a big buyer hey do you want
to buy some more bullets
and they say we've got so many bullets
we got all kinds of bullets
then you say but you know some of them
might be getting older you should
replace the older bullets with new
bullets
and then they say ah I see what you're
saying you know I get it but we have a
lot of other uses for this money
and replacing our bullets that may be
getting older it's it's not really at
the top of our list because there's no
active War
and then the Ukraine war starts and we
start giving away our all our old stuff
you don't think we're gonna have to
backfill that by buying new stuff from
the people who are back in the war
it's kind of brilliant the the business
model this is insanely good in an evil
way of course
uh
bite the bullet
why do I think the war is continuing
because nobody knows how to stop it
everything continues until there's a
counter force and there isn't the
counter Force
uh don Steele says but troops on Mexico
ground is good per Scott
have I ever told you about reasoning
with analogy that that's how you can
spot an NPC and NPC will say you
shouldn't do this war
because something something about
another War
as soon as somebody says that you can
discount everything they say after that
there are no similar Wars
there are no two Wars that are same
the reasons of one don't apply to the
other one it doesn't work that way
they're just never the same history
doesn't repeat it can't because you're
always at a different starting place
uh
oh my God you just tried to order my
paper book back
and you got issued a refund for damaged
or undeliverable
in spite of all the other ones that go
just fine do you know how easy it is to
ship a book have you ever seen the
package that a book comes in
the book comes in like this this package
that like seals the book
like hard in between the cardboard so
you have to like pry it open
how does a book get damaged a paperback
this weighs nothing
imagine this between two really thick
pieces of cardboard
how does that get damaged
how in the world does that get damaged
there's a lot of coincidences isn't
there or aren't there
uh water yeah I suppose I think you
would have said water but that's a good
point
could have been water I suppose
all right
um or unreliable yes all reporting about
Ukraine is unreliable
well that's true when 100 of the uh
signals point to a total collapse of
Russia you might want to start paying
attention
do you disagree why would you disagree
with it I I swear the weirdest thing
about arguing online is that people will
show links and quotes that support your
argument and they'll think it supports
theirs
it's the oddest thing
all right uh building the wall is framed
I don't know about that
um
his son under the bus what's that
Trump through his through oath through
his son under the bus I don't know about
that
Krugman does the same thing
Elon marks yeah Elon musk's daughter
transitioned
I guess that's true
yeah well was it I don't I don't want to
put a gender but one of his children
transitioned I don't know which
direction it was
um
can you explain why replacement is
better than a demographic crash
well no I'm not going to re respond to a
replacement question
you're gonna have to phrase that
differently
aren't many reframes analogies I don't
know give me an example
I can't think of one
um you know like
oh McConnell replacement by a Democrat
Governor yeah I I saw a headline about
that so isn't it according to the
constant is there a law that says that
the governor has to replace the senator
with somebody in the same party
it's state law
I wonder why it should be it feels like
you shouldn't be a state law
Kentucky says that
depends on the state so the Kentucky
Governor is saying he might not
necessarily replace with the same party
has to submit three names and then he
chooses from the name somebody says
well we'll see
the governor is calling it
unconstitutional to say that they can do
that
you said you wanted somebody's saying
you said you wanted Ukraine to win in
the beginning of this conflict would you
not agree
can can you show me me saying that
I don't have any memory of saying that
why am I just defending people's literal
hallucinations about things I've said I
don't believe I've ever said that
all right well it doesn't sound like
something I thought so I don't know if
you thought you saw something like that
the I can't explain that
uh bricks and the gold standard I don't
really talk about that because nobody
knows anything about that
nobody knows anything smart about that
all right
Illusions are necessary doctor that is
correct
uh Chuck Schumer is promoting
replacement Theory and Scott literally
won't touch the subject no I'm I'm only
objecting to the word
the use of the term because the term is
a racist red flag
replacement Theory
if you say we have a population problem
which is somewhat mitigated by
immigration
then I've said that how many times have
I said that I say it clearly and often
that we would that probably the United
States Secret Weapon would be that we're
better at immigration now at the moment
we're not doing it right because we're
letting all comers in that's completely
wrong but if you were doing it wisely
the Vivek way and you were making
America the place where the the smartest
and best and most educated people come
from everywhere
you would have a superpower that would
actually be better than growing your own
at least economically you know you might
argue that has a has a social
risks you don't like but that's a
different argument
why why would you say I wouldn't touch
that the only thing I wouldn't touch is
your racist sounding word
why would you use a racist word when you
don't need to like why would you
identify yourself as a racist by using
replacement Theory when you could just
say we don't make a lot of babies so we
should bring in lots of good immigrants
that benefit the country
or argue against it but you don't need
this replacement Theory thing because
the replacement Theory imagines that
that's the real plan the plan is to make
us more Brown and I'm sure there's some
people who want that
they're probably plenty of citizens who
want it but it's not some master plan
that's being organized from the top
you mind culture change well you know
the good news is that the Hispanic
migration is more American than we are
I hate to tell you have you spent any
time with anybody from South of the
Border who grew up there
they're not exactly liberals they're
very family oriented they're very
religious
their hard work you know first
they largely like to stay out of trouble
you know there's obviously there's a
gang element but your average Hispanic
immigrant
has every quality you'd want an American
that we've lost
if you want to renew the American kind
of ideals
there's a whole bunch of it South of the
Border there's not much of it left here
that we're growing natively
right so you might have to bring in some
American ideals from other countries
because that they still think that
America has you know a set of qualities
that it sort of lost so they're bringing
in that point of view it's like oh let
me join this team that has these great
qualities
and then they find out maybe it's not
quite what they thought it was but at
least they brought their good attitude
here that's got to help
um I saw that Nikki Haley was a head of
Vivek in the polls
in in one pole do you think that's real
it might be real
because I think the woman vote
um
basically I heard men say they liked
Vivek and I heard women say they liked
Nikki Haley after the first debate did
anybody else hear that
men said Vivek women said Nikki Haley
so probably the men who liked the vague
are probably also like Trump so that's
where their vote went but the the women
who liked Nikki Haley
were a little easier to dislodge from
wherever else there may have been
because you know the woman thing
the woman thing attracts votes and I'm
not even saying you shouldn't if I were
a woman
and there had never been a woman
president
I think I would be just like most people
I'd say well we need one
you know same thing I said about Barack
Obama
it wasn't so much
that he was black it was let's just get
this over with let's do this to show
that we are able to do this like
American can have a black president and
all we'll care about is how good the job
is now that didn't happen we got a black
president and the right flipped out and
and a lot of bad things happened after
that but in theory it could have worked
out it just didn't
all right
um
all right uh
I was on his jock
the the the the lowest level of comments
uh would be uh you want to date him
or he was on his jock or get your mouth
away from his penis the the those those
are the people who don't know how
anything works
but they still want to participate
they're the ones who say it's not fair
but what about fairness ah fairness the
concept that was invented so that idiots
and children can participate in
conversations
and thank goodness we have personal
insults so that the worst Among Us can
be full participants in the political
back and forth
well I think tax rates should be higher
no I think tax rate should be lower and
then the other person comes in
you look like a thumb
all right valuable contribution to the
conversation thank you
thank you I do look like a thumb but
that's a completely different
conversation
all right I think we've done enough for
today because it's a three-day weekend
and nobody wants to think about
any kind of stuff like that
use one false part that discredited an
actual atrocity
so kenzora says that I rupard myself
with a Canadian Indian story use one
false part that discredited an actual
atrocity well the only thing I said was
that it was a hoax that there were
babies in a mass grave
did you hear me therefore debunk the
entire history of of indigenous people
in Canada did you hear that
in your like weird little
all of this roll rolling around in your
skull
something like that came in and sounded
like that no I don't I don't believe I
don't believe that happened
but your imagination is very vigorous
all right
uh do you know that Akira the Don has a
song that uses a reframe good from Jocko
I did not
laughs
all right that's all for today
uh YouTube
thanks for joining if you can find a way
to buy my book reframe your brain it's
changing people everywhere it's really
amazing best thing I've ever done
by far and I'll talk to you tomorrow
