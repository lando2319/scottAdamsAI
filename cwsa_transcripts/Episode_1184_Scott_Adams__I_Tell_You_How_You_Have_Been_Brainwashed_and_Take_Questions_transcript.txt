hey everybody
come on in here
yeah it's time
it's time
for coffee with scott adams the best
part of the day there will be other good
parts today
don't worry this won't be the only good
part
but let me tell you
this part
pretty darn good and all you need is a
copper mugger glass a tanker chelsea
steiner can't detect a flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i'm partial to coffee
and join me now for the dopamine of the
day
the unparalleled pleasure the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and if you're prepared
it's going to happen to you right now
go
thanks for asking yes i believe that
today's
broadcast
will feature me wearing a shirt the
right way out for the first time yeah
i'll try anything once
and
there are lots of things happening
including i asked on twitter if you
didn't see it
to give me some questions
and
uh why in the world
do those questions oh there we go so
i've already got
645 questions
we might be here for a while
you'd like to hear them all answered
don't you
all right well let me talk about some
fun things first
number one
there is some talk
that if
and it's a very big if
president trump
decides to concede
that he would run again in 2024
now here's the funny part
if you were worried about donald trump
before
and you were a democrat
and you said man
i can't think of anything that was worse
than 2016 to 2020
when president trump was the leader of
the country
what could be worse than that
say the democrats
well
how would you like the resurrection
version of trump
after he's politically dead for four
years and he returns
i think he's going to be stronger
so
i just find it funny to think
that anybody would think that if he
doesn't win this time you're out of the
woods
you're so not out of the woods
and and of course there's still the
recount to go
my uh
my state
continues
to excel
i don't like to brag
i know you've you you live in different
places and
you probably think your state is pretty
good too
but i live in california and let me tell
you
this state does one thing better than
i've ever seen it done
and that is
that one thing that california does
better than any other state and i'm
serious about this is that we can act
like stupid idiots
better
than any state
have you ever seen like
pick some small state rhode island
have you ever seen rhode island try to
act stupid
it's just kind of cute right
that
it's a little rhode island they try to
act stupid but they can't do it they
can't really pull it off they're just
too cute new hampshire
truck
try to be stupid new hampshire you could
try
good luck
you can't do it
top this this is what my state did
this is my state
we uh california or actually san
francisco
banned natural gas and new construction
bam
come on rhode island vermont
do you think you can do something
stupider than that i don't think you can
try it
try it
we're number one we're number one
nobody can be as dumb
as san francisco first and then possibly
fingers crossed this will sweep the rest
of the state
and pretty soon you won't have anything
in your
energy portfolio that is good for global
warming
okay i guess they think they have a plan
there
but as the all of you know the reason
that we've done better than the paris
peace accords had even told us we should
do
is because of
what what was it
fracking
fracking is what gives you natural gas
natural gas is what gives you energy
that's cleaner than coal
and
that's the one that gets replaced
so you don't replace your clean your
clean versions of energy just because
you have natural gas you're not going to
get rid of your
um
you know your solar power and your your
hydro power
those will stay the only thing you're
going to replace is coal because it's
the
the dirty one ish relatively speaking
and
so as all of my
followers know getting rid of natural
gas is exactly the opposite
of what the people doing it want to
achieve
because it will make the climate warmer
as far as we know because we don't have
a
we don't have something that's cleaner
than natural gas that's also as
plentiful
all right
i'm having a good time with this
transition period
far more than i thought i would enjoy it
somebody says this is the dumbest scope
ever
well it might be but it's your last one
there put you out of your pain
you'll never have to worry again
about the dumbness of this periscope
problem solved
problem solved
all right so here's what i'm enjoying
about this transition period
make no mistake about it my first choice
was for president trump to win outright
in the original vote
for reelection
that didn't happen
i unlike some of you have already
congratulated publicly
alleged unverified presumptive
possibly who knows what
president-elect biden
and i was very sincere about it
but nonetheless
nonetheless we do have this
lingering doubt
that
every single thing has been examined
to be sure
100 sure
that we have the right outcome and we're
going to get the right
president-elect
and i didn't think that this uh weird
gray area period
possibly
a period of
uh great chaos i didn't think i would
enjoy it as much as i am and here's the
part that i'm enjoying
and i can't be
i can't feel good about this
i mean i really can't feel good about
this but
i keep imagining in my head the
democrats are having two thoughts
simultaneously
the first thought they're having and
correct me if i'm wrong don't you think
democrats are having
this thought
they're thinking that there's no way the
election had enough fraud
to overturn the results
don't you think that
basically
every democrat is having that thought
because they've been told that the media
has told them unambiguously they said
yeah you know there might be
some little thing here or some little
thing there but there's no way there's
no way there's enough of it
that is going to reverse the decision
and we're talking about tens of
thousands of votes in some of these
states
there's nothing
there's nothing so big
in terms of you know possible uh
election mischief and crime and fraud
there's no way it could be that big
now
would you agree with me first of all
that that is pretty close to probably
the universal thought among the
democrats right now are we on the same
page
that they all pretty much think
nothing's going to be found that's big
enough
yeah yeah yeah you're going to find some
little stuff
but nothing big enough to reverse the
decision
all right so keep that in your head
that they're definitely thinking that
here's the second thing
that in my opinion i can't know what
anybody's thinking but in my opinion
there's a second thing they're thinking
simultaneously and it goes like this
wait
republicans are actually checking
oh
tell me i'm wrong
tell me that the democrats are not
simultaneously thinking there's no way
they're going to find enough
tens of thousands of
you know illegal votes or some kind of
shenanigans there's no way
you
you trump supporters are silly
i laugh at you
but i can't even get the smile off my
face i laugh at you because you're so
dumb
you're so conspiratorial you're so crazy
that you think if you look into this
you're gonna find
tens of thousands
of votes that aren't legitimate
the other thought i'm having
oh
are they actually checking
and i would like to put one additional
thought into your head if you're a
democrat who's
still suffering from ptsd
and i believe you will be
if you're suffering from ptsd
and this is no joke
are you rational
no that's what the psd ptsd is doing to
you it's making you a little less
rational
so if
if they're already a little jumpy
but their their rational brain is saying
look rational brain
come on rational brain the election's
over
there are way too many votes every
recount in the past got a few hundred
binds ahead by thousands and thousands
there's no risk there's no risk here
and then the
ptsd part of their brains
is saying i know there's no risk
and every credible source has told me
that's true
but
it's also true that every credible
source has been wrong
this year
every one of them
name a credible source
that has been accurate and honest
this year let's say within the last 12
months
fbi
how about the fbi
credible
not so much anymore right
how about the news the news business
credible
no
no not credible but wait
our election system
that's credible sure you don't trust the
fbi
so maybe there's some stuff going on
there and you don't trust
the department of justice i get that i
get that there was some trouble over
there
but you know
you could trust the election
and
surely
just because the entire news business is
corrupt
that's that's the news business
that's not the elections
the elections are separate so they're
fine
yeah the fbi is corrupt and we can't
trust them the department of justice is
a little iffy
politics of course we've never trusted
our politicians but you know again these
are different
we're talking about different things now
of course you have your your colleges
and your universities you can trust them
right
because your colleges and your
universities would not use that
opportunity to simply
brainwash
students who were paying to be there
would they
oh that's right
they do
they actually take your money in college
give you a terrible product and
brainwash you while you're there
okay so you can't really trust
your colleges and your universities i
get that but you know isolated incident
well isolated
with the fbi and the department of
justice and politics and fake news so
there are a few institutions
which have not been ideal
citizens wouldn't you say
but still
at least you have a private industry
that you can trust
what
okay okay you don't trust
big private industry but
at least you have the military
industrial complex you can trust
oh wait a minute that name only exists
to describe how you can't trust the
military or industry because they
collude okay okay so you can't exactly
trust the military-industrial complex
you can't trust politicians you can't
trust the news department of justice
fbi
but you know what you can trust the
election
because unlike
every other institution
it seems to be the only one you could
trust
well that's not true there's one other
you can trust
for example you could trust
the supreme court
couldn't you
oh wait i'm sorry
the supreme court only votes the way
it has been packed
so if it's packed with conservatives you
expected to
just give you what you want if you're
conservative if it happened to be packed
with liberals
you would just
expect to give you what liberals wanted
so that's not really a court at all is
it
what kind of a core is it if you know
what the answer is before you give it
give them the question
so all right so you don't trust the
court or politics or
the news or the military industrial
complex or the department of justice or
the fbi because they've all let you down
this year
but at least god help us we can trust
our major medical professionals
take for example the cdc and the world
health organization at least you can
trust
okay so they kind of let us down in the
last 12 months
but they're exceptions they're just a
few smattering exceptions of large
institutions that have let us down so
you know
medical community okay let us down a
little bit our entire
political news military industrial
department of justice
and if a member of the black community i
don't think you think the police are
acting
entirely legitimately that's why black
lives matter exists
but you trust black lives matter right
because black lives matter is an
organization that exists to condemn and
change another institution the police
which it believes are
corrupt and racist
so at least you can trust
black lives matter
you can't
all right so here
circling back to my original point
you're you're the democrats and you
believe these two things number one
that
biden won
the election's over and there's nothing
that could happen that would change yet
there's too much of a
win margin there and the other thing is
that 100 of the institutions
and systems that you thought were
trustworthy a year ago
every single one of them showed you that
you can't trust them
everyone
so
you've got some ptsd
you've been burned before
and everything that you're holding on to
your mental health if you're a democrat
in this situation your mental health
depends
on the election system waiting for it
wait for it your mental health
depends
completely on the election system being
the only
system in the entire
 united states
that isn't screwing you right now
do you believe it
if you're a democrat
are you really sure
that there's only one system
one organization
in the entire united states
there's one
that gets it right
and aren't we lucky
that it happened to be the election
system
what are the odds
what are the odds that the
election system is the one thing
that works the way it's supposed to
there isn't one other thing in
our whole
 country that worked the way it
was supposed to
and if you're a democrat your entire
mental health depends
on the biggest
 coincidence in the world
that there was one thing
you trusted
and it worked out just the way you hoped
it would
so
this is what i find funny
because you know
that whatever democrats are saying
publicly about how confident and happy
they are and they're picking out their
they're picking out their uh you know
people from the cabin etc
you don't you know that they're not
totally comfortable are they
they are not completely comfortable
should they be god no
are you kidding me
god no
i hope that's not using the the lord's
name in vain i can do that right
he said i'm not using the damn word if i
say god no that's still appropriate
isn't it
um
i have to check on these things once in
a while
all right so
let me show you
what happened in your your life in the
past year
this is my filter on the world
acknowledging that there are other
filters on the world that could also be
accurate all right
so sometimes the same set of
facts can be described by more than one
interpretation i'll give you mine and
the trick here is that the
interpretation that predicts the best
is the one probably you should adhere to
because if it predicts the best it's
going to keep you the safest right
so we're subjective creatures and we
walk around in our little imaginary
bubbles all the time but if you can find
a world view
that predicts pretty well pay attention
to that one here's what i saw happen in
the last
say 18 months or so
we saw
an election
in which the
i think you would agree
that the social platforms had great sway
we don't know exactly how to measure it
in a way that we would be comfortable
but is there anybody here
who would disagree with the statement
that the social media platform
changed the outcome of the election
anybody is there anybody who would who
would say that didn't happen
because we have unambiguous information
that
um
that the right was
throttled the right was uh you know
disenfranchised a little bit on social
media you'd all agree with that
statement right so i think we could say
that the social media platforms
influence the election
i think we can say that the news has
been fake both on the left and the right
if you're not willing to say
that a lot of the news not every single
story you see of course
but if you're not willing to say that
there's lots of fake news on the right
and lots of fake news on the left you're
not quite there
right there's another
level of red pillness you need to get if
you think the lying is all happening on
one side
that's not happening
because to believe that only the other
side is lied in terms of the news
that would violate everything i just
talked about we've seen every one of our
constant our institutions
and our systems break down in the past
year why would that be the one exception
oh yeah
the right leaning news business gets
everything right
what are the odds of that
nothing
all right how about uh the fake polls
there does seem to be
pretty solid indication that the polls
were designed for fundraising
so you've got fake news that's laying
this let's say air support cover
saying that the great orange menace is
bad in a hundred different ways he and
and most of it is based on hoaxes
as you know but the people on the left
do not they believe it's real news but
you know there's the fighting people
hoax the drinking bleak chokes the the
losers hoax the yeah i could just go
down the list it's all hoaxes
which is not to say that the president
never did anything that you know can't
be criticized
but the dominant
i would say the dominant narrative
from the left-leaning media about trump
i would say that it was based on fake
news wouldn't you don't you think that's
a completely fair statement and
supportable
so you got
your your social platforms are
brainwashing you
they're literally brainwashing you that
that word is not being used
hyperbolically
you are actually being brainwashed by
social media
you are being brainwashed and you you
get a little bit brainwashed by your
preferred sources of news but the fake
news is a brainwashing operation at this
point
i don't know if it was ever different
i just know it's obvious now
you know maybe in the past it was a
mixed bag
i always think the news was a little bit
of brainwashing because the government
probably always had a little sway there
but
at this point it's really obvious
then you've got maybe a fake election
we'll see
it does look to me
if i had to bat
and i will tell you that i've seen a
little bit more than you've seen
so
there's some stuff coming
that is different from the stuff you've
seen
but you're noticing that the news is
already uh disappearing the stories that
suggest the election was not pristine
so if you look at the headlines today in
the washington post and the new york
times and cnn
you'll see that there's a coordinated
and i'll use the word coordinated very
deliberately
and i don't mean they necessarily had
phone calls or meetings
i mean that they all know what to do
they're watching what the others are
doing they're saying okay yeah they
debunked this thing so we're going to go
debunk this one and we'll try to
we'll try to do a real debunk in most
cases i think they're real
or a fake debunk on anything that's real
because if you debunk let's say
five things in a row
and your debunking is better than the
original
what are people gonna believe when you
say the sixth thing is also
they're fake
to believe you're debunked right because
if you debunk five things in a row and
they look at your debunk and they go oh
i did believe this but now the debunk
makes more sense
are you going to believe that sixth one
nope
so that's how the brainwashing is done
the brainwashers are going to pick off
all of the least credible claims of
election fraud the small ones so they'll
make you think it's all small by looking
at all the small ones first of all then
they'll debunk them because they're not
true
it won't be hard to debunk most of them
because they're not true
it's just the nature of this thing that
confirmation bias
will always overwhelm
the real news so you know that there'll
be more fake ones than real ones
no matter how much real one there is
so finding a hundred fake ones in a row
does not prove that the real one doesn't
exist but isn't the news telling you
that
watch the news and see if you're not
being told this irrational story
we checked a bunch of these allegations
and they were found to not be true
therefore
all of the future allegations that we
haven't heard of
and the ones that we haven't looked into
are probably also fake
that's what they're selling you does
that make sense
no
it's completely reversed
what is completely reversed is if
there are real ones
almost certainly the
the fact that you can smell them
do you know what i mean can't you smell
the fraud and what i mean by that is
it's a situation in which fraud is
guaranteed to happen
if you can't see it specifically
that doesn't mean it's not there right
take the stock market do you think that
today anybody will do any insider
trading any just anywhere in the world
do you believe anyone will make an
insider trade which would be illegal
of course
of course you don't have to see any
specific example
the reason you know it's dirty
the financial market is because there's
nothing that would stop it
that's why it happens all the time
inside insider trading is universally
just a crime that's happening in the
baseline all the time
the election is like the financial
market
you don't have to see the detail of a
specific crime
to know what's happening right because
it can happen
the payoff could be gigantic
and there are lots of people involved
this is one of the rules that i teach
you all the time if you have those three
conditions fraud happens every time
no exception here are the three again
it's easy to do
right and i would say fixing an election
they're probably a whole variety
they're probably 25 things you could do
of which you know maybe 20 of them you
get caught but five you don't so it's
easy enough right it's easy enough to
fix it
the upside gain is
huge gigantic
so of course there's an incentive so
it's possible
the incentive is off the chart
the odds of getting caught are
vanishing
do you know anybody who went to jail for
election fraud
apparently if it's happening people are
getting away with it most of the time
you do hear little cases of people
getting caught
so under those conditions you smell it
you don't see the examples but you can
smell it
and so if the fake news which is
brainwashing you and i would say at this
point is really
it's just so obvious that you can't
interpret it any other way
they are trying to brainwash you into
believing that if they can debunk enough
of these ones that are legitimately not
real
that you will also believe that the next
ones are not real because you're going
to see the pattern you're like oh it's
just more of these debunked stuff
my best example is that project veritas
got a whistleblower a postal employee
who claims that the boss told the
employees to back date some of the
ballots which would make them valid
instead of invalid
now that was the claim and then he was
interrogated by
law enforcement
and the washington post
ran an article that says he recanted his
claim
and you say to yourself whoa
wow
so he made a claim that's a pretty
big claim that the post office was back
dating ballots that's a big claim
and
stop crying
i'm going to talk about you in a while
but
i'm going to block you first
so anyway
this is another part of the phenomenon
the the brainwashing phenomena
so a
a weird
part of the brainwashing phenomenon
is that people are imagining a version
of me that isn't happening
have you seen me look unhappy yet
because i'm not i'm not unhappy on the
inside either
i'm just not unhappy i kind of thought i
might be
i suspected that if trump lost i might
be unhappy
but it didn't happen
now partly because
there's more to this game we could be in
the third act not at the end
but
i believe that democrats have decided
that
i am unhappy because in their minds i
must have to be unhappy because they
make the
they make the uh the flaw in thinking
that i i'm like them
and if they were unhappy when they lost
and they remember how bad that felt
it makes sense to them that if i'm in
the same situation i would have the same
mental
feeling
i don't
not even
close
i'm having just good days like i
normally do they're not that different
my baseline happiness didn't even take
a flutter basically and
but people are imagining that they're
seeing me
crying and struggling with the outcome
have you seen this yet if you see my
twitter feed you'll see it every now and
then people will be quite sure
that i'm having some kind of a breakdown
and i don't know if i could be further
from it my mental health is
in my own self-assessment would be the
best that it's been in years
because
i don't know i feel pretty good i just
don't have a lot to worry about at the
moment
um
somebody says remind them you're married
to christina
yes christina's got her pilot license
and she's working on her ifr
designation she'll have that pretty soon
she's
very impressive
um
so what was i talking about oh yeah
so they're disappearing the news story
of the the election
potential fraud
and it's really amazing so let's put
this all together
so you had the social media platforms
brainwashing you that's not too strong a
word
that word is
right down the middle of what's
happening
now they may have good intentions and i
suspect they do
but it is still brainwashing because
they are determining what you will think
and feel by their algorithms and they
are doing it intentionally and they're
making you feel a certain way because
they think that's the better world or
better for them or something
so you got the social media platforms
you got the fake news you got the fake
polls i don't think anybody would
disagree that the that these were
uh intentionally fake polls and it's
obvious now that the reason was it's
good for fundraising and it also
depresses the polls so if you didn't
know this there is science i'm told i
haven't checked it myself but i'm told
there's science that says that the polls
can affect turnout
so if you've got the social media
affecting turnout the fake news
affecting turnout the fake polls
affecting turnout and on top of that
a questionable election
what exactly happened here
and then on top of all that
bad behavior
the news can now clean it up so you're
seeing cnn act like the crime scene
cleaner like they're scrubbing all the
blood off of everything and they're and
they're they're just trying to clean up
the crime scene
so that the crime is lost in history
and
as as somebody who's a trained hypnotist
i have
probably a more direct
um let's see view of what's happening
than some of you don't
if if you haven't put it all together
into a package like i just did it's an
entire package of brainwashing that all
works together you have to have them all
you have to have the the social media
the fake news the fake polls you have to
have a fake election that helps and then
you have to disappear it all with the
fake news and the social platforms and
you're watching it happen
right in front of you
i
i find
although this is evil in the deepest
possible sense of the word evil
i'm kind of exhilarated by it
because watching it happen right in
front of you is like a dream come true
if you're me
to see all of these things happen in
real time and see them work
is just it's like having a ticket to the
greatest show on earth if you study
persuasion now what's happening to the
world
not so good maybe
you know you could your opinion may
differ
but the technique
the skill that's going into this level
of manipulation
is mind-boggling it is really really
good
all right
um
and so the fake news is saying there's
no stories of dead people voting
despite what you hear there's nothing in
the post office going on
um there was that rumor that real clear
politics reversed its call for arizona
but that never happened they had never
called it in the first place
and do you think we're closer
to the weirdest prediction anybody ever
made which was mine
that we would have
two presidents at the same time
one declared by cnn and one later hasn't
happened yet
declared by fox news do you see that
happening
because here's how i think we're going
based based on the information i have
which is a little bit more than you have
okay so if your opinion disagrees with
me
just keep in mind i might have a little
more
information that you will have
eventually and it goes like this we will
find enough
fraud
to reverse the outcome of the election
so
everything you've seen so far the
allegations of fraud none of them would
add up i don't think they would add up
even if they were true
but you haven't seen the good stuff yet
and the good stuff would reverse the
outcome if it could be found to be true
here's the setup we're heading toward
and it will be the weirdest outcome you
would say to yourself this isn't even
possible and i'm going to predict it
right now
president trump will prove
that the election was false
and that he won on
votes
the mainstream media and social media
are now so strong
they can make it go away
in other words he can prove
beyond the shadow of anybody's doubt who
let's say was a supporter
to the point where fox news is going to
say uh
you make a really good point there
and if we're just going to count the
votes
i guess we're going to have to declare
president trump the president-elect and
possibly the president
meanwhile cnn
should this happen
just as a mental experiment imagine if
you will
that trump and his lawyers prove
to the public in really good evidence
not not anything you've seen so far
which has not been that conclusive and
not really persuasive but suppose just
hypothetically
there's something coming in the next
week
that's so big
and so clearly true
just easy to check clearly true
that fox is going to be able to say that
trump won the election and cnn is going
to say and here's the freaky part
no he didn't
none of that happened
or what you're looking at you're
misinterpreting
or what you're looking at just doesn't
exist
that's happening
right in front of you
now did anybody else predict that we
would have two presidents at some point
i don't think so
i believe i'm the only one who predict
that now i see in the comments and this
is this is a good comment
you're saying that you believe that fox
news has flipped
and become sort of you know
cnn light or something
i think that what you've observed
is suggestive of that
meaning that they're simply
i would say it is true that fox news is
just in the foxhole with
trump and no matter what he says they're
going to agree with
that's not the case anymore if you ever
thought it was the case i'm not sure i
thought that was completely the case but
it's definitely not the case now i would
say that unambiguously at least the the
news portion of fox news
is reporting things that the president
would not want to hear on the news
the opinion people are still a little
friendlier of course
but fox news is not so gone
that they wouldn't know that their
business model would be best supported
by a real strong story that trump really
won
right
so somebody says uh
you've raised expectations now you
better hit it
well suppose i don't
suppose i don't suppose in the end this
evidence does not rise to the level of
even where you're convinced
would it ruin your life
because if you think it would
i feel like you need to work on yourself
a little bit
there's nothing happening none of these
potential paths because i i'm i'm not
predicting we're going to have civil war
i don't think that one's even any
possibility
but
none of these paths are going to kill
you
they really won't you'll be fine
you might even get
you know a 2024 election with president
trump back in the mix
anything could happen
if you ask me the most likely outcome
looks like this are you ready for it
this will be the weirdest prediction
the prediction will be that trump will
prove his case
that he actually won
but the media
will be so strong between the you know
the democrats have the house they've got
the the news they've got social media
collectively that will be so strong that
they will put biden in office anyway
because there's always an argument right
they'll argue well yeah i see your
evidence but it doesn't count because
legal technicality xyz
fox news will say you're misinterpreting
those legal technicalities
really this is the truth
you're going to have two complete truths
that are whole
and both of them will be opposites one
is a president biden wasn't one as a
president trump
and here's what i think will happen
president trump will concede
and he will concede but here's the track
and and my prediction requires this part
so if later you say scott
you said president trump would concede
it requires this part or or it doesn't
count
and the part is that he proves his case
first
because he could prove that he won
and then concede
and then run for 2024.
if that happened bear with me
what would be the outcome
of letting the biden administration show
its stuff for four years
while you knew that the election was
stolen
let's say you knew it was stolen and
then for four years you watched them
flail around
while the political right beats them
with a hammer because you know mitch
mcconnell is not going to make it easy
and they haven't
done much
what would happen are you ahead of me
yet are you thinking ahead yet
think to 2024
and you've had four years of a biden
administration
not killing it at the same time that the
right-wing media is hammering them and
making them look like clowns because
they will
and then trump is running for president
against
an allegation that they actually stole
the election and he shows his evidence
and you believe it
what happens in 2024
republicans sweep
everything
it puts the republicans in charge of the
house
the senate and the presidency
maybe for a long time
so have you ever heard the statement
beware of what what you wish for
what the democrats wish for is for biden
to be declared the winner and to take
office
if it happens
they might lose everything
in 2024
because
the the one thing that can make you fail
is being in power
if you're not in power you can't do
anything wrong
so trump had the disadvantage that he he
fixed a bunch of stuff
that he fixed so early you forgot about
it
right
did when you voted in 2020 were you
worried about kim jong-un
nope
were you worried about isis
nope
were you worried that if we could get
the coronavirus under control that a
president trump could bring the economy
back
nope
president trump took a whole bunch of
things you used to worry about and just
got rid of him
so all you had to think about was what
was happening recently
that put him at quite a big disadvantage
and then plus the election
had a lot of brainwashers involved all
right somebody says he'll be 78 isn't
that what biden is
um now i'm not saying that it is my
opinion that he should run for president
in 2024
i said
if anybody remembers that when he won
his first term
i said
uh that's kind of old
and maybe you should be a first term or
a one-term president and just like kill
it
just kill it in one term and walk off
the stage
that didn't happen
maybe it would have been best we don't
know
and now the uh mainstream
uh press is worried that he's gonna get
the military on his side i wouldn't
worry about that
um and then the people were making lists
here's the here's the funniest one i
guess rick wilson in the uh lincoln
project you know they're the so-called
republicans who were anti-trump and ran
a big campaign against them
and now they're putting together a
tv
social media campaign
targeting targeting jones day
for their role in enabling trump's
effort to overturn the election so
they're actually going after a law firm
that is doing just what a law firm does
which is a client hires them
the client might be in the right the
client might be in the wrong but it's
the
legal profession's job to let
everybody's case be heard
and these these idiots in the lincoln
project are going after a law firm
simply for taking a job
what about going after the
the people who provide
electricity to mar-a-lago
don't you think the lincoln project
should
be working against the public utility
that gives electricity to president
trump's home
because those got you know
they're they're just enabling this
president right i mean so it's the
dumbest thing ever but here's the
that's the drink here's the chaser
uh jennifer rubin also uh anti-trumper
she's she doesn't like what the lincoln
project project lincoln is doing
and she says i agree and implore my
friends at project lincoln their friends
wow
to knock this off
uh there are bar authorities and proper
means to do this do not start a frenzy
in an atmosphere in which death threats
unhinge behavior and verbal assaults of
the norm stop
so jennifer rubin who i believe is one
of the people who wants to make the list
of trump's supporters doesn't she
do i have that wrong
and so i've decided to make a list of
anti-trumpers
because you need mutually assured
destruction to stop some things
some some things just can't be fixed
without mutually assured destruction
and so the left has decided that they
will target
for elimination at least
career elimination of
anybody who supported trump and i say
well let's start a list
let's let's start our own list
don't you think you could start a list
of people that should not have jobs
because they're on the other side of you
politically
how useful would that be
well i don't think any of that is a good
idea
but probably it doesn't stop without
some kind of pushback all right
let's see what questions we've got oh
did you notice that president trump
retweeted me yesterday it's the weirdest
world
you know my my world is
super small most of the time and that it
just flashes big and then it goes back
to super small again so for example my
my day yesterday would be
cleaning up my dog's knickers poop
um
washing the dishes or putting them in
the dishwasher
um
brushing my teeth you know that's my
normal day
most of what i do is not this
you know 98 of it is just
doing little stuff and then
and then uh president trump retweets me
and then suddenly i go from the smallest
life in the world it's like i'm just uh
eating a banana in my kitchen
all by myself
bump just paying no attention to the
rest of the world and the most powerful
person in the universe the president of
the united states is retweeting me
and the thing he received was was a
tweet i said
to the public i said you're being
brainwashed to accept the results of the
election as fair
you will be told that you will be told
that only bad people are skeptical in
this situation
and that you will be held to account
for doubting
and
the one that i tweeted had 22 000
retweets which would be my record by far
so apparently this is hitting home
and the president retweeted it yesterday
which is
weird
all right
you never really get used to that i
most of you have not had this experience
of course
that you're just minding your own
business and then the president of the
united states is tweeting about you
it's the weirdest thing
and it makes me think i'm living in a
simulation but let's look at some of
your questions
uh
and for reasons that are unclear to me
that tweet is not showing up but i know
i can find it
how is this possible
that that tweet can there we go
all right here are some of your
questions
um
if trump isn't in the news will i still
be doing this yes
right so with or without trump i will
continue with the
the live streams we'll see where it goes
i never i didn't have any plan
to be where this ended up
uh i don't know if you've noticed but
the live streams have just went through
the roof so i'm getting hundreds of
thousands of views on these now i don't
know if that lasts
you know after inauguration but i'll
keep doing this and see if the audience
wants it i'll keep doing it let's put it
that way i would only do it if there's a
demand and we're all having fun so as
long as we are i'll do it
raul davis
says why does the universe feel like
it's going to fold inside out
well
i think what's happened
if you recall my
biggest
uh weirdest prediction in 2016 or 15 i
forget might have been 15. when i said
that president trump would change more
than politics he would change how
reality looked
that happened right wouldn't you agree
that your view of reality itself
specifically the credibility of our
systems
how easily people are brainwashed you
know how we make decisions just the way
things work wouldn't you say that's all
turned inside out
and i think that's the trump effect and
it's what i had predicted in 2015 and
you're feeling it now
based immigrants says how do we move
forward if trump loses
same way you do anything
you know one day at a time
you wake up you have breakfast it's not
going to be that hard
right
and there will always be a resistance so
if you're not
on the trump supporting team there will
be something to be against
and being against things is fun too
as democrats found out
um
it's not easy after four years of
vitriol what could we do you know i
think people adjust faster than you
think
i
i've always thought that our
our impulse for normality or our impulse
to return to the mean
is so strong that you could have all
kinds of trouble in this country and
then you just fast forward six months
and it re reverted to the mean
i don't know why
but that is very strong in this country
and it always makes me feel confident
um
ian
uh martijs
asked me can you ask people if anyone
has a comprehensive election data set
i can answer that question for you the
answer is it exists
it does not exist in the hands of
anybody who can give it to you
because apparently some of it has to be
has to be accessed through the legal
system
in other words if you don't have a judge
who's on your side saying yeah you need
to give me that data you're probably not
going to get it
so i don't believe there's one massive
place where somebody has all of the data
that can be had
in any way that you could get to it i do
believe that there are individuals who
are collecting you know one at a time
through the legal system through
whatever means they can find as much
data as they can about the election so
no that doesn't exist uh except with a
few people who went out and
found some way to get it one way or the
other and i don't know how complete it
is probably it's focused on the few
states that matter
um
what is an update on the likely path to
trump proving malfeasance and
overturning the states well the update
is we're a few days away from finding
out what he has
i would say to you if two weeks from now
you have not heard
some you know big shocking incredible
news about the election you probably
won't
all right so so let me put some uh
a little bit of certainty on this
if two weeks from today you're still
wondering if there's more more coming
probably not
but is there more coming right now
almost certainly
right nothing's 100 in this world so i
try to i try it's sort of a thing i'm
doing lately i'm trying to avoid using
certainty words and try to try to use uh
you know odds
i'm seeing in the comments many of you
asking about dr shiva apparently dr
shiva has done some analysis which would
indicate the election was not
entirely honest
now i haven't seen what he has but i've
seen a lot of other people's
analyses of that nature i would say
let me give you this
general way to look at it if you're
looking at any one person's analysis
it's probably wrong
now i'm not talking about dr shifa in
particular i just mean in general if
you're looking at this big all this
noise
of people looking at little things and
this state did that and here's this
anomaly
anything you're looking at from one
person
about one analysis they did on one
anomaly is almost probably certainly
wrong
which is completely different
from whether or not there is something
there to be seen
i think that there is something there
i would say that at this point you can
smell it
like you don't even have to see it
at this point you can smell it
but whether dr shiva's analysis is
exactly the you know the magic knife
that cuts this open or it comes from
some other source i do not know so i
can't give you any specific credibility
of any of these analyses
because i am not as smart as dr shiva
let me put it this way
if this uh those of you listening on
on audio only will not see this
wonderful demonstration but i'm holding
my hand up in front of my face and
saying if this is how smart you have to
be just to function in america
let's say that's an iq of a hundred and
that's good enough to get by in america
you have to be a little bit smarter
to perpetuate an election fraud
so you gotta outsmart the average people
so you gotta be a little bit smarter
than them to do an election fraud
the people who are looking for
alleged fraud
are
up here i'm now holding my hand outside
of the frame of the video
so
the thing that's the wild card
is that when you say hey dr shiva says x
y or z is true what do you think scott
i have a little bit of a disadvantage
because my intelligence is pretty good
like i'm proud of it
but dr shiva is sort of a
kind of a higher level
you know
stating the obvious he has many more
degrees than i have
and in this particular
field of you know math and science i
would certainly not uh
i would not pretend
that i could critique his work
so
he's a brilliant guy he has access to
probably some good information i would
take him seriously
so the only thing i can tell you is you
should take it seriously
but keep in mind doesn't matter who it
is
doesn't matter how many mit degrees he
has as as in the case of dr shiva
every individual claim you hear
probably false
which has nothing to do with whether or
not there's something there it's just
the individual claims are
tend to be not so credible
all right
um
and a lot of people are putting
faith in benford's law but i hear uh
i'm seeing in the comments that nassim
talib is a skeptical about benford's law
that's all you need to know about
benford's law
i just told you everything you need to
know
all right so benford's law is that
some numbers don't don't occur naturally
so if you see an unnatural vote count
uh that tells you there's some mischief
but if nasim talib who
uh
i think
i don't have the highest opinion of to
be honest i'm not gonna i'm gonna not
gonna knock him in public but he and i
let's say uh we are not uh
we are not intellectually aligned
we will not be having lunch
i'll just say that so we disagree on
some stuff but it is nonetheless true
if you're in a statistics contest you
want him on your team
right you can disagree with him all you
want but if you're having a statistics
fight
you want to get massive tell him on your
side
and if he's skeptical about it i
i take that as meaningful
i'm being asked if
donald trump should hire joshua lisik to
write his presidential memoirs
well let me tell you this joshua if
you're listening
i i'm not going to ask anybody in the
trump family what are you doing after
the election
not the time
it's not the time
to be uh approaching president trump
about his alternative
uh paths should he not be president in
2021
so i won't be asking that question
but there's a time for it to be asked
we don't know when
let's see will dr shiva's analysis make
it to the
supreme court
i don't think you have to worry about
that
meaning that there are enough people
looking at similar things
that if there's something there
let me put it this way if there's
something in the numbers that's big
enough
that dr shiva sought it's also big
enough in other words if it's big enough
to matter
and dr shiva saw it you could be quite
certain
that the other people looking for also
saw it remember i did the uh the hand
thing about how smart dr shiva is and
how i you know i can't i can't possibly
critique his math or statistics or
science i wouldn't even try
the other people
who are also looking into this with even
better data sets than dr shiva would
have access to
they are as smart as dr jiva which is a
pretty high standard right but i
guarantee you the smartest people in the
world are looking into this
and i don't think democrats quite
expected that
um
all right some more questions
will trump run in 2024 um i
i can guarantee you that he's flirting
with the idea
that's all i know you can guarantee that
he's flirting with it yeah on on the if
if
if it needs to be happened
um
what's the likely future of uh the woke
people saying
i don't understand that question all
right
odds of a major false flag over the next
four years to discredit a mega comeback
a false lag in other words blaming
trump's supporters for some big crime or
something like that oh well i would say
the odds of uh something like that are a
hundred percent
um but not necessarily a planned false
flag rather trump supporters just being
blamed for stuff that wasn't necessarily
indicative of being a trump supporter
so you'll have lots of fake news in that
direction probably nothing that's like
some big
you know mass
uh
psyop uh let's see
what are your thoughts on the
resurrection story well that's what i
said
resurrected trump would be the funniest
trump because he would come back
stronger like jesus
um
if trump started a media platform
for real news
uh would many be interested
of course
can you imagine president trump starting
his own
news platform or social media platform
if i were the president all you'd have
to do is you know buy parlor and
oan and put them together and have a
have a social media platform and a news
platform and
and it would immediately be the number
one
property on the right if i were fox news
i'd be worried about that right now
all right um
let's see did i know somebody asked carl
asked that in 2004 exit polling the way
international observers grade the
legitimacy of foreign elections
ceased being accurate
and has now been discontinued in the u.s
all right i have to dig into that so i
can't answer that without knowing the
details
but that's scary if they change the
the you know the standard for what looks
like a fair election
uh why doesn't my twitter see your
periscopes for the last two days all
right this is a question that i get all
the time
so people will say your tweets or your
periscopes used to show up in my feed
and now they don't i know it's been
happening for a long time and i know
that recently people have been
mentioning it but it could be there's
more people mentioning it because
there's more people watching because my
traffic on the live streams like i said
is up by you know four or five times
compared to normal
so i don't know if anything's different
but i can tell you that i get this a lot
and in fact
ethan says right below the comment me
too
and i'll bet if i click on this other
people are saying me too
me three yeah so
other people are agreeing same here
i don't see it either anymore i don't
know the answer the question but i don't
know that it's mischief
okay
i don't know that it's mischief what i
do know is that people report it and i
don't know the explanation it could be
something about the algorithm and
settings and it could be completely
natural it could be that you didn't
always ever see me there but you thought
you did i don't know
so i don't know the answer that question
but i know it's reported
frequently
um somebody says ben says uh judges are
equally fear afraid of uh enabling
hitler
so are very likely to throw out cases no
so
the question is if somebody if the
judges think that trump is hitler aren't
they likely to rule against him even if
he has a a good case and i think there
are enough conservative judges now that
you don't have to worry about that right
you know certainly if you get the
supreme court you don't have to worry
about that
i don't think the supreme court judges
think that trump is hitler
uh
will any state legislatures elect the
electoral college electors well i think
what you're asking is
will there be faithless uh electoral
college electors and the answer that
depends on how good
the evidence of fraud is from trump and
what you can be guaranteed is that the
right will think it's good evidence and
the left will say it doesn't exist
so will that be enough for some
faithless electors i feel as though
people are gonna hold their power to
2024.
so here's
so my my prediction is going to be this
that trump will make his case
and he will prove to a reasonable person
standard which is not a political
standard because in politics nobody's
being reasonable everybody's just taking
aside
but if if you could imagine just in your
mind that there could be such a person
as a reasonable person
i believe trump will prove his case to
the reasonable person standard
but not
to the political standard in other words
he won't be able to take the office
even after having proved the case
i think that's where we're heading
which makes 2024 the
the fun the fun thing
um
what's my favorite coffee bean um so i
should mention this now i know a number
of you have sent me coffee
so there are some people who grind their
own or make their own coffee etc and so
uh every now and then i'll go out to the
mail and there'll be somebody will send
me some coffee i appreciate it
but i don't want to start mentioning it
every time somebody sends me something
because i really don't want people
sending me things at home my house will
just be full of things and then i have
to throw them away but i'll feel bad if
i throw them away but there's no place
to store them
so i'm trying to discourage you while
thanking you
sincerely so those who have sent me
stuff and i just got some coffee the
other day and some other things the
other day
i appreciate your thoughts
but
please don't because my house will be
full if i start taking stuff
so i just drink starbucks i'm not really
a coffee guy
in other words i'm not a
coffee
snob
i like any kind of coffee basically
outside of politics
daniel s what important truth do very
few people agree with you on oh i love
this question
daniel segundo so outside of politics
what important truth
do very people
very few people agree with me on well
it's hard to know what people other
people think
but i think the hardest one to accept
certainly the simulation would be the
hardest one but the hardest one to
accept is that your opinions are
assigned to you
nobody believes their opinions are
assigned to them
you might believe
you might believe that the people on the
other side are getting their opinions
from cnn but not you
not you
right you're not getting your opinions
from the media because you're a free
thinker so i think most people are under
the illusion that they're the exception
that they're looking at all the news and
they're making reasonable decisions but
man those other people what is wrong
with them
what is wrong with those other people
so until you get to that point
uh
you're you're not
on the same page with me
um
what happens if the electoral college
picks uh
kamala as president
i don't think we have to worry about
that being likely but isn't it funny
that it could happen
that could happen right there's nothing
that would prevent them from just
picking camellaris as the president
um
what is the name of the win bigly
uh sequel going to be well i haven't
decided to write another book yet my
process is that after writing a book i
have to take a couple years off lately
if it's a non-dilbert book because it
really
it really ruins your whole year to write
a book if you if you've never written a
book
while having a full-time job at the same
time you don't know how hard it is
it's really hard to write a book
and i don't think i ever would have
written the first one if i knew how hard
it was it's like having a baby you know
you
or at least i'm told i wouldn't know
personally but you give birth it's the
most painful you know experience but
then you know you love your baby and
you're all happy and it's joy and
everything and you you kind of get
amnesia
for how bad the birth part was
and if you didn't get that amnesia maybe
you wouldn't have any more babies so
it's probably like important that you
don't remember
bad stuff
all right
prediction of what a former president
trump would do back in the private
sphere well he won't go quietly we know
that
so i would expect him to be
one of the major
names and news whether he owns the news
channel or he's just part of it i don't
know
so i it's obvious that president trump
likes the life
so i think he would just continue it
um
olga asks what time is periscope
well olga i hope you're here
because that means you made it in time
have you ever noticed that when i
promote my
live streams i
often don't tell you where to find them
or what time it will be or what the url
will be
has anybody wondered why i do that
do you think it's a mistake
do you think that
it didn't ever occur to me that if i
tell you i'm going to be live on a live
stream it would be better to give you
the url
no i do it intentionally
of course sometimes i give you the time
you know but other times i know i i know
it would be convenient
and i don't do it anyway because i like
making people work
and the reason is it it offers a little
bit of friction
to joining us
and if you can overcome the friction
you're more likely to want to stay
because you worked to get here
if you come in here and it's too easy
the way your site the way brains are
organized anything that seems free
your brain will interpret to not worth
anything
that's very well understood and in fact
if you're a hypnotist one of the things
you will do is even if you don't need to
charge somebody to do some hypnosis you
should charge them
because charging somebody to hypnotize
them makes the hypnosis work better
because they kind of talk themselves
into it must be worth something because
they paid for it
our brains are so tied to if i paid
money for it it has value if i didn't
pay money for it it probably doesn't
have that much value now i'm not talking
about things like love that you can't
buy right but just services
uh or or anything so generally speaking
you you don't want to make something
too easy
because it will make it look worthless
does that make sense
if i if anybody could find this easily
without having to work a little and
google and
find out how do i watch it on periscope
or on the podcast it's three different
ways
which one has the the thing where i can
speed it up
this is all intentional
because i didn't want to grow in terms
of an audience unless the audience
really wanted me to
and so i make it a little bit hard for
you so you can feel a little bit special
and that anybody who does the work to
find us here
will feel like they paid something it'll
feel like they work to get here and then
they'll stay
best places for expatriates i'll tell
you i've been thinking about that a lot
the trouble with moving out of the
united states
if you wanted to say oh screw it my
taxes are too high or whatever
is that i don't want to go to a country
that has bad emergency recovery response
because it seems like the story of every
country is emergencies
you got your hurricanes you got your
floods you got your earthquakes you got
your civil wars
you know those are the things that will
take you out
so when i'm thinking about what would be
a better place in the united states i
have to think where would i least likely
be killed or
taken out by a natural disaster and it's
tough to beat california if you're not
on the coast all right if you're on the
coast maybe the earthquakes get you and
the tsunamis and
god knows what but i'm inland enough
that
and my house is earthquake proofed
and i also like to live where if you
lose electricity you won't die
right i've thought about moving to las
vegas
but if you're if you have a home in las
vegas and the electricity goes out
and it's 120 degrees
i don't do you die how does that work
if you move to some place where it's you
know
zero degrees out and your electricity
goes out
do you die
i don't want to live somewhere where
i'll die because my electricity went out
all right so i don't have an answer to
that but i've been thinking about it too
um
talk about cash patel well i would just
say see that movie what's the name of
the movie the uh
the plot to plot to defeat the president
what's the name of the
the movie somebody will say it in the
comments
um
any advice on writing sales emails i
don't that's sort of a specialized field
you can just google that you'll get all
the advice you want
are roadside political signs of any
value
i've been thinking about this for years
when i was a kid i used to say to myself
what is the point of putting a sign in
your lawn
is there somebody who doesn't know who
to vote for is going to be driving along
in their car and they're going to see a
biden sign in their lawn like oh
finally i know who to vote for
because this stranger guy has a sign in
his lawn and when i was a kid that
didn't make any sense and probably to
most of you you're thinking well this
makes no sense
but as an adult you get a richer
understanding of psychology and you
realize that if you think your your
neighbors are doing something
you're more likely to do it so yeah
there's a herd mentality if you think
everybody around you was voting for the
same person
it would make it really easy for you to
vote for that same person if you didn't
have
let's say you weren't really deeply
committed to the other the other person
let's say you were genuinely undecided
and just the signs were all one way
it would make a difference yeah it's a
social proof
so i would say yes i don't think
anybody's ever tried to measure it
how does the dominion software work i
don't know the answer to that but it is
part of a larger system in which there
would be
multiple components so it's not like one
module of software it's a system for
getting the votes and tabulating them
and moving them to the right place and
putting them in the right database etc
so there are lots probably i would guess
lots of places for vulnerability
when and how will kamala harris become
president well if biden becomes
president
big if
um the odd just the odds of him still
being healthy for the whole four years
are what 50
tops
and i would think that they would want
her to take the top job
before she even runs for president so
they could say she's an incumbent
running for re-election which is much
stronger than a vice president running
for election for the first time much
stronger
so i would think if i were the democrats
uh somewhere around the
or third year
i would start saying you know joe's got
this little thing he needs to go to the
doctors for on a regular basis and well
it's looking a little bit
worse and well joe is perfectly fine but
he's concerned that it might change soon
and so for an abundance of caution
well joe biden is still perfectly fine
but we don't know it will stay this way
we're just going to be careful because
we're democrats and we care so we're
gonna
put kamal up to the top spot and it
would be purely an election move
to make her a stronger candidate all
right
um
can we do a simultaneous bong rip one
day you know i can't tell you how many
times i've considered doing that
spontaneously i just want to turn on the
live stream and
do a couple of bong hits with the people
who care but
one of the bad parts about getting a big
audience
which at this point is pretty big
is
you feel a certain responsibility
in other words uh you know i've still do
this before but you don't tell the
audience who you are the audience tells
you
so if the audience told me that's who i
am i'd probably do it
but right now i'm not sure that the
audience
wants that
it feels like it feels like that
wouldn't be
on brand at this point and again brand
is determined and determined by you
i'm not really determining my own brand
people are deciding who i am based on
based on a lot of stuff all right
so
maybe but probably not all right uh
i just use a regular coffee machine
somebody's asking me that
but it does that uh
crema stuff
what are the chances of an eventual aoc
presidency pretty good
you know if you factor in her age
and that you factor in her talent
the odds of an aoc presidency someday
pretty good if i had to put the odds on
it
at least 20 percent
if you're looking at some day you know
40 years in the future
um
what is the best path to learning or
mastering persuasion well i took a
course in in hypnosis but you'd have to
google and talk to references and
see if you could do that too that's the
best
base
everything you learn on top of hypnosis
will will connect to something you've
learned in hypnosis
either directly or indirectly so if you
have that base
and what what you learn by actually
learning to hypnotize people is the
thing that you can't get out of a book
the thing you can't get out of a book
is believing it
you just can't there are some things you
just have to see with your own eyes
to know it's even possible
and when you see people under hypnosis
acting a certain way in person
and you know that the people involved
are not
they're not playing a trick on you
because of the people you brought into
the room and you see it over and over
and it's reproducible etc
your understanding of the
the limitations of the human mind for
rationality
completely disappears
and you understand people as being
little meat robots
that just respond to inputs irrationally
and once that becomes your firm
understanding of how things really are
every other piece of persuasion that you
learn from books etc the book behind me
win bigly is the one you would want to
start with if you wanted to learn
persuasion so
that book makes way more sense if you're
a trained hypnotist
i would like to present to you the
following thought
you've seen me talking about trump's uh
mastery of persuasion for several years
have you ever seen somebody who's a
trained hypnotist
disagree with my take on trump
nope
you've seen people disagree with me on
just everything all over the board
there's always somebody who disagrees
with anything
but you have never seen
correct me if i'm wrong
fact check this you've never seen a
trained hypnotist
say oh that stuff you're saying about
trump that's
that's exaggerated or that's that's not
real
they all see it
and once you have that base of training
you'd see it too um
so uh lancer says i unplugged from
social media and all media for a week
and the world didn't end and i found
myself thinking and feeling quite
rational am i crazy
you know if you haven't experimented
with this
uh
you really need to because i've been
experimenting with it lately
so
last few nights
i've tried to see what i would feel like
if i didn't
spend as much time on social media i
can't seem to go cold turkey
but if i just cut down how many times
i'm looking at it
so i can just
live in my life you know live in the the
now
and i've been trying that for the last
few days and i got to tell you it's
really good for your mental health
so you should give it a try
um
somebody so the old guy that's his name
on here is asking about the michigan
software accounting glitch
i think all of the news about the
glitches
you should put a little uh
little asterisks next to that here's why
if what you observed was the the the
count on the screen
suddenly changing to something it
shouldn't be
you're going to say to yourself ah uh i
found it
there's fraud
because there's there's no way you could
get let's say
5 000
joe biden votes with no trump votes
if that's what you're thinking i would
suggest you should reduce your
confidence
in that being the the kill shot here
if you were going to um
do something devious to a vote machine
you would probably be smart enough
not to change it in a way that the cnn
would show it on their screen during
prime time
and that's the allegation that you can
see the numbers
change to something fraudulent in real
time while you're watching cnn because
they have a feed
they have a feed from that system and
when it changes it's like oh that can't
be a natural change
i would say that if you had been around
software a little bit more
you would not be so confident
because software can do a lot of stuff
that doesn't look natural
then maybe is
for example
could it be that the uh
the trump votes and the biden votes are
in different
databases
could it be that they exist separately
and then they are combined at the end
i don't know
i don't know if there's any reason to do
that maybe maybe you just put them all
in the same database and you just say if
it's a
biden or a trump victory but do you know
do you know the answer to that question
are they all in the same database all
the time
during the entire part of the the
process or is there ever a time
when the the biden votes are in a
separate database
from the trump votes before they get
combined what do you think
because if they're ever in separate
bins
that opens up the possibility that
they're simply updating in batches
and maybe one had a delay
so imagine if you will that there are
two sub
buckets
and they're being filled with trump
votes in one bucket and biden votes in
the other and then when they get a few
votes in there
they send those updates to the the
combined system
but then
there's a little glitch in one of the
buckets
it doesn't lose any votes it doesn't
gain any votes and it doesn't make any
mistakes it's just delayed a little bit
and being delayed just
one second
builds up five thousand biden votes in
the bucket and then it does what it's
supposed to do
it dumps them to the the final bucket
what it would look like to you is that
five thousand biden votes came in and it
couldn't possibly be a coincidence
because it isn't
the coin the the non-coincidence is
that it was just a one-second delay in
an update
that affected nothing
there was nothing affected by it it was
just a one-second delay in one part of
the system completely normal and it
batched up a bunch of votes and
delivered them at the same time
nothing changed in the final outcome now
do i know that there are
two buckets
no
i don't know that i'm giving you an
example
so that you can allow your imagination
to expand
to understand that in the software world
there could be another explanation why
you could get a whole bunch of votes all
in one way
electronically
now
if somebody came in with a big box of
written
uh mail-in ballots and every one of
those ten thousand mail-in ballots had
one name on it well that's probably not
a glitch
so if you find out something like that
well that's not a glitch now just
because those big bucket glitches
might not be real they could be real
they could be exactly what they look
like it could be fraud
but even if it's not real
that doesn't tell you a single thing
about whether the system is fixed if you
were going to rig a system and you were
good enough
software wise that you could get into
this
obviously protected system you would be
a high level person right you're not
dumb
you're very smart and you want to cover
your crime would you ever create a
fraudulent bug in the voting system that
delivered
40 000 votes to the same person at the
same time
you wouldn't
you take a little out of here a little
out of there
you take every let's say every precinct
you'd say oh let's just
just take off a few from here
it would be easier to subtract votes
than to add votes
right it'd be easier just to
ignore some votes that just never get
counted
just they just get ignored you would
never see that
you would never know anything was wrong
so i reject the idea that you can see
a
high-end fraud by watching cnn's feed on
the monitor
maybe
i'm not saying it's impossible
i'm just saying if i had to put the odds
on it i wouldn't bet on that one
i definitely wouldn't bet on that one
being the the kill shot
all right i've been going on way too
long and i think i will stop here so
i will talk to you
tomorrow
all right periscope is offline talking
to you youtubers alone
and thanks by the way uh youtube has
been growing like crazy uh
don't know why exactly but it has been
uh what will my two presidents
predictions do to the stock market stock
market does not like uncertainty
so it would be bad for the stock market
but eventually it can sort it down we're
not gonna we're not gonna have two
presidents forever
yeah youtube just has better quality
right
just the uh the video quality
all right that's all for now i will talk
excuse me to you tomorrow
