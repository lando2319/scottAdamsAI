what we can do
today. It's a Sunday, so the news was
kind of
slow, but not as slow as I
am. I'm pretty slow today.
[Music]
So, I I have to confess
um I was having a little muscle pain, so
I took a prescription
uh muscle
relaxant. And I'm not really good at
following
directions. So, I didn't realize how
loopy it would make me. So, at the
moment, I'm just whack that in my mind.
I can just barely stay
awake. And the good news is I don't have
any pain. I'm not in pain at all. But oh
my god, is my brain not functioning. But
welcome to Coffee with Scott
Adams. I I can't even remember how I
opened the show. I literally forgot the
the thing that I've done over 2,000
times in a row. Uh, but if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
you've never experienced before, all you
need for that is a cuper mug or a glass
of tank or chalicees dine, a canteen,
jugger, flask, a vessel of any kind.
Fill it with your favorite liquid. I
like coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
end of the day. The thing makes
everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now. Go.
You know, the responsible thing to do
would have been to not do a podcast
because I'm really not capable. Like,
I'm not joking. I am absolutely not
capable of doing this. But we'll see
what happens. If you want to see a train
wreck, came to the right place.
I often tell you it's a
superpower to not be embarrassed about
things. No embarrassment at all. I I'm
just degraded by
80%. So, I have no idea what's going to
happen. Well, what else can coffee do
for
you? According to No Ridge, uh coffee
can help protect your
liver. Uh that's why I soak my liver in
coffee every day and you should too.
So, is there anything that coffee can't
do? No. No, we can do it
all. Here's some news that I can't get
enough of from the legal newsine. Uh,
apparently the state of Illinois is
suspending their DEI scholarships
because the Department of Justice went
after them for being a bunch of
racists. Um, I I can't get enough of
this. Every time DEI is banned because
the government says it's racist, I just
feel like I'm
redeemed. You know, it feels like 35
years of my
life have finally been
validated. Um, so
yes, no DEI scholarships at uh several
universities in
Illinois. So good for the Department of
Justice.
Well, it turns out that threats work.
Um, something I didn't know until
recently. Apparently, the US and Mexico
have had this very long-term water
agreement where we give them water from
one of our sources, but they give us
water from one of their sources. And
it's all for the farmers, I think,
mostly from the farmers. And Mexico was
going to reduce the amount of water. And
Trump threatened them with tariffs. and
suddenly they released the
order. So, how many times has Trump
threatened somebody and it worked? You
know, you don't want to think that
threats work, but apparently they do.
Yeah, Trump's threats work pretty well.
So, Mexico, we got our water. Thank
you. So, here's something radical and uh
dangerous. There are now several states
that are getting together to put
together what they call a criminal
referral for a number of the characters
that you remember from the pandemic.
Fouchy, Burks, Winsky, and bunch of
others. And what do you think they're
being referred for? Now, referred just
means somebody's recommending that the
Department of Justice do something or in
this case, I guess the states. Um I
think wasn't it Fouchy who has a pardon
for any federal crimes. So you have to
go after him in in the states if you
want to get any uh
traction. So the Verus Law Group and
then former feds group Freedom
Foundation they've submitted their uh
their I guess their evidence and their
plan for these guys. But listen to the
crimes that they're accusing Fouchy and
Burks of. Uh, murder.
They're accusing of a murder, negligent
home homicide, involuntary
manslaughter, medical coercion and
abuse, kidnapping,
kidnapping. Um, human trafficking for
forced labor, racketeering, operating a
corrupt organization, and terrorism.
I I feel like they I feel like they had
a good idea, which is to use the states
to go after some people who maybe have
some things to
explain. But once you add, you know,
terrorism and
kidnapping, I feel like you lose a
little bit of credibility. You know,
murder was bad enough, but I, you know,
you could see where murder would come
from. But
terrorism, how do you get terrorism out
of that? All right. Um, RFK Jr. saying
that the deep state is real and uh he
called his FDA employees, so these are
employees under him. He he called FDA
employees sock puppets of the
industry according to
Politico. Can you imagine if your boss
called you a sock puppet of the
industry? The the entire point of the
FDA is to regulate, you know, the
pharmaceutical industry. But of course,
they they get owned because the
pharmaceutical industry has so much
money. And they can do things like
saying, you
know, you know, you're the kind of
person that we would hire for an
outrageously high salary once you're
done with the FDA. But, you know, that
would sort of depend how you do when
you're at the FDA because, you know, if
if you were to rule against us, I I just
wouldn't be able to recommend you for a
job here after your FDA stint. So, it's
really easy to
capture somebody who's working there.
But just imagine your boss calling you
out as a
puppet. Your entire your entire job is
to protect the public, but he's calling
you out as somebody who is not
protecting the public and is only
protecting the the bad
guys. That that's pretty
extreme. So, we'll see if uh RFK Jr. who
can survive any of this. But so far,
he's going hard at it. I think he's
hitting the deep state and the
bureaucracy all at the same time. So,
we'll see. How many of you saw that uh
photo
of Governor Gretchen
Whitmer? So apparently she was invited
to the White House because there was
some some executive order that Trump did
that uh even though she's a Democrat. Um
it was good for
Michigan. So she was happy that Trump
was doing something and when he invited
her to the White House, she said, "Oh,
okay." So she goes to the White House
and then she gets herded into a room
with a bunch of other people for what
was going to be a photo shoot and she's
a Democrat and she wants to run for I'm
guessing wants to run for president and
suddenly she would be photographed with
all these Republicans and sort of
celebrating Republican
victories. So how do you think she
handled it? What what what was her
professional way of handling the fact
that she got tricked into a photo shoot
but was expecting just to meet the
president oneon-
one? She holds a
binder. She holds a binder over her
face so that the photographs just just
show the bottom of
her. So instead of being uh
invisible, she does the opposite. It
becomes the biggest story because it's
so
weird. So So now there's not a single
person in the country who doesn't know
that she was in the Trump White House
getting her picture
taken. She choked. I don't know what I
would have done in that situation. I
mean, maybe I would have asked to leave
or something, but it's hard to leave if
the president's invited you in the room.
You can't really walk out. It'd be an
insult. So, I guess she figured the best
thing she could do is cover her face
with a
binder. Anyway, uh according to uh the
publication, The Independent, uh female
frogs fake death to avoid unwanted
advances from males. Now, they weren't
specific, but I believe they mean uh
male
frogs, not just, you know, every kind of
male.
Um, but it sounds like it sounds a lot
like a
wife, you know, faking
death, except when humans do it that
they they fake a
headache. But, uh, frogs are more
committed, you know, they're more like
the Democrats of amphibians.
So they're they're more like they're
more into the drama of it. It's like
instead of pretending I have a headache,
which doesn't really work in the frog
world because the boy frog is just going
to go at it anyway. Uh they have to fake
dead. like,
oh, and it makes me wonder how often
does the boy frog actually care if
they're
dead. Because if he gets in the right
state of mind, that boy frog is just
going to go nuts on that female frog,
even if she's pretending to be dead. And
then once you once you realize that's
their
trick, and you're the boy frog, and
you're like, I've seen this before.
You're pretending to be dead. All right,
I'll just cosby
you. So, that's what's happening in the
frog
world. Well, meanwhile, it's a real slow
news weekend. Uh Bernie Sanders went to
Coachella and gave a rousing speech that
nobody cares about. Uh but Trump went to
watch a UFC fight, which is always a big
event, and you know, it's great. Now
compare these two
approaches if you were to just stop
somebody in the street anywhere in
America and say do you even know what
Coachella is? How many would know what
it
is? I'm not even sure I know what it is.
I've been looking at it for years and I
I see pictures and people say they're
going and I read accounts of what
happened there and I still don't know
what it is. Apparently, it's this really
big dusty inconvenient thing that you go
to so that when you come back, you have
stories of how horrible it was. It was
all dusty and the bathrooms didn't work
and then we got stuck and we couldn't
get out. It's
music. Somebody says his music. All
right. Um, so I don't think Bernie got a
home run on that, but uh, Trump as usual
because he goes to the UFC and acts very
manly. It's just a perfect fit. So,
Trump for the win. I guess Meta, the uh,
Facebook company, is going to go to uh,
court on charges being a uh, monopoly, I
guess. So, they're being brought up on
antitrust charges. And one of the
possibilities is that they would be
forced to divest Instagram and
WhatsApp because apparently that's too
much social media for one company to
have. I don't really understand
that. So, so Facebook had a service that
showed pictures and you could share them
with your friends. And then they bought
Instagram, but it was still worth only
$1
billion. and they built it into, you
know,
behemoth. So why do they have to
divest? Is it just because they were too
successful? I mean, it's not like, you
know, it's not like Tik Tok doesn't
exist and it's not like uh X doesn't
exist. I feel like I feel like uh it
just doesn't feel like they
necessarily should should be broken up.
So, I'm not uh you know pro-
oligarch. Sorry, Bernie Sanders. I'm not
all about the oligarchs, but I don't
know. Is there any compelling reason why
WhatsApp can't be part of
Meta? That doesn't even make sense to
me.
Well, speaking of Facebook, they're
uh they're trying to make their AI llama
4 um more balanced, which means they
have to figure out how to make it more
uh at
least conscious of what the right
leaning part of the country thinks and
wants. So, they're apparently they're
quite aware that the way they trained
it, it made it a lefty, sort of turned
it into a Democrat.
And to uh Meta's credit, they don't want
it to be just a Democrat. So they're
they're putting effort into trying to
figure out how to make it less
left-leaning and more like
Grock. So that's
cool. I saw a good
uh saw a good thread by Rod Martin on X
um talking about Trump's new play. So
apparently he went ahead and and has
executed, we've heard of this before,
but there's a 60 foot wide strip of land
that runs across uh our southern border.
And apparently that's now been
designated to be military
property. And so our military can
operate on that 60 ft wide space, which
means that if you come across the border
uh illegally, you're going to be on a
military
base. And then the rules of how the
military treats things are in effect. So
that would
uh that would give them a little bit of
flexibility, the military anyway, and
how to how to handle it. And there'd be
no sanctuary there.
So when I say that, I think to myself,
why does the Trump administration always
come up with these kind of radical but
good
ideas? It seems like nobody else ever
had a good idea, but this whole 64
strip, that just feels like a good
idea. So So I'm kind of impressed by it.
Um, you know, Jasmine Crockett,
everybody's been watching the Democrats
rising star, Jasmine Crockett. She said
the other day that it's beyond wild that
no one is questioning Trump's mental
acuity. No one's questioning Trump's
mental
acuity. Well, we all saw what happened
when Bill Maher met Trump in person. Um,
he his biggest takeaway is that Trump is
not crazy, but he plays a crazy person
on
TV, which he
does. So, here's what the Democrats have
gotten wrong so far. So, the Democrats
were not able to judge that Biden had a
severe mental
disability. They none of them saw it.
They were not able to judge that Kla
Harris obviously has some kind of a
substance or drinking problem. None of
them saw it. Still
don't. And then when it came to
Trump, they got exactly the wrong answer
that Bill Marorrow tried to straighten
him out on, which is, huh, turns out
he's actually a really nice guy and
interested in people's opinions and uh
nothing at all like what you see on
TV. So, Democrats are 0 for three,
aren't
they? I don't like to brag, but I'm
three for three.
I was I was calling Biden mentally
incompetent in 2019. Jack, I've been
calling uh Kamla a you know a public
drinker, meaning that she appears in
public after drinking um for years.
Jack, of course I'm right about that.
And I knew that uh Trump was not crazy.
Indeed, you could argue that I was the
OG of explaining Trump starting in 2015.
Uh, I would be the one who would say, "I
know it looks
crazy. I know what you're saying. I know
it looks crazy, but if you look just
under the hood, you can see it's all
technique. It's what I call the show.
So Trump knows the difference between
who Trump is, you know, the private
Trump and the show. And when he is in
public, he puts on the show. And the
show is wild. I mean, you know, I was
saying it yesterday when he talked about
his uh medical
examination and he he said that his soul
was his soul was healthy. like they
check your
soul. It's something that nobody would
say. And I don't think he would say that
privately because it's, you know, just
sort of outrageous and crazy sounding,
but boy does he know how to put on the
show. He he doesn't know how to be
boring, you know, just talking about
normal things when he's in his showman
persona, you know, the public persona.
He He could just make anything sound
more interesting than it should have
been. I got a checkup and my soul is
really
good. I'll be laughing about that for
years.
Anyway, so the worry from Jasmine
Crockett that uh Trump's um mental
acuity needs to be tested, I'm going to
refer that to the Department of
Imaginary Concerns with all the other
Democrat
problems, imaginary
concerns. Um you probably heard that uh
Trump created some tariff exemptions.
So if you're uh trading smartphones and
computers and routers and semiconductors
and some other tech stuff, there will be
no extra tariffs on those. So that's
good. Every time Trump makes an
adjustment, the market should get a
little bit
happier. So this is exactly the sort of
adjustment that you'd want to see. So
yeah, good
job. Did you know that the what I call
the Gulf of America has apparently an
insane amount of energy
uh that can be tapped. And uh now Trump
is expanding the oil and natural gas
production. So Interior Secretary Doug
Bergam
um has ordered officials to hold an
offshore lease sale. So, you'll get to
bid on that. You know, I do wonder what
is the uh the modern
risk of drilling
offshore because, you know, we had that
big that big spill some years ago. Uh
but I wonder if it's if they figured out
how to how to avoid that now. I mean, I
don't know how you could, but makes me
wonder. Time has gone by, so I wonder if
it's a lot safer for the environment
than it used to be.
So that's good. So now now Trump has uh
opened up Anoir and he's opening up the
um Gulf of
America. He's also negotiating with Iran
and if that went
well, we'll talk about that. It would
release Iran's oil and he's negotiating
with Russia. And if that goes well, it
would presumably release more Russian
oil. So Trump's plan of making energy
sort of a centerpiece of his presidency
is looking really strong. So if he can
keep the oil prices down and the price
of gas down, uh everything else is going
to cost less. So I really like the
direction of that. Now, apparently his
uh tariffs, I don't know if it's because
the tariffs, but probably um a big
pharma company, Novartis, just said it's
going to put $23 billion into the US.
So, it's not an American company, but
because of tariffs, they're going to
bring $23 billion investment here. I
think Trump's doing a really good job in
at least promoting, you know, all these
big deals that are coming through. 23
billion's some serious money. I mean,
it's going to be over time, but still a
lot of
money. Let's talk about Doge.
So I was confused by Doge and maybe you
had the same thing which is Elon had
said very clearly that he was trying to
to take a trillion dollars a instead of
a
trillion it looks like he's targeting
150
billion. 150 billion is not close to a
trillion. A trillion is what we needed
to survive.
Did this really happen where where Doge
went in and they had all kinds of um
let's say they they thought they were
going to make all kinds of cuts and then
the bureaucracy came online and the
cabinet heads and the department heads
said, "Oh, nope. Not so
fast." No, we can't cut that. Can't cut
that. So, I get that it's 150 billion so
far, but I think that's also the the
final
number.
So, here's the weird thing. I I asked
Grock how much Elon Musk's personal net
worth has decreased because of all the
Tesla stuff, and apparently it's the
same number. So Elon Musk's personal net
worth went down 150
billion while Doge saved 150 billion.
Now one of them is once and the other is
every year.
But he could have just written a
check. Saves a lot of money. Saved a lot
of time, not a lot of money. But uh
we're currently, this is my take. We're
currently on a doom loop.
Is anybody going to admit it? Is Trump
going to tell us that we can't survive
in our current plan? Our current plan is
not
survivable. Let me say that
again. Our current explicit plan, our
budget is not survivable. It's not just
suboptimal. It's not survivable.
And I was counting on Doge to get that
trillion dollars. I thought it was a
stretch. I didn't think it would happen,
but you know, I was like, well, you
know, Elon can do things that other
people can't do. Now, I get that it's
$150 billion a year, but we were looking
to save a trillion dollars a year. Both
of them were per
year. So, I don't know, maybe I'm
misunderstanding something, but it looks
like Doge didn't work.
Am I
wrong? It looks like it didn't work
because working is not just that you
saved 150 billion, although that's
great. Working is saving the entire
country. So that that was the uh the
whole point of it. So I guess I'm
confused by that. Maybe there's
something I'm missing here.
Thomas Massie, of course, he's the uh
the debt
hawk.
Um he's pointing out that uh the current
budget is going to be $2.5 trillion
deficit every year for as far as you can
see. We can't do $2.5 trillion deficit
for as far as we can see. We're talking
about being completely out of business
in a few years.
I I don't know what's going on because I
was pretty sure that this is an
unsustainable level of
spending and apparently we're just going
to do it. We're just going to do an
unsustainable
thing. What am I missing? Did we really
decide that death was better than
life? Because life would require us
doing a bunch of things that the
bureaucracy doesn't like. I don't know.
Well, former former Google CEO Eric
Schmidt told Congress that 99% of all
electricity will be used to power
AI. Do you believe that according this
is according to Joe Wilkins and
futurism? Um, do you believe that 99% of
all electricity will be used to power
super intelligent AI? What would the
rest of us do?
Why would you even need super
intelligence if it was going to use all
of your
electricity? Like you wouldn't be able
to iron a shirt, but at least you'd have
AI. I know. I think he's probably just
making a point with
hyperbole. The point being we need a lot
more
energy. Uh, according to the Washington
Times, drug traffickers made 1.4 billion
from fentinel trade in 2024. I don't
know how they measure that. How in the
world could you know that number anyway?
And chi as you know China is the main
supplier of precursor chemicals but I
guess India is coming up fast too as a
supplier of these
precursors. So that's not good. It's if
it's that profitable nothing's going to
stop it. You know for people will do
anything for $1.4 billion.
You might know or maybe you didn't know
that the Hollywood writers were on
strike. How many How many of you even
knew that the Hollywood writers were on
strike? I didn't even know it. But
apparently during the strike uh the
losses of jobs were uh tremendous. They
42% of the writing jobs went away
between 2023 and
2024. 42% went
away. Wow.
So, I I always thought the shows had too
many writers. Anyway, some of my
favorite shows had one writer. Do you
remember the West
Wing and the uh the guy who wrote it?
Most of those were written by the same
guy. Do you remember Babylon
5? Mo most, if not all of them were
written by one guy.
So, I'm not It seems to me we have too
many
writers. That's what I
think. Anyway, there's some uh
negotiations going on between Iran and
the United States uh over in Oman. They
were there yesterday and uh both Iran
and the US
team said that it was a positive and
constructive talks. Now, what does that
mean?
So, the one and only thing we're really
asking of Iran is you can't have a
nuke. So, what does the meeting sound
like? All right. Uh, the one and only
thing we want is you can't have a nuke.
Oh, we're definitely going to have a
nuke. And then what do you talk
about? What could you possibly talk
about when the one thing that you want
is the one thing they're never going to
give you? Is is there nuance there? Is
there anything else on the table that
they need to talk about? Because if they
get the no nukes part, probably
everything else is easy, relatively
easy. So, I don't think anything
happened. I think they went in and said,
"We'd really like to talk you in of
having a nuke." And then Iran said,
"We'd really like to keep our nukes
because we don't trust you. We're going
to need one."
I can't I can't possibly imagine that
that's working out. Meanwhile, also the
Ukraine Russia um
negotiations. I don't think anything's
happening. You know, Trump tried to put
a positive spin on it. He goes, I think
Ukraine Russia might be going okay. Uh
you're going to be finding out pretty
soon. I don't think it's going okay.
I I would place a very large bet that
literally nothing
happened because neither side wants
peace. Trump wants
peace, but Ukraine wants to
fight and Russia wants to keep
fighting. So, I don't see how you solve
that. So, I don't think there's going to
be an Iran deal. I don't think there's
going to be a Ukraine Russian deal. I
think they're just gonna keep grinding
at each other and until something
changes. All right, ladies and
gentlemen, if you're joining me late, um
I was confessing early on that I uh
unwisely took a muscle relaxing before
the show. Uh not realizing the cognitive
load that would put on me. So, my brain
not working at all. Not working at all.
And
uh the news is kind of boring, so I
didn't want to, you know, make it last
too long, but I did want to spend some
time with you. So glad you showed up.
This is the conclusion of my short
today, and I'm going to talk to the
locals people privately, the rest of you
on X and YouTube and Rumble. Thanks for
joining. I'll be uh much smarter
tomorrow.
All right, locals coming at Yeah.
