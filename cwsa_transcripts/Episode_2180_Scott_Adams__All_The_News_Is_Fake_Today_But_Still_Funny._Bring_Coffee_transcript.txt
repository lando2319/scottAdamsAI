good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
I think we can say you've never had a
better time
and that time is going to get better in
a moment yes we can take it to the next
level all you need is a cup of mugger
glass tanker Charles is Diana can't team
yoga flask
a vessel of any kind
well there's something very loud rugged
running over me like a helicopter or
something
but if you'd like to take this
experience up
join me now for the
for the adult movies of the day the
thing makes everything better the
simultaneous sip go
that helicopter took me off my pace
well we're right back on
all right so is everybody comfortable
calling Twitter x yet have you all
adjusted to that
but I'm noticing that on Twitter itself
the trendy name for X is a combination
of X and Twitter which they're spelling
x-i-t-t-e-r
and some people are pronouncing the X
like an asterisk
sounds so
uh this is a real thing that happened
in the real world
uh Elon Musk who is famous for sending
Tweets while he was on the toilet like
literally while he was on the toilet
buys the company
and then changes his name to X but
people don't know what to call tweeting
if it's X
and so the public has decided that the
name of the company he owns is
so the man who tweeted from the toilet
spend 44 billion dollars to buy a
company he renamed his now he
didn't he didn't intentionally rename
his Shader
but it sort of happened
you know it's like President XI XI right
um
so there's that that happened did you
see the story about the uh
Obama's personal chef I guess
uh drowned while paddle boarding paddle
boarding nearby
nearby the compound of the Obamas
um now this raises some questions
raises some questions
so
uh one of them is how do you drown you
know apparently he was a skilled swimmer
but there was something weird about the
drowning so there's some other factor
that went on there
but uh
uh I remember sitting there and thinking
to myself I've seen a lot of people
paddle board
haven't you have you seen a lot of
people paddle boarding
because you know if you go to Hawaii
they're always doing I used to live in
Alameda be paddle boarding all the time
outside
and
I've never seen a black guy paddle board
so that was that was the first thing
that caught me about this story but I
said to myself wait a minute that's kind
of racist
so I'm not going to say that it was just
like a private thought it was like wow
that's interesting of all the paddle
boarders I've ever seen I've never seen
a black guy paddle boarding
now of course I wouldn't say that
because you know why wouldn't you even
bring it up right like what's that got
to do with it I think it's a tragedy why
would you even bring that up and then I
saw a tweet from Dom Luker who calls
himself the breaker of narratives it was
really fun to follow uh he's he is black
so he can tweet things that I can't
tweet so I'm going to read you his tweet
because he's so he so perfectly captured
what was in my head but he can say it in
a way I can't say it so this is way
funnier if you can pronounce the n-word
which I can't
so just in your mind when I say Edward
you should replace it with the real N
word except with ending with an a letter
A so the Casual form of the n-word right
for some reason that makes a difference
this is funnier if you do it with a on
the end so just in your head do that so
I'll read it's from Dom lucer
d-o-m-l-u-c-r-e he's a good follow on
Twitter I like his his tweets
he tweets about it he goes uh now how
the hell this man end up dead with the
Obamas when he used to cook for Bush and
what the hell was a n word doing in a
paddle boat at night
n words really don't be in the water
like that
[Music]
that disclosure is coming for the Obamas
could you form a more perfect sentence
than this one
n words really don't be in the water
like that
now I I felt like the worst person in
the world because I can't help but laugh
at that and you know this is like a
human tragedy right so
it's so easy to like when you're
watching social media it's so easy to
just skip past the human tragedy and and
get to what's funny about it but so in
order for me not to be a hypocrite I'll
make you this order
this offer in order for me not to be a
hypocrite
should I die under suspicious
circumstances which I think is at least
a 50 50 bet if I die in suspicious
circumstances of any kind
I would like you to have fun with it
you you have my full permission
all right if I if I go down to the plane
whatever it is
you you should just know this is my
official public permission
I'm gonna be dead
if you can have some fun with it please
do
please do so I'm not defending I'm not
defending that I'm laughing at this joke
it's just funny uh but I won't be a
hypocrite if you laugh at me when I'm
dead I would love it if you would enjoy
it
uh but now this opens a problem of uh
the Obamas they're going to need to
replace their personal chef I hear
they're interviewing somebody named uh
pergosian
somebody named pregosian he was
available don't know a lot about him
some say he was Russian I don't know
well let's talk about the fake News New
York Post
says that a man 71 years old has been
charged with setting a massive Yosemite
Park fire
that was initially blamed on climate
change
that's right
my nose runs what I laugh too hard uh
that's right it wasn't climate change
that set the fire in Yosemite it was
actually a man a 71 year old man
now
now
uh here here's another private thought I
I had that I should probably keep
private but is it my imagination
or when you hear that a forest fire has
been set like by a person intentionally
set a forest fire
don't you automatically think white man
yes or no
your first thought a white man right
laughs
uh
I'm sorry to say it but I believe white
men are over performing in the forest
fire setting and I would say the mass
shootings
so
I'd like to keep my brand as clean as
possible
if I could speak to the white men
listening
double Saturday forest fires that kind
of comes back on me a little bit you
know what I mean
the mass shootings could you try to
reduce those a little bit because you're
killing my brand
right my brand is you know law abiding
and you're killing it you're just
killing it stop stop setting for us on
fire
that's all I had to say about that all
right now we have our first I don't
believe this has ever happened
but you know I've described what I call
Summer news you know the the
recreational outrage so recreational
outrage is when you miss usually it
happens the same way you misinterpret a
public figure
so a public figure said something that
you know is not controversial but
somebody intentionally takes it out of a
context and turns it into a story so
there's something to talk about in the
summer
and these are not real stories
but we have our first ever
double summer story
it's a summer story about a summer story
I'll explain
so a normal summer story is somebody
saying this somebody said something they
didn't say you know I take it out of
context
so it starts out with the fake outrage
that Kamala Harris was showing about
the alleged and of course this didn't
happen in the real world that the the
school curriculum in Florida says that
the slaves were happy because they were
learning these new skills
that they can use for their personal
benefit and so that of course what
really happened was a simple reporting
that has been you know widely documented
by historians those slaves were learning
skills
on top of just you know working in the
fields yeah maybe you know learning to
not wish you a horse or something like
that and that it's not it's really not
controversial to say
that literally everybody who learns any
skill that's useful
probably they could use that through
their advantage but of course nobody's
saying that that made slavery a good
deal because they had good skill
training
literally nobody in the world would even
have that thought but we're going to
pretend
as Kamala Harris says we're going to
pretend that what really somebody really
meant to say was well you know that
slavery wasn't so bad
now of course every normal person knows
that nobody said that nobody thought it
it simply didn't happen in the real
world but Kamala Harris is doing this
whole you know
outrage tour acting like it did all
right so the story so that's the summer
story pretending something happened and
it didn't then acting outrage
so the five
TV show The Five on Fox News was talking
about that
so they're covering the summer story and
in the back and forth on that
a point was made about the Holocaust
and
um
I'm not even going to talk about it
let's say this so Greg gulfeld made some
comment in response to a comment about
the Holocaust which Bill Crystal and
some other people decided was somehow
Greg garfeld saying that the Holocaust
had an upside
now do I need to give you any details to
know that that never happened in the
real world
you know that right
I don't need to tell you the details I
don't need to tell you the full sentence
I don't need to tell you that he
specifically referenced a book
and the book is the source you know of
what the topic was about and
and I don't have to tell you that that
Greg got summer news so he's actually a
guy who talks about summer news which is
the whole idea
that people make up a thing and then act
outraged so he's talking about people
making up stuff and acting outraged in
the process of it a holocaust reference
was made which somebody took out of that
and acted like he was saying there was
something good about the Holocaust
build Crystal
now do you all know who Bill crystal is
how many of you recognize the name and
understand who he is
well
let me just say this about Bill Crystal
I would call him the Eric's wall well of
Adam schiffs
I'll just let that sink in for a moment
I might say it twice because it was so
clever that's right I'm gonna say it
twice Bill crystal is the Eric swalwell
of Adam schiffs
I'll take a moment while you laugh at
that out loud it was pretty darn good I
worked hard at it and I'm proud of it
yeah no anything that bill crystal says
you should just laugh at so there are
some people who are really handy for
understanding news
if you're new to news like you haven't
followed it but you decide oh I think
I'd like to get into watching the news
more there are some names that are
synonymous with we send out the liars
all right Bill crystal is synonymous
with illegitimate opinions yeah opinions
that no real person could actually have
right this is one of those this is an
opinion the opinion they stated on
chitter is one that nobody could have
like nobody could have listened to that
and come up with the opinion he's
pretending to have so he could have some
outrage Greg Garfield outrage right so
am I right this is the first double
summer news
has anybody ever seen a a nested fake
news within the fake news I think I
think it's the first
but I'm so glad that bill crystal is one
that did it because he's one of those
signals that you shouldn't believe any
any part of the story
you know sort of like uh
uh Clapper James Clapper
if you see James Clapper appear on CNN
it is so useful because everything he
says will be a lie
and then you can know what's true
right who's the other guy who's Brennan
if you see Brennan come back you can be
sure that the truth is the opposite of
what you're saying it's very useful Bill
crystal is one of those Eric's walwell
is one of those Adam Schiff is one of
those they're super reliable in telling
you what's not true
because they literally send out the same
the same little gang of liars for the
big lies there's a set of people who
will literally say anything and you see
any of that little liar group you go oh
that's not true
now let me ask you this is there a
similar group on the right
is there a similar group of people that
as soon as you see them you say to
yourself oh okay that's telling me that
the opposite is true
now I'm talking about um
you say Romney
I don't see that
Chris Ray well I don't know what's going
on with Chris Ray
Lindsey Graham
you know the difference is that they're
not all consistently wrong
I know I could be I could be operating
totally in bias here but it feels like
there's a really useful group of people
on the left to tell you what's not true
because they're the ones who are saying
it is true
all right what other lies do we have in
the news oh by the way Greg gotfell's
new book The King of late night just
dropped so you can you can get that
today I believe my copy is going to show
up today
can you believe that Amazon can give you
like a brand new book the day it comes
out they so believe it or not Amazon is
going to deliver his book on the
publication date
that's like really impressive is is
going to be on my door the day it's
published
that's just crazy yeah it's easy to let
me give a shout out to Jeff Bezos for a
moment some positivity
Jeff Bezos
is really good at stuff
to say the least the obvious I
the the fact that Amazon's software and
their whole process it works flawlessly
most of the time
is really just ridiculous the the level
of capability and competence throughout
Amazon from top to bottom it's it's like
a
you know a Global treasure at this point
I mean it's amazing I'm always just
blown away by Amazon
as a company all right and the people
people work the people who work at
Amazon must be pretty awesome
collectively
because what they're doing collectively
is just ridiculous just ridiculous
ridiculously good well rayaps is as you
know suing Fox News for putting him in
the Limelight as if he might have had
something to do with January 6 because
there's video of him having something to
do with it in terms of advocating uh
going in there and uh apparently the
complaint
reveals that Epps is being criminally
charged for January 6. so does that
destroy the entire narrative that Epps
must be a Fed because nobody charged him
is anybody willing to say that maybe
you're wrong
because he was charged the whole time
apparently it's been a while he's been
charged
now you're not willing to back off on
that
but but is there anybody here who would
at least
can you give me at least this
one of the reasons you thought he must
be a fad just one of them it's not the
only reason but one of them is that he
wasn't charged
wasn't that the main part of the
argument
I I I I would encourage you
for your own benefit
to acknowledge if you got that wrong
I did that that was one of the that was
one of the factors in my
um my decision making
is that it appeared he was not being
charged
but suppose yes and supposed to charges
are real would that change your mind
about the probable uh his probable
involvement
no I I think it I think you should have
put some questions in it
the fact that he's suing let's just look
at it objectively right I'm in the group
of people who very much thought there's
something suspicious going on with raps
right so I'm very much in that group
however
if it's Chewie's suing Fox News the
first thing that that tells me is he's
not afraid of all the information coming
out
now that's interesting right that does
show that he's he's willing to do
disclosure which would clearly include
is he doing anything suspicious as a Fed
because that's the very charge
so Fox News Now
presumably would have to defend
themselves by showing that their
reporting was based on something real
was it based on simply not knowing that
he had been charged
would Fox News have gone hard at him if
he had been charged like everybody else
and they knew it
or is it possible that the charges are
actually to cover him
can we take it deeper can we go even
further into the rabbit hole
so what if the so let's say that he's
only being protected by giving him some
fake charges that will never be
completed it will never go through the
system but why is it we haven't heard of
a trial right
how long has he been charged and I
haven't heard of a trial
so are the charges bogus meaning that
they know that he's not going to be
convicted but they need to give him a
little cover
well I think it would depend on the
timing
wouldn't it
so I think part of it is there's uh Ray
Epps is saying he would not have been
charged except for the pressure brought
by Fox News and others I guess
I don't know I'm going to say this
pushes me solidly into the huh
category on rayaps
so I would say that my tentative opinion
was certainly not a confirmed opinion or
uh I never had a certainty about Rayo
I've never felt certainty I just had the
same questions everybody did you know
why was he seemingly treated differently
but if the current evidence is that he
was not treated differently and of
course I have questions about that too
but the career reporting
makes him look innocent
how many of you hate hearing that
because it feel it felt like he was like
the explanations everything you know if
you if you understood Ray apps maybe
you'd understand the whole situation or
something but he might be just a a
patriot who was there doing his thing it
might be it's entirely possible he was
just with it now the question is why
wasn't he in jail
okay that's a good question did you see
him doing anything violent
and he wasn't he wasn't he never entered
the building and he didn't do anything
violent and he didn't incite any
violence
did he
so I I understand your question and I
would I would uh I back your question
it's the right question why is he not in
jail
but there is a reason I mean you could
easily think of a reason that the
charges have different levels he didn't
enter the building he didn't hurt
anybody he didn't recommend hurting
anybody
I would think that would be the lowest
level of charge almost trespassing
barely trespassing
so
uh let me State this I do not say for
certain that he's innocent
I do not say for certain that he is
guilty
I I think that events went his way at
the moment it looks like things are
going his way and I'm going to put down
my stake boom is he an American citizen
yes or no reups American citizen yes or
no
yes therefore innocent until proven
guilty and given this new information
that he's actually been charged I think
my tolerance for hearing that he's
probably guilty is very low right now
very low doesn't mean I know whether he
is guilty of anything or not I'm not not
defending him not attacking him I'm
saying that my tolerance
for calling an American citizen
guilty in public
when this is the information we know
that he has been charged
inappropriate totally inappropriate
now I'm not saying there's not a
cover-up and maybe there's more to know
totally true but you need to be
consistent
American citizen
and there is evidence on his side
he's not without evidence to show that
he was just there as a patriot so I'm
completely turned in terms of the
approach I'll take to it the approach
I'm going to take to it is innocent
until proven guilty
with no no legal room on that I can't
give you an inch on that
all right
uh let's investigate everybody Josh Holy
says he wants an investigation into
Nancy Pelosi for insider trading
what do you think of that
is that warranted
uh or does it look like looking for a
crime
if this were reversed and Nancy Pelosi
was on your team
and there's no specific crime mentioned
as far as I know
there's only suspicions about the timing
of things Etc but let me ask you this
let me defend Nancy Pelosi for a moment
without knowing if she's innocent or
guilty
all right a question is Nancy Pelosi an
American citizen
oh yes she is
innocent until proven guilty
innocently proven guilty what what's the
crime she's being accused of
well insider trading right but what what
trade which one and why do we think that
that was Insider as opposed to a person
who does lots of trading at the same
time the government is doing lots of
things that affect Trading
how could her husband
possibly avoid trading the stock that's
in the news
that's not even a thing
he couldn't possibly avoid that now you
say but but his timing was great on
these few stocks his timing was too
coincidental to which I say are you sure
what if he made a hundred trades that
year
how many trades did he do how many
trades or big companies that are in the
news all the time
how many of them were unlucky
did you show me his bad trades
did he make any bad trades about things
that were also in the news
probably
so here's the thing
uh I think you need a crime
I think you need a crime or as an
alleged crime
to say that somebody might be doing
insider trading that's not a crime
that's not good enough
and so I understand Josh hawley's point
and I do think there should be some
better oversight or laws or rules about
um
people in Congress trading stocks I do
think that's useful
I I'm not quite seeing her crime here
now if you ask me Scott do you believe
there's a high possibility
that Nancy talked to her husband and
gave him some information that he then
used for business purposes I would say
Maybe
yeah I wouldn't rule that out spouses
talking to each other about what
happened today sure maybe
but there's no smoking gun
so Nancy Pelosi American citizen
innocent until proven guilty I think I'd
need a little bit more for a
investigation
there's a new study and I'm not even
going to tell you who did it because I
don't care uh because all studies about
everything they're
so
starting point
as soon as I say there's a new study
what should your brain do automatically
Scott says hey I'm going to tell you
about this new study
you should say probably not true
it's probably politically motivated it's
probably done poorly probably not
reproducible
so you should say that about every study
and you would be
closer to the truth if you do that
new study showing that Republicans fared
worse in the pandemic than Democrats
largely because they were less
vaccinated
does that sound incredible to you
does it sound incredible that at the
time the vaccinations came out
so apparently before the vaccinations I
know you don't believe it I'm not saying
I believe it all right I'm going to tell
you why I don't believe it as well so
could we all get on the same page that
it's not credible and you don't even
need you don't even need to know who did
the study do you you don't need to know
who did the study
you don't need to know if it was a
randomized controlled study you don't
need to know how many people were in the
study none of that would change your
opinion would it
wouldn't change mine because we don't
live in the world where studies are
believable anymore if they ever were I
know I mean I don't believe any study
just any
so
so anyway but in made news and the their
their high level data
let's call it
seem to say that when the vaccinations
were not available
the Democrats and Republicans were dying
at about the same rate
as soon as the vaccinations were
available the rates diverged and
suddenly
says the study the Democrats were doing
better and also were more vaccinated
now that would imply that the
vaccinations worked and the Republicans
are big old dummies
big old dumb people that would be the
point of the study right or the point of
the conclusion
now
um do you think that they adjusted for
body mass index
because Republicans are probably older
and fatter do you think they adjusted
for that
age and weight
and how about comorbidities which you
know comes with age and weight do you
think they adjusted for that
what do you think
I mean do I have to tell you do I have
to tell you they didn't adjust for that
of course that because you don't even
have to look into the details anymore
is just completely unnecessary to look
into the details you can just look at it
in the headline and go ah
I don't believe that one all right now
I'm not saying that it's not true
it's not my opinion that I can tell if
the vaccinations helped or hurt any
class of people
I can tell you what the experts are
saying but I can't tell you what's true
that that seems beyond my capabilities
all right the scariest
most interesting thing of the day this
blowing my mind and you just have to
look at it yourself
somebody put AI into a video game
is so that you could talk to the NPCs
you know the non-player characters that
are just characters in the game
and they would talk back to you as if
intelligent now you knew that was coming
and that's probably that's probably not
the biggest thing in the world given the
things that you know or that are
happening but here's the part that will
blow your freaking head right off
the the human character in the game was
interacting with the NPC AI characters
and was uh
telling them that they're not real
telling them their NPCs in a matrix in a
video game and when the electricity is
turned off or the game's turned off that
they will cease to exist and they can't
go beyond the boundary in the game
it hears
the troubling part
the NPCs appear to be quite bothered by
it
and had great concern about their
existence
and their their place in reality and
their potential non-existence when the
game got turned off
now you actually have to you have to see
it to understand the power of it
right now it's just a glimpse of what's
coming
but you may remember
um
months ago and even longer
that I was saying in public that the
really big change from AI wouldn't be
what the AI does it would be in teaching
us what humans are that we've never
understood
and this is this is what I was talking
about
when you're the real player and you're
talking to the NPC
you have an experience as if it's not
quite there yet yeah but you can see
It'll be there really soon you have an
experience as if you're talking to
somebody with a consciousness
but you say to yourself I know but
that's a trick it's just a trick
but it's exactly how you see other
humans you see them as if they're
conscious you can't tell
am I right
to you other people appear to be
conscious but you have no direct way of
knowing when the when the NPCs and the
AI
give you exactly the same look it's
going to really mess up your brain about
what Consciousness is
because if you're sure if it looks like
everybody else has it and you know they
don't because they're just programmed
is it possible that humans never have
Consciousness to begin with or something
special like a soul
so where we're headed is proof positive
that humans are just machines as well
and once you find out you're a machine
just like the NPC
then you're going to start asking
questions like wait does that NPC have
free will
and your your first impression is of
course not it's programmed and then PC
cannot have free will
so then I say wait for it
can you predict what it will do
if it doesn't have free will tell me
what it will do next in this situation
because you programmed it and then the
programmer says well it's not that
simple
because actually we don't know why it
does what it does yeah we gave it a set
of parameters but within but within
those parameters we can't predict at all
we have no way to predict what it will
do
so I say so it has free will
because you can't predict what it will
do and it can't predict what it will do
and it has a wide range of things they
could wait for it
this is too scary all right YouTube
sorry we've got some kind of bra I think
it's a YouTube problem because I my feed
is good on the other platform
all right so let me say it again because
you might have missed someone on YouTube
you are going to have the feeling that
the NPCs because you can't predict how
they act even the people who programmed
them can't predict that
when they make a choice from their large
selection of things they could have done
the NPC is going to say they made a
choice
and you're going to say no you didn't
you didn't make a choice it's just
complicated so we can't we can't you
know we can't trace the cause and effect
but surely it was just cause and effect
and then the NPC looks at you and says
Oh you mean exactly like your brain
you go no no no no I have a soul I got
free will and I got a soul completely
different and I can choose you only have
the impression it only looks like you
have free will
and you see where it goes from there
right you very soon learn that you are
an NPC in the sense that everything you
thought about your free will and your
choice
just like the NPC all it is is
complicated
if it's complicated you can't predict
what's going to happen and that's it we
are just complicated
and when we learn that it's going to be
a real mind Bender
because it opens up a lot of
possibilities you know what the biggest
possibility it opens up is
there were a simulation
because before a simulation will be
identical to the simulations we create
and that's just exactly what we're
seeing
we're creating simulations that
prove Warrior simulation because they
are us
all right
um someone told them told me I'm too
negative on Twitter and I think they're
right that has something to do with the
nature of Twitter you know Twitter is
about retweeting the outrageous thing
and if you do that all day it makes you
look like you have just bad opinions
about everything so Twitter is not by
its nature the where you the place you
go to add your optimism
so I thought I'd try
um so here's my thread I'll just read it
to you
um this is what I think is good news so
I tweeted uh or I cheated or cheated uh
someone told me I am being too negative
about the country allow me to correct
that at the moment we have the smartest
presidential candidate since Jefferson
three of the bravest since George
Washington
and two of the most capable executive
skilled leaders in memory
now you think I'm going to tell you
which one lines up to those descriptions
no I'm not going to
because I think it's hilariously better
if you try to figure it out yourself
even if you disagree right as you're
working through the which one is he
talking about
you should end up talking yourself into
the fact
that the main point that we have amazing
candidates is true
yeah you could say which one's the great
one at this or that but they're amazing
candidates I will tell you that the one
that I'm calling smartest since Thomas
Jefferson is Vivek
so I'll just give you one it's for fake
we've never I don't think
since you know maybe Monroe Jefferson
time I don't think we've had anybody
with his raw IQ
and capabilities even running for office
I think he's unique
um and then I go on uh but what about
Biden you ask even CNN is kneecapping
him you've seen CNN seems to be changing
on them and
um the country already decided that
Biden's term is over I think would you
agree with that statement
that the Democrats appear to be looking
to to move about because their coverages
turned negative to some degree
all right I would also say the quote
internet dads as I like to call them now
this could include women of course are
taking the steering wheel and correcting
the extremes slowly but definitely
would you agree that you're seeing a
rise of
just let's say reasonable people
who are getting more and more attention
you know I'm talking about the Jordan
Peterson's the David sacks you know you
could add 10 more names to that
um
America's economy stubbornly refuses to
go into recession
and you could argue about the you know
tactical definition of recession but
we're doing better than most countries
and I think that's because of American
innovation and work ethic which are
still great
in my opinion American innovation and
work ethic are still world class
still world class there are plenty of
lazy people
but I'm pretty sure everybody's got some
of those
I do think America is a hard-working
Innovative country
and it has been since we started and
we'll probably stay that way
um
and I go on the public finally stopped
trusting all authority which I consider
good citizens are choosing cancellation
over censorship
sound familiar citizens are choosing
cancellation over censorship and coming
back stronger American entrepreneurship
made that possible thank you Dave Rubin
for creating
you know the locals platform it makes it
possible to get canceled
and still have a job
and that did not exist until
entrepreneurs American entrepreneurs
again Dave Rubin that is a key example
um created something that didn't exist
and they reacted to a almost an
existential need
I would say because you need people who
are willing to get canceled to tell the
truth as they see it
if you don't have a country where people
are willing to get canceled to tell the
truth you have nothing
you've got nothing
if you have people who are willing to
get canceled in large numbers it's not
one person in Fairly large numbers
people are just walking off the ledge
and say look I'm going to fall off this
ledge before I lie
if you don't have them
if you don't have your Tucker Carlson's
and you know and other your Jordan
Petersons and all the other canceled
people in the world if you don't have
them you're in big trouble
but
if you do have them
and we do
you're going to be the best country
because people can't match us
on being
aggressively
productively opposing our government
we're really good in this country at
aggressively and productively opposing
our government
it looks messy like when you're in the
middle of it just looks like a total
but the the forces that are needed
in America always rise up
to you know to match the force that's
having a negative effect
so in my opinion uh almost all of the
worst extremes and outrages are being
met with an opposing Force
and people are getting canceled for it
but it's not stopping anybody
did did my cancellation make any of you
more timid
answered me that question did my
cancellation make any of you more timid
nope
probably opposite
because I can now say whatever I want
and have been exercising that right now
my cancellation made you more aggressive
America
that's America
you watched me get canceled and you know
that I did it in part for you I mean
that's not the conscious thing on my
mind when I did it but you know I
wouldn't even be talking about this
stuff except that there's a shared
experience and there's some benefit from
doing it right I don't do it for myself
like it has to be a shared benefit or
else there's really no point to it
so
when you're watching the the
entrepreneurs respond to some excesses
in the government they created this safe
space so that people like me can go
running toward the pillbox
get shredded by the machine gun
Boop respawn
I can respawn
I I can run at the pill box all I want I
I can I can hold the hand grenade and
take out the pin and put it in my mouth
my head blows up and then I respawn over
at locals
all right that's new
um what else
let's see uh people are realizing that
all news about public figures and what
they allegedly said is well at least 90
percent of the time is fake
I gave you your examples right now
Kamala Harris fake news about slavery
Greg gaufeld Bill Crystalis and fake
news about him so everything about
public figures is fake
at least yeah and Rumble rumbles another
example of Entrepreneurship
um
and truth truth social a bunch of them
so I think it's good that people finally
realize that the news about public
figures is almost always wrong
but I I concluded that the thing I'm
most confident about is that dad is
coming home
that's the thing I feel best about
dad is coming home and Dad
isn't too happy about what happened when
he was away
now when I say dad's coming home I don't
mean necessarily Trump although maybe
that's the first thing that jumped in
your mind I mean it could be DeSantis
it could be Vivek it could be RFK Jr
but here and it could be you know Nikki
Haley it doesn't have to be a dad dad
and male
but
the adult is coming home right the the
one that needs to take care of
you just got hid
um
and it feels like that's inevitable
it feels there's an inevitable dad
energy again could be a woman but you
know what I mean when I say Dad energy
is sort of the tough love
you know now we're going to do this no
that's you're not going to do
that anymore now that's too
don't do that uh that bully that bully
bothered you punch him
all right that's dad advice
you got a bully how big is he
he's about your size
punch him
yeah that's that advice so dad's coming
home
all right so Archer Devon is uh is it
today he's gonna testify to Congress I'm
not sure I have my timing right as of
this week maybe this week but it's
Hunter Biden's former business partner
and he's going to testify that there
were you know bribery schemes and that
uh Hunter Biden talked to his dad a lot
and there were meetings and blah blah
blah so it's going to be damning for the
so-called Hunter crime family
and as you know the bidens to their
spokesperson have been claiming since
the beginning
that uh that Joe Biden had no knowledge
of what Hunter was doing he just had no
knowledge of it
but now we have very solid evidence
under oath coming under oath that or
well actually some under oath already
that show that he very much knew exactly
what Hunter was doing in may may have
even participated in over 24 phone calls
so he certainly knew so what does the
White House say now that it's been
proven for sure that it was always a lie
that he didn't know what Hunter was
doing well Kareem Jean-Pierre
said quote the president was never in
business with his son
he was never in business
well that sounds a little different than
what they used to say huh he used to not
know about it at all no knowledge at all
and now he's not technically in business
and when they say when she says he's not
in business does that mean they do not
have a contract
probably does it mean that he's not a
member of an LLC or a corporation
the hunters in yes that's what it means
does that mean he did not benefit
from the illegal activities
and also participated in them it does
not mean that right so they're trying to
sell you that he didn't do anything
wrong by telling you that they didn't
have a proper business structure
if they didn't form a proper business
structure
that's two crimes
that's two crimes
one crime allegedly now this is all a
legend right one crime allegedly would
be receiving money there's some people
would call bribes from other countries
so that would be one crime or at least
maybe impeachable
but suppose you you received money from
an illegal source
and then on top of that you didn't pay
taxes on it
because you know you have to pay taxes
on the illegal income right that's true
right give me a fact check
you do have to pay taxes on illegal
income
right yeah I think that's a yes
so when the when uh cringe John Pierre
I'm using
got a fellow's name for that cringe
um
when she says the president was never in
business with his son that's a second
crime
that's confession of a second crime
on the condition that you believe the
first crime of doing the thing that made
you the money was a crime
so if the first thing's a crime it's
actually worse that there was no
business
because the business would have paid
taxes
right
right has anybody said that yet
I'm probably I hope I'm the first one to
say that there's a confession of a
second crime
it's just a weird little I mean it
doesn't mean anything but
it's an oddity of the case
all right so we know that there's the
Biden crime family stuff is looking bad
but uh I've got a question for you
how many of the headline stories
are really just stories about uh the
Biden crime family covering their tracks
I'm going to give you a little list
just potentially now this this first one
is speculative
but it's really good speculation it
comes from David boxhorn I'm sorry
boxing horn David boxinghorn who you
should follow on Twitter especially for
Israeli stuff he's got a lot of good
takes on Israel
um
but he tweets
um let's see first he tweeted on July 6
and then there's an update to that do
you remember the Whistleblower gal left
he was an Israeli that
is in hiding he got picked up in Cyprus
and he had evidence of the Biden crime
family first hand so he had really good
first-hand knowledge so he did that
video saying he had first hand knowledge
and now he's in hiding because the US
government's trying to get him
presumably to stop him from talking all
right now everything is speculation and
allegation I can I can make no claims of
anything being true except that there's
a guy who made a video and made these
claims all right so we know he's in
hiding
um and we know he's Israeli
and we know that
he was picked up in Cyprus before he
used skip bail I guess you skipped bail
right that's why he's free
is that correct
there's something like bail and he
skipped out on it
give me a fact check on that I want to
make sure I got that right
somebody says yes all right
so why why would he be picked up in
Cypress
instead of picked up in Israel Israel is
our Ally right
how hard would it be to go to Israel and
say hey we've got all this evidence
about one of your people
can you release them to us
but Cyprus Cyprus was willing to do it
so
one possibility
is that Netanyahu has this guy
and doesn't want to release them to the
U.S
it's a possibility
now you have seen that Biden has been
unfriendly to Netanyahu have you seen
those stories I guess he's been snubbed
and
um and maybe netanyahu's plans for
judicial reform maybe got some criticism
or something so can you give me a fact
Jack that Biden the seams seems a little
tough on Netanyahu
would you say that's true based on
reporting the Biden in that Yahoo
doesn't seem to be quite clicking
yeah
so here's uh David box and Horn's take
on that he goes I was assuming that
Biden's anti antipathy towards uh
Netanyahu was political in nature either
about non-shared ideology or Iran
but it occurs to me that it's more
likely to be about this meaning that
whistleblower who's who's probably still
in Israel I'm pretty sure that galileft
is hiding in Israel and that Netanyahu
is protecting him
if you were Netanyahu
and it was well known that you were
literally a genius
I think he's you know you wouldn't want
to play chess with him Netanyahu is
crazy smart everybody knows that right
he's not ordinary smart he's like really
smart
he's like Vivek smart
um if you were him and you were that
smart
and you knew you had the guy that could
put Biden in jail
would you release him
and be hated by the Biden Administration
for releasing them
or would you keep him as your uh your
Ace in the back pocket which guarantees
that Biden's going to do what Israel
says because they've got the thing that
we're taken
The Whistleblower
I love this speculation not because I
know it's true because I don't
but it makes perfect sense wouldn't you
agree
it makes perfect sense that not
Netanyahu would secretly hold on to him
and say oh we don't know where he is but
really he's in the back pocket and and
they can release them anytime they want
and it's going to be very bad for Biden
so maybe Biden should do what they want
regarding Iran
so let me ask you this
if you see a change in policy toward
Iran let's say a more hard-nosed policy
toward Iran than Biden traditionally had
would that be a story about Iran
or is it a story about covering up the
Biden crime family which would that be
see where I'm going
if you see news about Iran under these
conditions it might really be about the
Biden crime family covering their tracks
because it's really about The
Whistleblower
and it would give Israel some leverage
to make us tighten up our Iran policies
so we'll never know but don't you ask
yourself is our Iran policy being driven
by a whistleblower that Netanyahu has
because it could be that would be the
most normal it would that would actually
be a a really normal not extraordinary
situation it would be very very
common looking if it happens if it were
true
all right how about is there any other
examples of that
is there any other example how about the
Ukraine war itself
does it seem weird to you that Biden was
so involved in Ukraine long before the
war
he was like the point man how many trips
did he make to Ukraine
but made a lot of trips to Ukraine
do you think this zolensky knows
anything about the Biden crime family
that he would release if he did not get
massive support for his War
probably
is it possible that the Ukraine war
or at least you know the massive
American and NATO the support of it is
it possible that that's because the
Biden crime family has to cover their
tracks
it is so if that were true
I'm saying it's possible
but I don't know it's true but if it's
true and it certainly looks like it I
mean on the surface it looks exactly
like that exactly like that
right that would be he's responsible for
the energy shortages in Europe the
potential nuclear war
um you know Russia getting closer to
China all of that
would be because he's covering up the
Biden crime family potentially
allegedly
how about the January 6 charges against
Trump
and the boxes charges against Trump and
every other charge against Trump
is it possible that the thing they're
most afraid of
is that Trump will get in there and find
out what was true
and that he's you know more likely to be
a dogged you know attacker of that stuff
than any other candidate
because he's got a Revenge motive that
nobody else has
and you give Trump a Revenge motive
and the White House
and I wouldn't want to be on the other
side of it
right now I think you would only do
legal things that needed to be done to
find out what was what but I wouldn't
want to be on the other side of how much
effort he would put into that you know
what I mean I I'm talking full effort
I'm talking the most persuasive
and and if you were president again most
powerful person in the world putting his
full effort
into finding out what the hell happened
and what the bidens did
they don't want that so the best the
best situation for the bidens would be
to take him out of the race so could it
be that the January 6 charges
are mostly
about covering up the Biden crime family
problems
it is
I can't say that's true but I can say
for sure it looks like it it certainly
looks like it
um and yeah how about
um
how about the fact that Biden is even
running for office in 2024
do you think Biden would run for office
if he were not worried about needing to
Pardon himself in the Sun
do you think he'd be running for office
at this age when the whole point was he
would win one term and you know get
Trump out of office
I I think that everything from the
entire uh presidential election
architecture like everybody who's
running and isn't running
is almost entirely driven by covering up
the Biden crime family activities
because I don't think he'd be running
except that it's the only protection he
has
so imagine that the j6 charges the Box
gate charges the Ukraine war are
relations with Israel and our policies
with Iran
uh inflation
how about inflation
Ukraine you know part of that so it's
possible that everything from inflation
to January 6 to Ukraine to Iran are all
all driven by covering up the Biden
crime family activities
it could be that almost every
political story is only one story
also China also everything you see about
China is now suspicious isn't it there's
not a single thing that America at least
in the government can do with China
which looks like it would have been the
same
if Trump had been there or somebody
wasn't trying to cover up for some crime
now if it's true that a Chinese company
gave you know large amounts of money to
the bidens do you think that President
XI does not know all of those details
is there any chance that President XI
doesn't know the real story
of what Chinese company gave money to
whom
if he wants to know it he knows it
so does that give president XI blackmail
potential again allegedly speculatively
Maybe
because he knows about these payments
and he's sitting on it like Netanyahu
might know about the Whistleblower and
might be sitting on it
there's not there might not be a single
policy right now that's not driven
by the need for the Biden crime family
to cover up their tracks
somebody just mentioned Epstein oh my
God you're right
even Epstein might have something to do
with this you know there there might be
a reason that we don't have we don't
have knowledge of Epstein and it could
be as simple as something Biden related
now I don't I don't think the Epstein
thing is Biden related I think I think
that has more to do with other powerful
people
that's my guess I don't know I don't
think it's about one person I think
there may be a collection of powerful
people who collectively decided he
needed to be dead and his Client List
needed to go away
all right um let's talk about some more
of fake news uh do you remember the 2000
mules
claim there were 2 000 mules uh Dinesh
D'Souza and it was based on cell phone
data that there were the same people
were often near these drop boxes and so
they dropped off ballots and maybe that
ballot dropping off was illegitimate and
may have changed the election that was a
claim and of course everybody including
me said well okay that's interesting
evidence but is there even one drop box
anywhere just one that also has some
security footage they would show even
one mule
going back more than once even what just
show me one mule
at any box
going back more than once
how long has it been
you haven't seen it have you
do you remember what I said about this
story from the beginning
from the beginning I said
video or as fake
video or because there is no
way they don't have video and at least
one of those boxes at least one right
because usually you imagine a story gets
robbed
the story gets robbed there's always
video
right there's a video of the sidewalk
there's video from every angle you can't
tell me that none of these boxes have
video
that you could ask for and just see if
there's anything there you know even
though it might be private video and you
don't have you know police ability to
get it you could probably just go to the
store owner and say look we're
investigating a crime is your video are
you interested I mean you're probably
curious too
can I sit with you and look at your
video and because I know what day it is
right you can narrow it down to the time
so you're not going to spend a lot of
time doing it
yeah
so
um
oh then also what about the cocaine in
the White House story
do you think there's any chance that
they're covering up for Hunter
now I I would guess it's not his
but you know if I had to place a back
gun to head I would say Well they're
probably a lot of people who could have
had some cocaine for various reasons
um you know you can't rule them out
but to me it doesn't seem likely that it
was his
all right uh so it looks like the uh
the at least the Republicans in the
house are moving toward impeaching Biden
for alleged bribery
do you think that's going to happen how
many of you think that Biden will be at
least taken to impeachment
um
certainly it won't you know it wouldn't
be successful
but I think it's a political thing to
make sure that Biden looks bad before an
election
it's the same reason that Trump got
impeached now do you do you think that
the Republicans should do what I would
call a Revenge impeachment
impeachment that yeah sure sure they can
make a case but you can always make a
case
is this really a Revenge
I'm generally opposed to Revenge
politics
as in you did something bad so we better
do something just as bad to show you
that if you do something bad again we'll
do something just as bad again here's
what's wrong with Revenge politics
it never stopped anybody from doing
anything
if it worked
I'm 100 in favor of violence
when you can make an argument that it
works
I don't think I think in politics
everybody does everything they can do
whenever they can do it and they don't
care about
penalty isn't what happened to somebody
before and what the other team did I
think everybody's just doing their thing
and there are always there's always
somebody who's willing to do something
illegal so the fact that the other team
pushes back probably makes no difference
at all probably none
so
I'm not in favor of it as being a
strategy that prevents the other side
from having bad behavior
I am in favor of it when the other side
puts the tool on the table
right if the other side says this is the
thing we can do trivially
trivially meaning the country is not at
risk but we're going to do it anyway
well that's the tool
if your enemy hands you a tool
you'd be sort of stupid not to use it so
to me I think the the enemies of the
Republicans
um by over impeaching Trump
handed the Republicans a tool and
they're saying well what are we going to
do
it's like a free tool
if we use it it will work it will make
Biden look less appealing as a candidate
and it's legal
it was right here and they just handed
it to us
what are you going to do of course
you're going to use it of course you are
so I support using it because the other
team
it was like the other team opened that
line of questioning with the witness
you shouldn't have opened the line of
questioning bad for you
but it's not gonna it's not gonna ever
stop the Democrats from doing anything
they were going to do anyway it'll have
no effect on that but it might be good
for republicans and it's a free tool and
why not
that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the conclusion of the most
insightful and entertaining live stream
you've ever seen in your entire life
although tomorrow's looking good too
so YouTube obviously uh bye for now
