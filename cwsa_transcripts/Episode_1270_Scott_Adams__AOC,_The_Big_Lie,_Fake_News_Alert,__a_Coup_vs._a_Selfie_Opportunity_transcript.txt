come on in come on in happy groundhog
day
probably one of the best holidays of the
whole year
yeah groundhog day a lot of people like
their christmas
they like their fourth of july but i'm
kind of a groundhog day
kind of a guy all the way and uh
you know it's groundhog day because once
again
they're trying to impeach president
trump as they do every year
at this time it's groundhog day
i stole that joke from joel pollock on
twitter he uh
he i've been laughing all morning about
how our government
has somehow become like groundhog day
and i'm thinking if you were to describe
a government
that was not doing his job and you were
trying to pick the right
movie well you might go with the
idiocracy
but groundhog day would be a good one
and if you'd like to enjoy this
groundhog day to its
maximum potential and i know you do
what do you need be hot besides a
groundhog i mean you're going to need at
least one groundhog
but you also need a copper mug or glaze
attacker tells you sign a canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
not with a groundhog no they don't
belong in a copper mug or glass
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the double until the day i
think makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip go
i think we got the simultaneity right
sometimes i'll be off half a beat but no
this time i nailed it nailed it
all right what else is going on uh
according to
rasmussen poll two-thirds of voters
roughly say that insiders manipulate the
stock market
what two-thirds of citizens
i guess it doesn't matter doesn't matter
if you lean left or lean right
the number's about the same two-thirds
of the citizens think the
stock market is rigged
or at least that's being manipulated by
insiders and here's the
funny part who are the one-third
who are the one-third of this public who
don't think
insiders are manipulating the stock
market
who are these people who believe the
stock market is fair
um andy no you know andy no
spelled g-n-o you've seen lots of his
videos of
antifa and he's got a new book coming
out that
antifa and his haters would like to
cancel
so here's andy now reporting on very
important
stuff of great national interest the
anti-fa
uh situation had i think he was driven
out of the country
uh threatened and now he's got a book
his book is called uh unmasked
you can find just just google unmasked
and andy no ngo and this is me
buying his book boop placing my order
on amazon done
whenever there's a book that somebody's
trying to ban
or or a person or a product uh i'm just
going to automatically buy it
so that's going to be my new habit i'm
not going to i'm not going to look at
the description of the product
if it's something you know in in the
consumer level of expense
i'm just going to buy it it's just going
to be automatic and
i think andy's book was already number
54
on amazon's best seller list
do you know how hard it is to be number
54
on amazon's best seller list it's pretty
hard
it's pretty hard but let's see if we can
get him to number one
he's number one in all of the important
political categories
but let's see if we can get him number
one on all of amazon
and maybe in the future
there will be people who say to
themselves hey
maybe we should boycott this product or
this book
and the moment they say it that should
make the person who made that book or
product
rich you should get rich
as a result of people trying to cancel
you
i can't make it happen myself but i can
buy their products
and if you do as well let's see if we
can push andy up to number one
on principle alone freedom
yeah goya beans i also bought the
goya mexican food products
that i don't think i ever ate i think i
put it in the
cupboard but the moment i heard that he
was going to get canceled the
ceo of goya foods i said well i'm going
to get me some of that
i went directly to the store and bought
a bunch of his products
so that's my new habit if you like
freedom
maybe it could be your habit too
aoc is making news as she is so good at
doing she did a
live stream i think it was on instagram
and
she talked about her her
experience during the capital assault
and that she was afraid for her life and
she said i guess the first time in
public she said that she was a survivor
of
sexual abuse now
i say this often much to your chagrin
the same standard that i used for trump
i applied to
aoc that's fair right same standard
and the standard is you might like or
not like
his or her policies but if we could just
look at their technique
their persuasion technique how they
communicate
oh my god they're good right and aoc is
you know she wouldn't want to hear this
but she is sort of the female trump
probably the last thing she'd want to
hear but in terms of technique
it's just a plus just consistently a
plus
just for technique you don't have to
like her policies right
separate decision but this doing a live
stream
which is exactly the right way to do it
uh combining her story of you know her
personal trauma with
surviving sexual abuse you could argue
that doesn't belong in the story
about the capital assault but she made
it belong
she she made it fit and
technique-wise it's just really good
like you could you could put yourself in
the scene
you could feel it you probably connected
it to something you've experienced
before if you're a woman
chances are you've had some you know
ugly sexual
situation in your past most do
unfortunately
so technique-wise it was freaking good
all right gotta say that it was good
technique-wise but that's not the only
thing to consider
she is uh perpetuating what i call the
big lie
now the big lie is that the election
was known to be transparent and free of
fraud
that's not true what we do know
is that no widespread fraud was
recognized by any court
that's also true right that's true
there's no court that recognized any
widespread fraud in the election
so we can say that unambiguously because
no matter what
did or did not happen in the election
it's just a fact
that no court ruled
or or acknowledged any widespread fraud
now it's worth saying that the court is
not the right tool for that
it is also true that there is no toaster
that solved world peace do you know why
well toasters don't do that that's not
one of the things a toaster does
a toaster is pretty good at making toast
except for mine i don't only make toast
on one side but that's just my problem
um so
it doesn't mean anything that the courts
have not found any widespread fraud but
it's still a fact
it's not a meaningful fact because it's
the wrong the wrong place to look for
fraud
but uh that's all we have so they use
that
so the big lie is that the election was
definitely
definitely and we know it and we've
confirmed it
fair and free um
and the second part of that big lie is
that there was something called a coup
or uh insurrection that happened at the
capitol
which as far as i can tell did not
happen
i'm watching the same news that
everybody else's app is watching and
i didn't see it but she reports it as if
it's true
now here's what i find is most
interesting
what would have happened and nobody
there's nobody
who wants this to happen but what would
have happened
if the uh the rioters the
people that are being called the
insurrectionists what if they had found
aoc that night
what if aoc had actually been
let's say surrounded by the
insurrectionists
well her opinion and i
i don't have any you know proof that
she's wrong
is that she would have been in great
danger physical danger
and i can't rule that out i mean if you
have a big
unwieldy crowd and uh you know some of
them have clubs and
whatnot you can't rule out that she
would have been in big trouble
so it makes sense that she would have
seen it that way
and treated it that way and i wouldn't
wanted her to have treated it any other
way
but i think there's a blind spot here
and again safety first so she should
definitely
have you know tried to get to safety
period
but i don't think aoc understands her
own
power i don't think she understands her
power
and maybe that's good because if she
ever understood it she'd probably use it
more
but here's what i think i think if aoc
had simply walked into the middle of the
crowd
she would have been perfectly safe
that's what i think
now and i think that the crowd would
have respected her
and they would have stopped they
wouldn't have stopped everything they're
doing
but they would have stopped and listened
and i think if anybody in that crowd had
tried to mess with her
like physically i think other people in
the crowd would have taken them out
instantly
that's what i think i don't think this
crowd
was going to let a woman get hurt
right in front of them you know and
certainly not
as the agent of that of that trouble
that that is a complete misreading of
the crowd
i believe now was mike
pence in any danger
he might have been because they were
calling for him by name
because he was on their team and wasn't
doing what they wanted
now what would the crowd do if they saw
somebody who's known to be on the other
team
and playing for the other team i think
they would have said
oh you're okay you're doing exactly what
the other team does
if the situation were reversed we would
probably be you
they were mad at mike pence for not
doing what they
imagined he could or should do i don't
know if he could have done it
but i don't think this was about
democrats i don't think that anybody who
entered that building
wanted to do anything bad to ada i won't
say anybody
because it was a big crowd you only need
one person who has you know
a crazy idea for trouble to happen so
like i said for sure they should have
treated it like a deadly risk
for sure she had a reason to be scared
i i can definitely see how that would
connect to any past
experiences of trauma and so i think she
played it honestly and
and i think that she's effective as she
often is
but she definitely underestimates her
personal power
i think she could have walked into the
middle of that crowd
and they would have stopped and they
would have listened
and they would have protected her now i
wouldn't take the chance
so it'd be stupid to try to test this
theory
i just think she has way more power than
she knows
and maybe that's good all right
um but she's part of the big lie that
there was something called
a coup or an insurrection and that
and that's what was actually going on um
meanwhile because the simulation loves
us
this big simulation we're in with its
code reuse and its weird coincidences
and it's
irony that it serves up so frequently
well it's serving up some irony over in
myanmar
that fox news calls burma
i still don't know why i don't know why
the news calls it two different
countries
i'm sure there's a reason but the cnn is
reporting that
the biden administration they can't
decide if they want to call the
armed military takeover of the civilian
government
in myanmar as a coup or not
let me say that again because you'll
think you missed something in the
sentence
no you didn't miss anything in the
sentence here it is again
the biden administration can't decide
whether the
armed military takeover of the civilian
government
in myanmar is a coup or not
but one thing they're pretty sure about
is that when that guy with the viking
hat and his selfie army went into the
capital
well that's a coup that's a coup and the
way that you can tell
a coup from a
whatever thing is happening in myanmar
that doesn't have a name
the way you can tell is whether there's
a viking hat
if there's a viking hat involved well
that's a coup
but if it's an armed military entering
the capital and taking control of the
government
that's more of a we don't know what that
is really
does it have a name should we give
everything a name
not everything needs a label does it why
can't we just speak of it
as the events that happened so
that's the biden administration selfie
selfie army and viking hat totally a
coup
and let me tell you i'm not i'm not a
military
expert but when you do a coup
you also have to hold the government
it's not enough
that you've captured an empty room oh
that's a good start
once you've captured an empty room well
slippery slope
next thing you know you're going to
capture all the rooms you'll have you'll
have every room in the united states if
we let them have that one empty room
that's that's they're going to own the
government i mean what could we do
you've got a nuclear nuclear option
you've got a very large military and
police force but
i don't know how they're going to have
any hope
of dislodging unarmed people from an
empty room
i mean how would you even begin
so yes we know that the
viking hat guy was a legitimate coup
with a really good chance of controlling
the country that they had conquered
with their hat and their selfies
so that's the big lie anyway
um i would like to go from that which
you all agreed with
at least my audience to something that
you all hate it's why you watch me
come on you know when i do this
you hate it when i disagree with you
but it's also why you watch right you're
looking for the part where i disagree
because that's the only thing
that's the only interesting part right
me just agreeing with us in a fund
you can get that anywhere at the
beginning of the pandemic
i said loudly and often the following
we should not hold our leaders
accountable
for the mistakes they are about to make
with all good intention do you remember
me saying that i said it a lot
like i tried to make a really big point
of it
that before our leaders even started
making decisions
we should forgive them in advance
because nobody knew
the right thing to do nobody knew
and i applied this standard to trump
you know that nobody knew what to do so
if he did something wrong well who knew
but i also apply it to governor cuomo
in new york this is the part you might
not like
governor cuomo is blamed and of course
the top guy
or top top person needs to take the
responsibility because the buck has to
stop somewhere right
so the nursing home deaths are
unambiguously
cuomo's fault if you want to use that
word
it's his responsibility to take care of
his people
there was something that happened that
was clearly the wrong set of decisions
people died cuomo was in charge
that's on his record right so let's
agree
let's agree it was a mistake
so i'm not going to argue that right
clearly it was a mistake
but how exactly did that mistake happen
was there a conversation in which
somebody went to the governor and said
governor as it stands now we would be
putting these people back in rest homes
it's the worst thing you could possibly
do and it will probably
kill all the other people in the rest
home should we go ahead and do that
and then the governor in this
hypothetical said
huh put them back in the rest homes the
very worst place to put them
it'll kill a bunch of other people yeah
let's do that
how did you imagine this happened like
when you play it in your mind of how we
got to that horrible situation of
putting
infected people back in rest homes or
old old people facilities whatever
they're
how did it happen now i wasn't there but
i'm going to make an educated guess
based on being the creator of the
dilbert comic strip
and i know big organizations it probably
happens something like this
there was a process in place according
to governor cuomo the federal government
process
was that those people would go back to
where they came from
and they would do the best job they
could to keep them separated from other
people
now did you know in advance
did you know that if you did that
the infection would definitely spread to
the rest of the people or did you think
to yourself
well i mean it's a professional facility
they're clearly not going to put them in
the same place
with any kind of cross-pollination with
other
people so if you were in that situation
would it have even
occurred to you necessarily to even ask
the right question
if nobody brought it up to you and said
hey
ah this is a special virus i don't think
you could
keep the infected people in one room and
hope that it's not going to get to the
other rooms you know through the ac or
something
and people here are saying yes i knew i
knew that i would not have made that
mistake
and i believe you i believe that some
number of you would not have made that
mistake but remember this was a
bureaucracy
and there was probably a lot of back and
forth with underlings trying to decide
what works and what doesn't
do you think that at some point the
nursing the
old folks homes said
yeah we can handle this
i don't know do you think there were any
people at those facilities who said
absolutely not i realize this is the law
but let me tell you we are not letting
these infected people anywhere near our
property
period that's it they're just now coming
on our property
did they say that or did the old folks
home say
we can make this work you know if you
just give us the ppe
and some extra funding we can make it
work
i don't know that cuomo was ever part of
any of those conversations
i suspect that by the time he got the
information it sounded
more like they think they could work it
out
it's our best option we don't want to
put them in hospitals either
because even putting them in a hospital
is dangerous because the rest of the
hospital
so it's not going to be more or less
dangerous no matter where we put them
we'll just try to handle it right
by the time he heard it if he heard it
at all i don't even know if he was part
of the conversation
but do you think he heard it as if we
put them there the people will die
yes or no
this is where i say this is where you
you have to understand the fog of war
that was happening yet you can't judge
cuomo
by today's standard today we know it was
the biggest mistake
anybody made that's obvious today and
many of you are saying oh boy if i had
been there
if i had been there i wouldn't have made
that mistake and you're probably right
for many of you i'll bet if you had been
in charge
and you had known about this risk i'll
bet you would have played it right
many of you but it's a real
messy world and we ask our leaders to
make decisions on our behalf
that we know aren't going to be right
every time so if you've got somebody who
cares about your well-being and i think
cuomo
does care about your well-being right i
don't believe
that any of our leaders are the type who
literally don't care
like trump cared about people getting
better
the democrats care the republicans care
everybody cares
right so you've got somebody who cares
you got somebody who is doing his
level best i think cuomo put in the time
he put in the effort
he had all the right intentions he's
smart enough
this was a giant mistake despite all of
that
giant mistake but how do you treat him
for this giant mistake i'm going to
treat him the way i started out
by saying we know there are going to be
mistakes this big we knew that
we just didn't know the details but we
knew
there were going to be some big
leadership mistakes it was just baked
into the situation
so my take is this you could reasonably
assume that
cuomo's political career is over
because of it and i don't know that that
would be
wrong because again the person in charge
takes the responsibility no matter what
they knew or didn't know that's just
how the system has to work so there's
probably a penalty
but personally i'm not going to hold it
against him in the same way that i'm not
going to hold
any mistakes that trump made against him
or any other leader because i think
there was too much
uncertainty and i think that they all
had the best
interests of the public in mind so that
would be my charity for the day
that i'd give cormor a break but i
wouldn't ask you to
i'm just giving you my opinion if you
want to be
treat him harshly for that i think that
you can make a good argument for that
all right uh mcconnell is slamming uh
new uh congressperson marjorie taylor
green
for her quote conspiracy theories that
she believes
being a cancer on the gop she mcconnell
didn't mention her by name but everybody
knew who
he was talking about now
if you've looked at some of the things
that she's believed
you can't possibly support that can you
just because she's on your team if
you're a republican
i mean seriously have you looked at the
things that she has believed and said in
public
she uh she does not belong in government
i mean she really really doesn't belong
in the government
so i'm hoping republicans can fix that
because they're just shooting themselves
in the head
with with that as any kind of a
leadership role in their party
and of course because the cnn and the
the democrats etc
they love this kind of a story because
it makes all republicans look crazy
so she's going to get a lot of attention
if republicans don't get rid of her
you know you do it at your own peril i
mean
she was a big mistake all right uh
so congress continues to be amazingly
incompetent with this relief bill
how many how many years do you have to
wait for an emergency relief bill
i feel like every member of congress
should be fired
for this alone i mean you should just
vote against
every every incumbent
you know because they're not all bad of
course
you know they're there are elected
officials who
you know are doing the right thing or
trying to do the right thing
but as a group they're a complete
failure i mean i
it's just embarrassing to be in a
country where they can't figure out this
emergency relief stuff
it's not that hard it really isn't
this is not this is not abortion it's
not
deciding to go to war this is not that
hard
on the list of things that congress has
to deal with
if they can't do this in a timely
fashion
even if all they decided was to hey
let's give half of it and see how it
goes and
and be ready to give the other half
quickly if if things go well something
like that
that would be reasonable but the way
it's being handled now
just pure stupidity and under these
conditions if the democrats want to go
ahead and just push it through with
you know their their rule
shenanigans which do they have the
option i'd say go ahead
i would rather do something wrong than
do nothing
and i don't think in the case of this
relief stuff i don't think it's ever
going to be wrong to go big
democrats want to go big i think going
big is the right economic decision
in this case how often do i agree with
democrats on
economic decisions maybe never
maybe has never happened but i'm
agreeing with them now
the big number is the right number
that's it that's you know the
the republicans have a good point about
money that hasn't been spent yet let's
spend that first
uh they have a good point uh about maybe
some of the money
is going to people who don't need money
they didn't lose their job in the first
place
that's a good point but where are the
democrats saying
oh you make a good point about let's not
send money to this group
or are they saying we'd love to not send
money to people who didn't lose their
job but we don't know how to identify
them in time
in some fair way so it's just better to
put the money out there and
get things stimulated i'm not even
hearing the argument
are you have you turned on the news and
you've heard
you've heard the democrats say oh this
is why we want this size check
and then talk to a republican who says
oh well but why don't you
only give it to the people who need it
instead of giving it to
people you know don't need it because
you know they don't need it
and what does the democrat say to that
did they say we'd love to do that
and only give it to people who need it
but we don't know how
there's not a mechanism to identify them
in a fair way
i'd like to hear that argument the news
business is so corrupt at this point
that you don't even know the argument
what side am i supposed to be on i don't
know
i mean i default to the big number until
somebody gives me an argument
if there's no argument presented which
is not to say there isn't an argument
but
is not presented to the public i'm going
to use the information i have
and the information i have is that the
bigger number is usually the smart one
in an emergency situation right
so the news business complete
failure on this topic and others as well
um there's some uh
fake news mostly on fox news and their
right-leaning
uh organs remember i told you that
whoever has the the president at the
time
whether republican or democrat the news
organization that
opposes that form of president will be
the one who does most of the fake news
now that may not be true this time but
that's what i predicted so you should
see
more fake news coming out of the
right-leaning
publications compared to what you saw
under trump
here's an example so you've probably
heard this as news but it's fake news
that biden once said that using
executive orders
to govern is like being a dictator
how many of you think that happened
how many of you believe the news
that biden said while campaigning
that trump's use of executive orders
would make him like a dictator and then
the second part of the news is and that
biden is breaking records for executive
orders
how many think how many think that
actually happened
i'm saying looking at your comments yes
i saw the clip
so somebody said i saw the tape i do i
saw the video
you saw with your own eyes right
what do people say when i point out to
them that the fine people
hoax is a hoax how did they respond
how do they respond every single time
they say
uh scott it's not a hoax i saw it on
video
i saw it myself how do people respond
when i say that the
trump suggesting people drink bleach
was a hoax and didn't happen how do
people respond
they respond by saying uh scott i saw it
with my own eyes
i saw the video the video doesn't lie
i sought would you like me to send you
the clip
of the video that clearly says
drinking bleach and of course it doesn't
exist right
but many of you in the comments have
seen the video
of biden saying that using executive
orders to govern
would be like a dictator so many of you
say you've seen that
do you know it doesn't exist right
now now when i tell you that that video
doesn't exist
what's your brain doing right now all of
you who
say you saw it with your own eyes heard
it with your own ears are thinking
what's going on right now because one
thing i could tell you for sure
those of you who saw it with your own
eyes and heard it with your own ears
you really did see it with your own eyes
and you really did hear it with your own
ears
so why would i be telling you it didn't
happen what's going on here is it a
trick
what do you think i'm up to because i
gave you two examples where the other
side
from you politically most of you
politically
had this problem where they thought they
saw things that didn't happen
and i'm telling you that it might have
happened to you what's that feel like
because you saw that it happened to
other people and they're normal people
the people who believe they saw trump
say the neo-nazis are fine people
the people who believe they saw that
with their own eyes and heard it with
their own ears
are not crazy they're normal people
just like you but those normal people
had an experience
a hallucination essentially of something
that didn't happen
i'm telling you you you the people who
said here in the comments
that biden did say you heard it with
your own ears you saw it on the video
probably saw it multiple times that he
said using executive orders
is what dictators do
is anybody having any question in your
mind
now keep in mind that i just gave you
two examples where normal people
imagine something was on video and they
saw it that didn't happen
and i'm saying it's happening to you the
people who think they saw biden say that
right now are you are you even a little
bit
doubting your own impression of what you
saw or heard
let me see in the comments before i
finish my point and tell you what really
happened
and how the illusion is working uh
somebody says
i saw it a stretch to say
um
people got a little quiet now right got
a little quiet
so this is what i was hoping i was
hoping that i had built enough
credibility with this particular
audience over time
that if i tell you something is an
illusion
even if you're positive it's not
is it there just part of you that says
wait a minute this guy's got a pretty
good record of calling out illusions
how would i know if i'm having one you
realize that the whole point of an
illusion
is that the person who's in it is the
one who can't tell
the person who's not in it might be able
to
you know tell you you're having an
illusion an outsider
if they're not having the illusion
themselves but you can't tell
so your level of certainty that biden
said that using executive orders
is for dictators your level of certainty
about that
should not be an indicator of whether it
happened
it shouldn't be it's not an indicator
it's not
it's not a hint it's not it shouldn't
even bias you
here's what really happened on the video
you thought you saw
the context was removed just the way the
fine people hoax happened
just the way the drinking bleach hoax
happened
the context was this that there are some
things you can do executive orders for
there are some things which you can't
and biden was specifically
making the point just like i did that
there are some things that executive
orders are good for
there are some things that you can't use
them for such as
voting on a budget the specific example
they were talking about
and he said that if you were to use an
executive order
where legislation is the is the only way
to go
let's say a budget thing that that would
be like being a dictator
now did trump do that thing
that would be like being a dictator and
the answer is no biden was not accusing
trump
of being a dictator because the
executive orders that trump used
were the same nature of the ones that
biden contemplated even when he was
running
said he would do when he got elected and
then executed
biden was very carefully distinguishing
between things that can be executive
orders just like trump did
and things which you can't do by
executive order because the constitution
doesn't give you that power and if you
were to violate the constitution
by doing an executive order on something
that you shouldn't do an executive order
on
that would be like being a dictator now
i watched the video
from beginning to end and i saw that
just as clear as day
it could not be more clear he said
executive orders in these cases not in
these cases and if you overuse your
executive order you'd be a dictator
so he's not going to do it and he didn't
all right now how many of you still
believe
your original go watch the video again
go watch the video again and you can see
very clearly once i've primed you for it
right
if you're not primed for it and you've
been primed for the opposite
if you would just watch hannity telling
you that
biden says that executive orders are for
dictators
but if hannity had just told you that's
what happened and then he showed you
that clip
what would you see you'd see what
hannity told you you were going to see
because you would be primed to see it
that way
suppose there had never been a hannity
or anybody else
suggesting that um that biden said
something about executive orders and
dictators
and suppose you had just seen the clip
just without any priming
or let's say i had primed you and said
um what you're going to see is that
biden is talking about things you can
and cannot do with executive orders
here's the clip if i had primed you that
way
you wouldn't have seen anything you just
would have seen biden saying sometimes
you can use them sometimes you can't
that's it that was the whole thing
now you got real quiet in the comments
i'm not seeing a lot of pushbacks right
so
be aware that you that if you were let's
say pro-trump
that you are now in a world in which
your own team will be selling you a lot
of fake news
that's going to happen here's an example
that's just fake news
all right
a lot of people online say on twitter
anyway
that the mask mandates are part of some
kind of a secret government plan
to train the public to be compliant
so that when they have future orders for
the public
the public will be so well trained by
this
masked mandate and and the lockdowns and
such
that they'll be ready and primed for
whatever is the next thing they're asked
to do
that's not a thing that
is weird conspiracy theory thinking
because governments are not that
coordinated and not that
competent they don't see that far in the
future
the the least likely thing that's going
on
is that there's a government plot to
train the citizens to be compliant
now you could argue that the effect of
it
is that the public gets used to anything
and that's a good argument
that if you get the public used to doing
anything
it might have an effect on the next
thing that you want them to do that's
true
but to imagine it's some kind of
intentional plan
like a giant government plot to make the
the public more compliant
that's not happening that's that's
bigfoot talk
all right so i would be
i would be embarrassed to say that in
public if i were you
that is that's just crazy talk
there's nobody there's no government
that's that coordinated and evil
and planning on this mental takeover of
the people that's not happening there's
no
there's no room where that's being
discussed
is that's just crazy talk
so yesterday i made some of you mad
about i was talking about
masks and why the risk reward
cost benefit is that you should wear
them even if it turned out later we
found out it didn't work
based on what we know today it would be
the smart decision to
to wear them so i was saying that
yesterday and i was pointing out
that if somebody just says mass don't
work or they say mass do work you just
ignore those people
because nobody knows if they do work and
nobody knows if they don't
you don't know you could have a hunch
you could have a reasonable opinion but
you don't know
so it's a so it's a how do you make
decisions
in the face of the unknown now in my
case i say
uh as somebody pointed out on twitter
yesterday if
viruses travel on moisture and breathing
into your mask
makes it moist on the inside well there
must be some virus that's getting stuck
to your mask
because the moisture is so is that
enough to change the
nature of the infection curve well
that's still unknown
but but something's happening with those
masks because it is stopping
some moisture from getting out now a lot
of people a lot of you disagreed with me
and the the the strongest argument
against
masks um i feel it's fair to
share that with you so here's the
strongest argument you'll see this on
twitter quite a bit and it goes like
this
mess don't work
that's the argument now you might say uh
is there something missing from the
arguments such as
reasons and you know something like that
facts anything to which i say i believe
the argument is that
since masks are not proven to work in
coronavirus
in a randomized controlled study that
that's allowing people to say
mess don't work which is
crazy because the only thing we know is
that it can't be tested because there's
no ethical way to
send a bunch of people into a virus zone
without masks
just to see if they get infected so you
can't do human tests
you can't test people in that way if
you're
well you can't do it under the condition
that you have a strong feeling
that the masks are more good than bad in
that case it's unethical to test it
um if you didn't know anything and you
didn't suspect one way or the other then
maybe it would be ethical
so the only reason i bring this up is
because dr nicole
sapphire who you recognize as a regular
uh medical professional on fox news
um backed me up on that opinion on
twitter
so i just want you to know that there's
one person that fox news
uses as their go-to professional for
medical stuff
who agrees with me that masks are the
right risk-reward decision
all right so i only say that so that
you've heard somebody associated with
uh trump and the right i wouldn't say
trump but let's say
associated with fox news
and is a medical professional and is
following this closely
agrees exactly with me so
that doesn't mean either of our us are
right but you should know that for
context
um when was the last time you knew what
was in
a piece of legislation or an executive
order
sometimes an executive order is kind of
simple you know when trump did them they
were kind of simple
and i guess some of uh bidens are simple
because they're reversing things
but we don't have any conversation about
what the actual policies are do we when
was the last time you turned on the news
and here was a list of the executive
orders that
biden or trump had signed and here's the
analysis of why that's good or bad
based on experts i feel like
the news business isn't even trying to
be news
because we have a government making all
these you know executive orders and
laws we don't even know what they are
it's not even being reported to us
except like the headline
it's a it's a coronavirus bill
don't ask any more questions it's just a
coronavirus bill
maybe we should have some kind of
facility in this country
since the fake news industry isn't
interested to tell us what the
decisions are all about and maybe get a
guess some opinions about whether it's a
good idea or a bad idea
that would be nice
in the news singer marilyn manson
is being accused of a variety of
abusive things i don't know
sexual abuse some kind of thing like
that
and there are a number of women who have
come forward with similar stories
now the most tragic thing about this is
that
these are women who they thought they
were getting into a healthy relationship
with marilyn manson
who by the way that is not marilyn
manson's original name
this is somebody who changed their name
to make it more compatible with a
known mass murderer charles manson
and the women who got involved with
marilyn manson
didn't see any red flags that maybe this
was an unhealthy situation to get into
and i think to myself
he didn't see any red flags at all
there was there was nothing that marilyn
manson had
perhaps sung or performed
nothing about his choice of last name
anything about the situation
it was like a little red flag nothing
looked look pretty safe to everybody
i guess that's the tragedy that these
things can look so safe
and yet be so dangerous
um and when i when i talk about stories
like this i would like to invite
the what about the victims guy
i don't know who would like to play that
role today it's a rotating
role but somebody needs to step in
and get over on twitter and say
something to me along the lines of
scott scott
what about the victims what about the
victims
you monster what about the victims
now i know this is hard to believe
but i actually care about victims i know
hard to believe i actually feel bad
i have empathy for other humans who are
suffering
and tragedy and this will even surprise
you more
if a tragedy happens i don't want it to
happen again
i know surprising right you listen to me
and you're thinking i think that guy
likes tragedies
i think he likes it when bad things
happen to people but no
no i actually don't and if i had it my
way
there would be no extra tragedies
and if i and if i were magic i would
even go back in time
and reverse some of the tragedies that
had already happened
that's the kind of guy i am i know it
seems like
i'm pro-tragedy and that's why
it's such a good public service when the
what about the victims guy
comes onto twitter pretty much every day
and says
you monster what about the victims
what about the victims you freaking
monster
thank goodness for that person because
otherwise you'd be thinking to yourself
hey i think scott he likes tragedies
i feel like he wants more of them
but no no i don't surprise
um here's a story that surprised me a
little but maybe you shouldn't have
you all know the story of ashley babbitt
who was one of the
assaulters on the capitol i'll call it
an assault
and she was the one going through the
broken window
on the top of a door and she was shot
dead by somebody in law enforcement
who basically ended that part of the
assault
by shooting the first person through the
door
there is a decision by investigators
it's not a final decision but it's a
recommendation
by investigators to
decline to bring charges
now if you remember my take on this
i said from what i can see that's a
that's a
that's a clean unfortunate
but clean shooting meaning that
it was an absolutely the right decision
to take the shot
even at the the tragic uh even
with the tragic ending when somebody was
killed who i don't believe should have
been killed
meaning that in in a world that works
properly
she'd still be alive so it's a mistake
in that sense
but in terms of a defense strategy
in terms of preventing more
more bloodshed maybe than there might
have been
i said from the start it looked like a
good good shot
as tragic as it is what
i'm getting a message
what about the victim do it
oh no i should clarify i actually do
feel bad for the
the victim and it's a tragedy
i know surprising i actually feel bad
for people who are hurt
you didn't see that coming i know but
having said that
and certainly with all respect to the
family
and you know friends of uh the woman who
was killed
ashley babbitt wish it hadn't happened
of course
deeply wish it hadn't happened but
the officer who took the shot made the
right decision
in my in my opinion you know not being a
law enforcement
professional i'm open to having that
opinion revised by somebody who knows
more than i do
you know if dan bongino disagrees with
me this afternoon
i'm going to listen to what he has to
say right
but that's my take i think this was the
right decision
i will however uh put this turd in the
punch bowl for you
i don't think there's the slightest
chance that this would be
called a justified shooting had she not
been white
sorry i don't think we live in a world
in which this shooting could have gone
unpunished
except that the person who got shot was
white
you know that's true right you know
that's true
and beca and the reason is obvious
because if it go on the other way if if
it had been a different kind of assault
i think in this particular case
maybe it wouldn't have mattered so much
because the assault on the capital was
you know such a big issue but in general
in general the race of the person
getting shot probably made a big
difference
probably made a big difference
but it was the right decision all right
that is my provocative
live stream for today how many of you
have i made angry
do you let me see in the comments
tell me what you think about it when i
disagree with you
because i know it goes both ways one of
the most common um
positive things that people say about my
live streams
is that they like it when i disagree
with them because it's because those are
the points
that where the friction and the
entertainment happens
um
somebody says the right decision jesus
yeah the right decision to take the shot
because
the alternative would have been worse so
when i say it's the right decision
it's not obviously nobody wants anybody
to get killed
but it was the right decision in terms
of reducing the amount of potential
bloodshed because if they'd gotten
through it could have gotten a lot worse
don't know but the police officer didn't
know either
and was defending the capitol and
defending our government
and under those conditions yeah that was
the right shot
i only disagree with you about education
somebody says i don't know what i say
about education that you would disagree
about
somebody says only when you're
anti-trump i've never been anti-trump
i i've always been the same some things
he did that i liked
some things i didn't it's it's the same
thing i say about aoc
there's no difference why can't you be
why can't you just be four things that
are good and against things that are bad
why do you have to be for trump or
against trump that doesn't even make
sense
the only thing that really bothers me is
when you say the flu doesn't kill people
what i say is that the regular seasonal
flu
probably doesn't kill anywhere near the
number that they report
now obviously if you're weak enough
pretty much anything can kill you
right it doesn't take much if you're
weak enough so i'm not going to say that
nobody's ever died from a seasonal flu
but the numbers that we got from you
know 30 to 80 000 people a year dying
from the regular flu
i would bet every penny i have
that that's exaggerated and a lot and i
based on the fact that
we don't know anybody who dies from the
regular flu
but as soon as we got that same number
of people dying from coronavirus
everybody knew somebody at around at
around
50 80 000 deaths from coronavirus
we all knew somebody who at least knew
somebody who died of it
but still i don't know anybody who died
of regular flu
my whole life never heard of it
so you know that number's made up but it
doesn't mean that nobody died of the flu
now let me to this point one of the
problems that i have
in communication quite often
is that i speak in absolutes
when i believe that people understand
it's not an absolute
and that confuses x percentage of the
population
and i'm always i'm always amazed when it
happens because people don't have the
same
let's say reading or hearing
comprehension
so let me say let me make a general
statement when i say
when i say things like nobody dies
of the regular seasonal flu
how do you hear that do you hear that as
literally not one person dies
because you shouldn't if i say something
that's an absolute
of that nature you should be translating
that in your mind
to oh he means it would be rare or
not many people or or mostly right
that's how your brain should interpret
that but i think that maybe i
more than other people speak in
accidental absolutes because i
assume that you know it's not an
absolute but people will still call me
out and say it's not an absolute
to which i say uh i didn't even think
that was a possibility that you would
take it that way
so i do have that problem communication
wise that i speak in
absolutes more than i should
will i take calls again yeah probably
at some point but uh i would want to use
different
different technology for that
we should take you seriously but not
literally
on the absolutes yes that's how you
should take me
be precise in your speech says uh
peterson yes you should you should be
precise
yeah the absolutes are hyperbole in a
sense that would be
a reasonably thing to say
uh somebody says they die from secondary
causes like
pneumonia yeah i suppose that's the way
it happens
and i should say a few people die of it
and it's
using yeah i think it is lazy i think
that's a fair statement it is lazy
to speak in absolutes and assume that
the
audience understands it that way that
would be fair to say
um
and pneumonia is always the fall guy
somebody says
poor pneumonia it gets blamed for
everything
all right um
if this is a health health issue then
why no one says to get some sun
and get a walk and lose some weight well
i said that
wasn't i the first person who told you
when the pandemic started
that you should walk every day and that
you should get some sun and get your
vitamin d
uh i hear i hear people say it all the
time so if you're saying that
we're not being told that if the
government isn't
you know they're not all over it that's
for sure
but they have said that i mean i think
fauci and berks have probably said
vitamin d is good for you
probably more than once
um
you said people who die from the flu are
listed as dying from something else
yeah for the very old i'm sure that's
true but i don't think there are 50 year
olds who are dying from the flu
or should i say very few of
see how easily it is for me to go and to
get into absolutes
all right that is all i've got to
say for today somebody says 80
000 people died from the seasonal flu in
2018.
well what i'm telling you is they don't
count those
do you know where the 80 000 comes from
it's an
estimate based on how many people died
compared to how many they think usually
die
and then they say well that difference
must be the flu
i'm oversimplifying it a little bit but
it's like that
nobody counts them so nobody counted and
got 80 000.
they just looked at a bunch of
statistics and say well
looks like it could have been 80 000.
all right that's it for now i'll talk to
you tomorrow
bye all right youtubers
have anything uh fascinating to ask me
somebody says 55 of covered deaths have
the flu
i don't know what that means um
who killed ashley babbitt it was one of
the police officers
i don't think that matters um
scott if bigfoot to believe china has a
hundred year plan
no china has a plan for dominating the
world
that they say it you know a number of
chinese officials have said it in public
directly so it's definitely not a
conspiracy to imagine that china wants
to dominate the world
i would say that's as true as anything
could be
um somebody says you assume zero cost of
wearing masks
no i don't there a lot a lot of people
have been saying that but
why would i assume something dumb like
why would i assume that
yeah the the people who say you have not
considered the negative impacts of
wearing masks
to which i say everybody's considered
that
there's nobody in the world who hasn't
considered that every single person who
put on a mask
thinks while they're doing it yeah man
there's a downside to this
you know it's it's probably got a big
downside too everybody considers that
so don't imagine i haven't considered
the obvious it would be one thing to
imagine i hadn't considered something
that's not obvious
that would be a reasonable statement but
when you say somebody hasn't considered
the most obvious part of the whole
question
you're not really a serious player
we all consider all the big stuff it may
be some weird thing i don't consider
that would be worth bringing up
but don't don't say i haven't considered
the most
essential part of the entire
conversation
um all right
let's do we play chess i'm just looking
at your comments now
if you're listening to us on audio it
must be painful
because you can't see the comments um
how is the education system affecting
u.s politics
well in a dangerous way
we're letting our least capable citizens
train our children which are our
teachers
i'll just leave that statement there
there are our least
capable citizens are training our
training our children how to be
good citizens
um exception would be of course my
sister
in case you're listening
so there again is one of my uh
absolute statements it of course is not
true
that every teacher is you know somehow
less good than every other citizen
so you should recognize that as obvious
hyperbole but my point is
what makes teachers uh the moral
standard
they might be very good at teaching you
know the the elements of education
but if they're also teaching you how to
be a good
moral ethical citizen
do they take classes in that what
exactly is their qualification
to teach your children how to be people
as opposed to teaching them how to read
which would be fine so when i say
they're the least capable
i mean that um they don't have any
training that i'm aware of
on what it takes to be a good citizen
all right where's your check all right
that's all for today i'll talk to you
tomorrow
