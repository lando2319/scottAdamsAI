foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
nothing quite like it and are you lucky
to be witnessing it wow good for you
good job you all of you you're looking
sexier and smarter and more successful
than ever
that's just what I expect
and today we're going to take your
experience up to even higher levels and
all you need is a cup of mugger a glass
of tanker Chelsea sign again teen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens
now
yeah that was good
well let's talk about all the things
there's a new political movement forming
in the United States
uh called the pure Bloods
pure Bloods
the people who are anti-vaxxed and
pretty proud of it and they seem to be
unwilling to uh
unwilling to mix with the non-pure
Bloods
so I think the pure blood should form
their own uh political party
see how they do
see how they do I'm all for it
all right we have to talk about Monday
Night Football if you don't know there
was a horrible incident that actually
postponed the entire game so the game
was called off for
I guess postponed I don't think they're
going to play it again but maybe
and it was because a player named dammer
uh Hamlin I hope I'm pronouncing that
right he took a hard hit in the chest
and then he stood up but then he
collapsed with some kind of a serious
heart issue
uh amazingly
he had met he had medical attention in
10 seconds
now that is impressive right now I don't
I don't want to detract from the fact
it's a human human tragedy so first you
know let's let's be human about it and
show some respect to the family and to
the the player who's who's in critical
condition
um so I think we can all agree that the
the human element is the primary story
here or do we all agree that you know
our priorities should be on the health
and safety of the individuals and his
family
so but what having said that there's no
avoiding the fact that it triggered the
entire country
why well because the question of whether
or not
uh a vaccination
had any kind of contributing effect
now
I'm going to run a little experiment
here today
we'll see how this goes
I'm going to talk about the uh very real
possibility
that vaccination may have played a role
in this event
totally possible
so you hear hear me say this as clearly
as possible
this is a red flag
and I think we would all like to know
if if they can tell I don't know what
what happens autopsy wise but we would
all like to know there's a public
interest and it may be a signal that's
worth checking so can we all get on the
same page
that we don't know what happened
but it's enough of a red flag that we
have a genuine interest as a society
which is also an interest in the family
and and the the player right we have a
genuine sincere interest in their
well-being and to know what happened
because it also applies maybe to us
right
so here's the experiment
you just experienced how clearly I said
that
watch how many people say Scott why
aren't you even considering that the
vaccination could have played a role I
am considering it
I am considering yeah he's alive he's in
bad shape
um
Now watch how many people treat me like
I didn't consider it that's the test
because when you when you discuss any
Nuance or say it could be this or it
could be that that's what happens so
we'll we'll see well let's observe
how many people seem to treat me like I
said the opposite of what I just said
okay
now
here's here's what we can take from this
event
we're going to take a lesson
which I'm going to inflict on you on
rational thinking
so let's look at the situation
and let's see what it what is an
irrational way to look at it versus a
rational way an irrational way to look
at it is to say whoa that is obviously
vaccination
well there there's no way that that
could be anything else
we don't know that so that would be bad
thinking if you put a percentage
likelihood on it that could be
reasonable
you got that it could be reasonable
to say well I don't know I've looked at
all the you know all the details I'd say
there's at least a 50 chance or whatever
you put on it now I would say that would
be an opinion
but not irrational
so an opinion can be wrong but still
rational you understand that right
so what do we know what we know is that
the collapse happened almost immediately
after uh what
some people say was an extra hard hit
and other people who would like you to
believe that they're very tough people
they say it was nothing
now do you think that we will be able to
now I watched it live
I was alive and I've watched lots of
football right if you're my age
and you have any interest in sports
whatsoever you have watched a lot of
people get tackled
in my subjective opinion
which in a moment I'm going to tell you
why you shouldn't trust my subjective
opinion so you don't need to say that
because I'm going to say that about
myself my subjective opinion
is that when I watched it it was one of
the hardest hits I've ever seen
I will acknowledge
that many even maybe most of you
possibly looked at it and said exactly
the opposite
why would you see it the opposite of how
I would see it which one of us is having
confirmation bias
the ones who say that was an average hit
they're used to that versus the ones who
say no that was an unusually hard hit
go ahead in the comments tell me who has
confirmation bias
but both yeah this is the case where
there's no ambiguity whatsoever
this is definitely both right so am I
influenced by the fact that I think it's
um probably unlikely
that the hit wasn't the cause
so that so therefore there's an obvious
trigger so you always look for the
trigger for me there's an obvious
trigger that I would be
semi-halucinating in this case would you
agree would you agree there's an obvious
trigger
for me Scott to be hallucinating on how
hard the hit was in other words I could
look at it time and time again and I
would always see it the way I see it
while knowing that you could look at it
time and time again
and see it completely differently right
but
if you say Scott you have a cause for a
confirmation bias that part's right
you're almost certainly right about that
but if you say it doesn't apply to you
that's not rational thinking
this one clearly applies to everybody
right this is the cleanest example of
nobody can have a credible opinion on
this
it's the most subjective thing you'll
ever see
now I'll tell you what I saw
which I will not claim to be true
because the whole context here is we're
also we're all hallucinating basically
you know you're hallucinating I'm
hallucinating you can't help it that
this is one that gives makes us all
hallucinate
here's my hallucination
what I saw was that the uh I guess the
what do you call it the tackling or the
the player that hit the guy who went
down
that looked at me like he hit him with
his shoulder
and so that would reduce the size of the
impact which we know can be important so
in other words if one player had hit
another player full body to full body
that would less likely cause a heart
problem
but if somebody got hit with like a like
a let's say a baseball
really hard
that's known to actually give somebody a
permanent heart attack and die like
there's evidence that that's a thing
so the question would be did this player
get hit in the normal way people get hit
and was there any padding there to
prevent the exact thing that happened
so what I saw was not a normal hit
right now again
I acknowledge I'm hallucinating
but you have to accept that you are too
right so my hallucination I saw the
shoulder hit right about here
um or the other side I guess now here
which I which I wonder if it avoided any
padding there just a question I don't
know if there's any padding there so it
might have hit it like sideways where it
sort of got a little purchase where it
wasn't supposed to and if it hit a hard
like a shoulder
even though the shoulder has pads so
it's you know not as hard as a bare
shoulder could that be enough
I don't know
so what so I asked on Twitter I asked
the Twitter doctors to weigh in
and
um we have the following opinions
the following opinions
one doctor said given that the
um the problem happened immediately
after the hit it was the hit
almost certainly nothing nothing's 100
right everything I say about this except
that we're both having confirmation bias
everything else is like speculative of
you know some percentage chance of being
true
but a an actual medical doctor on
Twitter who by the way and this is
important to the point a medical doctor
who was canceled on Twitter
but came back under Musk he was he was
skeptical of vaccinations
so he was he was banned on Twitter
so somebody skeptical of vaccinations
banned on Twitter for being skeptical of
vaccinations looked at and said it looks
like it's the hit
not probably not the vaccination
now again it's probability right so I'm
not saying he's right or wrong I'm
saying that I'm not a doctor
that is a doctor and the doctor said it
would be weird
to have it at the same time now here's
the Counterpoint all right now here
here's where everybody starts
hallucinating I took aside because it's
not happening you're not seeing me take
a side
here's the other side
Dr Peter McCullough famous
coveted vaccine skeptic
who also has been let's see I think he's
lost his
certifications and stuff so he took a
lot of big hits for being a skeptic on
vaccinations
and
he points out
that the vaccinations might cause a
problem with the heart where if you
combined the
what's the adrenaline if you could
combine the adrenaline of the you know
the sport
with maybe some inflammation
and then you added a hit on top of that
that that would be you know something
you should look into now Dr McCullough
does not say that's definitely the cause
which would be I think that would be
kind of wrong so he takes a perfectly
practical approach which is you should
definitely look into this because
there's a hypothesis that would explain
it
completely
so do you all agree
and I'll use the phrase red flag
do you all agree that in the context of
the entire country being interested in
this question
that it's enough of a red flag
that we would like the medical
professionals to give us an answer
you know the family needs an answer he
needs an answer we hope he's surviving
and we need an answer like that's a
that's a social need at this point
so
here be as clearly as possible
we all I think let me do a fact check
with you
is it the best understood
truth about the so-called vaccinations
that are not really vaccines is that the
so-called truth that
the medical society including Skeptics
like Dr Malone
would say so check me on this they would
say it looks like it probably saved
lives
above a certain age
but that it probably was hurting
especially men below a certain age
so that's the current understanding
right it was probably bad for younger
men
probably saved lives above a certain age
let's say 65.
is that the current
so I'm not taking you aside I'm just
saying that's the current most popular
medical understanding right
now that still leaves open the
possibility
that even the older people
should not have been vaccinated
would you agree
because we might find out you know five
years from now they get some problem we
didn't know about
right so we're still there's still some
question
about the older people whether or not
they actually got the benefit and maybe
we won't know for a few years
but the current medical consensus is it
probably saved lives at least in the
short run
uh probably was bad for younger men
especially
and then more generally
school-aged children
we don't think are necessarily makes any
sense to vaccinate
now that I'm just trying to represent
the common most popular
informed view I'm not saying it's right
because I don't trust anything anymore
all right
so if you were sure that this is another
case of athletes dropping dead because
you saw a compilation video where lots
of athletes were dropping dead
do all of you know that the compilation
videos are fake
the data is probably more reliable
because there's data about excess
mortality and I I don't doubt the data I
don't trust it but I don't doubt it
but the but the video where you can
actually see the people falling over
you know that those have been debunked
right so there are people who were not
vaccinated in some cases
people who survived and it was no big
deal they were just dehydrated
people who there was a identified cause
that was had nothing to do with
vaccinations and then there were a bunch
of them that happened before the
pandemic
but if you put together all those
categories and then you show them all
together is very persuasive so a lot of
people got taken in by that but just
spend a minute you know uh here here's a
general
good General uh process
if you see something that looks sketchy
and people are saying I'm not so sure
that's true
the the least you can do the smallest
amount of intellectual rigor is to
Google the thing you know whatever
you're talking about the headline and
then the word debunked or fact checked
at least see what the other side is
saying right if you don't at least hear
their point of view you can't give any
you know credibility or lack of so at
least hear it
now this is one that if you'd seen the
video of all the people dropping dead
the athletes apparently if you Googled
it you would find that every fact check
says the same thing
well we looked into it and many of these
examples are fake
so there you go
Now problem is we also don't check we
don't trust the fact Checkers but in
this case they showed their work
right they said this player
you know died this date you know stuff
you could check so I got a feeling
they're probably pretty close
to to write on that one
all right here's the question uh this is
a test of your critical thinking all
right
this is a test of your sort of intuitive
understanding of
um statistics and then some of you are
actually trained in statistics
hold off for a second
because I think the people were trained
in statistics are all going to have the
same answer the people who are not
trained are going to have more of a
let's say a common sense answer that
could be misleading all right
so this is a comment from a Twitter user
AO crazio
it's a play on AOC all right and he or
she asks this question how often in the
past have players suffered heart attacks
due to impact to the chest
how often has it happened before
now the essence of the question is if it
had never happened before
and the only time it's ever happened is
in the context of vaccinations
that means something doesn't it
agree or disagree
in the comments
some say no I say no I say yes I say no
no how could you possibly say no
that means you're understanding
statistics basically yeah so
does it tell you that maybe there's
something you should look into
yes or no does it tell you that you
should look into it
solid yes
that the same way you would look at the
vares reports the various reports looks
like hey there's all this scary things
happening that never happened before
it's not a proof
but you're definitely want to look into
it right it's a signal it's a flag
but are there other reasons you could be
seeing what you're seeing
but let me give you a little statistical
lesson
how many things do you think happened on
Monday night at that game
that had never happened before
go just just the Monday Night Football
where the guy
fell over just that day just that game
how many things happened that had never
happened before
a lot
yeah the the actual answer is you know
billions or trillions because literally
all of it never happened before
how many people how many people in the
stands had never been there before
how many times
has that Stadium had a person who
believed they could kill people by their
stare
at the same time somebody fell over
wouldn't that be weird you'd have to
look into that person to see if they
really had psychic powers wouldn't you
wouldn't you let's say you knew that was
true there was somebody there who had
claimed in public for years that they
could kill somebody with their gaze just
like looking at them and then on the
same day the only day they ever went to
a game somebody fell over
is that a red flag
should you look into it to see if this
person has killed others
now what what does your common sense say
so now your common sense is telling you
wait a minute it's rare and there's an
obvious cause for why it might have
happened
but everything that happened that night
was probably the first time it ever
happened
right there are things like it right
things like it but that game had never
happened before
those people have never been there in
that day those those people had never
been there on the age they were that day
every single thing about it was for the
first time
so we live in a world where everything
just continually is super unlikely
super unlikely
what are the odds
that one of the most prominent voices
on the pandemic would be a cartoonist
I I mean literally everything is
unlikely what were the odds that I would
predict that you know Trump would win in
2016 and be right
I don't know everything's unlikely so
the the thing that you have to Grapple
with is that while something could
definitely be a signal that you should
look into it and this is
it doesn't really tell you that much
about How likely it was
that they're a little bit disconnected
the the common sense says you need to
look into it but the statistical part of
you says
I don't know could be anything could be
anything but what but we would agree
that whatever it is is the first time it
happened
so let me let me reverse the question
what are the odds
that if the vaccination is killing young
people when they get hit
by you know a football hit what are the
odds we wouldn't have seen it before
because they're all vaccinated
they're all young
and they're all getting hit hard
we wouldn't have seen even one case
until now
right because because every situation is
hugely unlikely
so it would be accurate to say How
likely is it that we suspect the
vaccines
so-called vaccines of exactly this
problem and then we've never seen
exactly this problem and then we have
exactly this problem
all right your common sense says that's
got to be connected
but when was the last time we saw
anybody die or almost die uh I mean his
heart stopped that's pretty close to
being dead
um have we ever seen anybody vaccinated
who was taken out by a hit
never so whatever this turns out to be
it'll be the first time
right
if it's a vaccine injury it will be the
first time
after all these football games and all
these practice hits and game hits it'll
be the first time
and if it's something completely
unrelated to the vaccination
it will also be the first time
do you think you could estimate the odds
of either those first times
which was which was more likely given
that neither of them have ever happened
how do you estimate the odds of
something that's never happened before
because every path
is it never happened
and
right
there all never happens so if you
thought one of them has never happened
but the other is sort of more ordinary
now people try to game that game that by
telling me but Scott it does happen all
the time
because there's these you know these uh
videos of all the athletes falling over
which we just talked about were already
debunked
so if your confirmation bias says I'm
pretty sure Dr Malone and Dr McCullough
got this right and these vaccinations
are dangerous especially for young men
it's got to be this
could be
could be
Dr
Drew Tweed mnf first time what's mnf
and and let me acknowledge let me
acknowledge that the hit looked normal
to people who believe the vaccination
killed them
and to people who don't necessarily
think the vaccination was the cause
could have been
to us I think many of us it looked like
an extremely hard hit
now
uh
did I say that my point of view
should have a higher priority or more
credibility than your point of view
where you say it looked like an average
hit or at least normalish whose point of
view should you value greater
neither right there it's sort of a tie
because we both have triggers for cut
for cognitive distance or confirmation
bias both
and under those conditions you should
trust neither of us
that would be the best take now here's
who I would trust
if the football players themselves
having had some time to look at the
video If football players say that was a
hard hit I would be influenced by that
would you
would you do you think you would change
your mind if the actual players said
yeah that that was unusual
I'm not saying they will because they
might you know want to project some
toughness and and also maybe it wasn't
maybe it wasn't unusual
I'm gonna say unusually hard
whatever that means to you all right
enough about that
um did I mention that Dr Peter
McCullough has blocked me on Twitter
he blocked me on Twitter now I think
that was a good block
like I I actually support that block
that that has
and it's not because I think that the
things I've said are inappropriate
it's just that I've been a Critic of his
and if he doesn't want to listen to it
I totally support him blocking me right
so some blocks just make sense like you
just don't need to see it and he didn't
need to see me
right I'm sure I was saying things other
people might have been saying you know
there's nothing special about my
commentary
so if he blocked me I support it it did
block me and I I do support his block
but I did go you know I went through a
Anonymous page and checked out what he's
had to say I didn't realize
that he was terminated as
editor-in-chief of his cardio renal
medicine reviews some kind of magazine
because they didn't like his coveted
commentary he was stripped of his board
certifications this is directly from him
by the way strips of his board
certifications and internal medicine and
Cardiology
and he points out that this was after
Decades of perfect clinical performance
board scores and hundreds of
peer-reviewed Publications so let's give
him his do he's a seriously accomplished
person
um but he says none of this will stop
until there's a needle in every arm
so let me say this about that
um I asked this question on locals
before I turned on YouTube but maybe
somebody on YouTube knows now don't
confuse them with Dr Malone
because I think some of us do that you
know the prominent doctors who are
skeptical of vaccinations but Dr Malone
is vaccinated
you wouldn't do it now but is that the
same for McAuliffe
does anybody know for sure if Dr
McCullough has got the original
vaccinations
or did he
did he say no to it from the start
I I think your answers are probably
conflating Dr Malone with him
if you have if you have a source for
that could you send it to me
man oh mandated oh mandated because he
was practicing medicine
but I don't know was he seeing patients
he he was actively practicing was he I
don't know if he was actively practicing
so so it's interesting that we don't
know the answer to that isn't it
don't you find it fascinating you don't
know the answer to that
because
now I know of two vaccine skeptical
doctors who both got vaccinated
and that should tell you that in the in
the fog of War period
people were making decisions that would
be different
than after the virus mutated and after
we knew more about it and all that
all right
um
what else is happening
all right I have a solution for fixing
everything in healthcare
I think you're gonna like this
this is actually like a seriously good
suggestion totally practical
totally doable
this might I I'm going to predict that
you will like this idea better than
anything I've ever suggested
I'm like building it up so like I have a
high bar to cross you will like this
suggestion
better than anything I've ever suggested
in any domain you ready for this
your doctor should be able to
refer you to
researchers whose only job is to tell
you if the medicine or prescribed
treatment
makes sense based on the science or not
because your doctor's not going to do
that you would like your doctor to do
that but as a practical matter they
can't really keep up with every study
that's you know you can't really expect
that it's like yeah keep up with that
every study and they're also not experts
at looking at studies
and they might not be experts on knowing
who funded the study
they might not know the track record of
whoever you know performed the study
they might not know if a paper had been
recalled they might not know if a paper
if the paper said there's one paper that
says one thing but maybe two papers that
said the other
so here's what we need in the United
States we need a separate profession
from the medical doctors that work
closely with the doctors but
independently so you want a situation
where your doctor can say I recommend
this medicine
and I also recommend that you get a
second opinion from a non-doctor who's
you know this person who's good at
looking at studies
then let's say the person who looks at
the study says yes
you know I see no reason to overrule the
doctor now you've got a little more
Comfort right but suppose the researcher
says you know what your doctor is
unaware that there's new research so I
would say be careful about that now you
don't want the researcher to give you
medical advice right
but if they give you Contra contrary
advice you can take that back to your
doctor and your doctor can look at the
same link and say oh wow I'm I'm
influenced by that the last I knew this
was a good idea but it's a good thing we
have this new system where you can get
an independent non-medical view of just
the research
and and now that that person has told me
well I'm not the expert in research so
I'm going to trust the person I
recommended to do it
and then they change there all right you
tell me
best idea I've ever had
go
best idea I've ever had
no doubt about it
you're saying no
what do you mean are you saying that I
had some other better idea
or or you don't think this was a good
idea I guess I'm asking the question
wrong
I shouldn't be asking you if it's my
best idea
I should be asking you if it's a good
idea so let's let's change the question
right
is it a good idea
okay that's a different answer well I
guess I'm happy that you disagreed with
me because I would suggest that you
think I had even better ideas if I had a
better idea than this one
that would be a pretty good idea but I
don't know I mean I can't think of one
yeah all right so we won't say best but
there's nothing wrong with this idea
right
would you agree there's literally
nothing wrong with the idea and it's
practical it's something you totally do
you you could start this business as a
startup tomorrow couldn't you
this could be a startup
tomorrow
and if I knew that it existed would I
use it
that's a I'm sorry absolutely
all right let me ask you this question
if that business existed
and the only thing you have to do to
access it was say go to a website
and say Here's here's my doctor's
recommendation here's my symptoms
do the research and then they give you
an answer and you can take it to your
doctor or not take it to your doctor
that's just up to you and let's say they
charged
hundred dollars and insurance didn't
cover at least initially
I could see that they would cover it but
not initially
would you pay a hundred dollars
to make sure that the drug your doctor
told you to take forever
because a lot of the drugs are forever
drugs would you pay a hundred dollars
to find out if a forever drug was really
a good idea
I sure would
you know relative to you know the
effects of your entire life a hundred
dollars is pretty cheap now I don't know
if you could get it for a hundred
dollars because it might require a human
to do more than 100 of research but
here's the cool part
once the humans have done the more than
a hundred dollars are worth of research
on a drug
then they have it for the next time
so the next person who asks you know hey
how about my blood pressure meds that's
already packaged they're like oh we
looked into it here's your answer we'll
check just to see if anything new
happened since we looked into it but if
nothing new happened
that's five minutes
and then you're a hundred dollars in
five minutes so your your initial
experience for this hypothetical company
might be it takes a while and they lose
money but once they've packaged up all
the main drugs and they can give you an
opinion on them then it's a hundred
dollars for five minutes work
all right
biggest problem in the world just solved
I I asked people on Twitter uh if they
had a choice would they believe the
recommendation of the doctor about a
specific treatment or somebody was
really good at spotting and
there were more people who said they'd
trust the person who's good at spotting
BS
and I would too I would too so I agree
with them
all right uh I'm gonna I'm gonna call
this next segment internet dads to the
rescue
uh I've been telling you for a while now
that there's a thing forming this like
um
it's almost like a adjunct to the
republic or the Constitution sort of not
not part of the Constitution and it's
the internet dads basically credible
voices they don't have to be all male
but you could say internet parents if
you want
um
and that they would reach a level of
influence
that people would check with them just
to check their own thinking
and here's the perfect example so 60
Minutes runs this interview with this uh
Paul Ehrlich
who wrote a book called the population
bomb back in late 60s or 70s or
something
and that influenced
probably a lot of environmental
decisions and probably had some you know
maybe good and maybe worse impacts
now
if people were to believe Paul erlich
they would think my God we're in trouble
the whole world is you can't support us
we're going to have to kill people
intentionally to have a to have a chance
of survival I mean just horrible things
but as soon as that 60 Minutes interview
came out
which has you know now blessed by a
famed news organization 60 minutes and
also CBS
but that takes a lot of if you see
something on 60 Minutes that's going to
take a lot of Firepower
for anybody to say you should ignore it
right but look at the Firepower that
that was immediately
um applied to this right almost
immediately you had Jordan Peterson
calling on it and saying that
this guy is like the worst thing that
ever happened
now how valuable is that when Jordan
Peterson pulls no punches basically just
says this guy's don't listen to
anything he says he's been wrong about
everything forever
how useful is that for society
super
because Peterson is smart enough and
credible enough
that his opinion influences yours
right that is so useful
who else weighed in
um Elon Musk
Elon Musk said directly his population
bomb book might be the most damaging
anti-human thing ever written
when Elon Musk calls on
somebody
people listen right I'm not saying
everybody believes everybody but you
listen to that
and then who else uh Michael
schellenberger long thread calling
 on him there you go perfect now
shellenberger brings not just the
criticism but he brings a detailed
analysis of all the things he said and
how wrong they were how useful is that
I mean talk about a treasure you know
talk about a service to the country
that's useful
um
how about Alex Epstein
also did a long thread called out all of
the problems that Eric has had
perfectly documented check your sources
how useful is that
like super useful right
um
and that's that's just four
right now I consider myself
somewhat accidentally in the internet
dab category on some topics anyway and I
simply boost
the four people that I mentioned I
boosted all their signal
so my 820
000 followers you know get a little
extra boost
so I feel like uh Eric's in his uh
influence
was greatly reduced at least for people
who use social media in a certain way
by the fact that these internet dads
immediately just uh trained all of their
Firepower on this guy I mean it was
immediate
it was brutal
and it was right
but what does the news do how did the
professional news well first of all CBS
the aired the thing apparently without
much criticism
how about the other news organizations
oh internet big brothers and sisters you
would say
uh yeah
yeah it was just another malthusian
prediction that's true
all right so I like I like how uh that
developed
all right I'm going to give you a little
lesson on strategy
and defamation
I'm going to use idiot cartoonist uh Ben
Garrison as my Whipping Boy to make my
example right so
this situation has more to do with me
than you
but I'm going to try to make it useful
to you
by teaching you something about
defamation that you didn't know okay
so to prove defamation that what we're
talking about is his comic strip that
was widely
um it was pretty viral and uh suggests
that Dr fauci hypnotized me
into getting uh multiple vaccinations
I've got three needles in my arm and I
seem to be insisting that you believe
that you take the vaccinations because
science says some now since that's the
opposite of my view
my view was always clearly and loudly
and publicly do not take any
you know don't take any medical advice
from me number one but also that I
didn't trust
any data about the vaccinations
so it's literally the opposite of my
frequent public statements that you
should not trust any of the signs
so the way he represented me is the
person who trusts all of the science
literally the opposite now I ran a poll
and asked how many people would either
stop following me it did stop following
me or would no longer buy let's say a
Dilbert calendar or book or something
it was like 46 of the people answered
said that they had a negative view of me
because of my it turns out their false
beliefs about what I believed and it
devastated my income streams
probably took a third of it off
because you count the live stream
audience shrunk by about that amount and
then I haven't checked that but I'm sure
if I check my calendar sales you'll see
that they they sold that you know
roughly a similar rate every year but my
guess is that this year it fell off a
cliff
it's you know easy to check I'll check
it later today
so it's very clear that that that the
rumor about my opinion that was
incorrect that he boosted
uh affected my business now
you might know that it's almost
impossible to prove defamation
because here's what you have to prove
this is a pretty high standard and it
should be
so the five elements of defamation there
might be some State differences but five
elements uh publication of the
information so the first thing that has
to be published
correct all right so it was published
second thing the person being defamed me
was identified by the statement
yes I'm identified by name and picture
in the in the comic
number three the remarks had a negative
impact on the person's reputation
easy to demonstrate I could just run a
poll and say do you think less of me
because you believed I believe this I
would get massive number of people said
yes I used to follow you but now I think
less of you because and then they would
say something that never happened
because Ben Garrison and others told him
it did
so that one's easy
the published information is
demonstratively false that's easy
because everything I said is in public
so I can find you the video I can find
you the tweets now he would also produce
tweets
that apparently support his View
but they're all easy to debunk because
they're out of context if you put them
back in context they're all consistent
you know all the way through
so that's easy I can I can show this
false and that the defendant is at fault
so in this case that would be idiot Ben
Garrison so yeah he made the cartoon so
he'd be at fault now
you also have to demonstrate malice
meaning that you're doing it with bad
intentions while knowing it wasn't true
that's a hard one
how can you possibly demonstrate malice
well I'm doing it right now
so on Instagram I think we're blocked on
Twitter on Instagram I just left him a
message
I don't know if you'll see it probably
so I'm sorry somebody will mention it to
him in which I've asked him to uh
to do a public statement or tweet in
which he acknowledges that the comic
does not capture my actual opinion
now I expect he won't do that
but in not doing it malice will be
established
because there won't be any reason not to
do it unless he just wants me to hurt
right if he wanted to be a good person
he would acknowledge that he had maybe
misinterpreted me it's easy to
demonstrate
and then he would say oh shoot I guess I
did put some misinformation out there so
I'll put in a statement just a simple
statement that says don't take the comic
too seriously
it was just in fun and I don't mean to
say that represented his opinion
would you think that was fair
would that be fair to you
just say it was just a joke
I'm not going to take it away it's on
the internet you can't really remove it
um but it does I'm not I'm not claiming
it represents his View
and then maybe show a link to my
explanation of you know that shows my
actual views
now if that happened I'd say oh okay
there's a guy who made a
an understandable mistake and he's
correcting it and that which at which
point I would say oh okay no no lawsuit
needed
mistake is a mistake
mistake is a mistake people make them I
I'm sure I've not sure a positive I'm
positive I've accused people of things
uh incorrectly
and when they pointed out well actually
the the Covington kids situation this is
the exact case
so I defamed them because I saw a bad
video that was misleading so I defamed
them
totally said bad things about this guy's
character there was a hundred percent
untrue
but it was a mistake
so the moment I realized it was a
mistake or I apologized publicly
and clarified My Views
and that that becomes impossible to sue
all right so I made myself unsuitable
because I declared a mistake
other people have made the same mistake
it was an obvious mistake and then I
made it better I I corrected the record
as publicly and clearly as I can
so
if it turns out that Ben Garrison is
just an idiot and that's the end of the
story
then I'm sure you wouldn't mind
correcting it and restoring his
reputation in my mind at the same time
now
a number of well-meaning people have
said to me Scott you know you're going
to waste
you know maybe two hundred thousand
dollars on this including paying his his
lawyer fees if you lose
of course I know that
of course I know that
do you think I would do it anyway
if I had a 95 chance of losing
and not only losing but having to pay a
hundred thousand dollars to his lawyer
because I lost would I do it
oh yeah yeah why would I do it why would
I do it do you know why
uh not at a principle exactly
now not to teach him a lesson
okay somebody got the right answer
the the only thing I want out of this is
correcting the record
because in my specific case since what I
do is talk to you about the news and
make predictions and stuff if if an
incorrect view of me is out there then I
can't do this
at least not as effectively because
every time I talk in public somebody's
gonna be quoting Ben Garrison and saying
well if you've got all this stuff wrong
we shouldn't believe all this other
stuff
and if that were true it would be a good
point
but it's permanently damaging to me and
my ability to provide value to the
public
because you know I don't do this for the
money right it has a it's definitely
monetized but this isn't what I would
choose to do
for money if I wanted money I would just
agree with my audience all the time
like most people do it's an easy formula
but I'm not in it to monetize it in that
way right
I don't mind monetizing it because it's
you know helps with the incentives and
stuff
so
um here's the real play the play is this
I want to create way more attention
to the lawsuit
than the original uh the new original
comic got
and if losing if losing the court case
also surfaces the fact that it was uh
not accurate statement about me that'd
be fine
because every time I lost the case
somebody say Hey you even lost that case
and I'd say here's here's the decision
read it for yourself and it would show
that the that I had demonstrated it was
factually inaccurate because that'll be
easy
uh but maybe I don't demonstrate his
intentions
that's good enough
as long as the court could look at it
and then tell the rest of you oh yeah
it's definitely wrong the cartoon does
mischaracterize his opinion
I don't care what happens after that
right if that costs me a quarter of a
million dollars
money well spent
but all he has to do to not waste a year
of his life is to Simply read my profile
document
see what my actual opinion is and then
put in a statement
that he's stands corrected
that's all I ask
all right
um
and specifically the claim that I was
hypnotized by fauci could be debunked by
the fact that I was the first public
figure to call him a liar
now
I don't know if that's true but but I
think the claim probably is
I think I'm the first person to call him
a liar about the pandemic now other
people might have called him a liar
about prior work but I didn't know who
he was before then but in terms of the
pandemic I'm the first public figure to
say that guy's on TV lying to you right
now
you're not going to like what I call
that as his lie
I said
he is saying that you don't need a mask
is not his real opinion
that it's a lie now I don't want to get
into the conversation of do masks work
that's not what we're talking about
we're only talking about his belief and
did he say the opposite of his belief
and the answer is yes because he
admitted it
so
nobody nobody in the game
trusted fauci less than I did
you can't top that I am the number one
fouchy doubter in the whole United
States
not you Ben Garrison
Ben Garrison I'll bet when he said you
don't need these masks you said oh he's
telling the truth well that would be
pretty gullible
what are you going to believe everything
the fauci says I do
I don't
so it's a weird situation where the
people who are most gullible
think that I was
sort of projection sort of thing
all right what else is going on
let's talk about the 2024 election
Rasmussen has some new poll
says most voters don't want President
Biden to seek re-election
so here are the numbers just 33 percent
of likely U.S voters so this would be of
all parties thing Biden should run for
re-election and 55 percent say no
um
but it's not much better for Trump not
much better for Trump so Trump 35
percent of Voters think Trump
um should run
and the majority of 53 think he
shouldn't so those are
almost identical
to Biden
so one possibility is we're going to
have two candidates that nobody wants
that's that's very likely
it's very likely we'll have two
candidates that nobody wants
nobody meaning the majority
now I'm going to make a an optimistic
prediction
I don't know what the odds of this
coming true are so you know just just
know I'm being optimistic
I think the two contenders in the end
will be DeSantis and Newsome
DeSantis and Newsome here's why
I don't think uh
I don't think Biden I don't think
Democrats will allow Biden to run
because I think Trump would take him
this time what do you think
do you think Trump would take him I
think he would
especially if if we are watching the
polls more carefully I suppose
all right
uh
oh to Santa's now I don't think anybody
important will run as an independent
so here's the basis I think Democrats as
a group will overrule Biden
how many would agree with that that
Biden wants to run I think that's real
but I think Democrats won't take the
chance it's just too big of a chance so
I think Democrats will overrule Biden
and then if they do
they need somebody to replace them and I
think I think newsom's their strongest
player
right now yes I know all the negatives
that are hurled at him I know them all
right you don't have to remind me but
remember they they have a weak bench
you know he's the strongest in a pretty
weak field
now on the Trump side
um
you know there are a lot of smart people
I think Ben Shapiro is one and yeah I
say this often but Ben Shapiro is in my
small small group of people
where if his opinion differs from mine I
immediately question my opinions
does anybody else do that
is that is that a Ben Shapiro thing like
there are other people like that Lyft
Jordan Peterson disagrees with me I'm
gonna I'm gonna stop and think right
so yeah because you know he's he's
thought about it you know he knows the
whole context you know he knows the
history yeah dershowitz is another one
um so if he disagrees with me I'm just
going to stop and say okay
let's let's look at my point of view I
might have missed something here and he
thinks that it's
somewhat clear that DeSantis will be the
candidate
I don't see it as clearly as he does
because I don't see the path to it
because it seems like it would require
uh Trump to stand down I don't see that
happening but
um I don't think Republicans
will take the risk
of trump losing a second time
because we're very much affected by the
last war you know you're always fighting
the last war and it's going to feel like
Trump
lost the last election when he was young
enough to be you know viable
uh
I think Trump's age will show
and if if uh if DeSantis decides he
could be a candidate
people will just defective
all right
um
how many how many people would agree
with my prediction that in the end the
candidates will be DeSantis and Newsome
go
how many
I see some yeses
lots of yeses actually I like somebody
answered with a percentage I like that I
like anybody who answers that with a
percentage
yeah
do you feel also that the country is so
unhappy with the last several years
that it feels impossible that we would
let somebody back in office who is
responsible for anything at the federal
level for the last five years
it feels like
I know by Biden Trump are looking a lot
like the same person to me
I hate to say it I mean they're very
different but in some ways they look
like the same person today
because they both they both seem like
their their window has passed they both
look like the past
they both smell uh this is the worst
thing to say and just to say it this way
they both smell like a pandemic
that's the best way to say it they both
smell like a pandemic
now
you could give us the argument of who
did what right or wrong Trump with his
vaccinations you know Biden with
whatever he did
but they both smell like a H we just
need somebody that doesn't smell like a
pandemic
I suppose DeSantis and Newsome do too
but it's different
yeah I don't DeSantis doesn't smell like
a pandemic he's he feels like some he
smells like somebody who tried to
who manage the situation well it just
feels different
cabbage urine
that's funny
all right let me give you this challenge
what uh what Republican could beat
DeSantis besides if you think Trump
is there there's nobody would be
DeSantis
besides maybe Trump
and I don't who do you think could be
Newsom on the Democrat side
I I don't know if Rand Paul inspires
people
uh in that presidential way
he's definitely you know one of the most
valuable players in Congress
so as a as a as a member of Congress
he's a superstar in my opinion
the presidential is just sort of a
different vibe now I don't think Kerry
lake has proven herself in elected
office and I think it does matter I mean
Trump was bigger than that
but uh but he at least ran a big company
uh
all right Joe Rogan for president
is Rand Paul too short to be president
you know
I don't know
and and Tom Cotton uh voted for the
Omnibus Bill I think
so that made some conservatives unhappy
you think Hakeem Jeffries could win in a
Democrat primary
Maybe
but I don't think he'd run
what
uh
yeah I don't think Kamala can win
Elon Musk was not born in America he
can't
all right that is all I have for today
is there any topic I missed anything
else happening
can hypnosis help a man prolong ability
to have sex without reaching climax
you want me to hypnotize you to have
fewer
or does it take longer to climax you
know the I don't know the answer to the
question
so I haven't heard of anybody working on
that specific problem
but um probably
probably maybe not for every person
all right
um
you don't need hypnosis for that I agree
all right that's all I got for now I'm
gonna go do something else I'll talk to
the locals people for a little bit
