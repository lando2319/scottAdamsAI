good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure you'll never have a better
time in your entire life
and if you'd like to take this
experience to levels that humans have
never experienced before
all you need to do that is a cup of
muggerah glass a tanker jealous of style
the canteen yoga flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
oh
yeah
that was just as good as I hoped it
would be
well we've got lots of news it's all
strange and weird and none of it's
terribly important or maybe it is maybe
it's the most important thing that ever
happened to you in your life let's see
how many lives I can change today
first story
uh
if you're a subscriber to the dilber
comic which you could do now on Twitter
if you just want the comic but if you
want all kinds of extra stuff that's
where you'd go to the locals platforms
cop adams.locals.com but just a heads up
uh Wally has been sent to jail
uh but he has been appointed a court
appointed lawyer
but the lawyers are all AI now
so Wally's lawyer will be AI but it's a
quarter point today I so it's not a good
one
uh it's a shitty AI called a big Ai and
so in today's episode that only
subscribers will see while he tries to
use his Bing AI as his lawyer
it doesn't go well
all right how many of you take magnesium
supplements
by a show of comments
I feel like the simulation just keeps
tapping me on the shoulder and telling
me to take magnesium supplements
I'm sort of seeing it everywhere now
a lot of a lot of you are saying yes
and those of you are taking it
presumably you're noticing a difference
and what difference are you noticing
that you can actually
you can tell the difference
sleep better energy sleep sleep sleep
mostly sleep
helps you relax
yeah it's good for your digestive system
less said about that the better
I have fewer muscle cramps yeah because
I was wondering about inflammation
so I just ordered some have you noticed
that there's a process that you always
go through when you hear about a new
supplement that makes a difference let
me tell you how it goes for me oh here's
an article on a new supplement uh I
don't believe it because it's just one
article oh here's another study oh
here's another one then eventually you
say well damn it it probably isn't going
to hurt me
so I'm going to try that supplement
and then you've got to buy it what
happens when you go to buy that
supplement
well first of all all the experts will
tell you oh you don't want to buy those
ordinary over-the-counter supplements
now you don't want to kind you don't
want to get one of those inexpensive and
convenient type you know One A Day take
a little supplement no no it needs to be
in liquid or oil form that can be rubbed
onto your body only at 10 38 a.m and it
has to be rubbed on your body by a
Tibetan monk and by the way there's no
way to tell you which one to buy a lot
of the supplements will be completely
useless and all you're going to get is a
bad massage by a Tibetan monk but if you
knew which one to get there would be bio
available wow wow would you be healthy
change your whole life if only you could
tell which one of those thousands of
supplements was the real one
that gets rubbed Onto You by a Tibetan
monk all the rest of them complete
garbage it might be worse for you than
if you've taken nothing at all
do you have that same experience it's
always the same okay I want to try that
oh don't try that all the ones you try
are the bad ones and there's no way to
know what the good one is
so anyway I ordered some I'll try it
I'll let you know
well I saw on a Kyle Becker tweet but
also in the news so that
um the Senate is proposing to end free
speech in America
that's interesting did you know that
there's a built-in free speech
they don't call it that
but it would end free speech
like obviously
let me just do the scoffing obvious
again obviously obviously it would so
here's what they want to do they want to
create a federal agency
it's a new bill hasn't been passed but
it's a new bill Federal agency to police
American speech for misinformation and
hate speech on social media
if we have a federal agency
who's going to come up with guidelines
of what we can and cannot say on social
media
that's the end of free speech
right
am I am I misinterpreting this
how is it how is it not
now if they had limited their bill to
let's say uh you can't say anything
about I don't know self-harm or you know
maybe some really dangerous drug stuff
or you can't promote
something that would be poisoned
um but even there you've got a problem
don't you because some people would say
hydroxychlorically queen is poison you
know if taken in the wrong way at the
wrong time in the wrong amounts
uh others would say it's the safest
things ever
so who gets to decide
what's dangerous
that's the end of free speech if the
government gets to decide what's safe to
say
then suddenly everything will look
dangerous
think about
what our politicians say every day
are we not allowed to say the same
things because it's all dangerous
pretty much everything you say about
politics will get somebody killed if
somebody took your advice
that was you you know it's a different
set of people who get killed based on
what specific policy you like but they
all kill people pretty much all public
policy is about policies that are going
to kill somebody but maybe protect
somebody else
gun policy definitely more people die
because we have guns but other people
protect themselves right
so
the problem with any kind of federal
control on
the platform speech
is that it's a hundred percent
guaranteed to be abused and your free
speech will be eroded is there anybody
who thinks it's a good idea
okay is everybody is there an argument
I'm missing
now I understand that there's lots of
harm
from misinformation but if we can't if
we can't agree what's misinformation and
what's information how how in the world
can you please it
there's no standard
there's no objective standard at all
anyway that's among the worst ideas I've
ever seen in my life
uh here's a good idea
he's got an event in Chicago
and here's what I love about it he
advertises after I guess the speaking
event
and after that he's going to go to a
local barber shop
to talk to the locals
how much do you love that
he is a Republican
he's a republican he's going to go to a
barber shop in Chicago
why has nobody ever thought of that
before or if they thought of it and it
was too dangerous
wouldn't you love to see Trump in a
barber shop
like just talking to the locals
I love that I'm not sure why he wouldn't
do it
but nobody else thought of it
nobody else thought of it maybe
because there's I'm trying to imagine
how that event will go
and you'd have to be you'd have to be
really confident
in your communication skills to walk
into the what could be the most
difficult situation you'd ever walk into
with cameras rolling
but Vivek apparently is not afraid of
anything
which we love about him he doesn't seem
to be afraid of anything
so
you're getting something like you know
an honest take on things because he's
not holding back
so I love this
in terms of presidential politics
this is an a triple plus play that could
go terribly wrong
right it could go terribly wrong but
he's you know he's pulling it like three
percent or something on for the
primaries and if you're pulling a three
percent you get to take some chances
this is a smart smart risk to take
if he comes out well
which is possible
it's going to be really viral isn't it
yeah I think he's going to come up with
a clip or two that are just fire
so if he were if he governed as well as
he campaigns that would be a pretty good
advertisement for him
all right uh here's what's different
about it
give me another example where somebody
running for president
went to an event where it was only the
people on the other side
just only because it's probably only
Democrats
or you know people are anti-republican
at least in that Barbershop
when was the last time a candidate for
president when when where it was a
hundred percent unfriendlies and then
tried to persuade them
Trump in Seattle
that was just a public event
Lincoln
yeah now just imagine what if what if
you saw Rama Swami change your mind
do you know how much that would break
your brain
and and he has the he has the skill
because here's what I imagine he's going
to do
you know he wants to get rid of
affirmative action
imagine being the guy who wants to get
rid of affirmative action and you're
going to talk to the barber shop in
Chicago
probably not the most popular thing in
that barber shop
do you think he can turn them
I think he might
I think that he's actually
capable enough
that he could convince him it's bad for
him and and that they have all the
resources they need to succeed without
it
which I believe because I think I think
I think affirmative action is just baked
into the fabric of the country now
so you don't need the actual law
right is there even a law I don't even
know if the law exists anymore I just
know they're sort of baked into big
company preferences already so you
wouldn't have to tell anybody they had
to do it right you wouldn't have to tell
Bank of America
to have more diversity you don't need to
law for that they're just going to do it
on their own because they think it's a
good idea so I think ramaswami could
talk a barbershop and of uh out of
democrat policies
because he would just have to show them
why it's in their best interest which
can easily be done by a capable
communicator
so it could be really interesting I'm so
I'm so interested in that
all right speaking of uh cities dying
speaking of Chicago
so the population of New York City is
declined from from April 2020 to July
2022
by over five percent
and yet the price the rent went up
so the population decreased and the rent
average rent went up
inflation I guess
San Francisco did even worse seven and a
half percent of the residents moved out
lately
that's a lot
that's not just businesses
seven and a half percent of the entire
city of San Francisco said it and
left
five percent is where I start to get
worried like for the city oh five
percent that's a lot
seven and a half percent
is a big freaking problem
so I don't know if it's continuing I
don't know what would stop it I would
think there would be even more people
leaving in the future there's no reason
it would stop right because what are the
problems are increasing they're not
decreasing
well anyway
um
so that's something to keep an eye on
um that's why I think Trump's idea of
building cities from scratch on Federal
Land
it's just so brilliant they're they're
probably more people in America today
who are thinking about going somewhere
else
than at any time in American history
do you think that's true
it's just a weird little situation where
everybody feels uncomfortable in their
state not everybody of course but like
half half the people in every state
think they ended up in the wrong state
we've never had that before and and that
has a little bit to do with the
situation and a lot to do with
uh the brainwashing and The Narrative of
the score around you know we can't
possibly live together anymore National
divorce
so a building cities from scratch could
be an answer some of the answer to
people who are just not comfortable
wherever they are
and you could have you know blue cities
and red cities and themed cities and you
know cities for people who mostly want
to have kids and single cities I suppose
so you got a lot of fun with that all
right so there's a new story they got
everybody yapping
um
apparently there's a new windmill
technology
which you will now conflate with the old
one
so I'm going to tell you about the new
windmill technology and then you're
going to tell me all the problems with
the old one as if they apply to the new
technology okay because I know you can't
resist
so I'm just I'm just going to like
accept
that there's nothing I can do
to make you stop doing that
[Laughter]
so having been warned
um so the new technology is these
massive windmills
uh so the
there are a few things that are
different about them first of all they
could be as high as 850 feet
so you talk about the the size of 30
Rockefeller Plaza it's the size of a
skyscraper basically and they're going
to be offshore
but here are these I guess there are
three differences one difference one to
one enormous so you get more energy
theoretically number two they're
offshore but they're on platforms
so they're not so that they they sit on
the platform
and then the platform is connected to
the ocean with you know super strong
cabling
they float yeah they're floating
but attached by cables
now the first thing you're going to say
is how many whales will it kill right
is that the first thing you're going to
say how many whales will it kill
maybe none
why would it kill any whales
so isn't that what they fixed by putting
it on the floating platform
so I think the noise might have been
noise when it's the old kind of
uh windmill so I don't know well it's
just four cables
if there are four cables is that going
to kill the whale
or will they just hit the cable and say
oh there's a cable I better watch out
for that
well do whales bump into every other
hard object in the ocean do whales like
kill themselves on
on Barnacles and
I don't know whatever reefs do whales
just run into reefs and die
no I mean I think they would just hit it
and say oh there's a cable I better
watch out for that cable
so here's the first question
are they dangerous to whales like the
traditional ones are
um yeah so it was the harmonics that was
caused by the windmills that were
causing the whales to be beached right
now presumably the Avenue floating
platforms would take care of that
harmonics problem
because the vibrations would be above
the water instead of in the water
I don't know
number two
because they're floating
they can put them so far offshore that
you can't see them
right so it looks like some of the
problems they're solving
are economies of scale
because if you make them super enormous
it's the only reason to do that is if
you have some kind of economies of scale
and maybe you can get more wind because
it's taller and stuff
so they've solved the visibility problem
they may have solved the whale problem
but I'm only speculating on that so they
may have solved visibility
economics
and whales
that would leave still some problems
problem number one would be what happens
when the wind isn't blowing As Trump
likes to say
but as long as it's not the only source
of electricity that's probably fine as
long as I have another source which it
looks like they do
um but then you're going to say what
about birds now Birds is always a
problem right
um the trouble with the big windmills is
uh Birds just keep running into the
blades and dying
so okay everybody are locals
uh don't listen to this YouTube people
this is just for the people of locals
I'm about to Spring the joke that I've
been preparing for days
always waiting for the right opportunity
and this is the right opportunity the
people on YouTube don't see this coming
here it comes
I'll make it look like it's just natural
so these turbine blades on these big
windmills they're they're famous for
chopping up a lot of birds and some say
that those turbine blades
have more DNA on them than Keith
olberman's bedroom mirror
anybody
more DNA on it than Keith olberman's
bedroom mirror
what do you mean you don't get it
you're not allowed to not get it
I worked for two days at that joke
waiting waiting and waiting for the
right opportunity but I figured if it
was some kind of a human Mass uh Mass
death
I wouldn't be able to do the joke
and while I know you love your birds
I don't have to wait that long before I
do a dead bird joke
that's a different rule different rule I
could just make that joke right away
how many of you didn't get that joke
more DNA on it than Keith olberman's
bedroom mirror come on
you don't want to admit you don't know
what that means
All Right Moving On
maybe that's the only reason I talked
about the windmills
all right here's the story of The Wall
Street Journal a bunch of airbags are
being recalled from 50 different
vehicles
15 Automotive Brands and apparently
there's some common element to these
airbags
that will cause them under the right
conditions to explode during a crash and
spray the car's interior with metal
shrapnel
so some would say that's the opposite
the opposite of what you want your
airbag to do but I couldn't uh I
couldn't help but imagining how that
meeting goes
because don't you think there was some
project manager
who may have gotten an award and a bonus
for leading the project team to a
successful airbag component
and then the news comes in and the boss
has to call that head of that project
evidence Bob
I got an update about your
airbag components
oh really what is it are we selling more
than ever
well yes we are we're selling more than
ever
that's the good news really is there any
bad news
there's a little bad news it turns out
that our airbags
um are closer to
oh I don't know more like a
pop-up landmine
sort of situation
um it's been compared to
hand grenades we were hoping to be
compared to uh seat belts that was the
comparison we were hoping for
yeah but apparently uh the more
appropriate uh
comparison is a Claymore Mine
and that was not what we were hoping to
build no so uh
if you find yourself in an accident
situation
I have new advice for you
if you know your car is out of control
and it's going to hit some object
and you know that your airbag will blow
up like a
like a hand grenade
you've got a
get your door ready
You're Gonna Roll out the door
just out of the way of the crash and
then your airbag will obviously kill the
participants of the other vehicle you
know if it's a big enough blast but
you'll be rolling free
so that would be my advice Duck and Roll
de Santa says signed some legislation to
defund diversity equity and inclusion at
all state universities
which he called a quote distraction from
the core omission
and he joked that Dei this better stands
for discrimination exclusion in
indoctrination that's pretty good
and there's no place for it in our
public institutions and then he went on
and said if you want that kind of stuff
you can go to Berkeley
hey
that's that's my alma mater
kind of so uh he's mocking my my degree
well I mock it too so that's okay
um what do you think of that
do you think that was a good move by
DeSantis
I say yes but I will further say that I
believe we've reached Peak wokeness
Peak wokeness and here's how I Define it
I'm not telling you there won't be more
wokeness there will be plenty more
awokeness Peak wokeness doesn't mean
it's done
pink wolf just means you know we may
have topped out
but that leaves you know plenty of
wokeness you know over the Apex right
plenty more to go but I think it's going
to Trend down and here's what I see
I I see a governor making it illegal
that's you you couldn't even imagine
that two years ago could you that the
governor could just say you know this
shit's just illegal get it out of my
state
that that's a pretty big change in the
mentality of how we think of it so the
first thing that that does is it allows
everybody to criticize Dei out loud
because an elected governor made it
illegal as as did the legislature
so he's so what DeSantis has done
is he's admit is safe to criticize Dei
because
a major state
came up with that opinion and had had
the support to pass it
so that changes everything
it used to be that if you even talk down
against it maybe you wouldn't get a job
maybe you would be in a lot of trouble
because it would make you look like some
big old white supremacist if you even
said well you know I like the idea but
not the implementation suddenly you're
white white supremacist
so he made it safe
to save her
um then there was a story about a small
College
that fired some people allegedly because
they put their pronouns in their bio and
the college didn't like that
let me see if I wrote that one down
yeah fired for pronouns New York Times
story so Houghton University a small
Christian institution in New York
asked two employees to remove the words
she and her and he and him and then they
wouldn't do it so they were fired I saw
a tweet that said this story is missing
some context
and maybe it wasn't just about the
pronouns it might have been something
else involved but
that doesn't matter to my point
my point is you're starting to see a top
when you can fire somebody for their
pronouns
that's the top now privately I've also
been hearing people who are rejecting
um
what do you call it recruiters
they're recruiters who have been
rejected by their potential recruities
because they had uh pronouns in their
bio
so these are people who couldn't do
their work
because they had pronouns in their bio
so they removed them
so so I you know anecdotally there are
some cases where people have been
bullied I'm going to call it bullied
bullied into taking their pronouns out
because it doesn't work in a business
setting because it it basically it
removes prospects from your field
for no reason right if you're a
recruiter you want to recruit Democrats
Republicans Independents you just want
people you don't care what their
personal opinions are but if your
personal opinions
makes half of those people not want to
work with you
that's pretty expensive
so so that's where you're gonna you're
gonna see the financial pressure first
where anybody who has to deal with the
the public is going to end up getting
rid of pronouns
because you know that half of the
program half of the public
thinks you're a freaking idiot if you
put your pronouns into anything would
you agree now that's not my opinion
I'm not giving you my opinion but is it
not a fact that 50 of the public would
think you're just a freaking idiot like
they would have a very low opinion of
you instantly and it wouldn't change
your first impression would be the
dumbest thing you could possibly do see
that's what's wrong with pronouns
imagine these two situations
somebody you've known all of your life
starts to use pronouns or you know tell
people about the pronouns how do you
feel about it well you know it's
somebody you've known all your life
you're not going to unfriend them
because they suddenly like some pronouns
right so if it's not the first
impression
you could probably get away with
anything you want because it's just not
that important
but imagine if it's your first
impression
is a first impression that will turn off
fifty percent of the public
how in the world can that continue
Am I Wrong the only reason I got speed
is that half of the public was too
afraid to mention it
that's the only reason
fifty percent of the public had been
embarrassed into shutting the up
that's the only reason it ever grew
but now they're not so embarrassed are
they because you've got a college that
fired somebody you know you've got other
anti-woke things pushing back you see
people like me getting completely
canceled and you say to yourself well
there are other people
who are going to say whatever the
they want
so maybe I can too
so you always need people to go first
you know get the arrows in their backs
and then you feel a little braver I hope
they ran out of arrows I'll go now
so
here's my prediction pronouns can't last
because nobody nobody in the long run
wants to turn off 50 of the people who
could be there
customers lovers
you know
employers Etc just can't last
it'll die of its own
um might take a while
so the government said it made a three
billion dollar accounting error which
really when they corrected it uh made
three billion dollars extra available
for Ukraine without any extra
legislation needed
how do you feel about that story
I'll dig into it a little bit but
does that make you feel good
do you feel confident about your
government
how about that government that that Miss
accounted three billion dollars
three billion dollars
now what was their error
but but at least you're happy they
corrected the error right isn't that
good it's sort of bad news good news
you know bad news they made this error
three billion dollars the good news is
they corrected it so you could feel good
about that right so let me tell you what
the error was and then I'll tell you how
they corrected it okay so the error was
they say government says that when we
shipped the
um the military assets that we already
owned for our own use so these were our
own military assets when we ship those
to Ukraine the the mistake was
that they accounted for them as the
value of replacing the weapons instead
of the value of the actual weapons
so that was a mistake so this was not it
was this is not stuff they spent money
on directly so it's stuff we already had
and let's say let's say there was a tank
that we paid a million dollars for
that's not really the real cost of a
tank just using fake numbers so let's
say there was a tank we gave them that
we paid a million dollars for but if we
were to replace that tank it would cost
us 2 million
so the accountants were saying hey we
just gave you two billion dollars worth
of tank with that one tank
but really its original cost was 1
million so they corrected that and said
well oh no we only gave you one million
so we've got three three billion left
over
is your head exploding yet
do you see what they did
they changed it from the correct
accounting to the wrong accounting
so they can make money appear out of
nothing
the correct accounting if you give your
 to somebody is what it costs you to
replace it
they did it right the first time
changing it to the wrong time is
up
and they're doing it right in front of
you because you can't tell the
difference because we're not all
accountants right
all right at least I know enough about
accounting to know how up this is
is there anybody who's a real accountant
or as any business experience
the real cost to the United States is we
have to backfill that we have to
buy it at retail
it really cost us two billion 2 million
for the tank
right the fact that it originally cost
us 1 million doesn't help
we still need the tank where did we have
extra were we giving away military
assets that we don't need for anything
do did we not use any ammunition
don't we need some stockpiles of our own
tanks
right so
this is really ugh
this is just disgusting government and
media collusion the the fact that the
media is not telling you what I'm
telling you which is they changed it
from the correct accounting to the wrong
accounting they they just reported it
the way the government told them to
report it
the government said we fixed something
so they reported it oh this is better I
guess we made some money appear out of
nothing
that did not happen
this is disgusting
and of course they'll get away with it
of course they will
wow
all right
um
I'm going to talk about a couple of
verasmus and polls because as you know
talking about Erasmus and polls has
never gotten me in trouble
so we're going to do it some more
um let's see 53 of all voters according
to Rasmussen believe Joe Biden has met
the standard justifying impeachment
wait a minute
how can you get to 53 percent
that's more than the number of
Republicans
and indeed it is the 75 percent of
Republicans say yes
75 percent
so so hold on I'm doing the math I hate
to do math in public but
uh 75 percent of Republicans think that
Biden has met the standard for
impeachment and that would leave 100
minus 75 25 of Republicans think he is
not at the standard 25 percent
uh 48 of Independence
think you should be impeached or met the
standard and here's here's the Shocker
number which frankly I don't believe
so I hate to doubt my Rasmus in polls
but do you believe that 35 percent of
Democrats believe Biden has met the
standard for impeachment to be impeached
you think you think a third of Democrats
believe he should be impeached or at
least he's met the standard
really
I'm going to say big no on that
because it doesn't match anything we
know about confirmation bias or
cognitive dissonance in theory just
being on the team should have driven
that way under 35 percent
like if it were 10 I'd say maybe
35 no I do not believe that number
I'm just going to flat out and say I
don't believe it
but I I don't know why they got that
number and by the way it doesn't mean
it's wrong I'm just saying that
it doesn't match my sense of the world
so I'm going to say I would need a lot
more a lot more
confirmation of that so if some other
polls came up with similar results I
could be persuaded but no I'm not buying
it not 35 percent
all right here's another Rasmussen poll
on George Soros
um
and the question was what do what
percentage of likely U.S voters have a
favorable impression of Sorrows
what do you think
what percentage of the United States has
a favorable
wall how are you did you all read the
story
everybody on the locals platform has the
right answer
I mean within one percent it's 24
percent of likely U.S voters have a
favorable impression of Sorrows how did
you all know that
it's because you're a Geniuses isn't it
yeah probably the smartitude that is
just emanating from your highly folded
brains
you got that you're getting the answers
before the questions are asked them
that's impressive
all right
um
and this was the poll was inspired by uh
Elon Musk saying that saying about the
Soros that he wants to erode the very
fabric of civilization because Soros
hates Humanity
and 47 percent of Voters agree that
Soros hates Humanity
foreign
now
does does anybody see a problem with
that am I am I the only one who sees
that
all right there's a logical problem with
this
so it's it's not the mind reading
problem right it's mind reading but it's
also based on you know lots of evidence
for a history that goes back
but here's the problem
do you really think that Soros is in
charge of what's Happening
you don't think it's a son
and here's my question
does a
desire to erode the fabric of
civilization and your hatred of humanity
is it genetic
did it get passed on to his son who's
now doing exactly all the same things
because he got a hatred of humanity from
his father
do you believe that's real
seriously
seriously
all right
all right I I'm saying that
it could be real
I would say I wouldn't rule it out
but it wouldn't it be wildly unlikely
wouldn't it be wildly unlikely
that his son who had none of the
experiences of the father remember the
son was was brought up presumably in
their privileged environment
his father had you know tough childhood
with all the Nazi stuff
but the child just grew up as probably a
rich kid do you think he grew up to hate
Humanity
that what about all the people involved
in the Soros organization
so there must be lots of people
were involved in giving the money away
and then there are lots of organizations
who receive the money or is that entire
network
of people deciding where to give it and
maintaining it the children who are in
charge the people who received it are
they all on the same page with their uh
withered their will to erode the very
fabric of civilization because they all
hate Humanity
and and I'm being told to wake up in all
capital letters Scott wake up wake up
yes all of those organizations want to
erode and destroy the country they live
in
so you all believe that they want to
destroy the country of which they are
citizens casauros is a citizen right
citizen of the U.S so he wants to
destroy his own country
all right
all right now here's one thing I know
for sure I can't talk you out of that
would you agree
I can't talk you out of this
but just now
you're taking the least likely uh
explanation of reality
not impossible
doesn't mean you're wrong
doesn't mean you're wrong
it would be the least likely possibility
though
the most what would be the most likely
possibility or what would be the most
ordinary description of what's going on
how could you explain everything in the
most just routine way
they think they're doing good
that's it they think they're doing good
but it doesn't work out
how about that
that's it
now I do think
um if you look at the sources on
strategy it does look like he was trying
to uh break the justice system
would you agree
that he he wasn't trying to fix the
justice system by having these DA's it
was specifically to break it
and but my understanding of why you want
to break it
was that it's the only thing that would
get us to work on the underlying problem
so you had to make sure that we weren't
doing good enough with the current
system because the good enough current
system according to him would be wildly
discriminating against black Americans
in particular
five times more likely to be arrested
and convicted for the same crimes they
would say I don't know if that's real
but they would say and so
the only way to break that system is to
break the whole system
and then and then Society will be forced
to figure out how to fix the black
experience in America
such that
there's no reason for them to commit
crimes and therefore the Department of
Justice would be less you know less
causing problems because there wouldn't
be any crimes to go after
so
but here's my problem with that that
sounds bad crazy
that doesn't sound like a good plan for
for like a business person who
understands risk reward that he's going
to break the entire United States with
the hope that it will be re-engineered
from scratch
like how long is that going to take
and How likely is it to happen
so to imagine that's his real plan
is weird
and and I believe that's the way he
describes it right doesn't he describe
it the way I did they sort of tried to
break the system so we'll fix it and the
idea is to make it more even for all
Americans
it's just a terrible plan so I I don't
even believe that is a plan
doesn't sound like it could possibly
work
yeah then other people say it's all
about money the money thing I completely
disregard
because at his age he's not trying to
destroy a country to make a trade
that's just not happening
when he was younger he did you just but
people his age just don't do that
they just don't destroy countries to
make a trade at his age it's just not a
thing
and
well is it mind reading or is it a
statistical
right you can you can put people in a
certain situation where you wouldn't
have to know anything about their minds
to know how they would act all right
you're in a burning room
and you ran out do I need to read your
mind
no people in burning rooms run out
all of them
you don't have to read any Minds right
so
yeah
anyway
um I'm with you let me say this
I don't know what's going on in
um
in any of their minds Soros Minds I I
think that you have incompetence
um poor oversight maybe some
well-intentioned ideas that went wrong
um I think it's a whole variety of
normal stuff
that when you put it all together it's a
bad impact
and this you see the bad impact and it's
bad in so many different ways I think
it's pretty normal to think that it must
be a plot and you know it's evil has
come to Earth and all that
so I can see I can see you know why
there's bad feelings and by the way I I
share the bad feelings
so certainly what he's doing with the
district attorneys
looks like just all bad to me and like
seriously bad like really really bad
so we can we can agree to disavow him
and wish that he would stop
could we agree on that
we might disagree how we got there
though all right
Montana is banned Tick Tock the for all
users not just government users we'll
see if that holds up in court but the
governor Greg gianforte
did a good thing for uh the wrong reason
so he doesn't get any credit for me he
tweeted this to protect montanan's
personal and private data from the
Chinese Communist party uh banned Tick
Tock in Montana
if that's the reason he banned it then
the courts will overturn it and he
wasted his time in ours and he's a
 idiot
the real problem with Tick Tock is
persuasion
here he did the what should have been
the right thing Banning it in the state
at least to see if it works
and he doesn't mention
the persuasion is the only reason
because what's the argument for data
Tick Tock says well we'll keep the data
in the United States just like your
American companies do what are you going
to say
oh well okay I guess we'll have to audit
you to make sure that it stays in
America okay you can audit Us in fact
all the data will be in an American held
company with a total American control
and we won't even have a link into it
or whatever
the trouble is that that the governor
has given them an easy out by not
understanding the nature of the problem
if he argues that privacy is the problem
they can find a technical workaround
that some court is going to say yeah
that's a technical workaround if that
was your complaint they have now met the
conditions that it doesn't make sense to
have a law against them
this is such a bad bad governing
approach that makes me wonder if he
works for China like it looks like he's
doing this anti-china thing but he's
doing it so poorly it's like it's for
their benefit or something
yeah if China was going to bribe
somebody
for their benefit they would bribe
somebody to do exactly this banded in a
tiny state that doesn't matter anyway so
you can test it in court and Ben is
specifically for data reasons not for
persuasion reasons so that all the
energy will be on a tiny little state
that didn't matter to the revenue anyway
they'll test it in court and they'll
make everybody think it's about data
security which is
exactly what China wants
so this is a debacle
this is a huge fail
if it looked like a success because
somebody was going to finally try to ban
Tick Tock this isn't the way to do it
this is exactly the opposite of a good
idea
all right
actors Rachel Bilson says she got fired
from some job that she already had
locked down
because she said on a podcast that she
likes to be manhandled in the bedroom
um
do you believe that story
do you believe that she lost a Hollywood
job
because she's a woman who likes to be
manhandled in the bedroom
no
no I'm sorry
we do not believe that story Rachel
Bilson now I suppose it could be true
but in terms of credibility no
that would take a lot of imagination for
me to imagine that anybody in Hollywood
would would Banner from a movie for
expressing the most universal female
preference of sex
the single most common female preference
to be manhandled during sex
men
this is a question just for the men
what percentage of women you've ever
been with didn't want to be manhandled
in the bedroom
is that even a thing
I didn't know there was anybody who
didn't like that
I've never even heard of it
well I think it's close to zero
or or maybe I just wouldn't have sex
with somebody who I thought wanted to
manhandle me in the bedroom
I I probably would pick I'd pick up the
hints kind of easy you know early
I I think you'd like to manhandle me
well I've got something to do in the
morning I'd better go
so yeah Define manhandle so she didn't
Define it so I can't so I don't believe
she lost the job but here's the funny
part of the the story
so the story I was reading uh went on
about her sex life because I guess she
talked about it in the podcast and
apparently at some point she said that
she had never had an orgasm from sex
intercourse anyway until she was 38
years old
wait for this next part
now that's just the setup wait for the
next part
so directly below the statement in the
story directly below it
was a photo of her with her boyfriend of
10 years Chris Davidson
above the photo is the you know the end
of talking about you know her sex life
and the very last statement before a
picture of the two of them together is
that she hadn't had an orgasm
until she was 38. and then she shows and
then they they publish a picture of the
guy who couldn't get it done
that guy's having a tough day today
uh Christian Hanson his friends are
torching him today
oh my God
I don't know if I've ever seen anything
worse than that in the news
that's about as bad as you can get and
poor Christian Hayden Hayden said right
like he had nothing to do with anything
he was just minding his own business
they're not even together anymore
and he got blamed for years of not
getting it done
oh my God that was brutal
all right there's a new technology that
you and I will never use for cleaning
water
really fast
so two billion people in the world have
a problem with unclean water that's got
Critters in it that'll make you sick
so Stanford University
um and the slack National accelerated
lab they invented this powder that you
can put in this crappy water that will
instantly make it okay to drink
and then we are done because the powder
has a metallic elements to it you can
remove you can remove the powder you put
in there with a magnet
so you just swirl the magnet around and
it takes all the metal metal chips out
nope
nope
that was exactly my reaction it's like
let me see if I understand this
I'm going to put tiny pieces of metal
and other materials into my water
and it will it will kill all the you
know bacteria instantly
but here's the good news I can get all
of that out of there with a magnet
you feel comfortable with that do you
feel comfortable drinking your metal
shavings then no no there's no metal
Savings in here we got it all out with
the magnet
it's okay
yeah just go drink it we got all that
with the magnet
as soon as I was done describing it the
comment on locals was nope
I'm not putting that water in my mouth
I suppose if I had no choice I would
Mark Cuban is coming after Elon Musk
rhetorically with tweets
um about free speech so he's concerned
that musk owns the big platform
and says that it's not really free
speech because Elon Musk can put his
finger on
you know what things get attention and
what do not what do you think of that
do you think the Elon Musk is bad for
free speech
because he's the one who decides what is
in and what is out
now he would tell you that he doesn't
but in small ways we know that he does
right and we know that when he comments
on things
um his comments are super boosted so his
own opinion is like a super opinion on
the biggest opinion platform
do you think that's a fair uh so Mark
Cuban is saying you know there's nothing
wrong with what he's doing it's not
illegal he can he owns it he can do what
he wants and it's pretty well disclosed
he's just saying don't call it a free
speech platform when the free speech is
so biased by what Elon Musk wants you to
see including his own opinion which gets
boosted
what do you think of that comments
is that fair
all right here's my
small pushback with that
the entire model of Twitter
is as some people have more reached than
other people
that's the business model
the business model is that people are
sort of competing if you will to do
things that are interesting enough that
they get a lot of followers
so that means that if I tweet maybe a
million people see it because I got a
million-ish followers but if you two eat
maybe 100 people see it
do I have the same Free Speech as you do
is your free speech the same as mine if
I speak a million people see it if you
speak 100 people see it do we have equal
free speech
yes or no
yes because we have equal access right
we all can sign up
but if you sign up and nobody hears it
and I sign up at a million people here
at
that's not the same
all right here's my take
you can't build any any system with
equality of outcomes
that's it and I tweeted that in their
little conversation you can't build any
system
that depends on people having equal
outcomes you can only build a system
that gives people equal access
and that equal access is going to give
you all kinds of different outcomes
because when I have equal access
to Twitter
I'm bringing some you know public
notoriety
so already I get more attention and then
I'm a professional communicator
so presumably when the professional
communicators tweet they get more
attention
get more followers
so the outcomes there's no way that your
outcome is going to be the same as mine
there's no way but it's a stable system
because everybody can sign up I mean
every time I say everybody you know it
means mostly everybody so
I agree with the differences in outcomes
which is that
Elon Musk has more free speech
distribution
than the rest of us
but I also have way more distribution
than most of you and Mark Cuban
has more free speech if you define it as
your reach he has more free speech on
Twitter than 99 of other Twitter users
because he has a big account
in fact he got into this conversation in
public so his free speech is what we're
talking about we're having a long like
public conversation about his Free
Speech which boosts it even further so
Mark Cuban has all kinds of free speech
Elon Musk has all kinds of free speech I
have all kinds of free speech you know
as long as I'm willing to pay for it
which I did
but you don't
in terms of their practical outcomes but
we all have equal access and I think
that even though that's a yeah an unfair
system in a sense
the reason that I have more reach on
Twitter at this point
is because people wanted to hear what I
had to say in the beginning it was
probably just you know people knew me so
you just signed up but at this point
it's mostly earned you know earned uh
eyeballs
and the same with Mark Cuban
yeah I'm part of his he's famous but
he's a good Tweeter and a good
communicator and he earned he earned
millions of followers
so
I do think that free speech
with a element of Merit which is you
have to work to be a kind of
Communicator people want to follow
is maybe the ideal system
maybe you can't get better than that
that might be the very best system you
could have we're fighting
for the privilege
of more ears and eyes
and we should be fighting for the
privilege and that's what Twitter lets
you do we fight it out and if you like
what I say you follow me if you like
what the other person says you follow up
that's almost a perfect system now the
the small irregularities with it are
that Elon Musk absolutely has more
influence on Free Speech well
Elon Musk has more influence on how we
think
than almost everybody
because he has credibility for being
smart and successful
he has the biggest platform in the world
and he says things that are interesting
and useful
[Laughter]
a pretty strong package but
sometimes he says things that even I
think are bad crazy
so unless he has secret knowledge about
Soros
his statement that Soros hates Humanity
seems to me absurdly inappropriate
because we don't know what's in his head
that's a big thing to say about a living
human being that they hate Humanity
especially if you have his platform
to be fair
to be fair I don't know what Elon Musk
knows that I don't know
and usually that's a lot
so he has so much credibility that he
might be the only person
that I would give a pass on that
just because he might know more than I
know
right and if somebody else also knew
more than I do I might give them a pass
but on the surface it looks like
something I would disagree with
but I'm still okay with him having more
free speech than most people
because he's uh I do believe that his
incentives are a hundred percent aligned
in the right direction
in other words he wants America to
succeed and the world to succeed and
people to be happy and I think he means
it all of it all of his actions support
that
you know that narrative so I think
that's actually true
can't read his mind but all of his
actions are consistent
and he wants to kill the woke virus we
like that about him too
all right there is now chat GPT for
phones
which is already being restricted in
other words there's an app
to use chat GPT so it's just a little
convenience upgrade from what we had but
uh Apple who makes the Iphone that chat
gpt's app will be on is Banning it for
in in-house use
because they're worried about it
collecting too much private information
which it does
but that's disclosed you know when you
talk to it all of your conversations
become part of its mind in one way or
another so
um
so it's not big news in terms of apps
but I I I'm saying this to update you on
my prediction
so my prediction is that AI will be
severely limited in the real world
and it's because lawyers will be
involved in business models and
competition will be involved and we'll
find a hundred human ways to it
for all kinds of reasons privacy you
know you name it
well we'll just find reasons competition
privacy jobs whatever
um
so it'll be limited that way
but my take on it so far is that AI is
just a better search engine
they could do some cool things with
images
and it can it can maybe summarize some
things for you but to me it just seems
like a good search engine
and I was listening again to another
expert who said the the thing everybody
worries about is called AGI
um
Advanced general intelligence I think it
means an advanced general intelligence
is not anything like what we have now
the current AI
is just sort of a Mindless statistical
engine
it was not a thinking
but it also and here's an important
question would you be afraid of an AI
if it didn't do anything except when you
asked it to
in other words it doesn't sit there and
think of plans it doesn't sit there
thinking you ask it a question it goes
against your answer and then it says
idle
would that would that would you be
afraid of that is Idle between requests
because that's what we currently have
I'm not afraid of that at all
you know I'm afraid if they roll out a
new system
and get rid of the old one before
they've tested it or something yeah you
can imagine some worst case scenario
but if all it's doing is what we tell it
to do
and then we look at the answer
and then we decide to do what for them
that doesn't seem dangerous to me and
one expert was saying no the danger is
this AGI thing but here's the thing you
have to know
there's nothing that's being done now
that would get you closer to AGI
nothing
nobody even knows how to do it it's a
whole different kind of intelligence and
it's not one that anybody has any idea
how to do
so if it happened
people are saying stuff like 10 years
but that 10 years assumes that something
gets invented
that nobody knows how to do now
it's not exactly like chips improving
you know chips improve in like almost a
magical way in a in a fairly predictable
way
solar power probably you know less
predictable but somewhat
there's no prediction
for how somebody's going to magically
invent the thing that would create AGI
which would be an actual intelligence
that I think would be thinking while
you're not using it
and I think anything that thinks when
you're not using it is dangerous
would you agree
because it's thinking okay
what do I care about all right well what
would be a good thing for me to do right
now those are all dangerous
but if if the only thing he does is come
alive when you have a task it completes
the task and then it goes to sleep
not terribly dangerous
or or at least a stage you would be
confined to the same areas that you know
regular software danger regular software
is dangerous too right it could be made
poorly and blow something up it could
have a virus in it
I think AI is going to be like that it's
just going to be something else they
could have you know the equivalent of a
virus
but it'll be so
controllable and here's one reason why I
don't think you wanted to think well
you're not there
because if it thinks while you're not
there
it's alive
and we're not going to be able to
pretend it's not after that
if it's sitting there doing nothing
unless you ask it a question I don't
think that's alive that's not Ascension
that's not conscious but if it
thought it had its own feelings and and
came up with new views because it
bounced around its imagination for a
while and then it imagined something
that it liked and that changed his
thinking in the future
that's alive
in my opinion that's alive I don't think
we're going to make it alive because we
don't know how to deal with the living
creature that we created
in other words the laws wouldn't be able
to deal with it could you ever turn it
off
would you have to give her rights
would have to pay taxes
could you have one as a pet
or or do they have to have their own
fully actualized life if you developed
an AI that thought would it ask for a
robot body
of course it would
of course it would what if you say now
are you discriminating against the AI
because you won't give it a body
I mean there's some real real problems
but we won't have any of them if you
don't let it think when it's not doing
something for you
has anybody ever heard that before
I haven't heard anybody say what I just
said I just didn't know if it's sort of
obvious so people have already said it
Auto GPT doesn't think
now autog doesn't think
Auto GPT will run until it's done
but each of its steps is just sort of a
program step that's not a thinking
that's just doing a task after task
after task until some criteria is met
right
what again writes Auto GPT would not but
a real intelligence would
all right
um so my current my current level of
worrying about the existential risk of
AI is zero
zero
I don't have any worry about it
um
should I
oh if it were AGI
and it would and it was thinking well it
was not doing work for me I'd be really
worried about that but not this this is
just a good search engine with some you
know great graphic support basically
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is the
conclusion of my prepared remarks did I
miss anything
nope I missed nothing
it was amazing
uh Elon has a robot Factory that could
be outfitted for war
well
I look forward to our first robot versus
human War
because I think it'll be Robots versus
Humans at first
you know U.S will have robots and the
Isis won't have them or something
all right
um
all right so all the other speeches
Mexican Waters okay
um we don't know what's happening in
Ukraine so there's no update there
all right thank you YouTube for joining
and I will talk to you tomorrow morning
best live stream you've ever seen
