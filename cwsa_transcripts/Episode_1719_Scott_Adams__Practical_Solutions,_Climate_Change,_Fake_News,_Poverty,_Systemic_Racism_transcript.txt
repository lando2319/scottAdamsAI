good morning everybody
and welcome
to not only the highlight of
civilization
and the best day of your life but today
i'm going to solve some of
civilization's
most thorny problems does that sound
like hyperbole
well
interestingly
it's not
now i'm not saying that i'm making up
all these solutions myself
in one case i'm just going to tell you
about a solution maybe you didn't know
about
but
in a few other cases i'm actually going
to solve
the biggest problems in the world
you don't think i can do it
well
doubters stay around
but wouldn't you like to take it up a
notch for this special holiday
uh it's april 20th
and on april 20th do we do the
simultaneous sip
well optionally you could but for this
day only
in celebration of the specialness of it
we will be doing these simultaneous
whatever
today only
so when we get to that part
whatever
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass
or whatever a tanker chelsea stein i
can't eat injector flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
or whatever
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous
whatever
and it happens now go
oh wow
so good
now are you ready are you ready for me
to solve or tell you
the solution
i take no credit for this whatsoever
this is just something that's in the
news
climate change we're going to knock that
one out first you ready solution to
climate change the company rolls royce
does more than make cars they have a
nuclear division
and their nuclear division says that by
2024
they expect that at least in the uk
they'll have a regulatory approval
for
factory-built
mini nuclear power plants
and what this means is they will solve
the economics
of
safe nuclear power
by 2024
now of course it would take a while for
the united states to do something like
it but what they will have done is prove
proven the model
once they prove the model
that other companies presumably will
follow the model and the model is this
the problem with building a nuclear
power plant is that they're all one-off
every design is you know uses stuff that
exists but the the total design is sort
of new every time
because there's always an element added
and you know that sort of thing
but
suppose every nuclear power plant were
exactly the same
and they were small enough so that the
components of them could be built in the
factory and every one would be the same
so once you've
approved this kit if you will
these parts that one factory makes so
they can be put together in the field
assembled uh and then transported
because they'd be small enough
you can get your economics of mass
production down
you can get your approval cycle which is
sometimes the biggest problem way down
you can move them to places that are
underserved
because they're small
you could probably put them in areas
that would be let's say have less of an
exclusionary zone just because people
are still afraid of anything nuclear but
if it's a small one
i know
i'm just guessing this is just
speculation but wouldn't that be less
scary
if you said to somebody here's this
giant
domed building
that that looks you know dangerous just
from a distance
with a big stack and there's some kind
of steam coming out you see one of those
things and you think if that baby blows
that's going to take out the whole state
it's not true
but when you look at it it looks like
it looks like it is a bomb
right that big dome
doesn't it look like it
sort of looks like a bomb i mean it
doesn't look like a building does it
but when you make the small ones
you can actually make them
architecturally
cute
they're actually fun to look at they
don't look like anything you know
they're just their own little thing
and imagine if you will
the the psychology of the people who
have to let's say live with these dotted
around the landscape if they see these
cute little ones
and you say to them hey this is the new
technology it's a technology that has
never melted down which would be true of
the current versions
the current version of nuclear is never
melted down
it's only the earlier versions that have
ever had an incident
so
if you told the story
as if it's new
hey people do you remember that old
dangerous nuclear stuff we had there
were these big power plants they even
looked like bombs
most of them were a lot of them not most
of them a lot of them were the old
technology and some of them had some
problems well did you know that the new
technology that they're putting in these
little cute ones
has never had a problem
i mean i guess theoretically they could
but never happened
hasn't happened yet hasn't happened in
any country hasn't happened for
michael schellenberger give me help here
decades i don't know
they've been around a long time just not
in these tiny forms
so if you can solve
the economics
which it looks like
if they get approval it's kind of solved
at least
on the concept level meaning that
that that model could be cloned
and then if you if you get the you know
the regulatory thing which is part of
the economics
um and then if you get the psychology
right
by making them smaller and say oh this
is the new stuff
you're thinking of the old stuff man we
wouldn't put that anywhere
yeah when nobody wants to touch the old
stuff but the new stuff
in the little cube buildings oh you
definitely want those
everybody wants those it's good for
climate change by the way it's
bipartisan
oh it's not even it's not even an issue
of democrat versus republican because it
actually wouldn't be
it wouldn't be
it would actually be bipartisan even
congress is bipartisan non-nuclear
so
if they could really pull this off by
2024
and you know maybe they're off by a year
or two
it's plenty in time
to
get us out of a catastrophic situation
and that's not even counting
the fact that these could be hooked up
to scrubbers
you know once you get the cost of
nuclear down
let's say you take it down
by a factor of 90
could you get down to the point where
you would have your dedicated
scrubber that would suck the co2 out of
the air
have it uh
you know just connect it to one
tiny nuclear plant
and then suddenly the economics of
scrubbing the air
turn positive
because the biggest cost is the energy
so if you solve the cost of producing
the clean energy
tiny nuclear plant
you can suck the hell out of the co2 you
can suck it right out of the air
so you could have tons of suckers
like you could build a like a whole uh
desert full of suckers
with one nuclear power plant and just
suck the entire co2 out of the country
i don't know if it works that way
if you sucked all the co2 out of your
zip code
would it attract co2 from other zip
codes
because it's not like air it's not like
a vacuum
would that even work or would you have
to put all of your suckers and
geographically
dispersed places
it would work a little bit of course i
mean because the co2 isn't going to know
to stop at the border of the zip code
but would it work well enough or would
you really have to spread them out i
don't know maybe we don't know that
all right so the first uh first claim i
believe i've delivered on and by the way
the design for these little nuclear
plants is based on military engines
military nuclear engines
have existed for
you know a long time
it is it's such a well-known technology
so
am i have i delivered on my first claim
and again it's not me doing something i
didn't do anything
but is my first claim not
not persuasive
the climate change
looks a little bit solved doesn't it not
as insult in the past but we now have a
very clear
practical way
to get everything we want
we did it
now there's a lot more work
but there's nothing in the way nothing
there's literally nothing in the way
because follow the money
if they can make these economical how
many can they sell
all of them
all of them right
rolls-royce
is going to be
like one of the biggest companies in the
world
if this works and it looks like it
probably would because there's nothing
really that would stop it from working
that's that's what's different about
this
normally you can look at the situation
and say all right i can see how they can
do a lot of this but how are they going
to get past this big obstacle
there aren't any
there aren't any big obstacles this is
just a big truck driving right down the
highway
toward a solution
that's what it looks like unless there's
something i'm missing here
all right let's talk about netflix the
netflix is actually losing subscribers
and
the stock was down 40 percent and
one of
what they were talking about is maybe
the problem is that people are sharing
their subscription
and so
they would have more growth except for
all the sharing
and maybe it's because the pandemic is
winding down and you know people don't
need to be just indoors all the time but
you know what i think it is
i think it's because
a whole bunch of people signed up to
netflix during the pandemic
consumed everything on netflix that they
wanted to watch
and then
nobody could create enough good content
going forward to ever keep them
satisfied
so i don't think after you after you
after you eat a whole bunch of it
there's not really something to keep you
going
so i guess netflix understands that but
it has more to do with the fact that the
whole genre of movies and scripted tv
just doesn't work anymore
it's just the same movie over and over
again
if it's a drama
or like an action film if it's an action
film there's going to be a car chase
there's going to be somebody strapped to
a chair and tortured it's going to be
three acts it's going to take two and a
half hours and you don't have that kind
of time
so i think the problem with netflix is
what i've been saying for now for a
while
that movies are dead
or dying they're like you know dead men
i just can't imagine movies
being a
legitimate form of entertainment 10
years from now
i think i think movies as an art form
are just going to slide into oblivion
now one of the biggest problems
is the wokeness
have i ever told you this story i for a
couple years i worked pretty hard
on trying to write a script for a really
good dilbert movie
and i got the whole thing you know
storyboarded out and i just needed to
put it on paper and when i looked at it
i i threw away all my two years of work
and
i never want to see it again
because i realized that i'd written a
woke movie i'll leave let me let me tell
you how bad it was
now this was this was still several
years ago so it was before the wokeness
reached the level it is now
so so i could already see it coming
pretty clearly
maybe what five years ago whatever it
was
no longer than that
seven years ago i can't remember
but um
so the script was going to be this so
dilbert would have a number of
big problems in the world that his
company would be involved in and that he
would be involved in you don't need to
know that part but there would be some
kind of master hacker
or there would be like some kind of
technological
presence or entity there had been there
would be guiding things through the
movie so that dilbert would be
suddenly saved from things
and it would be a mystery throughout the
movie who this unknown
technical genius was
now
you would have a hint though early in
the movie there would be some
foreshadowing because you would know
that dilbert's father
had gone to the all you could eat buffet
and never returned
so that dilbert grew up without knowing
his father except for maybe the first
few years or something so you would be
led to believe that his father was
probably some kind of a super genius
you'd meet his mother too who who raised
silver but
she was you know the stay-at-home mom
and
you would presume that whatever dilbert
got that makes him
such a good engineer they probably
got it from his father
and that's you're going to find that his
father's been guiding him the whole time
as sort of the secret entity who's like
a super engineer
and that dilbert's like the the son of
the super engineer and that's and that
would be the big reveal at the end
except
it wasn't
here was the actual big reveal
it was going to be his mom
and that his mom had to pretend not to
be technically
proficient
all her life because of gender
stereotypes
and that in the end
you would see her her back cave and that
she was the one running the whole show
all the time
and then i threw it away do you know why
you see it right
you see it don't you
you see why i had to throw the whole
 thing away
because it wasn't art
it wasn't even close to art all i did
was take a society's expectations and
put them in a forum and then give it
back to him i basically took what people
wanted to see
put a bow on it and handed it back to
him
it was so
creatively empty
that i hated myself for it
like i actually felt dirty
i felt i'd become the enemy
in a way
now
let me be clear
if we had not already entered the the
wokeness era i think it would have been
a great movie
am i right
can you imagine that movie in
1950
it would have killed
it would have been amazing in 1950
right because it would have been a
surprise and you wouldn't see it coming
at all
and then that's why it would be good
and it would you know break gender
stereotypes and stuff but now it would
just be too much it'd just be too much
piling on
so if i uh and i don't think you could
get any other kind of a movie funded i
think your movie would have to have some
woke element to it or climate change
element or something just to even get
funded
so movies i think you're a dead art and
i'm glad i bailed out
although i think it would have made a
lot of money but i'm glad i bailed them
so
i'm not going to make a big deal about
this but because you hate it but cnn is
now saying there's a study that i don't
believe that says that regular masks
protect the wearer i thought we went
through the whole pandemic thinking that
the masks were for the benefit of the
other people it was going to stop the
infected from pluming but now we're
seeing that of course the n95s we always
imagine might be useful so nobody's
going to argue about the n95s i think
everybody says oh if you had a
well-fitted n95
you know that you could change out
regularly and that probably helped you
so everybody agrees with that it's just
these regular like weak surgical masks
and cnn is saying that there was
some tiny little study that said there
was a big difference and the people who
wore the surgical masks
were way less likely to get infected
do you would you believe a study like
that
would you believe that just comparing
people who chose to wear masks
to people who chose not to
is going to get you some kind of a a
useful
useful result
because though you think that the person
who chooses to wear a mask
is also choosing a whole range of
behaviors
that would be compatible with that
mindset
such as do they shake hands
don't you think that people don't wear
masks are more likely to actually like
shake hands
get up close to you
talk to another person up close who
doesn't have a mask on i mean basically
their their entire lifestyle would be
different
so to imagine that this has been proven
in some little study looks to me like
well i'm not sure if it's intentional
disinformation
but it's
i mean it's fake news for sure it's fake
news in the sense that you shouldn't
rely on this study to tell you anything
useful it might be true
that part i don't know
but i wouldn't rely on it and the fact
that they're selling this as a fact
yuck
i wouldn't buy that
all right
um i'm now going to uh
so we've taken care of climate change
to keep my promise i will now handle
systemic racism
systemic racism
with a story
recently
someone asked someone in my social
circle ask me some for some business
advice
now it turns out that because i was a
banker for a long time i made loans to
small businesses i've got an mba
i've started some small businesses of my
own they didn't do well but i learned a
lot
i'm sort of a good person to ask for
general advice about
what to do first if you're starting a
business
and so i gave my advice and you know
i got a i got a nice thank you for it
and
i thought to myself you know it wasn't
like a specific piece of advice it was
like a range of advice
so it wasn't one topic
and i thought to myself
why did this one person get my advice
and and why why does anybody get
anybody's advice
because i'm pretty sure that my success
was dependent on other people's advice
you know i i literally
asked somebody who knew how to be a
cartoonist
how do you get started being a
cartoonist and i followed that advice
and here i am
right so how did i get that advice
that changed the entire course of my
life and i got the advice from somebody
i don't know
complete stranger
well i got the advice by just
approaching the person by a letter and
asking for advice
and i offered nothing in return
there was no quid pro quo i didn't say
i'll buy your advice
i didn't say i'll make you feel good if
you give me some i offered nothing i
literally just asked for something for
nothing
and
i got it
not only did i get the advice but i got
a follow-up advice i didn't even ask for
it was the follow-up advice that i
followed
that got me to
to hear where i'm talking to you
and
and so whenever i get a chance
and somebody asks me for advice i give
it have you ever heard of a comic called
pearls before swine
it's one of the biggest
comics out there
now if you've read
the creator's story
you'll know that his origins story
involves me
so i gave him a good recommendation
early on but he also met with me and
were friends at this point
and
he basically just reached out and said
can you spend some time with me because
he lived locally
and give me some advice and i like i
liked his comics so far what i'd seen so
i did
and he did something weird
he followed my advice
which is weird because i'm actually not
used to it i've given a lot of people
especially artists advice they almost
never follow it
usually they say something like oh thank
you but you know
i have a reason to go a different
direction
okay
but the people who followed my advice
do pretty well and i would say that the
only reason i'm
i'm where i am is that i followed
somebody else's advice somebody knew a
hell of a lot more than i did so i just
followed their advice
so
here's the problem with systemic racism
we keep solving the wrong problem or to
say it better
one part of the problem is already
solved
here's the problem that's already solved
for systemic racism
if you're i'll just pick an example uh a
young black man with an education
do you think he'll do okay
yeah because
every corporation is trying to fix their
or improve their uh their diversity i
mean it's a very stated
important goal i mean you could argue
about the wholeness of it and whether
you know i'm not going to argue whether
they should do it
i think they should but that's not the
argument
the argument is
do they have opportunities the answer is
yeah better than white people that's
just the truth
it's just the truth i'm sorry if it
offends you
if you're a black educated young man you
have a way better chance of getting a
job than the identical white man in the
same situation with the same education
it's not even close
it's not even close and likewise for
getting a college scholarship or even
being accepted in a good college
two equally qualified
young black man young white man same
grades same same s.a.t scores
it's not even close the young black man
wins that contest every time
so if that's so good for the people who
are
who are starting in the hole
aren't we done
because i used to kind of think that
that was my point of view my point of
view is if all these opportunities exist
and you just have to take advantage of
them exactly as i did i went to work for
a big corporation
because when i went there i was still in
demand
they were hiring people like me
so i went there and they trained me and
i was better off for it
so i keep telling myself well i started
with basically nothing
and i went exactly where they can go i
worked in school exactly like anybody
else can why can't everybody else just
do what i did
and one of the reasons is
that some people get advice some people
have mentors
now i sought out mentors
but i don't think that's normal
and i can tell you that people have
sought me out a number of times
do you know who i say yes to almost
every time
guess what what demographic groups do i
say yes to almost every time
black
female
you know hispanic
every time and and do would i more
likely give them advice than somebody i
knew to be you know white and male
i don't know probably not
probably not i'd probably give anybody
advice if they were local and they had a
good reason and i could help them and
yeah the local part's the important part
now i realize i'm opening myself up here
to be attacked by people who want advice
and i have to tell you i just don't have
the time to do most of it
it's you know i do it as i can but there
is people who succeed
and if there's anybody
on here who wants to confirm this if you
have succeeded
let's say financially if you succeeded
aren't you really happy to give advice
like you give it for free
you're happy to do it
look at all the yeses on the locals
platform people are just yes yes yes yes
you want advice
you want to get mentored absolutely so
here's my solution to systemic racism
black people and anybody any person of
color anybody who's you know starting in
a hole for whatever reason
there are plenty of people who give you
advice and it will change your life if
you follow it
you just got to reach out
you just got to ask
and then follow the advice
now i do get
that that's harder
culturally across some boundaries it's
also harder across
gender boundaries
it's easier for a woman to ask a woman
but let me tell you you're really
missing out because men will give you
all the advice you want they'll
mansplain you to death they'll give you
more advice than you ever wanted
it's all free
it's all free
and
you know so so i think the mentoring and
advice connection
is the only thing that needs to be fixed
because if you could catch uh young
black families and i'm going to say the
the parents and especially the mother
if you catch them
early
with the right kind of advice just
connect them to some kind of mentoring
situation
then they can get to the second part
which is the corporations really want to
hire them
and other people too not just
corporations
right so that the the second part of the
plan
for for giving everybody equal
opportunity is is done
the second part's done
it's the first part that doesn't exist
connecting you to people who can just
like nudge you in the right direction
it's the only thing that made me
successful
if you take away the advice
that i got
at key points along the way i'm not here
now what i had going for me is i was
going to go get that advice
right if i had to steal it
i proved it probably would have gone and
gotten it right because i wasn't going
to not succeed i i sort of had a mindset
that
there wasn't any obstacle that was going
to stop me
but
that's also not normal and i don't think
you can teach it
i think it's like a genetic flaw that
has some weird advantages to it
my genetic flaw is that i can't be
satisfied with what i have like i have
to push through the next thing
so it's like a it's like this could you
know it's almost like an illness
and a lot of successful people will tell
you the same thing you don't become
successful and then quit say oh i got
successful
i guess i guess i'm done i'm done
working now i wish it worked like that
but whatever it was that got you there
doesn't turn off you're like ah damn it
so
what about everybody who doesn't have
that flaw
that they just have to keep going i
think you have to find a way that the
mentors find them
to make it easier to get that advice i
don't think you can count on a young
black
kid
to go find some
successful white adult or any successful
adult of any kind
and go ask for advice that's a lot to
ask for a young person
i was willing to do it but it's rare
all right
let's fix um free speech
so let's see systemic racism fixed
climate change fixed we're doing pretty
well so far
we're on we're on target
i'm going to tell you a little very
interesting story that's happening right
now
uh and then i'll tell you how to solve
all of uh fake news and disinformation
so
watching jack dorsey
uh i'm going to say off the leash
meaning he's going full free speech
about free speech
this is so mad at like it's making my
brain hurt
alright so jack dorsey
you know founder and ex-ceo of twitter
uh until now i think he's
he said things that a ceo can say for
the most part
you know things are sort of
you know
as non-controversial as a ceo should be
but now he's not ceo anymore
and
i've told you his his other uh opinions
and he's very free speech
and that's going to be important to
something i'm getting to in a bit but he
had this little exchange with mark
benioff founder of salesforce so benioff
is uh
he is he's pretty awesome guy actually
i've talked about him before so i spent
some time with mark benioff before
giving a talk as salesforce so we got to
chat for a little while and i got sort
of a feel for his vibe and i came away
thinking that he's the real deal
meaning that
he's he's somehow plugged into some
extra dimension in a way that's hard to
explain
that he's just not operating
like normal people there
what you feel is that he's operating at
a higher level of awareness
in which
he has found that capitalism
and being good for people seems to be
compatible
and it's sort of the holy grail how can
you
be a you know a soulless capitalist at
the same time you're trying to take care
of people and somehow
somehow
he's kind of making it work at least
within his world because salesforce has
this
i may be mischaracterizing this but it's
like a
one percent one percent one percent rule
about
everybody should do something for
charity and they and he's really serious
about it and i watched him be serious
about it in person
like i watched him chastise that's too
strong a word but let's say
continuously correct
one of his lieutenants
for not featuring the
uh the the people part of it before the
the business part of it
so um i know that he's serious about it
or i feel that he's serious about so i
don't think he's cynical at all
betting off i think he really wants to
help the world and get rich and it's
working
but
so he uh
he tweeted this
um
so he tweeted a picture so mark benioff
tweets a picture of himself on the cover
of ceo magazine right
which is interesting that you tweet a
cover of himself on ceo magazine but i
guess he's quoting himself saying
capitalism as we have known it is dead
and the obsession that we have with
maximizing profits for shareholders
alone
has led to incredible inequality and a
planetary emergency when we serve all
stakeholders business is the greatest
platform for change
so there's benioff
you know making a call to helping people
but also
you know having a business
be robust and part of the part of the
solution
and uh
then uh jack
re tweeted in reply
you bought this magazine too
now
i didn't realize until i looked it up
that benioff had recently in 2018 i
guess purchased time magazine
so did you
did you know that benioff owned time
magazine i didn't know that
so uh
so here there he is on the cover of ceo
magazine so jack says you bought this
magazine too now what i love about this
is you have to
you have to know about the context and
sort of read between the lines to know
what this is about
and i think this is jack
i think
you know i can't read his mind so this
is always dangerous
but the way i interpret it
is that um jack's
new listen not new but let's say his
i was spoken this about freedom of
speech
is really what this is about
that here's benioff
saying you know the good things he's
doing and showing himself on a magazine
but at the same time he does own a
magazine
and when the rich people own
the the communication channels
then you've got something you need to
look at and so but but they weren't done
with this exchange
so betty off having a good sense of
humor too he responds on twitter he goes
nope
but jack i can get you a subscription to
time and then shows a cover of elon musk
on the cover of time because elon musk
is about to buy twitter so you have to
know all these stories and how
everything connects to know how how
interesting this exchange is
and then it gets better
so
you know you think that would be done
and then uh
jack
jack tweets back
now i'm good man with a photo of uh it's
a meme
of a photo that looks like obama
putting a
medal of honor around obama himself
and like now my my brain is starting to
display i'm like okay i have to decipher
that what does that mean
obama putting a medal a medal of freedom
or something whatever it is on himself
would be like people congratulating
themselves
so it's sort of uh which is just
wonderfully subtle
uh
and then some other user tweeted in you
know got in the middle of some mushrell
and mar and said and tweets uh this took
10 hours
because it took 10 hours for jack to
respond with his obama giving obama
a metal thing
and then jack responds to that by saying
sleep and touching grass took 10 hours
and think okay i understand the sleep
part
[Laughter]
touching grass
[Laughter]
i don't know
it was 419 i don't know what he meant by
touching grass but i assume he meant
going outdoors and and enjoying nature
but uh
so
here's my take on solving disinformation
and fake news
and it's going to dovetail from this
story so this is just an interesting
exchange between two super interesting
people
on a super interesting topic in my
opinion which is freedom of speech and
you know
who controls it
but here's my solution to
solve disinformation
elon musk buys twitter now let's say
that if he gets rejected there's some
some way for him to power ranger up
and just get enough money and super rich
people to say okay we're done playing
around
elon musk is going to buy twitter
with help or without help or one way or
another
so let's say he gets it done
now this is the big f and it depends on
this
the next part
is
the board of directors
now even as a private company you need a
board of directors who could you have as
a board of directors
at twitter
that would make you feel that twitter
had become the first legitimate platform
in terms of getting rid of bias
and therefore as a lever that controls
the other platforms
because if things are correct on twitter
it's hard to to do your fake news
somewhere else because twitter is going
to call you out and all the journalists
are there although all the politicians
are on twitter so you have to get
twitter right
and then you can be fake news and all
the rest
but if twitter is calling out fake news
everywhere left and right
then you just can't get away with it
it's like the lever that controls
everything
so the board of directors in theory
under a musk ownership also in theory
would include a board of directors that
anybody would look at and say
okay that's a pretty good board of
directors
so i'm going to suggest some names
but i don't mean it
all right
the names i'm going to suggest are just
to get you thinking
they're they're not necessarily the
greatest ideas
all right now yes i thought about
putting myself on the board and rejected
it
because why did i reject myself
because i'm not credible
to
a big part of the country so you don't
want a board of directors that isn't
credible that's just recreating the
problem
and i as much as i think i'd be awesome
you know in my my own head i'd be i'll
be awesome for that job like actually i
think that could be useful
but the public would not see it that way
i'm a little too
controversial
so i'm not a good choice
here's something that might be and
before you react
keep in mind that the only thing i'm
looking for is credibility
for free speech
so these are people you don't have to
like in any other context the only thing
you have to say is true about this group
of people is that oh yeah they do like
free speech
like that's the part you don't doubt
okay
first one bill maher
bill maher
say what you say what you will
say what you will about his politics if
you don't like him
can you say for sure that he likes he's
right or die on free speech
he
i know you hate it don't you wait for
the way for the full list
bill maher is ride or die on free speech
i think
um glenn greenwald lives in a different
country
so his credibility is hurt because of
that i thought of him
here's another one and again don't get
hung up on the specific names get get
hung up on the concept of finding people
that would fit this description even if
you don't like these names
second one uh naval ravikant
why
nobody knows his politics
i don't know but he's one of the most
credible people
in all of you know high
high tech world and other people see him
as credible and anybody on the
board would see him that way as too but
there's a better reason
you know what the better reason is
he'd be the canary in the coal mine
all you'd have to do
is wait to see if he quit
if he doesn't quit
nobody's getting away with anything
because he'd see it
right nobody's getting away with
anything if he's still in the board if
he quits all bets are off
the canary is dead
all right so you need one canary now i'm
not saying it's him right
so i'm not saying he'd be the right one
i'm not saying he'd do it
i imagine he wouldn't actually i can't
imagine him do it actually
but you need somebody to be the canary
somebody who is rich enough
and strong-willed enough and independent
enough that if that person quits the
board you've got to say all right we
have to see what's going on now
we have to reopen the hood
right now we don't trust anybody anymore
because that one or canary died
who's the canary
somebody said joe rogan thought of him
he'd be excellent except
he's not considered credible by a lot of
people
unfortunately
uh you're ahead of me tulsi gabbard is
on my list
is she the perfect one i don't know
because you can find reasons to disagree
with her but has she ever been against
freedom of speech
no
oh
there's there's a suggestion like chris
rock
chris rock
say what you will about chris rock do
you like his humor don't like his humor
i love it
but
has crick
do you think chris rock would ever be
against
free speech
doubt it
that and then you've got some you know
add some diversity i think that'd be
good
uh here's the one that's going to fool
you
i would add to the board
jack dorsey
you didn't see that one coming did you
he's perfect
nobody knows more about the company
and coming in as a board member would
just scare the out of him
he's already criticized the board he's
the last person that the current board
would want on the board
and do you know who i'd want on the
board
of a new of a new board if let's say
musk owned it i'd want somebody that the
old board definitely didn't want on
there i mean that would seem like a
feature to me
i don't know if they would want him or
not but
um
yeah so jack dorsey
is unambiguously
in favor of free speech
he's just able to say it now because
he's not a ceo so he can you can say it
in a more
in a more clear and you can tell that
it's
you can tell that he's emotionally
attached to it it's not just talk
and the way he's reacting to it
shows that he's in the fight you know
he's not a bystander
uh i will throw in mark andreessen
um
if you're not familiar with his name you
should google him
i don't need to explain to everybody
mark cuban there's that's interesting
mark
cuban yeah i could say that
because mark cuban has that same i mean
i would imagine he's a free speech
absolutist
i haven't asked him i haven't seen him
talk about it but i would
imagine um
and
he would be a canary too
i think i think he would be a canary
because i think he would quit the board
if they did something that was
unambiguously anti-free speech you don't
think he would quit the board or if he
couldn't see what he was on the board of
if he didn't have visibility that made
him feel comfortable the things were
okay yeah i think he would quit the
board
good name all right
molly hemingway
too too controversial too political i
mean people would see her as political
although she would be great
yeah so you have to you have to um
you have to separate who would be great
in terms of qualified with who would be
great and qualified but also
would look like it from the outside it's
dave chappelle
good suggestion you know
chris rock has the same quality which is
you want a comedian in there
because they like free speech and the
left likes comedians
so
and the right does as well
chappelle is a really good name
yeah
dave rubin
dave rubin dave rubin unambiguously free
speech
um unambiguously you can see both sides
of
the left and the right
good name
um how about all right i i'm going to
end with
the most controversial one
i want one that just makes your head
explode okay you ready you ready for
this one
aoc
go on go on let your heads explode
now is it because i agree with aoc's
policies nope nope nope nope nope
is it because i think she is a
keen observer and
knows how to get things done
no
but
has she ever
has she ever spoken out against free
speech
do you know what is interesting about
aoc
she's like a huge victim of
free speech
but i'll bet she backs it
now i don't know this right now remember
remember you don't have to agree with
any of the names because they're not
real
they're not real suggestions they're not
my suggestion
i'm just throwing out controversial
ideas
right the the positive way to have aoc
would be to say you know
if aoc is okay with this
and the other people are okay with it it
must be okay right because you'd want at
least one person on there
who's
who's just gonna you know shake the box
every now and then
so it doesn't have to be her
somebody said geraldo
geraldo i would take geraldo
yes i would trust geraldo
to be a honest broker of what makes
sense on the left of the right
now again i don't agree with geraldo on
every one of his opinions but that's not
the issue
i think he's an absolutist on free
speech
and would seem like it
to a lot of people
all right so that is my solution to free
speech fixed twitter you fixed
everything if musk buys twitter he could
put a board put together a board that
the public would respect
that fixes everything
am i right
or at least it's worth trying if you get
a b test a solution to disinformation
this is the way i'd do it
compare that to obama's
foundation that he's created to battle
this information
would you trust barack obama's
disinformation battling uh foundation
it's the obama foundation we're working
to empower and equip emerging leaders to
tackle issues like the spread of
disinformation no they're not
he's literally
the most political person in the world
he's the last person who should be
touching disinformation
he's literally the provider of it or you
know he's the
the most famous symbol of the people who
provide it
um now i'm not saying the right doesn't
have any disinformation
but nobody is more associated with it
than this guy
and that's not even a criticism of obama
as a president it's just
talk about the wrong guy for the job
right you know just as i was saying that
these people for the
an imaginary board of twitter would be
the right people
sometimes that's really the wrong person
all right
there's a story that russian
russians are
making ukrainians in ukrainian conquered
territory
fight other ukrainians in other words
they're forcing
the ukrainians under their control to
join the military and go fight other
ukrainians
i'm not so sure that's exactly
correct
that sounds a little uh
propaganda-ish but it does seem true
that there are examples in which russia
has in the past
use ukrainians and their military force
fighting ukrainians but it was in
territory that they'd held a while
meaning that they probably had a better
handle on who they could trust and who
they couldn't
but i don't know about giving a gun to
somebody you conquered yesterday
all right yesterday yesterday we were
shooting at you really tried hard to
kill you killed a lot of people in your
in your entity but i'll tell you what
we're going to give you a gun it's going
to have real ammo and you're going to be
on our side now
and if you don't we'll shoot you
and you're like
you're like holding this gun you're like
okay you're the guys who murdered all
the people in my troop
and we're gonna go out in that fire
fight
where nobody knows where any bullet is
coming from
and you think i'm going to fight i'm
going to be shooting him at my team
explain to me how that works because you
were shooting at me
yesterday
[Laughter]
one of those bullets went
right by my head
i don't think i'm going to be shooting
in that direction
i mean i might point my gun there until
the until the shooting starts
but it should as soon as the shooting
starts i'm going to be like
[Laughter]
now to me it looks like fake news
fake news that's close enough to real
news that
places where they've controlled it long
enough maybe they can get people that
they trust
to be in the military i i just it just
feels propaganda-ish to me i wouldn't
buy that on face value
all right uh
rasmussen hezbollah asking people if
women should fight on the front lines
and perform all combat duties
59 percent now say yes the women should
fight on the front lines
now some of you will interpret this as
um
men becoming more woke or
maybe women too
and that there's there's much more
equality
and
this is you know not we're not there yet
not to 100 people saying it would be
fine depend no matter what your gender
but you can see that there's a big
push
toward
much more wokeness and open-mindedness
no that's not what's happening i think
people just hate women
and
i think there are just more people who
you say to them in a poll do you think
women should go to the front lines and
be torn to pieces by shrapnel
i think just more people are willing to
say
yeah them
i don't know
i i just don't know
i just don't know that the survey is
picking up exactly what you think
i'm not saying that's my opinion
i'm just saying we're living in such a
contentious world
that i don't know that equality is
what's driving this number
i think it's kind of yeah i don't care
yeah the what about all the in-cells all
the men who have given up women forever
because they can't get a date and
it's only the top two percent of men on
tinder who are getting all the action
you don't think some of those men who
have been completely abandoned by women
in the sense that it's useless to even
try to get one for them you don't think
that they're saying yeah i don't care
you could send them all to the front
line i don't care it wouldn't affect my
life one way or the other
all i'm saying is you have to be careful
about how you interpret
these
these things
there's a story about taylor lorenz a
reporter for the washington post and i
don't care
so i'm going to skip that one
but one of you know i heard about it
just isn't interesting
once again i seem to be in every story
there's a story in the evening standard
british publication about mps that are
going to vote on whether whether a boris
johnson should be investigated for a
misleading parliament about i don't know
what
and the story leads out with a story
about me
what the hell
what the hell
how do i get in this story about boris
johnson and some damn thing
but they were quoting some past thing
that i talked about
um
student debt 52 of likely u.s voters
support biden's uh plan to cancel
student debt
so that makes it a good idea right
politically this would be good for biden
because the majority of people agree
with it right
is that right because a majority agree
so therefore it'd be a good thing to do
because that's how politics works
if the majority like it
you want to do it right
no not in this case do you know why
because there are too many people who
will really really be mad about this
you don't want to do something that's
good for people if it makes
even the minority of people so mad that
they'll change their vote
i don't think too many people are going
to vote for this
just to save money i don't think too
many people are going to say well if i
get biden they'll save some money but
i'll bet there'll be a lot of people who
vote against him if he doesn't
i would be kind of mad
yeah i i've paid off
somebody else's student loans actually
so
uh i helped a let's say a loved one pay
off student loans
and i'd be pretty pissed if i wasted my
money
pretty best
all right
i gotta imagine that there's some
democrats who have paid their own
student loans we're not gonna like this
at
all i feel like there was something i
missed now have i solved all the
problems
let's see what did i promise you um i
promised you
that uh i would solve uh climate change
okay fake news i solved with a twitter
board if musk buys them
systemic racism through mentoring oh and
then poverty well poverty will be solved
by
the small nuclear making energy costs go
down
if you fix the fake news then you can
get real solutions instead of fake ones
and if you fix systemic racism with the
mentoring uh that eventually fixes
poverty so i believe i got all four
climate change fake news poverty
systemic racism in one live stream
and i did that on 420
and let me tell you
i couldn't have done it without the
simultaneous
whatever
so
how many people think i delivered did i
deliver
have i delivered four solutions not that
i made up myself
before solutions
that actually would work
that's right nailed it now that doesn't
mean these will all be implemented just
the way i said but we do have the
solutions
isn't it isn't it fun to know
that even if they don't get solved
we do know how
we do know how to solve all this stuff
now we just have to do it
all right
no doubt this is the highlight of
all live streams ever
the best thing that anybody's ever done
anywhere
and
probably
you would like to close with one more
simultaneous
whatever
and those of you watching asynchronously
as in recorded
you
you want to go with this one you want to
you want to join us it's going to make
you feel better
you ready
let's do the simultaneous
whatever
i'm being criticized for not curing
wokeness
i think wokeness is curing itself
and wokeness seems self-curing
wokeness simply has to go too far
can you count on wokeness to go too far
oh yeah
oh yes you can
and when it goes too far and it has
then
it will bounce back yeah the wokeness is
a um
the the thing that will kill wokeness
is this realization
that the wokeness is hurting
the people it's meant to help
let me give you a general concept
that is really important
in the early in the early days of
greatest discrimination
you wanted to use the harshest tool like
a civil war to end slavery for example
and then the civil rights was a pretty
big tool you could put people in jail
for violating people's civil rights and
sue people for stuff that's a pretty big
tool
and that that was important because the
problem was you know that size
but as you get down to like more subtle
things like who has a mentor and
systemic
racism and stuff
at that point
when you're talking about a strategy
difference
because that's really what we're down to
we're down to a strategy difference can
you find a mentor
because if you can
everything else is in place
just a strategy just just get that
mentor
so once you've got it down to a strategy
place the wokeness is anti-productive
do you do you want to be a young black
man and you get a good job
and everybody around you thinks that it
was affirmative action
messed up right that's messed up that
works against you that works against you
so
at what point do you get to the point
where the discrimination part
although discrimination and bigotry will
always exist right there's going to be a
baseline of that but the actual problem
part economically just economically
it's all just down to a strategy now a
really simple one
connect mentors to people who need it
and then take their advice that's it
so i would say that uh this is the time
when wokeness will overshoot because the
thing is trying to solve is just making
a mockery of things that now have
solutions that are more like strategy
and less like oh there's a gigantic in
in injustice that somebody is
perpetrating specifically and
consciously it's not that anymore and
that ladies and gentlemen is the end of
the show for youtube you're all
wonderful and man
i can't help but mention this you're
sexier than i ever seen you before
my goodness you look good
you must have gotten a good night's
sleep last night
bye for now
