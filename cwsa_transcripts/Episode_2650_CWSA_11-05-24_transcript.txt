[Music]
try number three had a little technical
difficulty
there but looks like the stock market is
zooming
today anticipating a trump win
perhaps perhaps
maybe let's get our comments
going if you're on the X Network you'll
notice that your dilber comic has the
wrong date on it but otherwise it's
great
[Music]
no wait this one
better choice one
or Choice two Choice
two good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called offy with Scott Adams I know
I'm Scott Adams I know no this is the
disguise no seriously I'm Scott Adams
I'm not Trump I'm not I'm not I know it
looks exactly like
it but uh you're probably already
realizing that this experience is a peak
experience one of the best days of your
life good we we like number two good
good and
let's see if these comments are working
oh yes comments are working everything's
working
today and if you'd like to take your
experience up the levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cup or
mug or a glass of tanker chel a St a
canteen jug or flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee so join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine trick of the
day and the sip of the day
God everything's wrong this
morning that that looks like the comment
stopped the Technologies didn't work I
got all the dates on my Comics
wrong uh but besides that it's going
great yeah it looks like uh I don't
think this is working at all
actually see I have no feedback right
now
so let's see if any comments are coming
in any coms
coms seems to be a problem with the
comments unless they coming in at the
top
huh uh no that's a live stream that
ended that's why I can't see
it so looks like I've given myself
another technical problem which I can
fix very
quickly or maybe not maybe not
today oh my
God oh my God I really can't fix
it what date do I have in the comic
today or what date do I have on on
this can you see a date
let's see there's the pre-show there it
is all right we had a little problem on
locals there it
is all right well I have no idea how
much you've seen of
me but it's working right now here's
your simultaneous
sip well I think it's a good sign for
the election because personally I've
never had so many things go wrong within
a 10-minute
period every part of my production went
wrong in 10 minutes uh all the comics
were wrong just
everything but that is not a harbinger
of things to
come because I'm feeling the luck
today all right let's start with the
little science and then of course will
be talking about the
election today's the 5th right November
5th for those of you who are new to me
if anybody is I have a bizarre mental um
disability and it's it's a pure
disability it's not I'm not joking about
it I can't keep dates
straight
so this morning somebody pointed out
that I had the wrong date on my comic
which is normal you know maybe one and
three times I put the wrong date on
it but attempting to fix it put me into
a mental spin that I couldn't get out of
because I have a mental problem with
dates so uh everything's off right now
but uh let me tell you something that I
got right makes me feel good there's a
new study that found there's H little
evidence to support the validity of what
they call the five love
languages where did you hear that first
who is the first person to tell you that
the Love Languages was pure
 that would be me yes you didn't
really need to do a study i' I've been
saying this for years it's obviously
pure um so they could have just
asked me nobody wants to talk about
anything except Trump today so I'll just
zip through this uh Trump's final
messages his closing
argument I would summarize this way
we don't have to live this
way and if you vote for him the golden
age will be
unlocked and that's a pretty darn good
message pretty darn good I like that
he's going to bring us to the Golden Age
I like that he's going to make America
healthy again I like it he's going to
make America great
again now I know a lot of you are filled
with
trepidation and the one thing I like to
tell you is that it's you know you've
heard the saying it's always darkest
before the
dawn we can't tell the difference
between the beginning of great news and
the beginning of bad news we just don't
have that ability but we are on the
verge of
both if Harris wins I consider that very
bad news for me personally as well as
the
country if Trump wins I think the
potential is almost unlimited
Mars is the uh I we're literally looking
at Mars
um but how do you
feel if it makes you feel any better I
feel Trump's going to
win I do feel that the cheat is in I do
feel that there will be attempted cheats
in individual places and I think they'll
get
caught and it might be that it's too big
to cheat anyway
so we could get everything we want which
is Trump as president Harris off of the
stage and
maybe a very good argument that 2020 was
also corrupt because if we catch some
big ones this time it's going to be
really hard to argue that last time it
was clean you know what I
mean now I don't I don't know what the
where the the line is is if they find a
few hundred fake votes that doesn't say
anything about the last election if they
find a few
th000 doesn't really say anything about
the last
election if they
find
20,000 then the the last election was
rigged to especially if they find it in
a place they wouldn't have looked in
2020 then then the story gets a little
clear
but uh today will be a serious mental
illness day in the country um and
certainly whoever loses is going to be
in distress uh we we hope that uh you're
on the winning team and that and that
what you see is nothing but fun but uh
here's a quote from zubie you all know
zubie right do I have to explain who
zubie is or is he now officially famous
enough that I can just use him by one
name and everybody goes oh zuie
I think he's famous enough right if you
don't know he's uh he's one of my
favorite Talent stack people because
he's good at just a whole bunch of
things but one of them is social media
one is music one is
interviews uh um physical fitness he's
just got a whole bunch of skills that he
puts together and here's what he said
this morning imagine still having Trump
derangement syndrome after nine years
lol especially as a man
pathetic pathetic is is a persuasion
term for men I don't know if it works
for a woman it might I just don't know
one way or the other but when a man
hears the word
pathetic used used against him it's
really
powerful because there's you would
rather be you'd rather be a mass
murderer than be pathetic because at
least you did something right you know
so so the male the male wiring is that
being pathetic is the only thing you
can't be you could be a Mongol horde you
could be a you know
criminal you could do all kinds of bad
things but you don't want to be pathetic
yeah it's as bad as it
gets well noal ravikant has weighed in
in a way that I think is the most
clear uh
endorsement and let me let me read it to
you he says I think he said this this
morning or last night leaders come and
leaders go but don't change the rules of
the game censorship censorship is
changing the rules of the game lawfare
is changing the rules of the game
importing voters is changing the rules
of the game time to change the people
who are changing the rules of the
game now is that just the best summary
you've ever heard
yes the country can stay unified if we
play by the same rules and somebody wins
by those rules and somebody loses by
those rules under those conditions we
are a healthy enough country that we can
say damn it I'll get you next time and
then we just do the best we can we're in
a whole different world now the the
Democrats have done the Kobayashi Maru
they're just cheating they're just
changing the the rules whoever wins this
time might be the result of whoever
changed the rules the best because
that's probably what happened last
time
and this warning from
nval um is comes as close as you can get
to an endorsement for
Trump which is phenomenal in and of
itself I mean if you don't know who Nal
is he's not
political and for him to become
political
at at tremendous personal risk is a big
deal it's a big deal there is bravery
popping up all over the
place this is one
example next Joe Rogan has officially
endorsed Trump
today it's
official Joe
Rogan biggest podcaster most successful
probably has a lot to lose
just said it not in naval's in Joe
Rogan's
in Megan
Kelly Megan Kelly attended the Trump
rally in the final day she's fully in
fully endorsing him there's a there's a
beautiful picture of the two of them
just hugging for a selfie that
uh it's just
beautiful and the reason it's important
is that she was famous for the first
debate where she asked the question
about his interaction with women and he
did the only Rosie O'Donnell move which
ultimately ended up in in a you know
affecting her career in a big way
negatively and uh she's
still she's still on this side I mean it
probably took a little while to to
Circle back but that's a big
deal but who's on Harris's side well
Oprah decided to do a Big Show and she
said quote last night she said it is
entirely possible that we will not have
the opportunity to ever cast a ballot
again I think she was also talking about
Trump winning and rounding up the hosts
of MSNBC and some other really batshit
crazy stuff now when I see Oprah who I
consider to be an unusually intelligent
person so if you're going to if you're
going to do do an IQ test and and Oprah
was on the other side of the table good
luck she's very smart I mean she's
proved it for
years but when she talks like this does
she sound like she's
Oprah this doesn't even sound like Oprah
this sounds like some imitation Oprah or
somebody who's being brainwashed or or
blackmailed or something and so I don't
know what the situation is that would
make Oprah go from one of the smart more
useful people in all of America to be
whatever this
is but my best guess is that she's got a
a Dy problem she's probably being
blackmailed it's just a guess it's not
based on any data or information but to
see her act so far and of
character when when Trump was actually
like her friend at one point um suggest
she's under
duress because she had nothing to lose
by a trump in fact she would have made
money probably because she's one of the
rich people she would have done better
on taxes I suppose so for her to be this
strong and this irrationally
crazy it it's almost like she's trying
to signal that she's under dress you
know when the uh when the Black the
people were kidnapped are trying to send
signals when they're sending the
videotape you know the win it's like
she's going so far into Crazy Land that
it's to tell you that she has no choice
that's what it feels like now can I read
her mind no I cannot is it possible that
her thoughts are just compatible with
lots of other women in in the country
yes it
is but it doesn't look like
it what it looks like is she's under
dress now I don't say that about
everybody because there are lots of
people are just team players people have
always been Democrats people are dumb
people you know there are lots of
reasons to support some I don't
support but when somebody who's smart
and productive and successful does this
that just looks bad
crazy I say it's either
brainwashing or duress it's one of those
two
things so Obama decided to uh support uh
Harris I think it was yesterday he went
out and went strong on the fine people
hoax the fine people
hoax after as been the most debunked
hoax in all of the United States the
most famous lie in the United States
it's the big lie and he went out and
said it in public like it was
true now I would like to publicly do a
face
plant I supported Obama at one
point um and I've only been registered
as a Democrat I think for most of my
life and when he ran for president I
thought ah wouldn't it be good to have
some cool
calm obviously very
smart guy who is also black so we could
just get past that and then forever more
we could say see it's not it's not about
color you just have to be you know good
like Obama was and you can be
president but when I see him go out and
do the most destructive hoax in the
history of
America with no qualms at all apparently
just says it like it's true and knows it
isn't I've got to say he's a piece of
 uh everything I thought about him
being maybe a good person who you know
not always had the plans that I like the
most but you I thought he was a good
person who meant well he's not a good
person he doesn't mean well he's a piece
of so he is forever dead to me as
an American president that I'll ever
refer to with any respect whatsoever so
I have no respect for the man whatsoever
and I think that he just destroyed all
the Goodwill of being the first black
president so I wanted the first black
president to be successful kind of
matters you know it matters because it's
one of the big things that divides the
country wouldn't it be great if your
first black president even if you didn't
agree with his policies you could say
but at least he was a an honorable
respected man nope he's not honorable I
don't respect him and I think this is a
disgrace to the country and an
embarrassment frankly just frankly an
embarrassment and uh as I've said
jokingly but not uh every day that he's
he doesn't correct himself on the fine
people hoax I'm going to say his wife
has a
 I don't think she
does but it's as it's as easy to believe
as to find people HS so we're just going
to call it the same thing your wife has
a Obama and uh maybe you should
clean up your
act Joe Joe Rogan had uh Elon Musk on
yesterday on the show I think that was a
surprise but musk says if K wins uh the
boycuts against X will get stronger and
uh maybe X would go out of
business and then if you turn over to um
MSNBC Rachel madcow is saying that if
Harris
wins that musk should expect to lose all
of his government contracts and be put
in a business because he's too
dangerous this is
real this is real that the most
successful person in the world if you
know certainly the
country is actually going to be taken
out he's actually be taken out they're
going to destroy his businesses they
will destroy the number one free speech
well really the only free speech
platform and even our even our uh
dominance of
space yeah
so this is the scariest thing you've
ever
seen so Elon is saying to vote like your
life depend depends on it because it
does and elon's encouraging men to get
out there because women are apparently
outpacing um and he says you're not done
yet if you haven't driven your friends
to vote if you have voted and you know
somebody who hasn't voted you're not
done you all get that right if there's
anybody you know who's registered to
vote and they haven't voted you're not
done your work is not done you got to
make sure those people vote
drive them don't bribe them that's
illegal
but push them poke them drive them do
what you got to do got to get it done
today uh so here let's look at the uh
let's see if we can pick up any tea
leaves see if we can see if there's
anything in the wind that's telling us
what's coming so the Google CEO this
would be a Sundar pich he sent a UR
companywide email I I read this on Mario
Na's expost uh companywide email
yesterday telling employees that Google
must remain quote a trusted source of
information regardless of election
outcome well first of all that's
hilarious they can't remain a trusted
source of information are you telling me
that the CEO of Google doesn't know that
they're no longer a source of trusted
information
that does he really not know that or is
he just saying this but he does know
that certainly half of the country
believes that they're
Liars that they're just hiding
information for some benefit of from
themselves so no not only do we not
trust the information on Google we think
many of your employees are just
liars see if you can fix
that
but there's more to this story so that
warning that that Google CEO gives to
its own people that warning comes after
a phone call with Trump uh in which the
CEO of Google um personally called him
uh to discuss the search popularity and
uh yeah I guess the I guess he wanted to
make Trump feel comfortable that Google
was not playing any games now nobody
believes they're not playing any games I
don't personally know if they are or
they're
not but everything I see suggests that
they're still playing exactly the same
games as always however so after he
talked to Trump
allegedly uh Trump threatened to
prosecute Google for alleged election
interference did that really
happen did the CEO of Google called
Trump to say everything's fine we're not
we're not biasing it and did Trump say
if you do you're going to
jail did he do that God I hope he did I
mean I want that to be true it sounds
like you know this sounds a little too
too on the nose necessarily to be true
but I so want that to be
true
um but the uh the the source is the
Washington
[Laughter]
Post The Washington Post is the least
Dependable uh Source outside of Google I
guess so you can't believe that that's
true but I'd love to believe
it um and uh allegedly some of the uh
some of the platforms are pulling back
on their finger on the on the scale
we'll see we'll see I don't believe that
the platforms have backed off I think
they may have just gotten more clever
about
it the Georgia Supreme Court ruled I
think it was yesterday that uh ballots
submitted after election day will not be
counted the Daily Caller was
reporting
um so that seems like a big deal doesn't
it
that they won't count ballots that are
after the
deadline now there are more rules
changes lately you've all heard them
right there been been a bunch of court
rulings and decisions about who does
what and who can who can count what
votes where and who's observing and all
that
stuff but doesn't it seem to you that
we've we're already past the point where
voters
decide we're at the point where the only
thing that makes the decision is the
rules so the rules are changing right up
to the day of the election literally the
day of I mean this was yesterday's
decision and the rule changing will
completely determine who wins so if
Georgia had not changed this rule the
day before the election could this have
been the difference between who was
president yes yes and a bunch of other
states are making changes too and there
so everything that's changing
sort of gets back to uh you know nal's
point they're changing the rules they're
changing the game now in this case it's
a change that I like because it's
changing back to where it should have
been
but we don't really have a system where
the voters are
deciding let me explain the
system how was it that I could predict
one year in advance that no matter who
the candidates were that the polls would
be tied today how did I do that how did
I pull off that
Miracle it was easy you just observe the
system is is designed to make sure that
the polls converge at the last minute to
make you feel that there's something
like a real election going on but the
polling is you know to manipulate and
also to cover up any bad behavior I
assume now if your elections are always
going to be razor thin close
then what determines them is the rules
so if somebody's allowed to count some
late votes if somebody's allowed to
include some people who may not be
citizens if somebody's not taking ID if
somebody's not allowing some observers
in one
place those are the things that will
determine who's the president because
everything else is
tied so the the effect of all the rules
changes are now this big and the effect
of the voters is now this big because
we're we're
tied so it's only the rules changes that
are determining who the president is
it's just the lawyers so the lawyers are
basically battling it
out so you hope that the Republican
lawyers had a better year than they did
in 2020
right all right uh here are some more
hints that things might be rigged in
advance uh and by the way apparently the
platforms all allow people to speculate
about rigging now and that used to be
you couldn't do it because if you
speculated that something was rigging
was rigged uh with or without
information uh with or without facts um
you would get demonetized and and
disappeared but apparently they're
allowing it now which is a benefit to
free speech but uh so I'm going to do
that uh I'm going to I'm going to give
you several things you should look for
if a rig has planned right so if there's
going to be rigging it's already
planned and if it's already planned you
might be seeing some signals early what
would those signals look like now I
can't guarantee that there's rigging how
would I know but we can look to see if
there are any signals that you would
expect if there was going to be rigging
so here's what I'd expect I would expect
that on Election Day or right about
election day there would be at least one
major poll showing that Harris will
win you need that right because you
can't have every poll and every betting
Market go one way and then the election
go the other way so if a rig is if a rig
is in the the mix there has to be some
illegitimate player somebody that you
already know is illegitimate so this is
key it has to be somebody that you
already know is
illegitimate and or at least not
credible and they come up with a big oh
Harris is going to win and sure enough
The Economist which is a publication
which is not credible when it comes to
politics let's say uh did a model which
they did some kind of iterative model to
see under what conditions who would win
and they found out that Harris wins most
of the
time now do you think that the model
that they built would pass any kind of
analysis by independent
people
no I doubt it it would be about as
Dependable as the climate models anytime
anybody tells you they have a secret
model that's predicting the
future you should hold your wallet
because somebody's somebody's playing a
scam on you right so right on time
exactly as you would expect if the
election were rigged you would see a
major publication something you've heard
of that sounds important like The
Economist say oh we've got a new model
and our new model shows that really
surprisingly Harris wins okay right on
time now that's not proof that anything
is rigged I'm just saying that you all
agree if they were planning to rig it
they would have to have at least one
illegitimate but legitimate sounding
publication say that Harris is supposed
to
win and they didn't use a poll they used
a
model all right what are we looking at
here
um here's a quote from Joe Rogan the
Great and Powerful Elon Musk if it
wasn't for him we'd be effed he makes
what I think is the most compelling case
for Trump you'll hear
and yes for the record that's an
endorsement of trump so so Joe Rogan is
doing his endorsement today good for you
Joe I appreciate
that yes the economist is the Atlantic
of the Washington Post that is right
Yanks Yanks 28 so what
else um you would also want to see a
contrarian prediction that Harris would
sweep all of the Swing States because
you know the swing States look like
they're going to Trump so you also need
something that doesn't just say the
popular vote you need somebody to come
out and say I think I think she's going
to win all seven swing States and
today uh on CNS David plof the head of
the Harris campaign said she could win
all swing
States that's a interesting thing to say
isn't it she could win all the swing
States when Trump is ahead on all the
swing States
huh how can how can how can they come up
with something like she's going to win
all the states where she's
behind is that possible I think Trump
did because there were the you know shy
Trump voters but how would they explain
it well there's this new thing that I
haven't heard before called late
deciders have you heard of the late
deciders you know the all the the data
coming in about the late
deciders yeah it turns out that the late
deciders are
overwhelmingly in favor of Kam LA haris
but why why would the people who made up
their their mind at the end be
overwhelmingly in in favor of one person
when they were sort of on the fence the
whole time that's the whole point they
went from on the fence to overwhelming
well no we have a reason
people if there were no reason for it
then it wouldn't make sense at all would
it but thank God there's a reason do you
know what the reason is it's because KL
Harris's closing argument was so strong
compared to
Trump's oh come
on literally nobody made their vote
depend on the closing
argument literally nobody but you have
to have that argument for why things
changed magically at the last minute so
we've got the magical bullet argument
that her magical excellent clothes
which was no more capable than all of
her her blabbering idiocy for the entire
campaign but boy did she close strong
and her cloth was so strong that
persuasion alone persuasion alone made
all these late deciders go oh well you
got me now you got me now now that's
exactly what you'd expect to hear if the
rig was
planned they would have to have a
narrative that explains it and there it
is the narrative is she closed strong
she was a better campaigner I guess
those celebrity endorsements really do
work despite all evidence to the
contrary Oprah probably made the
difference oh it's probably the Oprah
fact yeah opr when Oprah endorser that
that may have taken all those people on
the edge pushed him right over no
anybody who hadn't made up their mind
the day before election day isn't going
to be influenced by
Oprah whatever it is that caused them to
be undecided
it wasn't the lack of
Oprah yeah yeah and then there was the
Iowa fake poll I think I can call that
fake because it's just so obviously fake
so the Iowa fake poll gives them cover
that there was at least one poll that
showed she really had come from behind
at that last
minute late deciders and then then you'd
expect David Axelrod and people like him
the you know The Luminaries and the
smart people on the Democrat side to say
stuff like this David oxar said that
Donald Trump is quote not closing
well see so that's the narrative Harris
had this beautiful closing argument with
Oprah but Trump he was just you know
dancing on stage with his customers
um
anyway then if I thought I was looking
for indications that would be
rigging I'd look
for this in the news this sentence quote
we don't know how long it will take to
have a final
result after hundreds of years of
Elections we can't figure out how to get
a result on Election Day as the
technology improves we get
worse now do you think that they would
be telling us we wouldn't have a you
know they'd be warning us oh you're not
going to have a result on Election
Day if it was a fair
election maybe maybe but it's exactly
what you'd expect if it were
rigged now remember all of these are
just circumstantial the the evidence I'm
giving just circumstantial none of these
prove anything's rigged there all
exactly what you'd expect to see if it
was rigged and they're not things that
you've seen often for example the late
deciders I I literally never heard of
that before maybe that's has that been
even mentioned in other campaigns that
there are late
deciders so that one's that one really
sticks out to
me um then then what we'll look forward
is also for the classics you know what
the classics are right so these are the
things that have happened before and
they're going to happen again because
nothing happened the last time they
happened so the
classics some machines are going to
malfunction do you want to bet against
that does anybody want to place a bat
that says all the machines will work or
do you think that there'll be some
important precincts where the machines
malfunction do you think that's going to
happen yes there will be important
places where the machines
malfunction now there's one there's one
report of someplace that happened that
didn't seem that important but look for
a swing state look for at least one
swing state to have some kind of
emergency something with the building
maybe there's a bomb threat you know
maybe a maybe a fire or a water leak and
they just got to shut down that system
and kick out The
Observers the classics
how about this one now this hasn't
happened but I'm expecting it do you do
you think that anybody will report any
suspicious delivery vehicles in which
the drivers refuse to say who they work
for or what's in the
truck do you think that's going to
happen look for suspicious delivery
vehicles these are the classics the
classics now I'm not saying that the
suspicious Vehicles will even
necessarily have any anything to do with
the election but you can guarantee that
there'll be reports of suspicious
vehicles that may or may not have
suspicious ballots in them we'll never
know but that's
coming uh and then how about the Capper
the the the one that tells it
all sometime today you're can to hear a
story about Republican observers being
physically barred from watching
something you know that's happening
right there will be some report now
again the report might be fake and it
might be an unimportant thing that's
being discussed that sounds important
but there will be reports today of
Republicans
um of Republicans being uh barred now I
saw in the comments somebody's worried
that I'm blackpilling you so you don't
vote no you need to vote so that any any
cheating is more obvious the the more
votes Trump gets the more obvious any
cheating will become and if it's too
little it won't be enough so yes the the
more I tell you that it might be a Rigg
the more you have to vote so that just
just to be clear on that this is an
argument to vote vote as hard as you
can Pennsylvania county gives an update
according to just news and you heard
there were these 2500 suspicious voter
registration forms that got flagged in
Lancaster County and so far they've
confirmed that 177% of the forms are
fraudulent well that's exactly what
you'd expect to hear if an election
upcoming were
rigged but Rob Schmidt of Newsmax tells
us that 44 years ago the polls had card
and Reagan neck and neck and Reagan won
4 44
States so the polls haven't been
accurate since at least then but I would
point
out that uh that when Reagan beat Carter
unexpectedly and the poll said otherwise
that was a case where the guy who was
going to build up the most military got
elected over the guy who wanted the
least
military now if you believe that uh the
real power behind the Thrones are always
the the money people and the
military-industrial complex then I would
say 44 years ago we have pretty strong
indication that the election was rigged
by the
CIA because what would give you all the
polls saying it's close and then Reagan
winning in the
landslide cheating yeah I think there's
a pretty good chance that Reagan um
Reagan was a rigged
election if you look but I've I've done
this before but if you look at the
presidents who have
won it's been in different parties
sometimes Republican sometimes not but
the thing they have in common is the
ones who want to spend the most on the
military-industrial complex seem to win
you know
unexpectedly so since I assume that our
own uh Spooks who rig elections in other
countries would be perfectly capable of
doing it in in America if they were so
inclined I would say that the the Reagan
um Landslide over Carter might have been
a rigged
election what do you think do you think
the election was rigged or do you think
the polling all the polling was
wrong I don't know it depends if there
was any polling that was right I suppose
if there were a few polls that people
knew to be accurate and they showed that
uh Carter was going to win
then I'd suspect that it was rigged so
look at the people who have won so you
got
Reagan who wins in my in my opinion it
was a suspicious Victory it's kind of
suspicious right any anytime the poll
doesn't match the outcome is suspicious
now in the case of trump it was not
suspicious because we knew full well
that there were secret Trump supporters
because they were so they were so
vilified that it was obvious they
weren't answering the questions to the
posters so at least when Trump had the
unexpected Victory the reasons were
really obvious people would just tell
you no I lied to the pollster yeah yeah
I did that I lied to the
pollster I don't know that that was the
case in Reagan's day do you think people
lied to the
pollster maybe Reagan was I recall under
a lot of you know criticism from the
mainstream
media but uh yeah so then we had uh then
George Bush Senior was the head of the
CIA under Reagan and then oh surprised
the head of the CIA gets elected as the
next president oh how about that and
then the only reason Clinton won is
because he had that weird Ross bro
situation that suck suck some votes off
otherwise would have gone the other way
and then you get uh Bush who
suspiciously wins over uh over Gore
again it's a little bit suspicious but
the son of the CIA head wins
and then he starts up some big
Wars I
mean it's kind of hard to ignore right
and then Biden
wins and the next thing you know we're
funding
Wars do you see any correlation
there it looks like it looks like
whoever is running our whoever is
running our elections
hypothetically is just making sure that
the person who's going to spend the most
on the military wins and it doesn't
matter what
you know about them that's probably the
whole
decision that's what it feels like I
don't have proof of that apparently
there's going to be heavy rain in some
of the Swing states that might stop
things but uh I have a
hypothesis that the rain will stop
Democrats more than it will stop
Republicans what do you think maybe
probably the Democrats say the same
thing but in Reverse I I say no
Republican stops because of
rain that's what I say like none
zero Democrats I don't know maybe maybe
women like rain often so I don't think
it'll going to necessarily stop anybody
we'll see th this might be the kind of
election where the weather doesn't stop
anybody because everybody's so
incentivized well the most fun TV
watching will be MSNBC uh watched some
clips this morning and oh my God are
they crazy uh you Rachel matow talking
about putting musk on a business if
Harris wins is so dangerous crazy and
and let me be honest I don't say this
just uh to be a
partisan Rachel madow looks to have a
major mental illness and I don't think
she should be talking on television
whatever that is that she has that needs
to be just treated with some kind of
compassion but she should not be talking
in public and Joy Reed is the same
situation like I feel like she so
obviously has a mental illness and it's
not being made better by her job that
that there's something terribly evil
going on there now there's some of the
people on the
show that don't look crazy it looks like
they just you know bought into some evil
with their employers you know Chris
Hayes he doesn't look crazy he doesn't
look like he has mental illness so there
they have plenty of people who have
opinions I don't like who don't look
like they have a mental illness but some
of their biggest names just seem so
obviously mentally
ill how do you not see it you all see it
right yeah Morning
Joe
ma Rachel
madow Joy
Reed are you telling me that you think
they're they're mentally okay
and like I said there are whole bunch of
other hosts who I don't agree with one
bit I don't think they're
crazy but
wow um Vance in his closing argument
said uh something like you know uh
Republicans aren't G garbage but we're
going to take out the trash so then the
MSNBC people groaned oh that's too far
can you believe can you believe that
he's referring to kamla Harris as trash
to which I say she's been calling Trump
Hiller for years and the supporters
white supremacist for
years no calling kamla Harris trash is
just sort of ordinary political talk if
if Vance had said that all of her
supporters are trash I would have a
problem with Vance as well because
that's not cool I happen to know some
people that are quite fine people so to
speak
who who might vote the other way but
calling a politician trash when that
politician is called you Hiller no
that's
fair that's totally fair but to watch
the MSNBC people groan like oh he's gone
too far it's just like weird mental
illness theater I just can't stop
watching it it's like a car accident so
tonight uh I'll I'll be doing some live
streaming tonight uh later in the
evening and I will definitely be
checking in on
MSNBC because watching their reactions
is just fascinating like I that place I
I can't believe it
exists then CNN was uh Jake Tapper was
trying to make RFK Jr look dumb by
because RFK JR says he wants him to
remove fluoride from water so who did
Jake have on somebody who wanted say
that fluoride's perfectly safe do you
think it was somebody who maybe gets
paid for that opinion I don't know
probably I'll tell you what I'm not
going to believe is CNN talking to
somebody about my
health never again I'm never going to
believe some reporters who are not
scientists talking to some managers some
managers not scientists some managers
about how everything's safe
come on that you know and by the way I
don't know about fluoride that I have a
curiosity about it in
which kind of
curious I wonder but uh I don't
necessarily think there's something
wrong with it I also don't think there's
any chance that RFK Jr would ban
fluoride from all water without a very
very detailed scientific look and and a
public conversation about it right he's
not you know he says he's going to do it
on day one but there would be a
conversation well if that's not good
enough for you um while you're
distracted according to the
independent uh chienti Chinese
scientists have claimed a breakthrough
in designing a real life Death Star
energy
weapon
so China has a Death Star
uh apparently the death star weapon is
focuses multiple microwave beams on a
single Target so they can take out
missiles and they can take out GPS
satellites and uh I guess it's not yet
on a satellite but in theory you could
put it on one so it could just go up
there and start shooting down everything
so maybe who gets elected doesn't matter
because the Death Star is
coming there's a story in the New York
Post about the FBI thwarted some guy's
planned attack on a Nashville power grid
he was going to use a drone so just some
crazy extremist guy and uh so he
apparently had a drone and he had a
explosive device and he had a plan and
um they stopped
him
so what did they say they they say he's
a white supremacist he has white
supremacist ideology but yeah I read the
entire story about him and I saw nothing
about
that so was he white supremacist or is
it just the day before the election and
there has to be a white supremacist
somewhere because otherwise it means
that Biden has been warning us about
white supremacist for four years and
they don't exist but isn't that
convenient wow right before election day
there it is a violent white supremacist
that uh I can't see any evidence of him
being a white supremacist
now obviously he's not a good guy
but so yeah that's right on right on
point did you hear the story Fox News is
reporting about um apparently KL Harris
did an interview with a
Muslim um influencer an american guy so
he's a Muslim guy who interviewed her
and I guess they had a deal that if he
didn't like how it went he wouldn't
release it and he didn't like how it
went so he didn't release it one of the
things was she was not all the
interviewer was not allowed to ask her
about um I think it was
Gaza you know what the most important
question uh so so and he didn't he
didn't ask about
Gaza but uh apparently they had guided
him to talk about the question of people
taking their shoes off on flights
because then she would do a funny story
about taking their shoes off on
flights and then we would all relate to
it and love
her and so and she wouldn't even do that
apparently she started talking about
seasonings and while she's talking to
the Muslim guy I'm not making this up
she started into a rant about how bacon
is a great
seasoner now the
Muslims um they're not all bacon
eaters I don't know what percentage of
Muslims ofo
uh ham products um but you don't want to
be singing the Praises of
bacon on something that's branded as a
Muslim
podcast and then it got
worse she started talking about
pizza and her favorite pizza
topping guess what it
was it wasn't pineapple
it was
yeah
so it was
pepperoni it was
pepperoni so she she went she went on a
Muslim interview and talked
about her love of bacon and
pepperoni when she was supposed to talk
about taking your shoes off on the
flight and he couldn't even guide her to
talk about that and and she wasn't
allowed to talk about politics while
she's running for
president and it's a tie according to
the polls it's a
tie all right
great well there's a uh some scientists
in Johannes Gutenberg University Mains
they have some kind of cobalt copper
tandem thing that converts carbon
dioxide to
ethanol so now you can apparently suck
the CO2 right out of the air and turn it
into fuel or ethanol at least and uh
that would be the end of the
world because if you had a device that
could crave something you could sell
for more than the cost of making it and
all I had to do is just sit there in
your garage and just chug
along oh looks like you got another
gallon of ethanol to sell
um you're not going to be able to stop
people from doing
it even even if too much CO2 got taken
out of the air so like all the Farms
started dying you still wouldn't be able
to stop people from doing it because
they could just have that little device
cranking along somewhere where you don't
see it just sucking more CO2 out of the
air now I don't
think it's likely will suck enough out
of the air that it hurts the plants but
I know you wanted me to say that because
you you wanted to say it you wanted to
say the plants will die it's plant food
so I said it for
you all right ladies and
gentlemen today will be one of the most
important days in American
history um I do Buy in fully to the idea
that the founders have returned it feels
like almost
reincarnation it could
be that what's going on is that there's
a certain spirit that has to that has to
return in order to fix
things uh and it could be that that
Spirit which happened once in
1776 it feels like it's
back not the same people but you can
almost map the characters in in of the
founders you can almost map them to a
lot of the people who are in the public
now I don't think it's a coincidence
that Elon mus RFK Jr tulsey uh
Amman
me uh
noval noval just joined the team are you
kidding
me so I feel very strongly that the the
corrective
Spirit you could call it
God uh you could call it the simulation
you could call it
karma you could call it
justice you could call
it right or
wrong but it sure feels like it's
coming now I don't want to be
too um too
optimistic you know CU it's an
unpredictable world but I don't
feel like it can go any direction except
the way we want
and I do think that it's possible that
Harris will be declared
President I do think that the cheat
might be found as
well and that could reverse it before
anybody gets sworn in so I do think that
we could get a TW fur or a one for the
one for is that you know Trump wins and
goes on and the Golden Age happens the
twofer would be that Trump ultimately
wins
but we find out that our system was
broken and then we can figure out how to
fix it that would be the big win so I'm
as interested in catching the cheats if
they
exist because I haven't seen any that
are proven to me that are big enough
that would change an election but if
they
exist I want to find
them and I think that uh that the Lara
Trump Michael Watley RNC people I feel
like they're the right people I feel
like the right people are in the right
places and they've put the right people
in the right places and man are there
going to be a lot of complaints so I
don't think that we're going to get a
result
tonight unless the secret Trump vote is
way bigger than I thought I was talking
to my smartest Democrat friend the other
day and he says that there will not be
and he knows a lot about polling he's a
polling expert as as well um he says
that this time there will not be a
secret Trump supporter because they've
corrected for that so somehow they've
corrected for the secret Trump
supporter to which I
say
really how'd you do
that because I had to tell them that
I've been training Republicans to lied
to holsters for nine years so so good
luck good luck luck I think the I think
Republicans know exactly what to do and
and they know how to do it and they know
it
matters so I think that they're not shy
Trump
supporters I think they're Trump
pranksters that's what I think I think
they're Trump pranksters meaning that
they do support Trump but the prank is
not letting anybody know until it's too
late to do anything about it now that's
a prank
now when you tell me that it's men who
are supporting Trump the
most prank we love our pranks it's just
built into being a guy we love
pranks so yes getting making sure the
pollsters are embarrassed on Election
Day would be the best fun and every man
knows that we all know that that would
be just the most fun to embarrass the
pollsters on Election Day so I think
that maybe the shy Trump
supporter might be a thing of the past
but the Trump
prankster well that might be the
future so we'll see you again tonight uh
you've got a lot of TV watching to do
today as do I it's all happening today
and uh we'll we'll check in again when
some of the votes are counted tonight
thanks for uh joining I'm going to talk
to the locals people privately for just
a minute uh but the rest of you I'll see
tonight and maybe tomorrow thanks for
joining
