you do
[Music]
good morning everybody
and welcome to the most canceled content
in all of America and I know you're here
for some of that we'll talk about the
news first and then we'll get to more
outrages do you think I could say
something that's even more problem
making and provocative than what I've
already done
I probably can I probably can I've got
one uh I've got one in the chamber
so you want to wait around for that one
just wait for the one that's in the
chamber okay
so
um if you'd like your experience to be
maximized and I know well let me look at
you yes yes you're that kind of person
you are the kind of person who does not
settle for a below par live stream like
you see so often other places no you
want a good experience a maximum
experience and for that
all you need is a company or a glass of
tanker telephone Joker plastic vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and today it comes
turbocharged with two white boards
two
go
all right well some people told me this
week there there are many opinions about
me and some people said to me Scott
you just did the dumbest thing you could
ever do
not talk like that in public you cannot
say those things in public
now
I thought for a while
that might be the dumbest thing anybody
said in public
and then I saw
I don't know if this is fake news
and I I'm sorry I'm just gonna have some
fun with this so no no bad feelings
but can somebody tell me if this really
happened
did Tim Poole go on Fox News and say
that the woke agenda ended his sex life
did that actually happen
can somebody confirm that that's a real
story because I looked at it I can't
tell
it's fake right is it fake
does anybody know
is is this not perfect it's perfect
because you can't tell
let's go private here
yeah I have no idea
I have no idea if that's real I saw
there was some uh little hashtag
now if he's at it I'm sure there's some
context there that you know ties it all
together but I love the fact that that
got taken probably out of context I
assume it's out of context but
I don't know I just love that story I'm
not making fun of Tim Poole I just love
the fact that he's that allegedly and I
don't know if it's real let me be very
clear I don't know that that's real
but it was trending today I'd love to if
somebody knows tell me tell me if that
really happened
but I love that I can't tell the
difference
that's what's fun about it because I I
don't know I don't know that might be
real but it might not be it's I'm going
to say that's a 50 50.
yeah and by the way I I liked him I
recommend his show by the way these show
is very good
all right well I was looking for you to
confirm her tonight but I don't think
you know as new know either all right
um I'm going to suggest based on
anecdotal vibes
and this idea comes not directly from me
but it feels right
but somebody who's real tapped into the
Republican world is telling me this and
I want to see if you're getting the same
feel if any of you are Republicans
so this is sort of a question for
republicans
the biggest issue
by far
for Republican window women
you say it's not private let me check
there we go
what's your limited yeah it's weird that
that doesn't work the first try I have
to do it twice
thank you but uh
at least one smart person is reading the
room and saying that the most important
issue by far
at a at a human level when you're
talking to real people not when you're
on Twitter but when you're talking to
real people what do you think the
biggest issue is just by far
that just throw it out there what for
Republicans what's the main thing
I want to see if you're all on the same
page okay your answers are all over the
place from economy to inflation now
certainly all those things are important
but anecdotally
and I'd love to see a poll on this but
anecdotally the moms are protecting
their children
and that's that's the primary energy at
the at the individual level
that might be the primary energy
because that's what people ask about
right if you say hey let's go talk to a
bunch of Republicans you see what comes
out of their mouths
is not necessarily inflation even though
it's a huge issue right even fentanyl
all these issues if you just ask them to
say what's on your mind
it's not going to be fentanyl you know
unless they had a direct experience as I
did but I think it's the children
and I don't know how you could program
against that
so if if Republicans ran on Save the
kids
who beats that
who beats save the kids
when people are primed to understand
that that's the real problem because
save the kids handles a whole bunch of
stuff it handles Fentanyl
right Sentinel is part of save the kids
you know there's some of them are older
kids but they're still somebody's
children
and it it goes to uh fixing schools
and fixing schools would fix what
systemic racism it would be the the
biggest lever you could push to fix
racism So when you say save the kids if
you do it in any kind of sensible way
there are a whole bunch of topics that
get fixed at the same time
have you heard Professor Scott Galloway
talking about The Lost Generation of
young men
the current situation with dating is you
know women are going for the top 10
percent of men and the rest are you know
left to I guess porn and masturbation
and you know empty lives
but as Scott Galloway correctly points
out a lot of that is because the young
men are not growing up to be worthy
partners
they're just not developed
in a way that some woman's going to want
to say give me some of that
and I think there's something to that
stop the whole story but there's a lot
to that so this this whole uh this whole
save the children
just bubbles up into almost everything
how would you save the economy
well you got your short run stuff
which probably we do roughly correctly
but your long run is just education
am I right we'll adjust the kids in the
long run your your economy is dead
unless you educate kids better and get
rid of the Fentanyl
so it's basically you have to solve the
kid problems to solve the economy so
save the kids ends up being a
really save us all
you know save the kids I'm sure that the
left would say what about
what about the climate
and that's easy
we love the climate
but we don't want to do something that
makes things worse
you know so it's easy to counter any
argument against it I don't know but put
that into your thinking cap and maybe
just do a little observing
about what people bring up unprompted
because it's the bringing it up
unprompted
that makes it kind of stand out
education does not mean what you think
it does well I like uh
there's a good point uh I like to
broaden education to mean any kind of
training anything that's useful for your
life
especially your financial life but also
anything that's useful for your sanity
and happiness as well that should all be
education
all right let's talk about Doug imhoff
the so-called
uh
second gentleman
he's not even the first gentleman
he's the second gentleman
I don't know how you you rank uh adult
men
in 2023 but apparently if you had been
married to a female president you'd be
the first gentleman
if you're married to a vice president
who's female you're the second gentleman
and if the vice president that you're
married to owns a pet you're something
like the third creature
you know because the Pet's going to be a
little higher than you let's face it
so you got to get that right
well Doug MLF the the second gentleman
is in the news by saying there's too
much toxic masculinity
and uh
apparently he is selling himself as
someone who
not selling this that's
selling is just a jerk word like I hate
myself for saying that
withdraw withdraw he's simply stating
he's not selling anything he's just
stating that he thinks there's too much
toxic masculinity
but apparently he has escaped the curse
of toxic masculinity is pretty happy
about it
and a lot of people wanted to argue with
him about you know masculinity and blah
blah blah here's my take
why are we arguing about that that's
arguing over a word
why are we arguing over a word
like or two words toxic masculinity
how about how about a high ground move
I've told you that The High Ground
maneuver is what you say that ends all
arguments
all right watch me end the debate
how about everybody can just be
different
that's the end of the debate
That's The High Ground maneuver if you
come into a conversation where people
are like me me me toxic masculinity no
you don't have toxic masculinity no I
think I think Kamala is your boss oh you
should not be saying that oh we need
more toxic masculinity yes we need less
toxic myself
and then you come in and say well how
about we just treat everybody as an
individual
any problem anybody anybody raise your
hand anybody have a problem with just
treating everybody as a
individual for once anybody that's
that's the end so that's an example of
The High Ground maneuver
once you learn to do High Ground
maneuvers
you win every conversation
you'll win them all because you just say
the thing that nobody disagrees with
that's sort of a higher level thought it
just ends it
uh you may you may be noticing that I'm
doing something along those lines
so far
not completing the task
but keep watching keep watching
all right
um speaking of Kamala Harris
I would like to add a hypothesis to the
mix but I asked this question on social
media now this is just a Twitter poll so
don't put too much scientific faith in
it because there's none Twitter polls
are just people who answer the polls
that's about it
so the Twitter poll I asked this
question if an acquaintance tells you
they belong to a wine club
what do you assume are the odds that
person is a functional alcoholic
and you can answer that question too if
you know if you have an acquaintance
who's a member of a wine club
what are the odds that person is a
functional alcoholic and by that I mean
you know they have wine for dinner but
you know every night and you know they
have wine on weekends and
wine for lunch fairly frequently but
they're functional they have jobs and
everything else
so I'm saying estimates from 10 to 90
percent I would go closer to 90 percent
my observation
and it took me years to find this
pattern
is that the people who are functional
alcoholics
build a lifestyle around that so that
there's a reason to be drinking every
day that doesn't look like the reason is
you're a functional alcoholic
you've seen that oh you've seen it yeah
they're the people who like to entertain
do you know any people who like to
entertain
usually functional alcoholics who are
covering their track
now there are so many functional
alcoholics I don't have a complaint
about it frankly like as long as they're
not driving
it's okay with me I mean it's her life
so I'm not judging I'm just saying it's
one of those patterns that if you've not
noticed it yet
keep an eye on it keep an eye on that
pattern people will build a lifestyle to
cover up you know whatever they're
trying to cover up
if you had a foot fetish is there a
greater chance that you would work
in a large department store woman's
Footwear Place probably because that
would be a you know great place to cover
up your you're a fetish
so
I only ask this because a friend of mine
who knows a great deal about addicts and
alcoholics
I won't say an expert
but pretty close to an expert on this uh
on this topic
says that the reason that Kamala does
that embarrassing cackling when she's
speaking not her normal cackle so if you
notice there's two kinds of cackles
there's the the everyday nervous cackle
that she uses all the time
but there have been a few times when
her happiness about ordinary things
seems unusual
like her love for the fact that you
could charge your phone on a school bus
like that didn't look like normal cackle
that looked like alcohol
now I'm not this is not my opinion
because I didn't have this observation
but somebody who knows a lot about this
world said oh yeah those speeches where
she's she's talking like that and she's
too happy about things that you
shouldn't be happy about that's
obviously drunk
now once you said it you know once I'd
heard it because I hadn't really that
wasn't really high up on my list of
possible explanations for what we're
seeing but once you hear it I said to
myself hey I wonder if anybody thinks
that Kamala is an alcoholic or or even
just drinks more than she should for her
job during the daytime I suppose you
know if you're a vice president you
probably shouldn't drink ever should you
because isn't there a greater than zero
chance that you'll be running running
the country in an emergency within an
hour
right
like would you ever want Hillary Clinton
in an office knowing that she likes her
wine
yeah no matter how much she has
I don't want a semi-inubriated president
sitting there
like that was one thing that I really
think was underappreciated about Trump
you could wake Trump up
any part of the 24 hours and he would
pop up and he'd still be Trump
all day long like I don't think he's
ever anything else he's just he's just
always happened 24 hours
love them or hate him he was ready to go
who is ready to go and sometimes that
might be more important than you know
your specific preferences
um anyway that's I think that was a
great underrated element of trump that
he didn't drink
and drink and by the way you're all
noticing that the trend to stop drinking
at least on Twitter looks huge are you
all noticing that the number of people
who were bragging about no longer
drinking not alcoholics some of them are
but mostly just ordinary people who
found out the alcohol is bad for you
you know I haven't had alcohol for years
so
that's a really good trend
you know I hope you're not switching out
to fentanyl that would be bad
all right um so here's tying this all
together once it was suggested to me and
then I got primed you know once your
brain gets primed it's all you can see
so confirmation bias started to kick in
and I said to myself I think I'll look
online and see if anybody has noted that
Kamala Harris
drinks too much in their opinion or any
rumors about too much alcohol or
anything like that and I didn't see
anything like that
so just to be clear I didn't see anybody
speculating I didn't see any reports of
her drinking too much the only thing
that came up is that she belongs to a
wine club
next topic
uh Rasmussen
um asked people about the age of the
presidents and what age is too much
and uh fit well let's let's see how well
you're doing this
they asked people uh
how many people think 86 years old is
too old to be president
does anyone want to guess I'll ask you
it this way how many people think uh
it's okay
to be 86 years old and pre-president
you're roughly what do you think
yes you're good
how do you do this
are you all mind readers how do you all
know the right answer without even
without being told
you're so close it's 27 20 of 27 of
those asked said that yeah 86 is not too
old to be president what are you talking
about
86 is just getting started
say one quarter of the respondents
yeah
have if anybody is new to me
I think there's probably more new people
here than usual if you're new to my live
streams I've noted that 25 of the public
about
will get every question wrong
every poll question you can depend on 25
to have the most ridiculous opinion just
completely batshit crazy
on any question now the thing is I don't
think it's the same 25 percent
I I think it it depends on the question
which is the funny part I don't think
it's just the same 25 dumb people it
doesn't feel like it
but maybe it is who knows
uh well the most important thing uh well
the second most important thing the most
important thing is did Tim Poole really
say that
that's the most important question of
the day but the second most the question
of the day is what the hell is up with
me
and why am I still talking to people and
why am I not fully canceled and what's
going on anyway
so let's talk about that
if you don't think I can offend you more
than I have
well I take that challenge
challenge accepted the see how offended
you can get
um
uh I will make the following claim
that no one who knows the context of my
inflammatory comments
from last week you all know what I'm
talking about I don't have to summarize
by any but here's my summary no one who
knows the context and is also a normal
person
is angry at me either black or white
nobody who is a normal person and I'm
going to Define normal by excluding the
people who are not normal in a moment
100 of the normal people
the non-professionals just normal people
black and white
agree with me once they hear the full
context
that's my experience right so far I have
only agreement of people who understand
the context now there are a lot of
people who don't understand the context
and they quite reasonably don't agree
with me which should be no surprise
but the ones who don't agree with me
fall into the following categories
peacock's race Drifters social signalers
dopamine gooners and my personal
political enemies
and then people who were fooled by the
fake news
it's not fake news because the quote is
exactly accurate what's fake is that
when you take out the context it
completely changes what was going on
from horrible from helpful to horrible
and if you didn't know that
well you know it's really not your fault
because the fake news was not feeding
you in a useful context of course
so I'd have to say that there's
something positive happening and here's
another positive thing happening
um
I believe that now
the conversation has already expanded in
a useful way here's what I mean
the things that I said are the things
that I'm being told by a lot of people
privately yeah we all think that they
may not be exactly agreed with what I
said but some version of uh yes you know
you're speaking the truth we're all
thinking it and I'm not sure everybody
is interpreting what I said quite the
way they're quite accurately but there
still is like this massive agreement
this this is a conversation
that is helpful
there's a helpful conversation now
because anybody who even brings up this
topic will be fully canceled as I
believe I proved you will be fully
canceled for this topic but do you
realize what I've created
I've created a situation where people
who can't say what I said can go on
television and say
well Scott Adams said what do you think
about that
do you see what happened
it's now allowable conversation because
you can attribute it to me
I did that
I did that for you
you can now say this isn't my opinion
but I'd like to hear your feedback Scott
Adams said
that stupid racist bastard Scott Adams
said that damn freaking bastard who is
more racist than any racist I've ever
known says this what do you think about
that
and now you can have a conversation
now it'll still be awkward a lot of a
lot of work to do
but you now have more free speech you
just have to be a little clever about it
so you don't get canceled like I did
yeah and I'm also sensing that there's a
growing willingness
to talk freely
because when somebody goes first this is
the whole point of you know why the
general should be in the front line
sometimes I don't think that's always a
good idea but you know your leaders
should lead from the front sort of thing
now I wasn't trying to lead anybody
like I was trying to deepen the
conversation I was trying to provoke of
course I was trying to provoke anybody
who thought that was like a literal
serious statement should examine their
reading comprehension
but of course I was trying to provoke I
was trying to get people angry
mission accomplished I didn't feel I was
that persuasive but apparently once the
fake media got involved
um and like I said among the people who
were mad at me are my political enemies
I believe it's fair to say that a
hundred percent of the political right
including people and you know news
related organizations
did not think I should be canceled
what's that tell you is this about race
is it about race if only Democrats want
to cancel big
you don't think there are any people in
the Republican party at all
who know what racism looks like
including the black Republicans you
think they don't know what it looks like
or how to deal with it you know
productively no it it started out as me
being provocative but once it gained
steam it just became political
it's just that they can hide that
just just the way a alcoholic can hide
their alcoholism by forming a wine club
the Press can can get rid of their
biggest political enemy and by the way I
believe that's true
because most of you have watched me
twist The Narrative like almost nobody
can except Trump trump can Trump can
just have his way with the narrative
like that that's why I've been talking
about him because he has those skills
but there are very few people in the
talking out loud political world who can
reframe something as effectively as I
can which is why my book that was just
uh canceled my new book is all about
reframing things
so what I'm doing now is an example of
what's in the book but in the book it
would be more reframing for your own
purposes I'm reframing for public
purpose which is really dangerous
if you haven't noticed it's really
dangerous
don't do it yeah you know I don't mind
doing it because here's another thing
I've been teaching you for years you've
heard me say this a lot of times
if you want to succeed
at anything anything
here's the formula for Success this is
that most summarized formula for success
if there's something you want to succeed
at
find out the price
and then pay it
this is the best advice you'll ever have
so I wanted to talk about this this
topic
so I thought what's the price of that
well the price of that is the risk of
full cancellation
and then I paid it
have you heard me complain yet
nope
nope I looked at the menu I looked at
the price and then I ordered that meal
right in front of you
I just paid the price that's all that
happened
now I wasn't expecting it would be this
high
but that was on the menu like it was
obvious that it could be it was quite
obvious that that was a you know pretty
high possibility I didn't know
but certainly I paid that price now am I
sad that I paid that price I haven't
experienced that yet
I have not experienced any feeling of
regret which might surprise you
because this is something that you don't
go around
once you've paid the price
I just bought a ticket
to drive right through the middle of it
I'm going to bore a hole
through the narrative because I paid the
price I bought the ticket the rest of
you can watch
I don't recommend participating
but just watch
all right um
so I believe there's already a public
benefit that is a benefit and would you
agree with this statement it would be a
benefit to black white American you know
Asian Americans Hispanic name your
category
anytime you can broaden the conversation
on the most important topic in my
opinion this is the most important topic
in the country right now
um you're probably
improving your odds of a good outcome
all right I'm laughing at your comment
but I'm not going to say it
um all right here's a here's another
thing
so Andy know
um
is publishing a video and apparently the
City of Springfield Ohio
and the the context for this is all
these videos of violence you know
individual violence
is creating a narrative in our heads
that is super super dangerous
because visual persuasion is the most
important and if you see three or four
anecdotes about anything
you don't even care about the data
right would you agree that if you see
some visual anecdotes of some horror
you'll never care about the data
like so it's the same problem that white
people have said about the black lives
matter probably the biggest issue about
police brutality
if their videos of police brutality you
think it's happening everywhere because
visual persuasion is so strong
but was there actually a massive problem
of of the police
targeting black
people in particular
for violence
I don't know how big that was but our
impression of it is Big because we saw
videos of it and we just kept seeing it
you know the George Floyd stuff if you
just watch that a million times like
most of us did it looks like you know
he's one of thousands of people or
whatever
but so visual persuasion is very racist
and misleading and at the moment there's
this uh whole bunch of uh racist videos
of only black people beating up white
people and Asian Americans
now what is anybody going to think
forget about the data
forget about the data what is everybody
going to think if they're news sources
on their social media are feeding them
this constant stream of things that
would make them uh
unless a reflexive persuaded way not a
thinking way but sort of a reflexive way
to cause people to have a bad feeling
about Black Americans
terribly unfair
and
what makes it worse is obviously the
social media algorithms because
the thing that's really bothering me
is that if we didn't have obviously
racist social media algorithms
that are I think clearly suppressing all
the Asian American and white kids
beating up black people
that just makes the it makes the problem
appear one-sided
so I think we have to go all the way
down to the social media algorithm level
to and maybe Elon Musk can fix that and
Zuckerberg could look into it and fix
that so that we're served up at least an
equal amount
of white kids beating up black kids and
Asian Americans like targeting black
Americans on the street and stuff
because if we've got something that was
more like balanced
then it's not going to look all racist
what do you mean that doesn't exist
no it must exist
because we wouldn't be talking about it
this way if it didn't exist
obviously is this
obviously it exists so all of you
racists who are just tweeting around
these violent things of black people
beating up other people
just know that you're working with the
racist
algorithm and between the racist
algorithm and you you're not making
anything better
so just be aware of that Larry Elder uh
did a video in which here's the first
part of the video so you'll get the
sense of it he said quote rather than
thank Adams for saying out loud what
clearly a lot of people feel including a
lot of black people so we could have you
know a healthy discussion about this
Adams is being hounded shut down and
canceled
now
Larry Elder
I endorsed for governor of California
and by the way I think he would have
been great
that when when people tell the story of
me
do they tell the story about how I
supported Obama for president
and I think he did okay
you know nobody's perfect so I'd have
things to criticize but I thought he was
a solid president I backed yay before I
realized what his mental state was
exactly but I thought you know wouldn't
that be fun to have a president yay
I've backed Larry Elder
for governor
because I thought he was the best one
running that's it I just thought he was
the best one running
I've backed uh I am backing Vivek
ramaswamy
who I think is Indian American I think
and
do you think that context was ever
mentioned by the Press
how many of the stories you read about
me you said that I'd helped black lives
matter try to organize their messaging
how many how many reported that I re
that I supported strongly supported
against the will of much of my audience
it cost me money
um
reform uh prison reform
right that was not so popular among
Republicans so I lost audience
supporting that
and knew it did it anyway
uh how many
how many know that I uh once blogged
in favor of reparations
not the way it's being described now
where it's just a cash payment but some
kind of a grand let's say agreement
among black Americans and everybody else
to do something that would maybe mostly
help black Americans but it would help
everybody poor and then you've got
something then you've got something
everybody can say all right all right I
see how this mostly affects black
Americans but that's because they were
in the biggest hole
so that's fine
you know as long as we're talking about
income it's okay if it's racist because
it would be racist wouldn't it
if you if you did something that helped
all poor people
but the nature of it is that uh Black
Americans were in a deeper hole
so it would it would help them more than
it would help other people
that would be racist by definition
now that would be positive racism in my
opinion was that would anybody disagree
that would be a policy which affects
races disproportionately you know you're
doing it
you know you're doing it I'm going to do
this policy it will affect the races
disproportionately
um but it's a good thing to do
are there other cases where there are
things that are purely racist
but they're a good thing to do can you
think of any other examples something
that you would say well you know
technically that's racist
but it's pretty good thing to do
all right here's one
affirmative action
historically
so my take on affirmative action is that
while it was very bad for my personal
career I lost two careers because I was
white and male in my corporate days even
then I was not opposed to affirmative
action I hated how it affected me
but I was not opposed to it because and
the reason I wasn't opposed to it is
that
I couldn't figure out an alternative
you see the problem
when things are really unequal
yeah the tool to fix it is a
sledgehammer
and the sledgehammer breaks stuff more
than you want to break right but it's
the only tool you have like what else
are you gonna do what else are you gonna
do but as things get a little closer to
equal
but before they're completely equal
the right time is to reassess it because
you're going to start to create more ill
will then you're benefiting by you know
correcting some historical imbalances
so
I think that affirmative action was
racist by Design
by intention
and that would anybody disagree with
that is there anybody who thinks that
affirmative action is not racist
by intention by Design
in fact if it were not racist it
wouldn't work the entire point of it is
to be racially racial preference is the
entire point of it
right so I would contend that there are
racist things
which are the ones you want because it's
how you defeat
um racism let's say the tax code
let's say the tax code was super
favoring one group over another
which is always the case even if you
don't want it to it just feels like no
matter how you create anything it always
has a disproportionate impact on
somebody right
so suppose you correct and suppose you
correct a disproportionate problem with
some group how can you correct that
without shifting resources back and
forth
or favoritism to another racial group
now it might be a very good thing to do
but it's going to be racist
because it's treating the groups
differently and then having the policy
that represents your different treatment
of the groups now if your point is to
help a group that needs a hand up that's
a good conversation to have
and I'm always open to that
all right this is this point is going to
get deeper
um Kevin Costa who I'm taking as
probably a black man on Twitter just
based on the profile and the
conversation
he said about me and my statement quote
he was clearly being openly and
purposely racist
would you say that's true was I being my
provocative comments were they clearly
and openly and purposely racist
yeah I said they were
I said that
so he's arguing with me by agreeing with
me I'm saying yes yes
right right Holger
it was totally racist and it was meant
to be that way would you like to hear
the context
now do you think that I was trying to
make things worse for black Americans
how many think I was trying to make
things worse for black Americans
anybody
oh somebody says yes some of you are
saying yes
I wasn't expecting that
all right most of the answers are now
the people who know me the most know the
answer is no if you weren't listening to
the opening context I could see how
you'd say yes all right so people say
yes don't know me as well
um
but people who know me on locals they
they're a little closer to the answer so
here's how I explain this
about
being openly racist
and we're going to the whiteboards
here are some things which I would argue
are openly racist
and at the same time you like them
right not everybody I'm saying these
these are the things that are socially
approved
but they're clearly racist
uh ESG CRT
Black History Month affirmative action
Dei College admissions if there's any
preferences in those and reduced free
speech for some people
I think Society generally thinks that
white people should not have the same
level of free speech
and I think a lot of people would agree
with that they'd go oh if those white
people are saying whatever they want
like our narrative will be impacted
now here's the one that I think is
interesting voting for Obama
I voted for Obama
in large part because he was black
did anybody else vote for him because he
was black like it wasn't the only reason
I think he was qualified and I think he
did a good job unlike my audience I
think he did a reasonably good job
yeah and and I I respect your
disagreement on Obama but here's why
here's why I and yeah I see a lot of
people saying yes
a Black America voted for him by
overwhelming numbers right and white
Americans voted more for Obama than I
think John Kerry
and I believe that a lot of us had the
same thing in mind
you know I won't read other minds but I
speculate that a lot of people thought
like I did wouldn't it be good
to finally have a black president so we
don't have to hear any more complaints
about how a black man can't succeed
now obviously there's still plenty of
you know structural systemic racism but
isn't it good for the country that we've
had a black president
would anybody disagree with that like
forget about Obama as a personality just
ask yourself is the United States you
know the the Melting Pot country
better or worse for having had a black
president who was popular by the way
okay now uh
I I I'm pretty sure that was good for
the country
now at the same time
racism went through the roof or or I
should say racial Harmony Drop Like a
Rock during Obama and then continue to
drop so nobody fixed it
so it's possible that something about
the Obama era
made things worse I don't know exactly
what policies
you think it was policies
could be
all right but I would say that voting
for Obama if you were voting for him to
to make sure that we had a black
president finally that's why I did it
plus he was qualified I thought
um I thought that was racist
was that let me ask you was it racist
for me to vote for Obama in large part
because of his color
was that racist
how would that not be racist
somebody says no well okay
yeah you probably have an argument there
if I heard it I'd probably agree with
you well I would say that's racist
I did that
I did this racist thing
I'm guilty
um how about uh Black History Month
is Black History Month good or bad for
black people
some of you say bad let's see you think
I'm going to say it's bad I don't know I
don't know I don't think it's bad
I I feel like Black America
you know went through enough they get a
month
if you have the experience of black
Americans From Slavery to today yeah you
could have a month
like I don't have a problem with that
but it is racist doesn't it
this is a racism I totally agree with
I'm totally in that's fine let's be
let's be as educated as possible about
our true history
now you know you might say hey
you know how about a woman's History
Month well we have that too
we do have a woman's History Month I
don't know how many other history months
there are but aren't they all either
sexist or racist
all those months are sexist and racist
right
they're totally sexist totally racist I
don't disagree with either one of them I
don't have a problem with them
so there's a whole bunch of stuff
uh and like I said affirmative action
at the moment I think we should
reconsider
but historically I favor This Racist
totally racist activity
and uh
yeah and the other ones you might like I
mean you might like ESG and you know by
the way does everybody even know what
ESG is
do I have to Define that
let me explain the SG
ESG is uh let's say environmental social
and governance
and the two things in there are for
corporations are being judged by
entities that judge them including
BlackRock you know this multi-trillion
dollar Financial behemoth
so this huge financial entity BlackRock
is pushing this idea that companies
should be evaluated for their ESG
quality so the the E for environmental
they have to be reducing their carbon
footprint and then the social and
governance is they should have diversity
at all levels up to the top of the
organization
now
the companies that push ESG
um are they happy that I'm one of the
most noted critics of the thing that is
the operating system of their company
right now they have ESG so management of
newspapers do you think they they were
opposed to ESG the management of
newspapers or more importantly the the
in many cases the hedge funds that own
the groups of newspapers because that's
how newspapers tend to be owned by big
Financial entities that own like a chain
yeah
so the people so the people that I've uh
pledged
to attack the ESG people because it's so
harmful for business
it's harmful for everything it's harmful
for society but business in particular
do you think there's any coincidence
that the biggest critic of those things
got canceled by the people who promote
those things
it's not the only reason
but when you see who's who's opposing me
and canceling me you have to ask about
their other motives
the the thing I said you know maybe it
was worth canceling According to some
people but that's not why they did it
that's not why why they did it is to
shut me up
right why they did it is to shut me up
that's why
shut me up in a variety of ways but ESG
would be one of them
you know I I was reminded yesterday
that when Dilbert was first introduced
into newspapers it was very difficult to
get the newspaper to buy it because it
made fun of management
uh and I've forgotten how you know
quaint things were back then
make you don't remember but Dilbert was
a controversial uh it was a
controversial strip it was controversial
because the main managers and leaders
look like idiots and the managers and
leaders were not on board with that idea
because it allowed the staff to mock the
people above them it made it easier for
them just hey look at this comic uh so
the people who canceled me
as anybody stopped to think that the
people who canceled me the management of
the newspapers are the people that I've
been mocking for 34 years like viciously
mocking them do you think they didn't
want a reason to cancel me even if they
thought it was funny they'd probably
like well a little less of that would be
good all right
here's a second
the second
summary
people who don't know the context of my
controversy have asked me to summarize
it and so I'm borrowing this but this is
a
basically it I said some version of you
should avoid people that the society has
primed to be racist against you
some people said wait a minute Scott you
did not add that Nuance the first time
you said it
and then I said yes that's why I
clarified
and then they said clarification is not
allowed
and I said what
and they said no if you meant to clarify
it you would have done that in the first
place
and I said
no the reason that there's a word called
clarification is that there are all
kinds of reasons that you don't say it
in the first place
or sometimes you don't know that
somebody needed that clarification
I actually got two people on on social
media
to argue in public in public while
people were watching they're clarifying
your comments uh is not to be accepted
can you believe that two people like
adult human beings
argue that clarifying is a bad idea
that that that's how you know you've won
an argument you can't win an argument
harder than that yeah clarify clarifying
is a bad idea
what
all right so here's the summary avoid
people who are primed primarily by
things like ESG and the narrative and
CRT and everything else so we should
avoid people who are primed to be racist
against you the media said well that's a
racist thing to say
and then nobody would have cared except
there's an entire industry of
complainers they have different reasons
so you got your race scriptures dopamine
gooners victims of fake News the people
who didn't know the context and my
political enemies
the newspapers they're literally my
political enemies
so uh then the people who heard it from
all of these people
they responded as exactly you'd imagine
so that's what happened so people who
missed the context that's the cliff
notes version there's a much deeper
richer more interesting context but the
wine club with an H
that's funny
all right so
my statement is this
um
I don't require erasmussen poll
to clarify my lived experience
my lived experience
is that the race relations are being
poisoned by the media narrative that
white people are the source of their
problems now I don't argue with the fact
that white people are the source of
problems
I just argue that if that's how you
focus you only make things worse
and that focusing you know on the future
and how to work together and you know
solutions that everybody likes education
being the easiest one because there's
lots of agreement black and black and
conservative at least there's lots of
agreement and more more Democrats in
general
all right so my lived experience is that
black Americans are being poisoned by
The Narrative and while I can't be sure
it's true any reasonable person would
see the poisoning happening because the
poisoning is obvious and on the surface
right that's not an opinion is it would
you say that's an opinion or is that
just an observation that you all say
that the that the media narrative is
anti-white and very clearly at the
moment very anti-white
so my comment is that anti-white is
looking backwards
and that everybody who looks backwards
gets a worse result than everybody who
looks forward
it's on average
so if you keep a backwards looking you
know victimization who caused it whose
problem it is that can be useful in the
short run and I wouldn't I wouldn't
abandon that but if it's your primary
strategy for the future it can't work
they can't work at all
so when Black America figures out
that I'm trying to unlock them
from
effectively a brainwashing situation
which by the way isn't because you're
black like we're all we're all
brainwashed into our own bubble so
there's that's not a racial comment
everybody's being brainwashed into their
own little bubble and it's not their
fault
because no normal even smart person
can get out of a brainwashed bubble it
doesn't work that way you can't really
think your way out of the bubble like
you can't just think Carter I'm out of
the bubble usually it's some external
event that knocks you out of your bubble
right or something maybe you did
mushrooms or something but you don't get
out of your bubble just by reading the
news
that's not going to help
so some people think they can there
might be some exceptions
all right
so here's Here's Where We Are
if you say that what I said was racist I
agree I agreed from the start by the way
I never disagreed but I will say that if
you're ignoring the context that you
can't fix any racist situation without
also appearing to be and maybe actually
being racist meaning that the the we
should probably make a distinction
between
you know racism with the capital are
and little racism
right
doing things to try to correct a worse
racism with something that's also racist
that's like the small R trying to defeat
the Big R
I'm okay with that
I'm okay with a little racism as an
antidote to a lot of racism because
don't you end up with less racism
if you could spend some money to make
some money and make more than you spent
wouldn't you do that
so being accused of a racist is just
part of my expense
is part of what I'm paying but if you're
arguing about the meaning of the word
it's a diversion from the argument
so here are the ways that now and I
think you're all aware
that at least half of the world wants to
really really avoid the actual topic
have you noticed that
that most of the energy is about
avoiding the topic there's almost no
energy on the point I was making all the
energy is going sideways
so here's here's what happens to the
energy
people saying uh
all right a bunch of examples
the diversions first diversion is that
Rasmussen pole you looked at uh it's not
enough people to be a good sample
well uh first of all there's nothing
about my argument that depends on the
poll
I used the poll as a jumping off point
for the conversation
so I don't depend on it but I will say
about the poll that even though it was
just like a hundred some black people
were interviewed and only 60 some
uh had a problem with the phrase
it's okay to be white
now is that enough people now what most
people don't realize is that there was
only an eight percent margin of error
meaning that even if it's off by eight
percent more or less it wouldn't change
the point
it doesn't change the point if you're
off eight percent
yeah well it's not a point about an
exact number it's a point it's a point
about too many people being primed by
the public by the by the media to have a
negative opinion about white people
just too many
now let me ask you this and then other
people said that the question was a
racist some kind of Neo-Nazi question or
something so suppose the question had
been different
my take on the question is it okay to be
white is that a black racist could still
say yes to that
what do you think
I think a black racist could still say
yeah it's okay to be white but you're
all screwing us and you're all doing bad
things
right suppose the question had been
asked this way
um do you believe that white Americans
are the cause of past and continuing
systemic racism
what would have been the percentage of
black Americans who would say white
people are the cause of past and the
primary cause of continuing systemic
racism
because even I think that's true
even I think that's true but the
difference is it doesn't make me think
uh
doesn't make me think less of white
people do you know why
because I don't know any white people
doing that
I don't know any white people who are
plantation owners not a single one
I don't know any white person who's in
any intentional or even accidental way
perpetuating systemic racism
I don't even know one
now they may be doing it by inaction
but you know then it gets a little more
conceptual
but I don't know any white people
like that
anyway
um
let's see other diversions
are
that I'm a racist for pointing out the
correlation and I use the word
correlation and I was quoted back for
saying correlation I'm a racist for
pointing out the correlation between uh
crime and the density of black
population
now what I said was that the causation
is systemic racism
and that got turned into oh you're
saying there's a correlation between
black density and crime therefore you're
a racist
which is the opposite of what I said
I said that systemic racism which I also
believe is primarily formed by and you
know and enhanced by white people
almost by definition
um I think that's the cause that's the
cause of black poverty
it's the main contributor to Black
poverty and then poverty causes the
crime
now there's nobody who disagrees with my
statement that there's a high
correlation the correlation is caused by
history
and the correlation is that poor people
have more crime
who disagrees with that but it's part of
the diversion to avoid the point right
we're gonna we're gonna attack you on
that thing here's another one uh well
the people who oppose clarification that
was funny
and and then the complaint that it's
okay to be white is a racist meme
that just seems to be trying to avoid
the point because like I said the poll
and the question were not important to
my opinion it was my lived experience
and I'm joining that now with all the
people who are
um were sort of chipping in not chipping
and chiming in
so a lot of white people are coming to
me and Whispering some version of
you know I think it is okay to be white
uh it's not a racist thing
and a lot of white people are telling me
privately that they're feeling
increasingly victimized by the narrative
but also the video showing you know the
the crime makes everything worse
uh
somebody says crime is a tribal trait
well no it isn't
crime is a tribal trait
I don't think there's any evidence for
that
uh it seems to me everybody was rich
does less crime than everybody who's
poor
for obvious reasons if you're rich
stealing stuff is all downside no upside
all right it's easy to be honest when
you're rich uh I can tell you that for
sure
all right yeah I think the it's okay to
be white is the is the question that
would get you the least amount of racism
in the answer
am I wrong
the way at Rasmussen asked it is it okay
to be white I think a lot of people who
actually had bad feelings about white
people would still say yeah it's okay to
be white but you're also the cause of
all our problems
I don't want to be around a community of
people who think that I
like right now in my current existence
and the cause of their problems
and I would argue that nobody disagrees
with that
okay El Chapo is an example of a rich
criminal but El Chapo can't change
because he can't really retire when
you're ahead of a cartel
I'm pretty sure retirement means getting
killed yeah you didn't have a choice
um which is why I think you could
actually convert the cartels I think you
could actually convert them to an honest
industry
uh
like if there were any way to do that
because they would want to get out of
the crime business once they're rich if
you're the head of a cartel you had a
billion dollars
isn't the thing you'd want more than
anything
to not be a criminal anymore
like somehow you know launder that into
the legal world so you don't have to
worry
but there's no way to do that be great
if there was
all right
um
then I asked this question on
Twitter so this is another unscientific
Bowl I said does canceling me make race
relations in America better or worse
because that was the point of it right
the point of canceling me is to make
race race relations better
otherwise why do it
what do you think nine percent said it
made it better fifty percent said it
made it worse 40 said no change
well I think most of the world didn't
notice because most of the world doesn't
even read the news they don't even know
any of this happened
yeah too early to tell
it's hard for me to imagine it made it
better
I don't know maybe maybe because it made
this conversation possible and made it
better
I'll give you that
all right let's see if I missed anything
nope
all right you may have noticed that my
social media numbers are way up my
Twitter numbers and my live stream
numbers or through the roof lately
and I think it's because this is a topic
people are interested in
it looks like and I think people are
interested in two reasons
uh
they're interested in two reasons one is
they want to see if I can survive this
is sort of watching it like a movie you
know to see if I can get off a prison or
Island
does it feel like I'm on prison or
Island right now
it's a little metaphor I use
that I always have this belief about
myself and I I recommend this to the
rest of you it's a it's good to have a
story of yourself
if nobody's told you that it's one of
the best self-help things you can ever
have have a story of yourself
my story
I talk about this a lot it's called
prisoner Island
and in my story I'm dropped on an island
let's say I'm falsely accused of a crime
that makes my story better falsely
accused of a crime and they drop me on
an island of only prisoners
on day one
they beat me to near death
day two
they beat me and raped me
day three same as one and two and repeat
but if you come back in a year
everybody who touched me will be dead
and I will be the king of
prisoner Island
that's my story
that no matter how bad it gets
I'm gonna be on top
you just it might take a while
it might not be instant
but it's going to happen
now because I run that story in my mind
when I run into problems as everybody
does I say to myself
I just got dropped on prisoner Island
first week not so good
but wait
just wait
so a lot of you wanted to see the movie
where I was dropped on prisoner Island
here I am prisoner Island
and uh do you think I'll make it off
how many of you think that I can beat
the odds and make it off of prisoner
Island now the cancellation will be
complete but making it off prison and
all it means
coming out better than better than he
left
well we'll see the one thing you can be
sure of is that the you know the
negative feelings about me will remain
forever because people don't look into
context context is not a big thing on
the internet so forever I will have this
you know this over me
but
I don't really care about the
political gooners race Drifters victims
of fake news and my political enemies
and I'm impervious to embarrassment
did you ever wonder yourself Scott
were you marinating in the shame and
embarrassment of this situation
not even for a second honestly it never
occurred to me it never actually
occurred to me that embarrassment or
shame or anything would be part of this
like why I said what I meant
I think is useful
I knew what the price was and then I
paid it I have a very simple model of
the world
it was news in Brazil well I'm doing a
good job then doing a good job
all right so here's
you got fired I did I paid the price
I paid the price
so that you uh
you might be free of sin
now you may have noticed that I timed my
resurrection for uh roughly to happen
around Easter
so anybody notice that
Norm says oh no Scott I am owning it
does that make sense somebody's asking
me to own it how much harder could I own
it
that's my point
Norm my point is that I'm owning it
totally
are you missing that point
did some of this look like an apology or
something
I'm totally owning it I'm owning what I
said I can't own whatever impression
somebody else put in your head like I
don't have any ownership of your own
mental faculties I can't control that
but I could I can own what I did
totally I totally own it
desert Ferry chick says you all realize
this is a way to promote his book right
yes the canceled book you are correct
you are correct it is a way to promote
my book because that book is the
solution
it's the solution
to systemic racism
now I didn't plan that at the at the
front like nobody would nobody would get
their book canceled with the hope that
canceling it makes us all better that
wouldn't be a good economic strategy for
anyone it could work I mean
you know if I had the guest today
I feel like it might be the biggest
selling book of all time
now you haven't seen it so that sounds
crazy to you
but I wrote it
and and I know
generally how this content will be uh
accepted it might be the biggest book
you know not having religious scriptures
and stuff it might be the biggest book
of all time
because that's that's how powerful it is
so reframes are super powerful and
reframes written by hypnotists are going
to be even more powerful because I have
the test as well
so
um here's something that I tell people
all the time if they're trying to
understand me I never do anything for
one reason
I never do anything
for one reason I'm sure there's some
exceptions I shouldn't make that an
absolute but generally speaking in the
business realm or the social realm I do
things for more than one reason
it turns out that after you get canceled
having a book to sell is probably a
pretty good deal
and as it turns out that that book was
exactly on point
with everything that I'm talking about
and what makes it on point is it it
teaches reframes for individuals
so once you get individuals if you train
individuals of any type just individuals
if you train American individuals how to
be more effective
systemic racism will still be there
and be almost unimportant
so if you can't remove the you know all
the stains embedded in our culture of
systemic racism which is nearly
impossible it's such a big job what you
can do as a better strategy is teach
people how to be invulnerable to it
now not by not caring
but by being so successful success
solves everything
do you remember O.J famously said he's
not black he's O.J
because when you're so successful that
you're OJ
systemic racism probably doesn't have
anything to do with anything in your
life now we're not all as successful as
OJ
or as unsuccessful as it turned down
well I guess he was successful in his
own way you know in an evil way
but success fixes everything
again I'm exaggerating that's hyperbole
right you should be used to my hyperbole
by now anytime I speak in absolutes your
little program should say well he
doesn't mean everybody
because I you know almost never do
almost never meet everybody even when I
say the group
so uh my
my experience in life coming from a uh
not rich place
is that having the right strategy seems
to have made all the difference
to me it seems to have made all the
difference I remember I I lost two jobs
to direct racism direct racism or they
told me you won't be promoted because
you're white and you're male
so
um my my tools of success for building a
talent stack that's one of the things I
teach and using having good systems
versus goals and then here's a big one
that I think matters maybe to Black
America
um and maybe maybe low-income people in
general
um
you've heard the saying you you're the
average of The Five People You spend the
most time with
have you heard that now I know Tim
Ferriss says it but it came from
somebody before that I forget who it was
and
there's a lot of Truth to that
if you live in a poor neighborhood your
five closest friends are probably not
doing so well
you know because poverty is associated
with other bad behaviors
uh with other behaviors let's say and
that's a problem
that's the problem so I don't know
exactly how Black America solves that
problem
because I didn't have that problem
but that's a pretty big problem and I
think that's where uh White America just
needs to butt out like at that level I
think Black America just has to figure
that out I don't know what do you do
about that
if if I were the mother let's say I were
a single black mother and I had a kid
who I didn't want to get you know pulled
into crime or bad behaviors and stuff
the first thing I do is find
parents who also had kids who had that
same desire
and then I would form a uh like a play
group pod
so that my son or daughter only spent
time with kids who also wanted to make
it out
and they wanted to figure out all right
what do I have to do to get out of this
place
if if you put them together the people
who are trying to get out
they have a chance
but I think if you take one good person
who wants to get out but they're friends
because of where they live or five gang
members you think that one good person
is going to make it out if they're best
friends or you know four or five gang
members
and that's somebody says yes I did
yeah so I'll speak statistically
you can definitely make it out if you
have bad friends
you could definitely do that but your
odds I think go way down
because of the influence of your peers
so they'll just say it's the odds
call your POD at church oh yeah okay now
there's the benefit of uh black churches
it'll it gets you to associate with
people who are trying to figure out you
know legal useful
well-proven techniques for a good life
that's smart
very smart
uh yeah part of the reason young men are
not getting married is they can't earn
enough yeah there's a constellation of
problems for young men
much of it their own
their own cause
all right
um are black churches racist
yes
are are
but in a good way in a good way I don't
have any problem with the black church
how about uh historically black colleges
so there's still a number of
historically black colleges as far as I
know anybody can go there
could you give me a fact check on that
because it would be illegal to ban
anybody
yeah I think anybody can go there but
they're historically black and they kind
of stay that way now is is having
something that's even called an
historically black college that clearly
is focused on helping black people
associate with other people have the
same goals in life and they can Network
and all that
is that racist
of course it is
but do you disagree with them their
existence I don't I mean some of you
might some of you might you know if
you're if you're like absolutist you
might but you know the world is a messy
place you need to make some exceptions
sometimes you need to boost some groups
for the benefit of everybody and
historically black churches are clearly
racist
in a good way
in a good way just like me
were my comments racist
absolutely
were they useful yep
if you actually take the time to listen
to them you will understand better the
situation
and understanding the situation is the
first step to doing anything useful
so I know a lot of people who got you
know their panties in a bunch so to
speak but I meant that
and there's still some people asking me
to apologize for angering people
I don't apologize for things I did
intentionally
what what good would that do I
intentionally angered people to draw
energy to myself
so that I could talk about anything I
wanted
yeah here we are
although again I didn't think I didn't
think the canceling would get as big as
it was but I knew there'd be some and I
knew it would you know Drive some energy
my way
so there you are
is black music racist
um
well let me ask you this uh there's a
white boy and a black I won't say boy
there's a young white man and a young
black man in a car
and a popular song comes on from a
hip-hop artist
which one can sing all the words out
loud in the car
yes is racist yes yes black music is
purely racist because white people can't
even sing it out loud
you're literally not allowed to sing the
lyrics out loud if you're white
you don't get much more racist than that
now do I have a problem with that
not really
not really
not a big problem is it racist totally
is it okay with me yeah yeah I mean it's
not perfect I don't have a problem with
it
yeah
all right ladies and gentlemen I'm going
to say goodbye to the YouTube friends
who came in to get some outrage I hope I
gave you enough outrage to keep you
going today all of you pandemic gooners

have fun with this one this one's gonna
be this is gonna be good so
