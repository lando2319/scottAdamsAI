[Music]
turn off my ringer
get ready for work are you ready
to learn something useful you know
probably there's nobody who's going to
be on this periscope who doesn't already
understand
what i'm going to teach you because
you're smarter than average
but there might be a few people
wandering in here and it'll be useful to
you
and at the very least you might learn
another way to explain it to other
people
so even if you already know about taxes
and depreciation
you might pick up a little tip so
hang around it's going to be worth it
we'll have some laughs too
but first how do we get going you know
how
it's called the simultaneous sip and all
you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chelsea
stein i can't think jugger flask vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except taxes it's called the
simultaneous step and it happens now
go
ah
i can feel my deductions increasing
well before we get into a little
whiteboard lesson
on taxes that will not hurt what one bit
i'm gonna keep it
so simple that that you won't even mind
listening to it
there's some disturbing news about brad
parscale you've all heard it by now i'm
not really going to talk about it except
to say that we
wish him well this is the sort of story
that should only be viewed as a
medical issue so
that's all that needs to be said there's
a there seems to be a medical issue
and i hope it works out well
am loving just loving
from the trash talking point of view uh
watching the
you know the the president go at her go
after biden and vice versa
i am loving uh president trump
challenging him to a blood test
[Laughter]
now i would say that the odds of that
happening
you were where trump and biden both take
blood tests before the
before the debate i i think it's fair to
say that the odds of that actually
happening are
zero there's no chance it'll happen but
because it's such an outrageous thing to
to bring up
the president can bring it up there's no
risk
because there's no chance it's going to
happen but because he's the president
you sort of have to
cover it in the news because he just
keeps bringing it up and you can't
really ignore
a thing like that so it makes everybody
ask the question
and think about it and focus on that
question of
how are they medicating uh biden
now part of the reason that it's sticky
and it's a it's a good attack
is because even if you support biden
don't you think there might be some
pharmaceuticals involved a little bit
because even if you support him you do
notice the as good days and bad days
you can't miss that what causes a good
day versus a bad day
is it maybe medication is it maybe a
natural cycle which would be
disturbing as well it's a it's a perfect
attack
now of course the counter attack on the
president is
his critics accuse him of uh using
adderall now
do you know anything about adderall
i would say that it should be a rule
that every president
should be on adderall even if they don't
need it
now adderall is a very controlled
substance
because if the wrong person is using it
for the wrong reason
it basically acts like speed and it
could be bad for them
but if somebody
just hypothetically hypothetically if
someone was under a doctor's care
such as a sitting president would you
want them to be on adderall
or to not be on adderall well here's the
thing
if you know anything about it you
probably want them to be on it
because they're going to be way more
productive
and actually smarter that's what it does
i don't want to encourage anybody to
take an illegal
drug if it's not if it's not recommended
by your doctor
but it is a fact that adderall is not
like
cocaine or heroin or you know oxycontin
or anything it's just nothing like any
of those drugs it's not like
alcohol or weed it's not a quaalude it's
not
it's not any of those it is purely a
performance
enhancing drug which has plenty of
you know history and science so if it
turned out
and i don't think that that this is an
evidence
but if it turned out that the president
was on adderall
that would be a plus you're just not
allowed to say that in public
anybody everybody here who's had a
little experience with this
and has had anything in that family of
chemicals
you know what i'm talking about so
uh it's interesting that ignorance
is the the most important part of these
political attacks
is that you can make an attack as long
as the public
doesn't understand the topic so
right now they can say hey he's on this
drug called adderall
and 80 percent of the public will say i
don't know what that is but
it doesn't sound good the way you
described it
and that's it that's all you have to
accomplish is that it doesn't sound good
just like uh you know just like asking
for biden to take a blood test
it doesn't have to happen it just has to
sound
sort of sketchy and damaging and that's
it
so matt walsh tweeted today or yesterday
trump has had financial records linked
to the press
secretly recorded conversations leaked
to the press
and many officials who worked inside the
white house have written tell-all books
and yet through all of that
no crime or actual serious scandal has
been uncovered
did you expect that we would get all the
way to here
and this president would be i mean he's
investigated inside and out
the last thing that people were waiting
for was these taxes
and i can tell you that i i personally
had a conversation with a
uh let's say a notable person who i will
not
describe further a notable very smart
person
who said you just wait when the taxes
come out
someday those taxes are going to come
out and it's going to show all those
terrible crimes
well taxes are out
where's all the terrible crimes
if there were any terrible crimes or
even crimes
you know even little crimes there were
there were in evidence in those taxes
do you think we wouldn't have heard
about it by now
because you don't lead with the boring
stuff
if the new york times had the goods they
had something that was like a
you know even even something suspicious
they would have told you by now don't
you think
so it turns out that the president is
way cleaner than anybody imagined
[Laughter]
i have to admit you know i'm a uh
you know i'm a complete supporter of the
president but even i
was surprised that there's nothing there
i thought you know any billionaire it
wouldn't matter who it is
if you take anybody with a real
complicated billionaire kind of a tax
return
and you say all right here hear you
public go take a look at it
i feel as if you would find something
suspicious looking
in just about anybody's billionaire tax
returns
it might not be crimes and it might you
know if you looked into it it might not
actually be as bad as it looks on the
surface
but there would be all kinds of stuff
there would be flags
where you'd say i better look at this a
little bit
more but apparently trump doesn't have
those
he apparently has a pretty clean return
now the one thing
that is being audited and the president
has been telling us this for years
is that there is a big 72 million dollar
deduction
that's being debated now is that a crime
is it a crime if the irs ultimately says
this will be disallowed not really
i mean there might be a penalty with it
because you know
there may be some requirement for that
but it is completely routine
completely routine for companies to see
some gray area thing
and say well might as well take a shot
it's sort of a gray area
we have an argument the irs would have
an argument the other way we get that
but give it a shot it is not illegal
to give something a shot all right you
have to understand that
that that deduction could be disallowed
but it was done publicly in the sense
that the irs is aware of it
the irs got to look at it and they
started to question it
and apparently apparently there's enough
of an argument
on the trump side that it hasn't been
resolved for years
if it were easy to resolve as if you
know let's say that there was no
argument on the trump side there's just
no argument for this deduction
i feel like it would have been resolved
in less than
four years right it wouldn't take four
years to resolve something
that didn't have an argument on the
other side so even if trump
ends up not winning the you know that
that deduction conversation that's not
illegal
it's completely legal to take your best
shot
if it doesn't work it doesn't work but
you knew what your risk was
here's some of the best tax advice i
ever heard
this came from my smart
democratic friend coincidentally and it
was from a friend of his
and he recall he recounts this story he
said he said he was doing his own taxes
because he's he's really smart
so he can he knew how to do his own
taxes even the complicated
stuff but he reached a point where there
were
two ways to calculate something and it
appeared
that the irs would allow either one
one of those ways he could do it was
good for him
and the other way was not as good for
him but they both looked
like they were allowed it was just two
different ways to account for the same
thing
so he asked his friend who was more of
an expert on finance
he goes what do i do i've got two valid
ways to do this
one is good for me and the other one's
not good for me what should i do
his friend gave him this advice do the
one that's good for you
that's it do the one that's good for you
now what if it turned out that the irs
said
no you know really it should have been
that other calculation
it's fine you might have to pay a little
extra
be you know for the the the interest or
something
for something that shouldn't have been a
deduction but the irs doesn't put you in
jail
for having for having a good argument
that's an important point
that people don't understand it's not
cut and dried
these are legal things these are illegal
things as long as your lawyers can go in
there and say look
this is the reasoning we used here
here's your own rules
your rules say this we read those rules
and we did this how is that wrong
and if the irs says well it is wrong and
here's why
nobody goes to jail for that all right
it's very routine
all right so um
let's talk more about trump's taxes you
should not
trust anybody who who makes
this comparison if you see this on
twitter and you're out you're seeing it
this morning all over the place
people are gonna say this a typical
uh middle-class taxpayer
might pay several thousand dollars
whatever per year
trump only paid in 750.27
so therefore it's totally unfair
right no anybody who gives you that
comparison
and tries to convince you that you've
learned
something because you compared trump's
total taxes to an
average citizen they are lying to you
or they don't know a freaking thing
about
taxes those are the only two
possibilities
anybody who makes that comparison is a
flat out liar
or they don't understand the field
whatsoever there there's no way
that that comparison makes sense it's
comparing a
peanut to an elephant they have
they just are different things and i'll
explain
why all right let me explain for anybody
who
doesn't follow finance doesn't do their
own taxes
a little simple situation i'm not
claiming that this
uh equals trump's taxes it's a generic
situation right
so suppose you've got a company in one
year any
any year that makes two billion dollars
in
money coming in so that's what they've
earned from people
paying them for their services or
products and they've got an expense of a
billion dollars a year
that is actual checks and money that
they've given out
that would leave them since they brought
in 2 billion and
only put out a billion in expenses
that's a billion dollars
left over to spend on stuff
but if they also bought a lot of assets
let's say they bought buildings or
computers or vehicles
you can do a thing called depreciation
depreciation is instead of taking the
cost of that thing
and acting like you you spent all your
money the year that you bought it so
let's say you bought up
you bought a building and it was a
million dollars
you don't write off the whole million as
an expense
the year that you bought it the tax law
says
that you write off a little bit every
year based on
what the tax law says if it's a building
maybe it's
15 years for example and you just spread
it out
as if it's an expense so if you had a
billion of these
paper artificial expenses and a billion
of real ones
the two of them would equal two billion
and that's all the money that you had
coming in
so even though you made a half a billion
dollars in
cash that's yours to keep
you made a half a billion dollars it's
yours to keep you got a half a billion
dollars in cash
on paper you made nothing and you don't
have to pay taxes
federal income taxes if you made nothing
now is that a bad situation is that
unfair is that the rich people taking
advantage
of a tax loophole nope
nope this law about how to
how to deal with depreciation and indeed
uh
depreciation won't be the whole story
with trump's taxes
there will be other loopholes and things
built into the law that he took
advantage of
but everything that's in the tax law
is there because both democrats and
republicans
in all likelihood thought it was a good
idea
that all the smart people thought it was
a good idea
now there are people who argue you
should change the tax to a flat tax
et cetera so there's always room for
debate
but the point is this this idea of how
to treat taxes
even for rich people is not really
controversial
in in the mainstream of people who
understand finance
find me a cpa somebody who is an expert
on taxes
who thinks that this is bad for society
you won't find any there's nobody who
understands this field
who thinks that this is bad or should be
changed
now when i say nobody you can always
find some somebody who will say anything
but the mainstream democrat mainstream
republican
they're all in favor of this there's no
there's nobody on the other side of this
now the other thing you need to know is
that when they say he didn't pay taxes
they're usually talking about federal
income taxes
it doesn't mean that no taxes were paid
indeed
he paid a bunch of salaries and
everybody who earned a salary
paid taxes so instead of the taxes
coming out of here
it went to the people the people had an
income
they paid taxes and that goes to the
federal government
they they also probably paid payroll
taxes and social security and
you know and other related things that
all goes to some government
either local or or federal
what about property taxes every big
company especially if you're a real
estate company have
have enormous property taxes
what about suppliers he's buying stuff
from suppliers
they make a profit they use that once
they get that profit
they pay taxes all right none of this
happens
none of this unless this happens
so why is it that the government and the
irs
thinks it's a good idea to have a
situation where sometimes big companies
pay nothing
it's a good idea because you really
really want this other stuff
you want jobs because if somebody has
this job the government
doesn't have to support them that's a
big win you want
all these taxes this is exactly what you
want
now if this lasted forever
would that be good what if a big company
just never paid taxes they just always
found loopholes and
just never paid taxes would that be good
well it actually would be pretty good
for the reasons i just told you tons of
taxes get paid
but it's a second order effect now
remember
these these suppliers who uh
who made money because they sold stuff
to the company
once they make their money they go spend
it again that's called the multiplier
effect
in economics so these dollars that are
generated by this business
it's not one dollar this dollar goes to
the supplier the supplier buys his own
his own supplies that dollar goes to the
next person
that dollar goes to the next person and
the next person
every time that dollar changed hands
somebody paid taxes
maybe sales tax probably income tax if
there was a
profit there so there's an enormous
economic benefit from a company that
pays no taxes
that's why it's allowed because it's
really really good
for the world it's not a coincidence
that
amazon has this situation it's not a
coincidence that there are lots of
companies
that have this situation here's what you
need to know
for your further lesson in economics
with my awkward whiteboard
here's the situation which might be
somewhat
typical for a company that's not paying
federal income taxes
if you're if you're a growing business
meaning that you're
you're plowing money into your business
continually
it could be that your expenses are going
up because let's say you're
you're buying a new building you're
investing in some infrastructure
you're just putting all kinds of money
into that now this could be real money
expenses or depreciation but it could be
going up like crazy
at the same time though it's fine your
bank will give you loans
because your revenue is going up like
crazy too
and the hope is that someday you'll get
to the point
where you don't have to put in as much
every year
and you can just start harvesting the
benefits
a good example this is your cable
company
the the company that that is digging
ditches and putting cable in the ground
and connecting one neighborhood after
another
every time they connect a neighborhood
they make money from that neighborhood
so that so that neighborhood that the
cable company connected
is now profitable but the company itself
is not profitable
only that neighborhood because they have
already put in two new neighborhoods
that are not
yet profitable as those new ones become
profitable
now you've got three profitable ones yay
if you stopped it there
you could immediately get your expenses
going down
while your income goes up hey you're
making money and you're paying taxes
but why would you you didn't start a
company
you didn't start a company to get to
some point and then just level off
you started a company to grow forever
and the best way to grow forever is to
keep getting bank loans
to keep getting financing private
financing etc
as long as your revenue is going up and
it looks like it could
cross over in the future the banks will
give you all the money you want
people will buy all the stock that you
want you can give financing easily
and cheaply now i don't know if
president trump's
situation is like the one i described
but what's important is
neither do you we don't know
now maybe if i looked at the details of
his tax returns i could
i could deduce this i'm not sure i could
but if the if the news has not
described to you if this is a normal
situation
of a growing company is he is he plowing
his money back into
assets that are creating jobs and
creating other kinds of taxes that's the
best situation you could possibly have
now it turns out that as an attack on
the president
it's really really effective because how
many people
how many people understand this little
lesson that i just gave you
if you were to guess what percentage of
the general public
understands that you can't compare an
average
wage earners taxes to a big company
and that there are good reasons you
can't compare them what percentage of
the company
do you think or of the of the country do
you think knows that
i would say 20 percent
tops yeah somebody's guessing 20 percent
somebody says 5
ten percent is somewhere in that range
it's definitely not more than twenty
percent
but it's probably in the five to twenty
percent range
now having explained it to you
we're good now right everybody who sees
an explanation like
this you know they didn't used to know
but now they've seen the explanation
oh good i guess that problem is solved
we used to be ignorant
but now we've been informed so i guess i
guess we're all good
no doesn't work like that
it's not just that twenty percent of the
country are the only ones who understand
this
it is that twenty percent of the country
might be the only ones
capable of understanding it which is a
horrible thing to think
but it's true something like i would
guess this
is true something like maybe twenty
percent of the public
has the raw intellect and the
enough you know context and background
and enough of a talent stack
to even understand what i just said
it's kind of complicated i would guess
that there are a whole bunch of people
who watch this
saw this maybe for the first time some
of you
and are saying to yourself i think i
kind of follow that
but i'm a little hazy on the
depreciation part i kind of need to see
that explained a few more times
which would be perfectly normal trust me
if you if you go to school for you know
economics or
accounting or something like that the
first time you're introduced
to the idea of cash flow being different
from income
and depreciation being this invisible
expense
the first time you see this stuff it
doesn't really stick
you kind of need to you know be
introduced to it over and over again
before it sticks
so as a political attack it's just
brilliant
but it is completely
disruptible disreputable it is
it is not good behavior
let's just say this the attack on
trump's taxes
if they were honest players this is what
it would look like
if the critics were honest okay
we thought we would find a whole bunch
of criminal activity here
we didn't find any okay that would be
the first honest thing they would say
because unless they're hiding something
you know waiting for later and it seems
unlikely
they found nothing so the first thing
they should say is
all those things that we thought were
going to be big problems
we didn't find any that would that would
be an honest
statement but instead they've
suggested that there are problems when
it is not demonstrated that there is
here is another example if you look at
cnn the way they're
covering it they say stuff like this
president trump has a 300 million dollar
loan personally guaranteed
that's coming due so you say to yourself
whoa
that that's that's bad right 300 million
dollar loan coming due
sounds bad and then you say to yourself
cnn would say and what would you do
if you needed 300 million dollars and
you're the president
and let's say let's say russia might be
a future
place that you think you might get some
money what would you do
would you be a little nice to russia
because it might help your
financing later in your own personal
life
that's the cnn the cnn
take let me explain to you
what they don't know or are lying about
i don't know they either don't know or
they're lying
a large company with a large loan coming
due
how should you value that what what
should your brain
do when you hear that there's a big
company with a 300 million dollar loan
coming due
here is the correct way to analyze that
so that's it that's the entire
analysis there's a big loan coming due
in a big company
so that is the most routine thing in the
world
do companies pay off their gigantic
loans
before they're due sometimes sometimes
they just refinance
the only thing that matters is if the
company is producing enough cash
to pay the loan if you're a bank and and
the
loan is coming due but the you know the
borrower
is making plenty of cash that's all you
care about you don't care about his
income statement
you don't care that on paper it looks
like he's not making money
you care that his bank account is
producing cash
because you don't get paid with uh
conceptual money
you're the bank you want actual money
if the company is producing actual money
and it's enough to service the loan the
bank
loves you the bank will fight over you
the bank will compete for your business
they love to give you money so which is
this situation
is this a situation where there's not
enough cash flow
and the president's really in trouble
well they've kind of suggested that
haven't they
they've kind of suggested that's the
case
but they haven't demonstrated it they've
they've produced
no evidence to suggest that it's even a
little bit of a problem
might it be a problem sure sure
it might be a problem but in most cases
it would not be
if they don't tell you does he have
enough cash flow
to service the loan they have told you
nothing
the amount of the loan irrelevant
the fact that it's coming due irrelevant
if you have cash flow that's all that
matters
what you tell me how much reporting
there will be on cash flow there won't
be any
right there won't be any reporting on
cash flow
because cash flow is the story that
probably makes trump look good
when trump talked about his balance
sheet before these taxes came out
when he was talking about him do you did
he ever notice the way he talked
he talked about having a strong balance
sheet and good cash flow
he did not say on paper i have a big
income
because that would be dumb what you want
is the biggest cash flow
and the smallest paper profit
did he do that don't know because the
reporting is silent on his cash flow
so far so in other words the people who
understand to have a look at this would
say
wait a minute i don't care about any of
that stuff there's nothing on the taxes
that's really that important what
matters
is the cash and where's that reporting
where's all the reporting on the cash
also known as
the only thing that matters all right
when you see
somebody says next explain the ebitda
we won't be explaining that today
keep it easy all right um
the trump lawyers have said that the
quote the new york times story is little
riddled with gross inaccuracies
now what does that mean when trump's
lawyers say that the story is
riddled with gross inaccuracies does
that mean
that they don't actually have the actual
taxes
it could you could interpret it that way
but it could it could mean that they
have exactly the right taxes
but the way they're interpreting them is
so selective
that is grossly misleading so the
lawyers have very cleverly worded it
so it allows two interpretations one
they don't have actual taxes it's more
of a you know a fake news thing
or two they do but they're explaining it
all wrong to confuse you
i would say the second part is
unambiguously true
as i just explained but we don't know if
they have the real taxes
given that the southern district of new
york presumably has those taxes
and they hate the president it probably
got
leaked from the southern district of new
york which would be
a very big crime it's a felony so
there's somebody who committed a felony
and then and that might actually include
the new york times
there's some i'm not a lawyer so i can't
speak to this
but there are some people who seem to
suggest
that the new york times broke the law by
printing it
i doubt that they would be in legal
trouble i feel as though they would
claim that there's enough of a
need to know in the public that uh that
it was okay
we'll see all right the
thing that makes this argument so
devastating is that
the entire protests and you know the the
way that the democrats feel
is they have this sense of unfairness
a sense of unfairness and the sense of
unfairness
is not based on anything uh objective or
smart
it's just how you feel so if you have um
you know if you have a million dollars
and there's somebody who has a hundred
billion dollars
you find you kind of hate them because
you're
unfortunately uh we're we're sort of
built that way
we're built were built to envy and maybe
think poorly of somebody who's doing
better so
because this fits so perfectly into the
the democrat world view
that there's something you know with
unfairness in the world
it's really good it really fits their
their message pretty well
and indeed uh rasmussen is teasing that
the president's approval rating
took a steep dive last night
i think uh or recently so the
president's
approval did recently take a steep dive
these are just the overnights so they
might not be
you know a long-term effect
joshua ganz who's an economist uh
i mention him uh often uh he had this
tweet which i thought was funny
uh this will be the sort of thing that
when you hear it
you're gonna say why didn't anybody else
think of that
you know one of those where you go
that's true
here it is he says the thing about the
new york tax
new york times tax story is that trump
doesn't have to release
all of his tax returns to show it's fake
news
just one page of one submitted return
would get it done so in other words he
could just say
hey new york times if you think you have
my actual tax returns
release one page i will allow you to
release one page
maybe pick one of the pages that doesn't
have much on it that's
you know controversial and say just just
show us
page 23 you know about this
let's see if it matches mine
uh somebody says read trump tweets
does he have some fresh ones that are
fun
maybe if i have time i'll do that all
right
so joshua is correct it would be easy
for trump
to prove that they don't have the real
tax returns
but i'm not expecting that to happen
because my expectation is that they do
have the real tax returns
but that they're telling a misleading
story about them
all right um
i wonder this is another one of those
cases where
all the people who believed that there
would be all kinds of crimes in his
taxes
those people now have to go back and say
all right
i was wrong about something i was
totally positive would be true
so i believe that there would not be
indications of crimes in his taxes
but there would be you know people would
imagine they saw them
so i think my estimate of where this was
going to end up was
pretty close if yours was not reassess
how good your predictions are
all right so
financial illiteracy is sweeping the
country of course
so everybody's going to be talking about
depreciation and explaining it to other
people
but none of it's really going to matter
because we're in a world where
it goes without saying at this point do
you remember in 2016 when i said that
facts don't matter
and that people don't make up their mind
based on facts
do you remember that all right people
are begging me to read
trump's tweet so there's got to be
something going on here that's
that's good well let's see what trump's
up to
uh he see
joe biden announced that he won't agree
to a drug test
uh bringing up my taxes all the time
bad intentions is there something here
that's
especially good uh
proper shows that i'm only president
i have very little debt compared to the
value of assets
there we go he has very little debt
compared to his assets now that's that's
the
finance way of saying that he's not
going to have trouble getting bank loans
you know
okay i have no idea why you needed me to
look at that
because i don't think that told me
anything right the other big story
we'll get to let's see if i said
anything i want to say about this
oh so cnn's take is that he will be
desperate for money
and he the only reason he's president is
to make money because he needs money to
to save his struggling businesses now i
don't think that's the case
um i don't think that's the case but let
me ask you this
what president would not want
a billion dollars right or what
president
would not want to get rich
do we produce presidents who don't have
any
any personal ambition or cannot be
bribed
it seems to me that any president who
wasn't already rich
is a risk for bribery right
wouldn't that be true of every president
if you had a president who
um you know let's say he needed some
money to pay off a loan
is that really a big difference with
somebody who just
might appreciate a hundred million
dollars after leaving office
i feel like they all have a bribery risk
i i don't know that you could really say
that one is worse than the other
because the the dollar amounts would be
so big
um all right project veritas uh
as you know project veritas
uh just came up with an expose
of mail-in vote fraud
and it looks like a good one meaning
that they have
uh on video somebody who says that he
personally
was part of a larger operation in elan
omar's
territory in minneapolis to
collect the the ballots whether they're
filled out or empty from let's say
senior citizens and other people
and to fill them out themselves i guess
so
massive vote fraud appears to be
demonstrated
and it appears to be demonstrated in a
massive way
and it appears to be maybe even decisive
meaning that it may be the only reason
that eulan omar can stay in office
is by ringing the vote every time so
that should it should change the story
right
now in a rational world where one side
is claimed there's no such thing
as widespread voter fraud with mail-in
ballots that's the claim
there there they've continued to push
that claim
nope there's no evidence can't find any
widespread
uh voter problems and then you show it
to them
what what should happen in a rational
world
it should look like this oh my goodness
i sure am surprised my old opinion
has to be revised now that we can
clearly see
that in this one location it was so easy
to do
we should assume that even though this
is the
the place that it was spotted we should
probably
assume it's happened in other places
because look how easy it was
moronically easy to cheat in this one
place minneapolis
wouldn't you expect that somebody else
in the country has figured this out
and if such activity were to happen in
tight races
well it could be the difference so we
should expect that by this afternoon
everyone who's been making the claim the
widespread
mail-in voting doesn't have issues
every one of them including the fbi
and everybody who's looked into it every
one of them will be
apologizing to the public right
don't you think i mean obviously they
found out they were wrong
on something that's terribly terribly
important and we really really need to
know
what is true and what isn't and they
misled us
so now they'll all be apologizing today
right that's that's how it works
right no no
we're we've reached a point where you
can just say it didn't happen
the the the democrats will simply
just act like it didn't happen that's it
and
do you know how they're doing that
they're saying project veritas
well you know they're they're not
credible that's it
that's all they have to do they have
they have primed
their viewers and supporters to the
point where they can just tell them
anything
it doesn't matter what they say they can
just say um
let's pick a dumbass excuse from the
list uh
randomly uh oh we'll just we'll just say
the source is bad
that's it goes away now
because they control so much of the the
news
business all i have to do is just
ignore it that's it and it just goes
away
it should be one of the biggest stories
of the year
and they're just going to make it move
go away and they're going to do it right
in front of you
and it'll be incredible all right
um and of course every story is
something about
trump being beholden to putin i guess i
guess that's what
i guess every story has to have that
connection to it
um fareed zakaria did a really good job
of explaining what could happen that
would get trump
elected without him doing anything
devious even if he didn't win
so i i'd never seen the frame this way
so
you know and i recommend for fareed
zakario's
show because i find he's just unusually
good at explaining things
and he's unusually good with his guests
so even if you don't agree with him
on politics it's worth watching if
you want to make sure you've you've seen
the whole field
here's a real good watch um but he
explained it this way and i'll see if i
can do as
good a job there is a scenario in which
because the mail-in votes are coming in
late and there's disagreement among the
electoral college the people who are in
the electoral college
if you get to the point where the states
just can't agree
it goes to a vote of the states and
every vote every state gets one vote
and there are more there are more
republican states
so even though by population the
democrats have more people
because of this old constitutional rule
that just says well if we can't figure
it out the normal way
if if our attempt to have a fair vote an
electoral college
and a credible result if it just doesn't
work our
our fallback position is every state
gets one vote
and there we go so trump
simply needs to create enough doubt
about the outcome because of mail-in
votes or anything else
as long as there's doubt about the
income he personally doesn't have to do
anything
because it's the states that would just
do their thing
without any involvement from the federal
government he would just
sit back and say you know
it's not up to me i'll just follow the
rules wherever they lead
i'm just saying that this vote did not
look
credible to me do what you need to do
with that
now if enough of the states agree and
say you know
you got a point we we found this
irregularity here
and there was an irregularity here and
there's still votes coming in
and we tried the best we could we really
thought this would work
but in the end we have to admit
if you're just being objective it didn't
work
it's very very likely i'm going to say
somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to
70 percent
chance that that's how we'll feel after
the vote
even after a few weeks after the vote
we're going to feel like
we're not quite sure we believe the
outcome
don't you think probably a 70 chance
you're not going to believe the outcome
whichever way it goes you're still not
you even if your team wins
you're still privately going to be
thinking i'm glad i won
but i'm not sure i believe it you know
that's
that's what the count was but i'm not
sure i believe it
if that happens trump gets reelected
and and there's nothing he needs to do
he doesn't need to be a dictator
he doesn't need to invoke the military
he doesn't need to refuse to leave the
white house
he just needs to follow the rules that
the states
the states will perform for him it was
good to know a good
um good addition by for reed to our
understanding
um i understand that in the
uh debate tomorrow uh that chris wallace
will not be doing
any fact checking would you want
the debate moderator to do fact checking
i have to think that while you think to
yourself
yeah you know that would be useful if he
did some fact checking in real time
while it's happening
that could be useful but i don't think
it is
because first of all nobody would feel
it was fair
if he did a little more fact checking
for one than the other everybody would
complain
so as soon as he starts fact checking it
becomes this whole new thing to complain
about
and everybody would say well you
fact-checked it but you fact-checked it
wrong
so you really can't win with the
fact-checking
so if you don't have fact-checking and
especially because there's a time limit
you would use up all your time with fact
checking if you did it
what good are the debates are they any
good at all
now these debates are unique
because the biggest question is whether
biden can get through it
without having some kind of a mental
collapse
right so really the only thing we're
looking for
is joe biden's mental collapse we're not
looking for
facts we're you know we're not really
going to learn too much about
policies that we didn't already know
we're just looking to see if he can
stand up there for 90 minutes and not
become a blithering idiot
now if i had to put odds on it
i would say that the odds are
probably better than 50 percent and
probably a lot better than 50
that biden will have a good night
meaning that he'll just
blather his biden stuff and he'll just
do
you know from memory he'll just say what
he needs to say
and he'll probably have angry biden
moments where he gets that furrowed
brow and and acts like he's indignant
and angry about everything
but probably won't go so far that he
just has a complete meltdown
i think there's a solid up up with some
odds on it
i think there's a 30 chance
that biden will have a meltdown that
everybody sees
and and everybody agrees oh that doesn't
look good
probably a 30 chance of that 70
chance he actually has a good night and
and
you know he rests up and he's sharp and
who knows if they shoot him up with
chemicals i think maybe they do
maybe they do possibly uh
i i don't know what the odds of that are
but at least
at least 50 chance i'd say he gets a
little shot in the ass or something
um so i think he'll probably be fine
i will be watching the debates with
christina i don't think we're gonna
live stream but i might be uh i might be
texting while it's on
um he's done debate
prep half the month yeah he disappears a
lot
have we heard yet if uh biden has put
the lid on
is the lid on yet oh there's a really
good
bingo bingo board
from uh oh my god what's the name
of uh john show there uh adam curry
john devorak's show uh somebody tell me
in the comments the name of their
it's a no no agenda so
if you look for the no agenda podcast or
there must be a website or something
they have a bingo card of things that
biden says and it's pretty hilarious
and actually it would be fun to
literally play at a home
so look for that the no agenda
bingo card for biden just google it
it'll probably pop up
reporters say he should get mad but they
describe him as the nice one
yeah we don't know if there's a lid yet
um all right so i think we've done what
we need to do today
that's my lesson on finance and we will
talk to you tomorrow
