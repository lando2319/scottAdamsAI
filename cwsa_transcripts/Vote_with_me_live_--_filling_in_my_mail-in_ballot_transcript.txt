H good evening
everybody come on there a stream on in
here it's a special Evening
Edition we will be voting we'll be
voting
like like we've never voted before which
is almost true in my
case there we
go there we
go vote hard vote
fast vote like your life depends on it
all right how many of you are actually
going to vote with me and how many are
just going to hang out either one's fine
but uh don't show your don't show your
Val ballots on on the uh video okay do
not show your ballots I'm not going to
show you mine except hey I got an
envelope
so here's the truth I don't think I've
ever voted by mail not that I can
remember I'm not sure I know
how so I usually get confused by easy
stuff like
this so I thought that I would uh maybe
help walk through it all right so I get
my ballot in the
mail uh I don't remember requesting it I
guess you just got
it California
now normally I wouldn't care about
voting in California because my vote
wouldn't
matter
but uh it might matter who wins the
popular vote this time just in terms of
credibility all right so what do we got
we got a business
reply so I've got an envelope to put it
in I've got a assist
vant if I learn to speak Spanish I can
guess some instr
CS uh show us your I voted
sticker so I guess I get to put this
sticker on but I can't get the sticker
off all right well we'll we'll save this
I'll put this on after I
vote all right who else is voting any
other voters there I I want to know that
there's at least one
person who's going to vote just because
I'm doing this
someone who otherwise would have said ah
what's the
difference but now because I'm doing it
the peer pressure the peer pressure is
Extreme all right we got some we got
some voters I I didn't want to go this
year without getting some people to vote
who wouldn't have
voted I I feel like that was my mission
I don't have to get a lot you know if
everybody just gets one that's
plenty so let's see I guess this would
be my
ballot how long will it take me to
figure out how to use
this all right returning your ballot oh
God look at all the
instructions how hard are they going to
make
it uh I got to separate each B fold each
one insert it
separately no postage
okay so basically folding is going to be
the hard part what's the back
say back says very similar things except
inser
so de Devolution
proportion and I think I got the accent
perfect I mean before you say it I'll
say it all right so it looks like the
ballot is a bunch of individual
Pages all right I've literally never
seen one of these
before director of
entertainment that can't be
real what is
this oh it's a how to mark your ballot
so there's an entertain there's a
there's an example
one so this is California so yours would
be different
so completely fill the
oval fill in the oval next to the word
yes or
no all right basically there's a whole
page of Destruction instructions on how
to fill in a an
oval got it I got it I'm going to fill
in that oval like a mofo all right now
we get to the
ballots now here's why I would never
have voted without you
my
ADHD would never ever have allowed me to
get this far into the
paperwork I'm now about 50% further than
I could have possibly gotten on my own
and it's only because you're watching
which by the way is one of the tricks
for ADHD you just get a buddy to watch
you all right looks like we got a bunch
of blanks here but got a terrible
lighting situation so going have to
improve my lighting all right I got my
pen all right so the first one is
President and Vice President we got
Kennedy Chase
Oliver Chase
Oliver you know I didn't know Chase
Oliver was running for
president but
uh you know now that I think about it
Chase Oliver that's a heck of a name for
a president I don't know I might change
my vote to chase
Oliver no not really just joking but
there is somebody with that name running
also Jill Stein and Rudolph
wear Trump
Advance Claudia De La
Cruz con Lis and Tim Walls you know it
probably does matter if your name is at
the last the last one on the
list I'll bet that statistically that
makes a difference and then it makes me
wonder do they print the ballots so that
there's uh that they're
randomized if they did that they
wouldn't be able to
necessarily um automatically count the
ballots interesting all right well we're
going to vote for
president I'm not going to tell you who
I'm going to vote
for no I'm not even going to mention who
I'm going to vote for you're just going
to have to guess because it's sort of a
sort of a secret
thing who am I going to vote for let's
see I have a real good feeling about
Chase Oliver no not not cheese
H all right oh there is a write in place
but it's too late to write myself in all
right on the back there's going to be a
whole bunch of things I don't know
anything about
uh Adam Schiff or Steve
Garvey I get to vote against Adam
Chef oh my God I would have like all you
had to do is tell me I get to vote
against Adam MAF I'd be all over it I'm
not going to tell you what I am
voting but sure would be fun to vote
against Adam
shiff I don't think he could get the
first base against Steve
Garvey all right who else we got
here um it looks like there's a separate
vote if you speak
Spanish so I can vote for Adam Schiff in
English or in
Spanish how about uh the 14th kest oh oh
we also have Eric
swell and Vin crud
I've never heard of
in but I've heard of Eric
swell God this is fun I should vote
every
year nobody told me there were so many
people I hated that would be on the
ballot so
Vin might be a lucky day all right Jerry
mcer is running against Jim shoemaker
um here's how I decide that uh one day
when I was at my health club Jerry
mackinery
introduced himself because he recognized
me and sat down and talked to me and I
thought to myself that's a nice guy he
looks like he knows what he's doing Jim
shoemaker who's a republican running
against him I've never heard of him and
don't know anything about him I don't
think he makes shoes I think that's just
his name
but uh H it's tough the guy I like or
the guy I never heard
of well I'm not going to tell
you you're just going to have to
guess because you'll have no idea who I
vote for no idea all right 16th assembly
Rebecca Bower Khan are you guys all
voting is everybody voting with
me by now you should be on your first
page of
ballots do we go for Bower Kon or
rube I never heard of either one of them
see one's a republican one's a
Democrat I wonder who I'll vote
for can't tell you it's big old
secret boy I'm terrible at filling in
circles that's one thing I
learned I'm in California right
[Music]
now oh you're talking to somebody
else all right how many people we got
here so we got 800 300 and 300 so 6 all
right 1400 people well more than that
because X doesn't show me the number so
we probably have 2,000 people
live and in the comments I'm going to
ask you again in the comments tell me is
there anybody who's voting now just
because we're doing this who probably
wouldn't have voted I want to find out
if there's you know a few people who
definitely would not have voted except
that I'm prodding you and doing it with
you
anybody in the comments Let It
Rain well we didn't have to say
no and no is the default answer oh I'm
getting some
yeses all right we're getting some yeses
good all right I done my job my job was
to make sure that I got at least a few
other people to
vote you know I didn't have to do
everything I don't have I don't have to
be Scott presler but if everybody could
get a few people to vote we're in pretty
good
shape all right who do I need for the
laboratory scientist because I totally
knew that was a
thing a oh no he's a retired laboratory
scientist no that's just what he is is
what the hell am I voting
for the
school why is it all in
Spanish I have no idea what this is tell
me nonpartisan offices cargos no partos
schoolo shabo then a bunch of
colleges vote for
one the incumbent
no I no idea what this is I have no idea
what even the job is something about
schools trustee or College District
trustee what the hell is that College
District trustee do you think the
College District trustee was doing a
good job oh interestingly these do not
show up as either Republican or
Democrat very interesting so one of them
is the incumbent and the other is
retired laboratory
scientist
well how am I not going to vote for the
scientist there's no reason to think the
scientist is the best one in this case
I'm not yeah I'm going to leave that
blank I have nothing to add to that
decision all
right how about these other nonpartisan
offices sh pammer price be recalled oh
we' we've got a Soros prosecutor recall
question yes I signed the uh petition
there there were tons of people
collecting signatures at the grocery
store so I've already signed the
petition to get it on the
ballot and shall she be recalled from
the office of district attorney C
Senor C
Senor now that was the reason to vote
you know here I am thinking you know
California doesn't matter to the
presidency but I can I can help vote out
the Soros
prosecutor that's that's like a really
meaningful
vote I mean that could be the one that
keeps me out of
jail all right how about this one for
mayor of Pleasanton oh okay the two
Mayors are people I do not
know Jack
Balch or Carl lebrown
whose name sounds more like a
mayor do I want to say mayor
Balch or Mayor
Brown Mayor Brown sounds more
substantial doesn't it mayor
balls I don't know I don't think that
name is Mayor
worthy probably has many other qualities
I don't know him whatsoever but um
Council member in a
CPA I'm going to skip that
one uh council member never heard of
those two oh but I'm not going to skip
this
one
well okay I'm not going to tell you why
I'm making that
vote but I feel good about
it and bar director
the one that's appointed or a retired
laboratory scientist again there's
another there are two retired laboratory
scientists running for different jobs on
my
ballot we have a lot of retired
laboratory scientists around my
area all right uh I think I'll go for
the uh I don't know let's skip that
one all right now we're up to
the these must be the state measures so
these are the various
measures uh bonds for public
schools so here's a true
story years ago when I worked at Pacific
Bell an election was coming up and my
boss at the time who coincidentally was
the one who named Dilbert he came up
with the name Dilbert he'd seen it
before and he was very Republican and he
was he was all getting ready to vote and
I said how can you possibly
intelligently vote when you get all
these weird you know ballot uh measures
these these basically ballot measures
are they're basically laws that you get
to vote on and I was like how do you
know which ones of these are good ideas
and he looks at me and he says I vote
against everything that costs
money and I thought oh you you fool you
fool what a onedimensional
ridiculous way to run a country you just
vote against anything that cost money Ju
Just anything like it could be the best
thing in the world and you're just
you're just going to vote against it
because it costs money how do you
possibly
justify that I said and he
said they have enough money and I said
are you kidding me that's crazy that's
crazy because sometimes you need more
money and he said they can take it from
something else they're doing and I said
that's
so exactly the way everybody else runs
their
life and that was the moment I realized
he was the smartest person I've ever
met he he's the only person I've ever
met who had a political philosophy that
was 100%
tight they have enough
money if they need more take it from
something else they're
doing and I thought to myself if you
could really hold them to that that
would work that would work if you if you
could force them do it it's just that
people don't assume that they can so
they vote for the
money so this
vote is for you
Mike the late Mike Goodwin
nope um constitutional right to marriage
why why is that why do we have to talk
about
that fundamental right to marriage
no fiscal why do I care we that's
already the current
situation I don't
care I'll say yes marry anybody you want
doesn't cost me a
penny uh authorized bonds for Safe
Drinking Water oh okay
well I might not be able to help Mike
Mike my old boss on this one turns out
that our drinking water is uh in bad
shape so we've got a bunch of forever
chemicals I just I just paid $1,500 to
have my own well uh tested because I
think I'm going to have to shut it down
I think it's poisoned I think my well is
actually poisoned um and the town water
20% of the water was poison in the wells
they have other sources but the wells
were poison uh I got a bunch of forever
chemicals I think I've been sucking down
those forever chemicals
forever so do we need a bond for Safe
Drinking Water and wildfiree prevention
and protecting communities and natural
lands from climate risk
uh they had to throw in the climate
change didn't
they
nope nope if you clowns can't keep the
climate change and you're drinking water
I'll drink
Pepsi allows local bonds for affordable
housing and public
infrastructure if you have 55 % voter
approval no we don't need that what are
you talking
about no you don't get any more of my
money why do you need my money to build
a
house all you need to do is get rid of
the regulations preventing people from
doing the thing they want to do don't
ask me for more money build a
house how about
uh what eliminates uh the law for
involuntary servitude for Inc basically
eliminates making prisoners
work it removes the provision that
allows prisons to impose involuntary
servitude to punish people for
incarceration potential increase or
decrease in state local cost depending
how things
go
huh do we want workers to be forced to
work picking up garbage and
stuff how how is it how is it better to
stay in your
cell if you were in jail wouldn't you
love the day when you're walking around
you know poking some garbage with a
stick and you're in the sunshine
wouldn't that be like a hundred times
better than being in your
cell I'm a little confused like how how
hard is the work
not making them break rocks they're kind
of just wandering around picking up you
know rappers and
stuff does it really
matter see this is the sort of thing
people like me shouldn't be voting on at
all because we don't know the
details uh but I'm going to so since
it's poorly explained I'm not going to
vote for
it raises minimum wage oh this is
interesting for employees where employ
employers with 26 or more employees to
$17 and then quickly up to
18$ 17 to18 minimum wage in
California well raising the minimum
wage um in theory is always bad
right would do you agree that from a
pure economics point of view it's
generally bad
because if there's somebody who's
willing to work for that minimum wage
they should not be denied that
opportunity um and there's plenty of
people who already have a roof and you
know they just need some extra money
um I don't
know minimum wage I have mixed feeling
about minimum
wage the the uh the Lefty in me you know
because I'm a little of
both um does believe that you shouldn't
be turning people into slaves because
they're bad at negotiating and you know
they didn't maybe they don't have a
talent stack that can give them a better
job so I don't
love something that's basically just a a
form of slavery
practically so I do think people should
have a a living wage but the minimum
wage is so far from something that would
allow you to live on your own or you
know start a family or something I don't
think it makes any difference like it
doesn't get you to the next
level and if you're working minimum wage
the thing you should be doing is you
know working really fast to stop doing
that and to make sure that you get
promoted and get a better wage so nobody
should be spending much time at minimum
wage it should be really just an entry
level
and entry level there's no real argument
that it needs to be enough to you know
completely support
you
so think I won't tell you what I'm going
to vote on this
one cost could increase or
decrease uh revenues likely would
decrease opponents
the opponents are the Chamber of
Commerce California Restaurant
Association and California groceries
Association
well
yeah got to say
no yes you know see the trouble is that
there are entire industries that are set
up for a uh non nonh High minimum wage
situation and they're pretty critical in
California
rent control
nope that's easy no rent
control you're not going to have any
housing if you have rent
control how's everybody else
doing are you almost done with
yours all
right I think we're we're doing some
good work
here uh we got uh got lots of people
watching so if you haven't voted yet and
you've got your mail and vote all we're
doing is voting together so that we
don't forget and we feel like we did it
at the same time all right good job good
job we got to
vote you know I don't think any of none
of you none of you saved your voting
just for this right I mean you didn't
need to do that but
you read the guide ahead of time you
high
achiever restrict spending of
prescription jobs by certain Health Care
Providers why am I restricting the free
market
because uh I Federal Federal disc on
Direct patient care oh okay
yes that seems like that's
sensible it wasn't what I thought it was
how about provides permanent funding for
Medical Healthcare Services well what
else are we going to do if we have
medical keal how are you going
to of course this is this is
the the mic test
again do I give them more money or do I
say take it from something
else short-term State costs between 1
billion and 2 billion so I'd be voting
to
increase I'm going to say
no I don't know what the you're
doing that it's going to increase my
cost by $2 billion
but you're going to have to do better
than
that felony charges and increased
sentences for certain drug and theft
crimes yes thank you very much trying to
rec criminalize crime in
California I'm in
and then
finally essential Services protection
[Music]
measure to minimize Cuts in police and
[Music]
fire
um a half a cent sales
tax providing 10 million annually for 10
years I do want to I do want my local
police and fire departments to be well
funded
but I also
think they have enough of my
money I don't
know I haven't noticed the shortage of
police um because they come whenever my
neighborhood needs
them uh haven't noticed a shortage of
fire departments unless they're talking
about the in in the forests where we
need
them oh do I want another half a cent
sales
tax
well there we go all right
now I've got to read the careful
instructions about how to put it in an
envelope everyone is separate and folded
in half and you separately put them in
the
envelope so
separate um did I really not have to
sign
anything did did I really not have to
sign
anything or or prove who I
am is that is this
real am I doing something wrong is there
really no there's really no part where I
sign it
that can't be
true is that
true is it true that there's no place to
sign
it you sign the
envelope oh on the
envelope why the hell am I going to put
my signature on the outside of an
envelope can't everybody just copy my
signature what
uh I am unable to return my balance to
hereby authoriz oh you can have
something else do it I
guess s signature of voter or the power
of
attorney
okay well I will put in my
envelopes so they have to go in upside
down is there any special way they go in
looks like they go
in fold on the
top all right
so they'll digitize
it all right should I use my regular
signature or make it look like somebody
else today is the uh resident address
has registered in
lmon okay my address
which
is okay they don't have enough room for
my address what do you
do what if you do if there's not enough
room for it
of course I'm writing it right next to
my
address so you can't see it but but on
the envelope there's a place where I
write my address and it's right next to
the box with my address that's printed
there shouldn't I just be able to check
the box that says that's my
address do I really have to write my
address next to my address that that's
something I'm really doing writing my
address next to my
address that's a real thing that just
happened all right now I have to lick
this
thing how do they notice my own
handwriting okay I need RFK
Jr RFK junr is it okay if I lick this
thing what kind of forever chemicals are
on the ovelo
RFK Jr I need
you just
kidding all right ladies and
gentlemen I got
myself
ballot that means I get to wear this
unlike all you losers who didn't
vote I'm a patriot now I haven't mailed
it but I promise I
will I will mail it I might bring it to
the uh might I might deliver it
myself I did get directions to the
deliver it myself Place actually I might
do that just for the fun of
it take it to a Dropbox
you're mailing it in after your rent
about the USBs yes see here's the
thing while I oh by the way did did you
see the latest Kraken
claim so remember how Sydney
Powell uh her her life got turned upside
down because she said the voting machine
machines had some crazy Venezuelan
connection well that rumor is back on
steroids uh with lots of details now I
have no idea if any of it's true um
really I have no idea it's like I'm just
looking at it I go I don't know I can't
tell there's tons of
detail um and you know an alleged
whistleblower
but you never
know and the the allegations are that
the there's some apparently there's so
this is just the allegations I I don't
you know I have no evidence that this is
real but the allegation is that the
biggest cartel in the world is one you
didn't know
existed and that it's a Venezuelan gang
and that uh they've stolen like a
trillion dollars they're far bigger than
any other cartel and that allegedly and
here's the part where I'm not convinced
allegedly they do in fact privately own
all of the voting companies the voting
software and hardware and that uh the
elections haven't been real for a
while remember how I kept asking can
anybody give us any reason whatsoever
that machines exist for voting and
literally nobody has even one what even
hypothesis it's like they're faster no
no cheaper
no more
reliable
no um harder to hack
no so what is it if it's more expensive
and yet worse in every
way why do they do
it well I can only think of one reason
and that rumor which I don't have any
validity in you know I wouldn't have any
reason to believe it's true or or
false no way to know one way or the
other but it exists as a
rumor and that's not
nothing the ballot in Cook County was 21
pages long that's why it's digital
well digital might make sense
but that doesn't mean that the vote has
to
be uh does all sales text I don't
know all right there you
go my podcast looks like a Nazi
rally how much do you love that uh KL
Harris is doing so poorly that they
brought out James Carville to say that a
Madison Square Garden rally looks is is
intentionally designed to evoke Nazi
symbolism do you remember when I felt
like I had to defend the hoaxes because
people would believe the hoaxes but I'm
pretty sure that people when people hear
Carville say that using Madison Square G
Garden for an event which is what it's
for it's for events is not really
evident of any kind that you're Nazi
it's more like evidence that you booked
it for an event like everybody else
books it for an
event but it's funny to watch
uh to watch them try to sell that
actually just Carville Carville couldn't
even get a Democrat to bite on that one
he's been trying that for like two weeks
and can't get anybody else to say that
loud because it's so
dumb so dumb
all right if you mail you can track
online
interesting he's just
bullshitting I think he
is yeah the Atlantic has a new Trump hes
that one seems funny too so something
about he wanted generals like Hitler or
something and it's just so obviously not
true it's like laughably obviously not
true true and it's by the same hoaxer
who's who's famously hoaxed a bunch of
times that Jeffrey Goldberg
guy I I think we have to start or
stop uh calling some of these
Publications any kind of publication
they are pure
propaganda once something gets to the
level of pure
propaganda you shouldn't act like it's a
news source or something it's not an
opin
they're not even opinions they're just
propaganda now I wouldn't put CNN in
that category because they do in fact
show both sides not always but lately
they've done a great job of it um Daniel
Dale did a fact check on uh wall saying
that Trump lost the most manufacturing
jobs of any president turns out that's
not even close to
True uh and so Daniel Dale just slapped
him down now that's pretty good
even Fox News doesn't do that Fox News
doesn't do factchecking on Republicans
so I would call you know some of the
news are just
biased but if their bias is obvious and
they're not hiding it I'm not too bad
with that but to call MSNBC
news I'm sorry that's not news that is
just pure propaganda
I have I have voted as an adult it was
more embarrassing when I when I
voted uh more it was more embarrassing
because the first time I voted it might
have been I 22 or 21 or something and I
voted for Jimmy
Carter that was my first
vote and after I saw how that turned out
I realized wow I'm as dumb as the person
who made that comment just now
I shouldn't vote at all and neither
should
you I'm only talking to the person who
made the dumb
comment you know the one where you
hallucinate something and then get
really mad at it so somebody
hallucinated that I've never voted as an
adult and then they had something to say
about the thing that they
hallucinated oh here's an
update uh you know that uh Jen
yuger was looking for somebody to debate
on the question of
trump and um I did not uh reply to an
email fast enough because I'm bad on
email so I didn't have uh the
flexibility to schedule the debate he
was looking for but he quite uh
generously offered to have me on the
show so I will be on Jen show
essentially debating him but it'll be um
in addition to whatever debate he does
on the night that he said he was going
to do the debate so on Thursday he's
going to do
something H I think there might be
multiple people involved but I'm not one
of them and then on Monday I'll just
have my own time to talk to The Young
Turks or or just Jank I'm not
sure by the way I you know I have to
say um if I could pay him a
compliment that while there are plenty
of things that I don't agree with with
Jen I love his mental
flexibility like he is absolutely
willing to crap on either side including
his own uh when it looks like it needs
it now I don't have to agree with him to
appreciate that that he's not a captive
so he's definitely not a captive of
anybody's brainwashing and that's
unusual
so talking to somebody who's not a
captive but also doesn't agree with me
on everything to me that's kind of
exciting because it's pretty rare
situation usually you're just talking to
an NPC you know somebody who's just down
for their team and wants you to
lose um I think Jen is in a small very
narrow subset of people who would rather
have the right
answer than to win you like you'd rather
get the right answer uh uh and you have
to respect
that I think he's actually curious you
know I I think that even though it's
sort of a you know a challenge and an
event and it's sort of a you know it's a
podcasting thing it's a very podcasty
thing to do challenge somebody to a
debate on politics but I think he
actually wants to figure out if he's
missing something and that maybe maybe
you know the new silos are denying him a
better argu ment than he seen so we'll
see we'll
see all
right um I would talk about the machine
that colluded to cancel me well you know
I never know I'll never know who
colluded I'll just know that it's very
unlikely that I would have been
cancelled if I'd been someone
else so so think about
this uh Barack Obama
told black men that black men are
sexists and wouldn't support you know
too many of them wouldn't support a
female president what does that sound
like does that sound like outright
prejudice against a certain group of
people
and shouldn't he be canceled for that I
hear people get canceled when they make
broad statement ments about entire
groups of
people no okay I guess it doesn't work
that
way he's a David Pacman well we'll find
out David Pacman is a is one of the talk
overs meaning that
um he does he does the thing that the
least credible Democrats do which is
every statement you make they ask for a
source as if that's going to be possible
during a
conversation and then they talk over you
if you make a good
point and but I've watched I've watched
Jen and other conversations and he's not
a talk over he he doesn't talk over he
actually waits as long as it takes now
that's you know that's a luxury of doing
a podcast instead of a you know
broadcast TV you you more time but
that's hard to do in fact I watched I
specifically watched him in a split
screen conversation
with Murray maybe it was
Murray and I think Murray just insulted
him for like 10 minutes
straight Douglas Murray I think he
insulted him for like 10 minutes
straight and and Jen sat there just
listening and I thought oh my God
that that was that some super constraint
there now I assume that Douglas Murray
returned the favor and that when I
didn't see that part but when Jang
talked he probably let him talk so I'm
sure it was reciprocal but it's it's
fascinating oh I've got a I've got a
recommendation for
you I don't have a link for it but you
should be able to easily find it so on
YouTube um at the event that was
recently hosted by the all-in pod maybe
a few weeks ago they had a um
conversation between John Mir
shimer
and Jeffrey
sax now both of them are really smart
about geopolitical things and you know
what's happening with Russia China and
Israel and Hezbollah and Iran they don't
completely agree but wow it was the two
smartest persons you're ever going to
see talk about something that
important I I so recommend it it was one
of those very rare times when even
though the the topic is something you
think you've heard everything about
you'll be actually just D just you know
drilled onto the screen you'll be like
really so both of them are just
so um well informed but also good at
communicating
that it it comes off as way more
entertaining than I thought it would be
I I watched every minute of it and I
never did
that you're having trouble concentrating
on my third
eye well I'm just showing off I voted I
haven't mailed it so that doesn't count
yet all right how we
doing I think I'll stay on until the top
of the hour just to make everybody feel
bad if they come in and they see that
I'm wearing my vote on my
head and you
too could have an annoying sticker on
your
forehead you could be a douchebag too it
doesn't have to be just me it could be
you
too I put my sticker on the back of my
phone case well look at you oh yeah
Trump's going on Joe Rogan on
Friday
well look at the difference uh Trump
going on Joe Rogan to have no questions
in advance for three
hours compare that to K Harris takes the
day off to prepare for NBC the
friendliest of
friendlies uh who probably will give her
the questions in advance and probably
other people will write your answers to
just remember
the these two are not the
similar I I don't know I don't know how
anybody could watch this
unfolding and think that their
capabilities are similar I also wonder
about the people who think they live
through a modern hell in Trump's first
term what exactly did they experience in
his first term that wasn't just
Democrats acting out
I mean if you say the worst things that
happened were you know riots and antifa
and black lives matter riots and but
that wasn't
Trump that that was people who didn't
like Trump I don't
remember I don't remember anything that
Trump did that caused trouble do you
What did Trump do that cause any
trouble name
anything now I guess well I guess R for
suade you you could argue that that was
either the core or that was
Trump I guess you could say that's
Trump but that's not a but it's not a
point of him like being a bad character
it's about him giving Republicans what
they've wanted for 50 years or
whatever yeah the
Kraken the Kraken is what Sydney Powell
promised she would tell us meaning some
big monster called the Kraken that there
would be some kind of major reveal about
election fraud but she did not come
through with
it now remember the uh the mystery about
Sydney Powell do you remember I kept
saying why doesn't she just tell us who
told her the wrong information isn't
that the most obvious thing that you
wonder well if Sydney Powell was wrong
and that the election machines were fine
why was she so confident who who would
have told her they were not fine but
then lie to her apparently and here's
what I think here's my updated opinion
now this is a big if if it's true that
the biggest cartel is involved in all of
this then that's all you need to know
because the cartel would have said we're
going to kill everybody in your family
if you peep up again and then suddenly
she couldn't tell you where her sources
were does that sound like the real world
in the real world if any of this you
know gang relationship is true and I
don't know that is I I personally have
no information that would verify it if
it's true then you completely understand
why Sydney Powell went from I have all
the goods to um yeah maybe I just made
it up uh yeah let's let's go with let's
go with I don't have any
evidence it's the only thing that makes
sense she
probably either found out that the
source was bad and it was just you know
a setup or somebody threatened to kill
her or somebody that she cared about so
I think that maybe there was a death
threat
involved there you know I don't have any
evidence of that but if it's true that
the stakes are
this eye anything's on the
table anything at
all but I also heard that Dominion was
owned by the head of the carile group
and if that's true then it can't be true
that it's also owned by a Venezuelan
gang
so I I think I'm going to go with the
Venezuelan
gang uh stuff is not true
I I think that'll be my my holding
pattern my holding pattern will be not
believing
it but I'm open to hearing more
information about it if if there's any
other way to validate it I'll take a
look but I would say at this point the
odds of this new Kraken being Kraken 2
are pretty high pretty high because
almost everything that's come out lately
has been a hoax it would be weird if in
the middle of the most ho hoaxes you've
ever seen in your life that the exact
hoax you're waiting for comes down
exactly the way you know your
imagination had
it that's a little too on the nose so
I'm going to say this Venezuelan Kraken
thing that just came out not true I'm
going to go with not true that that's my
take but who
knows tentatively not true
Carville is looking more like a turtle
every
year good to
know uh they're going to deep fake Trump
saying something you know that would be
really deadly if they deep fake Trump
saying something like on the day before
the election because there's no way
there'd be time to tell everybody it was
a fake you know half of the country
would still think it was real a day
later so that would be dangerous
quite quite
dangerous
um because he's not prolife
okay uh absolutely confirmed the
Venezuelan gang took over apartment
buildings in
Aurora oh my oh interesting
I'm now supporting to fund the police on
the percent
oh okay back in 20 he wanted to defund
the police and now he wants to he's
confirmed that
the well like I said he's
flexible if you're going to show me that
he changed his mind because
the the facts were not with
him that's what I like about him that's
not a
flaw oh well we'll see we'll see that's
that's the beauty of it we'll find
out all right you just dropped off your
ballot watch for the Deep fakes so did
you see the latest hoax about
Biden so there's a Biden rupar
hoax all right so the uh the Biden hoax
uh I'm calling it a hoax because the
story is that Biden said um that we
should jail
Trump now he did say that but they cut
out the context
uh the
context was somebody in the audience
saying something like you know lock
somebody up and and then Biden sort of
equipped you know we should lock Trump
up but as soon as he equpped it he
corrected it and said you know in a
political
sense so he he immediately made sure you
knew he didn't mean in a in a jail cell
sense but in a political sense now if
you didn't hear the second part and that
got cut off that he immediately said he
doesn't he that he only means it in the
political sense then it looks like he
meant it in the physical sense just a
rupar he's about to get Charlotte build
he might
what's
that
104 quomo talked about Trump's
persuasion today hey how about
that well you know the one thing that uh
everybody agrees on is a Trump's
persuasive even if they don't like it
so Iraq is what turned him from a Dem
Republican to into a Democrat that's
fair if if if Jen used to be a
republican but he switched because of
the Iraq
invasion that's a good enough reason for
me I I would call that very
credible yeah no problem with
that that certainly that certainly would
be a fair
assessment what's that you realize that
they're feeding off your ideas who is
who's feeding off my
[Music]
ideas feeding off my ideas
yeah the LA Times decided they would not
back K
Harris they're not going to back anybody
but I think that's probably remarkable
that they're not backing
her
uh Ben's got it wrong carile group
doesn't own it only two members of
the carile group own it
okay interesting maybe I should just not
I feel like I shouldn't repost anything
for two
weeks will the planes dealer endorse H
who
cares it makes sense you think this
because I think you want the least
intelligent people in the country so
you're tiing amusingly simple mind is
the most basic concepts every time I see
your comments I laugh at how intelligent
you
are Jank thinks I'm
dumb oh well good luck with that
guys you may have noticed that my
persuasion works in the long
run it doesn't work as much in the short
run so anyway all right I think I've
done what I need to do to now we're
going to we're going to go back to sleep
everybody I will see you in the
morning uh on the Regular Show thanks
for voting with me I think we changed
the world with our votes it's going to
make the difference all right thanks
everybody for stopping
by um I'm I'm going to make sure that
you say goodbye there you go you heard
me and I'll see you in the morning
thanks for joining
