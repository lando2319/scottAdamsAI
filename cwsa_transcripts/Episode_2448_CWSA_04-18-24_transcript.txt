stalling so everybody can get
here
[Music]
oh good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure you've never seen a better
thing in your entire life and if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody could even understand
with their tiny human brains all you
need for that is a cup marar a glass of
tank of chin candy jger flask vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
end of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sipping it's going to
happen now go
oh well everything's perfect
now speaking of coffee there's new study
that says it's good for your
liver well should have asked me because
I could have told you coffee is good for
your whole body every single part it's
good for your your teeth your hair your
bile it's good for the things that are
just passing through coffee is there
anything I can do good for your
liver well there's a study also that
says that mentally stimulating work can
Stave off
dementia and that's why I'm here I'm
here for the medical benefits now it
would be financially possible for me to
retire and sit around doing what
potting what would I do if I were
retired this is my favorite thing I do I
mean your favorite thing intellectually
let's say um and I definitely
feel so I'll give you this as sort of a
a beacon for you who who are
younger I actually feel that at my
current age I'm the sharpest I've ever
been but not entirely meaning that I
know I learned things faster when I was
younger and maybe you know maybe a
little more creative or something I'm
not sure but maybe um but I can tell
that if you were to just compare my
ability to understand and navigate the
world today to any time earlier in my
life it's definitely better so I can
tell you at my current age I don't feel
like I'm losing I don't think I've lost
a step the energy is definitely down
definitely not not as much work all day
don't need to sleep energy but generally
speaking I'd say my mind is is right
where I'd want it to be at this age and
that has everything to do with the fact
that I uh I push it so I'm every single
day I'm doing something intellectually
that's a little bit harder than what I
can do easily so it's probably works I
recommend it last night in the man cave
I broke some brains um you may know I'm
not going to talk about free will or
argue it here because everybody's bored
with that but I'm going to tell you just
something that happened when the topic
came up in the man cave last night
that's a private live stream for the
subscribers of my Scott Adams locals
group and what I told them was they
can't learn to author the
simulation until they lose their
illusion of Free Will and people said
what how does that even make sense what
what does free will have to do with you
know managing the simulation if we are
in a simulation what's any of that even
mean how's it connected well here's how
it's
connected if you believe you have free
will you're living in an
illusion and if you're living in an
illusion you can't control your reality
because you don't know what it
is you have to understand your reality
before you can author it and Free Will
is one of our most persistent
Illusions now you might say to me but
Scott that's not making sense because if
you're authoring your environment that
that sounds a lot like having free will
so you're saying I have to say I have to
understand I don't have free
will to actually author the environment
which would be like having free will
like how does that even make sense
here's how it makes
sense when you learn you don't have free
will that becomes a p a permanent part
of the structure of your brain I think
you all understand that everything you
learn becomes a physical structure in
your brain because if it weren't
physical you wouldn't have the memory
everything you know everything you learn
everything you remember is physical it's
physically in your brain if that part of
your brain got damaged that part would
be
gone so when I if I teach you
hypothetically that Free Will is not
real that too becomes a permanent
structure in your brain and it's that
permanent structure along with some
others that are necessary to author the
simulation so another way to say it is
you'll understand it once you get there
if you do what once you understand that
Free Will isn't real then you enter a
world in which it seems like you can
control your simulation or your
environment just by what you want and
what you focus
on will that be free will it will feel
like
it you will feel like it and you will
have a better experience of
life but it won't be free will and
you'll understand that all right there's
a allegedly a Cyber attack that looks
like a pretty big one in the United
States Chuck kesto is talking about this
a number of states have a complete
failure of their 911 system right now
and there's some indication that it
might be an attack maybe a line cut or
some other kind of cyber thing does it
seem to you that that might be
Iran is it possible that's an Iranian
reaction and they're just giving us a
warning
shot maybe I don't know so we have to
suspect the worst because we've let in
so many terrorists into the country who
knows what they're up to but if I were
planning some major thing in the United
States um cutting all of our 911
services would be a really good
terrorist way to scare the hell lot of
us CU if you could imagine cutting the
911 service before a terrorist
attack that would be pretty messed up
but would also speak to State actors
because it's sort of too big of a play
for an individual
terrorist so if something happened that
looked like an Iranian terrorist attack
in the United States and if it happened
after this alleged rumors of 911 going
down that would look like a pretty
sophisticated attack which even if we
couldn't identify who did it we would
probably suspect a state actor because
of the
complexity now this is all speculation
there yeah I'm not even entirely sure
there's really a 911 problem so wait for
confirmation for any of that that's uh
that's not yet confirmed I
think well James O'Keefe of O'Keefe
Media Group has another scoop and by the
way I just want to give you a uh a
little warning that in the Dilbert
reborn comic that you can see only if
you're a subscriber on xplatform see my
profile for the link or on Scott Adams
locals.com you'd see the Dilbert reborn
comic and it will soon feature uh
Wall-E uh dating James o'keef he doesn't
know it because James o'keef will be
under
undercover but uh Wally is going to give
up too much information to James o'keef
that's coming I haven't drawn it yet but
it's coming anyway so Keef has another
scoop talk to somebody inside the Biden
Administration who believes that maybe
the real power in the administration is
the chief of staff Jeff
Zs he's a accordingly he's the second
most powerful person in Washington I
guess that would mean that Biden is the
most powerful but that Biden is
basically a puppet and says whatever Z
tells him to say
and Z used to be a Facebook board
member so everything's connected and uh
you you can't get anything done unless
you get the chief of staff sign off is
that that is that really that different
than every other
presidency isn't it generally true that
if you want to get the president to
agree with you about anything first you
have to sell the chief of
staff isn't that business as usual I I
thought that's of the job of a chief of
staff is to make sure that uh everything
goes through that person and you know
gets filtered before the president even
sees it anyway so may maybe it's much
worse under Biden it seems like it might
be but then there's also indication from
the same source that Hillary Clinton is
still deeply involved
advising and that yeah maybe she and B
and Obama still have a much bigger
influence because they have connections
to the people work in the administration
I think that's true so I would say that
this
scoop fits almost exactly what I thought
was
true which makes me worry about it a
little bit because it's a little bit too
on the nose you know didn't you assume
that there was probably one person and
maybe the chief of staff who was running
things and then maybe Obama and uh and
Hillary were you know advising from the
outside
so maybe it's exactly what it looks like
talk Carlson had a uh ex CIA guy on uh
Pedro Israel
orta he worked for the CIA during the
Trump Administration and they said that
the CIA didn't even want to recognize
him as president they didn't even want
to put his picture up in their offices
for a long
time it became controversial to even
have his picture in your
office now do you think that the CIA a
is on the same side as the
president not in that case
nope nope it doesn't look like
it it looks like the CIA has its own
agenda all right here's a story that I
I'm I'm going to laugh at this every
time I see it because you're going to
see this story in a hundred more forms
and 100 more places and every time I
laugh at what's left out here's a story
from
Politico uh
um that uh Trump is gaining with young
people and especially young men so Trump
has almost closed the Gap with young men
um and basically it's a whole story
about all the groups like uh people of
color Etc who are um moving toward Trump
but then it says that Biden still has a
strong hold among you know other groups
such as uh White women and uh black
voters um and some other group now
here's what's missing with the
story the headline is always that
they're about dead even in the National
polling you know they're within a few
points no matter depending on the
poll and yet every substory is about a
major group that's moving toward
Trump and there's never a story I
believe not one in which anybody was
moving toward Biden so look for this in
the stories the story will be this group
has massively shifted toward
Trump but they'll never mention anybody
who's moved toward
Biden and yet the total number stays the
same how is that
possible you know and at a certain point
it's possible be because if Trump is
catching up they make sense as part of
the catching up story but they've been
dead even for a long time haven't they
if they're dead even for a long time and
one of them keeps gaining in
subcategories that are really big ones
how can they stay even at the Top
Line there there's definitely something
wrong here
right am I the only one noticing that
the Top Line doesn't change when all the
bottom line changes how's that it's not
possible uh unless there's something
unreported so unless there's some group
that's moving toward
Biden that we're not being told about
and I don't think that's the case do you
have you heard of any story of any
demographic moving toward Biden I've
only heard that he has a commanding lead
in some group or another but I've never
heard that they're increasing the
lead yeah there's something very wrong
with everything we're being told about
these numbers
something very wrong very
suspicious well here's the weirdest
story I don't even know what to think
about this but Jim Brewer was on uh
Roseanne's podcast and Jim Brewer had
worked with Dave Chappelle at one point
and here's what he says this is what Jim
Brewer says so we all know the story
about Dave Chappelle had his popular TV
show and then he instead of taking a big
offer to renew it he just disappeared Ed
and went to Africa for a while and
everybody said what's wrong with him is
he crazy what's going on and Jim Brewer
says
that uh that Dave Chappelle told him in
private that an elite group of people
came to him and sat him down to quote
correct him and that that was a phrase
used to correct
him and and then he suddenly went to he
vanished and went to
Africa and that when he came back he was
different do you do you think that an
elite group of
people sat him down to talk to him and
correct him and that that was so such a
dangerous situation that he had to leave
the
country how many of you believe that's
true I don't believe that's
true yeah I'm going to say no on this
one yeah I won't I will say it's
impossible but until you hear it from uh
Chappelle you should probably treat it
like it's not true if Chappelle says it
I'm definitely going to pay attention
now you should now obviously if this is
true he wouldn't say it right because
the whole story is he he would never
tell you because it's too dangerous
whatever it is whoever this group is and
whatever it is they wanted but does
anybody even have a theory for why
anybody would have wanted to stop Dave
Chappelle what what the hell was Dave
Chappelle saying that was so dangerous
or what was he doing that was so
dangerous was he outing anybody did he
was he outing a ped ring
or was there anything he did that was
controversial that I'm not aware of
it so I'm going to say I don't believe
that
story that'll be my take that's my
current take I give it a 7525
75% chance no 25% chance maybe there's
something there but I don't know who
that Elite group is for sure all
right uh on the xplatform Christopher
Frant tells us that uh it looks like mid
Journey the AI program that does movie
like um Clips may have scraped images
from major TV film and streaming Studios
and then some examples were shown where
it looks like AI is creating images that
appear to be clearly cribbed from real
movies and TV you maybe changed a little
bit but clearly came from that
inspiration to which I say what did we
think was
happening how else would it train if
you're training a thing to know how to
make a movie you know the way that
people would expect a movie to look what
did you think they were trading it on do
you think they were trading it to make
movies by showing it
people that wouldn't teach you how to
make a movie you would have to look at
movies of course it looked at
Movies how in the world do you think it
didn't but isn't that exactly how a
human director works a human writer a
human Movie Maker can't do the job
without looking at a whole bunch of
movies first his movies are formulaic
even the scenes even the visuals are
formula right there are only so many
angles that you shoot you can shoot as
seen and once you've seen them that's
all there is so there isn't any other
way you could have trained AI to make a
movie other than making it look at
movies but the real question is if it
looks at a movie and then tweaks it
enough isn't that new
art so let's say it looks at a movie
scene where it was blocked down a
certain way it's like oh there's a
tracking scene and it shows the star
walking through a crowd and then the
then the tracking shot goes from above
so you know you could
imagine that it would use the same let's
say schemes and techniques but change
the characters and change the movie and
change the lighting and everything it
would be it would be a new
scene so um but this is part of a larger
topic which I like to bring up which is
if anything can stop AI it'll be
lawyers because lawyers are just going
to be all over AI in fact the only way
that AI could survive in my opinion
is that it was created by a company that
became so big so quickly it would have
infinite assets to to fight the legal
battles if you were a startup in your
garage you let's say Brian relli comes
up with his own AI
model it wouldn't be hard to stop
Brian you just one person all you need
to do too is law fair am man of business
and you know he would give up but you
can't really law fair am a business a
mult multi-billion dollar company so if
AI had not become somewhat instantly a
multi-billion dollar asset it would been
killed in his crib by lawyers but at
this point it's bigger than
lawyers uh it's sort of the Uber method
the Uber um shouldn't have been able to
work because it couldn't really compete
with taxis because it was illegal it was
just against the law but they became so
big so fast that the lawyers didn't have
time to like catch what was going on and
then they had so much money that they
could fight lawyers and beat them
because they had more money and more
lawyers so look for that situation there
there's some businesses that you just
can't do if you start small you almost
have to start big that's what Uber and
and AI both did they started big all
right so keep an eye on that there more
science that says that hugging can ease
your pain anxiety and depression U let's
add to the science that you could have
skipped by asking
Scott Scott we were thinking of putting
a whole bunch of money into studying
hugging to see if it makes you feel
better well you don't have to do that
because I could tell you it definitely
does oh thank you you just saved us a
lot of money Scott so really if you were
to compare um the entire field of
science to just asking me for my opinion
it'd be about a wash
I don't get them all right but neither
does science science is about a 50%
proposition at best you know papers that
are peer reviewed and accepted are only
right about 50% of the time how often am
I right well on most of the lifestyle
stuff I'm right almost every time almost
every time for example will there be a
study coming up that shows our food
supply is not healthy for you yes there
will even today there was another study
showing that there's all too many things
in your food supply do you think I could
have told you that yes I could have 100%
right do you think they find out that
alcohol is bad for you in any amount yes
and I could have told you that because I
did 20 years ago so yeah hugs are good
for you
surprise all right again the funniest
story which I'm going to keep telling
you about even if you don't like it is
bri. and his new orifice AI device now
it's a
sextoy and the funny part is what the
the public is responding to so it's
becoming sort of a you know a public
least onx a uh public battle where
people are so mad about uh trying to you
know being living in a world where men
would be using these devices now here's
what's hilarious I forgot that the name
of the product is
orifice he actually named the product
orifice and it's
a and it's a partial replacement for
women like human women it's just called
orifice and here's the funny part it's
so
insulting it's so amazingly
insulting that he's building a company
to replace some portion of human women
with a
hole now I'm not saying that's a fair
characterization all right so I'm not
giving you my opinion on women here that
has nothing to do with this conversation
I'm just saying what could be funnier
than launching a product to replace much
of human women with a
hole and then you name it you name the
product after the
whole or a
this you at least at least when women
make a Sex to
toy yeah the most popular sex toy for
women is called the
womanizer the
womanizer sounds like it was created
possibly by woman or at least women were
involved in the marketing and naming of
it because there it's like woman yeah
womanizer yes go ladies you don't need
men
that when they're replacing men they're
like yeah go ladies go ladies you don't
need men you can do it yourself with a
womanizer yeah you're more woman than
you've ever been you're womanizing now
but but then when a man creates a sex
story it's a
[Laughter]
hole I'm could to be laughing all day
about this anyway so if you're if you're
wondering can somebody replace human
women at least in terms of men's sexual
appetites uh how many human women can be
replaced by a
hole and I'd say about 40% already and
and
raising and here's here's the funniest
one there some angry woman I saw this
the other day there was an angry woman
who was attacking bri. a uh for his
product the
orifice and uh just gave him a whole
bunch of trouble for it and and uh he
saying he was basically going to replace
women and bride. ai's response
was and I
quote you should have been nicer to me
in high
school so he invented a replacement for
women it's called the
hole or
orice all
right I'm
I I'm just saying the whole thing is so
funny because it's so offensive
intentionally that people aren't
catching on that it's intentionally
offensive so so they're reacting they're
reacting as though they don't know that
they're the
marketing anyway ESPN's uh uh stepen is
it Stefan I never know is it Stefan
asith is he a Stefan or a
Steven that name always confuses me it
can go either way right
Stefan I don't know so Stefan or Steven
A Smith um says that the the people
going after Trump with lawfare are a
bunch of cowards and that all you're
doing is showing that you're scared you
can't beat him on the
issues everything you do shows me you
can't beat
him he says it's giving fodder to the
argument that the election is
rigged Ste I'm being told it's Steven
so we'll say Stephen A
Smith so he's he's completely
right he's completely right I if your
argument is that that the elections were
not rigged then trying to rig it with
lawfare right in front of the entire
world while you're arguing that the
election wasn't rigged but you're
rigging it right now I mean Legally
Legally because the law fair stuff is
not itself illegal he should be because
it's being used illegally but probably
won't be you know actually prosecuted in
anyway but uh yes he's completely right
if you're going to rig the election
right in front of the entire
Republic everybody can see it we all
know that the law fair is about the
election it's not about anybody having
broken any laws that anybody cares about
nobody cares about stormmy nobody nobody
cares about his phone
call nobody cares about the loans he
made to banks that were very happy to do
business with him nobody cares about any
of it nobody cares about his documents
at Mar Lago not really I mean not real
people nobody really cares so it's
obvious that it's all political and uh
yeah he's right but here's what I I
would have to say about Stephen A Smith
and I apologize to him for getting his
name uh inaccurate at first um that's
what a leader looks like
I I always say that uh Black America
doesn't have a
leader now they do have you know people
who are prominent but they're really not
good at it you know they're not good at
it like Obama's good at it and Obama's
you know sort of in the sidelines lover
hate
Obama he was real good at the leadership
stuff right you don't have to like where
he led but leader definitely a leader
and I would say this Stephen A Smith has
that leadership thing I'm not and it
feels like he he is suffering from the
Spider-Man
curse you know the Spider-Man curse uh
with great power comes great
responsibility I can't read mins but
when I see somebody as capable as
Stephen A Smith and when I hear him
talking the way he's talking about the
big issues it feels like he just
realized that he's the one who knows how
to do it he actually knows how to show
leadership so he's modeling it
it's actually very impressive so if he
if he someday runs for
office um and don't fool yourself I
don't think he's a trump Republican is
he he's just showing you that he can see
the whole Court which is really rare and
then having seen the whole Court he
tells you what to do about it that makes
sense also very rare very rare so yeah
he's got the real deal if he ever ran
for office I would definitely like
chances I would like his chances if he
ran for office that doesn't mean I'm
going to agree with him on policy but
wow he's capable anyway I like to see
capable people do
well Tim Po tells us that his timcast
IRL show um three of his older shows
from three years ago just got uh strikes
against them there were shows with
Michael malis Joe Rogan and real Alex
Jones now do you think that that's about
something Tim kcast did or they're just
trying to suppress those three other
people now we know that they've you know
there's been some move to suppress you
know Pro Trump voices but I'm wondering
is this a move mostly against
timcast because I'm trying to think is
timcast the last um serious independent
voice that hasn't been taken down by the
bad
guys it it seems to me like the um it
would be obvious that Tim would get
targeted by the bad guys to be taken
down for some you know lawfare or social
media reason or some hoax or get
cancelled or something I would imagine
that there's like a whole team of people
working on just putting Tim pool on a
business do you think that's true do you
think there's an actual team like
professionals being paid by somebody to
look at ways to put them out of
business I think yes yeah I think yes
there are people who's who who are paid
from somebody could be the CIA could be
just Democrats um to put them out of
business that's what it looks
like so here's another story uh there's
I guess Dubai has been doing some cloud
seeding and maybe they went overboard
and caused a bunch of
flooding do you think they can actually
uh geoengineer the atmosphere and Make
It Rain where they wanted
to I don't know I have mixed feelings
about
it on one hand I think it's inevitable
we'll definitely be managing the
atmosphere eventually and the other hand
I think maybe we're not ready so we
might you know destroy the world trying
to make it
better so I think it's going to happen
it has to happen it's
inevitable um but it's dangerous
so we'll keep an eye on that zubie is
talking about the Obesity
rates uh on aent he gave that little
chart of what the Obesity was let me let
me show you the rate so this is from
1975 to uh current and then projected so
1975 there was a 12% us adult obesity
rate 12% you've seen all those old
pictures of people in New York City in
the 30s or whatever it is and it looks
like 100% of them are
thin
um but 12% by 1975 that sounds about
right you know I was there that feels
about right 12% 1985 it was 15 not much
difference so in 10 years a little bit
of creeped up crept up by 1998 it was up
to 25 2020 2014 it was up to 35 and by
this year it's up to
42% adult obesity
42% and it's projected by that by 2031
it will reach
50% now I'm here to tell you it's much
worse than
that because it's not evenly
distributed there are states and regions
where the obesity rate is really close
to
100% I remember visiting um the facility
where my ailing father was you know on
his uh on his last uh weeks of life and
it was a medical facility you know and
uh I remember sit in his room for hours
because I went to visit it wasn't much
to do because he was mostly just you
know sleeping at that time and I would
just watch the people walk by in the
hallway and I started to notice say wow
there's some you know big people that
work here and then I said to myself what
was the last time I saw somebody wasn't
gigantic and and I just sat there and
watched people walk by his room in the
hallway and I just said obese or not
obese they're all obese all of them
Upstate New York every one of them was
obese I think there were a few you know
maybe 18 year olds who weren't you know
some people had you know part-time jobs
and stuff but every adult over
30 was a big old Barrel siiz person so
if you go to La for example if you're in
the Hollywood area
you'll you won't see the
Obesity if you go to New York City and
walk down the street in Manhattan not a
not a ton of obesity if you fly in an
airplane you know you always hear the
complaints about the the big person in
the seat next to you but it's kind of
rare uh beyond beyond a certain size
people just don't fly I mean they do so
hear the story but it's rare uh so
airports are
more thin people than large there are
some cities that are more thin people
and if you take them out of the mix out
of the
average um yeah your your obesity is
probably 75% below a certain income
level now it's also related to income I
would bet that
below below $100,000 a year I'll bet
it's close to 75%
OBC that's my
guess um anyway
so did you know that one of the most
influential people in American politics
is an 88-year-old Swiss
guy that's something I learned today you
know we all hear about George Soros
putting so much money into things and
influence them well apparently there's
like a George Soros Jr whose name I
never heard uh hun joro whis 88 and he's
a this billionaire who's been putting in
hundreds of of millions of dollars into
American stuff similar to the Soros kind
of activities and to the point where
he's one of the most important people in
the country he's not even in the country
he's a Swiss guy so the GOP is trying to
crack down in this loophole that lets
foreign donors put all this what they
call the dark money into US
elections anybody who thought our
elections are determined by the will of
the people do you feel silly
that you ever believe that it's this is
the stuff there there are like 15 to 20
effects that determine completely who
gets to become president and what the
law is and none of them are the will of
the people it's all just different stuff
it's just money and lawfare and you know
how they rig the system rig meaning the
the laws about how to
vote yeah yeah we haven't lived in
anything like a republic in a maybe ever
I don't know
Delta Airlines is eliminating uh college
degree requirements for all positions
including
Pilots well you know there's nothing
that makes me want to fly an airplane
more than knowing that they've lowered
the standards for the
pilots now on one hand I do agree that
you should just pick good people whether
they have a college degree or not but I
do think it's a
rather useful to have that standard it
it does it does reduce the number of
people who are you know not qualified
from slipping
through so I would say that's not a good
sign for
America every time we lower a
standard uh it's always for some good
reason to increase diversity or
something but I don't think we get
enough benefit for what it costs
generally
speaking so you heard the story about
those 28 Google employees who who
occupied a SE uh one of the Executive
offices and they were mad because Israel
was still um the Google was still doing
business with the Israeli
government and what did Google do it
fired all of them so it fired all of
them now are you
surprised because you think oh Google is
so liberal and blah blah blah
well um I wouldn't be surprised no I
think Google just did what every would
do in that
situation so they violated their
internal standards and that was good
enough to fire them so good for Google I
don't think that it uh it fixed anything
because Google app apparently is
completely
rotted um their employees are rotted
from the inside they're all they're all
woke um mentally ill people for the most
part speaking of that the uh NPR
CEO uh Ms Mar marah
um we find out more about her apparently
she was a member of the Atlantic Council
and the
WF and she gave a speech at the Carnegie
endowment that's a group now if you've
been following Mike Ben you would know
that at least the Atlantic Council and
the carnegi analment are just straight
up CIA
entities basically they're just
intelligence entities so it would seem
that Miss Mah is very deeply embedded
with the intelligence part of the world
and she was in charge of uh Wikipedia so
she was the head of you know all
knowledge for
Wikipedia and then the head of
NPR and so the person who is in charge
of telling us what's
Real uh is a basically CIA
adjacent so just like you think but
she's getting some uh some push back
from well what what do these three
people have in common Gad sad Elon Musk
and V ramaswami so all three of them are
criticizing NPR CEO Mar uh what do those
three have in
common three of the smartest people in
the world at least in terms of politics
and philosophy and stuff right so if all
three of them are you know piling on you
know plus Chris rufo a lot of smart
people right so the smart people have
taken the following
stand because in a speech I guess it was
to the Carnegie endowment uh nprc CEO
said that she believes that truth is
subjective um or or a distraction from
the pursuit or from getting things
done that the truth is subjective and
and a
distraction and I'm paraphrasing a
little bit but this is pretty close uh
and the and it can get in the way of the
pursuit of truth I'm sorry The Pursuit
Of Truth can get in the way of getting
things done so Gad sad said uh quote
truth is
subjective uh unquote is precisely the
key tenant of
postmodernism this is why I refer to it
as the granddaddy of all parasitic idea
pathogens well that's a lot of smart
words in one sentence
theread I I will have to hire somebody
to explain to me in my sixth grade world
what that means I think I understand all
right Elon mus
said now imagine if this is programmed
explicitly or implicitly into super
powerful AI it could end
civilization and he says now no need to
imagine it is already programmed into
Google Gemini and open AI chat
GPT so that would be talking about the
idea that truth is subjective and it can
get in the way of getting things
done
V along the same
lines said that
uh um he qued to the CEO CEO of NPR
saying quote our reverence for the truth
might be a distraction getting in the
way of finding common ground and getting
things
done and says this gets to the heart of
the cultural divide in the modern West
whether you believe truth is a priority
or a
hindrance do you agree with all three of
these people Gad sad El mus
and that this this uh downgrading of
Truth in favor of getting stuff
done is the
problem and that it's a basically an
existential problem if you throw a AI in
the mix everybody agree with that all
right I just agree with all three of
them
vigorously as hard as I can she's
completely
right and you see it every
day yeah let me give you an
example
abortion abortion take the abortion
thing we have uh different opinions
which cannot be reconciled do you know
why they can't be
reconciled because we'll never agree on
what's true
is it true that it's murder or is that
not true or killing killing a human I
guess not
murder and so the argument is over
what's true is it true that you're
taking a human
life now that can't be
solved would you would you agree that
can't be solved in
realistically realistically one of those
is right you think and one of them is
wrong you think
and but it can't be
solved so what do you do when you have a
problem that can't be
solved you make do you do what you can
do so what do we do as a nation when we
can't decide what's
true we
compromise and we we just work it out we
just find some Middle Ground where where
the people who don't get what they want
are not willing to Stage a
revolution that's a perfect example what
she's saying we're not going to agree
what's true but if we stop there we'd
never get anything done because we do
have to kind of move past let's say
abortion and I would say that's just an
example I would say every one of our big
issues have the same same issue what's
true we don't agree on and never will so
if you allowed yourself to never try to
fix anything until you found out what's
true you would never fix anything she's
completely right it is 100% true that if
you think that you know the truth and
the other people don't you're probably
part of the problem you might be right
but you could also be part of the
problem if you insist that the other
people agree with you before you can
move
forward in the real world people don't
agree what true but often we can find a
way to work
together right so so um she's 100% right
um reality is completely subjective how
many of you believe that Free Will is
real and how many of you believe it's
not how are you ever going to solve that
one of the most basic questions of your
reality is Free Will real we're never
going to agree with that but can we find
a way to move on yes we can but uh I
don't believe in Free Will and some of
you do
so what would we do about the legal
system if you know if you if you took my
point of view there's no free will how
would you punish anybody how would you
have a how would you have a justice
system if nobody's really responsible
for anything well I'll tell you how um
since I believe there's no free will but
I also need to move forward somehow I
mean I need to live in the real world I
say all right I agree with you you can't
really build a system unless you punish
people
so I accept a system where people who
really couldn't help what they did are
punished right because I can't think of
a better way so there's a perfect
example where we'll never agree what's
true free will or no free will but we
can figure out a way to make the world
work and I think I could come up with a
hundred different examples where she's
completely right we'll never agree
what's true but we can figure out how to
take a step forward
so here's your real problem your real
problem is that you don't agree with her
about what's true that's the real
problem the real problem is not that she
understands the truth is what we imagin
it is she's 100% right about that the
the part that you don't like is that her
truth is different from
yours if she said everything you agreed
with and then said truth is subjective
we have to figure out a way forward you
wouldn't have a problem with it you
wouldn't suppos she said uh well you
know we we know the truth is that these
fetuses are real life humans and that
killing them is immoral that's our truth
but we have to move forward somehow so
we're going to compromise with the
people who disagree with what's
true that framing would make you okay
with it so what's really the problem is
you don't like her opinions
not that she thinks opinions are
subjective so do I think she's part of
the problem
yes yeah she's a big part of the problem
she she is not just specifically part of
the problem but she represents as a
number of people say were saying today
on X she represents a whole infection of
people who have a certain point of view
which I find
destructive right but the fact that I
find it destructive and I think that's
true does that matter nope what will
matter is who wins the election and you
know who has power that will matter so
I'm working on who wins the election and
who has power because I can't change
what's true to somebody
else all
right um this is why you watch my show
by the way I remind you that these
uncomfortable things where I'm
completely on the other side from you
that's why you watch because you're not
going to see it anywhere else I mean if
you get a steady stream of uh
Republicans are awesome you're not
getting smarter you need somebody to to
tell you when your side is getting off
the track a little bit right that's the
useful thing the useful thing is finding
out when your own team is wrong because
you always think the other team's
wrong all right um all let me here's the
story um I just read that Florida is
banned a bunch of
books it was in the news is it
true you tell me is it a true story that
Florida banned um I know a few thousand
books true no it's not true no that's
not
true NOP it's in the
news but what is true is that they um
they removed them from from where
children can see
them there's no there are no banned
books for adults in Florida that's not a
thing there are no ban books in
Florida but both of these are treated as
the
truth so NPR CEO is completely right you
can disagree whether there's a book ban
in Florida I say there's not other
people say there is but can we despite
having a different understanding of
what's real figure out how to go forward
yeah
yeah disantis just um you has laws
apparently can move those books to the
non-child library places and then
everybody's fine so yeah you don't need
to know what true you just need to know
how to handle it speaking of what's
true Joe Biden has a new story about his
uncle being eaten by
cannibals which apparently does not pass
the fact checking according to Jonathan
Turley but apparently he was in
Pittsburgh doing some campaign stuff he
told the story of how uh his uncle boie
in World War II uh was uh let's see he
was a hell of an athlete some for some
reason you need to know he was a hell of
an athlete um and then he he flew those
single engine planes it turns out he
didn't fly he he wasn't a flyer he
wasn't a pilot and the plane he was in
was not a single engine Jonathan trly uh
looked into that and he was over a war
zone and I guess it it actually went
down for mechanical problems it wasn't
shot down as Biden says and they never
found the body because there there used
to be there were a lot of cannibals for
real and that part of New
Guinea so he's saying that they never
found the body so that you know maybe
the cannibals got
him but there was a member of the crew
who did survive and the member of the
crew who did survive said watched the
other crew members not being able to get
out of the plane as it went into the
water so no the cannibals did not eat
his
uncle his uncle was a really good
athlete who couldn't get out of an
airplane that crashed in the
water
so so do we need to know the truth about
his uncle who was or was not eaten by
cannibals no we don't the truth is
completely irrelevant because you know
it's just campaign talk and it doesn't
matter anyway so no the truth doesn't
matter doesn't matter a bit on that
story well the K the Kennedy family
apparently many members will appear in a
big group uh with Biden to endorse him
and which basically is a slap in the
face to their family member RFK Jr who
is running against
Biden you know who wishes their
relatives had been eaten by
cannibals RFK Jr but not only that if
cannibals ate his
relatives uh they would be eating a
better diet than the American diet am I
right better diet than the American diet
at least it' be good protein no
additives so no I'm not recommending
that cannibals eat the Kennedy family
but if they did they'd be healthier than
the normal fast food
diet um I would like to uh give a shout
out to my family my remaining family
members uh I won't name them but I sure
appreciate my
family do you know what my family would
never do they would never do
this if I ran for president my my you
know I have a very small family group
left but my family members never would
have gathered together to endorse the
other guy you know they might might have
sat it out they might have said no
comment if they thought the other guy
was the the good one for to be president
but
no they would not have traveled to
Washington to to stand with the
competitor and endorse
him I hate to tell you R okay but your
family sucks your family
sucks like this is the minimum the
minimum requirement for your family not
to suck is to endorse the other guy in
an election it's not like RF junior is a
criminal it's not like he has bad
intentions for the country it's not like
his policies are some crazy
 he's a genuine
legitimate serious person with a serious
resume running against a brain dead
piece of to try to save the country
and try to save you all you Kennedy
children from eating that's killing
you and putting stuff in your body that
you shouldn't be putting in your body
and that's why you want the other guy to
win he he's just trying to save
children I mean he could be wrong about
some stuff mean there would be no no
real shame in that because everybody's
wrong about stuff but really your
family is going to throw you under the
bus in
public in this
situation I'll just say it straight out
I I really like RFK Jr I think he's
great for the country you know win or
win or lose I think he's great for the
country but the these family members
suck I mean they just suck there's just
no way around it this is just terrible
family
Behavior speaking of RFK Jr you saying
again unambiguously on another podcast
uh that uh the CIA is guilty of
murdering his uncle JFK he says the
evidence is so abundant and so
definitive um that if he took the case
to a jury he would win in front of
almost any
jury and he says it's because JFK defied
the military industrial complex they
wanted to you know attack Cuba and JFK
didn't and they didn't like him ending
the war in Vietnam which he also tried
to
do so that all does make sense to
me you know the the Kennedy
assassination the official story was
always a little sketchy
right from the beginning you're like
really I don't know it seems a little
sketchy there was some mighty good
shooting from that guy from that
upstairs I don't know did he really care
that one guy he cared so much that he
did that I don't know never really
totally made sense but this does uh
every part of the the CIA killed him
makes sense to me now I don't know
what's true and what isn't but every
part of the story makes sense it all
fits together perfectly and it matches
everything we know about
everything all right
um so I don't see how those same people
can allow RFK Jr to become president so
he is in Mortal danger you know there is
a scenario in which RFK Jr becomes
president uh let me just say it out loud
if the CIA takes out
Trump and then Biden collapses just from
natural
causes RFK JR could be the next
president in fact I'd give him at least
a one-third chance I think the odds are
one3 13 13d at the moment it has nothing
to do with polling has everything to do
with the outside sources I think the
odds of uh Biden simply
surviving and the election is rigged and
he wins in a rigged election is about
one out of three I think the odds of uh
Trump surviving any assassination
attempts and also getting a big enough
victory that they can't cheat their way
to through it one and three no matter
what the polling says one and three are
best and the odds of RFK Jr making it
all the way to presidency is about one
in three also because I think the odds
of Biden collapsing are pretty good and
I think the odds of the CIA taking Trump
out if it with lawfare or something
worse is pretty good good as in bad
so I my my current estimate is they each
have a one and three chance of being
president and none of it has to do with
the will of the people let me say it
again they each have a one and three
chance and none of it has to do with
voters because we don't live in that
system anymore if we ever did it will be
entirely determined by the capability uh
of the people in the back rooms and the
health of the current president and
that's probably all that will matter
if the people in the back rooms do a
good job well they get everything they
want it's probably
Biden all
right um there are a whole bunch of new
sanctions being put on Iran because of
the attack on Israel um Let me let me
mention the sanctions because there a
whole bunch of them there's the uh the
the vague one there's the the one I
don't know about there's a well there's
a complicated one there's a well there's
one that
seems to not really affect anything but
maybe a couple of guys there's a one
that I don't know it looks like it could
make some difference but I don't really
understand it there's one that okay they
don't even tell you what they
are do you believe that we have an
infinite number of sanctions that we can
whip out anytime we
want is that the way it works it it's
not like there are three sanctions that
can make a difference and then there are
a million sanctions that you could do
but they're not really going to make a
difference I feel like it's more of that
don't you like there's a strong 8020
situation that might be like a
991 where there might be a few sanctions
that if you could get them to stick
would really move the needle and then
there's probably a whole bunch of other
ones where some rich guy goes wa you
mean I can't dock My Yacht at Washington
DC well I'll just dock is somewhere else
is that okay that's perfectly okay
okay okay I guess I got
sanctioned you know I I feel like the
sanctions are just because if
they weren't they would tell us what
they were and they would tell us whether
they could make any difference but no
the news just says oh lots of sanctions
more sanctions oh I'll put some more
sanctions on how about we put some
sanctions on I you should reelect me
because of all my sanctions I put on 50
53 sanctions if if 50 three sanctions is
not enough I could put on 50 more that
will be unspecified and vague and you
couldn't even tell if they make a
difference but if if a 100 sanctions
isn't enough I could put 200 sanctions
on I could put 300 sanctions on I'll put
more sanctions
on that's the state of your
news uh Biden tells Israel not to attack
Israel
sounds like I'm making that
up but uh he said quote I made it clear
to Israelis don't move on
hia H would be a a city in
Israel yeah
H what do you mean
Rafa actually um I don't think the the
misspeaking is as big a deal as others
do uh I don't think that's really the
the big sign he losing it because I
think maybe he always did that and Trump
misspeaks and I misspeak and you know I
I misspeak twice a day I don't I don't
think that's the biggest thing but
they're funny stories Babylon B reports
that Biden campaign has a new slogan you
know they tried a number of things build
back better no Malarkey none of those
really none of them really felt like
they captur the spirit of what's going
on but as the Babylon B reports the new
SL seems to really capture it perfectly
the new slogan is death to
America if you're not familiar The
Babylon B is a satirical news outfit and
what I mean by satirical and what I mean
by parody is it looks exactly like the
real news no real
difference all right um uh there's a
story that a prosecutor in California
the California da uh dropped this uh
so-called bombshell election data case
because it might help
Trump so there's some whistleblower so
apparently there was some case about
somebody involved with the electronic
part of the
elections had sent some data over to
China some American election data sent
it to servers in China now I don't know
all the details of that story but the
reporting is that the only reason they
didn't prosecute is because it would
have made a story for Trump to talk
about
politically
maybe uh I'm willing to believe that CBS
News is reporting that some members of
Congress who led the investigation the
the January 6 uh committee people that
uh they've already told their family
they've talked to their families about
their safety and the risk of their
arrest if Trump wins the second term do
you think the January 6 commit
is at risk of imprisonment if Trump wins
the second term do you think they risk
of imprisonment for investigating him
the way they
did yes every one of them belongs in
prison and it's really
obvious really obvious you want some
evidence
Well turns out came to the right place
here's some evidence that the January 6
people belong in jail
there is a National Guard Captain who's
testifying to Congress and he says quote
I can say unequivocably that the
inspector General's
review that's the review of January 6
and all that stuff is riddled with
inaccuracies misstatements and perhaps
false flags and narratives regarding how
critical Pentagon senior officials
responded when our Republic was under
great
stress so his claim is that the um
president of the United States had
pre-authorized the deployment of 10,000
National Guard troops just in case
things got in a hand now do you remember
any part of the January 6 um proceedings
in which the public was informed that
the person they said was trying to
conquer the country had been in
certainly
verifiably um documented no question
about it had tried to get 10,000
National Guard people there to prevent
any kind of
violence now that's true Beyond any
doubt I
think and that would make the entire
January 6 narrative that Trump was
trying to conquer the country look
ridiculous because he' authorized 10,000
people to
prevent something happening at the
capital do you know why those 10,000
were not sent
in the
end well according to the Whistleblower
is because the uh Pentagon uh delayed
dispatching them over the concerns for
the
Optics the Optics what do you think
would be the concern for the
Optics now it doesn't matter what they
were thinking does it it doesn't matter
if they were thinking something that was
good for the country or bad for the
country what matters is the military is
the one who left the government
unprotected let me say it
again the US military intentionally and
fully understanding the
danger decided at the management level
to leave the members of Congress
unprotected
now smart people say the only reason you
would do that is to make a case against
Trump
no I'm not sure that's the only reason
because you know regular incompetence
and miscommunication and stupidity and
you know it's a complicated
world but it certainly
tracks like it fits the facts I don't
know if it's true but it fits the
facts that the the military was part of
a larger operation to make sure that
Trump was uh squashed forever and
couldn't come
back but whether or not the the military
was thinking um of a way to protect the
republic or to just get Trump that is
irrelevant to the fact that we have
conclusive multiple Witnesses and
documentation that President Trump was
trying to protect the capital and he was
prevented from doing that by his own
military which is called
what an
Insurrection what what it called when
the military refuses an order from the
commander-in-chief because doing the
order would be good for the country and
the
commander-in-chief I don't know to me it
looks like a coup looks like treason so
to me it looks like the January 6
committee was covering up their own
coup and that they should that they're
guilty of
insurrection and that it would be easy
to prove because all you have to do is
prove that the people who knew they
could be protected chose the other path
and then they sold that other path as
Trump's fault when it was 100% their own
doing if if there's no crime in that
then you might as well just open the
jails it's the most criminal act that
I've seen since that video of the Dead
Guy at the bank have yall seen that I
think it was in Brazil or somewhere
somebody wheeled a dead guy into a bank
and pretended he was just sleepy to try
to get him to sign a loan
put the pen in his hand
and holding up the hat that that is the
guy's just dead he's literally just
dead and he's sitting in front of the
banker and it makes you wonder what the
banker is
thinking should I check if he's alive
because he looks
dead and he must have been fresh because
he didn't have rigor mortise like he
must have died within like an hour
before he got to the bank CU he was
still his head still was FL
around so that was pretty terrible
anyway not as terrible as the January
6th stuff so yes I believe that if Trump
gets an office there's probably a whole
bunch of people who need to go to jail
over
Ukraine and the
pandemic in January
6 not to mention whatever we might find
out about elections
themselves so and and I think it has to
happen you know uh you could imagine a
time when I would have said you know I
don't think that the President should
throw in jail the other team because
it's a bad
look not if they do
this if the reason you're throwing them
in jail is that they tried to throw you
in jail on madeup charges then yes if
you win you can put them all in jail I I
think that has to be the the rule in
fact we should we should encourage that
not discourage it if if the thing you're
putting your opponent in jail for is
that they tried to put you in jail for
nothing and got
caught
absolutely they all belong in jail every
one of
them so I'm I'm down for that and if
that uh if that destroys the country and
creates massive riots I'm down for that
I'm down for that yeah if if uh all of
like business shut down for months
because it was wild um uh let's say
protests in the street and violence and
and Le let's say even hundreds of people
got
killed I'm down for that yeah I don't
want anybody to K get killed and I'm
against violence of all kinds but if you
ask me would that be the right play to
put them all in jail even at the risk of
massive disruption to the economy
massive disruption to Life as we know it
yes that's totally worth it because the
alternative is much worse much
worse all
right uh Colonel accuses senior officers
blatantly lying to Congress about
yeah
um yep I think Mark
Millie I think Mark Millie is got a lot
of explaining to do all right ladies and
Gent gentlemen that's all I've got for
you today I'm going to say bye to the
