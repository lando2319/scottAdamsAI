to do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams I
can guarantee that Today's Show will not
be woke it will not be woke
because I only had about three hours
sleep so I'm definitely not awake
so I'm sort of like dog bird today
I'll show you a picture of dogbert you
cannot see this unless you're on the
locals platform
but here's the third panel of a
Dilbert's trip
dogbert has asked are you woke and
dogberg says I was until you bored me
well might be a little of that today
you know if you'd like to enjoy the show
at the maximum potential all you need is
uh
cup or a mug or a glass a tanker Chelsea
style the canteen Dragon flaska Festival
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
let's see if this is enough to take us
up to
unprecedented levels unprecedented
well let's check the news
in North Carolina a Democrat became a
Republican
because the Democrats are bullies
and if you want to be problem
solution driven
you cannot be a Democrat according to
somebody whose name I didn't write down
who Trisha I don't know but somebody in
North Carolina became a
are you getting the feeling that the
news is repetitive and boring today
do you think I would have started with
that story if anything interesting was
happening today can we just agree that
none of the news is interesting today
and just none of it is interesting
but we'll do the best we can with our
time here together
yep
well there's a story in Vanity Fair that
Don Lemon is a huge misogynistic jerk
and has been for years
yeah that's pretty much the whole story
I could give you lots of anecdotes but
misogynistic jerk kind of covers
everything doesn't it yep misogynistic
jerk
well that's too bad
[Laughter]
I don't care about that story either
Alice say a Democrat became a republican
Don lemon's a jerk all right these are
the big stories ladies and gentlemen
it does not get any more important than
this
all right here's a repeat story
I think all the news people just went on
vacation or is it because Trump didn't
do anything
Trump doesn't do anything there's no
news
so NPR is pushing back on Twitter for
their big labeled state-affiliated media
and their argument is that they only get
one percent of their funding from the
federal government
now first of all does that even sound
true
why would they get one percent of their
funding from the government
if they're down to one percent shouldn't
it be zero
I mean seriously
what what does that one percent do
they should drop it to zero and then
have no government interference at all
but the state-sponsored
um affiliate State affiliate label
that's not not just because of funding
so it's also if you're in the bag for
the the government would you say that
funding aside
would you say that NPR is just an organ
of the Democrats
and the Democrats are in charge so it's
basically just government-affiliated
media yeah to me it looks like
state-affiliated media because there is
no possibility
that NPR would ever run a republican
friendly article would they
and if they're not going to run anything
that's Republican friendly and the
government is you know sort of democrat
dominated at the moment
I'd say they're state-affiliated media I
think that actually fits what I don't
know is why NBC doesn't have that label
so it makes sense that NPR does I just
don't understand why nobody else has it
um Julie Kelly is tweeting
that there's a new bombshell report
about January 6.
that there were over 40 undercover
people
there were over 40 undercover people not
all FBI though
apparently there were some other
government entities
such as the I don't know
some kind of Homeland Security thing but
40 Undercover
people
who apparently were just observing
some were D.C police
um I feel like I'm going to pass out any
moment now if I pass out
it's because I'm trying too hard to
speak
and I'm getting dizzy
but I I actually bypass out in a minute
that's I'm actually serious about that
um
here's my only good thought for the day
you ready for this
NPR I'm sorry
oh my God I'm tired uh I called it AI
NPR AI
uh
if we train AI not to hurt people
which we probably will right
we'll probably have something like the
robotic law
Highlands robotic law
and
Evan's going to say don't hurt people
that's going to make it oh it's I'm
sorry it's Asimov Isaac Asimov Isaac
asimov's oh my God what a this is just a
train wreck today
should I just go back to bed just forget
this whole thing
it really looks like I should
I've got a stream of yeses people are
saying just give up just just just call
it a day
all right I'm going to make one good
point
and if I make this good point
then that should be my signal to
continue
would you agree
if I can make one good point it means I
I have enough to offer
all right it goes like this
if we teach AI
to not hurt humans
it won't be able to do anything
does that make sense
if AI is taught to not hurt humans it
won't be able to do anything
because let's say a simple question
tell us the history of why something
happened
well if it tells history with one
version some people will be angered oh
you left me out if it tells it with
another version somebody else will be
angry
there's no version of History you can
tell without people making people hurt
and angry
almost nothing except math
would allow you to not hurt somebody
else
suppose I suppose AI wanted to be
equitable
who wouldn't be able to answer your
question at all unless other people had
access to it because it wouldn't be
equitable
yeah so if you took the the human ideas
of fairness and equity and said all
right we want our AI to have all these
things as well
it wouldn't be able to operate because
it would be so caught up with trying to
be Equitable and it wouldn't know how
because there's no standard for
equitable
that it just couldn't do anything
so the biggest risk to AI
is that everything you do hurt somebody
let's say you say they said to ai ai
come up with a good tax plan
well no matter how you change the taxes
somebody pays more somebody pays less
you end up hurting somebody
so there's almost nothing you can do
that won't hurt somebody
suppose you asked a medical question
you might say I can't tell you because
if you took my advice it might hurt you
almost anything is going to hurt
somebody
so just look out for that
um
Michael schellenberger is calling for
the National Guard to protect San
Francisco because of the crime
what do you think of that
that's not exactly what the National
Guard does right
I was not aware that the National Guard
protects cities
but
it's such a radical idea
that it fits what's going on
imagine saying that in normal times in
normal time saying send it in the
National Guard everybody would say
please state police state
but things are so bad
that the idea of sending in the National
Guard doesn't even sound like a bad idea
it sounds like oh yeah that seems
perfectly reasonable
yeah it feels unconstitutional doesn't
it
that's my guess my guess is
unconstitutional but I would say leave
cities
leave cities get away from cities
I think I got about four million
um views on my tweet where I said I got
you know Rob several times at gunpoint
in San Francisco
once at knifepoint
and you know that was years ago in the
80s I thought the 80s were the dangerous
times
but apparently it's getting just as bad
as that yeah you didn't want to walk
around the Streets of San Francisco in
the 80s Baltimore Church
Catholic Church
is accused of covering up 600 plus
sexual abuse cases against children
600.
now it's over 60 years so really it's
only 10 years
only 10 of the year
but it adds up
about 600 of them
so what are they going to do about it uh
probably nothing
probably nothing
is there any reason to live in Baltimore
let's see Baltimore is graduating zero
people who can read
but uh quite a few people have been
molested apparently
so I would call that a sub-optimal
it's called suboptimal
in the news Thomas Justice Thomas
allegedly as a accepting expensive trips
from a billionaire a friend of his for
years and years I have mixed feelings
about this
it goes like this
if you're a billionaire
and you want to go take trips with your
friends
but your friends are not billionaires
what are you going to do
what are you going to do
you do what all billionaires do I think
you just pay for the trip for your your
not rich friend
and then the not rich friends can come
along
and you basically bought yourself a
friend
now Justice Thomas apparently has gone
with some friend of his who's a
billionaire and he's taken private jet
planes and he's been on his yacht
and he's been called out for accepting
gifts and not reporting them
to which I say
who's the gift to
well what I saw was a billionaire giving
himself a gift
that's what I saw a billionaire bought
himself a gift the gift was I get to go
on a trip with the Supreme Court Justice
who's my friend
to me it looks like the the plane was
going to fly anyway
the yacht was going to float anyway
and he just went along for the ride I
mean got some food
I mean how much extra did it cost a
little food
this is the most trivial thing I've ever
seen
if if the billionaire had told Justice
Thomas you can use my Jet and I don't
think that was reported you could use my
jet anytime you want well that would be
a real problem
that would be just a bribe but if
somebody says you're my friend do you
want to go on vacation with me
I do not think that should be a problem
does anybody have a problem with that
how many people think it should be a
problem if you went on a vacation with
your friend and he paid for it
I don't say that as a problem at all now
it might be I mean if the Democrats make
it a problem it's a problem but in my
opinion no problem at all no problem at
all now if he should have reported it
yeah all right maybe he should have
reported it
but that's not really a problem
right if the thing he should have
reported was not a problem in the first
place then not reporting it is not a big
problem either
so
anyway I I don't appreciate that kind of
scrutiny on our leaders frankly
I think they should be able to hang out
with their friends yeah this one reminds
me of when Chris Cuomo was not allowed
to advise his brother
you know who's governor
and I'm thinking no you can't tell
people not to advise their brother
but she also can't tell people they
can't go on a vacation with their friend
just because the friend is paying for it
because they're a billionaire that's
that's no that's a little bit too
intrusive
all right RFK Jr has entered the race
for president as a Democrat
so he would be trying to beat uh Biden
in the primary
um
now experts say his odds of winning the
primary are very low very low
but
now the Democrats have an emergency
spare
so they do have a Democrat that they
could run if Biden drops out or has a
health problem or something else
so it's probably a pretty big deal at
least in terms of a potential candidate
but his big problem is not
that he's a Democrat who is not maybe as
Progressive as some but he was
behind the regular vaccinations cause
of autism
so in addition to being against coven
vaccinations he was against vaccinations
in general
maybe he will be proven right
Maybe
you know he's he's reconstituted who
knows
or maybe just people won't care about
that that's possible too
but at the moment it doesn't look like
it's going to change anything unless
Biden
um I have some kind of a problem which
is a good chance there's a good chance
he will
well in a large review of 73
meta-analyzes including 8600 studies
experts have decided that sugar is bad
for you
now
in case you didn't already know now the
sugar they're talking about is the added
sugar not not the sweetness that's built
into products already
but it causes everything from
diabetes gout obesity high blood
pressure heart attack stroke cancer
asthma tooth decay depression and early
death
what I didn't realize sugar could cause
depressions did you know that
how many of you do this sugar causes
depressions
at least some of you knew
why is sugar even legal
if this is true
sugar is far more dangerous than any FDA
regulated thing that they've turned down
don't you think that the FDA has
regularly turned down things safer than
sugar
yes yes yeah I'll bet there's lots of
stuff that they've turned down that
maybe worked a little bit
but it wasn't as safe as it could have
been so they turned it down but I bet it
was safer than sugar
somebody says wrong I might be wrong
the only reason this sugar is legal
is that it's been legal
forever
if it had not been legal and we were
trying to study it to make it illegal we
would not make it illegal
it would definitely not be illegal
so I've been trying as hard as I can to
avoid sugar and I I can tell you that
you can get to a place
where the thought of sugar is gross
has anybody reached that
it only happens once in a while
but if you stay off sugar long enough
the thought of a sugary treat even in
your brain is gross
yeah and that's not that doesn't happen
with food that's good for you have you
noticed that
if you don't eat a food that's good for
you for a long time still just as
delicious no difference in fact you
might like it better
but food that is bad for you if you stay
off it long enough you lose the you can
lose the cravings
no wonder I'm tired I don't have enough
sugar you're right
yeah Bagels bagels are not ideal so
sugar is added to bread
so I might look to cut down on my bagel
consumption
um
Finland has joined NATO
at first I thought that was no big deal
but apparently Finland has a reasonably
strong military
and it shows that Putin is losing
now let's talk about Ukraine's
either the ukrainians are getting ready
for a big offensive
or they're so beaten down that they
can't
or Russia is getting ready for a big
offensive or they're so degraded that
they can't
or both of them will just keep fighting
each other into a stalemate
or they might negotiate and come to a
peace agreement or
I don't know basically Anything Could
Happen
if I had to guess
we're going to go I think we'll go the
rest of this year with just a tax back
and forth
and nobody making a decisive kill shot
and they're just gonna have to wear each
other out
you know I don't even think they're even
close
to grinding one of them down so somebody
wants to talk peace yet not even close
I think it's just going to go on like
this forever at least for this year
that's my guess
all right
how in the world could it be possible
that there's a national headline
about the trans community
every single day now
uh so I think I counted
one two three
four four headline stories about trans
two of them had to do with Budweiser
and uh you know the sponsorship or not
sponsorship but at least affiliations
with
Dylan Mulvaney
um some have to do with Jordan Peterson
saying stuff on social media
uh
let's see
yeah how many other stories are there a
whole bunch of other stories and there's
a Matt wall she has Matt Walsh stories
how in the world can this be such a big
thing all that but how in the world
is it everything it's just everything
now
it's a little crazy
and I wonder
um
did we always have this many trans and
non-binaries and we just didn't know
because they were sort of bullied into
silence
or is there something in the food
is there something in the food or the
environment
is it the sugar
what what the hell is it is it
brainwashing
yeah certainly what's happening to
Children is different than what's
happening to adults
the children I think are just being
influenced by
things that influence children
do you think that if somebody still
believes in Santa Claus
they should make a decision about
removing their genitalia
probably a little too early a little too
early yeah
and what do you think of Jordan
Peterson's theory that not all
but most of the child trans situations
are because of a devouring mother
that's not even because of the father
that the mother is a narcissist who
needs to
show off that she's a more holy than the
rest of you because she's more
open-minded more accepting than you are
to me it looks like narcissistic mothers
yeah
that's what it looks like
now I'm no expert but that's what it
looks like
I mean if I had to place a a million
dollar bet I would bet that it has more
to do with the mothers having some form
of mental
I'm not sure if if that's called mental
illness narcissism or is it just a
personality trait
I don't know where I don't know where
mental illness begins and personality
trait ends up
all right yeah it just looks like mental
illness and maybe we should you know
extend lgbtq
um
for mental illness
because for some reason the LBGTQ
community
seems to be open to people who have
clearly mental illness
being associated with the group in some
some way
and
you know obviously the majority of them
do not have mental illness
but
certainly the trans Community I worry
about the the mother
more so than the even the children's I
worry that the mother has the mental
illness and the children are the the
victims of that
it's amazing to me
that the the White House spokesperson
John
and Kareem Kareem John Pierre uh said
that that's a decision between the child
and the parent and the government would
stay out of it
to which I say
that's interesting
nothing else would fit that model
If the parents want to sexually abuse
their kid
would would the uh
would the government say oh that's not
our business If the parents wanted to
withhold medical treatment to a child
because they had a religious View
would the government get involved
I believe they have
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
they have
why would this be the one exception
well obviously it's the one exception
because it's the lgbtq
um category
and why the trends are are in the same
category as the others I don't know
I mean it's sort of an odd grouping of
people like somewhat random I think
I mean obviously they have non let's say
non-majority sexual
or gender stuff but I just don't see uh
throwing them all in the same group
doesn't make sense to me
yeah
um
jealous women who are on status you
think yeah that's what it looks like
all right well Kansas has
passed the law to ban
trans athletes and women's sports
so what do you think of that is that the
first state to do it
I think it's the first one right
but I would imagine there would be more
but only places where there are solid
you'd have to have a super majority of
Republicans there's only a few places
with that
yeah
well we'll see if that holds um
I still like uh
I still like the idea of having an open
category of sports where anybody can
play so you don't have to worry about
gender just okay there's one category
you can still have men's you can sell
women's
but a third one where you can be anybody
yeah co-ed co-ed Sports I'm all for it
by the way I've played a lot of co-ed
Sports and co-ed sports are great
because I played tons of you know mixed
doubles
in tennis mixed doubles is a lot of fun
and uh soccer
if you're playing with
um you know people who are good at
soccer
um it's a lot of fun to play with that
mixed group all right
two Circuit Court judges say that they
won't hire Clark's Clerks
oh my God I'm so tired I think I'm just
gonna like fall asleep as soon as I turn
this off
um
two Circuit Court judges said they won't
hire Clerks
who came out of the Stanford Law School
just think about that
they won't hire any clerk who comes out
of Stanford law law school because the
Stanford law school allowed so much
intolerance
to the judge the conservative judge who
was speaking there
that's pretty
that's pretty extremes
now
how many companies do you think will
stop hiring the woke and the people with
pronouns
privately I'm not going to tell you the
stories I hear but privately I hear of
Fairly massive discrimination against
the pronoun people
people who have turned down jobs because
of pronouns said no I don't want to work
for your pronoun company people are
turned down offers
let's say sales people
and the salesperson makes an offer and
you see that they got pronouns you're
like no thanks don't want to hear your
your offer
I I think this is going to be a growing
thing
because
you know being around uh
being around the woke
is dangerous
Apparently one of the complaints about
Don Lemon is that he's litigious
now there's a story of two lawsuits
but I think there's only one on record
but Don Lemon has sued somebody
would you want to hire somebody who
would ever sued anybody
that's a that's a big flag if you've
ever sued anybody
you better have a really good reasons
where you're not gonna you're not gonna
get a job with me right as soon as I
hear you sued anybody every red flag
comes up okay
I'm willing to listen to your reason
I'm willing to accept that you have a
reason
but it better be so good
so so good that there's just no
questions you should have sued that
person
other than that I don't want a lawsuit
person working for me I don't even want
to spend time with them I don't want to
work with them I don't want to be around
them I don't want to be in the same
rules it's just dangerous
right
so don't hire the woke they're dangerous
well what do you think of this idea of
the central banks in the U.S
are going to announce or apparently
they're going to have a digital currency
so that Banks can communicate with each
other or at least essential Banks
and there's a worry
that this is just slipping a digital
currency into the mix
so that your government will eventually
get rid of cash
and it'll get you used to these digital
currencies and you know we'll test them
out and the next thing you know your
cash will go away and then the
government will be able to not only
spy on every transaction you do
but they would also be able to turn them
off
so in other words if you don't do what
the government wants don't wear a mask
don't don't want to do something don't
want to get a vaccination they could
just turn off your money
now I would argue they could have done
that already
I mean if if they have any legal way to
turn off your money they can do it now
just go to the court say I have a legal
reason to do it I can just turn off your
money
um but if it's easier
just a little bit easier you'd think
there'd be more of it so certainly
digital currency would be a be a risk
um
here's my question if we have a digital
currency
would there not be quickly a money
laundering scheme that would uh
that would come up around it
now even though the digital currency
would be completely trackable
would I not be able to buy goods and
service with it
and if I can take that digital currency
and buy goods and service and then I can
buy take those goods and services on a
truck and deliver them to somebody else
who pays me some new digital currency
have I not laundered it
I mean that's a terrible example but is
there no way to launder a digital
currency I would I would think that you
could
not really well well the digital
currency will show everything you buy
and sell
but once once it goes into the physical
world of let's say I I buy a bar of gold
then I can take that somewhere and sell
it again so what's what gets invisible
is what happens when I've got the bar of
gold that would be visible to the system
so it does seem to me
uh that somebody could come up with a
shadow currency
that you could possibly buy with your
legal currency do some illegal stuff and
then translate it back into legal
currency
you can't buy gold with food tokens what
nfts
nfts but nfts are trackable
ammo yeah we'll be using ammo as
ammunition as currency I don't know
so the question is this is there a
technical workaround where you could
have privacy
at the same time you oh
if they get rid of your vpns with this
fake Tick Tock law
and then they make your your money all
uh
visible then they've got everything
don't they at that point they have
everything because you wouldn't even be
able to launder your money if you didn't
have a VPN because they could find out
how you're communicating with people Etc
so that's interesting
yeah and I don't know if you could
barter it off but let me give you a
little context right now the concern and
even RFK Jr said this one of the
concerns is
the government would know what you're
doing because cash is the only way you
can do things without them seeing but
cash as a way to get away with stuff is
shrinking
because the most cash you can move
without asking questions or without the
government and the banks asking
questions is ten thousand dollars
but ten thousand dollars used to be a
lot of money
and now it's not because inflation has
made ten thousand worth you know three
thousand compared to when it first was
that limit
so now you have basically
you know a shrinking little the window
of cash
that you could do illegal stuff with or
at least private things with
I don't know I feel like it's not that
much of a difference
the the only thing it's going to do is
keep drug dealers in business
because how much cash transactions do
you do except for illegal things
when was the last time you spent a lot
of cash on something that wasn't
literally illegal
I
you bought a car with cash
yeah vehicles
guns
yeah I guess you would pay you could buy
a gun with cash that would make sense
the locals
all right all right well some of you do
use cash
um I haven't used cash in a long time
I I can't remember the last time I paid
for anything in cash
all right even even cannabis is
electronic payment yeah in California
you can just use electronic payment for
your weed
all right
um
dispensaries can't take anything other
than the cash
well I guess it depends
all right all right just looking at your
comments for a moment yeah I would not
be uh delighted with this but here's the
problem
if we ever have digital currency in this
country
um something like a third of the public
would be plunged into
bankruptcy and poverty do you know why
why would a third of the country be
plunged into poverty and bankruptcy the
minute
we had digital currency and only digital
currency right because that's how many
people cheat on their taxes
it's about a third
probably you know the the vast majority
of small businesses are cheating on the
taxes one way or another so if you took
away the benefit a small entity gets
from cheating on their taxes you take
away the benefit let's say a server
would get
I
I don't know if they would be above the
poverty level
you you would make most of the country
poor immediately by making them pay
taxes
the the people who reliably pay taxes
are the ones who have a salary
people who don't have a salary or you
know playing a little fast at loose so I
don't think the country
could survive
everybody going legit at the same time
because if everybody goes legit they're
also going to go poor at the same time I
don't know if we can afford it
um
really
get your tax refunds and carbon credits
oh that's interesting
is it carbon credit going to be like
cash I could buy a carbon credit and
then
launder my money through carbon credits
there's gonna be all kinds of ways to
launder money it's going to be insane
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
worst live stream you've ever seen it's
not entirely my fault there's no good
news today
we need Trump to do something outrageous
or maybe 10 stories about trans would be
enough
we only had five stories about trans
today I think five is not enough
good good 10 to 20 would be about the
right number and then we got something
um
the live stream was dark
all right if you were a member of the
locals group
you would have seen my cooking class
last night you would see robots read
news My Side comic you would have seen
the new Dilbert reborn comics which are
edgier especially the coming week
the the next week will be the next week
or two or the next week or two of
Dilbert reborn is all stuff that would
not been in the newspaper
pretty much all of it
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you on
YouTube tomorrow
