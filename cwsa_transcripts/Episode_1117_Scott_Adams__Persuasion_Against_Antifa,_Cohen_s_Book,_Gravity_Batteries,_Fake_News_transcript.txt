yeah that's a look out my window
at the smoky california air
that is the air i have to breathe if
you're thinking that looks like
fog you'd be wrong if you think it looks
like
low clouds you'd be wrong
that is what i have to breathe and it's
like that every summer lately because
california
mass but let's talk about
other stuff but before we do that
should we prepare yes we should because
the most exciting part of the day is
about to happen now
it's called the simultaneous sip and by
the way omar i haven't forgotten about
you
i am going to get back i am going to get
to that um
all you need is a copper margarita glass
a tanker chelsea stein the canteen joker
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better except the air quality
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
well there is a smell of sulfur in the
air so
i'm guessing kamala harris is in the
state
i don't know just a guess um
somebody alerted me to the fact that
wikipedia has been updated
to to include my hoax
except that they don't know it's a hoax
which should tell you everything you
need to know about wikipedia
so wikipedia thinks that i believe that
biden and harris
have satanic messaging the part they
miss
is that when i introduced this idea i
said
publicly and clearly i don't believe in
satan
i'm just going to see if they take me
out of context sure enough
got taken out of context which is
hilarious to me
would be frightening to the rest of you
probably
so there's a story about a california
fire
that's already burned 10 000 acres and
it was uh it was started by a gender
reveal party
they had some kind of explosive device
or incendiary device or something anyway
they
they had a party they exploded something
that burned
10 000 acres and i wondered what
name you would give the baby what would
be a good baby name
for a baby whose gender reveal party
destroyed ten thousand acres in flames
and counting
i'm gonna go with sparky don't you think
sparky would be a good nickname no
matter what the baby's name would be
hey how'd you get that name well it's
embarrassing
my parents burned up half of california
so they call me sparky um
michael cohen's book i guess is out
because there's a bunch of tweets about
it
and i don't i don't know if you've
read any of the quotes but they're so
over the top
that they actually just read as funny
now
yeah there was a time when you'd say to
yourself trump said
what and you think
i'm a little worried about that what's
that mean but it's become so ridiculous
at this point the things that people are
making up and putting in
trump's mouth that's i think the white
house called a fan
fiction and i've got a feeling none of
it is going to have
any impact i think these are all the
things that people
think are going to have an impact and
absolutely nobody cares
here's why number one we have four years
of trump
we don't really have to wonder what he
would do or how he would act as
president
we know exactly how he's going to act so
revealing all these little things he may
or may not have said
at some point in the past doesn't really
tell you anything you need to know
because what you need to know is what
kind of president would he be
asked and answered we just watched it
for four years
so if you want more of that you know how
to get it
and if you don't want more of that you
don't really need to read michael
cohen's book
because what will michael cohen's book
tell you
that you didn't know already did you
know
this may come as a shock to you but did
you know that
trump sometimes says things which people
find offensive
i know big surprise right
you didn't know that and that's really
all we're finding out
so because the fake news and the critics
want to put it in the worst possible
sense they'll turn it into he's a racist
he's a
he's whatever but it all kind of fits
into one category doesn't it
if you take everything that trump is
accused of
saying or thinking and you and you just
sort of
tried to summarize it it's that he
offends people
who didn't already know that there's
oh somebody is saying that the baby name
should be smoky
smoky would be a funny baby name smokey
sparky
all right and here's the
trick that the fake news and the
publishers and the authors are playing
on you and it goes like this
imagine if you will close your eyes
and imagine that all of your private
conversations
the things you said one-on-one to your
closest
confidants over the course of your life
imagine that all of your private
conversations
suddenly became public
how would you look would you look
offensive maybe
maybe just a little bit would you look
like you're
a little bit biased or bigoted or
maybe have some bad qualities would you
look like you're a horn bag or
or you're crazy maybe
and here's here's the trick it's sort of
a magic
trick if you will on the public the
trick is
that the way all of us talk privately
to people we trust is completely
different
than the way we would speak publicly
because if you're speaking publicly
you will speak in a way that you will
protect your reputation
but also importantly you would protect
the feelings of the people you are
talking to
because you don't need to make any
enemies right
so when you when you speak in public you
you speak a certain way that doesn't get
anybody hurt or you try to
when you speak privately you don't have
to worry about that
because nobody's going to hear it except
the person you're talking to
in a perfect world in the real world if
you run for president and they decide
they don't like you
they might write a book someday so
when they take private conversations
which wouldn't hurt
anybody and they move them into the
political realm
i say that responsibility for the
message
once moved from the private realm to the
public
should be on the messenger that's right
so anything that you learned in the
cohen book
that is offensive should be attributed
to cohen
because if cohen didn't tell you you
wouldn't know it
are the things that you would say in
public that you think are not really
harm
they're not harmful they're not meant to
any bad intention
but they're pretty raw you would just
say it privately you just wouldn't say
the same thing in public
let me give you a specific example so
you can get
the sense of this president trump is
alleged
to have said that the uh
the the service people who fought in
vietnam
were suckers now i don't think you can
believe
any of these reports because all these
anonymous reports etc
they they just don't have credibility
but
let's take it as our example and suppose
he did
suppose that did happen what would you
say to somebody
in a private conversation if they said
to you
you know i think that the people went to
vietnam
they you know they meant well they were
serving their country
but you feel bad for 19 year olds 18
year olds are joining the service
because they don't know or they didn't
know
that the press and the government were
running a scam
that the war was not legitimate
and so privately you might say to your
friends
you know i think the service people who
who fought in that war
as noble as their motives were they were
suckers
they were suckers because if they'd
known
that the war was useless and couldn't be
won and didn't have a purpose anyway
maybe they would have resisted but
instead they were good americans good
patriots did as they were told did as
the country asked
that's not wrong it's just that the
purpose they were asked
to go fight didn't really have a good
justification
so if you were talking to your friend
privately who understood you
knew your new year your mind knew your
heart if you will
and you said you know i gotta say the
people who fought in that war were
were kind of suckers would that offend
you if your friend said it and nobody
else was supposed to hear it
let's say neither of you had served or
alternately let's say both of you had
served so that
your peers whichever way that goes
i think you would not be offended by
that yeah
who'd winked might be better if somebody
says in the comments
hoodwinked might be a better uh way to
put it
you know that trump uses the more
aggressive language for just about
everything
so if his meeting was these these
um these young people who got drafted in
most cases
right they didn't choose it they got
drafted
and they got drafted into a bad
situation
if he called them suckers privately
would you have disagreed with that if
you knew that he
respected the service because he's your
friend so you know that
you just think that he's making a case
that the government screwed
a generation right so i i've got a
feeling that when people hear these
stories
that trump said privately and they hear
that somebody
who was really an made them
public
let me say this as clearly as i can if
there's something that you know
happened privately and you're the one
who makes it public
and then it becomes offensive because
it's public
couldn't have offended anybody privately
because there was nobody listening to it
you're the there's just no way
around that
it's not the person who said it it's you
it's you michael cohen are the one who
made it offensive
by making it public it is you
atlantic magazine and jeffrey goldberg
who are the because
whatever trump said or didn't say could
not have hurt anybody
when he did it and he would have known
that
a private conversation just doesn't hurt
anybody
by making it public plenty of hurt
because it it actually degrades
the readiness of our military because it
makes
puts some question in people's heads
about the
you know the commander-in-chief that is
one of the most
despicable acts of unpatriotic
 array you will ever see in your
life
it would be hard to like even invent a
scenario
short of actually directly hurting
people that
you could do a thing that would be more
despicable than taking a private
conversation
that didn't hurt anybody and turn it
into a public conversation
that degrades the entire military
readiness of the united states
creates chaos creates a race war creates
god knows what that is serious assholery
i mean that's like a 10 and a 10. and
i don't know if the public is
sophisticated enough
to do the mental uh you know the mental
gymnastics of saying oh wait wait wait
i have to i have to view this as though
it were a private conversation
because that's the way it originally
started and that's a whole different
context
all right so i've got a feeling that
just like the michael wolff book
the michael cohen book will will be you
know
some headlines for a few days and then
everybody will say
we don't like michael cohen
how much do people like lawyers
not much right you know unfortunately
lawyers do not have a great reputation
but let me ask you this how much do
people like lawyers
who screw their own client
now you could say to yourself hey trump
you know
should have pardoned cohen whatever
but isn't it true that what you see
is a lawyer who you already felt a
little not so comfortable with
because lawyers are not that popular and
then this lawyer
actually publicly crucified his own
client
and his ex-best friend
that's the worst person in the world
okay
if your lawyer goes to jail that's a bad
lawyer
if your lawyer goes to jail and then
writes a tell-all book
in which at least some of this looks
like he's just completely made up
that's the worst lawyer who ever lived
you can't even get
you you couldn't even design a worse
lawyer than this
all right how about some good news
there's uh last week a british energy
startup
uh came up with this idea that looks
like it could work
for storing energy using massive weights
so in other words they'll use they'll
use energy to lift
a weight on a pulley and then when they
want to
release the energy you know in a battery
sense
like a battery they just let the
gigantic weight
go down the pulley and it you know
generates electricity
by making something turn
it turns out that this idea looks
actually completely doable
on paper and that it's it's come down to
just an
engineering kind of a situation now it
might turn out that like windmills
it sounds better on paper but then you
have maintenance issues and it kills
some burrs and nobody saw that coming so
much
or at least not to the extent that it
happened so we don't know if it'll work
but apparently they want to use
abandoned mines
they have gigantic vertical holes that
go down
it could be like a mile a mile of depth
and put that giant weight in there
and apparently they can generate um just
a ton of electricity
but remember it's a battery so you have
to put the electricity in
before you can get it out but still
having a
gigantic battery would be cool somebody
on twitter whose name i didn't write
down but it was a good comment i wish i
had
said why why do you need a big hole in
the ground
why don't you just use a uh something
like a train
a car on a mountain on a train track
you know why does that have to be under
the ground why can't it just be
some heavy object on a track to which i
say
i wonder there may be a difference in
just the uh
how much friction is involved maybe
there's an engineering reason why that
isn't that isn't good enough to just put
it on a hill
but here's the other thing that i ask if
you can dig
or even find gigantic holes
can't you use those gigantic holes
to condition homes meaning
use the the fact that the temperature
under the earth
is usually around 56 degrees no matter
what
and you can use that to pump up air to
cool a home if it's too warm
or to warm the whole warm a home if it's
below 56 degrees
so could you use abandoned mines
wherever there are gigantic holes in the
ground that exist
could you not use them for building a
town nearby
that uses that for its heating and
cooling
and takes 50 percent off the cost of
that
or something anyway the so there are
some good news
happening because entrepreneurs continue
to entrepreneur
and inventors continue to invent and
while we're
concentrating on all this political
assholery
there are real good citizens creating
good solutions for the future
yeah geothermal is the
is one of the words i was looking for
there all right um
the company name is gravisit gravisit
gravicity gravitricity
gravitricity is the name of them they
need a little help on the name of their
company
all right yeah and somebody's mentioning
in the comments
elon musk's company the boring company
that bores holes i've often thought that
if you just board a gigantic tunnel
that would be the first start of
building a town above it
for the same reasons you could use your
tunnel for
running all of your utilities but it
could also be a source of your
heating and cooling could be
transportation under the town
could be a lot of things i i've said
this before but
our ability to inexpensively dig really
deep holes
is going to be one of the key
technologies of the future
yet the fact that elon musk
owns a a whole a whole digging
you know technology and company
it kind of tells you that that's a
bigger deal
than just a good idea it really is the
future
you know the ability to dig cheaply
underground is the future
here's a thought i want to just put in
your head as we're obsessed with
all things coronavirus and virus and
epidemics have you noticed how much
china is treating islam like a virus
if it's true the stories we're hearing
about what china is doing with the
uyghur
minority they are muslim minority within
china
and the reports are that they're being
rounded up and put in
in essentially concentration camps
and who knows what other badness is
happening besides that
but if you look at the way china treats
islam
they treat it exactly like a virus
because the first thing they do is
quarantine
and like a virus like a regular virus
religion does transfer by
association if you never had connection
with anybody
physically or over the internet or any
other way
if you never had contact with anybody
who had a religion
you probably wouldn't develop one
spontaneously it's
it's physical contact and communication
that makes religion spread
so i'm not going to say this is good or
bad because
you know you can put your own obvious
morality on top of this but it's
interesting
that china treats religion like a
medical problem
are they wrong because we treat mental
health as a medical problem
don't we we didn't always but today
our more enlightened view of the world
is that if you have a mental problem
that's a health problem
you know is no more or less a health
problem than a broken leg
it's just part of your body is not
functioning the way you'd want to
and and we would treat things like
let's say you were brainwashed to do
something terrible you know to be a
nazi or something we would treat that
as like a mental condition and
it's interesting that china treats
religion in general now in this case
they're they're treating islam that way
but i think they do the same with the
falun gong and i think they would do the
same with any
you know christian sect in china if
there was such a thing
so it has more to do with religion than
it has to do with islam
but it's an interesting approach
as immoral as it is um
here's something we learned from the
coronavirus
that the regular flu was always
i saw the president say this in an
interview i i didn't see it when it went
live it was
from not too long ago he did an
interview
in which he was pointing out that he
personally the president
knew several people who had died from
the coronavirus
so personally he knew several people who
died from coronavirus
but as trump said and i've said a number
of times as well
how is it that we've gone our entire
lives and never heard of anybody dying
from the regular flu
your whole life because even if you say
to yourself but scots got scott
this coronavirus killed way more people
so it's obvious that you would
be aware of more of them to which i say
no no let me do the math for you
i've been live let's say let's round it
off from
the moments let's say 50 years or so of
my life
i've been old enough that i would have
noticed if anybody died for a specific
reason
so let's take 50 years of my life and
multiply it by the
50 000 people that supposedly died
uh cover up your speaker for a moment
alexa what is fifty times fifty thousand
fifty times fifty thousand is two point
five million
so that would be 2.5 million people
who would have died just in the united
states
of the regular flu during my let's say
that 50-year period where
when i was old enough to to know if
somebody died
um and why they died
over two million people and i don't know
any of them none of them that's
ten times as many as have died you know
more than 10 times have died from the
coronavirus in the united states
and i don't know anybody who's died of
the regular flu
now trump called this out in the
interview and i've never heard anybody
else say it
who was a public figure and he just
raised the question why have i never
heard of
anybody dying of the regular flu now he
was using it more of a
more to make the point that the
coronavirus was bad stuff
which was a really good way to make the
point i'm making a slightly different
point which is
i think we've been lied to for
my whole life i don't think the regular
flu
is all that dangerous compared to what
we've been told
i do think the chronovirus is dangerous
but part of what made people say the
coronavirus
is not that dangerous is the belief
that 50 000 people a year were dying
from regular flu
i don't think that ever has happened i
think
it was always and that the
coronavirus
is special that's what i think but i
could be wrong
it's always a good thing to say after
everything you assert
if if i could give you one good habit
for
open-mindedness it would be this
we know from the the study of influence
and persuasion we know
that if people simply make a statement
or write down a statement
especially if they say it in public they
come to believe the thing they said
even if they didn't believe it in the
first place
so when i finish a finish speculation by
saying
i could be wrong the i could be wrong is
not just for you
when i finish a statement that is
obviously speculative
and that i say but i could be wrong i'm
talking to myself
and that's part of my self programming
to remind myself i could be wrong it's a
really good
thing to do that so if you think i was
talking to you
when i said i could be wrong i was a
little bit
but mostly that's programming myself
that's a good it's a good strategy you
should use it
so one thing that black lives matter and
antifa have in common besides wanting to
tear down the government uh is they both
seem
relatively okay with sexual assault
now isn't that a weird thing to say
because if you ask them
i'm sure they would say no no
are you crazy we're not okay with sexual
assault
that's crazy but they do act that way
because antifa literally wants to do
away with the police
what do they think is going to happen
when the police go away it's going to be
massive
sexual assaults as well as massive every
other kind of crime
there's not really an alternative to
that happening
so we know that antifa wants an end
state in which there would be massive
sexual assault
they don't say that's a goal but it's
obviously what would happen there's
there's no way around that really black
lives matter as you're watching them
they're talking about the um
forgetting the names there are so many
victims now that i'm getting their names
mixed up
what a terrible world when there are so
many famous
victims of police actions that i can't
keep their names straight
you know at one point it was it was a
perfectly reasonable thing for the
protesters to say
you know they would say the name say the
name say the name to make sure you
didn't forget somebody
who had been you know in this situation
but now there are enough of them that
i'm
i think i could be forgiven for
forgetting which one is which
it's getting hard to keep them all
straight which of course is black lives
matter's
very point and so that point is taken
um but we're watching this latest case
of the uh gentleman who got
shot seven times and was accused of a
sexual assault before that
now i'm gonna say alleged and accused
because
just because he got shot seven times
does not make him guilty of an unrelated
crime
can we agree at least can we at least
agree
that no matter how many times he got
shot for something else
that doesn't make him guilty of the
unrelated allegation
but it might be um but it does seem to
me that black lives matter is
de-emphasizing the the sexual assault
uh emphasizing the police action and
that's a choice
it's a choice to you know lower that
priority
so there's one thing that antifa and
black lives matter have in common
is less concerned about sexual assault
and i think the republicans get that
right because the republicans are kind
of obsessed
with that topic especially if anybody
underage is involved
that is a very republican
kind of thing to to go after stopping
that
and the president's actually had amazing
well during his administration it's hard
to know who gets all the credit for what
but during the trump administration the
actions against
every kind of sexual trafficking have
been unprecedented
so that's that's another gigantic
difference
that should be mentioned more i think uh
i want to confess some stupidity
and i know i'm doing this and i've let
me remind you before i
i do this that i've told you that one of
my superpowers and indeed i think one of
the
values that i can bring is that i'm not
embarrassed by stuff
and it's a it's a learned skill
to not be embarrassed by stuff and so
i'm going to embarrass myself now
by confessing something i don't
understand
that i think many of you do understand
and maybe you could explain it to me
now sometimes when i say something
doesn't make sense i'm asserting
i'm asserting that there's something
wrong with the thing because it doesn't
make sense
in this case i'm not asserting that i'm
asserting that there must be something
wrong up here in my head
area somewhere in the brain department
just to me personally that there's
something that other people seem to
understand that i don't
and let me put it out there here's what
i don't understand
when president trump or people who agree
with him
say that the reason we're discovering so
much virus
in this country is because we're doing
more testing
and the critics say oh
how stupid that was stupid it's just not
true
it's just not true ask all the experts
the amount
you're testing has nothing to do
with how much virus you're detecting and
every time i hear that i go
okay continue continue making the point
so i can see the part where you say that
doing the thing that detects the virus
is not the thing that's detecting the
virus
because there's probably a good reason
all the smart people are saying it
you know all the anti-trumpers say it
they say it consistently
and i believe there are even pro-trump
people who say it
and and they mock him
like it's just sort of obvious why
that's wrong
and i say to myself what's
wrong with me why can't i tell
what's going on here i don't honestly i
don't even have
i don't even have a theory for why
that's wrong
now is this one of those situations
where cnn etc are just telling you that
an apple is banana and they're just
trying to get away with it
or is there actually a smart version of
this
where they can explain why testing does
not
find more virus
tests are all wrong some people are
saying that's a different topic
all right so i'm looking at your
comments i don't think
anybody understands that
yeah so
are all of you all right here's the
funny part
the reason i've never mentioned this in
public
is because i thought it was just me
i thought i was being stupid because i
can't imagine a scenario
where doing more testing doesn't produce
more positive outcome
more positive results i
don't get it all right so apparently
there's nobody here who even understands
what the argument is
much less agrees or disagrees it's it's
like you don't even
know what they're talking about and we
let that go
like that's okay i guess it is okay
they might be looking at positivity rate
somebody said
i don't know numbers are numbers
all right let's uh but if somebody does
have an answer for that and i still
think there might be
send it along
i love the fact that the president is
teasing that there might be a vaccine
sooner than you think and
there's a big discussion about the fact
that the vaccines might be being
rushed to have them done before the
election
now would it be good for the president
if the vaccine
started to be available even if only for
a few people
before election day would that be good
for trump
maybe depends how the news handled it
they might say
it's rushed and therefore it's worse
than not having it
that's what kamala harris seems to be
indicating
but let me give you a dose of the real
world
are you ready this is if you're
below a certain age this will be the
first time you've ever heard this
and this is a truism of big
organizations
of projects of everything
this is a universal truth
if you don't give somebody a deadline
it'll never get done if you don't give
somebody a deadline
it'll never get done things get done
on the deadline doesn't matter what it
is
this is something i've experimented with
all my life
uh and i'll give you a concrete example
when i was
first doing my comic strip uh
while i was working full-time sometimes
i would sit there in the morning before
i went to my day job
and all of my time would get used up and
i hadn't drawn a comic i just couldn't
come up with an idea
and i had 10 minutes literally 10
minutes because i would never let myself
go a day without making a comic
to make whatever i could make to make a
comic
and what happened i would always a
hundred percent of the time
with no exceptions over 30 years haven't
missed it
once 10 minute deadline
to do a day's work i could fit a day's
work
into 10 minutes now of course
cartooning's not like other jobs
but the point is if you don't have a
deadline
things just don't happen and it almost
doesn't matter where the deadline is
you could say the deadline's next year
you could say the deadline is this
my guess is and i don't know this field
but the people who make the regular
vaccine for the regular annual flu
don't you think they have deadlines it's
probably an internal deadline
it's probably a deadline that looks like
this if we don't have this done by
pick a day if we don't have this done by
september we won't get to make any money
this year
because it'll be too late so i would
imagine that every vaccine has at least
an internal company deadline because if
it didn't
nothing would happen nothing gets done
without a deadline
and the part if you're young this is the
part you don't know and i would
encourage you
if this sounds like ridiculous if the
first time you hear this you say
that's that doesn't make any sense at
all
i would ask you to talk to somebody
experienced
in just life if you give a deadline
people will need it it's it's like magic
it's one of the greatest tricks of
management is that people
do work toward deadlines it's just
that's it
and so when the president makes and i
think we would all agree
an artificial deadline to get this done
by let's say before election day does
that
make the world a worse place or a better
place
now if you're inexperienced what you're
going to say to yourself whoa
that's going to make them cut corners
that's a dangerous situation
that would be the inexperienced view of
the world and i think the democrats
will count on you or enough people to
have an experienced world view
here's the experienced world view
those fda people and the people who have
to approve this
they're not going to throw away their
whole lives to approve something that
doesn't look solid
there are a lot of people who are going
to put their whole
careers on the line to sign off on this
thing
and they would i think most of them or
at least enough of them
would be willing to quit rather than put
something out
that didn't they didn't feel comfortable
with so this deadline will
almost certainly cause one of two things
to happen
it'll either be done before election day
and it will be solid or it won't be done
because the fda will not have have
approved it
there are only two possibilities so the
possibility of it being done before
election day
and and being shoddy and having the
president force people to
say things they don't believe are true
about the safety of it
very unlikely in the real world very
unlikely
because this is life and death if it
were just a project
and maybe there was just money on the
line oh yeah
you get people to lie about that it
would be easy to get people lying about
you know how good is your product or
anything like that but life and death
we're talking about you know people in
the fda or whoever has to
sign off on stuff we're talking about
people who would know
they would be putting their name on
something that could
kill or injure tens of thousands of
people if you know worst case scenario
that's not a that's not a risk people
take
all right typically and we would hope
that there's maximum transparency on
those people
and if the news business wants to keep
everybody honest which would be a good
idea we should get the names of the
people who
need to sign off both government and
medical
and really really talk to those people
know who they are
put the light on them and say here's the
deal
we are literally going to trust you with
our lives
we are going to trust you with the fate
of the republic
bob or whatever their names are
bob we're looking at you do not
sign that piece of paper bob or whoever
unless you're willing to put your life
on it that this is a good decision
nobody you know nobody's magic we can't
you can't be right all the time but
we're watching
bob we gotta have that going and we
don't have that right now
all right um i feel like the loser
sucker
hoax is already dying from neglect that
will just be replaced by the
michael cohen book which will be
replaced by something next week
so it looks like the whole loser sucker
thing just fell apart
and here's the rule that i would like to
put on this
which is um if somebody makes
several claims whether it's the steele
dossier or it's the
atlantic article and there's a major
claim within there
that can be debunked you're done
you don't need to debunk the rest of
them if you can determine that one of
them
is clearly a lie and clearly a lie that
somebody knew is a lie
you don't need to talk about the rest of
it
walk away and just say it's debunked
walk away
now the word that cnn used for debunked
is confirmed so they just put different
words on things
so cnn itself confirmed that the story
about
why the you know the one event was
canceled because of weather
they've also confirmed that that's not
true
they too should say and therefore the
entire body of work
is disqualified but they don't
all right um i was
thinking about ways that the protests
could be
let's say handled or solved
and i was throwing out some ideas on
twitter let me run a few of these
by you um
well let me do some whiteboarding for
you
i just noticed that my
lighting is terrible i still have my
lights my curtains up
excuse me while i put down my curtains
and improve things a little bit
um i want to go to the whiteboard here
because i don't think most people know
what black lives matter or
antifa even want so here's my model of
the world
so before you can argue anything or
persuade you have to get people in
a common frame or understanding of the
world
i would say democrats are favorable to
antifa
and to black lives matter so far would
you say that that is true
that neither neither that the democrats
don't really
criticize of course they don't criticize
black lives matter
uh but even antifa to the extent that
antifa
are part of the protests democrats are
you know sort of on their side what does
antifa want
how many americans know what antifa
wants
if you ask them they'd say they want an
end to racism
does does antifa want an end to racism
who knows it might be part of what they
want but what they really want is the
destruction of civilization
now they don't word it that way what
they say is we want to get rid of
all government and all
and all police let's say they were
successful
let's say antifa got rid of all
government and all law enforcement
what would be the obvious undeniable
outcome of that well we would be
conquered by any other country that
wanted to
because we would be a sitting duck
anybody could conquer us
but beyond that if we had no centralized
government of any kind we would just
devolve into sort of a tribal situation
you wouldn't have entrepreneurship you
wouldn't have anything
because if anybody worked and made money
they would have to immediately share it
or they would be attacked by the the
masses to take their stuff
so there's no there's no doubting this
that what antifa wants is the end of
civilization
they they pretty much say it as directly
as i do
they just don't fill in the blanks like
i did which is
what would happen if you got what you
wanted it would be the end of
civilization
there's not there's no argument to that
that's just what it would have to be
because they do not account for human
motivation
it would be great if humans could all
share and still work hard and they would
still have motivation and you didn't
need a government because we were all so
nice that we would just agree on things
but that's not the real world in the
real world if you disband your military
the country next to you conquers you in
10 minutes
that's the real world now let's take
black lives matter
they do not want an end of civilization
so it's weird that they're on the same
team what they want
is to take your stuff meaning anybody
who's now black
and to solve systemic racism
by a transfer of wealth
now if you ask them would they say that
does black lives matter say
yeah what we'd like to do is solve
systemic racism
by taking your stuff and giving it to
black people
they kind of do they kind of do say that
because what would reparations be
reparations would be
taking things and redistributing them
what would any of socialism be
socialism you know 90 tax rates the
things they're talking about would be
taking things that legally belong to
other people
but here's the key maybe not morally
that would be their argument so the
black lives mar
matter argument would be yeah yeah you
you white people and other people have a
lot of stuff
but you wouldn't have that stuff if not
for slavery
so really even though the law says it's
your stuff
it's not really morally your stuff so
we're just gonna
adjust things until they're morally
comparable
and that would require a change in the
law perhaps or legislation or whatever
so what happens if you have a system
that's based on transferring resources
from
people who make it and have it to people
who aren't making it and don't have it
the end of civilization
there's no other way that goes either it
looks different
because they're not thinking about you
know the end state
they're just thinking about can we solve
systemic racism
and this would be the way to do it some
kind of a transfer of wealth
it all ends in the same place it ends
with a destruction of civilization
now why don't the
republicans make that case i don't know
that's what i'd do here's what the
republicans
are offering or could they're offering
school choice in all of its forms under
the theory that if you've got a school
choice
you at least have you have the
opportunity
to make something of your life can't
guarantee it
nobody's guaranteeing you good outcomes
but
at least you have the opportunity i
would argue however that there's a
missing component
and the missing component is that no
matter what school you choose
they're probably not teaching you life
strategies
they're not telling you how to succeed
and my belief
is this the people who use similar
strategies
in life get similar outcomes if you're
black
and you get a's in school you don't join
a gang you don't do drugs
you you probably could get a scholarship
to college
how is your life going to turn out
pretty good
pretty good if you're white
and you're born with let's say white
privilege but you
do drugs do crimes and go to jail
you know get your 14 year old girlfriend
pregnant
and don't pay attention in school how
does your life turn out
does it turn out great because of all
your white privilege
no turns out terrible so the big magic
trick that black lives matter and to
some extent antifa
are doing is to make it seem as if the
way you
act in life doesn't matter
it doesn't matter let me give you some
advice
if you're ever in a discussion with
anybody over any topic
doesn't have to be any of this stuff
just in general and the other party says
here's the deal all of the changes have
to be on your side
and our side we will simply be the
benefit of your changes
if they say that walk away
there is no such thing as a negotiation
where one side
gives and the other side takes
you maybe you would like that to be the
case but that
becomes a case of negotiating with
yourself
how about i give you this thanks now
give us some more
uh okay well i thought it was done but
okay i'll give you a little more
thank you um now how about some more
wait a minute where's this end where's
the end of us giving you stuff
if you don't tell us what you want
it's we would be idiots to give you
anything
so that should be you know logic
number one which is if you're not asking
for something specific
we will offer you zero
because to do otherwise is just stupid
it's just stupid
because you can't negotiate with
yourself you have to have somebody on
the other side who says
if we got this it would be enough maybe
we could meet in the middle
so i would say that the republicans
could have a good case if they said
if you get school choice right that's
not enough they've got to teach
some kind of a life strategy about how
to stay in a trouble
here's how i would teach a life strategy
in the second grade
or first grade you want to keep it
simple right
and whatever somebody learns when
they're really really young
that becomes extra sticky in terms of
brainwashing
so you want to brainwash kids every kid
i'm not talking about black kids and
talk about every kid you want to
brainwash them early
about life strategies and because
they're kids
you got to keep it simple and i would
keep it this simple here's my idea
we call it the 100 life so instead of
saying i'm going to teach you a life
strategy you're already losing a first
grader
they're like the strategy don't even
know what that word means
so instead you make it a checklist and
you say
here's how to have 100 life 100 life
just means a full life
that's got all the good stuff in it if
you
commit a crime subtract four points
if you get bad grades in school subtract
seven points if you become addicted to a
substance
subtract 25 points whatever the numbers
are i'm just putting random numbers on
stuff
but you could actually have a checklist
of say five to ten items
and you just tell the kids if you want
your life to be a hundred percent
make sure you don't check any of these
boxes of of these big mistakes
here's these here's why this would work
simplification always works but it's
better to say
you could lose something then if you do
something you might gain something in
the future
imagine telling a first grader that if
you work hard today
25 years from now you're going to have a
good time doesn't work
because people don't respond the same to
opportunity
as they do to the risk of losing
something so instead
you reverse the equation and you say you
were born with a hundred percent
life your life is perfect in first grade
you know your home life might be a
disaster but in terms of where you could
go
100 if you did all the right stuff but
i'm going to take away from you
some of your life if you make these
mistakes and then people start seeing it
as a loss
wait a minute i was born with 100
potential
and then i made this choice in this
choice and i could see how that
diminished my potential
and then i could look at all the older
people who are not having a good life
and i could say wait a minute
oh yeah this checklist totally works
that that person's having a bad life and
yep sure enough committed a crime joined
a gang
it's right here on the list got got
addicted to substance there it is
it's right on the list had a baby at 12
um it's on the list
so you could teach a first grader life
strategy by just give them a list of ten
things and say
don't do any of these ten things and
you'll you'll be fine
uh the republican approach should they
adopt something like this would be one
of abundance
where everybody could win so
you know that still becomes a problem of
equality
but if you took care of education and
life strategy
it might be as good as you can do so
it's not a perfect world but it might be
the best world that you could
produce so
that's how i would frame it if i were in
charge
um here are some just some more thoughts
on the same
topic um
have you wondered why there have been no
counter protests
for the portland stuff so portland
actually has
an a protester camp where they have nice
little tents it looks like they were
acquired from the same source and
they've got like a tent
village where they live i guess
they probably sleep during the day and
protest and riot at night
and i'm not recommending this because it
would be dangerous people would get hurt
but i'm wondering why it hasn't happened
that nobody has targeted their camp
while they're gone because you could
just destroy
again i'm not recommending this because
it'd be super dangerous people would get
killed
but i don't know why it hasn't happened
it feels like the obvious
thing would be some group of
anti-protesters would just wait until
the protesters mostly left the camps
and they would just go through and rip
it rip it apart or set it on fire
or or just steal their stuff or whatever
and i think that would go a long way
but i don't recommend it it would be
dangerous
just a question all right um did you
know
and fact check me on this that the
original antifa
was allied with hitler now i read this
on
online so you know fact check so here's
the claim
the claim is that antifa the original
one was against fascism
but also against organized government
just like it is now
and that when uh when they had a choice
of the weimar republic which was
unpopular in germany
or the nazis antifa actually chose the
nazis
because they were seemingly more
anti-government
in other words the nazis seemed to be on
their side
because they also didn't like the weimar
regime and so antifa
and the nazis allegedly i need a fact
check on this
worked together to overthrow the
government and then the first thing that
happened was uh
the uh the hitler got rid of antifa
because of course you don't want those
guys around so the first thing they do
is
is get rid of their partners and it made
me think
does antifa think ahead because
i can't see any scenario where they
don't lose
and literally die if if they get what
they're asking for
it's weird that people could get what
they're asking for and it guarantees
their destruction
but antifa has that philosophy i'd like
you to give me something
that destroys you but oh yeah it will
destroy me at the same time
that's a weird philosophy all right
um
uh i also think that uh
well i i'm confused about whether the
supporters of antifa
which is anti-fod-sol for the most part
are
lying to everybody else or if they
if they don't realize that antifa wants
to destroy civilization
is there anybody who's in favor of
antifa
who actually just doesn't understand
that in order for them to get what they
want civilization itself would have to
be destroyed
and not replaced with something better
because that option isn't there
it's not even it's not even something
that's unlikely
but you know if everything went right it
could happen it can't happen
there is no way that the united states
could have no government
which would be the antifa preference and
still survive in a world
where china still has a government and a
military
they would conquer us 10 minutes into
that plan
so i'm just curious whether it's
stupidity or
or what i don't get it all right
um one of the things that trump could do
to
mess with the protesters is ask them to
pick a leader
to negotiate with now what would happen
if trump said you know maybe you would
help
if we could listen to your concerns so
you
anti-fun blm people all you protesters
just do me a favor
select somebody who will be your
spokesperson and bring us some specific
demands
because if you ever saw their specific
demands
nobody would be in favor of them and and
the
the democrats the ones running for
office would have to disavow the
protesters
they would have to but they don't have
to disavow the protesters yet
because the protesters are cleverly not
asking for specific things
that you can really dig into and say yes
or no to
so defund the police sounds like it's
specific
but it's not because they don't know
what that means
does it mean the money goes somewhere
else do you replace that
with something else what do you do with
the government itself if you're antifa
you don't want the government so simply
asking the protesters to
to give you a coherent cohesive
leadership set of negotiating demands
should make the protesters turn on each
other
because it would would force them to
realize they're not actually on the same
team
because when it gets to the point where
they have to ask for something
they wouldn't ask for the same stuff it
would be different stuff
so it would turn them against each other
so all and i'm going to be working on
this high ground maneuver which is
getting people to understand that the
protesters want the end of civilization
but if somebody wants instead the end of
systemic racism
the only way to get it is through
education that's as close as you can get
you know there's nothing else that could
actually work but education could work
we know that
trump did a persuasion play that i
thought was
just frankly brilliant and i'm going to
give you
a comparison you remember i've told the
story a number of times
that i realized that trump could win it
all when i
especially when i saw him in the debate
the first debate
in the first election in which he was
challenged about his statements about
women
and he answered with the only rosie
o'donnell maneuver
now what made that special is that his
answer was so
funny and provocative that you couldn't
think about the original question
he he just sucked all the energy from
the question which would have ruined his
campaign
onto an answer that wasn't even an
answer
it wasn't even the right answer to the
question but it was so interesting you
wanted to talk about that
instead when trump was
dealing with these accusations about
calling soldiers losers
and suckers which i believe did not
happen
you couldn't directly disprove it
because you can't prove a negative you
can't prove something didn't happen
you could just prove that you don't see
any evidence of it
so he had this impossible situation
similar to megyn kelly
asking him this impossible question and
the debates
how do you get out of an impossible
situation
turns out there's one person in the
world who knows how to do this
and his name is president trump so what
did he do
he said this and by the way
anybody who misses the brilliance of
this
is really really missing a good show
because i know that
you know the president does a lot of a
lot of stuff that you
you think well i wouldn't have done that
but every now and then
he'll do something that is just
transcendentally
smart to the point where you can't even
recognize it
as smart it's so smart the smart people
can't recognize it as smart
here it is he said quote in his press
conference
i'm not saying the military is in love
with me
this is pacing all right he's agreeing
i'm not saying the military is in love
with me the soldiers are
so he's made a claim that the soldiers
like him and then he goes the top
people in the pentagon probably aren't
because they want to do nothing but
fight wars
so that all of those wonderful companies
that make the bombs and make the planes
and make everything else stay happy
trump told reporters
now do you see what he did that's the
rosie o'donnell move
how do you talk about some
unsubstantiated claims
about what trump may or may not have
said in private
which isn't all that important how do
you talk about that
when trump just dumped on you the most
explosive claim
any commander-in-chief ever made
ever which is that his generals are
dopes
and they're in it for the money oh
my god now
now here's the good part will he be
criticized
for being the commander-in-chief and
basically calling his
generals and top military people
corrupt will he be criticized for that
yes
how do you criticize him when he's
saying the same thing that
general dwight eisenhower said later
president eisenhower
i believe when he was leaving office and
they gave the speech about the
the famous speech about the military
industrial complex
meaning that the military was creating
wars
so that the the industry people could
make money selling
bombs and bullets so trump
mirrored eisenhower's most
probably the most respected speech any
president's ever given
in terms of it being true prophetic
important and totally non-um
what do you call it nonpartisan there is
nothing partisan
about eisenhower saying watch out for
this combination of the military in the
industry keep an eye on that that's what
trump said
now that is such a provocative thing
because remember
trump is currently the
commander-in-chief
it's one thing to say something as
you're walking out the door
and fact check me on that but didn't
eisenhower do his speech
after he was leaving office i think so
but that that would be an important
point
um trump did it while he's running for
reelection
that is a whole other level of
provocation
because he's saying i'm going to be the
boss over these people that i don't even
think are doing it for the right reasons
they look corrupt
to me how much do you want that
president
please if if trump had never done
anything else except throw his own
military
under the bus and say watch out for
these guys
they have a monetary motive to get us
into war if he had never done
anything else but just that one thing
he would have my vote he would have my
vote
would i care that he called the soldiers
who were sent to war by
by who sent the soldiers to war in
vietnam
was it the soldiers themselves
nope it was the military industrial
complex
who got us hooked up with the war in
iraq
was it because of all those weapons of
mass destruction
nope is because the military industrial
complex
got a new friend called the press
now it's the press military
industrial complex trump although he's
never stated
this way has basically added a third leg
to the eisenhower warning watch out for
the
fake news press military
industrial complex because they gave you
iraq and
here's the brilliant part they treated
our military
like suckers yeah
do you see it yet that's what trump did
he actually took trump said the
the service people were suckers the
worst thing you could ever hear right
our most respected class of people are
our military
we like it that way we like them to be
the most respected class
that just works it's just a good idea
and he took that
and turned that into the military
industrial complex and even my
own people in my organization treated
soldiers
like suckers
it's different isn't it now
now i know that i get a lot of heat from
my critics
who say scott scott scott you're you're
finding
you're imagining that you're finding
gold nuggets and this big pile of crap
and all it is is chaos and flailing and
and trump is doesn't know what he's
doing and he's just
you know he's incompetent he's just
waving his arms and stuff
and i say to you if
if my theory was correct from 2015
that trump plays 3d chess or 4d chess if
you prefer
and that he can do things that other
people just can't do
that that frame of mind would predict
that if he were president
as he is that he would continue to do
things
that you would say i don't think anybody
else could have done that
this is one of those things this is
something
i swear there is no other president who
could have gotten out of this trap
not only did he get out of the trap i
think we came out ahead
because now we're talking about the
military industrial complex i've added
the press
and i think we should because that's
where a big problem is
kind of brilliant that that is so
brilliant
you just you've never even seen a
president do anything that smart before
this is this is other level persuasion
smart
this is not normal people stuff you know
i
i don't think i could have gotten out of
that um
all right we're also entering
in no particular order here we're
entering a phase of the pandemic
where we're going from a place where
trump was
arguably the worst choice for the job
because early in the pandemic what the
public
seemed to want is some kind of
empathy and plain talking about how bad
it was
now unfortunately or depending on your
point of view
fortunately this is either a feature or
a bug
this president doesn't know how to talk
negative
he just doesn't know how to say things
are going to get worse
it's also why we like him those of you
who do like him
because he's he's an internal optimist
no matter how bad things are it's going
to get better
make america great again it's optimism
is his primary
feature but if you end up in a pandemic
in the early start of it you know in the
beginning where really you do have to
just tell the public
look this is going to be bad you know i
got to be honest with you this is gonna
be bad
but we need to pull together he isn't
that guy
all right if we if we can be honest no
matter how much you love the president
he's just not that guy he's not the guy
who delivers bad news and makes you feel
comfortable with it it's just not
but that was the guy we needed
you know a few months ago if we had had
an election then
maybe he would have lost and maybe that
would have been fine if we could get
somebody in who
was good on that phase it wasn't really
you know an option
but where are we going to be around
election day well i think that no matter
what's happening with the virus
whether we get our drugs and vaccines or
not
we're going to be working on the economy
more than we're working on
saving lives because i think the
therapeutics and the way we're treating
people is so good that the death rate's
going to come down
probably keep coming down if the stuff
we learned about vitamin d is true
that death rate is going to plunge more
if the vaccine works
the optimism alone will be good for the
economy but the
death rate will plunge again so we're
entering a phase where you could
almost guarantee that the rebuilding the
economy will be more important than
fighting the virus fairly soon
you know we're talking about this winter
we're going to be talking about the
economy more
who is the best person you've ever seen
for that phase trump
i would argue that just as it is true
that he was the wrong personality for
the first part of the pandemic
you don't want him talking about medical
stuff
because he uses hyperbole you don't want
that
right you don't want medical
conversation
with hyperbole that's a bad bad
combination
you don't want the eternal optimist to
be the one who has to deliver bad news
every day
it just doesn't work it doesn't work
and i've said this before everybody who
thinks there's such a thing as a good
president and a bad president
doesn't really understand how the world
works
there's no such thing as a good
president or a bad president
there is such a thing as a president
who is right for the situation
i would argue that obama was right for
the situation he picked up in his first
term
i wish it was an economy on the edge and
we just wanted
we wanted a um a reassuring voice
and obama brought that we wanted
somebody that we knew would look at the
details
obama gave us that so he was a perfect
fit
for taking us off the edge of the
economic thing
he would not be a perfect fit if you put
him into the presidency to
let's say in november and say okay obama
your job is to goose the economy
not the right guy you know he's solid
but he's not the one who's going to put
the the rocket fuel on it
he's not the rocket fuel guy we've only
had one president who's the rocket fuel
guy
and that's the one you got so i would
argue
that the president is moving from the
phase where he would be the least
fitted that you know empathy
no optimism stuff and moving into the
place where
you could not descend you couldn't
design
a better situation for this president to
fit into
he he's the comeback president he's
you know he came back from his own uh
business losses in the past
he came back from being behind clinton
he's behind biden right now he's
probably going to come come from behind
and beat
biden and he's going to pick up an
economy that he had roaring
they got whacked by the virus and i
think
literally nobody on the planet
and of 7 billion souls i don't think
there is one better person for this
specific need
than president trump that's what i think
um
all right um i'm hearing some
i'm hearing some uh talk about mail-in
votes and
uh versus absence-y balance and
the people who are arguing that we have
experience with mail-in but we also have
experience with
absentee and some states have done full
mail-in for a while
so the people who say that the mail-in
vote will be dependable
and credible are also saying
that it's no problem because we've
tested it enough in these states we'll
just do what they did it'll be fine
but here's the part they get wrong
2020 is not like any other year
because you don't have any baseline of
expectation
so that let's say the votes came in and
they were
five percent different than they would
have been if people voted in in person
what's it tell you nothing
if we had had a history of voting by
mail
and then this year there was something
different in the outcome and you look at
it and go huh
these numbers don't look real it looks
like this district
faked something over there so if you had
a if you had a baseline of doing this
all the time you could maybe detect
if some some mischief had happened
but 2020 there's no baseline we haven't
done it before
we expect massive cheating because it's
america and
people will cheat if they can we don't
know
because of the coronavirus what the vote
would have looked like we don't know if
the polling is accurate because of the
shy trump voters we have no way to know
that the outcome we get is anywhere near
the truth
that's different so everybody who says
hey hey hey
we've done mail and before we know how
that works
is missing the biggest part of the
decision
which is wait wait it's 20 20. if you
had said this
in any prior year i would say yeah
yeah that might be dependable enough
even 2016. i would have said yeah
we know how many people vote we've got a
good handle on it we would detect
any mischief we would see it not in
2020.
in 2020 it will be completely hidden by
all the other noise
from the coronavirus to shy trump
supporters to the polls being you know
not
credible entirely
so here's what i would suggest
i think the sooner the government gives
the public
a clear path in terms of what would
happen
under different scenarios the sooner we
can start arguing about the rules
instead of figuring out how to kill each
other when it all goes bad
so i would like to see the the
government
in some form just put out a flow chart
that says this is our understanding of
if we
get to election day and we don't have a
result we're going to do this
these people will be in charge and they
will give us this
outcome then if we still don't have a
result we can trust
and i'm just making this part up uh on
this date
we'll have the supreme court decide
again i'm just making this all up
the supreme court will decide if we
should hold the second election
if we should just do it again or they
might decide to just do it in
a couple of problem areas maybe there's
a state or
some counties that look like like
they're not reliable
so it doesn't matter what the process is
so long as it looks
credible on paper it's presented well in
advance
so that we can live with it for a while
i want to be able to live with the idea
that no no this isn't going to be like
normal elections we will not have a
result on election night
then the process will be the follows
let's say the process is that we don't
uh that we ask the networks not to
report who is even ahead
suppose you just don't report it and you
wait till the votes are counted
and there's some kind of official sign
off before the networks can give you
any results maybe you just say there's
no news on this
you just can't report the news until all
the votes are counted
how about that i don't could he make
that stick i don't know if it would even
work
but it doesn't matter what the process
is my point is you have to get the
public
pregnant with that process now
you don't want to wait till election
night and have the public find out for
the first time
where it goes big big mistake
that is a civil war-sized mistake
if you don't educate the piss out of the
public
i'm not talking about having some news
stories or doing a release
that says what will happen under these
conditions i'm talking about
blanketing the brains of the public with
it until
every every person who might vote can
recite
exactly what will happen if we don't get
you know a clear result in a quick time
frame through the normal process
what happens what's that look like does
nancy pelosi become
the supreme leader or something i don't
know
all right i've talked too long i've gone
on too long
and i think that's it for now and i will
talk to you later
